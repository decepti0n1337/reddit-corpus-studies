Sadly no as i havent played the game for abit and have no real plans to.

---
I thought there was 6-7 vendors
---
Can't wait been reading on new up coming patches. making it a weight cape for your person only to 1000 pounds so all that extra poof gone...hope its not on the 24 cuz that's real soon
---
Forever a sneaky/sniper type player. 
---
Probably already said but need search lights 
---
PS4
---
I'm on Xbox, I'm afraid.
---
Purification farm good idea
---
Whitespring and Fissure Site Prime are the best spots, sure, but that doesn't mean no other spot is worth nuking.  I personally like nuking Harper's Ferry since it's a great place for Violet and Crimson Flux.  Morgantown and Charleston are also pretty good places to nuke.
---
A month later and I'm still using heating coils. I have scraped dozens of super sledges.
---
How is it not a bug? If a player exploits ingame mechanics to force a non consenting player into an unwinnable combat situation isn't that a glitch to get around the "gentlemans agreement" pvp system? 
---
They had an explosive rifle with a high rate of fire, didnt get a look to see for sure, but my guess was a TSE handmade.
---

---
I'm level 125, and spent most of the game solo, but I did find myself a TSE 10mm. I prefer my combat rifle for stealth though.
---
All this happened a couple hours after I killed someone (lvl 61) for a 40 cap bounty, who came after me for revenge six or seven times. I didnt take his loot, just removed the bounty and went on my way. He followed me from the county fairgrounds to deathclaw island. I guess he had team mates too, as two more players showed up. One watched, while another (lvl 84) started pelting me a gauss rifle. After defending myself for five minutes or so, the third player walked over and vomitted on the lvl 61's dead body, and that was the end of it.
---
A bit of a toxic night, but in the end, I was considering moving my camp anyways.
---
On the opposite end of it, I partnered with a player who looked lost in a nuke zone. Softened up a bunch of ghouls for them to finish off. I went to see their camp, and built them a new bed, fusion generator, cooking stove, and replace their turrets with heavier ones.
---
Dang
---
My mistake
---
Well done :)
---
I’ve never been able to play any Bethesda game as anything but stealthy.  Be it stealth ranged (bow, rifle, pistol, throwing weapon) or stealth melee
---
Why alert every enemy to your whereabouts when you can pick off a number of them first.
---
As for scorch beasts, my anti armour lever rifle takes them down in 4-5 shots (normal, Crit, normal, crit, normal)
---
Yeah, but bobbleheads? They might have put some sort of individual tracking in to eventually allow us to display and customize them on a bobblehead stand.
---
We just do not know how things are represented behind the scenes. I don't think we should be as confident as you are. 
---
Fuck em. Let them downvote, its only a matter of time before Beth cracks down on them (i hope)
---
She is probably just running to hide behind a tree like all mobs do when you try to get out of reach :D
---
[deleted]
---
No, it’s a random glitch I came across, I just repaired my broken dragon, slept to get the well rested buff and went to reload it and it just had 8, I should have tested to see if they all did damage or were just blank shots
---
Bethesda tried to hotfix it this week in fairness
---
Looks cool nice timing
---
Jesus what assholes
---
Too many people will quit. Including me. This is a dumb idea, and you either have too much free time on your hands or have not played very much. I dont want the \*countless\* hours I have spent farming to get what I have wiped, because frankly I would not want to reinvest that time again. It is what it is now, and new DLC or tweaks to change the favored weapons/armor can adjust it to be much better without a wipe.
---
Just friend requested you both. Let me know a good time. I'll probably be on 9:30pm EST or so.
---
The psn community system turned me off the first time I had a look at it.. but always happy to add another fellow girl gamer :) see you in the wasteland sometime!
---
The game released about 2 months ago. It's now nearly a month since the last patch.
---
Let that sink in for a minute.
---
The game as a whole is a broken mess; a playable one, but nonetheless. It's unfathomable how they can't even do the bare minimum required to support an MMO. Major things like duping have from the start to be fixed right the fuck now, not maybe in a few months. Same for most everything that breaks left and right. Focussed hot fixes have to happen daily, multiple times if necessary, until the game is mostly ironed out and fit for purpose. 
---
What are these buffoons doing instead? At first a handful of small fixes and of course big nerfs two or three times and then nothing. Granted there were the holidays in between but they could've put actual commitment into it way before that. 
---
It seems like there are one or two people left working on the game and the rest is already slaving away on the next masterpiece. 
---
Is the suppressor perk viable for non automatic rifles?
---
How much do u think 5.56 would sell for because i have a metric ton
---
r/iamverybadass
---
how is that great for low levels? It's a level 34 perk...
---
What's that perk for? 
---
You most likely have the bug that persists after a singular server shutdown. 
---
What happened when you restarted the game?
---
My I cant aim for shit and I always die I need to make a load out that revives me when I die because of that but I am level 200 so you can do it sister.
---
If you didn't want PvP why did you buy this game? They were very clear before release about what this game was and what settings would be in it.
---
That people are dickheads? Because unless there is something I'm missing here thats all I've figured out. 
---
if we are taking realism, real life doesn't crash every 30 minutes.
---
Yep. I was having no problems with mine and then all of a sudden log ins would tell me they cant place my camp. Being that I log out at my camp every time, I go to investigate who took my good spot and nothing is ever there. I search everywhere within what would be my camp area and nothing. Takes a couple more attemps before it places again and then Im good for a few more days. 
---
Lol don’t be terrified.  Trust me the name is an old joke of sorts... It was my rap name back when I though I could rap (I quickly realized I am not very good at it.)  It’s just cause I have a babyface.  My twin brother went by garbage pail Killa - so it was like a do.  I still use the name for my beats and DJ mixes though lol  I have a very real and serious job in real life but it’s healthy to relax and have fun with music or fallout! 
---
Good riddance.  Fuck those piece of shit ex's who are trying to tell you how you should be/do/feel/act/play.  They can go wank off alone being sad that no one understands them while you will find a person who gives a shit about your feelings and respects the idea that you are a person and therefore entitled to decide how to live your goddamn life.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sorry... I got steamed...  There's no goddamn reason in the universe to be such a self-absorbed whiny asshole as the guys you are describing.  I hope they get hit by busses.
---
Well last two times I’ve travelled back to my camp one of my turrets has turned hostile at some point prior and destroyed most of my camp.
---
So if you like clicking the rebuild all button that is the point of turrets
---
Heard that 
---
I think the fried it.
---
No, T-51 also has a jetpack. And I think maybe T-60 as well.
---
I already have an explosive Gatling and a two shot Gatling dropped last night. Just curious one which would offer max DPS for SBQ runs. The explosive is great for farming but the game often lags and I end up shooting too close and one shotting myself. In that sense it might be safer to run the two shot. 
---
So complete dehydration with healing factor still drains my health about 1hp every 3 seconds
---
My first SB Kill.. Thanks! 
---
It's completely pointless
---
*dupes items, causing game to endure huge amounts of lag*
---
*omg this game is broken 0/10*
---
[removed]
---
I've sold for 1 caps per round before
---
Oof. Hope you didn't spend much time on that.
---
This is the kind of info I was wondering about for this Poseidon blast zone. Hardly any flux from what I could see. 
---
Just from my experience, it seems like they need a completely flat surface to do their landing animation. Every time I’ve fought one near a paved road they always choose to land directly onto it, at least.
---
In your example, maybe their pathing wasn’t working great because there were two of them trying to land at the same time? It also feels like they have a timer that prevents landing prior to 30-60 seconds of combat, but I’m really not sure.  I’m just happy the shotgun method prevents these fights from becoming five minutes of non-stop screeching and projectile attacks (usually, at least).
---
Lol end game nuke boss
---
I dont. I want the game to be more fun to new players so they stay and populate the game
---
Thanks!
---
Your exes sound like assholes. 
---
Also, you sound like me. I have put well over 1000 hours into the last 3 Fallout games and rarely complete more than half the main questlines. I am constantly hidden, and sell all my chems. 
---
Did it wipe everyone out??
---
I'm in game now, dude
---
If you have 15cha in special, x-cell does nothing to effect prices as 15 is the cap that can effect prices on vendors.
---
Once again, grape mentats does what x-cell for vendor prices and the bonus of "better prices" is merely meaningless text that should have been removed as it will not improve prices if you already have 15 cha.
---
I am the same way, sneak everywhere, take my time and horde junk. I too killed my first scorchbeast the other day after complaining about how difficult the things are. Repaired the AA gun near a fissure site and just kept shooting til it landed. Then I used my blade of baset to melee it to death. I was so proud of myself.
---
I have done scorched queen in it, and never had a problem using it for any PvE content at all, plus it gives tons of carry weight.
---
Elaborate? It gets Jeremy, and only in one direction. Changing controllers doesn’t help.
---
Same here. On Xbox.
---
I encountered this same problem yesterday. I don't think it has to do with screen size though. 
---
Trying to solve the liberator problem once and for all!
---
Legal binding contract doesn’t equate to law 
---
Not sure if they will implement such a thing but someone  extracted a file from the game with all the plans and converted it to a tickable spreadsheet.
---
I posted about helping a kid here last week.  I got mostly positive responses, but a handful of people called me a liar or pedophile.  That was nice.
---
Glad he ran into some good peeps :-)
---
Just enjoy the game at your own pace. It’s not like it’s going anywhere anytime soon. You do you!
---
What happens if you of radiation?
---
Pretty nice
---
Do bobble heads perks go away when you die? Cause then theoretically each one may only last 5 minutes if he dies enough lol 
---
This is a great suggestion. Crippling Scorchbeast limbs should be a thing if it isn't already. 
---
Until PvP is improved dramatically, I think of it as a co-op multiplayer with friendly fire enabled in a really shitty way.
---
Also stealth pc gamer lady. PM if you want to add my tag on fo76
---
Oof. you've still got nothing of value to say. 
---
For recipes just check a cooking station. Should show you anything you have a recipe for. Same on chemistry benches. For plans it can be a little harder to check what you already know since you actually have to open the camp editing screen and scroll through everything to see what you have. 
---
There
---
Not sure I bailed. However I was trying to think what the purpose of it was and all I could think was to kill a bunch of ppl or the computer in the silo doesn't show a nuke there.
---
Yeah that would also be great! I must admit, I like the being in the presence of other players that are not exactly PvP inclined. There's something about provoking a fight with an innocent that is so very "waistland raider". Stealing from innocents is also very fun 
---
Shit eh
---
Only if he's also named. Like "Jeff" or something.
---
Weird. When on put pacifist mode on this never happens to me. And I have both the nuke and the electrical discharge mutations.
---
Just move your base it will fix it
---

Nocturnal weapons is bugged. Every single nocturnal weapon I got, damages the most during the day, and loses +50% damage during the night. Directly the opposite of how its supposed to work. 
---
If you see this, screenshot and report them. In fact we should have a thread dedicated to calling out dupers.
---
As long as you have fun who cares.  It’s a hobby not a job. 
---
No... that’s not how contracts work...
---
Really though! Almost two months after release and duping is still happening on a mass scale and there hasn't been so much as a single word on bans or removing the duped items. This is not normal for an online game! This is really, really, really far away from normal! World of Warcraft, GTA Online, freaking PET SIMULATOR, all ban for this kind of thing ffs!
---
I have: Auto Assault, combat rifle x3, plasma gun, submachine gun. All prime.
---
Uh huh. Tell me more.
---
Bwhahhahahahhahah man alll these kids raging at the loot table. Lololollololol
---
Do u know about springs? What could I sell them for?
---
Well I mean, if you've only hit level 20-30, then it wouldn't be that drastic of a hit. The first 20 or so levels go by incredibly quickly when using the extremely easy to come by xp bonuses and farming events.
---
I think the intention might be that in a team, when going into a silo for example, you have focuses in different areas, one hacking, one lock picking, one ranged, one melee.
---
Of course, the fact you can swap perks at any time makes this mute and more of an annoyance.
---
Either make instances where you can’t change perks after entering until leaving,
---
Or
---
Make like 3 passive perk slots that are separate from all other perks (or perhaps one per special) that can be equipped at a time.
---
An unexpected surprise, bu a welcome one
---
Sadly Its not :( i already tried it
---
Thought I had a sweet setup with 4 rocket turrets and some spotlights. Little did I know scorched can pinpoint a shot from 3 miles away with a damn pipe pistol
---
Welcome. That was a quick one!
---
....Huh.
---
Diluted is more efficient when crafting with chemist and super duper.
---
ATM I have over 400 stims
---
I don't need either, how much you want to pay?
---
Ok, yes full item wipe seems much better, I agree.
---
The likelyhood of someone doing this again is really small. You got unlucky. I’d just move on.
---
I'm playing with a sneaky build and I'm lvl 41, and haven't killed a single scorchbeast yet, I really like playing sneak in Bethesda's games.
---
Oh lord its 5 per spring or five per bulk spring?
---
Bethesda is blame. If there’s any exploit in gaming that gives you an edge or helps you make more money, it’s gonna be abused. Idk if Bethesda are working for a fix but this is just pathetic. Y’all can’t expect people not to dupe. I hope Bethesda does something about this. 
---
I'd nuke a friend's camp just for the laughs.
---
5 per spring
---
That's weird. Guess it was a bug or somrthing. I'll try to get back on after I finish an errand I have to run. Thanks for letting me know.
---
If you have electrically charged I recommend staying away from other players around the white springs area. This exact situation has happened to me several times. It sucks but aside from just avoiding other players there really isn't much to do about it. I have marsupial too though so when it happens now I just jump where no one can get me then server hop. 
---
I only have 4k caps so I mean, is 400 each alright to you?
---
I require updates on how many men flood your inbox with bullshit fuckery
---
You die
---
Search lights don't work. I have a horse shoe shaped build with my crops in the courtyard. Missile turrets on each roof pointing inward with search lights under each ( roof overhangs) I can stand there getting pounded by mole rats and they don't do anything at all
---
If I recall correctly, there is a 4 barrel black powder rifle in the game somewhere. Not really helpful to your question but on the off chance you dont know about it...
---
I just want them to add anything that is a challange
---
consider myself properly modified
---
Cap stash runs
---
Haven't found a single one either. Never been actually searching for one, it may be selling as a mod somewhere.
---
The self-projection is strong in this one lol. you look like the typical incel that thinks that you only have to be nice with girls if you want to have sex with them.
---
Fuck dupers. They're ruining the god damn playability of the game with their greed. WHO THE FUCK NEEDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BOBBLEHEADS? NOBODY. Put a power drill through your HDD.
---
I wouldn’t mind that wood though honestly haha just a bit of it man... I need to make more walls •_•
---
What Would you want as payment? I got over 1000 diluted atoms and a hand full of other legendaries and chems
---
At this point it's far to late and the best option would be hoping they can make some code that can delete duped items. 
---
NON GMO MIRELURK STEAKS GET YOUR NON GMO MIRELURK STEAKS!
---
90% of legendaries are crap and provide no real benefit and so they are junked.  
---
  
---
You will find paper bags strewn everywhere because of this 
---
No shit sherlock
---
That be a weird game.  Puppets would be our companions 
---
But you don't need open every picklock or unlock every terminal. If you have the perk then is easy and fast, if no then you don't lost anything. If you change your perk cards then you lose time. Convenience is always a gameplay resource. Just pick a thing and stick to that. The character don't need be a jack of all trades.
---
Of course, loadouts are expected in games like this, I want this QoL feature. But be able to unlock all without a perk is just OP IMO.
---
You do you, there's no wrong way to play if you're enjoying it.
---
Same here. When I first started playing I would confuse other players for either Scorched or Ghouls. I hit the first 12 players I met in the game. In my defense, it was almost always dark when I encountered other players, or I was always defending myself from either Scorched or Ghouls at the time.
---
I would think they would despawn over time, I don’t know if they do when someone leaves, but I found that plasma where it shouldn’t have been.  I like to think that someone was leaving it for someone who could use it and not just stowing it because they needed to cut weight.  Later to find that it was removed making me a thief.

Sounds like you dodged two bullets.
---
In College Station? I used to live there. There is a HUGE gaming community there. I was in the A&amp;M league of legends group about 6 years back, and Clockworks has gaming tournaments quite often - I’m sure the community has grown since then. Cstat is NOT “populated by only country girls”, but if that’s your excuse...
---
Those big stairs that are like 2 foundations wide will cause that problem every time. I seriously hope Bethesda changes that cuz it drives me nuts.  
---
I'd recommend adding those stairs at the very end of your build, if you can. Otherwise, you can do like markgatty suggested and just move your base to pack it all up. 
---
Where? Shop or random found it in the map?
---
You shouldn't have covered up his name if he is on xbox or ps4 you should have posted his gt
---
Not really a dumb idea, just one you are opposed to. It's worked successfully before. Not saying it's the best option but it IS an option nonetheless.
---
Are you on ps4? It’s my first time playing a game on ps4 and my bf kept wanting me to get into video games. I mostly use VATS also. I’m level 97 and I’m proud of myself for it. 😭
---
You mean 1.2k tonnes?
---
Sounds to me like they need screenshots shared, uncensored.
---
Shout out to everyone who joined must of had over 10 there, we made it look easy 
---
It’s a travesty that Bethesda has yet to fix this long lasting issue. 
---
One of my favorite things to do is run around whitesprings when it gets nuked- find a group of glowing ghouls and pop a flare in the air so the guys that are farming can run over. 
---
Saves me a ton of ammo since I’m a sniper build- but I think it’s just kind of fun.
---
They don’t always get what I’m doing- but today I got a lot of thumbs up emotes so I guess at least one group did 
---
F those guys. My hubby plays through quests pretty fast, and I do it the same as you. We did it with WoW, SWTOR, and any other game we play.
---
He is always a higher level and better at combat but he never belittles me because he sees value in how I find little things he misses, or am better at crafting. 
---
You bought this game and it’s yours to enjoy how you wish. And I get the anxiety thing, I definitely have those issues too which is why I keep my headset off and never join others, but even with the occasional jump scare, I find it relaxing when I build my camp or get what I need for crafting. All that matters is you find a way to enjoy it.
---
If you're on PC I'd buy 200 springs at 5 each
---
It's also Bethesda's ignorance when it comes to stuff like this. Most devs prioritize work to fix exploits like this. They don't seem to care.
---
I have spent more caps on already known plans than I have on fast travel.  
---
There is a 15% faster reload for both the dragon power and regular powder. As well as TSE. I had a normal black powder with 15% reload, +10% dmg if mutated and explosive

---
I did this, but it can't be a permanent solution to move my base, pay a fee and rebuild all the stuff everytime something like this happens.
---
400C?
---
But why board of all things. 
---
I have to say, this was my first thought. I suppose it depends on the kid, but I'm 38 so I have a lot of friends with kids that age and I can't imagine any of them being able to process images of scorched and ghouls having their heads literally blown off and splattered all around.
---
ive got one , ignore 50 % of armor but doesnt reload faster, my friend got one, increase  damage x 2 doesn't reload faster too...
---
It should show a dot to the left of the name that invites you in recent or friend just long press start dont open the menu the hit social it bugs out a lot 
---
You're dealing with 2 groups. The dupers, and the redditors that are  tired of seeing all the posts about dupers. 
---
Thanks! Equipping the item did nothing (and it was a trash level 1 item), but leaving and entering a new server fixed it.
---
I am going to try to be as straight forward as I can be with you. I don't know if you will ever see my comment or not but here goes.
---
 Games are fun if you enjoy them. Being a pro doesn't have to be the endgame. If any aspects of the game are what you enjoy doing, then do them. If you feel like you're not good at a game but it is fun just keep at it. 
---
If it becomes work or no longer entertains you that is when you take a break or stop. You have free time? Use it any way you see fit. The point is if you and I mean just you, enjoy something, own it. Never let any one override your own choices. This life is yours to live. If you start letting other make these decisions for you, you may end up stuck in a life you're not going to be happy living.
---
Now then on to the ex's and future ones. The person you are dating, should be trying to help you better yourself or being the best friend you've ever had. Calling you names or talking down to you those are the ones to avoid as they are not worth your time. 
---
You need to be supported and you need to be able to do ANYTHING you want to do in life. When you find your person they'll be patient and just be happy you are happy. The look on a face as you enjoy the little things is one of the most pure images and memories to make. Why degrade the day with these needless cut downs?
---
Your time here is your time, no one else's. You have every right to be unhappy with the way you've been treated. You go have all the fun in 76 you want. I personally have well over 40 hours on 76 just building my camps.
---
I hope I didn't sound preachy or arrogant and if you ever feel let down by life pm me. I'll try to cheer you on anyway I can. 
---
Best wishes,
---
Port.
---
Yeah, this is the weakest point of OP’s overall shitty post.
---
I mean melee *should* be stronger then range in a vacuum, with range having the advantage of well, range (and able to damage multiple enemy’s at once) melee should outperform range on a stationary unmoving target to make it fair, now maybe melee does to much more damage then range I wouldn’t know, I think melee is also just more fun then range and am happy it’s even viable in the first place 
---
Ok that’s better, ty
---
No. Someone "baiting" into PvP (impossible with passive mode) or "blowing up my camp" (maybe don't camp at Whitesprings). 
---
ELI5? I think I don't understand what's going on 
---
The mods each have a rarity rating, so you're not guaranteed to get them depending on what it is.
---
For sure Tesla/Gauss mod learning is pretty rare in my experience.
---
I’ve just accepted it at this point. I still won’t dup but every time Bethesda patches it they find a new one. Face it unfortunately it’s gonna stay a broken economy for probably forever 
---
It's not a contract tho..
---
This is just a creative writing exercise 
---
I hate those fuckin cave crickets
---
So he's a duper that kills other dupers? Is he in the duper closet?
---
Salty.  
---
Pathetic white knights in this post. Get fucked you suck bitch 
---
He's right, why the attitude? 
---
i love you 
---
There's already a method of duping Atom shop items, it's just kept super private
---
So you say things that make you look like a neck-beard and mock people for being excited by playing a game you also supposedly enjoy? Cool.
---
Thanks man
---
!!!!
---
Thank you for sharing! It worked just fine for me until the 1st (I believe there was a mini-patch?) then I had to switch it out for the first one because I was afraid of losing my power armor &gt;.&lt;;; I'm glad it works for you though! It's a relief that it isn't broken for everyone lol.
---
If the likelyhood is so small then how come another person in the thread has said it has happened to them multiple times? And I guarantee the guy who did it to me will do it to someone else.

My base was nuked yesterday, and I came back to it today to try and repair it. When I select the "repair all structures" the game crashes.

Oh there will be several desperate sad dudes trying this shit out lolol

With all the mutation benefits and perk sharing I’m always surprised more people don’t accept my friend requests. I don’t know cover them to necessarily quest or hangout with me, I just want my herd mentality mutation to not ding me 2 specials. I also have empath which reduces my group members damage by 25%- win/win. I’m JunkMustard on X1 if anyone wants a mutation/charisma buddy, friend me and I’ll accept group invites when online.
---
I took it as a sarcastic answer, i tough something else happened if your whole health bar was just radiation
---

---
It's both really. The duping action requires you to amass enough items to crash yourself off of the server, because it can't handle the asinine amount of items these people are generating.

I would loove to see something more about these fog crawlers.. they‘re so rare and I never played far harbor.. so im asking myself wtf they are doing in West Virginia

I’m on Xbox as well. And I’m level 73 and more than willing to help with anything I’m able to.

 That's how I play. My brother is lvl 91, I'm lvl 51. But I know all the ins and outs, him not so much. 
---
It's a mutation not a perk. +20 carry weight and minus I think 4 intelligence but you get a super jump. 
---
Excellent!
---
The only reason I have electrically charged is because I got it just after marsupial and I don't want to take the risk of using a radaway. 
---
I didn't know that, but it makes sense.
---
Pretty rare seems like a bit of an understatement. I've only ever found one Gauss rifle, and less than probably 5 Tesla's. You'd think if the drop rate is that low, the mod learn rate wouldn't be even lower than that.
---
To prgress to the next chapter you should need to have done the main story for that perticular chapter, so like now, the only way to get to chapter 2 servers should be to kill the scorchbeast queen, then you are now placed in servers with other who have done the same (unless you choose to join chapter 1 servers with friends again)
---
I do. No shame in my game. This isn’t r/femaleempowerment. She’s karma-mining, and she can take that weak-ass game to the feminists on the other side of reddit. 
---
Here you go sir, take a [look](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad05b1/armor_resistances_google_sheet/?)
---
I just make junk runs and sell to each vendor faction for 1400 a day. Helps to have water purifies as others have said. I also sell most 1 star legendaries to vendors since it will take longer to sell in market. Pretty much if you sell to vendors each day you can have 9800 caps in a week. 
---
The praise the sun emote from dark souls
---
I see them every time we hit fissure prime but we 2 or 3 man the queen and people have been getting mad because we kill her before they can get to the event 
---
I just went under defense and put up the tall concrete walls around my camp instead.  Works great.  Enemies target them instead and they have a ton of hp
---
platform
---
Don't carry all your junk around with you. I lost a shitload in similar circumstances. It's a harsh lesson to learn. 
---
Never heard of that vendor. Where may he be located haha 
---
Im on xbox
---
Isn't it though, so much hate floating around. She fell into that trap and now she can't get enough. We're happy to have our friend back AND be rocking the sweet Appalachian Wastes!
---
I had one of my own turrets aggro on me. After 3 days I just removed the turret. It was annoying.
---
Yeah, i see what you mean in everything you've said. I agree with you including in some aspects where you disagree with me.  
---
Fallout 76 brings new meanings for old stuff
---
* **Junk** yeah, i feel it too. ONly recently i realized i needed a rule: keep 100 of everything. When you reach it, just drop the rest. It's so easy to go obcessive collector and start collectingall kinds of items. The last time i've fast traveled was 10 days ago heh but mostly because i'm collecting weapons and because i don't care walking the map thought you do miss some events that way.
---
* **Settlements** \- yeah, gameplay-wise it is a divergence introduced in Fo 4. At first i didn't build much in Fo4 but but story-wise i started to like it and was drawn to building more. But i get what you're talking. Some friends just skipped that part of the game completely. On the other i know some people that spend more time building than doing quests. I like it balanced but i understand those who love/hate it.
---
## The online gameplay stuff
---
* **workshops**: not sure if that's because i'm not in endgame yet but i do use them, specially power plants for fusion core and workshops that give resources used to craft ammo (steel/lead/crystal/etc)
---
"I think You give it waaaay to much credit. It's fun game;) Don't read to much into it mate;)" - yeah, i like to dream heh :p
---
# The Bad
---
* **NPCs** \- Yeah, very likely! I wonder how far they're going to push the story with updated content!
---
* **rebuilding Appalachia**: what do you think they could do to make the game better in the sense? while i feel the need to rebuild Appalachia i can't think of practical stuff gameplay-wise. Maybe it is a good subject for another thread. But definitely would be good to go into that direction in future updates
---
* **bugs** \- yeah, thats true. and the game doesn't come with a cheap price tag. They probably rushed just to release on 23 Oct (start of the great war for those who don't remember)
---
* **server** \- lucky indeed! while gameplay bugs didn't botter me much server stability was my main big problem. Maybe it's my location
---
# Why the hate?
---
Yes, you're right. That's because i'm glad people are actually posting bug lists and all kinds of helpful stuff here on reddit. Most YT rant videos are just that: rant. And while they have every right to rant (both rants about the game and the bad merchandise products - awful play by Bethesda here) there were some people that just went in the hype and were not being honest with the good part. But indeed we should be relentless about what Bethesda delivers to us.
---
\***ABOUT NUKES!!**
---
Indeed i had a mixed feeling about nukes that i couldn't understandyet but now  that you've said i think that's what had an odd feeling on it. Gameplay-wise i admit i had fun in nuke zones (but i'm not in the end game so it was a challenge for me and a way to put my build to test. 
---
But yes, the nukes are just too frequent (because they're one of the few end-game content) and cover a too small area. I imagine it's hard to balance a feature like that in the game. Should they remove the blast zone indicator before the nuke touches? It would definitely spice things up in terms of nuking players and player's camps and definitely they would be way more dreaded. Especially if they made it reach a bigger area. Maybe you wouldn't be able to fast traver untill the nuke hit the ground. **That** would be more scary. 
---
I had an ex like this, even though I don’t mind some combat games, I prefer doing puzzles and side quests. He told me I was shit because he kept beating me at COD, a game I had never played at the time and we were playing on his PlayStation which I hadn’t played much (I had an Xbox) so I wasn’t used to the controls.      
---
Thankfully when I meet my husband he just got me, one of the first gifts he bought me was Disney infinity for my wii, and when the Nintendo Switch came out he bought me one straight away so I could play Mario.      
---
The right guy won’t care about how you play the game, he’ll only care that you enjoy playing it 
---
Good advice, never thought of those outfits. 
---
Oh Clayton Bigsby, you foolish man.
---
I HATE the enclave since fallout 3... and what happened to dad ;(
---
it's a place where there is a lot of room where they test everything, usually to get there u type in the console cqc QASMOKE or something and you got all the items,props, buildings in the game. The thing is how can we get there without cheats ? I'm trying to find my way here to get all the beautiful paintjob and paint them for everyone who ask for free but i can't find someone who want to share, so i think cheating/hacking is involved
---
dont forget who was supposed to make a game that should not have this available
---
Probably. I was being conservative with my math.
---
Hmm... if its minimal damage adn you're taking pain, are you sure a player hasnt damaged you from a distance away since trying to initiate PVP does damage the victim a bit, it's just very minimal?
---
Saving a screenshot to add you when I get home. 
---
You'll get the common mods quickly, but the rarer mods will take many weapons being scrapped/luck.
---
Pretty sure that's called huffing.
---
Sorry. 
---
The answer to everything is 42. 
---
But all seriousness I'm interested to know as well.
---
Have you checked the basement of Wightsprings?
---
That's exactly how I play too 
---
Congrats
---
God forbid dupers try and make their own fun in this godawful boring game. They clearly have regrets buying this game and have to resort to making some paypal money to get their money back, because Bethesda sure as shit won't do refunds on their own broken launcher.  
---
And it's on Bethesda to fix duping but SURPRISE; They can't because they're incompetent and they just don't care. When Bethesda starts selling actual weapons for actual money on the microtransactions store, that's when the duping will get adressed.  
---
So as a community, rally for microtransaction guns, because only then will duping get fixed.
---
😂😂😂
---
Good damn autocorrect 
---
Sounds like you're doing it right: having fun. Games aren't about winning or some shit like that. They are about having fun, being a challenge or taking your mind off things. If anything, your two knucklehead exes were playing the games wrong, as it doesn't sound like they had fun ☺️
---
Bethesda still hasn't even *acknowledged* this issue, right? That's what really grinds my gears. At least tell us you hear our frustrations and fears. Sticking their collective heads in the sand just makes it worse. Reminds me a bit of when No Man's Sky came out and when people were complaining that the game was advertised as multiplayer, and then had friends meet them on planers to test it, and the NMS creator just kept saying, "wow, look at how many people are playing!"
---
This sums up pretty much my experience and even a couple of my friends.
---
I grabbed the game a bit reluctantly, telling my playgroup I wouldn’t spend 60$ on a game without polish.
---
Lo and behold, I’m closing in in gametime to a friend who had been playing for a month before all of us got it.
---
Deal I’ll be on later today. Add me Forba18 
---
I've been playing fallout since 3, and that is always how i play. Their just assholes. It's called a Stealth Build.
---
Haha yes! I did get that one.
---
Pacifist just means *you* can’t do damage to other players. *Not* visa versa.
---
I wasnt planning on keeping it and I wasnt planning on getting into combat, in fact once my friend had arrived we were going straight too his camp nearby.
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Some people have said that radaway will only remove your most recent mutation but I have not tested that for myself. Currently I have marsupial, bird bones, healing factor, twisted muscles, grounded, speed demon, and electrically charged. For the most part everything balances itself out. Really the only one I ever have to worry about is the charged one because of how randomly it goes off. Especially with my base being right next to some white springs guards. 
---
I do like a lot the perk card system but i has a big flaw for me.
---
Having to switch perk cards constantly. LIke when you just want to lockpick something and you have to remove an Perception card, put lockpick, pick the lock, remove lockpick, but the perception card again. The same goes for crafting ammo, repairing armors and weapons, crafting turrets, bartering...  
---
Those perk cards really need to be active even when not equiped.  
---
That being said the perks are very nice and the progression (level requirement) is well balanced plus there is great variety and good synergy between the cards.
---
Yea. They have all the furniture and fancy lighting stuff that I am not interested in now. I think Graham sells what I am asking about but just looking for confirmation. Been a long time since I've seen him too, probably cuz I spend most of my time in Cranberry bog, Mire, and Divide. 
---
IMAGINE PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO READ WITHOUT CAPS LOCK ENABLED. 
---
That doesn't mean they're competitive. It means, simply, they're pathetic.
---
Dude was way wrong. Other power armors may have more protection, but the difference isn’t that much, excavator is best PA in game for that 100 pounds extra carry weight, use it for that more then anything else I have an X01 and ultracite I never use cause of carry weight. If I ever got the mod to give those extra 100 lbs I might but then eventually I’ll just get that for excavator too for 200 bonus weight excavator best in slot gear 
---
Lol, someone down voted me for liking this person's idea.
---
I also saw them there sometimes.. wouldnt it be nice if there was a Alternative boss other than the scorched queen? Something like a big mama fog crawler? ^^ or at least a quest since theres no information about them?
---
Nice, im looking forward to your findings. Dont the locations have different contents,
---
I'm surprised people bother finding grahm for signs &amp; letters. I've had them drop during quests or workshop defence quests at least 5-6 times
---
I keep some rad chems, stimpaks, grape mentats and sometimes stuff with a strength bonus and sell everything else 
---
 Absolutely awesome. I have never watched one of the YouTube videos or read an article about how horrible the game was. Didn’t matter to me. Been having fun with it since day one.
---
 Having went through a divorce during the release of The Division, it seemed like that was one of the things I did to pass the time at night. I loved it even though at first it was buggy, etc. it was still fun! Tell your friend chin up and have fun! And the best part is you all have each other again and are having fun socially with the game too!
---
Absolutely spot on.  Im a massive fallout fan and unfortunately listened to the negative reviews.  I never bought the game on release and instead bought red dead 2 the week Fo76 came out.  I was so excited for this release since the announcement,  but the constant bad press really switched me off to it.  Anyway long story short, I bought a digital copy over the holidays for £22, figuring if it's really that bad then it hasn't cost much.  I love it, it feels very like fo4 and is a beautiful colourful world with months worth of exploring.  I'm actually more invested in it than red dead 2 and am always looking to get back online with it (I never really got this from Rd). The lack of npc's aren't bothering me so far (30 hrs in).  My only annoyances are:
---
1) lagging and server drops (I actually lost a sniper rifle I had just found due to this)
---
2) The need to constantly eat and drink,  I seem to waste a lot of time revisiting areas I know will provide water and food and find this a bit restrictive. 
---
Kudos on the post and an upvote from me :)
---
350 :)
---
Eh depends on how you build ur character. I do pure builds cuz I like having a different builds that are super strong. If u spec into everything ur not gonna have enough points.
---
That's awesome, I'm glad more people are convincing, no not convincing. Showing people what a great game it can be. Sure its got rust and a little dirt but those can be polished off with a good friend or two. I'm hoping her story might inspire a few others!
---
Yeah anything would be fun we 2 man the queen in 4 minutes or better depending on how fast she lands so we need something fun to do 
---
I like!
---
Also, is there a sub specifically for these photos? I have some, but I feel like they would just get lost in the "this game sux, pay me 20,000 Caps for a duped explosive shotty" posts.
---
T-51b is lvl 30/40/50, only raider, excavator and t45 are available as lvl 45 variants. T51b has at lvl 50 514/514/370(it has the highest dr/er but the lowest rr of all pas) while T-60 has 460/430/475. Pa mods don't change the defense values. The massive downside of t51b: the mods are pretty rare compared to X01 and T60.
---
Are you sure that you compared a t51b and not a t45 (the strongest of the lvl 45 armors with 420/420/420) with your t60? The stats of a t51b are *noticably better* (rr is easily fixed with a radshield)
---
I learned a lot from this guy named Cordless VII on YouTube. He'll show you in this video. :)

You will respawn with about a quarter of the radiation taken away
---
I personally think this game was well worth pre ordering. 
---
Lol. We need a Clayton Bigsby meme for dupers. 
---
oh,, i am to late to the party :/
---
Appreciate it, unfortunately gave up on this game already
---
Totally not the point man. Is her excitement over a lower tier kill worthy of any less consideration than when you first did it? We all start as noobs and we all get excited over stupid shit when it first happens. It's not about politics or points of view. Who gives a flying fuck about her dating life and so what if she is mining? That's all background noise. Just be glad there's another person who loves the game and move the fuck on.
---
Speed demon mutation 
---
I've got a Fallout playing fiance and can confirm that they are wife material.
---
Indeed, you gotta try it instead of just checking youtube for reviews. Of course it’ll be filled with bad reviews, as they’re popular.
---
Hotter rod anyone?
---
Also how I play!
---
Intelligence crafting/stealth/charisma build
---
A group of low level players ask for my starting the enclave quests at the former senator's bunker, I was level 60+ so they must of thought I was a straight forward badass because they were all under level 20.
---
Of course the initial cave area is filled with death claws, which I would normally just stealth kill at my leisure or pacify.
---
I decide to pacify them as I start leading the newbies inside.....so obviously one of them starts attack the death claws bringing the whole nest down on us.
---
After a few newbie dropped with me hanging back and using the distraction of players running around, I was able to take care of the deathclaws eventually.
---
xD I guess it would help if I had a mic
---
Thanks
---
I'm afraid so.
---
Everytime i fight her i get like 2 crashes.. i can consider myself lucky when i even get her loot
---
What system are you on?
---
I think just walking up to the place that gives you the plans gave me enough black titanium from all the mole miners there 
---
Fire resistant 
---
Ps4 sorry I meant to put that in there 
---
Christ the downvotes for actually knowing how data is stored...
---
Ikr? Put this guy on blast.
---
If you need a ton of cobalt flux, that’s a dang good spot for it. 
---
i'm level 16 and i'm not an alt... =(
---
Game has been great so far, but a fairly big patch/update is supposed to hit in a week or so.  If you've held off this long I'd wait until the patch to see what sort of updates Beth is giving us.
---
That said, I've had many, many hours of fun in Appalachia so I've always thought it was worth the price.
---
Working as intended?
---
I'm sorry to hear that, Yes The Division was extremely underwhelming to begin with. But it was the smaller details that kept people going. Look at it now even I returned to give it a second chance and didn't regret it. The finer things require time to mature and 76 is still a baby. 
---
Also maybe we should be careful of what games we buy in future: A divorce around The Division and A Friend Group divided around Fallout. :)
---
Fuck them. I like to play that way too (sneaky snipers ftw). My fiance likes to charge right in (melee build) and complete the story as quick as possible, but I always remember where cool stuff is because I spent my time exploring and I also find the best loot. He doesn't make fun of me but when we play co-op we tend to do different things while hanging out out of game, but when we do fight together we wreck face. 
---
He can spot and enemy quicker than me, but I can spot a chest a mile away.
---
You're very kind sir! What's your GT
---
It is already.
---
Im not 100% on this but I think its triggered by someone going in/near there.
---
Ive only had it pop twice, once while I was there and another time when a lvl 8 had just been there.
---
The Camp Defiance BoS:Line in the sand event is an example of an event that is triggered by someone going/being there.
---
If it did then how would the dupers get bsck to the same server to collect their items???
---
You'll still encounter plenty of bugs. I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a game. You'll get your money's worth timewise most likely. I've put about 300 hours in, but having said that, I have enjoyed plenty of games more than this with only 50 hours or so played. Just my opinion. I'd certainly buy it again.
---
Rushed and unpolished?
---
You mean fallout 76?
---
I keep reading that people have trouble with crickets, but to me they're just as weak as other bug type creatures. A few hours ago i killed a legendary cricket outside Watoga no problem.
---
Good idea lol!
---
I give it a 9/10 right now.. Couple hundred hours of great fun plus a long future ahead of it dev wise. 
---
Different regions do, but by doing 200 maps (100 each player) at one dig, it should give a nice clean set of data 
---
I always help anyone that needs it! Everyone needs help from time to time 
---
Almost every online game like this has a duping glitch like this at or near launch
---
Who the hell says you're bad be cause you chose to play a certain way. Fuck them, honestly you could do better than those sorts. Congrats on killing that scorchbeast its a real accomplishment, you'll be taking on the queen before you know it. And if you ever need people to play with you're always welcome to join me and my friends
---
No I mean fallout new Vegas which obsidian where made to release in less than a year so they had to cut corners by making it shit 
---
I once looked and had like 35 of them stored
---
All the people like you left this sub a month ago
---
First of all over 4k 5.56 rounds! thanks for crashing the servers duper! (/s)    Secondly... why does he have 254 boards?  Is there a big spot on the black market for super mutant's boards? 
---
Thank you so much! Easier than I thought it would be. My camp looks great now!
---
It’s complete garbage that this is such a short timer and they’re both the PAS and PA skins are active at the same time.. Had been saving for these for a while but ended up grabbing some Christmas items before they expired. I now see that was the worst decision I’ve made in the game so far.
---
Same girl. It took me a bit but finally got to level 54 and made some good friends along the way! They don't mind that I prefer to scavenge and I get my ass kicked on the daily lol I just got a heavy melee weapon and smash things when they get too close. I have yet to take on a schorchbeast on my own, I am proud of you!
---
I saw that movie on netflix and thought it was pretty crappy.... Was expecting more after all the 42 jokes.... The evil paperwork guys were funny tho. 
---
In r/fo76FilthyCasuals you'll find that quite a lot of people, regardless of gender, play this way!  In fact if it ever gets brought up, most of us are like "is there any other way to play???"
---
Congratulations...on all your wins!!  You obviously deserve so much better!
---
Planting crops in fire pits looks great at night.

Diseased enemies also give you rads

How a trade screen between players most likely works, a short story from a former network engineer:
---
You prompt a trade with someone. Your computer tells the server you want to trade with other player, server tells other player's computer you want to trade. They agree, their computer sends signal of trade agreement to server, which goes to your computer. Now your computer sends your inventory info to the server, and other player's computer sends their inventory info to server as well. Your inventory is small, therefore less data, therefore faster loading. Other player's inventory is large, therefore more data, therefore slower loading. Once inventories are loaded in to the server, they are downloaded and displayed on the local computers.
---
Moral of the story: yes the fuck it does lag the servers.
---
Yes it is...
---
Beth strikes again!
---
Not all the time. It doesn't show for me up more often than not. 
---
Opinions are nice. It's been severely frustrating experience from the beginning and still needs more fixing. It had the potential to be really great but they released an unfinished project and that's unethical. I liked leveling up and looting but core functionality of the game re: events and challenges is still borked and that's not okay. Ive wasted hours trying to complete challenges that were just broken and that makes it garbage. Even apparent end game scorched queen battle was ruined by the game's built in mechanics since I foolishly teamed up with some rando inside my first silo and then died right before the launch room, not only missing the launch (thanks, rando dude, for waiting) but also getting locked out of the silo unable to retrieve my drooped loot AND unable to see the scorchbeast queen because I was too overburdened to fast travel. Not to mention I would have no idea a scorchbeast queen even existed if I hadnt read about it on reddit since i dont remember it mentioned anywhere in the game and particularly not in association with launching a nuke other than the optional quest to launch at a fissure. 
---
Sometimes, especially if there is server lag, there will be a delay in some/all of the loot spawning(without the spinning circle)..
---
I've come back 5 or so minutes later and found the standard loot
---
I'm a hoarder myself and like this idea.  How do you get your stash to your mule?  
---
Great news, thanks! 
---
I mean kinda? I generally keep about 20 waters on me because of speed demon and then once I get around 40 or so waters I sell the extra 20
---
On Super Duper mart bot three different server inventories in a row just now, haha
---
In every game people will take advantage of exploits. If it’s Bethesda’s fault, then you can blame every other dev in the world for having bugs in their games
---
Care to share please?  I still can't find it.
---
That's why I ask for other people's prices first. If it's reasonable, I cut it slightly. IMMORTALP74 
---
A campaign to start supporting non dupers?   I'd rather pay more from some one who isn't duping than get a bargain on one of someones thousands of duplicated items.

Someone clearly doesn’t understand how game design works

it's against eBay tos to sell digital goods.

So you can pay money to skip most of the content of the game you bought with money?

I built my land in the middle of nowhere and i have no foundation walls or roof. I just spread out everything
---
Woo 73! Did you get there solo or with other players? Did you follow the overseer quests or just wander? Thanks for the kind offer, I really want to enjoy the game more and am happy to hear of options to escape or take a breather in lieu of a pause button. 
---
Unfortunately you can with peripherals like a cronus max.
---
I love playing with girl gamers on FO76! They make sure you're ready to fight (full health, well fed, no rads, not thirsty, have ammo, etc.) and are some of the most responsive teammates when in need. I love the shit talking and testosterone that comes with all male teams, but sometimes it's nice to relax!
---
I’ve tried fast traveling there, traveling near there and walking there, and having lower level friends do the same.  None of us can seemingly get it to trigger.   
---
I’ve wondered if it’s been relegated to a one off event. 
---
Glad you didn't listen to the advice and got the game, you play the same way I do from the sounds of it (and though my wife doesn't always like how slow I take it, she readily admits that my style has advantages over her less patient methods in the Fallout and Elder Scroll games =).  As long as you are enjoying the game and progressing, there is no wrong way to play it (despite the opinion of your ex-boyfriends =).  Hopefully you find someone in time that properly appreciates the value of your playstyle. =)
---
I don't mind!
---
Although the weapon is not a legendary, it is a bit upgrade. I got rifleman expert rifleman and master rifle each at 1 star and speed demon and marsupial. I'll send pics...in like 5 hours... :(
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
no reboot needed if you change all the legendary weapon/armor prefix item coding.
---
all that duped armor and stuff gone
---
thanks bud !
---
It makes you a selfish asshole because it ruins everyone else's ability to play and they are actually present while you aren't.
---
Yeaaaaaaaaaah
---
Facts. Level 135 here, and I don't mind selling stuff dirt cheap. I'll even repair equipment for cheap. Caps aren't ridiculously difficult to come across, and don't have much use until a legit player market is utilized. 
---
But what if we scrap the mod that prevents us from scrapping mods before it can stop it?
---
(On a more serious note, this sounds great.  Has it worked well for you so far?)
---
Yeha i did my best
---
ahah yes kinda I agree
---
&gt;They're clearly not in full control of the game
---
Lol you can say that again
---
Because it's a POORLY MADE GAME! I seriously don't get how it's not getting through your heads.

Check wheel barrels they have giant packs

Ah, wrong system mate

wow thanks you !

I agree and for those who argue it’s punishing the player base answer this, in what mmo or online multiplayer game where you need and store mats, guns, armor and everything else can you do it in an unlimited amount? Also using an alt is a mule isn’t a relevant argument, I wasn’t aware Bethesda made this readily available to the player? 
---
Almost, but I didn't !
---
Exactly: “who gives a flying fuck about her dating life?” If her post was just her last 3 sentences, I’d upvote and move on. But I don’t give a shit about her shitty relationships or her need to feel good about her girl power and “take that ex-bfs” bullshit. Save that shit for her feminist studies class. And quite frankly, it feels like the game is background noise, and her only point was to complain about her relationships and brag about feeling good about “one-upping” her exes. So the karma-mining just makes me hope she loses interest in the game. 
---
I must have gotten lucky then, my daisycutter had mirv on it already. Be careful though, it's very sensitive when it comes to aiming. I've nuked myself quite a few times, which isn't too big of a deal because I always use PA. 
---
Oh shiny
---
Top of the Monorail Elevator has several bags.
---
Okay. White Springs was one of the only places that caused me anxiety. Pretty sure that's the biggest ghoul mob in the game. 
---
Good post! I literally just learned what TSE even means.
---
I know the shotgun perks surely help, but do the explosive perk cards make the weapon even more powerful? 
---
Destroy them all with a beacon!
---
epic 
---
Shotguns only give you an extra pellet. Your listed damage isn’t the same thing as the actual damage.
---
Do you know, number wise, how many there may be?
---
The big green bridge has a truck with a few bags of cement around it
---
Ok

Check this [page](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Intelligence) for intelligence and browse to get to other SPECIALs. The only source i could find that goes into detail
---
Look in the blackwater mines, the big room with the uranium ectractor, on the catwalk should  be  like 4 bags, each giving you 7 concrete iirc
---
Where do you get marine wetsuit mods? I like the look of the marine wetsuit but I only have mods for vaultsuit.
---
A great story to read. Jw any of you play as stealth or assassins?

It's that big gas prices sign that was outside the Red Rocket in FO4.

Lol what?  It’s in like a lot of workshops.  Just go spend the 25 caps and farm to your hearts content.
---
Only option.
---
Maybe the neon letters that you can place in your camp.
---
I agree!
---
A big ol’ has station sign 
---
Complete with a few numbers and letters still on it!
---
It wasn't fixed, I accidentally had it happen a few days ago, my stored budget was like 180%
---
Yep, majorly. 100% more explosive damage and you can up the radius
---
Keith, because the name's so menacing.... "Look out everyone! Here comes Keith!!"
---
Epic well done.
---
Look near the water pumps between the service station and the tents with the ghouls in Flatwoods.  There's bags around there.
---
Like a clitoris
---
And your the end all around here huh?
---
Welcome to the party. What system you on? 
---
I'm not certain, there's Grape and Dark at least. I think there's one more but I'd have to check.
---
Most of Endurance perks are complete trash. 
---
Nice, I know that BOS heavy combat chest gives you 86 dr and I think er too. Im on xbox.
---
In fo4, I dont think BOS really did anything, but in 76 BOS is basically the 4th tier of armor material.
---
When I get back ill see if I can fill in any blanks
---
I say you should wait a bit till some things are fixed. Other than that, the game is pretty good. 
---
Hell yeah! Games are there to enjoy no matter how you play, or how "good" you might be as long as you're having fun, to hell with what anyone else tries to say!
---
I think if you just hold down options when the invite comes through you'll auto join the group as well
---
Yep..this one is going into my cringe compilation
---
Way to go! I never rush through Elder Scrolls or Fallout games. I'm afraid I'll miss the little details if I rush through areas without looking in every damn corner.
---
Just as a little tip, the points you have in Luck, the more often you’ll find things that you’ve tagged for search in containers. I got over 80 screws from playing for about 6 hours yesterday, and my luck is at 6 or 7 I think. 
---
Breath...
---
WTH happened to this sub?
---
Pannapictagraphist
---
No. Wait 6-8 months. Price will come down to $10 or less, and hopefully a lot of stuff will be fixed. Currently it is BY FAR the buggiest  game I played in recent memory. And by that I mean I cannot recall a single game that had quite so many obvious bugs.
---
this needs to have much more attention than it currently has
---
I'm on PS4.
---
Did you take him back to your camp?
---
When I'm next on we should game! 
---
Ah don't worry about it, I now have 7 variants I think, thought you might have known off the top of your head, thank you.
---
I don't mind anyone doing that.  I had multiple characters in the Borderlands games because I kept everything on those mules.  I'd do it in Fallout as well if I could.  I hate getting rid of something I might need down the road.
---
I personally say it is a very good game, though sometime being buggy. In my opinion I would, plus if you play on Xbox you get a additional 500 atoms, just throwing that out :)
---
Our composition are 4 Super Mutants.

Lots of fun!

Speed demon mutation and any perks that help reload speed.
---
It's used because it's very cheap, since they need to craft 255+ of it
---
Unfortunately this is a cash grab. They don’t care. I know, unpopular opinion
---
No human NPC's is jarring at first, but you grow accustomed to it very quickly. In fact it's almost relieving not having them there, and you get the story on your own terms. I wouldn't want this in *every* game, but in this particular one it work nicely. 
---
Been searching for powered doors since launch never seen them for sale.  Stopped Graham 7 times so far, no joy.  I got the switches with the barn set.  I bought 2 of them as per a YouTube video and it seemed to work.  Got them from Harper's Ferry.
---
You need to edit the names of the duper’s so they can be called out, also make sure to report them to Bethesda.net
---
I love how every day, someone has had enough and decides to write a book about all the Pros and Cons of the game. We don't care. We know all the good and bad. You aren't saying ANYTHING that hasn't been said over and over. It's been posted 1000 times. The game has so many problems, you might as well just move on to something else until this gets completely remastered or withers and dies.
---
Yep. Just use the mac version of autohotkey. That combined with my hundreds of thousands of nuka cola and lead belly level 3 mean I can be back up at 25000 caps immediately.
---
Such bullshit.

Cool.  My PSN is ratandjmt

Sounds like you made the best kill by breaking up with him. I tease my wife by saying more dps or more dots but I would never tell her she is a shot gamer girl

You ladies sound like your having a great time. I am starting an assassin guild so I'd be glad to help penguin or any of you to optimize your characters, if interested.

My laptop has a 950 gtx and an i5 and I think I only had troubles once in 170 hours. Stop visiting shady websites.

&gt;Please don't tell me "it's not easy to fix X" blah blah blah. I know.. I've been a game devooper for 23 years.

Banning dupers is an easy start. Should be pretty easy to do. Database query for anyone with +100,000 of any item and ban. Seems pretty simple to me.

No but it is possible to google these questions or even just search for the answer in this sub where it has been asked many times before.

Man I love that power armor. So fucking cool looking.
---
Knew this one 👍
---
No problem.  As mentioned  I bought both sets at the same time early in my CAMP building as I was/am made for F4.  Good luck searching.
---
That's just me. I'm standing next to a mountain, chopping it down with the edge of my hand.
---
I have the exact same problem and have NEVER duped.  I wouldn’t even know how.  I feel ya!  It’s so frustrating when you get errors from just using your stupid stash.  And, def ignore the toxic comments from others.  Let’s hope Bethesda gets their poop in a group and fixes the issue. . Soon!!  
---
They sell it for real money bro.  They are getting paid and dont care about the end game.
---
Ty
---
Bethesda needs to put unique ID’s on in game items to make each one trackable. Another game I played had an early game dupe issue that everyone was abusing and eventually all duplicates got deleted regardless of who’s possession it was in. If you paid in game currency for it, it was gone anyway. It’s a tough stance but it’s the only way to combat duping I’d try can’t prevent it in the first place. 
---
I’ve stopped trying to trade with people for this reason. If I get it myself the item carries more value to me and I know it isn’t a duped item. 
---
How is it so many fell for this obvious karma farming bs?
---
So you may as well blame companies like rockstar, Ubisoft, etc
---
Np sweetie ;)
---
Im a guy and always go for the stealth/sneak characters. Its my favourite way to play and explore. It doesnt mean you're not good. It means you have a more processed, more thought out approach to how you tackle problems. It actually shows some maturity and intelligence in your approach, not rushing in head on. Thats also not to say that those who do are dumb. Im just saying, good on you. Fuck them. Be proud of how you play.
---
To be fair, it seems like a little bit of everything is causing game crashes. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
An Instigating Gauss Rifle is not crap though. Neither were the Furious Tesla Rifle or Furious Gatling Laser I saw at the same time.
---
I mean his source is probably that, when it was on the store, it said "Limited! 1 day!"
---
Source: I saw it on the store, and it said "1 day."
---
It happens specifically at that POI. There are notes and Holotapes there if you want to get the backstory of why. I won't spoil it. 
---
Read the lore more around the area
---
Added just shoot me a message when you get on. 
---
It sounds like you and I play with the exact same style. It keeps the game fun for a longer period of time for me. Finding the little details all over the map. You're better off without them, they sound like trash people and I'd say "people" is a generous assumption. Fuck'em.
---
I can't seem to find you, group invite?
---
Torture with a clamp or clamplike device?
---
That’s what I was looking for. So in the case of Intelligence: Crafting and Scrapping. Everything else is based on the perks. Thank you!
---
Unfortunately I don’t have the ability to craft legendary items so the INT level won’t help me there much.  
---
I'm just gonna throw out there I'm level 60 almost and haven't killed one solo yet so good on ya :-)
---
Why would they dupe a board?!
---
You don't need a console nor the game nor a connection. Just watch any goldfarmer documentary.
---
How did u get that little „raider“ sign next to your name •.•
---
Nice try. 
---
That was oddly defensive 
---
There are bags all over... For real. 
---
There is the crazy cat lady house near Morgantown HS. Should be a post you can search for for the location. 
---
If you wanna report someone, report Bethesda, for making this an online game
---
I got a two star weightless heavy combat armor chest with + endurance. Whatchu got?
---
Imagine being so miserable you make fun of people for how they play games to make your life feel worthwhile. 
---
Been there about 30 times. 
---
Happened to me as well in a cabin there yesterday when i was looking for clues about the flatwoods monster (holo in the hotdog place just down road). 
---
Pretty sure its got something to do with the reports of space craft / aliens as i left the server went back on another one and the rumbling started again. Only in that one cabin though none of the others. Didn't see anything or find the damn monster but my pad was going hell for leather when i was in that cabin...pretty sure i lost 45 mins as well (jk) 
---
The holo mentions the guy being abducted was drunk but he says that the monster made him drunk so i was thinking about going back there once i'd stocked up on alcohol and see if that made a difference.
---
They will, if you sometimes got glitches that [gives more ammo than intended on your rifle.](https://imgur.com/a/sAfjK0Q)
---
No because of the xp farm at the golf course will be filled up and servers are unstable 
---
Claim Sunshine Meadows and deploy a concrete extractor.
---
There are occasional rumbles all around the ash heap, but I've experienced a major quake near mt. Blair and on one of the mtns in the forest.
---
Actually what they could do is you can’t even do slap damage inside at all. 
---
I haven't found the 4 INT to help that much for crafting.
---
Ah I figured that maybe the analogue stick was a little loose. Not likely to be the problem if it's the same on multiple controllers tho.
---
Super easy start. Account aquired items that aren't available in game. Remove items and or ban account. It's nutty how little is being done and how brasen they're getting. You can go on the market place and find posts with people explicitly cstating they're selling duped items
---
I never played any of the othet fallouts... With that said this game is amazing. Ive been hooked since day 1. 
---
I’ve seen people become more pleasant towards the game as time goes on. For example, the subreddit is a lot more positive than it used to be. So the growing accustomed thing makes sense.
---
A month late here, but try the event in watoga high school, tons of xp, tons of useless stuff, but I got mine from finishing the event.
---
Don't just run around telling everyone!
---
Just take over the Workshop in Bogtown for a little bit. it has concrete. I used it for a while when I wanted to switch my camp from wood to brick.
---
Any peripherial that lets you play with m/k on consoles lets you using macros as well. You can just put macros on most of the mouse/keyboard itself. 
---
There is no fix for that problem as ppls are using things like Cronus max not for macros but to play on ps4 with X1 elite controller or on X1 with ps4 controller.
---
This. Gorge Junkyard. Right in front of the workshop. You can do junk and black titanium extractors while you’re at it. 
---
THIS I NEED TO KNOW!!!
---
What is the white paint PA called and where do I get it?'
---
I assume we are talking hypothetical since you couldn't seperate Whitesprings from the rest of the server do to storyline and game progression issues. 
---
That being said, it would be kind of fun to have that sort of end game farming/trading hub for players. Maybe once the DLC starts getting released some of these features will be addressed. Confirmation that vault 94 will be DLC is exciting because they have a really great opportunity to give the player base an official player hub.
---
Do you think a player hub would be beneficial or are you more interested in seeing Whitesprings in general exist as the player hub?
---
Turrets need to have longer engagement ranges. I've watched a lvl 5 supermutant with a hunting rifle whittle down my rocket turret from 50 meters and the turret won't shoot back. It will only engage enemies within 15 meters of my base. 
---
Ah, I gotcha. I like your methodology. See you when you get to china!
---
I remember reading a post a while back where a player crashed after digging up 15 treasures in a row. He claimed it crashed the server, I guess the only way he could know that if he was teamed up and they all dropped, but I dont know, im not convinced.
---
It is possible to trade ammo for CAPS to other players but not vendors.  I have sold .50, .45, 5.56 to one player(s) who then sold me Shotgun.  We traded 1Cap per round.  I drop ammo I don't want where other players can find it, and give 308, .38 free to new players leaving the vault.  
---
90 reduced weight, Gain health when hitting, and 40% better power attacks? Just making sure, cause I don’t know any German and just going off the numbers.
---
Marsupial adds super jump and +20 carry weight, costs -4 Intelligence. It pairs very, very well with jet packs. 
---
Darg. I play video games to avoid reading ...
---
if your on PS4 how much
---
Yes correct, the Heavy Combat Armor base DR is 61 + the BOS Mod 25 = 86
---
They 100% use them for macros. Also your device needs on board memory for it to retain macros when connected to a console.
---
As for the power armor mods, you can't get them from scrapping. Either have to find the plan or the mod
---
Seven years old really? Maybe start with Mario? 😂
---
And despite having such a small amount of time and no help from bethesda at all it is still better than any other bethesda game I can think of
---
Sexy
---
Sadly no. They left out a lot of basic pieces from Fallout 4.
---
Youre on PC right? Seems all the 'not meant to be aquired' gear is solely on PC, which leads me to believe its done using third party software. So glad im a console pleb tbh.
---
Enjoy and may the ammo come easy to craft!
---
I haven't reached the last mission yet, unfortunately, but it'll be good to have people to play with if I hit a particularly tough spot so thanks :D I'll be sending an invite out in a little bit! 
---
Keep killing it fam I believe in you!!!
---
Thank you kindly, pleasure doing business haha :)
---
Ugh, well thanks for the warning! 
---
Is this PC? I have a friend that collects these and he’d love to trade if so. (Since it’s red and 3*)
---
For melee solo runs i have hacking and picklock on and turn the turrets loose on the robots along with Robobrains in each section. Then just run thru the chaos. Good fun although some have reported frame rate drops. If that's case just deactivate em. Turrets are silent and ya can club the Robobrains while they on coffee break. Can do in 15-20 min or so. 
---
Sadly yes :(
---
Funny enough it's not the inventory or anything that causes the server lag 
---
it's actually the macro rapidly pressing X to create one item over and over on the bench
---
My friends and I tested this out 
---
You can lag out the entire server just with an Auto fire button at quick repeat speeds
---
Because of this,
---
we believe that everyone logged into the server has one database file string in Ram 
---
and every time you actually hit enter on a crafting bench, it updates that Master file,
---
Hitting that file rapidly enough lags out the entire game for everyone
---
This was also the same reason I believe the initial damage invincibility glitch occurred 
---
Rapid fire weapons would hit an enemy faster than it could be updated in the ram of the server from multiple players youd get the server lag and a target would be out of sync 
---
I would be happy if my other half had the same passion as me for games XD
---
Quite litterally ruined the game for me.
---
I just can't bring myself to play until this is fixed. Its so frustrating trying to explore the world and constantly get hangs or disconnects.
---
My bad, you had that. I only looked at the screenshot, which clipped the rest of it. (Saved this post to look at it in more detail later)
---
&gt;  It's nutty how little is being done and how brasen they're getting. 
---
It's shit like this that's going to make me put the game down. I haven't seen a game this overrun by people blatantly cheating outside of years-old games abandoned by their devs.
---
The in-game economy is probably FUBAR.
---
If you hold down the options button when the invite comes in it will show you who invited you and allow you to accept/decline the invite. Also if you check on the recent players list there will be a dot beside the name of the person who invited you. Clicking on their name will allow you to accept/decline the invitation
---
Yeah it’s pretty irresponsible. It’s rated 18+ for a reason and I mean I know that’s a little high but seven is ridiculously young to be seeing this shit imo
---
Gonna be adding you in a bit! I'm still super early in the game so I can't help out with anything high level at the moment, but once I gain several levels, it'd be fun to roll out and explore places :D 
---
I think I called you a liar. Sorry
---
Absolutely! Sending you an invite soon :) 
---
Why do girls say "girl gamers" so often as if being a girl and a gamer is some special category?  You don't see people calling themselves "1-legged gamers" or "straight-A highschool gamers".
---
Gamers range from trash  talking anyone playing a game in a way they find distasteful.  A certain % of people just generally feel the need to get after others for random crap that isn't their business.
---
I think your poor taste in men may be a more constructive connection to the problem to focus on.  "The 'shit' gamer with an evident preference for dating people who treat her badly finally kills a scorch beast, and after some honest reflection upon her string of recent experiences, has a better idea of what she really wants in a romantic partner, and now quickly identifies and avoids the red flags of yesterday's ex bf's".
---
This place is fantastic. It's like 50 plastic in a tiny shack.
---
I see you, sister 💜
---
It’s the apocalypse, anything goes
---
I built in the ash heap to avoid scorchbeasts.  Most of what attacks my base is under lvl 30.  Haven't seen my missile turrets or spotlights attack, though I now have a lvl 14 snallygaster pet/tame that defends the base better than the turrets.
---
Beth needs to fix this, then wipe.
---
I'll think on it, but thank you so much for the invite! Sounds like a lot of fun 
---
Curious as to how you confirm if a member is a female or not. Would imagine you would get a lot of men trying to join a female only group
---
Lvl 350, Pm me
---
Thats why I said most of the gaming mouse/keyboard. Every G Logitech, new Razer etc. has internal memory to store profiles and macros. 
---
You crash your own client, not the server. If the server crashed, it would prevent the dupe from working.
---
And no I don't dupe items, just watch YouTube videos to see how crazy the glitches are getting in the game
---
A healthier experience than fort nite
---
The costume is a little different though but I tend to agree with you. 
---
BTW, if you did not find the witch hat plan I have an extra one now. 
---
This would work if only the building was a separate server and you just walk through the door into a separate server. The only issue would be long loading screens.
---
I love exploring other's bases. People are so creative! Please leave your door unlocked for me, I may leave you a goodie bag 
---
I only downvoted you because making blanket statements like this doesn't add anything to the conversation. Its not that its an unpopular opinion becuase a lot of players feel the way you do. However, this way of thining is largely based on feeling and less about facts. 
---
We don't really know what BGS is planning due to their lack of communication with the community. That doesnt make it a cash grab though. They could be woring and discussing ways to fix the issue behind closed doors. I just wish they were more open with the players to give us reassurance and prevent your line of thinking.
---
Morgan Town High School itself with the pumpkin baskets and golf balls can get you over 100 plastic on a good run.
---
See, once I figured out what that gong sound was that perk became useful in at least getting the magazine achievement.
---
I've had the one where you never get addicted to alcohol since very early and it is the only one I wish I could delete.
---
You need the Razer software on your PC to use the macros though, just saying. I have a Naga and a Deathadder and neither retain macros.
---

I don't know how people are getting away with selling skins. That's crazy. 
---
My wife won't even pick up the controller lol. Good for you. 
---
It's linked to "spamming" and triggering it more times then you have maps to dig, one of those things Bethesda didn't account for..
---
We will be careful
---
&gt; I've also had legendaries and other mobs just stand up then die when I'm near. The only loot to be had is meat, if any. 
---
Okay, I'm not the only one to experience this, it's weird.
---
Join a duper hunting party. Pretty fun. Been doing it with some dudes last few days. We find dupers an rain hell on them.
---
How about a button where I just get 2k experience and 8 golf outfits
---
Over a week? She really should get some rest!
---
Did know have gotten it yet.
---
They just added it, check the atom store.
---
Sounds like you're projecting. Don't worry, buddy. You'll kill your first scorchbeast one day. Maybe you'll be as good as OP too! Just keep working at it.
---
We'll described already, but I'll give a specific example from an old game because functionally it works the same and the mechanics we're more up front then. The original Pokemon.
---
Two players want to duplicate a Pokemon. So they start by going to the trade room in the game and connect their Gameboys with a link cable.
---
Player A brings in a lvl 100 Pokemon named god. 
---
Player B brings in a lvl 1 Pokemon named sacrifice.
---
When the enter the trade room the game prompts both players to save.
---
Players a and b trade god for sacrifice. Player A now has sacrifice, and turns off his Gameboy.
---
Player B exits the trade room with god and is prompted to save.
---
Player A was never prompted to save after the trade so he still have god when he turned his game back on.
---
Isn't that the new paint in the Atom shop?
---
The duper did it wrong. He's supposed to hold onto the boards 
---
You shouldn't have even blocked their name. Or maybe send the unblocked screen grab to whoever cares on Bethesda's end. 
---
*in the voice of Earl Lemongrab* 
---
This.... This is unacceptable!!!!! 
---
You can use it to break down ore into scrap
---
When I was building mine, I snagged the gorge junkyard for ore (and the junk extractor).  And explored for the springs ect. 
---
This topic is the smelliest dead dog there is on Reddit and people still just keep trying to beat it to death and flood all of our feeds with it.
---
Here’s an award for being the 9,735,642th kid to soapbox this issue.
---
Seems to me the OP was complaining about the drops since he/she got ammo and nothing else than proceeded to ragequit. Im not sure where in the op post they mentioned bugs or glitches, since thats what I was replying to.
---
Yeah, on the west third of the map, prettymuch.
---
Or if you set up your stuff inside an existing building. Most of them are pretty safe.
---
As freestanding camps out in the open in Scorchbeast territory go, best bet is rocket turrets and hoping they decide to hover in place (or make the rare landing)
---
That’s insane! If you shot something at point blank would it damage you as well??? 
---
Its a safe way to play. I do it too. Sneak around, scavenge and choose my fights wisely. It conserves resources.
---
This is a know issue, and why were you recording yourself bulking unless you were trying to crash the server?
---
OK, and? 
---
&gt;not impressive
---
&gt;six levels above
---
Am I missing something
---
Bos watoga vendor.. I see it all the time. 
---
The fuck is wrong with your ex’s, when I help people play I don’t tell them what they’re doing right or wrong I mostly just point them in the direction of things that would help or the bosses or something.
---
The hate isn't because they tried something different, it's because they released A bug ridden mess with poor server stability. While knowing they had poor server stability , they didn't give an off-line option.
---
Ahh i see
---
Apology accepted.  Now let's kiss.
---
Carrying massive quantities of items isn't what's causing server instability, at least not in my experience. I went to buy a TSE gun from someone found in Xbox Looking for Group, and the guy had 5+ million of every TSE weapon, Nuka's, every single bulked junk, and every serum, and yet I experienced no lag at all when in the trade window. I don't condone duping because it wrecks the economy of the game, however I don't think it is the ultimate cause of the instability issues.
---
My wife and I have been the last few people left in a server late at night and tried trading her some ammo, and it would say trade failed sever times before going through. I think the issue is something inherent with trading, some bug within the trading window itself, regardless of inventory amounts.
---
Thanks for this, not sure why I didnt think of it. :)
---
Try building somewhere else. Played since launch and never had a scorchbeasts at my camp. My current camp is between whitespring and watoga at the top of the mountain at the junk node location and I don't get scorchbeasts there. Moved there the day of the Dec 11 patch.
---
If you play on xbox, I'd love to play! I'm also a girl, mid 20's and super friendly always looking for other ladies to game with! My gamertag is Eatsleeprave281 
---
You're welcome! :) 
---
Because he is believed to be a duper by some 30 plus people. He very well may not be, but he hasn't responded, sooo...maybe he is guilty and doesnt want to reply to the people calling him out.
---
If your on Xbox one, just goto manage storage transfer to ssd.  It doesn’t take long or erase any progress. 
---
No you are wrong on every level. The stairs are meant to be stacked. Just cause there is a bug prevent this purpose doesn't mean it's an exploit. It's called a work around. /Checkmatefail
---
Awesome stuff. I play the same way tho I'm lucky to have a bf who will keep pace with me. He still is a rush into combat guy i just hang back and pick things off . I am just lvl. 22 right now but I'm having a great time in fallout. 
---
Just launched another if you want to join :)
---
Only option I found is the pack up and move your base to start fresh.
---
Yea. It’s about 18 dupes based on exponential math if you start with one. Only takes one minute to dupe.
---
This needs more visibility. I have the exact same problem and can't continue the main questline because of it.  
---
I'm calling /u/LoneVaultWanderer, this needs to be one of the top priorities!
---
How did you get that paint job??
---
oops, should have clarified, I am on PC
---
Desynced maybe? Which would mean it's dead, but your client had a packet lost with the server and thinks hes still alive. (simplified explanation). 
---
Unless it was still actively doing damage to do you/your camp.
---
Yes.
---
THANK YOU!!! :D
---
How do you prove duping?
---
How do you keep this from being abused?
---
How do you keep this from turning into mob justice / have vs have nots?
---
sounds like a shitty bf you're better off without 
---
You know. It's not been out particularly long and frankly the developers are allowed to take the holiday time off. They are fixing issues and developing more awesome content so just have a little patients.  It's no quick process to do this!
---
They said content updates in 2019
---
Never, it's kinda like you have double what you see cause the 50% less damage
---
I want to just plug a bunch in at once and watch the world burn. I have an ungodly amount myself. Can u just summon them back to back? 
---
It’s the cause of most of my deaths
---
He’s beat Super Mario Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, Bendy and The Ink Machine, and some others lol
---
That's a god roll for sure
---
Hmmm. Yeah not sure for PC.  Sorry!
---
My girl is a gamer she is celebrating level 100 today she's a damn pro she can almost beat me and that is saying something lol I've been good at video games for over 2 decades.. I've also been a pro fallout player for just about as long... If my girl had my experience I'd be too embarrassed to play getting carried around by a girl hahahahaha
---
I have a Deathclaw Gauntlet in my STASH I never really use anymore, if you want I can sell it to you when I’m able to get on.
---
Nvidia thing, able to save the last 20 minutes of game play. 
---
ItS ThE DuPeRs
---
Either way, thank you for the info 
---
This post is everything! I'm so happy you said to hell with it and just bought the game. I've had boyfriends that are weird about gaming as well. I'm sure you'll find someone who is awesome supportive! Until then keep kicking butt in fo76. 
---
Oh come on can we not just go in the middle? Does on or the other always need to be the “lame” way to play a game?
---
It’s incredibly fun popping a jet and a psycho and wrecking people.
---
Yes this is a very valid duper strategy. Right, my guy?
---
Great thanks so much for testing that out for me! Appreciate your help bud.
---
Ya it was still destroying stuff in my base
---
I like this a lot. It really has a post modern darkness to it, whatever that means my brain just thought of it haha
---
Heck is pay / trade well for it, (PC) fantastic Raidery weapon!
---
Eh? Do you even play this game? You can't use a lvl 50 legendary until...wait for it...level 50. At which point you've definitely done almost all of the content unless you suck.
---
Back off mister, I've been waiting on the next Elder Scrolls for forever!
---
No worries!
---
I actually found the 4th one (the car park one) first, so it was a bit of fun to find out what the hell it was all about once I got inside. 
---
Look a hater of 76
---
My wife and I are the same with 76. We're just enjoying exploring the wasteland together instead of by our lonesome. 
---
Very much so. If they are too close you easily blow yourself up. Also, power armor can be crumpled bc of the crazy damage, so be careful. 
---
Marsupial helps bc you can jump and shoot at the ground.
---
Exactly! Good someone got the reference! Haha
---
if they had duping issues because they shoehorned multiplayer into an engine not designed for it, then yeah
---
Beseech is such a beautiful word. Needs used more often imho
---
Totally agree. I’m happy with my pre-order. The only other game I play besides FO76 is PUBG. 
---
Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment with bugs or maybe putting up with PUBG bugs for over a year has made me not notice bugs in FO76. 
---
I love FO76 and excited to see what else they have in store. 
---
From everything other people have been sharing yes, it counts as a two handed melee weapon.  I haven't yet played with it so I can't 100% confirm this is true from personal experience but enough folks have shared their Mr Handy builds that I believe it.
---
Same thing happened to me! I scrapped everything in storage, but the budget still said 100%. The only option was to move my camp and rebuild it. Very frustrating since I had a hard time placing items the first time. The game only let me put my house in one very specific location. It took almost 20 minutes to get it back up in the same spot, but it solved the problem. So for now, the work around is to move your base and rebuild it.
---
The dupes are known for way longer (partially since beta) and Bethesda even applied a "fix"(which did literally nothing) during the 18th/19th december patch.
---
On the other side, these problems don't seem to be something you can fix easily. The worst offender (atleast in the way how it affects server performance) exists because of the way how characters and the map are saved, something that would probably take a lot of work to change without breaking more stuff.
---
I used to play as a hardcore trader and can tell you the answer is definitely yes! Everyone has a favourite weapon and so they're always on the hunt for a specific type because you can't ever have too much of your most used ammo type. 
---
For example, I will always pay good money for grenade launcher ammo and frags. 
---
You have to be a bit clever and put some effort in for best results. Message people in your game, ask them if they use the ammo you want to sell, then offer them a price that's much better than the vendors (not hard as vendors are a rip). You can only charge less that 1 cap per round to players you feel you can trust because to sell for less than a single cap per round you'll have to give them a certain amount at one price, then complete the transaction with a second installment sold for nothing. If that doesn't make sense I'll clear it up, so let me know. 
---
For the reason above, its easiest to sell ammo that most players will think is worth more than 1 cap per round. Laser ammo, missiles, 50 cal balls and other powerful / rare rounds are usually most sellable. 
---
Hope this helps! 
---
I found a drop bag filled to the brim with 20,000+ of every bulk junk item, i kept it and am now the craftsman who repairs weapons, armor and anything else free.
---
Get like 8 guys together and have one trade with them then have everyone else just open fire with the strongest guns you have. Hopefully you are able to get a good bit of health off him before he leaves
---
Well, crap.
---
The point of nukes is to kill the scorched beasts.
---
Story wise you are not just randomly nuking west Virginia you are doing the last resort option to try and stop a plague.
---
Thanks for the down votes,  guys,  I was being sarcastic lol.  NeXt TiMe i'Ll tYpE lIkE tHiS.  My bad.  ;)
---
U do u. Idc
---
Plenty time remaining on this year to deliver that promise!
---
No, its saved to your profile 
---
Those're usually Deathclaws. Not sure if its their spawn in or using their ranged attack, but they do make a very earthquakey rumble.
---
I swear he could take on the Scorchbeast Queen by himself and come out without a scratch or a dent.
---
Fuck that. I'm just happy my wife games. I only give her advice when she asks. 
---
Yes it does, all unarmed weapons benefit from this mutation.
---
Crap alarm if it doesn't shoot, and why have a 6+ options if it is only an alarm.
---
And people are gonna recieve shit from people who get disconnected from the server just so some asshat can get 90k of each bobblehead and TSE weapon in the game. So don't expect people to not get mad. 
---
Seriously the exploiters are the Raiders of this game I wish Bethesda would allow us to report them then once its proven put a delicious bounty on their heads for 24 hours and make pvp (incoming) always on and let us go to town killing them again and again until they no longer get anything from logging in.
---
I think it would be cool if in a DLC you could rent a room/suite on the top floor.  But I think the rest needs to be as is.  Maybe there could be some story threads about previous guests to make it busier.  But with it being a Nuke favourite and already connected to the bunker as well as the shops it serves it's purpose I think.
---
I would rather see an extra hub added out with the existing map.  Maybe to the West of the map where it is less polluted.  Storyline - The people or what was left of them moved West out of Scorched range perhaps.  Maybe quests to help reestablish some human NPC's much later in the game.  But I will likely be happy with any addition.
---
&gt;I'm not a little kid 
---
&gt;420 👍 
---
I'm getting mixed messages here
---
Breathe*?
---
LOL The game hasn’t even been out that long.  Holy shit, people.
---
r/upvotedbecausegirl
---
Ha, awesome.
---
I'm sure they can just clear an inventory of everybody who has crazy amounts of stuff.
---
I WANNA BE YOUR DOG.... I WANNA BE YOUR DOG.... ARF 
---
Ahhh I always disable all those unneeded background things, but can see the usefulness.
---
Short of long, widely know issue, "spam crafting" is bad for everyone, Bethesda knows about it and promises a fix sometime 
---
Spotlight massively increase the ability to Shotgun turrets.
---
Without a spot, the shotty has a short sight range.  With a spotlight between two of them, they rip up everything in sight.  No, they' don't seem to help Machinegun turrets as much.
---
YMMV
---
I haven't played in about a week. Last time I played I was doing a daily mission that was taking quite a long time throughout Grafton, while also doing any other events that popped up around the area. The server crashed and I was so close to finishing the daily that I was annoyed enough to not jump back in. 
---
Today I decided to pick up the game again. My camp is down near the Ash Heap, so to keep from losing my caps and fast traveling back and forth, I just claim the the workshop to the west of Grafton as a kind of second base of operations. I had *just* finished building beds, instruments (I can't help but make extras for the wanders), and other necessities after the initial defend event. Spent a good 5-10 minutes getting dirty water from the awful pumps (since we can't use purified water for cooking 🙄) since I had run out of boiled, and was ready to do inventory management to finish the rest of my Grafton quests. Then BAM, server disconnect. 
---
/heavy sigh
---
Maybe I'll try again next week. 😔
---
I thought so. My room mates thought so too. Had the whole room laughing.
---
100% don't bother trying to find the loot concrete sacs and just go for a workshop that produces it. The junkyard straight northish of the Overseers camp, the food plant west of Flatwoods, or the Poseidon yard (though thats a little popular and sometimes contested) are two early ones.
---
You ate awesome, thanks!!
---
I am a little bitter about only being lvl 31.
---
And you're right, I recently encountered my first scorchbeast on my own, and it had its way with me in a way that perhaps has left me with my own scars that I need to address before I go commenting on others.  Thanks, bro
---
My instance was different the bear in front of the camera hat a chef hat on and a wooden spoon in hand
---
Thanks!!
---
I’m having problems even getting the game to load now. Played earlier with some crash issues. Anyone else having issues loading the game as well?
---
Suuuuper satisfying. Great that more people had some laughs at their expense, too!
---
I like to hide at peoples bases with a stealth boy and offer to sell them drugs
---
Thank you!!
---
It is illegal but not worth the legal fees to pursue. Being banned is very possible if they give a damn   
---
So I moved my camp earlier in trying to find a better spot (I failed) and noticed that all of my crops had been multiplied by 3.
---
Later on I was checking out fo76 on reddit and saw someone mention that stuff placed on the ground, like crops or turrets, will still copy when you move your camp.
---
Previously the camp would copy *all* of my buildings and stuff but it didn't do that this time.  The only turrets I had placed weren't directly on the ground so if that's why they didn't dupe then the info I read earlier might be accurate but I wasn't about to try and test it.
---
The fuck, dude, they don't wave a magic wand and content appears. 
---
Play however you want! Just as long as you have fun.
---
Does it actually make a difference? I've never noticed. It seems like they only land when they want to. 
---
That is the new paying that went on the market today,  hot rod paint is so good looking i must admit
---
Correct the lack of response in eight weeks is what really grinds my gears. They can even deter others from doing it with a stern warning about it.
---
That sounds... kinda foundation level fucked. 
---
Trading sub would work better. Also, thanks for supporting dupers.
---
I just mean let’s be real if you go all Luck in fo4 you don’t need like any chems because you’re ridiculously OP to begin with. 
---
Ya get server issues and crashes.  Xbox here
---
Nice, thank you!
---
I think mirelurks are 100% gmo.
---
I’m only showing the hot rod station and hotter rod armor paints. The PA paints don’t seem to look like that tho 
---
I don't mind wandering with you helping out. I have a headset with mic so if you have any questions ask away. I'll be on shortly.
---
Fair enough, well if they know will remove it then
---
This is my finding, too.  A tall concrete in the line of usual approach gets all the attention.  And the worst that usually happens is a block or two gets knocked out.  Meantime, guns looking down at them shoot the enemy.
---
Dupers should be issued ONE warning. And their inventory forcibly cleared out on the backend.
---
If they do it again, ban them. Permanently. If its lagging the server for everyone, ban the people causing the problem. But also fix the damn glitch. Bethesda should be ashamed of this release. 
---
Your premise is partially false...
---
Unless it's a know duper it could be someone who horded technical data and got the paint jobs  through hours of quest hand ins..
---
These plans you can sell / trade..
---
The masks as I understand it are rare, but it's no different then the hunters long coat people are foolish enough to pay tens of thousands of caps for..
---
I agree duping needs to be punished, but you need to avoid the mob justice / mentality, because just because someone has something / can do something you can't / don't know about it doesn't make them a "duper" or "hacker"
---
I think I've put my finger on one flaw - there's a lack of choice in the game.  There's not much you can do regarding making things one way or another.  You complete events, kill things, explore, build, but there's never a "This or this action affects the server in this way" short of maybe a nuke zone.
---
These people are the absolute worst.
---
"Hey man, I'm about to go ruin my character, the server, and the economy. You want in on this action?"
---
And they always have this attitude like they are so cool for cheating their way to the top and expect people to shower them with accolades when really most of us have disdain for them and actively try to avoid them.
---
Bye.
---
Location please. I need to revamp my loading screen!
---
This damn five hour timer ;) 
---
You on PC? This sounds like the kind of thing that kind of maybe could have been me.
---
Pix plz.
---
Dang, I wonder why. 
---
Not even two months. People are ridiculous.
---
A month later is has millions of active players, LUL
---
That's it then maybe. My machine gun turrets utterly worthless, with or without spotlights. Haven't tried shotgun turrets yet though.
---
How these ppl not get banned? Infuriating! 
---
I did a bit earlier now I get lag and DCs
---
The problem is they haven’t fixed the problem. Most sales occur initially not 2 months after launch. They lost their opportunity. Even if they make fixes I doubt sales suddenly spike. Right now, I would imagine it’s do what we can to keep it functional and try and keep the current players, but I don’t see an all hands on deck diving catch 
---
My daughter was weaned on The Last of Us.  She's a killer, like her mother.
---
Flawed premise, again mob justice mentality.
---
I've played since beta, have two accounts, am level 294 through hard work and grinding and I think I have near a 500,000 loose steel scrap on a mule.
---
If you were actually a game developer for years you'd know this, because "mule account" have been staple of MMO's since "Ultima Online" 
---
I mean you can't buy it unless you're legal age...right?...so technically...
---
Heh
---
You did it!
---
Gauss isn't bad... but for the Tesla and Gatling would require special builds to use.
---
It does definitely. I tried to buy some ammo off of a some other player. He was going to scam me by Selling me 1 round then “drop the rest of the ammo and give it free” . I didn’t want to get scammed. Thank you sooo much!! :)
---
Could be xbox servers?  You Ohio based at all?
---
Doubt your scenario would ever happen. MTA are not that big a deal in 76 especially. 
---
I can agree 76 was a bit half assed though. If anything it should have been given a stronger, earlier beta, more community transperency with communication, and in general, a lot more thought into 76's development. 
---
That being said, I still love the game, after digging through the shit to get to the golden center, it shows a ton of promise. Despite the mistakes, and the fact i have to search for the good in this game alone, I still have some hope held out. Unlike you, how black and white your reply is to OP, I actually try to stay positive, and in the end, I can still enjoy the game for what it is. 
---
Usually check medical boxes, if not you can craft them. The plans for antibiotics are in the Enclave, while I’m not sure of you can craft disease cures without needing to find plans first but the forest version requires very little.
---
Nah I started with Resident Evil and Quake around that age and I turned out fine with no criminal record. :) 
---
Now I'm just really good at not becoming a sandwich and a master of lockpicking in every game.
---
Yo, I feel you! I'm also an avid gamer but I'm kind of shit at a lot of combat, so I use a lot of stealth and ranged weapons and usually do okay. Don't let anyone convince you that one way to play an video game is inherently 'better' than the other. My boyfriend loves to fuck around and explore while killing everything in sight, whereas I'm pretty liner and objective focused who avoids fights. We both love gaming and enjoy ourselves immensely. It's about enjoying yourself, not skill. 
---
No need to remove the post, just figured I'd share the info 
---
I always close my door, but I never lock it. I do this because of a bad experience I had in Fallout 4. I had a sliver of life left when I made it back to my settlement. I thought I was safe, but there was a Stingwing in my house! This has not happened in FO76, but I have come back to my camp several times while it was under attack. It's only a matter of time before one of the attackers decides to take refuge inside my house.
---
Nah, Colorado
---
Forcibly exiting the game without logging out (through task manager or game crash) will set the the charge of a fusion core to 100/100 charge if you are in power armor when it happens. So yeah a stack of 77 Fusion cores is totally doable, I currently have like 150+ waiting and hoping they up the durability of laser weapons so I can use my gatling laser for more than 5 seconds. =/
---
I had this for "leather left leg". I thought it would be legendary, as in skyrim these tended to lead you to magic items. Nope, it was a normal leather leg...
---
I was able to scrap it after logging out and back in.  
---
It’s an obvious glitch if you can’t see that then there’s no helping you, the queen is guaranteed to drop several plans and a weapon he’s angry that the there is a bug with the queen. Implying he’s angry about the loot table would mean the queen has the chance to only drop 8 ammo pieces which is not the case. OP has more than enough reason to be angry and he’s bringing attention to a glitch that many people encounter. Has absolutely nothing to do with the loot table.
---
I get them to land every time by only targeting the left wing in VATS (two clicks over from torso), and once crippled, it stays on the ground.
---
Do you offer mutations? I'm looking for twisted muscle and electrically grounded. 
---
I have no idea now dude. Maybe it was me that misread something. Next time I see some max level T-51, I'll compare again.
---
I've been tracking a few myself. At least one knows I am onto him, but hasn't tried to bribe me yet. I haven't said anything or reported them because it is much better to gather information &amp; make a strong case.
---
I think this is Bethesda's play here. They are waiting &amp; watching. The dupers believe they have free reign right now &amp; I think that is by design. They likely are logging these events that are causing outliers in the data &amp; will begin following up on it soon.
---
why?
---
I believe it's the actual duping process itself that messes up the servers, as those who do it need the instability to be able to complete the process. 
---
So you want to limit the enjoyment of others who maybe want to kill the queen with their friends because you might get angery. 
---
I doubt when you first attempted to kill the queen you where a particularly high level. 
---
There's story, and NPCs.
---
There are not dialogue trees and obviously no companion interactions, if thats your big interest. But yeah, there's plenty of story to be had lying about and told directly from audiologs or robots (a la System/Bioshock, or Subnautica). 
---
The background stories and worldbuild are all still there, and there is an impetus and story to keep you moving along main and side quests. You just aren't going to be the general of a large scale conflict between giant NPC factions in the way the other 3 recent FO games went (unless you get other players on board, and for that its gonna take them setting up persistent servers that cater to roleplay)
---
Items.. not scrap. And yes we all have mules. And I can prove I'm actually a dev who played MMO if you want.. but I don't think I need the self promotion in here.
---
No they made a shit game that’s worse than Skyrim 
---
This is why girls shouldn't play video games. Go to r/TwoXChromosomes with this fucking whiny shit. If I was a woman, I'd get offended by girls like you making me look bad, because you are a shit girl gamer. 
---
That's ur problem :^)
---
Finally got one Calibrated Shock after 10000 years
---
I guess I'm just used to seeing "diseased glowing x" so i thought that's where the rads came from. Thanks for the info. 
---
F\*\*\*ing great post.
---
Damn.  I was hoping they'd fixed it.
---
Sorry that you're experiencing such difficulties.
---
The vendor can't spawn there when you do
---
/agree x100.  Freakin annoying to swap in crafting perks, craft whatever needs to be, then swap them back out.  
---
Thank you! If only I could grab the weights as well :(
---
I hear you and I 100% agree. That's just how it is unfortunately. The alternative is to try and remove all pieces that could be touching the stairs/using it for support.
---
What you're saying, isn't wrong. I understand that completely, but without that context your original statement comes across as lacking constructional feedback. "Bad game is bad". Backing your comment up with your understanding like you just did, adds more to the conversation. Not trying to dis you or anything.
---
This is bullshit. People won’t stop, though. Bethesda has to come out with an effective patch to fix this.
---
Those stealth crits are no joke in fo76, it’s slow but effective.
---
I'm sad for those two douchebags and how much of the experience of taking your time to explore the universe of a videogame they're losing for just trying to prove a point and be the thoughest or something. Really stupid way of thinking.
---
Had 4 goes to do a Daily as kept crashing out. One of those go here then their.  Then twice buying/selling at Whitesprings, then at the start of a Nuke.  So I would say yes it has been worse today so far on XBOX.  Seems to have been messing up saves as well, I lost loads of scrap and Caps but got some Plans x 2!!!  So I went to CAMP and dreamed of tomorrow being a brighter day.
---
I would recommend getting it. I personally haven't found any game altering bugs and that is probably because I'm running it on a very powerful PC so if you have a good computer I would recommend getting it.
---
Yeah, I think this disscussion is good indicator that there is a lot to like about F76 but for each plus there are plenty of things that You woudn't expect from AAA studio that already has one of it's franchises turned into MMO (ESO).  
---
 
---
# Fallout 76 brings new meanings for old stuff
---
* **Junk** Yup, and IMO that exact thing defeats the purpose. I mean - You NEED to collect the stuff if you want to be up to date with your settlement and weapons. HUUGE balance patch for weight of each thing is requried. Also IMO a buff for legendary drops would be nice. 
---
* **Settlements** \- Yup, agree. Like I said  - I don't really like it. For me having your own place is really cool but simple room or house like in Skyrim is more than enough. Building your own settlement never really made sense for me in Fallout universe but hey - As long as it's optional - I'm fine with it. 
---
* **workshops**: Well I still think that idea might be good (or not;P there are pros and cons to workshops) but IMO you can easly grind the same resources just by playing/questing. So again - balance patch would be nice.
---
"yeah, i like to dream heh :p" - Nothing wrong with that, but see what the game is. Not what it's trying to be. At least that's my approach.   
---
* **NPCs** \-Yup, I'm almost sure they'll do that. There is way too mych backlash agains no NPCs. If I had to guess I'd say they will open one of the vaults in the DLC and allow either roam around it and meet NPCs or those NPCs will populate the Appalachia giving players new quests/vendors/lore.
---
* **rebuilding Appalachia**: IMO there is serious limitation with what they can do. The game is already out and it is what it is. It's survival light with a little taste of looter shooter. Guys like You and me might be interested in lore, quests and taking our time while exploring but VAST majority of players are doing daylies, going straight into nuke zones to collect loot and fighting in endgame. So they might add that I said when talking about NPCs. New quests where we help NPCs with doing quests etc. but I don't expect the game to change in such a way to give us proper reason/gameplay elements to rebuild Appalachia. It's sad but reality is... That it was more marketing line rather than promise of something more:/
---
Yup. Bethesda did plenty wrong with the game. It's unstable, it's hardly a deep RPG we expect from Fallout and even as looter shooter it's not the best. However I agree - There are plenty to like about the game. World/map is IMO one of the best from Bethesda. Feeling of Fallout is waaaaay better than goofy and shiny Fallout 4. You can actually feel danger when exploring mines for example. I love it!   
---
And unlike Destiny for example, it really is great to play solo. I just hope that it's gonna be kept in the future.  
---
So again - as a game? It's great for a spinoff and I'm having a blast, but I don't want F76 to be all there is. I want single player Fallout some day. 
---
Oh I agree that blast zones are fun and look great. That's why I said that simple change to radiation storms would be awesome. It's not gonna happen of course.
---
Well any change that would make them... scary... meaningful etc. would be nice. But firstly - As with rebuilding Appalachia - Very few people care about how nukes in F76 are terrible idea from lore/story perspective. For majority it's just a mean to obtain better loot. That's it. Secondly - Again, the game is what it is. Beth. might change/add some stuff but there is no way they gonna mess with what's already set in stone. And because nukes are right now the only endgame conent they are here to stay it this shape and form... Which is a shame.
---
I think the biggest issue is lack of communication from Beth on how lower levels joining changes the power of the queen. I had no idea that me taking a quick swing at one could make it so it was near impossible to kill. I only found out on here reading someone else’s rage on not being able to finish the death from above. I don’t think people are doing it on purpose by any means but not being able to finish would obviously be frustrating. Hopefully they find a way to fix it so higher levels can not loose out like that. 
---
Their all different the one in this picture is the t-45
---
There's another way to dupe if they ever fix the 300 item limit crash dupe.
---
Are you playing on a competitive team? WTF why are they yelling?? Video games are entertainment, are you enjoying these games? Then you're playing correctly.
---
I don't know the answer, but that is some nutty recoil, lol. Whats the fire rate when semi?
---
Ps4, been playing cor a couple of hours now, no lag or.disconnects so far.
---
Could be the exploiters having a field day yk
---
Hotter Tod power paints is correct though
---
This. There already exists a group who’s job it is to police dupers - Bethesda admins. Players should NOT be given this sort of power — it WILL be abused and the game would be terrible because of it. 
---
The issue is that the people who should be cracking down on duper’s just aren’t. This is the only thing that needs to be fixed. 
---
Good to know. I'll try that next time. 
---
Woooooooooooooooot!!
---
Resistance is Futile.
---
I started playing counter strike around that age. What a learning experience that was! And I'm not talking about the game lol
---
But you are still playing the game. So what if you aren't playing it the way other people want you to?
---
I love helping newbs, the part where people get angry is because people do the Silo mission, spend time in it, time in getting a keycard. Then waste xxxx amount of bullets for a mission impossible because some low levels are joining the fight. Thats why people get angry, and theres nothing to do about it right now.....
---
Omg where is this!!
---
Yeah don't ever buy one round, you did the right thing. If you need to buy, always ask the highest level players. Not only are most of them really interested in making sure lower level guys have a good experience, they've also had the most playing time. so have more ammo than they know what to do with. In 90% of cases, high level dudes with give you the ammo you want for free (caps usually mean less to them than other things). 
---
If you ever fancy getting into PvP and you play on Xbox one, send me a message. I arrange PvP games for those that don't know enough other players. 
---
Personally I like to go in guns blazing (I'm built for a total tank build) but like to explore and take my time ay the same time (Also fuck that dude)
---
There's another way to dupe also that isn't as popular once the 300 item limit to crash dupe is fixed (if it ever is).
---
My condolences. 
---
That’s the great think about games like fallout. They offer a multitude of play styles and experiences. But depending on the person in the gaming community you’re likely to get criticized. But good for you for standing up for yourself.
---
Ah, well that makes sense. 
---
Holy fucking shit that is pathetic xD
---
I've ran into the exact samr glitch for multiple times. Some of them are stuck underground and you can't attack or they can't been seen by VATS. But you might see that enemy's health bar and the [danger] status..... Hope they'll fix it soon.
---
Nope ps4
---
They literally announced plans to add vault  DLC last week 😂 
---
If you want to actually be informed before making a post like this , hop onto Bethesda’s ‘Inside the vault’ articles.
---
Usually when my weight is \~200 then I'll make it a point to take a free ride to my camp and dump them off.
---
Are you strangley drawn to typwriters? 
---
Not with the "slap" system. Unless they attack back damage is nerfed to almost nothing.
---
Harpers ferry near the vendor, other side of the wall where the Chem bench is, always has bags of concrete
---
I know that they dont do it on purpose, thats the problem. Make it make clear, or set minimum requirements. People responding here with Bye and other lame as comments have no idea how frustrating it is...
---
you haven't browsed the discord tied to this reddit page much then
---
You lucky ducky. I have a clip of how bad my lag was, i just need to learn how to export it from my xbox. 
---
https://youtu.be/vyhE3VUhfh0
---
I believe you're right. I'm pretty sure it's because people don't loot *everything* in the nuke zone. When I do whitesprings with a group, we all loot everything and drop what we don't need afterwards. We hardly have lag/server issues as long as there isn't a ton of others there as well. But once a couple low levels come by or people who just don't know, it all goes to shit. I assume it's because they're only concerned about picking up the legendary items and nothing else.. 
---
*Clean your meat piles, people*
---
I know what you're talking about, but I don't think this is it. I'm talking about rumbles that increase to a very large shaking and last for a good 20-30 seconds at least, not just the short roar of a deathclaw. Plus, you can hear rocks falling and the whole screen shakes
---
Haha you're better than me! I didn't kill my first scorch beast until level 58!
---
Why? How does duping worthless rap benefit a player? 
---
Good luck :)
---
I would probably say 2000 weight would be more appropriate because as a heavy weapons user I have to unequip all of those weight reduction perk cards in order to make use of the damage cards. When I do this I can easily be 1750 weight while I'm in a major fight... When I put the weight reduction cards back on I'm only like 400/465 weight... 
---
Lmao. There it is. Took you a while to get to the “doxxing”, which is the go-to for people like you. They didn’t doxx anyone ffs. It was an error and they corrected it and addressed it as required. 
---
If being a fanboy means that I decide if I enjoy a game rather than letting other people decide for me then so be it. At least I’m not a desperate little loser that wants so badly to fit in they jump onboard of a hate train for something they don’t even have any vested interest in. Someday, when you grow up, you’ll realize that people can like things you don’t and it’s ok. 
---
I wonder how much fuel it would take to fire a flames for 30 seconds
---
I got banned for making this exact post.
---
That's why I level every camp I see there.
---
&gt; I have near a 500,000 loose steel scrap on a mule.
---
&gt; 
---
Cool. When you have 500,000 bobbleheads, you're clearly a duper and should be banned.
---
I decided to go to Whitespring, tonight, to farm some ghouls.  Turns out, on my way there, someone NUKED it.   I get there and half the robots are dead.  But I joined a couple of others like me (lvl 40-50) and we hit the bloated, diseased glowing ones and ran a skirmish back to the resort, letting the robots finish them off.  
---
Got a double shot exploding gatling as loot.  F Yeah,  
---
Great times.
---
Right, it could be that, but I server hopped a lot today and had similar results. 
---
I bought one of those off some guy in our server.  It's really good even without shotgun perks
---
Yeah it's 1400 atoms but comes with paints for the T-45, T-51b, T-60, and X-01 all slightly different usually with a metallic chrome finish on some parts.
---
We should start a list of user names, anytime you trade with one of these people screen shot and then we can hand bethesda a list of people who need to have the account deleted/banned. 
---
Another point, you don't have to be good to have fun 
---
Tod, he's so hot!
---
Lmao
---
Get good and you can carry low levels 
---
We have twisted muscle. How you offering?
---
Alpine cabins are haunted my man , as some other commenter said , reading the lore would clear it up. 
---
Awesome job!!
---
My boyfriend stopped playing with me because I sucked at CoD. I was terrible at it ... I can't do shooter games. Then I got Sea of Theives because I wanted to play with him &amp; his friend, which he wouldn't do because he figured I'd suck at it.
---
Well SoT uses swords and melee weapons I'm pretty good at, plus I learned how to remap my controller to better suite my style. One day he looks over while I'm playing and for once while not being sarcastic, told me I was good! That I was playing better than he did! 
---
Now I'm playing 76; first multiplayer I've gotten purely for myself. I enjoy the exploring and taking in details. I focus on stealth and sneak attacks, and for playing it completely solo I'm happy with where I am :)
---
Luckily I didn't lose anything. I got an explosive assault rifle started to mod it and my game crashed. Scared the doodoo out of me, luckily it was stil there. 
---
I was level 45, had two shotgun turrets and a spotlight.  I was gonna move'em and stored them.  They took 31% of my budget.
---
So, watch out!!
---
 It was really bad on ps4 this morning
---
If the budget isn't an issue and you'd rather just have a passive supply of fertilizer(while small amounts) then sure it's worth it. I'm not entirely sure if you're able to have multiple but if so, I'd build two or three and you'd have a large amount coming in passively.
---
Personally, I just go around the map and get around 150 fertilizer whenever I run out and need to make mini nukes. My camp has to fend off radscorpions, radrats, mutants, etc so the turrets are needed for me haha.
---
Thats the biggest bullshit ive heard right now, we got prime on every weapon we use against scorch queen + perk cards maxed out, what else is there to do? 
---
I defend my entire base with these and a single basic turret! It also helps being in a low level area with you back against a cliff 
---
Things happen in waves and we will see what happens. I don't care if some slip through the cracks, there are plenty of people who have so blatantly chested that it's hard to ignore.
---
Alpine cabins has some stuff going on. Look around and read/listen to holotapes and terminals.
---
Field test. It does shoot normal cells and takes two trigger pulls to kill lvl 5 mutant. Thumbs down!
---
Play it your way. 
---
Good job for both defeating the scorchbeast and for standing up for yourself.
---
Do whatever you love and don't let other ppl talk shit about you.
---
I did this, but no piece was able to be removed. It seems if you set one of the stairs downwards on a concrete block it has a chance to lock up the entire construction.
---
Haha yep, sadly had to scrap it though... Wanted to make a guest house haha!
---
What exactly happens when low level characters join? Why does that make the fight harder? 
---
Screw them! Play how you play! Took me over 170 hours to launch my first nuke, no regrets XD
---
Yea working as intended I think. the blast zone seems to last for 2 or 2 1\2 hours and the spawns and fawna last 4. 
---
Thankfully I found out about this issue before I ever went to a nuke zone so I never made that mistake but if Beth isn’t going to put some safe guards in place then people need to keep reminding other players. Even if you flip your mic and tell them they are fucking up the kill. There will always be assholes but most people will leave and know better next time. You can’t avoid a mistake if you don’t know it’s a mistake to start with. I’m only level 40 so I haven’t dealt with this...yet
---
Flamethrower traps are pretty strong.
---
Thank for the info! Yep, this confirms that pistols are generally garbage due to the lack of any armor piercing perks in the game for them.
---
The ONLY thing they have going for them is that they have a low VATS cost. So... still garbage.
---
Cheers!
---
But outside of that 
---
Not offended at all. I still play the game. Based on their patches, they are just band aiding. The screen resolution was lazy, the latest hot fix was isolated to a single issue and their first fix a disaster. I would say, unless they think they can recoup their Dev time, we will continue to see lazy bandaids. 
---
Alot apparently. something is wrong with your build(s) 
---
Agreed , I’m down for restricting fast traveling to the Scorched earth event , but only if you haven’t discovered the area , if a low level player happens to have discovered FSP then that’s fair game. 
---
I didn't kill a scorchbeast unaided until lvl 60ish. It's not an easy task for sure!
---
Looks cool.
---
If I might offer a suggestion, how bout getting that hot rod power armor workshop item from the atomic shop? Think the flames would go well with your theme. 
---
Tell me how you do it, what is your build? Im curious now
---
Childish incels upset girls are playing with 'their' toys
---
I have been seeing this a lot. I am out of the loop. What the hell is a duper?
---
Who cares
---
I'd like to see them add ways to keep low levels out. Maybe make rads in nuke zones very hard to survive without level 50 PA and add level 50 Hazmat suits with really high rad resist. Just have the rad resist jump in a really substantial way that allows 50+ players able to survive in these zones.
---
bass fiddle is still a fiddle
---
But but... something something fanboys something something I get all of my opinions from other people on YouTube! How dare you enjoy something that I’ve been told I wouldn’t! How dare you I say!
---
they often dont have loot (some of them) 
---
Good good
---
Hopefully Bethesda can catch some of them selling stuff and sue them so they learn a lesson.
---
The whole point behind games is to play the way you want. Don’t know what the hell your ex’s were on about
---
omgz grllls
---
She gains resistance and hp based on the number of participants in the fight. If you tag her you're part of the fight and increase her difficulty. It isn't the biggest problem when they stay and help, but many times low and high level players just hit her and hide.
---
To eat up as much as much of your budget as possible.
---
The game mechanics are such that those low levels joining are actually the ones limiting others enjoyment as well as wasting their reaources. 
---
The cognitive dissonance required to admonish the OP for not wanting low levels to kill the Queen when their presence makes that a near impossibility indicates to me that you got water on the brain.
---
Not the only one...I kept staring at his weight limit trying to figure out how he was "200lbs over"
---
On a balcony at the back of the building, when it works well.
---
The advertisement for the excavator power armor has 2 extra lamps, I assumed that would be the bright mod. Good thing I googled before hand.
---
It became a profession back when WoW first came out. Gold farmers are found on all online games. They go anywhere people will pay real money.
---
Ooo they still drop loot. Don't lie to people.
---
I did! You're welcome!
---
actually yeah that has happened a few times in the last few days for me.  its just a memory or data leak right? that means its because of all the fucking cheaters? i might be wrong idk. 
---
Exactly, something like that.. Anything would help right now, end game isnt really exciting, with this problem is makes it even worse
---
At the medical section of the whitespring
---
I had a river base and I'd spawn inside the river trapped under a rock at time half way in and out of the map 
---
I found the plan for the hat and used it but couldn't find it in the armor workbench, I assume it would appear under "helmets" category there but nope.
---
When it comes to the costume itself, I don't mind to look for it myself for a little while longer. So far I found the plan for the skeleton costume while looking for it.
---
Huh.. so this is why a deathclaw was chilling at someones base.. neat
---
Now I'm playing 76; first multiplayer I've gotten purely for myself. I enjoy exploring and taking in the details. I focus on stealth and sneak attacks, and for playing it completely solo I'm happy with where I am :)
---
The idea with the mic is a good one, we already did that. But I think most people are in Party's, so they dont hear u :(
---
Welcome to Bethesda
---
I don’t understand the people who pay real money for these things. They are essentially turning the game into a pay to win situation. How is that at all fun? PvE becomes pointless and PvP  becomes a competition over who (stupidly) can spend the most money, not who has acquired the most skills.
---
Good story. Thanks for being good to kiddoes. My 9yo plays but he's not allowed to be on voicechat.
---
Also, those legendaries spawn there for everyone. One also spawns on the top floor of emergency services almost every time.
---
I imagine something thst would ruin the game for so many people and destdoy any economy the game could get would warrent a emergency patch.
---
The first good advice her actually, thanks! 
---
They definitely drop loot, just not for the owner. 
---
1.2 tonnes is 3k weight. Thats 60.5 tonnes lol
---
How do you communicate with other players? There's no chat system and even with voice on I've only heard a couple of local people speaking to me. And nobody has ever offered to trade. 
---
Your mom's night stand? 
---
I am terrified of gulpers.  I see them and run the other way.  Unless I can just port home hehehe. 
---
Exactly :( I love this game, I really do. Never made a negative thread about this game.. But this is just way too frustrating
---
So they're hitting her a couple of times hoping the high level players will do the work and they'll still get rewarded for "participation." 
---
That isn't the problem or the point of the post and you know it. It has become a thing where low and high level players will just tag the queen and hide. If they arent participating they shouldn't be there. 
---
Well thanks for that lol that's much worse.
---
I think your supposed to aim at the knee.
---
My best guess is it's intentional. That weapon spits out ammo that actually stays in the game visually. If I was a game designer, I'd defo try and make the auto version as funny/wildly unusable as possible to ensure that not many players run around with them all the time lol 
---
Yikes.
---
PSN is biffpipp im level 17
---
You aren't shit. I didn't touch a Scorchbeast until I was level 70 with good power armor and a two shot 50 Cal. Until then I ran away. And taking your time and exploring is where the fun is at. All these people who nuke rush are missing out.
---
Clancy Manor to the north west. Just west of Hemlock Holes. When I went back to make sure of the location, I noticed the "host" also had a carrot in front of them! Well... HAD a carrot in front of them...
---
Now that’s what this game is all about
---
Added support for trapper armor base name. &lt;3
---
I'd say TS is better than AP for the gatling. Even if you're able to get the 95% AP, not sure of the answer to gaining 95%, it'll still not going to perform as well as the TS version due to how DR works. Since the mods for it don't affect it's dmg, excluding prime, the additional projectile is basically double dmg in the end iirc.
---
Sidenote, gatlings are my favorite weapons and I hope you have fun with yours as well!
---
Maybe their friends are intelligent enough to understand that there’s more than one way to skin a radiated cat?  
---
Yeah, that about sums it up. 
---
It doesn't help that (without duping) I accidentally  had about 6000 crafting benches, lighted posters, and water purifiers in my build menu.  I have no Idea how it happened. 
---
Two things: first this was a co-op game that they added pvp to. Second, some people don't like it. Those people should be able to enjoy the game the way they want. So they should be able to turn off pvp. The people that like it can keep it on. 
---
Thank you for your insight on Healing Factors guys, I really appreciate it. Im currently working on a glass cannon heavy weapons build, so I was hoping this mutations would let us minimize how much more chems and food/drinks we had to carry. Thank you again!
---
My daughter is 7, and is very mature.  We play alot of video games together, and fallout is on of my favorite series.  However this isn't one I would let her touch for several more years.  Sure I played mortal combat when I was her age, but it was also black and white on a gameboy.  Everyone can parent how they want, but I think decapitation, nuclear war, and flying eyeballs is too much for a 7 year old. 
---
On PS4 just tried the queen and it was unplayable, went through 5k .50 rounds don't know if any got anywhere close the lag and fps was horrendous. Another episode like that and unfortunately I'll have to move on...
---
Same boat family. Spend so much resources building shit just to dissconnect
---
&gt; 40% better power attacks
---
It's "40% increased swing speed", that should be attack speed or do you just swing faster and still have to wait for the time you just saved?
---
my all around build is handmade vat crits, not the best but I can solo her with 15min left on the timer. my melee build she doesnt stand a chance once she lands
---
That's how games work, and how they should work.
---
I am one of those that horded technical data . There are no paints available from that quest aside from initiate, I can 100% guarantee it. Nobody is asking for the mob to do anything.. asking for Bethesda cto do something... Anything
---
Cool
---
Where do u do runs
---
Fellow gamer girl who also broke up with their ex just before Christmas. I'm alright at video games but a lot of the times he wouldn't play games with me because I didn't play them the same way. I feel you girl! There are many fish in the sea and I'm sure we can find people who like our gaming style. I've also been playing fo76 a lot slower than him but it's how I play all open world games, I like to find every secret. Haven't killed a scorchbeast on my own yet and I'm level 62 so kudos to you! :)
---
Gamer gfs/fiancé/wife = best gf/fiancé/wife. IMO 
---
Just your photos as they are local and not uploaded in any way. 
---
These posts are entertaining. Thanks.
---
Cool man. I'm trying to get more as well. This is what I got so far
---
I so love the whistle on reload.  
---
Aim at the feet, crawl up to the head when firing.
---
..... Bruh
---
Wish I had a High lvl alt. I took the sunshine industrial farm, defended against the multiple ways waves of Commie boots and thought I was GTG for a while. Nope... As I was trying to place an extractor on one of the resource nodes (can't remember which) here comes a level 30 or 40 something in PA that starts shooting at me... It was doing very little damaged so I ran and hid in my chameleon armor, but they found me anyway. I ran to my junk collector, grabbed what it had collected so far and hopped servers. Hindsight I should have fought. I had previously dumped all my good junk when I claimed the WS anyway. I just didn't want the hassle. Best I could hope for is to make them use a Stempack. I was only lvl 10 or 12 at the time. 
---
I feel your pain, server DCs are a right pain.
---
2 tips to help life
---
1. If a friend is online, join their world before you do the silo, you can group with them or not, but check that they will stay in the world for long enough to do the silo+launch, they are your anchor to that world.
---
If no friend is available, invite randoms til you get someone accept. If they accept and see you launch most figure it out and either join you or stay in the group. If your in team and you get dc'd or crash to desktop it automatically rejoins your team when you restart the game and your can easily rejoin your nuke.
---
I learned that pretty much all random invites are people wanting anchors or free fast travel.
---
2. Get prepped repaired and to the silo, than log out and power your unit off and back on again. Im not sure if there is memory  leak or what but ive had better luck with no dcs after a full power cycle.
---
Yep, towards the end of the enclave quest line you'll get an orbital scan grenade and an orbital strike grenade aswell as the ability to craft both.
---
me too!
---
Stack as many dmg multipliers as possible, perks, chems, bobble heads, all that stuff is easy to come by 
---
Hmmmm... I actually like the way it is. Looks pretty good with the combat armor
---
Dang, sorry for your ammo loss. If you do decide to move on make sure you stay up to date with thier patches in hopes of the servers stabilizing. 
---
What’s scan do
---
Duping was a major issue in Ark for a long time. But eventually they were able to get on it and many many large groups were banned.
---
Bethesda is a AAA game studio. Their recent patches have showed that they are rapidly trying to fix their mistakes. I still have confidence that they will be able to address this and we will be happier a month or so from now.
---
&gt; I saw patch notes for the queen getting fixed
---
You did?
---
The multiple shots are always best.
---
Well it really isn’t that hard.
---
Thank you !
---
the way you get back at them is, you just leave and let the queen kill them all.
---
Raider Power armor only comes in lv 25
---
Nice
---
Exactly, glad you are saying it yourself. As soon as low people join, she gains more HP and resistance. If im alone or with 3 people I know, she is dead in 3minutes max
---
I get the feeling a lot of these complainers come from  only playing single player Bethesda games and have zero idea how an online game is supposed to function. 
---
👶🏻👶🏼👶🏽👶🏾👶🏿
---
he would probably d/c, i know i do when a stupid fucking scorchbeast starts to tear my house down
---
Good job, you go girl!
---
I thought you could get it at 15
---
We do it all, except for the bobbleheads
---
I move my game to my SSD. I don't uninstall it. You just need a symlink and move manually the FO76 folder.
---
Mhm it was mentioned somewhere that they made her land more frequently now, which I find to be true most of the time. Even the queen is a bit picky on where she parks her royalty 
---
Nah
---
Fake News.
---
Nice, bmneed to find a few of these myself
---
Yes, it's PC. 2k would allow me to buy my first mutation, this has to be a sign. ;)
---
Hit me up ingame "widardd".
---
Trying to devise ways to get people into them is another story. I've been thinking about making my base a maze. Then getting a bounty and see if anyone bites.
---
Nuka cola plant, at least 4, get a perk that adds more caps and the bobble head. Then sever jump.  Also a perk to hear them i think. 
---
You on ps4? I can craft you the legs if you can make my chest peace shadowed
---
Not hard to achieve if you grind above all else.
---
Gotta find the second one.
---
Lol we did when we had only 5minutes left, we kept trying but knew it was a big fail.. *Sigh* :(
---
It's how I play to, fuck those guys. 
---
If you like that playstyle I'd recommend Skyrim.
---
So tired of the dupers
---
Ok thanks for helping out
---
Ungh. They'd get way more flak if they pushed content and not bug fixes...
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TR7FC-h0Fb8
---
Uhhhhh. Correction:
---
- That wasn’t general server lag; that was server load times just being slow. I see it when just looting regular drops at times. More unique item types just exaggerate the issue.
---
It’s inaccurate to lay general sever instability at the feet of someone who just has a lot of stuff.
---
Servers don’t treat 2 vs 2000000 of an item differently. And you can legitimately have enough unique items to cause trade load lag through regular play. I’ve done it on junk haul runs.
---
This is good work but considering the end game is in found legendaries there isn't much to do with it. I just mod based on best legendary attribute I find. The difference between the dr, ER, and RR on most types isn't usually worth taking a less ideal legendary over. And any time that I need a lot of resistance I'll be wearing pa.
---
Didja win!?
---
people who call a game, that has no paid content other than outfits, a cash grab are just ignorant. Someone needs to start calling these people out. kudos to you for doing that. 
---
The lack of communication with the community is honestly starting to bum me out. I have no hate to throw at beth. They are my fav studio, and 76 is my fav game by them so far.  The exploiting is such a problem though, and I cannot believe it is not something that was addressed right away. they need to be banned permanently, I dont even pick up bags anymore because i dont want ill gotten shit, much less trade with anyone. Bethesda has always released rocky games.  are we forgetting that skyrim was basically unplayable until the ps4 version?  But bethesda, has always made things work in the end. I have little doubt they will do that now. 
---
Sadly, the Whitespring. Golf balls, clubs, cue sticks, pool balls, stacked soda cups, plastic plates.
---
Thanks, i did not think about trying that.
---
If we are talking realism, you can't wear a tattered, sleeveless dress that completely hides the fact that you have heavy, bulky, spiky armor on underneath it. And also on your arms which inexplicably now look bare.
---
is that literally with your fists or with a deathclaw gauntlet or simillar?
---
I know twisted muscles affects gauntlets, as does the unarmed perk, but does talons too?
---
Yet another PC sneaky lady. Ive become a bit more combat oriented lately, but I play slow and enjoy all the details. I'm still pretty new though; level 15, first play through. 
---
I only have one friend who plays 76, and he stampedes around, murdering everything before I even see it.  So, if any of y'all want someone else to kick around with, message me!
---
At least it is a lightweight burden.
---
All dupers can personally suck my left nut, I fucking hate them.
---
Do it yourself?
---
How exactly does dupping in fallout 76 work? Is it selling a lot of stuff to vendors? I wanna know cause I usually stockpile weapons to sell but I don’t wanna ruin anyone’s experience and if this does that I’ll stop
---
I play a ton of online games, I can think of none that would be cool with a player duping hundreds of thousands of items that grant you in-game currency.
---
DEGENERATES LIKE THESE BELONG ON A CROSS
---
Ok, so Hitler did nothing wrong because he was playing the "rule your country" game differently and within the laws of his country? I'm not saying anyone is playing wrong. I am saying you can do something that's completely legitimate or correct and still be inconsiderate or an asshole. Its not illegal to park your regular car in a electric vehicle spot but it does make you a selfish asshole for blocking a spot that someone needs to charge their car.
---
I really am not even invested in this issue because I don't really have a problem with it. I'm just explaining that people taking up resources when they aren't even in the game is a dick move because people who are in the game can't get them. People are investing their time and life force into doing something that is being ruined by someone else lazily leaving their pc to idle for hours on end. 
---
I thought about that too, but I think it would be impracticable to implement it since unlike fallout 4 you can remove perks at will (so if you unequip a weight reduction perk how would you handle having an overweight stash?).. Instead I would rather see another set of perks separate from the main just for camps, which isn't a bad idea given how camp building is so popular as an in game activity.
---
Lol, that was clever.
---
Exactly so. 
---
People seem to think having a lot of items is what causes instability and it’s spreading misinformation everywhere.
---
U can
---
are those serums permanent? Like if I get speed demon will I gain the speed demon mutation forever with starched genes?
---
I haven’t seen any infiltrators yet. But even so, it’s a community so people can always message that so and so isn’t legit etc. I haven’t had any bad experiences as of yet and honestly as long as everyone is chill and enjoying playing the game, I’m game. 
---
I laughed out loud at this. For realsies. 
---
Thank you.. 
---
Hey I know that you probably won’t see this but I want to say: you are not a “gamer girl” you are just a gamer. Good job on beating the scorchbeast!
---
Two shot weapons kill PvP in this game. I hope and would not be surprised if the developers release an update soon that drastically dampens the damage output of two shot and explosive round weapons in PvP. So if you like PvP and aim to use your Gatling against other players for the long term, maybe think about dodging OP variants like explosive rounds and two shots. If you don't care about PvP. Then two shot would be stronger in a wider variety of pve situations. 
---
I'm looking for PvP players on xbox one, so if you fancy trying hunter/ hunted radio, shout at me 
---
How is it that one client could crash a server? Do the dupping client suffer from lag when not dupping? So technically a handful of dupers could cripple the servers entirely? 
---
That's what I Read to
---
Its not system related i have a ps4 pro with an upgraded sshd. Its defo fallouts shitty servers and dimwhitted dev team
---
Exactly, thank you..
---
Anybody here miss the duping glitch with arrows in oblivion?
---
That was actually kind of fun
---
I didn't even know friendly dogs were in this game. This is some really good news to me.
---
This, Morgantown has a ton of cobalt.
---
How do I spot them and drive them away? 
---
This would be too much. 
---
20000000 grenades would then be treated as each being a unique item that needs to be tracked.
---
You’d overload the servers, which are already terribly shoddy. Not to mention hardware and upkeep costs 
---
I would probably just wait it out 
---
Garbage game tho so meh..
---
what do sales have to do with anything though?  fixing exploits is not about selling the game, its about making the game playable for the supporting community.  I am pretty sure bethesda knows how sales windows work. just no idea how it applies to this convo. 
---
Than you're wrong. I know how an online game is supposed to function. I get the feeling a lot of these apologists are making bank from exploiting an online game. Two can play at that game :P
---
Man I always assumed that was a bug and that plan just didn't unlock anything. I mean a tuba isn't even a wind instrument...
---
You should be able to craft "disease cure" at a chemistry station.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Disease_cure
---
My camp seems to eat stuff. I dropped some junk for my friend to finish his PA 40 some screws. Poof gone. I pulled indoors and check roof. Just gone. It sucked
---
Yup, just northeast of the golf shop there is a little river with some as well. 
---
Someone just spent $60k on ragnarok online. 
---
I think.  I skimmed the article. 
---
Nope, you should be fine. I don't know exactly how it works, and I am absolutely uninterested in finding out, but I think you have build a bunch of something really quick?? That's the extent of my knowledge haha.
---
"Complainers". Lol this game isn't doing so hot right now, they should probably fix broken shit like this that wouldn't last a week in actual prominent and highly played online titles.
---
Happened to me the other day. Except I had like 50 something and late it jumped up to 80. Once I relogged it went back to normal. I'm not sure what caused it but it may have been repair.
---
But are mules a problem, too? Clearly you aren't supposed to have that many items on a mule. The stache increase to 600 was a stability concern for Bethesda, and now you have people holding a hundred thousand pounds worth of stuff on mules. How can that not be a problem while stache inventory is? 
---
And you are telling us that you have nearly 500,000 scrap steel that you have managed to transfer between your main and alt? First, why do you need that much steel? Second, how many times have you made transfers between your characters and what method did you use?
---
The fact that you are that level either means you play this game A LOT or that you used experience exploits, which would leave me to believe you use other exploits. 
---
After they fix duping. They should either ban dupers or reset all their chars
---
How should it have been done to handle this properly? 
---
https://imgur.com/a/NKsZ4sc
---
Go ahead and explain to me both how these amounts of items could be legitimately obtained, or how it's "mod justice" to expect someone to be punished for having literal millions of bulk junk.
---
It definitely helps to have the crippling perk card for your weapon of choice, or it could be a _while_.
---
I've been leaving duplicate plans at workshops.  I may do this.
---
That's the best to enjoy many games out there, especially fallout and other open games. I've played games just to beat them and was unimpressed, then after playing again but paying more attention to everything i learned more lore and appreciated environmental storytelling. Your exes probably just ran in and shot everything. Trying to be and damaging as possible to enemies etc. Hope you enjoy the rest of the game I'm about same level as you are and better luck with guys out there
---
Again, I love helping newbies, as soon as I encounter one, first thing I do is wave at em, tell them to come to me and I drop them some stuff so they have a bit easier life in Fallout. This post is not about hating low levels (We have all been there) But the problem is the Queen is near impossible to kill when they just tag and hide, just like more people are saying in here. :(
---
That's simple... you take the bag
---
This is how I play too. Admittedly I don't play that much, but from Assassins Creed to Red Dead Redemption I like to stalk my target and clear out an area with stealth, especially if I know I don't have the dps to do melee fights. I'm becoming more comfortable running in and giving it a go, but for a long time I was really uncomfortable playing in front of my bf because he games a lot and I generally hate failing in front of people doing something that should be relatively "easy". He really enjoys that I'm gaming more, even if they aren't always the same kind of games he plays, and finds my timid style cute \^\_\^;
---
handmade rifle plans are a reward for doing the event patrol duty, 
---
the event has a few different patrol routes, 
---
i got the handmade plans mine when the route was d block/yard/solitary
---
i did it twice though a block/b block/yard and did not get handmade
---
Keep gaming, you'll only get better. Never care what people think. Its hard but shit it out and keep on exploring!
---
likely because name shaming violates the discords rules. 
---
By shit you must mean THE BEST SHIT EVER.
---
modus is a really good character and Bethesda did great with the enclave for this game
---
he's like a mixture of The Master and Mr House.
---
Yeah the dupers are out of hand, it has gotten to the point where there is no economy in the game do to them.
---
Honestly this is Bethesda's fault. As much as I hate what dupers are doing to the game, they way they make Fallout games really works best for co-op/casual PvP among friends.
---
They are never going to get rid of enough bugs and balance issues to make serious PvP or even just competitive PvE worthwhile.
---
This game is best when playing with friends and not worrying about dickheads your fun. If they'd released this as a private hosted server that anyone could run and invite their friends, I'd be so addicted to it right now. 
---
Definitely true. I hope they make some kind of set bonuses to make things more interesting
---
Is the crashing part causing everyone to lag? 
---
I understand why she’d get gold, etc. But why are her responses getting downvoted? 
---
how exactly?
---
What Silver Shroud outfit?
---
That's the loyal dog that stays by his two dead owners, right?
---
Just ban every duper. I'd rather play a dead game than a broken one.
---
You don’t spend development over head on a game that underperformed at launch. You spend as little of your profits as possible to fix a game that didn’t make your sales goals. If the fix is hard, you only do it if it completely breaks the game, like the silo glitch. In other words, they aren’t losing revenue to appease us. 
---
That makes sense. I know it's to prevent witch hunts, but the mods should know in this case, we're dealing with real scum and it's not an illegitimate callout
---
I've had only a few times where the queen was finished in 5min. Every other time is around 10-15min due to there being seven or more level 40's or below joining with hunting rifles. On a good run, I use around 500-700 5mm rounds; on a bad run, I use around 2k 5mm rounds and have to repair my broken gun.
---
I'm all for low levels joining the fight to be perfectly honest, I help out players in every game I play. But Fallout 76 punishes us for helping others and a lot of times even just interacting with others. I'd argue that the queen should only gain a small increase to HP and resistances per player, or a more complex system that takes each player's stats into account but we all know how much that's asking from Beth.
---
Ill ask him about it but it look just like it. I was shocked
---
10x, I doubt it. 
---
No they do not, unless they are bugged they drop no loot. IF they drop loot that means the person was over budget or it wasn't a pet. 
---
Giving an item a unique Id isn’t hard on servers. You are over complicating a simple implementation. Most games already do this and most games are 10x bigger than this game. Bethesda just doesn’t know what they’re doing in the multiplayer space 
---
Just wanted to add my name to the list of ultra-PA going missing (ps4).    I don't remember ever even seeing the additional frame, if it was ever awarded. It is entirely possible I did the same as the op, saw an additional frame, though "oh sh\*&amp;, no wonder I'm over capacity, and instantly dropped or scrapped it.  It wouldn't be so bad if there way to re-obtain it.Oh well, it's not the first unique item this game has robbed me of, won't be the last.
---
I think the game is getting the hate because Bethesda could have released a decent product and chose not to. That's my opinion and the opinion of all my real life friends who have stopped playing. I don't mind no npcs but the amount of locations/pois on the map with nothing but a single note that tells a story for this particular location but doesn't really have any impact on the world itself. They feel shallow.  
---
To me there is zero feeling of character progression and end-game content is currently a joke. Kill a queen or farm legendaries. And see the games mechanics crumble around you in the process.  
---
The bugs and exploits that still exist even to this day are absolutely ridiculous. Server stability is a joke, crafting boiled water and leveling up sometimes dc's me. I still can't place a power armor station in my base without it ending up on the roof. Turrets and robots still randomly die when you're near them. Legendaries don't always drop legendaries. Every time I get in my PA II have to manually equip the chest piece. Sometimes I forget... And let's not even get into pvp.  
---
In my opinion the experience of playing the game is more painful and annoying due to issues, bugs and content with zero player agency and choice than enjoyable or fun.
---
I still wear that bowler.
---
Pharma Farma is a pretty good perk card to get loads of chems and meds. For me, antibiotics spawn the most with it.
---
Or they were disconnected from the server or bluescreen. I love this game but am really getting tired of this. If they fix the stability I can live with all the other bullshit.
---
I have given up on making a defensive perimeter. I have found that a single Heavy Laser Turret at ground-level aimed at my crops does a pretty good job of keeping enemies from destroying them and has enough HP to fight back for a while. But it would probably take less budget to just build foundations+walls around some dirt to make an "indoor garden" to protect them instead.
---
This showed up in my feed, I play WoW and I'm over it. I've always loved it but wanting something new to play because the content has just become pretty ridiculous, is fallout a good game to move to? I want something that I can sneak around in haha because I'm also terrible at combat. Any game recommendations would be appreciated!
---
Very nice! There's something in particular about the play of silhouettes in this. The mushroom cloud being almost centered beyond the transmission tower especially. Overall I really like the composition. Only thing I'd change I think? Having the figure facing the cloud. Even so, it took me a little bit to realize they were *not* facing it.
---
Don't worry, I'm only level 9
---
Ubisoft had to do this with the deployable shield glitch, where a Defender could mess with the animation system and block their head from getting shot. At first, only Jaëger could do it, and the method was patched out.
---
Unfortunately, it only fixed one method of doing it. Someone quickly figured how to do it, and do it with any Defending operator with a shield. Ubisoft ended up redoing how shields worked from the ground up to stamp out any further exploitation, and it worked.
---
Reminds me of Oxhorn. 
---
Yes!  Very nice!  
---
Couldn't they limit the crafting spam per second to something the server could actually handle? 
---
Wow! Either they are slowly creeping up or you ran across a feral mutt that couldn't be asked to chase you. Either way, I hope you tried throwing it a meat bomb 
---
Great job for you.  Having been a victim of narcissistic abuse by an ex-partner, I understand how toxic people can be.  Suspect your ex was a narcissist.
---
If you need help in game (assuming you are on PC), add me: Beaglejack2020.
---
I’m currently level 200 with not much to do other than to explore.  I’ve made a thread volunteering to help anyone that needs it already, so I’m happy to extend offer to you as well (and anyone reading this).
---
Oh, I play the same way and explore extensively. 
---
I finally found an use for stealth boy! 
---
Cant solo the queen
---
I can see why you have two ex-BFs...
---
On the North West of the map there's a Lumber Mill with Super Mutants. I set up my CAMP and farmed my level 15 Raider set there and jumped right into at when I hit 15.
---
People tend 2 spawn too her
---
Well...it clearly wasn’t aimed at you...
---
Swarm*
---
Idk why you’re being downvoted, you’re asking a legitimate question and I’m genuinely curious about this too. Wouldn’t the items on the ground disappear?
---
Are the notes all near by? Or scattered around the area? It figures that with this new character build I’ve got I’m not collecting every single holo tape lol
---
Excuse me but where did I say Bethesda should not fix the exploits?
---
I'm criticizing your solutions, which most of the time is just some form of "ban everyone who doesn't play the game the way I expect them to"
---
Yes they were *clearly* talking about the one example of clear duping and not all the other ones that may or may not have been duping. 
---
You mean slamming two existing IP together, slapping a new label on it and selling the crap out of it is a lazy cash grab. Come in, I got a dog helmet as a drop. That’s from Fallout 4. Lazy cash grab. 
---
So insta kill for jumping on a enemy when you have power armour? Seems pretty balanced.
---
I spent about 30 mins server hopping while around Harper's Ferry before I decided to try Watoga. Only had to hop once for Watoga. From what I understand, trying as soon as you hit 15 is recommended because after that point other weapons plans may push out your % chance to pick up the one you are looking for. And honestly for levelling there is nothing better at low levels than main quests and workshops for the building/crafting xp and the frequent defense events too. Just my take, but it went pretty quick on my 2nd.
---
Nice! Can you put that model on thingiverse so other people can print it?
---
I've been wearing the Hunters Long Coat with a Battered Fedora and Patrolmen sunglasses. Looks similar. 
---
Some buds and I have an interesting way of dealing with ppl lie this. It's devious and works well and then their junk is never seen again :-) I will happily slow walk across all of WV to do a canon ball into an ultracite pit so none of that junk will ever be gotten again lol
---
I had the same experience with machine gun turrets, but my shotgun turrets are much better with target acquisition and damage.
---
I have personal experience from trading a large amount of items while communicating with 10 different people on the server. The only people that lag are those that are trading.
---
Bethesda Admins are the ones I want giving US the power to met out justice, how is punishing someone you KNOW for a fact is abusing the system and has been marked for a super delicious bounty MOB justice? Its a sactioned stoning, and kills two birds with one stone
---
Bird1: content, a reason for players to stop what their doing and rush the target that the admin has marked for the bounty and the duper crapping his pants when he realizes he has been reported and judged AND is about to get gang plowed. 
---
BIRD2: discourages dupers because they know if someone catches them and reports to an admin who catches them red handed by simply WATCHING them dupe, their ill gottwn gains willl be wiped along with their stash.
---
Seriously, the only people who would complain about dupers being pubished by the playerbase are..dupers. 
---
Recently had to do a full Win 10 re install and it's fine! Progress is saved server side.
---
Only that we know of.  With the way that privacy has evaporated over the last couple decades I'm suprised Bethesda doesn't have our thumbprints provided by PS4 and Xbox controllers.  Big Brother knows all
---
maybe to curb shit like this Beth need a cap on quantity number for any given item, maybe 999, 
---
yeah i know soom legit peeps like to carry more of certain items like ammo for example, it just means you need to craft more often :)
---
&gt;But are mules a problem, too?
---
No, Pyrk. Mules are not a problem. 
---
Is this ur only character? I dont have alot of exp in the fallout games... Just this one. But if you wanna blaze and explore and learn, I'm down. 
---
Any recommendations on how to handle the combat system? I find it terribly cumbersome and in the heat of battle totally unresponsive.
---
- Switching weapons seems wholly unreliable and the wheel seems far worse than the Fallout 4 directional system
---
- Heavy attacks seem unreliable
---
- Grenades seem to take too long trigger (long hold on right bumper on controller)
---
- Stimpaks never seem to trigger when I’m hitting the button
---
- My whole system (XboxOne S) seems to crawl when there’s 3 or more people, and forget about shooting something like the sub machine gun with an animated high rate of fire
---
Maybe all of these are because I’m playing on console, but it seems like a pretty fundamental part of the game given int’s nature.
---
Advice would be gladly accepted on how to improve the whole situation because I do enjoy the game, I just am discouraged frequently by the combat.
---
Dude that's how I knew I found the one.
---
1. Very high mutual attraction.
---
2. Love food and fitness
---
3. Can talk for hours about passion, introspection, analyses
---
4. Super comfy vibe of trust from one another
---
5. At our first party, found the soul caliber tournament in the back room. He got trashed early having never played. I made it to top 4 being a long time soul caliber veteran with a household of competitive guys growing up. After everyone started passing out he challenged me to a duel. We proceeded to fight until he finally learned to kick my ass. It took him hours. We stopped playing at 8am and I made pancakes for everyone left in the house. Super fun night. We learned we both have that temperament to not get emotional and to enjoy breaking down mechanics and figuring out puzzles on the fly... for hours. 
---
I hate seeing this "they don't care" shit. Companies that run games that work perfectly don't give a shit about you either buddy. They *all* just want your money. 
---
yeah....this game is not exactly out of development either though is it? I see the argument that you are trying to make now. But this is a mmo. it's not skyrim. and if beth is to be believed....and lets not open that can of worms rn, 76 is far from out of development. And once again, we are talking about fixing exploits, not patching quests. So, idk i think this has maybe gotten to far from the op. 
---
Dam dupers
---
I can always tell when duping is going on somewhere and make it a point to sneak up on who ever is doing it just to observe. I wish there was an in game way to find a playername and report in game. 
---
No they need to just banhammer them into oblivion. 
---
Excellent work. I'd be happy to look at more along these lines. The scenery shots especially. You've got an eye.
---
Exactly. It’s a business, not a non profit. It’s all about money. 
---
Power Patcher lowers the repair cost of fixing PA. Here's a list of max level PAs.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all\_max\_level\_power\_armors\_stats/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all_max_level_power_armors_stats/)
---
TBH thats a better deal than most stuff in the atomic shop.
---
Wasn’t this patched ages ago?
---
Uh huh. What's your point, that we shouldn't ban people that have ridiculous amounts of items that couldn't possibly be obtained through legitimate means?
---
Yea, encountered the same earlier today around 3p to 5p eastern (Atlanta).  Game kept booting my son and I, when it didn’t it was laggy.  Hopefully better this eve.  
---
Super duper is not helpful for someone working on excavator. I'm sure anyone high enough level for that perk would have built excavator a long time ago
---
Literally all comments are about dudes being nice except for me 😂
---
Unfortunately, IIRC the texure glitch is still there (where instead of showing the belly button it's a corrupted texture)
---
They 100% do drop loot. I've  had buddies slaughter my tamed pets many time for science testing respawn mechanics. 
---
They won't drop loot for party members or whomever tamed them but a rando murder hobo gets all the screws out of your death sloth
---
It's like waiting for Santa
---
Fuck dupers, stop ruining the god damn game for everyone.
---
Don’t know why these guys keep downvoting you.  It’s really frustrating being a female gamer.  I’ve had guys follow me halfway across the map when they realized I was a (real life girl) trying to pvp me.  The result?  I’m a pretty badass sniper.  They regretted their decision.
---
Yeah, they need to focus on this over anything else. Exploiters are the worst part of the game for me. Imagine running around playing Battlefield or COD with everyone running around with aim bot or constant kill streaks. 
---
It is basically GTA:Online when it came out; riddled with cheaters breaking the game
---
Oh, I am sorry, I understand now, you are just a whiner. wtg. 
---
Luck doesn't work this way. Unless you mean your real life luck.
---
I got super lucky, some dude died in a Blast Zone with 20 Bulk Concrete. I remember the struggle, especially with my all brick c.a.m.p 
---
What kills me as that there are cinderblocks scattered around and every time I see them, my brain assumes I can collect them for scrap for whatever reason.
---
I’ve completed a good majority of it solo, but I did play with another person occasionally early on. The “Inspirational” charisma perk for extra xp while on a team is great. So even during some of those times i was playing solo i was technically on a “team” with someone else. essentially so we both could use that perk card for extra xp gains. If you’re ever interested Im willing to “team up,” share my inspirational perk card with you if you don’t have it, and then just be a ghost in the background unless you need help. It honestly helps out both of us. 
---
As for questing, I mostly just wander and do things as I happen to find them. I did do the personal matters quest for the overseer which took me all over the map. I still haven’t completed the quest that’s like “follow the overseer’s journey” bc you don’t get any map markers for it until you stumble upon certain locations.  So, for the most part, I just complete quest lines as i find them, and travel around helping others when I can. 
---
PC
---
&gt; I'm just explaining that people taking up resources when they aren't even in the game is a dick move because people who are in the game can't get them.
---
If people wanted free farming with no competition they shouldn't have logged into a multiplayer PvP-enabled game.
---
&gt;People are investing their time and life force into doing something that is being ruined by someone else lazily leaving their pc to idle for hours on end.
---
So log off and do something else, because clearly the game as designed and as intended is causing you to waste your life.
---
But if it’s still in development, how do you resell the idea to those that were not interested or turned off by the bugs and glitches?
---
It just works 
---
Reminds me of the Legendary bloatfly(one of the if not the strongest enemy ingame) in new vegas...this game generally had very nasty insect enemies...
---
Lol, fallout flashdance
---
&gt; first this was a co-op game that they added pvp to.
---
It always had PvP. If you didn't check the specs before buying then tough luck.
---
&gt;Second, some people don't like it. Those people should be able to enjoy the game the way they want.
---
Oh shit, ok. I don't enjoy Fallout 76 with Scorchbeasts. I want Dragons. Bethesda please patch it for me.
---
Those are some huge hooters.
---
I understand that it has issues but I also enjoy it. You're not some genius that sees things others can't. 
---
I still don’t know how people aren’t overencumbered by this.
---
What system? 
---
Always love when people cannot logically argue they resort to name calling. Congratulations. 
---
Saw you use 40mm, if you’re on Xbox I have 123 you can have. I need to clear space.
---
What are duper’s
---
Go to Camden park and climb to the top of the roller coaster, take the key from the two dead corpses up top.  
---
Then go to the New River Gorge Bridge, near the Creamery, the west side, there's a lower level with a locked room.  Open the room with the key from Camden, and inside is always a power armor bench with leveled power armor pieces.
---
This is how I farmed my Level 15 Raider set.
---
Fuck warning them, ban them all on first offense. They don't deserve to play.
---
???
---
I'll have to look that up, thanks for the heads up!
---
Oh awesome! I'm honestly just exploring around and then I plan on going along (finally) with some of the main story :) so if that's not gonna be boring for you, please join me! 
---
I never even said that. Do you make a habit of spinning what people say to feed your outrage boner? Seems unhealthy but you do you. 
---
You should be able to stomp an any rodent or bug in power armor and instant kill them.
---
Why do they need 305 boards?(What even is it?)
---
This.
---
If you dupe then why should privacy, as far as FO76 is concerned, be protected? I'm sorry... will the harassment ruin the game for you? Shit that sounds familiar.
---
Was in the process of fast traveling, so I pickeded up my phone, saw the title of this post, and my game crashed. So yes, it is unstable today!
---
Or asking for fun when they get flagged for pvp with 10 cap bounty. I set up a camp with a sloth outside of Morgantown train station. Picked off so many folks trying to kill him. Easiest free scrap and bounty collection
---
Should ban people making mule accounts

No.  It starts as low as at level 15.  You know nothing Jon Snow.

It already is, that's where I got it from. :)

No, there are large scale operations that have tons of people.  The desperate work for them by playing 18 hours a day, farming whatever items they can so they can make pennies on the dollar when one sells.
---
CGO
---
Dont worrry i was to. And about to get offended at the suggestion that 2000 rds was a lot
---
I’m speaking as a developer. One who routinely has to deal with database and server issues.
---
If every item has a unique Id, it then needs to be stored and tracked, which means the database needs to be designed and able to handle such quantities...which costs money and larger data sets with cause performance hits when reading, writing, or working with said data.
---
You could potentially mitigate this depending on how you set up your database, but it’s going to quickly get out of hand.
---
This is what you’re suggesting when you say give *every* individual item a unique ID.
---
This will eventually cause quite a few lag issues due to inventory accessing. Remember when they were worried about the technical difficulties of the stash?
---
Now if you want to say unique IDs for a subset of items not meant to gathered in extreme quantities? Such as weapons? Maybe.
---
I can’t imagine having a database that treated every single round and grenade and junk item as a unique entity. That’d get ridiculous. Fast.
---
And there's a lot of people who fail.
---
same
---
Why hide the name??
---
No, this guy is right. I've got almost 200 hours in. I don't want to do another to get back to where I am. I would be done. And so would many others given the way our minds normally perceive sunk costs.
---
At all actually. Fuck me right? 
---
I dunno I think its just RNG more than anything, ive got a mutation in my first rad dip and my longest took 8 trips to the shower before I got one.
---
I have the healing hands mutation and probably got 15 ish after playing the lottery and getting HH.
---
I might be wrong but it also feels like a double proc process, so you roll for a chance on a mutation, than when you get a chance it rolls again on 18 slots or however many mutations there are and you get the mutation in that slot, if you already have that mutation its a miss and you have to wait for another mutation chance to proc.
---
Keep at er buddy and good luck out there.
---
I don't know if it is true or not but I have found placing turrets on any structure stops them from working properly, they only seem to attack when attacked, but when placed on the ground they seem to have decent range and will engage anything within range
---
No sorry this is a screen shot i took so im not able to get a higher res one.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Added a few more things. 
---
Its good but it could be better. 
---
Btw the 90% less weight doesn't affect mods, luckily the allstar mod(aluminum bat) for baseball bats *lowers* the weight (while being the best mod for the material slot) to 0 lbs with this reduction.
---
Tags everything in it's scan area like that of a recon scope.
---
People that exploit the game causing server stability issues , destroying the player market , PVP and PVE by flooding the game with items that are not suppose to be easy to obtain.
---
They do this by taking one item and making 1000s of copies of it. 
---
Pretty much just a very nasty and scummy thing to do.
---
bro, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. implying development time, if for fixing exploits? Bringing up sales windows? How high are you right now? either way you have proven you have no clue what you are talking about, the the sales window for me caring about the opinion of a whining cash grab crybaby is over, have a nice Saturday night. I hope to never share a server with you. 
---
How do you make copies?
---
Does the Hallucinegen grenade do anything to other players? 
---
This duping thing explains the constant goddamned lag and disconnects that have been happening for days.
---
Anyone else have any ideas for greifing dupers? I've got some choice audio to pipe through my mic input while in "area" chat range.
---
All they'll do is  log in with another account and continue their BS. Thats not enough and no fun for US, make their punishment more content and duscourage duping across the board people will be encouraged to report and once they're caught in the act its time to purge the duper.
---
It's a bit late so you probably figured this out already but Somerville isn't in fallout 76 its in fallout 4.
---
If the lvl 100$ kills ya he'll be loosing at least 100 caps when someone one shots him. Greifing is a great way to loose all your caps quick.
---
fixing an exploit has WHAT to do with reselling an idea? LOL just stop. 
---
This is the reason I'm on hiatus from 76. I can't play a single hour without some game breaking lag and disconnects anymore. I've got to my limit and found another game to hold me off until Beth starts to actually manage their servers a little. The patches they release do nothing to actually stabilize the servers as it's only a bandaid on the gunshot wound that is the duplication glitch.    
---
These people need to be permabanned.
---
I'm mostly in the camp of being understanding about this, but honestly this is 100% a situation where they should be working overtime and postponing vacation. They released a product that had flaws, and they're working on fixing them, that's fine. But there are also some massive flaws that borderline ruin the game that are getting worse every day they don't fix it. I remember when black ops 4 launched and people were having glitches left and right, constant crashes, etc. The zombies subreddit was just filled with nothing but complaints and memes about ps4 bluescreens for ages. At one point we had daily updates for a whole week trying to fix up the messy state it was in. Obviously that kind of effort is going above and beyond, we can't *expect* bethesda to put their employees through that if they do have other matters to attend to in their lives. But in this state it really is expected that they do *something* beyond their previously scheduled job
---
Your not looking to do it?, Just want to point out very good chance Bethesda will swing the ban hammer on all accounts that duped.
---
Where do you have the best luck seeing Graham? I've only seen him maybe twice and I'm 138
---
Did you get the Bethesda Net launcher working on Linux? If so, how?
---
for some reason 300 is whats trigger the game server to disconnect you
---
I mean, they have to pay for another account. That's whatever. What you're proposing would probably sound plenty good to people that want PVP servers. Cheaters should be flat-out banned from the game. End of. 
---
I agree. But also they could just temporarily put a cap on item stacks and it would fix at least the method I have heard of.
---
That's really not a solution so much as it is a soft limiter. These people can still buy new licenses and farm out extras on other accounts. Most of these people doing it hardcore like the guy in OP's picture are probably doing this as their job. The money they gain from even such limited inventory quantities would more than cover another game.
---
It's a small dent for these botfarm dupers/individual dupers. 
---
It's why Bethesda NEEDS to take action for the health of their game. But they don't seem to give a shit because hey, they already got your money. 
---
Seriously, fuck them for this. 76 already had enough of an uphill climb just from promotional prelaunch info. In spite of the fact that other mmo postmortems were plentiful for them to study and avoid, they ran into every single pitfall they possibly could have. It's like they just expected to coast by on the 'pedigree' of their brand.
---
Of course I’m not. In Fallout 4, maybe, because ur was a single player game, but not in an online game. I’m only level 22.
---
Same here, I think I wasted like around 1000 Ultracite Shotgun shells, not even counting other ammo with it. In a good run with 2 or 3 mates without random people, we kill the Queen in max 4minutes or so, we use Prime weapons only, using Psychobuff/tats, Damage Perk Cards maxed out and sharing any other Perk cards to make it even better, I hope they can do something like you said, at least SOMETHING.. Help :(
---
Also speaking as software engineer: 
---
Unless someone did something horribly wrong. It would/should only lag the people trading.
---
You’d need an obscene amount of data to lag the **entire** server.
---
That was fun because it would make it rain hehe 
---
It's not our fault where duping of they cared enough about dumping they would have spent more time making a better game instead of releasing it at the state it was in when it lunched. 
---
Hey man, this devolved into a witch hunt. I'm sorry dude. Wasn't my intent...
---
It'll scale down to lvl 21 once it reaches your base
---
I think we play generally the same way. Haven’t played 76 yet but in 3 and 4 I liked to sneak around collecting stuff, sniping enemies from afar, leveling up and just generally exploring before really diving deeper into the main storyline. Keep playing your game. 
---
100%. Hire some modders from the FO4 community if you have to.
---
Let me be frank.
---
If you like playing in that manner, try Deus Ex: Human Revolution (and if you like that, its sequel, Mankind Divided). Awesome and rewarding for slower players
---
This is what I’d assumed would actually happen.
---
If you’re on Xbox I have one you can have.
---
Is it just me or is the gatling laser anemically slow?
---
I got it at the end of the raider quests and mentally cheered as I had nothing to kill the horde of mutants above my head, only to find out it does like 17 damage and shoots once every second.
---
Built my house outta nothing but super mutant's boards
---
The cheaters are back at it...
---
Or just let us spend atoms to increase it.
---
That's amazing. I'm surprised I've never seen that before.
---
If you duped a stack of books it would physics explode into a strange coily disintegrating book snake. 
---
If you're on Xbox I can go kill them for you if you want lol
---
While I agree with you wholeheartedly, the post would then be removed by the mods for violating the no witch hunting rule.
---
It's better this way. More attention is brought to the issue and the OP can report them to BGS (at least I fucking hope he/she did).
---
Delete the gamertag, there are rules against witchhunting on this sub :)
---
Correct.  4k apiece, less with charisma perks.  But I just got all of them the rad way.  Used the serum only for carnivore, since you can only have that if you don’t have herbivore.
---
Aaahk well in my thread see the youtube video so you know what to look for.

How do you know he was a duper? 
---
If they bite and fail, they'll just nuke you.
---
Just make sure that duping is what's going on. I agree that it needs addressed and stopped but, on the other side just because I drop a bag to give to my teammate at my base does not mean I am duping ( see my other post for my experience with that line of thinking), as much as dupers ruin the game for us regular players overzealous players policing dupers can ruin it as well.

Depends on the critter, some are super chill others aggro randos on sight.

My first explosive weapon was a mutant slaying harpoon gun which is my go to. Then I gave my friend a two shot The Dragon for his Bloodied Explosive laser rifle which surprisingly sucks hard... apparently nothing can fix energy weapons. My third explosove weapon was also my first TSE that I got yesterday.... A two star cryolater from a gutsy and although I've yet to use it, I feel like it'll be helpful with the SBQ
---
Bethesda: *bans people using aesthetic mods*
---
Bethesda: "This is what you want, right?"
---
Bethesda: "Communicating is hard."
---
What system are you on. If your on xbox you should hit up u/onslawter or go to r/falloutbazzar
---
Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I would be absolutely OK if Bethesda's solution to Dupers (after fixing the exploit) was a complete player-wipe and reset of the game. Sure, it would suck having to re-roll (again), but I think all the honest players of the game would understand sooner or later.
---
It's how Blizzard addressed the shit-show that was Diablo 2 hacking. They released a DLC that was basically mandatory if you wanted to continue playing the game because the DLC fixed / deleted all that hacked shit. And you know what? It worked.
---
Take a look at eBay and you'll find your answer. Selling that kind of stuff can be quite lucrative. 
---
Make sure to file a report, RIP to the public server trader economy
---
Do you play Xbox 
---
It depends on what build you are going for. There's no universal distribution.
---
Holy crap man. I’ve never seen this happen before that really sucks. I’d suggest taking out the disk and putting it back in. If you have the game downloaded go onto another game and then go back into Fallout 76, as it causes a force restart and you will switch servers. If this doesn’t work I really hope you figure everything out!
---
Not say him specific was doing it. But I know his gun is a result of it
---
So would like this.
---
Well shit
---
this is unacceptable 
---
It'll never happen, at least not without collateral that'll piss off genuine players. The only way to fix this is to heavily nerf exploding ledgendarys, fix the exploit once and for all, and raise the weapon level cap significantly enough that the current duped guns flooding the market will become ineffective.
---
 Honestly if they implemented level based servers, not only would it prevent making new characters so bloody frustrating, it'd also allow the weapon cap to be boosted way up, maybe even to 100.
---
A) Is this not which hunting?
---
B) How do you know he is a duper?
---
They're awfully desperate to come out on top of a game they don't care about... 
---
Sneaking around and exploring is the only way I play any Fallout or Elder Scrolls game. I love being a thief or sniper. 
---
Thank you for uploading this as a high-res image. It is now my desktop background, as well as copied into my FO76 Photomode folder in hopes it will show up as a loading screen.
---
*fistbump*
---
That's true, does it help to buff your health?
---
No. Muling is exactly why it should not happen.
---
What would that do? From my understanding of the way Bethesda's engine work they would have to assign a new label to that enchantment's slot (like if they moved Never ending from slot 19 to slot 20, they'd have to add a prefix to slot 19 or any weapon that pointed to slot 19 would break the game if it was used?
---
They weren't in a base, middle of nowhere. I agree with what you mean, but the fact they freaked out and logged off immediately means they weren't up to any good
---
you on now?
---
My missile turret and one regular turret started shooting each other, then they started shooting one of my camp walls. Relogging didn't fix it. I stored them then replaced them and they haven't started again so far. 
---
You shouldn't have even hidden their name.
---
What I don't understand is how they arent already banned, like there's no way to run something server side that says hey give me a list of every one that has more than a hundred of a certain bobblehead or 50 of a certain weapon. It's ridiculous.
---
Awesome. Thanks fellow vault dweller!
---
Nah bro pc all the way. :D
---
A)didn't know witch hunting was a thing
---
B)he might not be, but his gun was definitely
---
Well I went back to the game after a few hours and then they started happening quite frequently. Having bad luck with getting decent ones though. Healing Hands probably best I’ve got so far I think 3x. But lost it trying to get other ones. Kinda just want marsupial and be done with it but I’ve yet to get it.
---
Seems buggy at best. Others have reported seeing the prompt when trying to take. I haven't but maybe keep a little left in your budget before you go hunting to be safe
---
Camera is backwards... 
---
He looks like he would use the waster hair, textured forehead, deep jowls (under extras). What kind of build are you doing?
---
Bruh really just said “Cognitive dissonance required to admonish” , what are you trying to prove here , I know you don’t go around saying that so what’s the crack ?

---
Mentions co-op but doesn't say a word about PVP. You're wrong. This was a co-op game that they added PVP. 
---
If it’s hard, they aren’t going to prioritize the fix. They will take the path of least resistance and least overhead 
---
Gotta ask em to untrack the quests, I believe!
---
I use the turrets more as an alarm rather than base-defense. I know damn-well they won't actually kill anything attacking my base, but if I hear them firing at least I know something is attacking my CAMP while I'm crafting.
---
This outfit is the ncr veteran ranger equivalent to me. 
---
Are you sure the gun was duped?  
---
Here some advice.  Who cares.  Duped or not you got played like a fiddle.  
---
Never seen a rando world spawn crab so haven't been able to test it. 
---
You keep saying as designed and intended but its clearly designed and intended to prevent this shit. If this behavior was intended, the game wouldn't have an afk timer at all. The fact that its easily circumvented doesn't mean it isn't there.
---
Well
---
So i was saying they need to swing that ban hammer.
---
So i always found it funny because they are scared to lose their account yet still spout that nonsense.
---
You got the Responders vendors (Charleston &amp; Firehouse, Flatwoods, Morgantown, Grafton, Lewisburg) Raiders (Sutton, Pleasant Valley,) Whitespring Resort, Whitespring Bunker (if you can get in,) Whitespring Station, Harper's Ferry, Watoga Station, Phoenix, and Grahm &amp; Chally. 
---
That's 9 potentially. I think all of those have their own Caps with the exception of maybe the Whitespring Resort and Station being connected but I'm fairly certain they're not. Farm up enough to run them all out of money and that's between 1400 to 1800 Caps in a single go, if you can get into the Bunker and find Grahm and Chally.
---
Anywhere. Just server hop if it's too far from your camp. It'll have to run there otherwise and the wasteland is a dangerous place
---
A friend of mine has the exact same one. Which he admitted he got from a duper, who makes repeated posts about selling duped guns
---
Congrats! You can't play Fallout New Vegas by guns blazing. Sneaking and playing slowly is the only way to survive. You'll get murdered haha I'm more of a scavanger gamer and your exs are trash for harrassing you for your playing style. Why not just let someone enjoy their game?? Its good that you left them though.
---
Provide a screenshot of this if you or anyone has it. 
---
Yeah but that was still just fallout 4
---
Thank man. I’ve tried it all, restarted the save multiple times, went back to try to retrieve the items, but it’s all gone. 
---
The Thru Hiker perk - maxed out - reduces the weight of food and water (including Nuka Colas) by 90% making the weight a non-issue.
---
Not worried. We have many people who are passionate about the game. It’s a discussion. Sticks and stones. 
---
Well not 3k but close enough lol. Yeah I've seen people with over 10k of every flux on them and 100ks of other Junk and they'd just alt f4 if someone tried to attack them lol
---
Unless it’s just me wanting to believe it, which could honestly be true, I have noticed that I’ve been finding more screws and other things that I marked than before. 
---
How so?
---
Thanks man.  They're one of my two favorite guns to.  The gatling gun and the .50 cal are my favorite right now.
---
After they patch out and end dupers and exploiters running around with crazy amounts causing server issues.
---
Would be my guess lol...
---
I agree lol. I’m not even trying to do anything fancy, just doing the main story mission. 
---
True. I can hook you up. I'm on Xbox. Gt is Onslawter
---
Will do! Would love a place with reliable small critter spawns.
---
Hell yeah sister, cheers from Iraq.
---
Muling is exactly why it should happen.
---
Is it me or do battered clipboards sound delicious?
---
If you favor Melee (which is really over powered) go for Strength. Strength also increases carry weight. 
---
Yay  I joined the club.  Welp that was the last straw for me.
---
How do you know it was two shot? How do you know he duped?
---
You sound salty you got baited and lost. Lessons? Don't drop things, and you shouldn't pvp, apparently
---
They might increase it again once they decide it will not affect server performance. But we all know all the servers are about 10 secs from blowing themselves up.
---
Crashing means crashing the server.
---
Upvote 4 teh lulz
---
Yeah I had raider power armor at level 15.  I did quickly outlevel it once I discovered whitesprings though lol
---
Dude, did you watch the video that was in that link, there is a clip of two people in pvp
---
Need one that charges reasonably quick.
---
Playing fo4 recently I found the one in that game can charge 5 shots as fast as you can hit the button. Doing 5 shots in 76 takes forever
---
User error. Maybe not rando spawns, maybe its a story rando spawn which arnt tameable, maybe it wasn't alone. 
---
You're a good man Charlie Brown. 
---
“Let us PvP in the zone to kill the low levels”
---
the OP wasn’t really talking about participation in the event though, he just wanted level 80+ to be allowed to partake in the event, right back at ya pal
---
sorry for the week late reply haha, you dont need to go nuts low hp and use nerd rage, you can still stay at 40% hp to get 2/3 unyielding and do good damage.
---
if you go nerd rage it will be something like this, https://i.imgur.com/pxKvlfw.jpg
---
at a safer 40% hp it looks like this  https://i.imgur.com/DtKnQgT.jpg
---
still absurd damage that 1shots anything on land and 3shots scorchbeasts hehe, take appropriate non power armor resistance perks and you will have almost power armor resists!

The fact this post has been made and reposted a million times this month to the point that 50% of my feed is flooded with it constantly, is out of control.
---
Hit em with the ole razzle dazzle
---
Tbfh, I'm now at level 41 and I would not know how to cheat on anything, because I've honestly been having a blast (ha. See what I did there) getting here. Yes I have to start the game over and over but whatever, online gaming gives online problems. Get over it. 
---
So me, I'll grab another cup of coffee in the time granted to me by Bethesda and then swing in with a super sledge to take on the Queen with just asshairs of damage compared to my other companions. And I'll love it every bit as much as they will. Sharing loot and happy emotes.
---
I love this game &lt;3
---
You got Nuka Cola, Nuka Cherry, Nuka Dark, Nuka Orange, Nuka Wild, Nuka Quantum, Nuka Grape...
---
I think that's about it. I prefer regular, Quantum, and Cherry. 
---
Owl Mask an illicit item that appears to be duped here? How does one acquire it? Same with the white power armor color?
---
Something does not add up. 
---
Is it Bloodied?
---
To bad it’s the only prime receiver I have gotten thus far (sad face) lol. 
---
Now that I have 4 sets, this is a crucial need!!
---
and a bunch of shit from New vegas was directly from 3, your point is meaningless. 
---
If you could dupe atom shop items and sell them this would stop in one second
---
It adds some DR to everything, not exactly sure how much but I get like 10-15 a piece. Never looked for RAD resist though because even if you boost your resist as much as possible and have like 1500 resist you still take tons of rads in nuke zones, so there is no getting around the hazmat/power armor setup for going into a nuke zone.
---
I know people that started alt characters and then just store their items that way. Their main character never carries the tens of millions of carry weight, and whenever they need something, they just move the item from one character to another.
---
Eh. I have 30+ bulk concrete...not sure why its hard to find for some.
---
wow. im sorry man. if you ever need gear hit me up
---
&gt;  I don't rush into things, I sneak literally all over the map and never use Chems. 
---
I think you just described how you should get your next boyfriend.  
---
I believe there should be some sort of balancing yah but that’s how the game is meant and supposed to be
---
either don’t try getting a workshop settlement or turn on pacifist mode 
---
This is probably the most unbalanced and most likely to be the worst ever game published by bethesda even regardless of their PVP system
---
6 of them
---
I use my TSE gatling gun(not duped) and haven't tried prime on it since someone a while back said their TSE .50cal gained negligible bonuses from primed. My old gatlings were primed but idk. So my 5mm is not as big of a loss at all as your 1k+ ultracite shells tbh. I deal 1,240 damage with psychotats and adrenaline up so I doubt primed would benefit me. I'd say they ought to nerf TSE weapons for this but legitimate TSE is rare af unlike the duped TSE's people have currently. I can solo the queen in a split second practically with just two people nearby but that's absolutely never the case anymore as it used to be.
---
My issue is that I want the entire server to benefit from the queen even if they fire one shot at it. Instead, that wastes a nuclear keycard, the time it took to launch the nuke, literal tons in ammo, mats to repair weapons, and lack of loot.
---
Wow...  1 million wood and like 200k-300k of several bobbleheads.  I would seriously put in a ticket with that unedited screen shot.
---
Yes I have done. this but what you are talking about is kinda what I want, but from the ingame options.
---
Killed a legendary feral last night while trying out my new plasma gatling, turned it to goo and was unable to loot anything from it. 
---
I've heard it was a known issue, but didn't even think about when i was doing it
---
Ahhaha aaaah o it would.
---
Yes I did..but I ran out of ammo for the weapons I had so maybe I didn’t damage her enough.  It gave me the event completed prompts but no rewards and she only had 2 lootable items on her.
---
This is why the game should have metric units.
---
Same

Scorched drop them.  Can’t mod.  No real point to crafting?

Yasssss! Loving this! 
---
So thank you all for suggestions and ideas. O have tried all these things and still have this problem. I still believe this is a tech issue within the game.
---
Are you guys roleplaying as secretly evil as well? Just curious.
---
I'm interested in both you guys and The Brotherhood of Steel but ain't sure who is right for me! 
---
Do you guys plan on having chapters/divisions/branches for all platforms??
---
I have to agree.  It seems that Bethesda is no longer worried about fixing the game since it's tanking so hard.  When does The Outer Worlds come out again?  Fall 2019?  Arrg... needs to be sooner, but I'd rather it be 100% done and not be anything near FO76.  Of course they aren't doing a cut/paste from a previous game I'm sure.  :)
---
Crafting a new one each time you level up?
---
It has the worst defence of all pa types (except *lvl15* raider which has the same dr/er as lvl 25 excavator but less rr but if both armor are the same lvl  raider wins) but it has utility.
---
No! That’s a very bad idea!
---
That would mean Bethesda going back on there word saying you won't be able to gain an advantage by buying atoms. They could add a robot vender though to buy stash upgrades from.
---
You should post his name and use this as a in game report
---
I actually wouldn't mind if legendary DMG affixes were only for PvE.
---
Well rested perk and stew from feed the people
---
Ugh. So basically, at Bethesda, this is drawing man power to fix? People who’s time might be spent on fixing smaller bugs and prepping more material. 
---
Tell me they’re catching and banning these people. How hard can it be to find the guy with 8 billion tons of stuff with a query? Send a warning. Then send a ban?
---
Man. I’m bummed. 
---
Why are people pissed at people pvping in pvp zones. Because that's what workshops are. They aren't bullies. They're just playing the game.
---
I would be nice to have a safe way to transfer items to my other chars...since none of my RL friends are playing.
---
It’s a Level 30 1-Star Bloodied DCG, so yes
---
I had a guy with a bounty near my camp.  I was level 50ish and he was 20 or 30ish.  He initiated combat.  He attacked me so fast with a hunting rifle, that the entire screen and ui shook.  I was obliterated in about 4 seconds while unable to move.
---
They only spawn if you haven't completed the robot quest yet. 
---
They wouldn't have spawned for just me. 
---
Actually had pacifist on and still got killed nearly instantly. Couldn't kill the guy taking over cuz the mode was on initially. But yeah. No fun. Had I been more inclined I would've returned again with my mini nukes and just destroyed everything they took over. Next time.
---
Atom store
---
Still runs terribly.. even with great hardware.  if you could stop yourself playing a fallout game in the first place I'm surprised you'd care enough to come back. It's still set in the fallout universe that I get to explore so yeah the its worth it. 
---
Keep waiting if the lure of playing more fallout isn't enough to convince you. It was for me

When 
---
I like it. I go for glass cannon builds in most pvp games, anyhow. but Bethesda should've put some more thought into legendary prefixes, like not making explosive tier 2.
---
workshops are essentially big arenas, so they should function differently. like disabling legendary prefixes. that'd probably be the best solution, allowing op pvp outside of workshops and creating a venue for pvpers.
---
I'd love a .50cal version of my TSE gatling gun to alternate between the two! Sadly, any TSE .50cal on the market would be a dupe. Took so many whitesprings runs to get my gatling in the first place, I don't think I could handle doing anymore for a .50cal haha!
---
YOURE DOING GREAT SWEETIE!!!! 👏👏👏👏
---
No it's not atom skins like hot lods
---
That is exactly what I wanted to say.  Let em roll a new Reddit profile.  Social media is about sharing shit, that includes the shitty behavior of others in a community.
---
I am at bar will leave bar for this 
---
There was a PC mod for multiplayer in System Shock 2 ;) the game was great in single player but was great in multiplayer too.
---
Actually that's an interesting comparison. Hollotapes telling the story (all the people are dead) and the zombie type enemies that remain after. Like the scorched. I think you're onto something there. So Modus Kinda = Xerxes... or maybe Shodan.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if it happens to everyone, bad people around who thinks it’s fun ya
---
You got Power armor Piecemeal?
---
I've been looking for T51b helmet for days.
---
For the first time?
---
Think the next patch comes soon this month. But i dont think stash size will grow yet. They still have crashing issues to deal with. They need to ensure stash size isn't a cause. 
---
Is it? If he crashes the server, wouldn't his partner also crash out and unable to sustain the instance? 
---
Yeah fuck solo players too amirite
---
Same. 
---
I restarted my pc and game, worked fine after.
---
Did this trade ever happen?  Would give me a smile.
---
Or the first time you have logged in today, which is a day included in a list of days you have logged on before?
---
Coming from r/all.
---
Jesus, there are actually people who play this game?
---
It’s great even if you’re not a new player. I am level 29 and super into building bases. Found a 109 at the overseers camp crafting. I needed to fix some armor so I decided to join him and craft also. I emoted at him after we were both done and he dropped me all of his plans and recipes that were extras for him. It really means a lot because getting new tables and beds and other decorations are awesome for people like me who really just enjoy building and making cool stuff. 
---
What lvl you looking for. I have a lvl 30 and a lvl 50
---
Yes. The Social menu seems to disconnect &amp; lag WAY behind. Its truly shit. We always end up having everyone *quit the game entirely* before sending invites from the Main Menu.
---
Like over 10k bobbleheads.... I havent used 1yet.  And i have like 10 of each lol. Stupid dupers. You do that kinda shit in fo4 or singleplayer in general, not multiplayer... Like wtf is the point
---
Aw :-(
---
Next time I play I'll go get a pet and name him "Kenny".
---
Yes, first time today sunday, couldn't play for 2 days
---
Bethesda is based out of the US so we gotta have Murican units or most of us wouldnt know how to read it lmao
---
I think I’m gonna go agility and perception based since i’m looking for a bit of a sneaky guy and then ill put some points into intelligence for the crafting. i’ll probably go with a lot of the pistol perks so i can try and stick with that as the main weapon of choice. 
---
This is old news and been around for awhile so ya know 
---
Good thing you guys broke up. How do they expect you to ever get better at video games if you don't challange yourself.
---
As far as I know there are multiple ways to crash the servers, and one is simply spamming things. It happens to me sometimes and I don't use macros. I assume that's what they mean by crashing, otherwise why use that word? I believe the dupe does involve crashing the actual server but I have not done it. I just know I can tell when a server is about to crash because I can feel the lag  accumulate to a certain point.
---
It’s really easy in this game. You’re practically guaranteed it after 15 hits.
---
From me...I have so many lol
---
The winterized is in game for T51, T60, and I think t45.  So are military paints for them, and all tanks of t60 BoS.  The atom cats is new though.  I’d love to get it if anyone knows.
---
Yeah see, but you don’t know... nor could you from the information gathered.
---
So sick of these delusional masturbatory posts.

This is gonna get me downvoted to hell but it's the 5th of January. A weekend. Literally Tuesday was a holiday. And literally Tuesday before that was Christmas. Can we let Bethesda have two weeks with their families, or catching up on sleep, or the million other things human beings do when not hunched over a screen during weeks and weeks of crunch time? Even considering that, they patched some things after release. Some employees sat there listening to you guys freak the hell out over a game and responded. Can you guys wait until like... idk... the 15th? The 30th? before you grab the flaming pitchforks? I mean, it's a game. You don't HAVE to play a game. But people DO have to take time off work. Calm down and have a little empathy. Play something else for a few weeks. If FO76 still has dupers, then come back and complain.
---
My PSN is rickpenna btw...
---
Ah, yes. The ol’ “I’m to lazy or don’t care enough to explain complicated issues to my child so I will shelter them with arbitrary age-gating so I don’t have to deal with it til they’re older” approach. Classic. While we’re at it, let employ the “Abstinace til marriage is the only way to avoid STDs and pregnancy” tactic. Not only does that avoid awkward conversations, but I’ve heard that nearly completely solved unwanted teen pregnancies.   
---
Or, you know, a parent can get to know their child and make decisions on what is appropriate for their development based on the child’s personal maturity level. 
---
3 Star sickle today lol.
---
Blocking reflect 50% damage to attacker.
---
+10 damage if mutated
---
40% faster swing rate 
---
You should come back to FO76, there's tons to do! You don't have to play it like Fortnite, I spent the first 35 lvls of both my characters primarily in the Forest zone NOT killing lots of things.
---
Stay in the green, foresty area of the map, and there's tons of interesting low-level things to do:
---
Build a CAMP between Billings and Silva homestead. Most mobs are lvl 5 to 10. You can get plenty of xp just by having the Green Thumb perk, picking everything you find, and crafting food/drinks. Plus, having a farm is relaxing, the homesteads have things like power armor, bobbleheads, easy workshop to claim, and plenty of foot traffic from other players. Not everyone playing on your server is a garbage person. I deal with anxiety too and I've made a lot of random friends by just saying hi and offering my freshly-made teas and steaks.
---
When you're feeling adventurous, head over to Point Pleasant. It's all low level Scorched you can kill in a shot or two, and you can find a power armor suit and collect tons of weapons to break down to learn weapon mods.
---
I stayed in the Forest zone for weeks just crafting and exploring and taking my time.
---
Is, not was.
---
I never said you can't enjoy it, but the question is "How has duping not been fixed" the answer is clear.
---
Part of the problem is Bethesda's code. From what I understand instead of the code saying 10 stimpacks or whatever, each stimpack is a separate item. If they can fix that, then we wouldn't have to worry about server stability nearly as much.
---
Someone here posted a list of every item in the game code. 
---
Sorry I suck at answering.  The paints I listed are from the technical data quest.  You have to overbuff luck with Unyielding pieces and chems and stuff to get the drops.
---
Fair enough I didn't know lol its f******* awesome to fly with no suit.. gotta have goat legs ... some of these landings get rough... the descent rate seems inconsistent
---
It's called the ultra sledge and it's fast swing speed too!
---
Damn kids..
---
Title is kinda confusing, fuck cant change it. 
---
I finally started getting multiples after a few hour break. I have Adrenal Reaction, Carnivore and Speed Demon at the moment. I’m scared to keep going and get a crappy one that’ll risk losing a good one if I use Radaway to clear. I’d be happy to stop if I could just get Marsupial. Thinking of taking a break from the plan and getting 2 more ranks of Class Freak in so even if I get a crappy mutation it won’t hurt as much with negative effects.
---
SteelSeries stores macros and lighting settings on the board itself too
---
-_-
---
I’ve been wondering how Bethesda’s going to fix the duping problem. It’s been possible for so long majority of the playerbase has been affected by it, and thousands have duped or received duped items. 
---
Really kills my will to grind anything when people are running around with thousands of the rarest items in the game. 
---
Hell, they're already taking the initiative to do it themselves...A few weeks after launch some god among men created a mod for perk loadouts, and recently somebody made a mod to stop yourself scrapping calibrated shocks and jet packs to repair guns
---
There is a missing category in the workbench which prevents the hats from appearing even though they are unlocked. It doesn't effect the Atom shop hats though. Hopefully the hats and the free states vendor will be fixed soon. 
---
Of course you quit look at your characters face
---
Yup, releasing a buggy, half-finished game that is easily exploited is pretty unacceptable. 
---
And bethesda arent doing single thing about 
---
30 will work. What's the price on it?
---
Not going to give you the view if you can't bother to explain it here.
---
I read the whole thing.  Man I got to say you hit the nail on the head.  I love the game I'm level 55 still haven't completed all the quests because I love the slow crawl of trying to find everything at a location but still somehow fail.  There are tons of things this game brings to the table.  I thought I would hate having to worry about equipment condition along with the survival aspect but I freaking love it.  Maybe I'll see you in the game and we can share some vodka.  Drinks on me.
---
Same.
---
Seriously I see dozens and dozens of these Reddit posts every day with someone claiming they encountered, got over on, or defeated a Duper when playing. 
---
It’s like a bunch of 5th graders tellin stories outside of school. 
---
Any idea when you’ll be launching the nuke?
---
Meh more server space for us peace 
---
my character is lit!
---
I dunno in a game with very little NPCs, it's not a far assumption that whatever is moving wants you dead
---
Security door plan, watoga or the BOS vender can’t remember which.
---
I panicked and scrapped them all. Such a waste. 
---
You're meant to play games, being good at them is optional.
---
Kudos to you for kicking a toxic person out of you life
---
Okay buddy

I moved away. Haven't seen my grandma in almost 2 years now. Sadly by the time I go visit she won't remember who I am (Alzheimer's) 
---
Wtf
---
Just the time to clean site Charlie. I never clocked it....
---
Wait, there's a passive mode? Where?!
---
You were probably holding up the vendor and if you weren't there to trade u ought to find something else to do. He probably tried to tag you just to get you to hurry the fuck up with no thought about the possibility of u having Tesla coils. Which isn't really his concern 
---
Ugh, I would love to be able to easily swap items between characters. One has loads of prime recievers learned, uses melee and has 0 fusion cores. The other uses guns, has tons of fusion cores and would love the extra mats my melee character has stocked up (I'm looking at you screws).
---
&gt;I broke everything near instantly, however, they wouldn't land.
---
This is what happens when you put perks like [White Knight](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/White_Knight) into the game.
---
If your stuff wouldn't break instantly, I wouldn't even have to repair every 20hrs.
---
Sometimes I really wonder how design flaws like this can make it into a AAA game from a dev with decades of experience with rpg mechanics.
---
&gt;  I seriously don't get how it's not getting through your heads. 
---
Implying that people don't know. Regardless of how it was made, people are still fully within their rights to give feedback and want it to be fixed. Knowing how it was made changes literally nothing.

**Hot Rod Station missing**  Bought the Hot Rod Station from the Atomic shop.  Stored my regular power armor station and replaced it as the Hot Rod station...but instead of being placed I set it down, nothing appeared.  Wasn't in "stored" tab. Tried log out/in, still not there. Now I have to spend more components to build another power armor station. Great.
---
Me too. My pan is LazyN1nja.

I'll do 800 because its damaged

To be fair, some of these resources are hard as fuck to come by to maintain your equipment.

its explained in the video
---
Haha 72 in a week is crazy. I wish just had that kinda time. I'm lvl 20 and been playing since beta.
---
I think they should just buff players health in PvP, slap damage at all times, that's PvP motherf**ker!
---
If only we could walk them naked through the street yelling "SHAME!"
---
Oh no :( I hope that's not the only option!
---
Sounds like these dudes have confidence issues. Berating others just to feel better. Everyone should find a promoter in an SO but not an enabler.
---
You want their IP address banned twice? And why Steam content? The game isn't available on Steam, last time I checked. 
---
This glitch is real. Happened to me today and I had triple of all my turrets. Simply just moved my camp.

My graphics drivers are up to date per NVidia and running on their optimized settings. ( I have also reduced everything down to bare bones just in case but no dice). All else in the game looks to be as expected.
---
System should be able to handle it.

Am I missing something? Haven't had any other issues with a Bethesda title before in the graphics department (Usual other issue notwithstanding)

Any help would be appreciated.

I see this too. And I think it slows respawns as well. I go around waiting and loot inert meat and such off all the meat piles. Seems to clean up some and shortly later things respawn.  Also lately I been crafting things and waiting for it to finish it's animation\audio and not get ahead of game. Also read on another thread holo tapes and notes in your inventory can cause issues? They are no weight items and I sometimes forget about them, may start each session with dumping them in a lake somewhere.
---
It does drop in game ive gotten it from workshops
---
lol like 10 people on each server 
---
Not like duping is a problem. If they want to "fix" mules they just need to implement a hard weight limit of like 1k or even 2k, which should be in existence anyways. In fact if the game MERELY HAD a weight limit then at least dupers would be much more limited in the damage they can do. Being able to have 10 million weight is whats breaking the game. Simple as fuck to change, but of course nothing has happened yet!
---
You probably have roo much in storage/ in blueprints?
---
And people downvoting everything I post in here, join the discussion instead of being a d*ck..
---
No fun for players who use the pet to ambush people trying to use ur base
---
Not the security door the one I'm looking for specifically looks like of a jail cell unless that is it
---
Yeah, as I said it needs addressed and dealt with, but there are way to many posts stating ,two people one higher level one usualy lower level standing with a bag between them --dupers!! Get them!! I posted a few days ago re: my experience with this, simply dropping 10 antiseptic for my lower level teammate to make radshield with, and some guy attacking us - grabbed the bag yelling dupers must die!! The whole point of my post is before people take on the mantle of Bethesda police make sure you are not harrassing regular players. That guy got reported to Bethesda and Microsoft for griefing and harrassing.
---
Hardcore mode in new Vegas requires sneaky sneak tactics. Sounds like a douche canoe full of vaginal splooge to me. 
---
wow clickbait title
---
To be fair most people think everything is everyone else does is shit.
---
Male gamers are the same with one of another.
---
Your mistake is assuming it's because they are male and you are female. 
---
i would assume 'low key' childhood drama/trauma "is for children" "Do you really want to be &lt;insert shaming here&gt;" "Grown up do not &lt;insert shaming here&gt;" "And I thought you wanted to be a grown up because &lt;insert shaming&gt; and do/behave &lt;insert demand manipulatively because children are not real people that deserve to be treated like actual peers by parents&gt;.
---
There are a lot of seeds planted in children because parents are lazy at one point or the other and this is something (particularly with comics and similar things) that happens a lot.
---
You launch yet?
---
I have a two shot pump, but not explosive.

That's good news, do you remember what event?

Around 9500 is the cheapest

Should of bought a dildo instead

That's the joke
---
SHAME!
---
Level 123, My build is more of a glass cannon build so my damage is unnaturally high but I die really easily. For my build I've found a max level Grognak with Bloodied legendary can deal 4700 outside of a team and up to 12000 in a team
---
Are you mad modders are fixing Bethesda's game for them?
---
Yep, I play the same way and I'm a dude, I dont see anything wrong with that. We all play game differently and approach them in our own way, what matter is that you're enjoying yourself and have a good time.
---
Doesn't automatically mean every gun that has the same effects is a copy. There are duplicates naturally pumped out by the game mind you. No gun is a "one of" ultimate power blaster of doom
---
Shame shame shammeeeee shame on youuuuuuuu -sing and shakes tambourine-
---
Sure....but waaaaay down the list of things to do. 
---
My daughter did t want to play kid games when she was 7. She went straight for halo. Shes almost 10 now and knows more about borderlands than me. I kinda wanted to get her fallout so we can play together.  Nice to know other people let their kids play and had a good experience. :)
---
Jesus fucking Christ, ban that guy.
---
...exactly the point. 
---
Only solution I've ever found, sadly
---
Rage typing LOL just went to buy a serum from a guy and He had a Stack of 3 \* explosive two shot shotguns in his inventory and 500+ mutation serums. I canceled the trade and reported him on everything I could.  
---
What is this, /r/TwoXChromosomes?
---
I dont remember but i could of sworn it was Poseidon. It also could've been the small version if you think there different idk honestly
---
Definitely huh? So you watched him dupe it then?
---
Castration is a must
---
Really should not because it can count as witch hunting.
---
So i will leave this up for a few mins so you can see what the typical crap response is.

I would love to fight the Queen with 20+ People, always said that from the beginning when I just started.. But, it makes it undo able.. At least if you are not having enough people dealing some decent damage, in my opinion if you cannot kill a normal Scorchbeast within seconds, you cant really help kill the Queen.. Again, would love to see some sort of fix for this.. 
---
Gravel pit right by overseers camp next to the pickup truck.
---
From what I can tell, things stored are counted in your budget. The glitch pushes you way over budget, but you can still place stored things down. You just can't place new things until you delete enough stored stuff.
---
You shouldn’t have blurred his name out and sent his GT to Bethesda.

Go server hopping for an x01 jetpack. Each time you check you can get 3 cap stashes. Checking only takes a few minutes. The one in the guard post below the bunker entrance is almost always there 
---
What do we do with their parts?
---
Yeah I think the small letter one is something else
---
Nah. I put my son on Ultima Online when he was only 8. He LOVED it, got so good at pvp that he could beat me. He's a responsible, hardworking father now.
---
Yeah I hate dupers, but being called one because I legitimately got a TSE lever action and refuse to not use it is getting old.
---
Players in PA appear to be using their Super Sledge with one hand, but it's still a two-handed weapon for Perk's sake.
---
Yes it's at half health
---
I want this so I dont have to stop when pulling up the map, I do where other people are I just dont want to stop moving when I check I'm going the right way
---
&gt;Giving each player the option to make their own instance might hurt it even more.
---
I would think that someone who has thousands of every item makes their own instance and goes to it that it wouldn't lag the main server. While it would still use server power it won't affect any one else until he leaves it. Also, everyone's camp is a separate instance, so it can't be that bad.
---
Fuck yes!!! I call the dick n balls facemask!
---
Ok and do you recommend I keep it or sell it for more caps?
---
In your play, you might not need the extra protection, but lets say you have a glass cannon guns build, then the extra resistances can be a life saver sometimes, and also not everyone needs the hundreds of carry weight, with calibrated shocks on my t-60, i have never been over my carry weight in power armor because first, i have multiple weight reduction perks cuz i collect almost everything, and second, i always scrap and store stuff often so that extra 100 would be useless to me
---
Would you happen to have a link to that thread. If you do I would appreciate it.
---
Should be around 30 mins to clear. Maybe a bit less. I've done alpha many times and its always around 25-30 mins.
---
This is some next level sh*t,
---
'' bethesda makes these glitches on purpose''
---
It will remove a random mutation. There is no way to predict the outcome.
---
Brother taming is another route to raiding. Set up base outside a busy train station. Tame a big critter. When someone comes around to vender, shoot some flairs to get their attention theyll investigate and when they attack your pet theyll flag for pvp and you get first shot. So much free a scrap. 
---
Not for the power armor? I've only found level 25 on the chasis 
---
Well it dons't get anymore fun when you reach level 200+ and loss over 200 cap each time.
---
I think that's a bit far. They have ruined the economy, but I still think that's a bit much.
---
Yep their mind sets are really fucked lol...
---
Well said soldier!
---
Just build bro 
---
And that ex boyfriend's name...? AlBeRt EiNsTeIn
---
prairie oysters anyone?
---
Same.. such a simple fix. Bethesda really screwed up with this release..
---
Yeah I'd love to get my hands on some nice legendary heavy weapons.  I bought a TSE .50 and gatling gun off a guy for 500 each so they were most likely duped, bit they only come out for queen fights were losing because otherwise they ruin the game for me.  So far I've found the AP gatling which is really good and a TS 50 cal that's only lvl 25.
---
If u actually find one it's up to you. It's just really rare and there are cap stashes along the way to finding one.. people would pay a lot but I'd probably only sell one if I already had one.
---
Which I don't 😭
---
I think character inventory and stash inventory should be client side. Have the server snapshot items and compare the items to make sure they're not altered in any way.
---
Evidently you were playing at bad times my servers always maxed lol again thanks for the space
---
Best how so? If you’re talking about legendary effects there are four sets of effects that stand out:
---
Vanguard: +35DR at high HP
---
Unyielding and +1STR(bonus if it has reduced carry weight): gives total of +4STR per piece at low HP, Valued by melee users that use it to max out damage and traders that want better carry weight
---
Unyielding and +1INT: values by crafters since a full set gives +20 INT which boosts crafted items quality
---
Weightless: if all your armor pieces have this then you will be invisible while standing still if you have the chameleon mutation. 
---
Sentinel: take reduced damage while standing still.
---
Press esc or the main menu for whatever platform you are using
---
Open options then go to games, there will be a pacifist mode which rolves around not wanting to participate in any sort of PvP or action in particular 
---
I am sorry, I didn’t bookmark.  :(  search this sub, it had lots of karma.
---
Even if they completely removed crafting from the game, I strongly suspect somebody will develop a new duping method within days.  They have to address the underlying cause(character data storage in the event of crash/lag/desync), or people will just keep finding new ways to do it.  That won't be easy/fast.  Most likely in the near future we'll see another quick fix that prevents current methods, but it won't be the end of it.
---
There is one near the overseers camp.... But I can never find it when I have the required mats for an extractor lol. I wanna say it's between her camp and flatwoods but God dam n if I can find it not on a low level always loot it as I pass tho. The gorge junkyard is a nice spot. I take it occasionally on xbox1 but leave all open with signs say take me for noobs to see. I build it up with water and food and decent defenses unlocked gatherers and all benches any who need to use it or wants to take it is free to do so. GT is same as credit name. 
---
Will do thanks.
---
So can you not turn this player into Bethesda?? Or not hide his identity fuck that guy
---
Lol it’s all good was just saving you some time is all 
---
Once I tried to make my character look like the rock. The only advice I can give is accept that it will take awhile to get it just right. Look from all angles and study a picture closely. Putting the picture under your pillow while you sleep can help. You also need to set it to all backgrounds and screensavers on any device you will see. This way it becomes like the back of your hand. There. See? Now you're ready to create the face of your childhood idol and possible soulmate! :D

It's not really needed at this point, stop to much of the materials and dont keep gear your not using, scrap junk and you have no problem with the stash size.
---
Both come with the security door plans.
---
Mine is too, I wonder if that is the exact cause.
---
Dishonor! Dishonor on you! dishonor on your whole family!!!
---
What’s the going rate for a TS or E shotgun or handmade on Xbox? 
---
They are as shit at being alarms as they are guns. Half the time they don't start shooting until the enemy has walked (not run) behind them
---
I would absolutely take a vampiric attack speed rolling pin again at level 50. Last one I had was level 40, gave it away to a lower level since I never used it.
---
I feel the same way. This game stresses me out quite a bit for a Fallout game. I'd team up with you if you were on PS4!
---
I love this. Why can’t people just acknowledge that everyone plays games differently and that the point of video games is to have fun, not be the best. 
---
It takes 2 minutes max per run if you're doing it right
---
I say wipe their levels back to 1 and make it 50% harder for them to level up... also , no perks because they are not SPECIAL
---
This is so sad
---
Who would even buy them?
---
If you’re XB1 I’ve got a handful. Depends on your build which one would be best for you, unless aesthetic is more important. 
---
is all that shit duped or something?  I haven't played in a week or two but I had my generators and water purifiers get duped accidentally when my camp was moved had like 20 of each when I started with 1. 
---
Was really only mad they kept trying to kill me after I'd conceded the workshop. I didn't care about having it as long as I could finish the defense event in peace and said as much over voice.
---
Exactly, I have over 600 hours in Fallout 4 and I still haven't "finished" the game yet. 
---
There is a way to duplicate your base and get 2 schematics of it thus duping everything inside including turrets. There are youtubers who specifically show how to do it and encourage others to do it if they want assistance killing the scorchbeast queen or use it for defense
---
I just hope bethesda resolves this asap, its getting outta hand
---
play solo lol.
---
maxed? 20 people? lol
---
I felt like shit this week after two dates I went on ended so horribly. I’ve been sitting on my bathroom sink for the last hour wondering what to do with myself but your post inspired me. I’m not going to let some dudes bring me down. I’m going to the fucking mall. 
---
Cheers girl, keep playing! I wish I could play with you, I’m too scared to even try. 
---
Right?! Like maybe hide your base better? Not all of us role-play as Johnny do-goods. That tamed Sloth is nothing but a heavy weapon and screw pinata 
---
K bye
---
Exactly. Issues with bringing Alduin back, I guess.
---
Again ive tamed snallys and deathclaws and do not have wasteland whisperer. Only animal friend is required
---
Get all freaks and you won’t worry.  Empath is the only one bugged, so beware.  Apparently no penalty reduction.  :(
---
Low priority wishlist? Long hairstyles. Back length. That's my only wish.
---
Holy shit, the actual chances of finding the correct box on the entire map are incredibly slim. Damn your friend must know where the dupers are lol.
---
Your exes were bad people, spend some time loveing yourself because you deserve it! I know someone really does care about you ( most likely family ❤). Play games the way you want, and know there is nothing wrong with it!
---
I've been reporting people Duping via Xbox reporting, hoping that will help.
---
Yep thats why these posts are important, constant reminders that each day, week and month left with these gaping wounds do cause more issues for the game.
---
They sound like insecure assholes who belittle anyone who doesn't do things "the right way" meaning the way they do it.
---
But reading this I'm immediately reminded of my sister who has dated no less than 3 men over the past 10 years who treat her like she is stupid, have no respect for her opinions, and anytime she disagrees with them they sit next to her on the couch bitching and complaining and criticizing like they're using their voice as a belt sander on the side of her head until she gives up and agrees.
---
I tried to have a serious discussion with her after #2 about not repeating the mistake of dating that kind of guy...only to see her next bf treat her the same. 
---
Know yourself. We all contribute to the situations we get into in life, we aren't passive bystanders in the development of our relationships, both the good parts and the bad parts. Know that you are making some choices to date the kind of guy who might do this, and you may in some way be allowing, even initiating this behavior.
---
The first time your next bf criticizes your play skill, SLAM THE BRAKES HARD. Let him know that advice is appreciated, but criticizing your intelligence is a deal-breaker, end of story. If he can't treat you as an equal or at least with disagree respectfully, it's time for him to gtfo.  If he can't deal with it, you just saved yourself a lot of grief.
---
But I also had to learn in my marriage, the only person you can truly change is yourself. Identify your own counter-productive behavior and be vigilant on monitoring your own behavior so you don't fall back into old habits. You can't expect them to treat you with respect if you are contributing to the development of the environment where they believe it's acceptable to be dismissive of your opinion. I'm not saying "It's your fault that they do this to you.", I'm saying every human being contributes just as much to the unhappy situations in their lives, just as much as they contribute to the happy ones.
---
Every relationship involves compromise, but never compromise on being treated with respect.
---
Just my two cents.
---
Sorry I was mistaken. Look at my edit
---
People carrying over a certain limit that's not obtainable from normal gameplay should be banned
---
I see, hopefully it will be fixed soon. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Every 10 levels.  You will find plenty.  ;)  So many scorched!
---
I'd go for a complete item wipe, and keep track of which quests we've completed, then give us all the reward items from those quests. That's close enough to being playable.
---
Never exceeded 900 caps!?! 
---
Take extra bulk mats and sell them! Gold and silver net a pretty penny! You can make 1200 caps a day selling to the the bots! 
---
Protip is to have a camp around Fort Defiance as to the west you have a raider bot, watoga bot and BoS bot in Watoga (duh), Free states bot in harpers and responder bots are cheap to fast travel to if you use 76 as a leapfrog. ~~It's been a while so I'm forgetting one vendor faction, but yeah!~~ oh yeah! Whitesprings just to the north! Probably cost you around 200 to fast travel between them all, but still worth it!
---
Congrats man! Have not killed a scorchbeast yet myself.  I just never thought it would be worth the armor and bullets to kill one if im only getting shit drops from it so i just bounce.  Once i get white knight up to rank 3 I will give it a whirl.
---
I believe perks are meant to be randomized but also when reaching level 50 you’ll be receiving even more perks (afaik) so it shouldn’t be a problem to respec that perk
---
I think I got them with 8900 with 6 chr, 3* hardbargain, and grape mentats
---
I still play but far less than I did and Scorchbeasts are probably the biggest reason. They aren't fun. I never feel like I am in danger of actually dying or anything. I have simpacks. I just am going to lose 25 minutes of my life as this thing refuses to land, disappears into the ground as it lays out it's gas attack, and breaks my armor. So then rather than play the game my next hour will be getting back to camp, fixing what i can, and farming springs so I can fix the rest.
---
A scorch beast is at least an hour of my life that I didn't enjoy. It makes me curious why they thought this was good game play. 
---
Good stay gone youtube hate bandwagoner 
---
I'm in too
---
3 bags (give 7 each) spawn near the BoS vendor, as well as a garden gnome above them.
---
The first and only time I used a flamer it broke literally before I could get 30 seconds of use out of it.
---
Brother in (Fallout) arms! 
---
Duping being a player concern for economy seems to be a reddit/forum/pc thing.  At least on PS4 no one gives 2 shits about duping as an economy concern because the entire PS4 economy is cap vendors or a very, very small group of  hardcore players who actually bother with trading.   
---
As a server stability issue that falls entire on Bethesda's head for bad background code/database access.  Individual weapons are one thing but there is no reason a stackable item be it at 1 or 999,999,999 should have ANY effect on server stability/game crashes because it should just be a numeric counter being incremented up/down and have very minimal overhead.  The entire issue comes back to the buggy Fallout 4 engine being used, the bugs are tolerable in a single player environment but to swap an engine not meant for multiplayer that had well known single players bugs to running huge servers was just a bad idea to begin with.
---
Server/game stability needs fixed first and fixing/banning/punishing dupers is not fixing the root cause that is the bad code behind the game to begin with.  Fix the background code, do a sweep through inventories and limit item stack totals to 999 with stacks up to 9999 for things like steel/wood/glass, check for duplicated legendary items rolls in excess of 10 copies of an item and remove any after 10 (post an in game message directing people to read patch notes on initial load screen) , and then move on to bigger issues than people whining about a non existent economy.
---
Dude you would LOVE Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege. It's sneaky sneak sneak. Although there is a shit ton of combat.... on second thought, maybe not. But girl you should totally look into the game even if you don't get it!
---
Ive killed tonnes of scorched and haven't gotten plans ): do you have any?
---
Having a 2 shot handmade with +50% limb damage doesn't hurt either!
---
Update: the scorchbeast queen has been slain
---
you cant doxx on reddit
---
They've probably set their weight limit to an astronomical number too.
---
Put the plans and recipes in the overseer’s camp so that new player can use them
---
...do you really need to ask if someone having thousands of an item was duping?
---
Man, I have had this thought too. Like, I kinda of assumed that was the tactic for it until I realized it wasn't. Why did they not think of that? 
---
Thanks bro
---
Honestly, if the game is letting him do this, I think it's Bethesda's problem, not his.
---
You better wear that hat she knitted you!!!
---
That's why radiation turned them into natures newest meaty beatstick
---
Don't believe the youtube clickbait hate, it's really quite enjoyable.
---
Off him the top of my head...
---
1. One of the Ice Cream places
---
2. Red Rocket Mega Station
---
3. The lumber mill NW of Vault 76
---
4. The sewer under the Chemical Factory
---
5. Roof of a Charleston FD or a a building close by
---
6. Same Ice cream place as #1
---
7. Flatwoods church
---
8. Near Grafton dam
---
9. Sunken boat near Camden Park and Dearhclaw Island
---
10. Portable in Camden Park parking lot
---
11. House near the Thrill of the Grill event golf course.
---
12. ???
---
13. Fort Defiance
---
14. Porch, south of the golf course near Morgantown
---
15. ???
---
16. Roof of one of the mansions near riverside manor.
---
17. Near Morgantown trainyard, I think this one is a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas reference.
---
18. The power station near Watoga that has the death law
---
19. Red Rocket Mega stop
---
20. Chemical plant
---
21. The station near Prime fissure, over looks glass fissure. 
---
22. This mini gnome is near Whiteasprings, I think.
---
May be wrong on a few, when I get a chance to get on the game I will get better locations. 
---
I heard somebody say they found it in a toolbox or lunchbox or something. I've found the small letters set and multiple construction sets inside toolboxes so I wouldn't be surprised
---
Maybe the game shouldn't be such a shitbox that you have to have an extremly low item cap limit to prevent crashing the game? Sure, dupers are cheating but goddamn Bethesda's incompetence is the core of tthtthe issue here.
---
Thank you 🤙
---
I dont know if theyre tamable, I hope its not
---
I start at 3k. But can do deals and what not
---
"Steam related content"
---
Yeah bud you know 100% what you're talking about.
---
There’s player vending machines?
---
lol can tell you didnt watch the video, just got pissed at the title. Fan boy status
---
Living up to your user name I see
---
I just checked - they exist!!
---
oh you are a true hero, truly the paragon of this community lol. calling who out lmao you just posted one guy. hardly what id call calling out the thousands for duping in a game. nice way to karma farm tho, post something like this that this community has been foaming at the mouth over and your guaranteed a couple thousand upvotes. everyone here is basically screaming at a brick wall with all these "BaN dUPeRS!!!!!" posts, people need to realize that bethesda has to rewrite an absolute FUCKTON of code to even get rid of one technique of duping. 
---
And then no one would use them...
---
Did u ever fix this?
---
No it walks back to your camp and then patrols it
---
ditto
---
24 and that is more than enough Keeps the feel isolated and fun again you didn’t like it that is cool..lots of us are loving it so have fun with something else
---
It actually is exactly that. It may not  happen in the trade window, but it does happen if the items are in a bag on the ground. We killed a guy and he dropped a bag with like 16 thousand of a lot of things, and just looking in the bag lagged the hell out of my client.
---
I played FO4 without ever using PA except to take down the Prydwyn.
---
I got to level 50 in 76 and thought... WTF, why don't I just try it.
---
Shoot man. Was yours caused by a bunch of treasure maps as well?
---
Very slightly overboard.
---
But yeah, would be nice to get rid of them. Character wipe at an absolute minimum, temp or maybe even perm ban would be nice too. I don't think IP etc matters since it's the character data that matters, and all of that is stored on bethesda's servers. Also, they won't ban people from spending more money - it actually wouldn't be a terrible idea to ban all the cheaters and have them pay another $60 to play the game again. If they continue cheating, then hell, they get another ban and keep giving bethesda more money...
---
There are friendly cats around so I’m not surprised there are nice dogs 
---
They were in the beta check them out online they are the same ones as outside train stations
---
No, not client side. That just adds one more opportunity for people to mess with the code.  Your suggestion of snapshot of the inventory adds yet another service that would bog down the system and cause instability.  
---
no it's bugged water purifiers I cant place or scrap
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04U7Rd7YV9s
---
Oops.
---
No idea why you got downvoted. Fuck that guy.
---
I will make it my sole purpose to find your base camp and grief any pets you ever take 👏yours and anyone else’s 
---
Nobody was banned for those mods ffs, it was for cheat engine stop spreading false rumours
---
so the reward we get from quests in general is based on our Special stat Luck? Would explain why I feel like i'm cursed
---
Yeah some.guy has made 1500 dollars so far but will probably be sued since its against terms of use like years of jail time bad 
---
Right now. Team is full but i will invite to game.
---
DING DING
---
+1
---
I’ve heard that they’ll be coming up with ways of resolving these problems and the stability with their servers which dupers seem to also cause them to be unstable 
---
hey it’s their fault for not fixing them since the beta tho
---
Or give to someone specifically looking for it
---
Sigh....
---
Suprised there arent more comments about someone actually finding enjoyment in fo76
---
Gott take it up with mods they take witch hunting very serious here. Quick way to get in trouble here man.
---
Ok, so if I was actually alt+tabbing in every 10 minutes to jump around and the game experience for you was functionally identical to if it was a macro would that be fine?
---
If the players don't get to chose how much they sell things for there isn't a market. Unless the players get to chose what they think their items are worth nothing will be bought or sold. The economy builds itself off of purchases from what other players believe are reasonable prices for specific items.
---
Cool, I must have missed that during beta, Australia had horrible hours lol
---
It’s not dupers crashing servers. What a blatant excuse. 
---
The game had server stability issues before anyone knew how to dupe items. I had plenty of the same issues I have today with the first few days of the beta. 
---
You shouldn’t blame the community and start firing at each other, What you should be blaming, is the dog shit server side and piss poor ancient game engine that was never intended or designed to handle 30 simultaneous player characters playing about in the same place. It’s a line you’ve heard before,  but it’s true
---
I’ll probably get downvoted to shit for saying that but Bethesda are well known for being technically inept at times. The amount of bugs in this game are joke and it’s fucking insulting to me that I paid full price for a broken beta product that then dropped down 75 percent of its value in 2 months, what an insult. 
---
It’s a rushed and messy product cobbled together from a previous games assets and horribly ported to an online environment. 
---
I fucking loved Bethesda before the condition this game shipped in was a complete joke. 
---
I don’t feel “grateful” or “thankful” when I see devs fixing the bugs or responding to the community, I feel pissed off they thought they could ship it like this to begin with. They should’ve pulled their head out of their arses and spent longer testing and creating the game.
---
The fact that these exploits exist are a testament to the lazy game testing and lack of awareness about their own product and it’s so fucking sad it’s not funny, it’s just painful 
---
NUKE ON THE WAY!!
---
85, been playing since beta...those 150 &amp; 200+ are the ones that shock me. But I assume most of them grinded nuke zones or did the ole xp glitch back in the day ( a few weeks ago).
---
.308 is easy to accumulate thousands of rounds of. Scorched drop it like rain. 
---
I’m with you here.  We have no guaranteed service level agreement. If Bethesda wants to wash the majority of new users out through disinterest then that action is on their heads by opting not to work. 
---
Yes, it sucks with the timing but it’s their bed to burn. I can wait it out but can Bethesda afford to?
---
Then dont use them pretty soon bethesda will be coming down on dupers and sites like the fo76 market place after that you are walking around peddling your stuff by word of mouth 
---
Thats cool and all but I payed 60 dollars for this game and its a broken mess and I cant get a refund
---
That’s what I’ve been told and I have no reason to doubt it.  I’ve never run higher than 11 so I am in the same boat.
---
Ya thats the unfortunate part
---
Is it ok to use mods? I scrapped 2 x01 jetpacks. This sounds very handy.
---
Oof yeah sorry, area *around* whitesprings is a ghoul infested nightmare, the actual hotel building *interior* is enemy free as long as you don't shoot any of the robots, and has workbenches, shops, and some lore bits
---
Ban the whole Bethesda/psn/XBL account there at least they’ll have to spend more money to be able to play again, even more if it’s on consoles since they will have to re buy gold/Xbox live 
---
It's not against ToS. We have a digital goods category. Though if you want to negatively impact these sellers, buy their items and open an Item not received case. If they can't prove they provided the item,  they have to refund. Digital goods are not typically covered by the money back guarantee but it gets overlooked a majority of the time. 
---
An item not received impacts their seller performance which means more fees. A refund means they're hit with double the fees with PayPal and you get all your money back.
---
I don’t even comprehend why the hell they would be mad about your play style. It’s a game for fucks sake, you’re supposed to have fun with it as you want. 
---
I feel there is a large portion of the story missing. You don't just die from random stray bullets from other players in fallout 76. 
---
That is unless one, you're using a explosive weapon and not really in pacifist mode.
---
OR
---
The second time it happened and you turned on pacifist mode {Shit you should do as a common courtesy anytime you go into a nuke zone} You did so AFTER gaining a bounty.
---
That is how pvp works. You don't "just die" to a stray player bullet. Again unless you've got a bounty.
---
NEXT UPDATE, MAP HOTFIX.
---
That's suspiciously just under 256...so it's either the result of doubling and doubling and doubling (etc) or they've modified a hex 0x0001 to be a 0x0100.
---
What I do is log in log out at watoga station I get them more often there level 15 seems to be a better lvl for some people 
---
GoT u FaMz
---
Are you sure? Because i could have sworn. I've been there alone and killed legendaries. And the nonrobot one in emergency definitely spawns.
---
I leave them in the blue suitcase in watoga station. As a habit I now check all blue suitcases I find in the world now. That suitcase is weirdly popular for this. Found all sorts of shit I'm there 
---
PvP doesn't equal bullying or griefing or toxicity.
---
If this is the way they are handling things... 
---
Breaking things into multiple objects is much better...
---
Each object keeps track of its own statistics, with something overseeing each thing. 
---
EG: 
---
A (Map block)Main Director
---
    
---
    1. Mob 1
---
    2. Mob 2
---
    3. Mob 3
---
    4. Player 1
---
         Inventory
---
         Quests
---
         
---
This would repeat for each block of the map. So each director has a table to keep track of these objects.
---
(Director has this many mobs in play and this many players.)
---
Mob has its own inventory and loot table and mob specific details. Its last location and where it can go. 
---
The player has its own table in which stores its inventory, equip, quests etc. 
---
The mob tracks who is shooting has damaged it and for much which would be tied to the player id whose table would supply dmg and resistance values etc. 
---
Not the best example I'm sure but, it gets the point across. 
---
When you have something accessing a table and actively changing data there is a possibility of a lock. It does this to protect the row of data from changes until its completed adding in its own changes. (At least in SQL)
---
Your character is “lit”
---
I'm just saying they will not do that and it's silly to think they will.
---
They may come down on dupers but there is no problem with the market place. Don't be salty because you don't know how to deal.
---
Yeah, CHR gives you better prices. I think grape mentats dont work as well as they are intended to. The description says it gives +5 _and_ better prices, but it seems like the only barter buff is from the charisma increase. Saw some posts on this sub describing the same thing.
---
Probably couldve drank some booze to help a little more
---
To my understanding, 1 perk can be chosen at each level up, except for perk packs, whose contents are random. That being said, some perks require levels. Class Freak requires level 46 to show up in the perk section. I thought that it will show up once you hit that level, but my friends isn't.
---
Yeah if you keep these perks active you'll be swimming in chems, food and bullets. 
---
but that takes 9 luck slots
---
It's just so painfully obvious you've never fought the queen to understand his frustration. People say things they don't mean all the time. Have you never said "I hate you" to someone you love before? Don't be such a smug dingleberry. 
---
They need some Tegridy.
---
Dang you sound awesome to play with. Playing games is pointless if you just try to rush to the end. What platform do you play on?
---
If you want to much for it chances are people wont buy it anyway especially all the people that dont grind as hard or just starting this caters to everyone if you think its not enough do a private trade no one is stopping people from putting up signs saying have better stuff for more cost only private trade
---
We should all collectively submit this image as a support ticket to Bethesda
---
Exactly.  The ts .50 would be great if I could level it up to a lvl 45 version.  TSE  is a bit much for me for an every day weapon.
---
Request sent to tolken. Psn kabulo_micha
---
I CAN ONLY HALF READ THAT, SHIT
---
This is exactly the problem. Snowflake culture has killed the creative industries. You're fired.
---
I've gotten 8700-8800 ish with hard bargain and an unyielding set
---
Bomb it. Repairing all them turrets ain't gonna be cheap. 
---
No witchhunting
---
Nah, nothing will happen to him. Bethesda already has enough bad press, they don't want a headline that says "poor victim of the Internet is jailed for innocently selling game items on Ebay".
---
A suggestion to at least curtail this sort of thing:  If you go 100 pounds over your limit, you begin dropping random items in random quantities.  Call it the "Your hands are full!" mechanic.  Also make it so dropped items are instanced and other players can't see them.  Want to trade?  Open a trade window.
---
No
---
Probably should have waited to buy...
---
If low levels want to get carried they can boot up a twitch stream of a SBQ fight. Same experience, you get to watch someone else play the game.
---
Some people just don't understand. They want to be snowflakes in a land of assholes, lol.
---
Most use multiple accounts at the same time so they can store stuff on a mule character to trade with others and not be caught with a stack of legendary 2 shot shotguns. Yes they had legendarys in a stack!  
---
It’s not Witch hunting if we have to provide proof? And Bethesda would then have to go and verify by simply checking the players inventory. We have no real power. 
---
Yeah innocently if only when you sell a package of 10 of the same gun for 44 bucks plus 10000 caps something ain't right they've had legal battles like this before 
---
I appreciate the heads up.  Yeah, I've seen several times where folk are saying that levels 15-25 seem to be "the hot spot" for vendor drops.  
---
That's whats got me worried now that I'm 32 and have literately been doing this since I was first eligible to look for it.
---
I might have to start another character.  :|
---
Bogtown workshop. There is a building with 3 floors. Second floor has like 10 bags of cement.  The building is across the street from a police station
---
I dont use the market place at all i play the game and get my own stuff i dont want handouts other people might and you stating that im salty and dont know how to deal you are prob one of the guys overcharging
---
I have one on XBox.  Willing to trade.  Looking for Forest Camo Jumpsuit!
---
You craft 300 boards to lag the server or something like that...they weren't duping the boards...it all seems like a waste of play time to me
---
I love it. I'm in my low hundreds and it is my go to armor. It doesn't offer the defense the others do but it's utility is indispensable. Aside from a gross amount of carry weight it gives you bonus ores when mining.
---
Well you may ask, "But Diesel, why would I be mining?"
---
Ammo young vault dweller. There is a special spot that few know where the lead is bountiful. By time I clear it out and use chemist along with super duper to smelt it I usually have well over 2600 lead scrap. It's not lead I'm ever short on it is steel.
---
No witch hunting ×2
---
Ok im seeing the possibilities now. Must be a Bobble head for charisma as well
---
Morgantown airport 
---
I paid 60 and like I said love it so you win some and lose some 😂 
---
Agreed.
---
Yea. You are misinformed. I was a part of Blizzard Games group for a number of years. It got less and less active and then died. I kept up with them on facebook but every other group they linked me to was dead.
---
I am unsure why.
---
If it checks the items one time upon loading the game instead of having to store every item, that should reduce the lag if it already has to load every item and retain it constantly in the meantime. If the game can tell if the items have been altered, what difference does it make if people can "mess" with the code? All the players with thousands of pounds worth of stuff on their mule characters dragging down servers would just drag down their own system if all the servers have to do is look at the items ONE time instead of constantly.
---
That’s why we provide proof not just a gamer ID. 
---
YOUTUBERS WHY DID YOU DO THIS
---
Wait did you say... witch hunt? **grabs torch and pitchfork**
---
One can only hope, because this is a pure scam.
---
It's only on sale today in the atomic shop. So strike while the iron isn't melting...
---
&gt; Who cares if they're pissed, a minority of people are ruining the fun for a majority of people because of their own greed.
---
&gt; Screw them.

Dude.  WHERE is that fireman outfit?!  The blue one, not the Firebreather one.  Ice been looking for it since launch.  I've heard that it's a random drop from Responder events but I've never gotten one.  Also not really feeling making alts to try and get it from low lvl quests I did two months ago.  Please, please tell me I can find it in world.
---
I'm confused. Did you mean to call him a smug dingleberry? And I've fought the queen several times now and agree with him. So, why don't you try actually making a counter argument instead of an ad hominem?
---
Though I agree that there will be people asking for a lot in return for certain things, the market builds up from what people are selling. If you can't sell a shotgun for 2k caps chances are you realize it isn't worth that amount, so you will lower the price. The point of having a place for many people to buy goods from others is that they don't have to go person to person looking for what they need, and can find it much easier. 
---
105, still messing around.
---
With hunters always have “proof”
---
Beth can do a better job at finding than you anyway.
---
hmm, sounds to be weird because for certain perks for me were also meant to be unlocked at a certain level(achieved) but they just seem to not properly or their s.p.e.c.i.a.l system to function as it should
---
Nevertheless I just think that they are randomized by experiencr
---
What if you kill a super and take his stuff? Permanent ban? 
---
Same. It’s like there are now two terrible hordes out there we have to dislike for shit activities. The duper’s and the fake news kids. Funniest part for me is, I’ve yet to be bothered by a duper, but these constant posts are always annoying me daily. 
---
:O I'll check it out now.
---
Yeah cause they’ve really improved the game since launch /s 
---
Frankly, after the honeymoon phase wears out, it can get incredibly annoying to crash for the 4th time, after you launch a nuke, in one day. Yes, if I had friends on the server I'd rejoin them - if any of my friends still played; but, that's just not the way the cookie has crumbled. There just comes a time when the bad outweighs the good. I'm glad you're not there and I hope you never reach it! 
---
That said, big thanks to the random PS4 fellows I teamed up with in whitesprings. Not a word was spoken but as soon as I crashed I had a notification pop up adding me as a friend. If anyone seems like they dc I do the same exact thing now! 
---
Did you just admit to duping? If you did you poor poor fool
---
Who gives a fuck if you're "bad" at Games, they're there for our enjoyment, my Wife plays Games with me, I got her hooked back in 2009 playing Halo and Gears of War Co-op with me, we still play together from time to time, she's a child care worker now and I'm a stay at home dad so our schedules don't line up much, either she's asleep as soon as she gets home or I'm already half dead from a long day of cleaning and taking care of our 3yro Son but what I'm trying to say is, people who mock other people at gaming are not truly gamers, I couldn't give a flying fuck if you die every second, I'd party up and play, he'll, I'd probably bloody be as "bad", lol, anyway, glad you got rid of the toxic shit and got yourself the Game, good job on the Scorch Beast kill and I hope you have many more amazing gaming experiences in the future!

Drop unused ammo, you’ll always be able to find or craft more

The goal of the Appalachian Division of the Enclave is to assist the oppressed peoples of Appalachia by any means necessary. It is a group of patriots devoted to the rebuilding of a prosperous and secure America.
---
The Enclave is the last remaining bastion of pre-war American Government and Military, and as such, is not only Appalachia's best hope of rebuilding, but the Nations'.
---
As for the idea of the Enclave being evil: sacrifices must often be made in the name of greater good. The wasteland is a dangerous place, and we can't forget that. Our actions now and for generations to come will be in the best interest of our nation.
---
This aged well hahaha.
---
 Such a stupid post in the first place. As if a screenshot can show you how good the game looks and feels.  /u/MyN4meIsChef 
---
Yea but is it actually in the game right now though 
---
Unfortunately, I don't remember where I got it from. I have a feeling maybe it was a Morgantown Airport event? But I could be wrong. It was already in my stash before I started roleplaying as a Fire Breather. You know ... there's even a [white helmet!](https://imgur.com/a/GPd2wuW) 
---
In the same. Not the best, play how I want. I’m level 37 and have yet to take one down on my own. My current boyfriend is really lovely though and we play together every day. Good on you girl!

---
I don't mind it since the TSE gatling is inaccurate as can be haha, still takes a couple shots to hit enemies a lot of times. Now mine dealing over 1k damage is a bit much but all the same, still have to be able to hit the target haha. TS .50cal is just as inaccurate iirc, friend has a lvl 45 TS one and can't even hit things point blank with it xD
---
No idea what game this is but nice 👍🏾 she overcame her challenges 
---
My opinion is that you shouldn't make a new topic about the same subject a few hours after the original was downvoted to hell.
---
If you think theres duping going on go smack a mannequin, they load on each other. If it poofs into 2 then leave the server.
---
I ran into a pre-teen kid the other day who was fresh out of the vault, sounded like he was eight or ten. Showed him how to do a few things, how to read plans/recipes, how to make sure he scrapped all his junk. Escorted him to the Overseer's Camp, then down to Flatwoods to do his first quests. Then patted him on the head and went on my way.
---
I wouldn't dump my kid in a game to learn it alone, but since some people do, I figured I'd be a good grandma and teach him how to bake Fallout cookies. As you do, ya know.
---
Lulz. 
---
Who the fuck dupes Bobbleheads? Of all the things you could dupe why would you dupe the most useless aid items
---
they must have changed their policy in the past year or so, then. last I knew it wasn't allowed 
---
Your reasoning is lost on Young420...  
---
Also, why do people feel that they have to announce they are quiting a game? 
---
Didn’t, sorry, and didn’t know the rule - sorry for even suggesting it.
---
Probably find people on reddit that are interested in playing together then invite them to your server. 
---
Trying to do this in game would be tough. I’d think you’d be limited to people who are going around doing events or nukes with other players. 
---
By the way here is another location.

What are those technical data things for? I've been grabbing them whenever I saw one, but I haven't found a use for them yet. Bos quest or something? 
---
Holy fuck...tldr this motherfucker
---
Yes today has been so bad I gave up and went to Overwatch
---
Yeah, I over change at points. But that's supply and demand. If someone wants to pay 7k caps for a prime plan or ultracite plan that is on their demand. 
---
But I'm also the one who will wait for the perfect price, buying or selling. 
---
And I said your salty because you are. You avoid the market probably because you don't have the patience to wait out a deal so all you end up with is people who over charge you.
---
I'm deliberately leaving the details ambiguous.  What I've described is the principal, not the exact implementation.
---
However, yes, duping -is- causing lag issues for other players.
---
I will leave it up for 2 mins and yeah bro its technically witch hunting and a very big no no here.

&gt;I've been a game developer for 23 years.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Throw them under the bus. Zero fucks given. They keep crashing the servers its annoying 
---
Thanks for the advice. I think that’s the best plan considering how many hours I’ve been playing chance for 3 mutations lol.
---
The only people that would disagree with this are dupers
---
I hope your supply power to these extractors....
---
Because they're looking for attention, which we've given him. So I guess he wins. 
---
known issue
---
Damn, how do you get yours up to 1k damage?
---
thanks rtgus

Something something, they can't take their time on something... that's why they are ex-boyfriends.

Fucking dupes. To lazy to actually get things.

Are you playing on Xbox 360? That screenshot is pretty low quality.

Was I relpying to your comment or his? Use that big brain to think before commenting. 
---
What's the point in debating when we're obviously not going to get anywhere. You have your way of thinking and I have mine. OP's post was obviously made in frustration and that's ok. The problem comes when you purposefully misinterpret it instead of trying to understand the frustration of OP. 
---
Poseidon energy plant. After you set up the concrete, aluminum, lead and nuclear extractors and put down some turrets, go do the power up Poseidon plant if the event pops up. You'll eventually get the fusion generator plan from doing 3 power plant events
---
Yes, they were chugging away just fine with more power than even needed, because at first that's what I thought the problem was as well.
---
Lol, I love this game, but dude, please go outside.  We're concerned.

Anyone who is 50+ picking on a low level teens is a fucking bully and should be dealt swift justice and reminded there is always a bigger fish in this pond. I have myself done this. Hopped on my 115 heavy weapon guy and lit up the flamer and roasted many a bullies world's up. Roast them there camps even a car once. No fuck s given
---
Devils advocate slightly, coming from WoW, expression was "exploit early, exploit often"
---
I don't exploit unless it can be seen as fun or crazy for both parties involved. Game breaking and economy breaking ain't cool tho.
---
I use the black cowboy hat. The wool hat or ushanka is another good option.

You are unequivocally incorrect.

Just because you've not seen something does not mean it does not exist.

Inside the Fallout 76 game files, the paints can be found on the table:
---
LL\_Armor\_PowerArmor\_T60\_Mods\_BoS\_Materials \[LVLI:001B200B\]
---
Which is a child of
---
LLS\_BoS\_QuestRewards\_Clothes \[LVLI:0050E3FA\]
---
Which is a Child of
---
LLS\_BoS\_Event\_QuestRewards \[LVLI:0050E3FB\]
---
Which is a Child of the Parent quest
---
BoSZ01 "Forbidden Knowledge" \[QUST:0010D89F\]
---
**ALL OF THE BOS Paints are on that table.**
---
&gt;That's the exact reason why I wish they'd add a function to modify the level on gear.
---
For that not to kill the whole gearing up mechanic (and most of the fun) it would have to involve another mechanic that produces fun and needs time. And at that point, why not use the already existing and working mechanic to acquire it again?
---
you can trade them in for chances at outfits, linings, paints and caps
---
If you used Bandolier, they would be weightless...I have almost 4k and I'll occasionally move over to my .38 combat rifle to conserve more precious ammo.
---
Yes talons does too.    Any “unarmed” weapons including gauntlets 
---
Im also trying to understand why that is, I really do. What is wrong with looking for a solution to the problem? Not being able to play decent End Game because of low levels joining the Area, so the Queen is almost impossible to kill, that is just messed up. Its like gambling at the moment lol.
---
Personally think luck should not be tied to loot. Games that tie stats to gear drops tend to ALWAYS run into this problem.
---
Though to be fair it's all RNG .. I get shit on my low luck character and shit on my 15 luck character. I personally don't give a fuck about a legendary weapon .. if I find one cool. But I'm not going to sweat over it.
---
I mean hell ... my gurellia character ... a AUTO PISTOL user .. can kill scorch beast with a pipe auto pistol .... non legendary.
---
There is more to your post but honestly I could only bother with the TLDR.
---
I nuke my own C.A.M.P. I like how it looks.

Absolutely agree with all of that the main point im trying to get across is the more people are left to contol the more they will be able to exploit by giving no control to the players there is less chance of exploiting 
---
Just kidding lol, I saw a level 368 but I'm level 56

There is a world of difference between 400,000 bobble heads of each type, and have a couple hundred (which I do have) and 4 mules with atleast 20,000 burden on each.
---
No duping, but I do have scrap in the hundreds of thousands, if not closing on the millions, of each type
---
I’m def leaning on items that actually matter. Guns/armor of legendary status at the least. No need to id basic gathering items
---
Ah OK, I'll keep collecting them then. Where do you have to bring them though? I'm mostly just exploring a bit or scavenging for supplies, so I have a feeling I'm way behind everyone else with discovering stuff. 
---
Done.
---
I just picked up the 2 shot combat shotgun got it to +200 with mods and I thought the 0 accuracy was a bug but turns out it's not, you have to be 2 feet from something to kill it with 4 shots and I'm talking about just lvl 28 ghouls.  Dunno what up with this pile of g a r b a g e but it will be sold tomorrow soon as my pittance 200 caps 'allowance' is unlocked.
---
The servers aren’t normal. I’ve crashed two of my last three silo runs and the third I launched the nuke then crashed five mins later after the blast. That isn’t even counting all the other blue-screens I get.
---
How do people not know there are 9 million other posts already made about this topic this week that they can comment on &amp;zero-share this information? 
---
This is ancient news.
---
I think you need to work on the presentation of your argument. Your previous post was about "rage quitting" because of this issue. That kind of poisons the well of rational problem solving. 
---
There are lots of people who Check the store daily, including me, it was never there
---
Just make a team of 10, trick or bully the low levels off the server. Do three runs then rinse and repeat. Till B actually makes private servers this is all we have.
---
2 boyfriends at the same time? kinky shit.
---
I don't think a dirty suit would do. I suggest saving up 800 Adams for the black and white tuxedos. I think that's the closest wardrobe you can get at this point.

My alloy metal chest piece is giving me approximately 116 DR.  I'll have to double check.  Probably from UNYIELDING.  
---
My total DR right now is 377.  That could be from having a complete UNYIELDING SET.  
---
Watoga makes me think of fo3 a little bit
---
Cheers to you, I'm not very efficient at writing posts and thats true. The post itself contains information of how to be the most meta it currently is possible so, you know, feel free not to read it :D  
---
But on the other hand, as a person who loots each monster twice, once from level 160, 15 luck character, once from level 20, 3 luck character, I must say that the drops I receive from level \~20 are consistently better than the ones I get from my main character.
---
I've never once used Chems in any fallout game. Pretty sure I'm a hella minority. 
---
If you harvest the pile yourself you get items you can scrap but I'm pretty sure extractors have always given raw material.
---
I was such an idiot lol i could of just shown ya via message....
---
My bad 
---
Yeah, yesterday I saw two instigating grognak axes in a stack at a vendor. Three star instigating grognak axes. 
---
I don't disagree dupers should be banned, but the OP removed the line about banning anyone with more than 100,000 of any one item, which is what I called him out on.
---
I am not sure about that. 
---
But I am fairly certain that you would be able to find people if you made a post about it. 
---
You can get it under 8800 according to some players.
---
Visibility, my friend. Apparently, we need 9 million more.
---
Because RNG would probably never allow me to get another weapon that I respecc'd 30levels for. Having to hunt down gear that you already have just gets boring. That's the same thing as making fetch quests and saying it's time consuming and thus it must be fun. While farming gear and getting new gear is definitely the best part, having to drop your favorite gear because it can't be viable due to an imaginary number is never fun.
---
I can craft items of various levels, why can't I do the same to existing ones?
---
I was at low health due to being surrounded by high level glowing ones and lacklustre gear
---
Yeah thought about that later.. Not the best titel to choose, I admit.
---
This is overkill.  
---
I would just dupe nuka cola for caps, and buy weapon/armour plans and food recipes.  I'd rather just craft everything with the plans I buy or find.  
---
Just so you know I saw a flamer mod for the chainsaw. It was either Charleston or Harper's Ferry.
---
How about you just let B get to it when they get to it. Stop witch hunting.
---
I get the supply and demand and i agree with that 100% but more you leave in the hands of the player the more they will exploit the heck out of it and as for patients i have plenty just none to sit and wait for all the greedy s.o.b's to come down in price im to busy playing the game around my work schedule
---
My several hundred thousand scrap steel is all legit...
---
Just because I horde, and take the time to slow walk to my mules doesn't give anyone the right to ban me, because you feel having more than 100,000 of anything is a bannable offense.
---
I don't believe it can be considered and exploit. If you look at games, with I'm going to assume similar markets to the ones being introduced, like dead frontiers marlet. Then you see the market fluactuates with what players sell, and cost change hourly. So yeah some people will try to get some big bucks out of the market but most likely than not they won't be scamming anyone, especially if the other player buying it is purchasing it because they feel its a reasonable price, and if not they can just wait until someone else adds another of it for cheaper. So my main point is if you give control of the market to the players it will grow on its own to its own unique form, but of course since trading is still an option you can always barter with the person as long as they're online 
---
How do you "steal" from someone? Lmao
---
It was a explosive shotgun I think
---
No doubt, wow. I would never pay real money, but I guess there are many that would else it would be as popular .. damn
---
Nah, go straight to SF and steal the gauss! Damage before defense every time! 
---
I got mine at lvl 75 or so from prison patrol
---
If ur on Xbox I'll take some
---
So I have an idea, is it possible to go even higher with the perk that raises damage output for 30 seconds after each kill or even higher if you have furious on a weapon? I know it's not actually able to be calculated in a showable way but there's potential. 
---
We called the OP out on another nonsense rage post, and he is trying to regain the momentum. 
---
I can try and get a screenshot to where my house is tomorrow, they always spawn right in the centre of the house. 
---
Except the suggestion is for weight perks to affect you and the stash when equipped and just the stash when not equipped. 
---
I wondered the same. I'm thinking it would be potential mining sites so probably ore locations? Someone will have a solid answer here for you.
---
Just have fun with it. Only garbage human beings take that much pride in gaming skills while putting.others down.
---
But like I explained in other responses, im trying to find a solution, and hear about other peoples opinions. Im not just being angry and trash talking..
---
if you are looking for plastic for shotgun shells (it's what i am constantly on the lookout for it for), then head to blackwater mine, and also the station at welch, the mole miners at both locations often use shotguns and drop shells.  
---
the highschool is good, as many have mentioned.  Tyler county fair grounds has a building that has a bunch of pumpkin baskets as well.
---
whitesprings in the shops lots of golf balls that turn into plastic,  and any nuka cola cups with straw  (they don't all have straws), give a plastic as well, found around camden park, wally world, and the tyler county fairgrounds.  
---
if you haven't yet, make sure to mark plastic for searching, so you get the little icon if any of the junk you look at has plastic, makes it much easier to find. 
---
lol then dont trade with dupers
---
Woah dude, did not at all realize that there aren't any in this game. 
---
Would also be great if our characters looked a little better overall.
---
Sorry if I’ve lost confidence in their developers 
---
289dmg without any perks
---
This kind of stuff, is the only thing that saves fallout 76 for me. The problems this game has are immense and are annoying as all hell. However, the pleasure I get when, running past a lower level and seeing them struggling, only to help them out. Then teaming up and conquering the map with them is just amazing. Nothing gave me that pleasure like fallout does.
---
Exactly my thought process too lol. 
---
They said atom are purely for cosmetics and there won't be any advantage to getting them. That means if you can spend atoms to upgrade storage atoms would no longer be for just cosmetics.
---
I keep coming back to this list, I have it bookmarked. Thanks, OP. 
---
Sounds like a personal problem...
---
I just figured yellow are garahan run locals and the red are the competition. 
---
I do know that, thank you.  Every time I see someone with one, they cant remember where they got it.  Its gotta be responder events.  It rekindles my desire to search every time, so that is for the info.  I feel like Ahab, constantly searching for my white whale.  
---
Officially they do not endorse any, but it's pretty clear by now that they are fine with mods as long as they are not cheating. I believe their official response basically just hinted that if you screw up your game, they're not going to help you fix it
---
I believe it's similar to a DDoS attack - where due to client side code and the architecture &amp; design of the software (in this case a video game) it simply isn't optimized to be an MMO and thus a client may be able to bring down a server single handedly by duping and leaving hundreds of thousands of objects inside of containers throughout the world - connecting and disconnecting - dropping more and more - friends joining to trade or pick up and leave again... That's just my opinion. I was thinking about sniffing these network packets at some point to get an understanding of just how often the game has to communicate back to the server and what kind of data is being sent around.
---
Fake news.
---
tldr he wants an account wide stash for the little people that aren't on his cheeto and mountain dew smoothie level of hardcore gaming. xD
---
The servers can process GHz speeds, and they're lagging from a human's ability to press a keyboard at, what, 6-7 Hz?  
---
Maybe if they had a macro running this, sure.  But if this was the case, wouldn't firing a fully-auto weapon do so as the bullet inventory was altered at much faster than that?
---
Yeah I feel you, thought and heared about that "solution" but its not the way to go for us, its just sad Beth didnt think about this, I hope for Private servers, would love it
---
Oh I have no idea. I've seen some white nameplates on several scorchbeast but most consistently around abandoned bog town workshop. Lol 
---
How come you make sounds and not die?  
---
Btw. this post of a "fucking idiot" contains information that, if you would be able to comprehend more than four letters at once, would redefine your farming techniques. But keep being a rude and ignorant person that initiates discussion by calling people motherfucker.
---
I'm level 66 and I still don't really know anything and have done like 15 quests, sounds like the sub for me.
---
If Bethesda was interested they could easily pull the character inventories for 5000000 TSE weapons. Then ban all.
---
I mean, no? 
---
Heavy Weapons are some of the lightest in the game if you're a heavy weapons player. 
---
Compare that to a rifle player. My rifles weight close to 20 each. 
---
Grade A douche

"If someone is dumb enough to put their PA on a workbench" 
---
How else would you build/repair it?
---
This would make sense, since it's always October.
---
Man you really like thinking about him a lot lol
---
If you look at the balancing in previous bethesda games since oblivion, letting players become immortal killing machines has always been their clear goal and many players are actively looking for that experience to fulfil their power fantasies.
---
Of course that is completely incompatible with PVP, you just end up with who oneshots first.
---
They try too hard to emulate most of the appeal of their singleplayer sandboxes to come up with anything decent for an online game with pvp.
---
One solution I have seen from other devs is adding pvp-scaling, but that would require going over any combination of item+perk in the game every single time you make changes to your game. Yeah, stuff like that is what passionate indie devs would do, not bethesda looking for money, sadly.
---
So IDK if this is by design or broken but half the barrels increase damage by like 3 but drop the rate of fire by like 230 effectively cutting your DPS rediculously, and the kicker is its less accurate. There is no benefit from the higher damage barrels. But even if you don't fall for that trap the DPS is pretty shit and it break way too quick to be worth it yet.
---
from my understanding they’ll first be dealing with dupers which are their root of almost every server instability out there
---
I personally have encountered dupers and mostly all of them have caused a severe latency fuck up
---
Bethesda are dumb, not stupid
---
They could come up with game changing ideas but they just critically sound to be lazy after all
---
If i was to be a bethesda employee then I’d start dealing and resolving all of the havoc caused by duplicators 
---
It could be. Or maybe I’m tired of waiting for game breaking exploits to be fixed, for a product I’ve paid for. I know I’m not alone of that.

I’m just coming to say that this happened to me today so the glitch is still in the game. If you run up to deposit the ingredients and mash x too quickly, your ammo will show up for a quick sec as an option to deposit and if you’re mashing x it will take your ammo with no way to get it back. Lost 1200+ .45 ammo and had to finish the event with my melee weapon. This event left me sour after. I’m level 87 and it was my first time doing it. Can’t even imagine how many people this happened to that don’t even post on reddit. Or maybe didn’t even notice it happened. 
---
He was probably looking for a potential partner in crime.
---
May you have great success in your endeavors you filthy casual. 😁
---
50 shades of fallout. 😹😹
---
Gt is Leekshooter12 invite and I'll drop a bunch
---
Got missiles too which I don't need 
---
Lol, complaining about me responding on an open forum. Thanks for the compliment about my big brain by the way. I understand the frustration. I just disagree that it should be directed at the players instead of the designers. And again, personal attacks do little to prove your point.
---
There is no purposeful misinterpretation. Op flat out suggested allowing open pvp as his solution to this problem. That was, in fact, his only suggestion. 
---
Ok damn lol it's just a game 
---
There is no way this is true. The data is stored server side and is in a database. It’s likely true for the email support people, but not the dev team. 
---
why the hell do you have more than 1 rifle on you? and a gatling laser weights 45 pounds.
---
Yes they have improved the game a bunch already 
---
F
---
&gt; don't let them win.
---
Oh, sure, posting screenshots will definitely teach them.
---
So you want a heavily regulated market, you know even in real life it's extremely toxic. Also you are on Reddit, you can't play or check your phone throughout the  day for deals... 
---
That’s a matter of opinion
---
It’s Bethesda- naturally, they haven’t put out a clear position on the issue.
---
Given that they’re letting dupers run wild though, I have to imagine that people using game improving mods are near the bottom of their priority list. If mod users aren’t... well, that’s really not a game company whose game I would want to play. It’s definitely been frustrating that there’s no clarity though.
---
Low levels able to ruin your end game experiences is just messed up, I dont have any other words for it, I even tried talking through the mic, nothing helps
---
There weren't any other co-op console FO games that we're co-op? 🐟? Or am I wrong? Idk
---
Yea marsupial is the bomb and has been one of the last to get both time, speed demon is good too. If your at end game the food/thirst negative effect is neglible
---
You could grind out legs and learn to craft them. You could then make a mint installing them 
---
This question is off topic but what does the plus next to the board mean? That item has a resource you tagged?
---
Move on this game sounds like it is to much for you
---
You can ? Did you try ?
---
tldr I want a game that is not less fun to play if you are not scientist of its mechanics and if you are not actively countering those mechanics
---
Far as I’ve learned, you cannot set a receiver back to stock from prime :(
---
Heck if you know anyone with animal whisper have them share it and maybe you can snag a cool critter
---
Super duper is a perk card. Hence your downvotes.
---
Not related to duping but some asshole (lvl70)  just one shot killed me (lvl40) and my friend (lvl50) with a shotgun while we were at the munitions factory. Asked him why he had to be such an asshole, even when we stopped going he followed us and killed us. He said he was kinda bored of the game now. I wish he would go play something else.
---
These numbers include a  9 out of 10 adrenaline stack. (Thats the kill per 30 sec stackable dmg buff u mentioned.)
---
As far as for the furious modifier, I don't know.  I know I have heard there may be a cap on the dmg gains from furious but Ive never seen hard evidence presented.
---
No that'd be amazing... 
---
I don’t know why you’re upset that I just want to be able to play the game without disconnecting or lagging to the point of sitting there for 3 min not being able to do anything? Hahaha 
---
Who also don't have support tools to edit inventories, etc.
---
I would even drop that down to 10K excluding ammo 
---
Agreed and thats why its a suggestion. Which ever way they decide to swing it is up to them i have no faith left in people too many people bite the hands that feed them in my eyes
---
Oh wow... this is literally r/Gamingcirclejerk
---
There's one that spawns on the wes tek roof so.... It's not that rare 
---
The only right thing to do is to immediately eat the pie to gain it's power. 
---
I wonder why so many rightists are dweebs with bad taste in games. 
---
Oh fair enough Haha I didnt know I thought someone was trying to be clever :) 
---
You mean this?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/a9hhqj/bethesda_is_unbanning_modders_from_fallout_76_but/?st=JQ5VIHFE&amp;sh=d68007b4
---
Where using a Widescreen Fix resulted in a ban?
---
What I was trying to suggest above is that once the server runs out of memory it just quits. And no matter how you slice it, blame is on all sides. This is just poor coding. I'm really upset the parent company didn't have QA and consulting roles from TESO join the FO76 team. It would have been a better game at launch with their involvement. And although it's uncommon for subsidiary companies like that to be closely working together, they already mucked it up by sharing IPs across the 2. So scratch each other's backs here and make a quality product. :/
---
Ok ill send u a friend req... Doing a nuked whitespring. We gotta get you a hazmat suit if you don't have one already. Way better for rad resist than power armor.
---
Remain.
---
I'll never be hardcore enough to play the same game simultaneously on different consoles/pc's
---
People downvote for funny shit lol
---
I started a new character from scratch and knew it was weird 
---
I was able to get Ski Sword and Handmande Gun.  
---
i hate how these are level locked :( 
---
I want to collect all the plans
---
Completely agree!  I definitely hope and pray this is top on there fix-it list.
---
Unless you build on a 1x1, you probably still going to have issues, even with all the haters of the 1x1 floating camps they are still needed. I would say if you need to move often, build on a 1x1, if you want to move to another permanent home, you need to rebuild, just how it is. I figure if I need to move and built on the ground then I would rebuild, currently I have 2 floating camps ..
---
Okay, we will go level him up more and see what we can do. Thank you!
---
Overemphasizing, Sounds like you are getting too worked up by this game. You should stop playing.
---
I'm on Xbox, don't remember their gamer tag. What's your tag, I'll add you and call when I need back up!
---
I'm on Playstation and it's kicking about every ten minutes. 
---
That's what I was saying, since for some reasons I can comment on the asshole like remark about being allergic to letters I'll say it here. This is not a friend fucking three states over this is reddit. You will get alot more peoples attention if you put a tldr. Most people are going to just stop fucking reading halfway with your rambling about power leveling and being alpha. Please tell me this is not all you do with your time and if it is are you at least getting paid. (not sarcasm.) 
---
I don't disagree. But you suggested taking it out on them as the solution. It's not their fault. There should be a better way. Killing them when they show up to fight would ruin their beginning game experiences which would mean they don't stick around. This would kill the game for all of us.
---
That is pretty awesome man!   Congrats stickin with it and hammering through.  Helluva memory to create in the Wasteland together!
---
They won't balance PvP. Simple.
---
Lol alright mom I’ll take a break
---
If YOU could read, the only thing I called motherfucker was your post.
---
You'd think someone so long-winded would be able to comprehend the written word. 
---
Watoga Train Station or Super Market Vendor has them. I saw many at the train station. 
---
You also might want list your platform.
---
The plain combat armor plans have the names "Light combat armor arms/legs/torso".  If you learnt anything else then you can't craft combat armor.
---
I remember CiV IV coming out as a total shit game, 3 months later a little patience some DLCs and it was perfect.
---
This is the new norm, if you love a franchise I don't mind DEVs releasing a product to be further refined just so I can get it in my hands.  It's not like they're pumping and dumping, I am playing FO76 and having a damn good time.
---
Do miss NPCs though...
---
Oh, i see. I didn't reach that part yet. I just heard about people nuking stuff to get some PA mods :p  
---
But now that you've said it i do remember that since the beggining the overseer talks about the possibility of using the nukes as an last resort to stop that plague from leaving West Virginia
---
&gt;I don't rush into things,
---
This is why I don't load multiplayer in Borderlands 2. Not all of the characters are mobbers. Two are more powerful staying back, one does massive damage while she hides, because her bullets rochet towards targets. But no, they all rush in and all die at once, and get mad at me because I don't rush in to revive them, which isn't possible for all three. 
---
Thanks, I'm a poor fellow
---
Level from from vendor is 15-20. From Prison any level will get it.
---
All TSE’s should be wiped.  All accounts with a pair of identical unique weapons should be wiped. Anyone with more than 10 identical uniques or exceeding some threshold of rare materials like serums flux, prime ammo... should have their account wiped and get a 30 day ban, and a warning that any further exploiting will be a permanent ban. 
---
Looks good with an electric chair behind it
---
Yeah. Sorry about the quality. This version is a hasty phone pic. I had to get this here asap. The world needs to see these guys.
---
Amazing that a game this incredibly unstable and buggy still has defenders...
---
Dude if my girlfriend played a game as serious as fallout I wouldn't mock her at all... Lol 
---
Last I checked the wood was used in the dupe.
---
If you still need your mom to point out when you have a problem... Well let's say you have more problems than a game...
---
Dumpster Baby Drop Off....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!!!
---
Lmfao those names...are these 2012 cod kids?
---
Hahahahaha
---
I see that, when forced to make an actual civilised sentence, you are capable of finishing the given task.  
---
If you think that your post cannot be interpreted as a direct insult then, sorry to say, but your opinion on anything is irrelevant because its simply disconnected from anything.
---
Sounds like a connection problem...
---
Are you gonna fuck their shit up?
---
Yeah you can but it will depend how you build it, don't go over crazy, test it first. If you just looking for a building should be no issue, same as camps. If you build around the workshop, you may have trouble replacing it, you going to have to test designs.
---
There was a fantasitc post from a guy who gave war type game to his grandfather to play and his grandfather stealthed nearly the entire game, only killing when the storyline forced it. 
---
Maybe a notification when someone has 10k+ of anything. Then have someone spend 5 minutes looking at their character or 20k+ of anything temp ban their account for 8 hours.
---
They had it in the Atom store today. Its a 1 day only sale so if you want it you'd better grab it. No telling how long before it returns.
---
You don't have the right perks then. It should weight under 10 iirc. I know miniguns weight 2 pounds. 
---
As for why do I have multiple rifles; why wouldn't I? Different rifles for different needs. A 308 / Gauss / Lever for sniping, a Handmade for mid to long range and sustained dps, and a shotgun for close to mid range / crippling. Rank 3 enforcer is stupid. It's great. 
---
Plus one or two melee weapons. 
---
This
---
for some sort of bringing an inch of realism to role play.  1k lbs would pretty much crush most people.  That is more than half the weight of a 1990s Honda Civic.
---
Some quest items. Mount Blair specificly
---
You can't get them from forbidden knowlege. Trust me.. I've handed in at least 1000 tech data by this point. Not sure if you're looking at old files, or what.
---
I've soeone has more more than initiate, or (especially) they have all of them, they are cheating.
---
I'm not saying the paints don't exist in the game files.. I'm saying that you can't get them from questing currently.
---
I’m running an Ethernet cord straight to router and I get 100mbs. I thought the same thing at first
---
I feel like there is one, I had a furious Gatlin and it worked well for two shotting charred ghouls but if I say used it on an assultron dominator the first three hits would steadily increase but shortly after that they would do similar damage on each shot. I was a bit disappointed. 
---
Yeah what an asshole, I hope you blocked and reported him.
---
Repairing guns removes them from the repair gun list but not your inventory. This happens every time I repair mine
---
Indeed. It is somewhat a challenge of how to let the players actually make a difference on a server but still some gameplay sessions may be short, others long. You may be disconnected for some reason, other people might do stuff themselves that change stuff on the "world" you are. Very hard stuff to pull out from a dev point of view but it could definitely add massively to the game if well done.   
---
Personally i never could imagine how that could be implemented in a good way. I'm very curious about the ideas people have (and there are a lot of good ideas scattered around this subreddit)
---
So if you go to the Charleston train station and cross that bridge you will find a Grafton Monster that usually spawns there. Kill, loot but be sure to go back over the bridge. One reason is it assures you will spawn there on the next server. The other is, assuming no one has built a base there, it will trigger a random encounter. This can be anything from dogs to the elusive roaming vendor bot. Then server hop.
---
If you've done the mayor for a day quest just grab your All rise and kill bots in watoga they won't fight back. Otherwise go play around in a silo. Tend to drop a pile of those after every nuke launch. The game keeps spawning robots until you get to the point of putting your card in for the actual launch makes for a great steel,  lead, fusion cell farm just not much xp.
---
I don't understand how, what with all the game has to offer; you choose to play this way. 
---
To be so methodical and loot focused seems alien to me, I'm sure it strips some of the fun. At least some of the charm. 
---
So you ever actually play? Because this sounds like turning it into work, haha. 
---
:)
---
I locked up my camp... Idk why but someone came in level 79 and killed me while I was talking my dog out...sooooo locked lol... Even though he is prob level 3 anyway 😪
---
Did everyone clap? 
---
You will have better luck getting the plans by doing the event patrol duty if you can actually get it to start. 
---
Bethesda should add some grime and skid marks for the lulz xD
---
Monorail Elevator: Go up and there are about ten bags give or take lying around.
---
Abandoned Bog Town: In a construction building there are also at least ten bags on the floor.
---
How can you hate on that!?! It's great!
---
I think your a shill payed by Bethesda 
---

There you go.
---
I wanted to try to get GUN-FU running at a max stack too, but i've dropped it since vats doesn't work well with a 2 shot weapon.
---
That shit isn’t even funny. I wouldn’t normally go out of my way to grief but this shit and people who build on whitespings golf course with there turrets boils my blood. I spent an hour last time coaxing a level 68 deathclaw matriarch to someone’s house before and I would certainly do it again. 
---
From one girl to another, 45% off gamers are female. Adding that you're a girl really doesn't change the story.
---
Seems to be more and more frequent as of late. 
---
F yeah!!!! Great story.
---
Thanks for the answer! That helps,  gives me some hope! And if you don't mind me asking another question,  do know if it's available at the Grafton station?  Or anywhere to get a plan for it?
---
I know its not the right way, but what else can we do??
---
Dude quit spamming the comment section with your post
---
Im just happy i got lucky from a machine
---
About character customization. Here's my 2nd character.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/PMI8uOd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PMI8uOd.jpg)
---
I also need these! I feel alot is lacking from C.A.M.P workshop mode, and would love to see it improved. Especially adding Logic Gates 
---
World containers should be capped to the same amount as our characters or stash - doesn't make sense to carry infinite weight in any container.
---
(Although we can dupe via dropping a bag on the ground, perhaps the bag we drop also be capped to the player's capacity, stash capacity, etc?)
---
Many of the items being duped have issues being stacked or become unstacked during the process. Many people create a all-knowing mule that has 1 of every item in the game (that's the goal at least) and when they log in they simply drop everything. It's going to be a hard thing to fix because these mules no longer need to craft anything at all. If they don't fix the underlying issue of whatever server code crashes because of the 274 stack of boards - well, there's no way to stop duplication. 
---
But you can make it a pain in the dick by capping the containers. I think that should be another hotfix / patch the team makes for sure!
---
Yeah, this is happening a lot at Whitespring during Bloated Horde massacres. 
---
Conan Exiles and SCUM are also just as shameless!
---
yes, it's for a BoS quest where you hand them in for a random reward.
---
I dunno, even the flamers on youtube will mention that the game is more tolerable if you play it with friends.  However, a lot of players don't have a circle of friends to play with, and as a solo game, the fun is far more lacking.
---
It's shitty they said you're shit at gaming. I will say that I've watched friends play video games, and there's a line in the sand I draw. My best friend is a very good gamer, however he is incredibly meticulous about every video game he plays. He explores every nook and cranny of a building. He wants to find everything. And that is so incredibly boring to watch. He can whip my ass at a lot of games, but god damn is he boring as hell to watch when he's in RPG mode. 
---
Depends on what you offer? 
---
Luck holds no effect on legendary loot drops, it simply effects random stuff like cap drops and ammo outside of the perks that it allows. (if even that) luck simply raised all non special stats by one in previous games so at 15 you would have 15 extra damage 15 extra hp 15 extra res of all kind etc. Nothing more. At least nothing that can be backed up by facts. 
---
What are you doing?
---
wtf, I woulda been hyped in my GF liked Fallout lol, the most intense game my girl would play was GH.
---
More bans would mean more copies of the game purchased
---
Yes randomly placing resource collectors and turrets won't work I assume... Burying the workshop beneath walls and such likewise
---
**The shop is closed for the night. We will be open all day Sunday. Thanks for stopping by**
---
Agreed. I played ark for its first 2 - 3 years. Fallout is nothing when it comes to bugs
---
I have no clue how smart you are, but reading this you just sound like a fool trying his hardest to sound smart. 
---
This could also explain why certain power armor parts and plans are so exceedingly rare. And also why I haven't seen any new weapon plans in 1 month. 
---
That is sad to hear! I was hoping that a furious ripper could do serious work.
---
I don't use weight reduction perks. it's a waste.
---
If you go under your stored items, you can scrap it. It will return all the placed items to your stored inventory. I've had to do it for the first couple of my camps till I started doing smaller form factors.
---
They craft many things in a short amount of time to lag the server and trigger.  Boards are the easiest to make needing only 3 wood and 1 leather each. The earliest tutorials for the dupe glitch said 300 boards is the best way to trigger it. 
---
They have gone from my inventory also, my Radial Wheel now has two empty slots 1 &amp; 2 that used to be my two level 50 Combat Shotguns.
---
This happened while repairing from the Modify/Repair menu. Very odd. I didn't Drop or Scrap them I know the confirm dialogue. Must be a bug. I'm verifying the client again.
---
Wow I’m dumb
---
Tks for the help every one!!
---
Actually you can. Use the stilt foundation pieces. As long as they can reach the bottom without being completely submerged you are good. If you want to go deeper you need to play with stairs and second story floors.
---
So, how do I get rid of the old one? It's taking up like 98% of my budget and maybe I looked past it but I don't see how to get rid of it.
---
And probably some real creepy messages too.
---
Mules have been a common thing historically in all online games with limited storage. They don't and will never violate any rules and there is no way a company would make a rule against them.
---
^ Pretty sure I’ve seen people selling the painted stuff/cosmetic skins. 
---
I’m going to rank Class Freak up to 3 before I roll the dice anymore and end up getting any crappy mutations that I need to Radaway and end up losing a good one.
---
Question on Carnivore/Herbivore. I currently have Carnivore and from what I read that means I can’t satisfy hunger with veggies. But correct me if I’m wrong aren’t veggies mostly in drinks for recipes?  Aren’t the only “foods” with veggies the soups?  So does this mutation have any affect on my drinks and thirst?  Or am I totally getting it wrong?
---
Hell, I'll say it -- well done!  I didn't solo one until well into my 50s, and I still prefer to duck out if I'm at Whitespring and make the bots tease it until it gets right angry and I toss bits of trash at it to give it low self-esteem.
---
Hey man I’m just out here tryna play games, I think it’s fun
---
Discord channels for sure. I don't know why there's nothing in the game's UI and UX to help people group together / play towards the same goal. 
---
What the hell are you even trying to say with this comment? You've made so many grammatical errors over there acting high and mighty its not even funny. It's a comment. Not a post. You have a big ego and you have no grasp on the real world or how things work. 
---
8 is great for running gunsmith and power patcher for the longer lasting gun and PA durability. Covers all of my crafting needs as long as I juggle my perk cards between work benches. You shouldn't have any problems.
---
That's really childish, though, no matter what their age.  
---
It's great for everyone. Waste less healing by over healing, cap value goes up by 60%, healing value goes up by 100%. Dilute your stimpaks if you have chemist and purified water.
---
Probably potential digging sites. Obviously if they have the giant machine set up, they found a potential place there. As for the other one, idk...maybe it's to show that they should have dug there and not where the abandoned mineshaft is?
---
I never had much problems with granades, stimpacks or combat in general. Sometims when enemies are too close my VATS shots never hit but beside that combat was normal for me. What actually do happens is that sometimes i change weapons and the game takes like 10 seconds to do the change. But gladly it's not usual.  
---
What level your main char? Life was indeed somewhat hard for me in combat until i found decent equipment, got some combat perks (at first i was just getting non-combat perks). I usually travel light but when i see a difficult battle coming on i rapidly deploy my PA and get some heavy guns i save for those moments. The hability to craft ammo for me allows me to always have some minigun ammo for dire situations but i have to keep an eye on lead and steel (and remember to equip the ammosmith perk!)  
---
Once somebody sold a Zealot's .50 Cal Machinegun to a vendor. Best purchase ever since the dmg bonus counts towards scorched beasts.
---
I'm guessing the radroach and boards are the tools used to dupe the items, not the items being duped
---
You can also go to the mine that has radioactive barrels and the decontamination shower, do the same thing. Great tip about removing adding because and repeating, didn't think of that one.
---
Been encumbered since day 1 of beta.  Currently at 1800-something.  Stealth and Gatling build.  
---
Yes, I am a complete coward.
---
Godboss should change his name to "nolife."
---
I have the opposite problem. Every time there's a queen fight, the damned thing dies so quickly that it's no fun at all. I only use trash guns personally for a bit of challenge, but apparently everyone else has a TSE now.
---
Right now you can only get it by being shady or have someone shady give you the mask. It is not currently*legitimately* obtainable in the game right now.
---
Platform??
---
Are those free range,  grass fed, certified organic Mirelurks? Because I refuse to feed my feral ghoul children anything that's not completely organic. And are they gluten free because little Billy the youngest of my Ghoul children will break out in a rash if he has gluten.
---
There's more to the game than being meta and if you were the most meta you wouldn't be making hundreds of helmets and getting no loot drops. You are running in circles because you had just said in the post before you deleted it that you "haven't had a single decent loot drop yet." I really hope you do something other than play this game because you just seem like a NEET at this point and reee at anyone who disagrees. 
---
Anyone using [FO76Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/30) can verify the above information is correct. BoS T-60 paints (and certain BoS outfits) are rare drops from Forbidden Knowledge (and no other repeatable BoS quest, as far as I could see).
---
I was gonna say, the XP glitch shouldn't be a character building exercise.
---
Doesn’t say what platform nice 
---
Ohh te, I forgot Ps4
---
Thank you to the molotov users. Fire beats trying to chase the flying corpses after a frag or similar.
---
Add me on Ps4
---
K? 
---
BoS vendor in Watoga.
---
I'm more inclined to want to friend these guys
---
This shit is hilarious
---
I have an explosive Gatling now. So next time I see one of these imma level it. I’m not one for telling people how to play a game, but if you ENJOY playing that way, there’s something wrong with you 
---
I have often wanted to nuke workshops that were taken from me. For no reason. 
---
Level 401? It’s the result of farming for legendaries and other goods the legit way instead of “duping” everything 
---
It’s possible you were in the recycle window. You wouldn’t be the first person to scrap items on accident being in the wrong menu 
---
Send you a message on PSN and added you
---
I could be wrong, I usually test stuff like this out and when I get back on later I'll let you know for sure, most of the stuff I tried it on either died too fast or had so much health it was hardly noticible. I had a furious Mr handy blade but recently sold it. I'll save the post and upload some stuff from imgur later for it. 
---
You still have to place them.  
---
Bathroom mirrors are searchable.didnt realize that for hours so are red doctor's bags

My only problem with the perk is sometimes I get the success icon way after I've left the room.

Love getting to OP8 in Borderlands 2/TPS, then reloading normal mode, equipping a homing spike shield, and explore every nook and cranny, also finding ways off-map, with grenade jumps.  [Here's one of my favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lazG-V19o4k). 
---
well why the fuck did you blur their user ID then? get them out of here. let them be known.
---
In the room for uranium fever at blackwater mine. Top of the monorail elevator at the end of the stranded train car. It's bags that look like fertilizer. A friend needed some and I brought back 75 concrete JUST from the monorail elevator.
---
Had a 300-something whacking me with a protest sign in my camp tonight. That was....odd.
---
I don't even know what this means aren't there plans for skins in the game?
---
Got top marks in typing class too.
---
I figured as much as soon as I saw him. Can't imagine how many hours he's clocked
---
Oh thats his actual username. OK, I just thought you were calling him a godboss because of his high level.
---
But that could be legit, just farm Whitesprings relentlessly. 
---
Nope. Apparently it's content coming soon. :/
---
bug reports to those who could actually fix the issues.
---
There's no way this is legit, right?
---
I think the power armor mods and plans are intentionally rare. You still see them all at high levels, just not very frequently.
---
Light combat armor plans seemed level-locked though. I saw them regularly on my lvl 15 alt at Watoga Station, but never on my main. 
---
I believe it indicated the item is 'better' than your currently equipped. It's not always (read: rarely ever) correct as it ignores legendary effects along with other factors. 
---
:( interesting though
---
It happened to me with my legendary.
---
Here's the thing... if that was allowed, who's to stop me from photoshopping your name on some incriminating screenshots and posting them to get you banned? Or anyone else? See the problem? 
---
Yeah radium has been my only option for quite a while. 
---
If you’re on Xbox message me I have lots of each and can sell for caps cheaper than you’d buy from vendors.

The widescreen guy turned out to be a troll

Hail Monthman, keeper of years.

Add me cooljuanito99 
---
She takes further reduced damage the more people there are. So in a way, she has more effective hp
---
what the fuckity fuck
---
But... but they have improved. The experience for new players now is vastly better than what it was for a lot of us. The stuck in power armor bug was fixed thank fuck. Numerous other fixes have been implemented. 
---
Yeah this is great. Two thumbs up!
---
7600 worth maybe?
---
You don't know what you've got*
---
What if someone just happened to find this stuff in a crate?
---
clown
---
I have it, what can you offer me?
---
Be happy.. If the dude is that much if a cunt over video games.. It will get worse later. Okay the game how you want.. These dickboys that expect everyone to minmax and raid and shit are annoying in games. They ruin gaming.
---
I’d rather see perk cards apply to your stash. Want to store 35 heavy guns? Put on bear arms. Better yet, give us mods for our personal stash that reduce the weight of different types of items, maybe 2-3 slots on your stash box. They can be semi permanent like power armor mods wrapped right into the transfer screen with a key to equip a mod, and are destroyed when unequipped.
---
Or, you could 1) Use no more than 2 Heavy Weapons, a Ballistic and an Energy one(or juts one that has explosive rounds, preferably with Furious or Anti-Armor).  2) Actually use the perk that reduces their weight by 90% and carry them on you instead of leaving them in your stash to never use.  3) Farm for 3 Star armor that has the 20% less Weapon weight(this applies to the people complaining about Rifle weight too).
---
I thought it was her damage taken that was scaled, not HP
---
That's what I thought but as he was running around a few other players saw and joined me as we watched him jetpack around lol. Whether his level was obtained ethically or not I do not know
---
Simple, add a check that notes if your weight is over something ridiculous (like 2000) and delete items if it is over that amount. Make it work for stash too, probably a larger amount.
---
If it’s any consolation, pretty much all of the resources you spend when you first start building on a workshop aren’t yours. Workshops come with their own resource pool. Resources in green are from that pool, white ones are yours. 
---
Ok i havent seen these stats anywhere is there somewhere this is verified not saying i dont believe but alot gets said and lost along the way
---
Na, he used the exp glitch
---
perks don't effect stash size.
---
Watoga High School for at least 70 plastic.
---
Why redact his name?  Shame this jerk.  He totally deserves it.
---
You can press R to store everything in the blueprint
---
Her DR goes up.
---
I had that when I was not playing that long yet, now I have bad luck all the time lol. 
---
Have the caps. Just sent you a message on PS4 Network and tried to add you
---
It's reddit, did you really expect a higher level of intelligence? LoL
---
Why they haven't included stack limits and a hard weight limit is beyond me. 
---
Depends on playstyle I find, some people will carry more than one weapon depending on the situation. And with heavy weapons those perks make all the difference if you don't have the calibrated shocks for power armour/going without PA. And the rifles can be over 20 pounds each, they don't have a weight reduction perk and they weight insane amounts for the higher tier rifles. The point he's getting at is that as a heavy weapons player, your heavy weapons benefit from the weight reduction perk massively and a min-maxed build will normally have the perk, where as rifles don't even have the perk as an option.
---
Honestly you should have uncensored their name and blast them. 
---
Except for their 20 alts with the same junk?
---
Can confirm. It’s a gamble.
---
Looks like that is in white spring too. Would have to rebuild after a nuke but would be fun to watch them annihilate bloating glowing mobs!
---
Platform?
---
Damn I wonder if he’s got any special points or something from playing that long ....😕
---
I find it interesting that a few days / weeks ago on Twitter they shared some odd details about "how many robots were killed". Some statistic that revealed they do have a system in place measuring some things.
---
With a legitimate metrics and reporting system, they could easily find accounts of dupers and begin taking actions against their account. I'd recommend a policy of simply warning of the behavior and temporary bans that grow longer for each violation.
---
Better yet - with this system in place you can have an anti-cheat platform that allows you to find exploiters when there are a set of known behaviors, and be proactive against exploits that you aren't aware of quite yet. It's a simple system that has flags, scoring, automated and human interactions. 
---
And they could start right now for free by simply using the xAPI framework and code that's available to anyone and everyone - it's open source. We are developing something like this to offer game developers but it wasn't really thought of as anti-cheat but more as "data driven decisions at critical stages of design, development, and QA".
---
I launched a nuke and got blue-screened just a couple mins into the nuke zone so it’s not all about leaving unlooted bodies around.
---
Some plans I see at high level like bracers and motion assist servos, but I that is literally all I have seen. 
---
I have been server hopping 2-3 hours a day, at watoga for 14 days straight without seeing any other plan. So it's easy to get the impression something is wrong/bugged. 
---
they clearly have that ability in the literal sense, what they mean is that doing a database query comparing every single item in every single user's inventory is not a thing they can realistically do. There is like 1.4 million users, and each one probably has 100 things in their inventory. Checking them all on a live server is a big chunky query to try to stick into a live game. 
---
Oh yes. I played Ark on PC when it was in Beta than early release on PS4. Damn that game had so many bugs and the building (without S+ mod) was the most frustrating thing ever. 
---
The bugs in Both Ark and PUBG make FO76 look like a well polished machine 😜
---
You wanna grow gourds, just go to Raleigh Clay's bunker and pick a gourd from his grow room.
---
Also they desperately need tools to run scripts against players logs and players meta data (such as inventory). 
---
Im not sure if you get the bonus thirst recovery ie boiled water is 15 and tea is 18 so you might only get 15? Idk though, I have herbivore and eat a lot of corn soup and dog food and much on wild berries when I find them.
---
That's what I was sure it looks like, until I looked at statistical analysis done by people who were much more serious about this stuff than I am.
---
I'd assume Bethesda can look at your actual items and actually check if you are duping
---
How much damage did it do? I’ve wanted to hit someone with a protest sign 
---
Fuken typo demon
---
That was me ;P
---
I was repairing the guns from the Modify/Repair section of weapons workbench, I hit T then Space as usual and they vanished. But thanks for the suggestion but I've been repairing now for weeks, shotguns need a lot of repair.
---
They've gone nothing to do but play the game and hope for plans or random spawn. I'll go melee for now. But I'm loosing faith in the stability of this game's inner workings. 
---
Bethesda will not replace lost items, it's on their website. Eve Online customer service used to check and if it was a bug they just placed them back in your inventory.
---
I was all about this post until I read this. I'll just smack an arrow and move on now. (Guess which arrow)
---
Damn dio abusing his stand powers for loot again.
---
Are you guys still doing this or is it over?
---
The Grafton vendors do have BoS &amp; deep pocketed combat armor mod plans, but I'm not sure about the light combat armor plans. Watoga Station vendor has them, but I think they're level gated. You might still be ok at level 35.
---
Note that you only need the one plan, preferably arms. You can spam minimum-level arms to unlock all the scrappable mods.
---
In a sense that i dont trust other players not to find ways to ruin it then yes a heavily regulated market in my opinion is a good thing but i agree with you and the other people messaging me about having an open market cause it does let the economy flourish while leaving people feeling like they got a deal or got what they think worth value is. As for the fallout shopping channel i am running around the map in the little time i do have got no time to window shop. 
---
Heading to bed gotta work in the morning feel free to leave a rebuttal i will reply tomorrow morning
---
Or Godboss could be a disabled vet that sits at home making 40k retirement and really loves gaming...
---
Mocking women playing games is a great way to guarantee more access to the PC/console. How do I know? It's exactly the same stunt my friends and I were guilty of as teenagers. We thought were we funny and clever, but we were just stupid dickheads. Funny how growing up changes your perspective.
---
Fast forward a few decades and my lady is the hardcore gamer in the house. Similar style of play to yours - slow and steady. She still gets shit from lads: one 18yo boasting that he finished Skyrim in under 10 hours when she was still working through side quests after a couple of hundred hours. "Congratulations" she told the smirking little turd, "You've managed to beat a women in her 40s. You must be so proud."
---
Good on you for actually _playing_. Even if someone is "rubbish" what does it matter? The whole point is to have fun. Rushing through quests seems like a surefire way to minimise the value you get out of a game. 
---
Didn't say they did. What I'm saying is, it's not unfair to you that they don't. Rifle users don't have *any* perks; while *your* weapons weight 2 pounds, mine weight 20 in *and* out of stash. 
---
Besides, you shouldn't be keeping weapons in your stash anyway, at least not enough to use up a large chunk. 
---
It'll pop up when you are doing the Boss quests. 
---
Server hopping solo nuke runs, farming and farming Nd farming. I got at least 56 levels from doing nuke runs with some friends and just killing stuff.
---
Mine was caused by loading my first load of the day into a nuke zone. I play unyielding spec so I panicked to get into power armor as I out it down and climbed into it I died.  I realized after the game thought I was in power armor despite showing my unyielding gear.  I found this out cause when I finally alt f4d and came back I was in power armor .  The glitch fixes when you leave server it seems but I lost all the junk I was collecting from last time I played.  Not a big loss but just frustrated with all the little things I keep trying to overlook. 
---
That sucks, my shotguns weren't special, I'll have to replace but I'm now going to build up a backup collection to replace losses through the game software as an insurance.
---
Found one on a rooftop once that had a teddy bear face down with stitches on his ass and another one right behind with a scalpel and magnifying glass. So long ago I can't remember where. 
---
Misinformed about what? What does the Blizzard group have to do with anything? Clockworks and the League of Legends A&amp;M group AND pages are still active - I’m a part of them.
---
I owned two before, I can comfirm that it is garbage and I wasn't even sure if furious was taking effect or not
---
This game has duping glitch that existed 20 years ago. Holy fuck how low can this game go, Failure of the Century!!!!
---
Those are things I dont actively play.
---
Which one. 
---
I had a guy rock into my camp and start yelling about how I was a duper in voice because i had a locked door around a golf bag. I just want to move shit to my alt in peace, no duper lives on the golf course at whitesprings :D
---
Nice. Im either in T60, or a porcelain cannon. I like to use my legendary berserker knuckles (+40%swing  +something else), with only the best encalve under armor and 1 weightless marine leg.
---
I'm 307.  No xp glitch.  Just was efficient with my in game time unitl around 250 where I slowed down and stopped grinding.  I'd probably be in my 400s now as well if I didn't start being more casual.
---
Just because someone's a high level doesn't mean they used the glitch
---
There's several bags in harpers ferry jus north of Wallace around the chem bench and raider body
---
This is the game. You found a creative way to fight back. Without a Big bad npc there leaves a void.
---
True they have fixed something’s but other things just keep coming and it’s making me think this game won’t ever be where is should be
---
People deciding prices on things isn't bad if duping us fixed etc. It's not exploiting anything by overcharging it's just stupid and would likely resultin low sales. If the economy and spawns are fixed it will become easier to guess an items value and you can just choose not to buy there
---
Iff the economy is fixed I honestly see weapon values going up, but at the same time if your items are also more valuable you have more to trade with. In just a few trades I felt I was swimming in caps. Maybe a reasonable limit would be good because then you know if youve got 5k then you know you can get anything they're selling. Forcing prices would just stop people from selling if they thitheir items are worth more 
---
He still had to place them down, which is the dick move. When I move my camp I get like 100 Tato plants added into my inventory but I know better than to place them all. 
---
I dont get how people can enjoy a game with cheats, what is the point of playing at all then. Jut play something else, if you can not handle the way it is meant to be played.
---
Now that is magical.
---
I feel like fallout 5 has to have these guys as a real thing instead of a bug. They would fit perfectly in the fallout world as a real monster. 
---
indeed fusion cores are still easy to get even with the nerf to fusion generators and they don't weigh much (0.1? i think) with max batteries included.
---
Right on my man! You provided me with good information. Thanks for replying to my questions fast. Appreciate it. 
---
That's about 87% of a whole year.
---
Solo player here, still enjoy it.
---
It's only a dick move if you believe players should just accept the fact that this game is a buggy mess and work around it. I think we should be holding Bethesda accountable.
---
The game looks absolutely trash, even Ultra setting on PC, worst shadow pop-in, shittiest texture, the only good is the volumetric lighting, other than that the game loooks fucking terrible, probably the worst in recent years, stop fucking lying to yourself.
---
That's insane..... Why charge so damn much then 
---
I would never tell someone they’re shit at something, least of all my girlfriend. Some guys are dorks. Rock on gf!
---
There are plenty (albeit still in the minority overall) of games in which RMT is a thing, allowed by some studios and not allowed by most. Anything from single items to entire accounts with thousands of items. This has been a thing since UO, the first graphical MMORPG. Items can be a few dollars, all the way up to to the extreme of hundreds of thousands. 
---
Look bro, and/or... ma'am? Thing is, Bethesda don't want to ban the dupers.
---
If I only I could upvote more than once. 
---
How could it be accurate? There's no way to do a side by side comparison on the same ghoul, loot drop is random, I have 9 luck and I've had 5 different explosive weapons drop. By the math these people did I shouldny even have that. Can you give me a link for proof since you are Mr meta? 
---
LOL. I was bemused and amused!
---
*looks calmly to the right side of the trade menu* GOOD FUCKING JESUS
---
You should consider gaming on your first dates so you can get through this process faster.
---
No, I logged in and tried it again this morning. It multiplied all of my barriers, turrets, and crops
---
&gt;it's not the inventory or anything that causes the server lag W
---
I wouldn't go that far. Opening up an inventory of thousands and thousands of objects causes lag. Just looking at a dupers inventory can lag the game. It's fucked both ways.
---
The perks you have that affect the weight of items only effects the items in your inventory, not the items in your stash. 
---
I almost spill my milk out when I see him wrote the game looks fantastic lmao!!!!!
---
Yes. In this thread I am asking if there is one in 76. Thanks for your valuable contribution.
---
He just was not a fan of SYNTHesized drugs.
---
I was hitting him in pacifist mode so nothing. 
---
I like the idea, but i've only played "with someone" a couple of times and it's been mostly me following them on their quests to area's I haven't been yet.
---
There have been several times I wish I had someone helping me out (still haven't taken on a scorched beast because I'm a lone) but for the most part i've been okay wandering alone at my own pace to explore, loot and listen to holotapes. 
---
I just made it to White Springs the other day (lvl 42) and fuckin' a the random 80-90 lvl deathclaws and stuff have be fucking me up. 
---
&gt;Also you edited your post, removing the line about banning everyone with over 100,000 of any item, from this post, by removing it, it shows the core foundation of the witchhunt (*ban everyone with more than I feel is reasonable*) is flawed.
---
It's not my post, stupid. Follow along.
---
Try one of the trading subreddits 
---
yes, the method literally duplicates what you put in so your 5 nuka colas become 10, 20, 40, 80 as you say. It's efficient with things that stack like mats and weapons but not so good for armour.
---
Okay I’ll add 
---
Wat
---
I'm like level 100 and I spend so much time just hanging out at camp, workshop, wandering around. I could easily be that level if I was focused on leveling.
---
Ha, absolutely!
---
Is this still true with the weapon artisan damage buff though?
---
Go back to T_D plz.
---
Didn’t get anything, PSN: dlimbillion 
---
I havent had any issues
---
Great source of income.
---
Do you consider mods cheating? 
---
Thought I was going crazy or just plain not good at finding them... Thanks for the validation!
---
This just happened to me, I lost my two main shotguns my newish level 50s, really annoying. There is nothng we can do as Bethesda do not have any system in place to check and replace items.
---
Really gut punching when you get your setup just so and end up being penalised through a client glitch. I was repairing my shotguns, hit T then Space and each time the gun disappeared from the repair list my inventory, leaving empty spaces on the Radial Wheel. Just gone, end of story.
---
Yeah - except if you play more than 45 minutes at a time in a single day then you spend more time deleting and throwing your resources away completely. So there's that....
---
Good on you for ditching those guys. They are shit at relationships.
---
Anyway, you're playing the game just fine. As long as you love it then it's time well spent. What other point to games is there? 
---
This is what happens when you don't update your engine for many years. 
---
Just their subtle way of pointing out why they didn't make fallout mutliplayer before now.
---
Had another clear out today. Walked from ski resort to Morgantown, overencumbered as hell to get to the level seven I had targeted. About half an hour later I have arrived and look around for him...
---
Found him inside the airport by Maria Chavez, low on health and all that getting ghouled in the face. 
---
I take out the last one attacking him and waved hello.
---
I then invited to trade and he didn't accept, probably sketched out a bit. I give it the heart emoji and then tried again. Didn't accept. Last chance time. I just dropped weapons, armour, aid, plans, rarer junk. The lot. All in a risky paper bag. All the level 10-15 stuff I had. Missile launcher, shotguns, rifles, a black powder pistol and some ammo for all. Then I frantically jumped around pointing my gun at the bag. He crept up and I saw the bag disappear after like 2 solid minutes. Then I see the heart above his head and it was cool. I do this every time I can because I practice Three Dog-ism, haha.
---
Then I got killed by a wendingo whilst taking a photo, doh!
---
Enjoy your subreddit ban and potential sitewide ban for witchunting.
---
Its like these posts keep coming up and the subsequent user is banned.
---
No one cares that these people just might be at their camp together, doing fuck all. They just see names and go on tirades.
---
Idk ifi had the xp perk equipped I'd be at least.... 15 percent farther along and I'm close to 200.  Plus leader bobbleheads maybe helped. 
---
They said they reduced xp gains but I've gotten like 680 xp from glowing ghouls. Maybe the xp is just scaling tho 
---
In my original post I have described methods on how to circumvent the vendor cap limit (moving it to 14000 caps daily), and how to farm legendary items in abundance that the servers are barely able to handle, no duping.  
---
I might be a fool, but what was foolish on my part is that I wished to share my observations and the strategic information that I had access to. Judging by the response I received, as long as you don't keep it two short sentences, you will be called names just for the amounts of letters that you have used, irrespective of the value of what those letters were combined into.  
---
What I will continue to do is to use this knowledge. What I will cease to do is to attempt to share it.
---
I want giant rad buffalos and tad tornados in Kansas 
---
The boards is what allows them to disconnect.
---
Bobbleheads and magazines stack time I believe? So if you pop a bunch you have a longer lasting buff.
---
LOL. Game company releases buggiest game in their history, using dated and inferior game engine which is barely suited to single player games. For multiplayer. End result is buggy, downright broken, and not at all suitable for multi player games. Players exploit broken dated engine, even in beta. Company cannot fix. 
---
We all buy the game and complain anyway. Someone at Bethseda is laughing their ass off. Based on the number of blue screen crashes on PS4 alone this should be a refund for all users. Never ever seen a game so broken on any platform.
---
Yea all I see now are Radium Rifles. lvl100. Missed out on Flamer. hoping to see it drop somewhere.
---
Ah, so it probably wasn't me and I just got a crap drop. Thanks for explaining.
---
There are many exp boosters you can use while grinding and/or farming legendaries. The different cranberry foods stack and give exp buffs, canned meat stew, being well rested, and I think there are a few other things you can use. 
---
We're launching the nuke as i type this 
---
Sent you a friend request
---
Ah okay..I’ll have to run up to one of my friends when I play and just randomly whack him.
---
That guy that lied? Wow, thanks for weakening your point.
---
Or fix the duping bug and stop being stupid - because anyone can pick up 1,000s of lbs of shit on a mule. Duping is the issue that needs a solution. Let the big boys handle this one - you just find a stable server to go play on.
---
**ImMoistForYou**
---
WHAT YOU SAY?!
---
Ok hope I can log in in time
---
They should be offloading the data to a warehouse.  It would be easy then and wouldn’t impact the live DB performance. 1.4 million rows is nothing on a database depending on indexes and how they store item data. 
---
what has this to do with mods, the other trader has over 1000 of bobble heads!
---
Damnit you guys are going to make me cry. 
---
Level 101, still haven’t fought scorch queen.
---
Take out scorch beasts in 3-5 shots
---
So stack Lead is what you saying a low level should do? I have plenty of steel now.
---
As far as I can tell from the info reported on threads so far, as well as my own poking around with FO76Edit, this only affects the Harpers Ferry vendor - the plans are available from other sources and vendors as well.

Even if the issue is with the leveled list itself (meaning all vendors that sell those plans are bugged), you can still get them from quests and events. I got mine from Event: Patrol Duty, but I also got other ranged plans from some of the quests I listed there. Event: Uranium Fever seems another popular choice for getting the plans.
---
YES I totally agree and will work on punctuation. The reason I did not include DR/ER resist as of right now because of the research i would need to do in order to cover EVERYTHING from over repair to regular repair DR/ER. I also did not include X-o1 necause i do not think he would have known about it but am trying to find a way he can recover some, Basically this was a rough idea of how i wanted to cover a n PA guide since all the websites have minor to little information regarding PA repair costs with perks and without
---
Kabooooom, we need people like you lol
---
Where is any evidence at all of them duping? Any evidence of them doing anything other than hanging out at a camp? Lmao 
---
What about all the issues discovered during the B.E.T.A.? Or the decision to release a buggy product right before a known downtime? They had since October to fix a lot of issues that are still around.
---
All this time where they are with their families and spending downtime is also the exact same time that everyone is just starting to explore and enjoy their game. It's never a good idea to release a software product that you don't have 100% faith in right before you are going to leave it sitting for a while.
---
And while I'm not expecting or demanding everything to get fixed immediately, it is a good thing for issues to be continuously brought up. Without a spot light on issues, it's easy for Bethesda to get away with doing the bare minimum possible. They used to be able to rely on modders to fix all their shit and now it's come time to pay that bill.
---
I actually have two modes in which I play, one is powergamer, one is the friendly neighbour. As powergamer, I only consider activities that seem to be the most profitable. As friendly neighbour, I just wander around the map and help others. This way I get satisfaction from several different areas - the exploration and roleplay of the friendly neighbour, and the competitiveness and challenge of striving to be meta.
---
Looks like you broke him.
---
You are correct. The person using the glitch only needs to crash themselves out. In fact tanking the whole server would actually work against the glitch. The entire thing relies on having someone on your team as an anchor so you can get back into the exact same server to access the exact same world container. Infact I'm pretty sure most folks doing the glitch are not using anything but a world container since bags are well known to bug out. About 5-10mins of research would eliminate so much of this subs drama
---
Curious but, shouldn't they *not* be stacked if that's the case?
---
Inventory management hasn't changed all that much since the MUSH days... (Or UO)
---
Only thing I could think of offhand for they being stacked now, but not later, is there's a hidden ownership tag that is lurking for the possibility of that specific change taking place. But again, I don't know why that would do anything *until* it's traded away. Kinda wish they *would* let how inventory work be known because something about that feels really off. Now *mass dropping* those, however (like with a macro), outside of a text based game, that would force rendering each on a spot individually, so I could imagine that causing a slowdown the same way 4chan trolling Second Life goes.
---
It just really shouldn't be affecting anything while still in inventory in my experience. Especially since they can't be damaged.
---
The guy or girl has about forty turrets showing in that area picture. The most you can place down in your camp with building anything else is 10. So the guy would have had to abuse the bug at least twice to get that many. 
---
i mean...it's a reference to the Manhattan project.
---
Excavator is an adventure armor, not a boss fight armor. Our only boss fight now is the queen IMO.

20 atoms when they hit 7600 hours!

we should be able to walk over them mfers with our power armor on

I’ve tried, can’t seem to get anything to post without it flagging saying my post is invalid
---
yeah i said the same thing but i got downvoted. like, she's level 31 in a game, wow, ok, why do i care? because she had some mean boyfriends who said she sucked at games and now she's average?

it got gilded like 2 times too lol.

Cool, I asked what your point was
---
Way to go Vault-Dad!
---
You said if you can't play a game the way it is meant to be played, don't play it.
---
Mods are not part of a game. Do you think if someone uses mods in a game the are cheating?
---
I honestly thought I was the only one who collected and sold those outfits
---
Charisma perk can add 15% in a group.
---
Maybe if all they ever do is force spawn nuked white springs, then maybe i see them this lvl but still thats an exploit to. No way its legit
---
Looks like we keep missing each other. What is your user?
---
I'm not the OP, dipshit
---
Duping requires someone on a team to act as an anchor in a server. If they crashed the server and not just themselves there would be no duped items since you have no way to retrieve the items on the now lost instance 
---
Well, they said only Wanted players would pay their bounties with their own caps. Turns out they lied.
---
Yes
---
Yeah. Happens all the time, sadly.
---
Bump
---
Thanks! I've moved 2 points with my last 2 level-ups, and 8 seems OK. Cheers!
---
You have not, however that does not mean there may be ways to do so in future, there is evidence that display containers for armor, power armor, weapons, magazines and bobbleheads are coming, so why not other types of displays. 
---
However you will never likely be able to personally place items like you could in F4, due to the fact we now have a server to deal with, but maybe in the future, you will be able to place misc/junk items like static props into your C.A.M.P, these would become uninteractable and unstealable, etc.
---
 Yes, and it's fine to use identifying information for reporting cheaters directly to Bethesda. But us players have no way to check that, so reddit is not the place for it.  It's ripe for abuse, which is why it's not allowed. 
---
If that was the case then... why do we need "mob justice"? Send reports of cheating to Bethesda, don't share it online for a witch hunt.
---
I wonder whats going to happen once they fix this issue.
---
Can someone explain why a low level tagging the queen makes it near impossible to finish? I legitimately do not know why.
---
Not saying this dude did, but there was a pretty big XP glitch with traps that got patched. Could have easily exploited that. Someone else posted a picture of someone who was over level 1000 (One Thousand) I’m here a couple days ago. 
---
On the plus side, GTA Online survived as one of the most popular games for almost an entire console generation. So hopefully once Bethesda fixes these exploits, things will settle down. 
---
Have fun getting banned then. Because that's 100% against the TOS. 
---
If that's your play style keep it. Don't let's some jerks ruin gaming for you. 
---
My wife plays the same as you, I don't give her shit for it, Instead I clear the adds and she does all the exploring work. We work together in the games we play. In different games she has a different play style from the average player, I try to compliment her play style or she does to me but we have fun together, don't let your play style discourage you from having fun. That being said I would recommend the Splitter Cell game series as it plays in your style and super fun. Also find d a guy that likes to co-op play. You might find that you can compliment each other. If you need advice or questions PM me.
---
Launched and starting the event soon.
---
Wow this is fantastic! 
---
it's because it's super cringe. "hey you're the same gender as me ! wow you have a vagina and you play video games, wow !".
---
what the fuck? lol
---
Just got on your server. yellowtail. 
---
Yes, you can. It’s a common strategy to get more damage (30% vs 20%) for the same 3 perk points. 
---
if i were to say r/woosh would i be doing it right? 
---
&gt; "poor 'victim' of the Internet is jailed for breaking the Terms of Service."
---
FTFY : ^ )
---
Haven't tried it yet, I sold them both before that became known. But based on performance with other weapons, it would still suck - the mr. handy blade is much better and a decent legendary one with the damage buff was still eh
---
I don’t use chems except for roleplay purposes, like my whiskey-drinkin’ cowboy of a Courier or my Psychojet-addicted Sole Survivor who hasn’t taken this whole apocalypse thing well.
---
Courier hangs out with Cass a lot though, so her addiction doesn’t matter that much.
---
Fair enough. If you enjoy that way, good for you dude.
---
I have plans for Ultracite Torso and Ultracite explosive vent
---
that...isn't what incels believe.
---
It's very possible. 
---
I said people are making money... *selling* on Ebay. Not that **I'm** selling on Ebay.
---
Even if I did, I wouldn't get banned. No one is getting banned for duping. And if they do, they can write and essay and be unbanned! Yay!
---
Exactly so. It seems like rather than tackling the difficult problem through more costly means like ebay crackdowns, legal action against capfarm sites, etc they're just content to let legitimate customers suffer.
---
Great post thank you for sharing!
---
The Queen has Resistance and HP based on how many people are fighting her. So if around 10 people are fighting her, and 3 people only doing decent damage, she is near impossible to kill. Because she gains alot of HP etc. 
---
Shhhhhh.  No one realizes this.
---
I guess I should have put the "/s" after all.
---
They held the open beta to stress test the servers. They should be good! /s
---
Perhaps it meant 1 day remaining?
---
*optimism intensifies*
---
It's like you spent the time leading up to the games release under a rock and baked off your ass.
---
Pretty sure I get like 254 boards every time I clear a super mutants area, doesn't seem all that out of ordinary...
---
I think next lvl it's 20.... 
---
There are trade discord servers. I have a discord server for my group of friends and then fallout 76 subreddit has a discord, info in the subreddit info bar. 
---
Is this duping thing only on PC?  I’ve never run into this on console. Legitimate question. 
---
I can't say that I'm 100% positive. 
---
Maybe someone else will chime in. 
---
If you want to play as a mutant with, say, seven particular mutations you could:
---
1.   Buy them from a certain in-game vendor for around 28,000 (7 at 4,000 each) which, given the vendor cap limits would require grinding for 28 days (1,200 per day minus fast travel costs);
---
2.  Continuously radiate/irrradiate yourself and server hop doing so until blessed by RNG;
---
3.   Buy them from a real-person vendor for around 300 caps each and get back to playing.  
---
I’ll take option three.  
---
It was worth it - I love how you’re the idiot in his view.
---
It is not, unfortunately.
---
&gt;Let's say you have a glass cannon guns build
---
I said I have literally zero defensive perks, and I have never found myself even come close to needing more defense than Excavator gives.
---
The stuff about carry capacity is all well and good but doesn't change my point that right now there just isn't that much difficult content in the game.
---
OMG this is the nicest post on Reddit this made me happy
---
Or you could use all 3 at max rank and have even more damage 
---
So first off harry potter was terrible and dobby was weak so … yeah that needs a mention .. also a lot of my friends break my stones cause I'm apparently a psychopath in most games which is BS cause I'm actually 'strategic' so jokes on them I know myself better than them. Just tell yourself, like I do, the reason you don't rush into things and take your time killing things and sneak around all over is cause this is a survival game where gear needs to be repaired, wounds need to be tended and ammo needs to be replaced so you're playing the 'strategic' way and will outlive the degenerates, maybe say it out loud while you're playing or walking down the street anywhere public, where people can hear.
---
Btw... Are you on pc?
---
How can it be accurate? We are now analysing a statistical relation without firsthand access to the data sources, so there is a degree of inaccuracy in this that just cannot be denied (i.e. having a 0.0001% chance that hits ONCE is better than having a 0.01% that never actually hit).  
---
I tried to search for this information for you, but I failed, I can only reiterate what I read, but not only this has been researched thoroughly by the people who investigated that, as I said, I play the game with two PCs and I loot monsters twice and I already looted more stuff on my low-luck level 20 character than on my 15-luck level 160 main I put hundreds of hours into.  
---
You are free to say that this is simply an anecdotal evidence without any value as a proof, and in fact, I cannot deny that, as I do not have all the data that was gathered by people who used actual scientific approach to measure that.  
---
But for now I just gonna continue killing monsters on PC1 and looting them mostly from PC2, because, you know, good loot.
---
Oooooooh 
---
Well, Bethesda knew exactly when they were releasing FO76 and they knew exactly why.  They are completely culpable for not planning around their scheduled release.
---
Aren't you a little young to be playing games like Fallout 76?  It's rated MA15+ here in Australia.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Y56qKE6](https://imgur.com/a/Y56qKE6)
---
No because it's r/woooosh but other than that, yes
---
They have to it else...
---
 Why the hell did they give us all these good damn shelves. I've got so so many tables and display cases. If they didn't do anything with them I'd be even more confused why'd they put them in at all.
---
Them existing at all makes me believe they'll add it at some point 
---
You need the perk cards to be able to craft better stuff I believe
---
Damnit that face was supposed to be a smirk face. 
---
I’ll go home now.
---
Even with high end weapons and good builds it gets very hard lol :(
---
Read the instructions for posting
---
What do you believe, then, 'Femicide'?
---
But there's no way to know if this is malicious. There's no way to know if they were having fun with a bug or intentionally trying to crash a server.
---
I did lol i can’t figure it out
---
Recommendation don't stress it and just play. Armor really isn't that mandatory till later in the game. If your a PC player message me I'll help you out if you need! 
---
What's really funny is A tuba isn't even a fucking wind instrument.
---
This is the kind of approach that I try to have on my own. I mean, there are so many ways to have fun, especially in sandbox, who am I to define what is the right way or what is wrong? All I can say is that if you want to achieve result X then path A1 may be more effective than C3.
---
You can use standard, expert, and heavy all together at max rank. It’s a little less efficient than just one rank in each, uses a lot of points, but if you’re looking to max your output that’s the way to go. 
---
Noted. The next time someone nukes fissure site prime and I'm heading there for flux I'll wait til after the queen is dead. 
---
Thx for the tip man
---
With 2 of my friends I can kill her in 4minutes, she has a 30min timer
---
I was thinking more of the +17,000,000 units of leather and wood.
---
My name on PSN is deadpelican
---
&gt; Even if I did, I wouldn't get banned.
---
It'd be one thing if it was just duping. But this is duping AND selling the duped weapons for money. Something that is 100% against the Terms of Service. 
---
&gt;And if they do, they can write and essay and be unbanned! Yay!
---
Not how that works. 
---
“I Am Become Proud”
---
Well i believe this was one of the very early ones. I was pushing that they needed to swing the ban hammer hard before it gets worse.
---
Most likely the duper was scared to lose his account. So in their own way tried to defend it and explain that they must be a legit thing that Bethesda put in the game lol...
---
I truly depise exploiters and will raise this opinion of mine every chance i get it until its sorted. 
---
Don't be lame. 
---
God dayum. I'm guessing you guys are maxed out with TSE weapons or godly melee weapons. 
---
Same. I just hit 200 tonight. Solo nuke runs to bomb white springs to farm legendries can do a lot for the xp bar. I play casual as well. I stopped trying to level at 100. Now it is just a byproduct of doing the only rewarding thing that can be done in endgame.
---
Those 5.56 were a long time of blood, sweat, lead hunting, robot killing, and many hours of munition factory takeovers and defending. Exhausting.
---
It sounds so sad lol :( Would love to fix it so you can join in the fight without problems
---
Yeah they’ve got to play more than me and I’m almost everyday/ all day. But the level 1000 has to be using a glitch or something.  I’ve duped like once or twice but it’s only for ammo/water. The guys who dupe guns n shit are ridiculous.
---
make me 
---
They BRIEFly came back, you say? :P
---
Did a similar thing happen to you?
---
Yeah, don't enter PvP against someone using it. You won't even have time to run. Or blink.
---
Hey , who puts these onions right here ? 
---
Probably going to let us have tamed animals And robots follow.us first
---
 Which im all about 
---
It's been a well known issue since the beta. Don't spam the add key, pay attention to what you're adding. 
---
It's so crazy that this is a thing. What happened to just playing the game? Some guy called me lazy the other day because I don't have marsupial. He said I didn't know how to play right. I'm like, it's my guy, with the backstory I created. By definition I am always right in how I play. He just kept telling me I was a bad gamer.
---
No. But the point remains. this is clearly against the terms of service, the only way anyone could make a headline like that is if they just hopped on the bethesda hatewagon and refused to look into the issue objectively. 
---
Bad coding comes from developers and creates bugs. I fail to see why we shouldn't blame the developers for poor management of their own game.
---
Evil has a very broad definition in the wastes.
---
This explains the guy that tried giving me 3000+ Nuka quantum. I took like 50 and dumped the rest out of his sight. 
---
Was wondering wtf
---
What platform you on?
---
I know.... I just need to vent
---
Yeah lol using prime TSE combat shotgun, handmade mostly, all dmg perk cards maxed etc etc
---
Can confirm. I play a power armored heavy weapons train build and don't catch a quarter of the loot my friends seem to find just lying around.
---
now kiss
---
They're not evil. They are just *concerned*. Just like Anakin was concerned about Padme, so he ended up killing every single padawan and becoming Darth Vader.
---
How is that even possible wtf
---
Obviously there's a difference between QOL mods and outright cheating.
---
I think interacting with other players and giving them interesting stories to pass along is also rewarding, if not more so.  
---
Not everyone wants to be X-Men buillds, heck i took all of them off. It was funny for a little but they really don't feel that Fallout style if that makes sense.
---
Seeing people air walk is just really meh.
---
No you don't, shut up with that crap. 
---
You are telling me you slow walk EVERYWHERE just because you like to hoard? Slowing the progress of playing down to like 10% normal speed at all times because it's that enjoyable for you? 
---
I get like 200-400 steel an hour normally playing. I'm not going to do the math, but that's a metric shit ton of hours just fucking slow walking. Let alone the fact that you would have to be solely focused on just collecting rather than the myriad of other stuff to do.
---
You deserve to be banned if that's how you are playing this lol. 
---
I’ll be fifty this year (and a complete fallout junkie)and can’t get my twenty year olds to play with me on a regular basis -even though I got them all power frames ,mining hats with bright lights, gas masks , hunting rifles at level 2 so we could have a great start like a good dad does, providing for his family . And yet they won’t even jump on with the old man because they are to busy playing COD and Destiny!!!!
---
 this was a great story and it made me feel better about life . I thank you!!!
---
All the time. I've lost so many caps because of this.
---
People like you need to find something better to do with your time than act high and mighty, like find a job and stop mooching off mom. You throw words around like anecdotal and put on made up statistics to sound smart.. You keep believing what you want the only thing I've found solid proof of for better loot is stop one shotting enemies and start letting their health refill, I have actual video proof of that working and I did the research myself. Until you can give me proof I do not believe you and im not going to continue arguing with you over something this stupid. If you think you are meta fine. Gold sells for 7 each with the right barter perks and I have 300+ as well as 300+ silver does that make me more meta than you? I've also found more Tse weapons so I must be better than you right? Look into the letting their health refill thing, trust me. You can respect points around and no person running meta uses 15 luck anyway so I'm starting to doubt your authenticity. 
---
No.
---
Are you triggered?  You sound triggered...
---
You have to use the perk points before the card will show. If it shows at pevel 46 and he is 52 and has 8 points saved, he would need to use 2 perk points to actually reveal the card. The cards dont reveal unless you have spent the points required for that level.
---
Yeah we allow digital goods. I enjoy taking those calls at work because I can typically spot a thief. If I see it was something like this or pirated content, I escalate. If it's someone trying to rip off a legitimate seller, I deny their claim.
---
That's a nice speech but I still don't see Bethesda taking action.
---
I would be fine if they just pulled legendaries from the game period. At least reduced the damage ones by like 80%. The whole magic weapons and armor thing is stupid.
---
Sounds like how i play. Im nearly that level and fucked if id take on a level 40 scorchbeast!
---
Ohhh oh yeah, definitely a duper. Not sure how I missed those ;)
---
Looks like Bethesda don't care about their own ToS, then.
---
Well I may have that wrong, I might as well go and see how to do it, it's not like I play anymore lol. Cheers though I may be misunderstood but I was under the impression a server crash was required for at least one duping method.
---
You need to ask yourself, what am I going to do with 25 fusion cores?  Then drop 15-20 on the ground because you have no use for them. There is no reason to stash any ammo. If you can’t use it trade it to someone for ammo you can use or drop it for a new player. 
---
Adrenal reaction can add a lot of damage to your build. The lower the health the more the benefit. It is a high risk high reward build. Healing factor only heals you when you are out of combat so You will be squishy.
---
I may if been wrong it looks like i have the small letter set. 
---
Still i wouldn't spend more than a thousand caps at any given vendor seems too ridiculous.
---
I'd by tue neon letters in a heart beat though xD
---
I doubt it...what’s the point when you can have humans? 
---
Seems like it would cheese PvP too since they can’t die.
---
Which, I would point out, is what brought us Luke, so there's a silver lining to even that cloud. :P
---
This, lol. I have 3000 caps right now. Been playing since beta and it's the most I've ever had. I'd have less but I stopped buying plans because I can't remember what I have and am tired of getting doubles.
---
They dupe the Nuka and mass drink them as each one gives one cap each. So you can hit the 25k fast then throw a few 100,000 on an alt for when you want more caps.
---
Plus 25k caps go for about 37 dollars.
---
Valid levels for leather armor are 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50. If you can't craft level 10 then something is broken, but 15 doesn't exist.
---
Low levels are special for crafting. After that, there are 10-level gaps. Some gear also goes 5/15/25/35/45 instead of 10/20/30/40/50.
---
Perks that mitigate or avoid damage.
---
Serendipity, dodgy, etc.
---
If you're having a laugh at the expense of me crafting my helmets - its okay. I just described a recipe that outputs 5x caps worth of material investments, and which allows you to get to tens of thousand of caps of daily income, together with a method of how to circumvent the vendor cap pool limit, all without any duping.  
---
So yeah, please, correct my understanding of what meta-gaming is.
---
Pump shotgun, sorry I forget there’s others lol
---
I must be a real tank to carry all my Gatlin, Flamer, Cryo, and .50CAL, even with perks.
---
This makes me what to stop playing. 
---
I'm pretty sure the floor mats only work in the workshops and I don't think there's a way you can do it in c.a.m.p.
---
I have a friend kind of in the opposite position. The guy literally pre-ordered the power armor edition the moment it was available. Bought copies for his Xbox and pc before any of our friends bought our copies. He was hyping it up but when the first bit of negative feedback appears, the guy starts hating on the game. Didn't play the beta cause he was busy while our group of friends played and had fun despite some bugs. Before the game launched, he kept saying it was a bad game cause other said so and questioned our sanity. Game launches and plays at most 2-3 hours finding shit to confirm his bias that it was a bad game and never played again. Nowadays we kind of talked less cause the rest of group of friends find it annoying for him to join and tell us how bad taste we have and to stop playing a dead game. All this coming from the guy that bought the game before anyone else in our group. 
---
Have seen Grahm loads by the Mistress of Mysteries mansion and The Whitespring! 
---
Poseidon energy camp allows you to build an extractor 
---
Where did this exist 20 years ago? This glitch requires multiplayer... I'd love to know what multiplayer creation engine game exited 20 years ago.
---
Sure, one day remaining. But that was weeks ago, if we're talking about the Blackbird paint or whatever.
---
Nope, no sights either (even a front sight for that matter).Not sure why they did that to potentially one of the coolest guns in the game.
---
Going to take a workshop or owning one automatically flags you for pvp. It says this when you claim it. When someone else comes to claim it, they are automatically flagged for pvp as well.
---
Found the gaslighter.
---
If you ever want to join, we nuke Whitesprings sometimes aswell, just join me. So you can farm some levels!
---
I dont understand dupers...
---
I mean i would be insanly BOARD doin this
---
(Please end my suffering)
---
but i want you to. 
---
Sounds like you're the only *actual* Fallout player in this story. There's a stealth mechanic for a reason. I've always believed that's how the game is meant to be played. Slow, steady, and thought out.
---
Watoga medical 
---
Oh so the "being allergic to letters" is an asshole remark, especially under "tl;dr this mother fucker" comment?  
---
Delusional?
---
I have been getting disconnected periodically currently I'm connected but have no quest markers or quests in my data tab.
---
This! Thanks my guy for coming with the actual right answer. Got me a full house band at my CAMP now! If only I had some friends to play the other instruments :(
---
Thx guys that was fun
---
Im on PSN too! I have been roaming alone bc no one wants to take their time with the game, &amp; bc I'm a girl, guys show up to tell me what to do in an area or quest instead of just letting me figure it out &amp; it takes the fun out of it :( 
---
Dear Diary.....
---
So is this why when I'm crafting like 2000+ .45 caliber ammo I get major lag spikes? And does this mean I'm hurting the server I'm on when craft a lot of ammo or bulk?
---
Seems pretty dumb that a basic game mechanic would hurt the game..🙁
---
*FO76 has one major glitch remaining*
---
&gt;Amazing that a game this incredibly unstable and buggy still has defenders...
---
*Every other major release in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2018 has major animation and physics issues, including Spiderman and RDR2, the most highly acclaimed*
---
&gt; GOTY 2018!!!!
---
You are not as cool as you think you are picking on a level 24 while you are level 141. No congrats from me. 
---
Yeah it sucks. Stair thing pisses me off. Started actually using the ramps. I should be able to use other stairs but always have to use metal because it won't snap 
---
So I would have to radiate myself to a HP level I’m comfortable with (which will be squishy) to prevent health regeneration beyond that point? So I lose the -50 for having it, then I take my health down to, say 75% using rads and then get the damage increase for whatever 75% health is. 
---
Otherwise the health regeneration and/or stimpacks (in combat) would take me to full health / no additional damage. 
---
Probably would be region locked is my guess but idk tbh
---
The fact that people gave reddit gold and platinum for this shows that there are a lot of desperate male fallout players.
---
Bug reports achieve nothing these days, you need to expose those fuckers. Chances are media will pick this up and Bethesda will resolve it sooner.
---
That doesn't prove the other guys wrong.  It's nice gesture, but let her craft her own armour.  She seems to be doing fine as is.
---
Using adrenaline perk?
---
Man I have NO idea how to build. I made a first story and was lucky enough to make a second. No matter what I did I couldn’t make a third. It’s really frustrating, it’s not you. 
---
At the very least it needs to work during the night event where you have to make as much noise as possible. If the instrument weapons being slashed works, so should my yodeling.
---
Am I doing it right?
---
Ka-KAW!!!
---
Seems that u/Anticleric deleted his comment. For anyone who is curious about what he said:
---
&gt; This is exactly the problem. Snowflake culture has killed the creative industries. You're fired.
---
Is there a bit of irony that he deleted his comment? He was literally calling people snowflakes, yet couldn't handle downvotes. Seems a tad hypocritical.
---
I didn't even think about that. Aw well, I'd rather play legitimately. 
---
I don't know if you're already aware, but once you've swapped weapons once you can hit left on the d-pad to swap back and forth between the last 2 weapons. It took me way too long to notice that.
---
There are some weird things happening with the weapons. My 10MM Auto Pistol should have 15 bullets because of the magazine I have, but it has dropped to 12 - and now even if I mod it again and put a different magazine (like that one that has 18 bullets) it won't change.
---
Meta isn't about caps in this game. It's about who has the jetpack and TSE handmade. Maybe who can kill a queen or run a silo. Everything else is remedial. You can max caps on fo76 bazaar in a day if you have the right stuff with ought duping. You didn't answer any of my questions and cant give me proof. That according to you is set in stone. 
---
Seriously doubt it
---
Even if they brought in a mechanic like jury rigging 1\*'s into a single weapon to combine the pre-fixes. That would not only make 1\* legendaries still useful and worth holding onto, but help to bypass all this rng.
---
That is a cheating duper. 100% guaranteed. Report their GT.
---
Glad to help.
---
It's a post from someone sharing her thoughts on her experience and being proud of achieving something in the game.  What the hell is wrong with that?  Maybe you're over-reacting.  I mean, you could have just ignored the thread and gone about your day, instead of feeling the need to share your opinion on it.
---
You did the right thing man. 
---
Sounds like you chose shitty boyfriends 
---
 I've never seen the beast out of his power armor. 
---
Agreed. What bothers me the most is not the 'economy,' it's the fact that they're crashing servers they DO NOT OWN and ruining the game for everyone else playing. They gave all of us and Bethesda the middle finger. Ban them all without mercy.
---
It wasn't their when I first made this. Don't act like you didn't edit this post first. Yeah he didn't call you a mother fucker. 
---
I'm level 81. What I need at this point is better weapons, to work in my end game PA (full X-01 with T60 arms), and to farm some Flux materials. I'm a PA heavy gunner build. 
---
The weapon I want the most would be a vampire's two-shot 50cal machine gun. Or Vampire's Furious 50cal machine gun. 
---
Well it won't help you survive it, but staying in melee range makes it more difficult since TSE hurt the user at point blank range
---
You play how you feel comfortable playing,
---
If you ex's got jokes about it that means they are morons but that you already know....they are your ex's
---
Girl, that is exactly what griefing is! You crazy? Also who said I'm looting everytime during a combat wave? Are you sure your brain is even attached to your head?
---
So you gave your friend an addiction and now she has missed sleep .. good job. I'm so funny I should charge, seriously though it's not hard for most people that try this game to enjoy it, it's easy actually but it also does take a particular mindset to stay though after playing it for so long. I'm a patient man with simple pleasures and am always appreciative for what people do so I stick around, but a lot of people now a days have very little patience or attention spans and require apparently more finale than show.
---
BTW melee is like eating a lot of cake, sniping is like slowly peeling off the frosting of a cupcake and eating it in pieces and mid range/shotguns/automatics is like doin whip-its. Try em all you wont be disappointed.
---
are you online now?
---
Needs to get reported first. So...instead of bitching about it here, you oughta be doing your part, bucko. Service guarantees citizenship!
---
If you're a duper you are trash.
---
ok so between my two friends and i the quest and or event "repair poseidon" gives you a random reward each time you complete the task . 
---
in any order you can get  
---
large generator 
---
wind mill 
---
fusion generator 
---
one friend got fusion the same time i got wind mill . that was a first run for the both of us , another friend received fusion on his second run . i have only done 1 run at this point . ill update my findings asap ! 
---
You, apparently.
---
Piece of advice, don't log out while doing any quest series. This can happen on all of them. 
---
It is rewarding, and I do that. I was speaking of an actual reward though. Just different kinds of rewarding. I spend most my time helping others. That usually means I have less things than I had before. Thus the need for farming. 
---
I can craft u a X-01 with extras from Perk Cards, might need some materials. I have a 2 shot Explosive .50 Cal lol
---
Nothing will work against a 3k+ DMG TSE. Even if you avoid damage *once* with Serendipity, there are more bullets coming your way.
---
Yeah, every level after 50 you can either pick a perk or move 1 SPECIAL point from one to another
---
But it sounds like too much work. 
---
Hopefully you are appearing online. The last person that posted this was offline.
---
I rushed through fallout 4. Never again 
---
please? 
---
Solution: 0lb max stash for them on all characters.
---
"But they'll just have to buy another copy."
---
Hey Bethesda - you listening to this? Im just sayin...
---
This game is dead.
---
Sorry, this game was never alive.
---
gives poison resistance
---
I stopped doing the quest after running out of screws to build the Torso, after having built every other part first. Guess I'll do some farming to finish it. Gotta get them plans. 
---
Tops to you. I’m grinding away with minimal gear and these dudes have thousands of top lvl stuff - the acquisition of which actually prevents me from playing the game (disconnects). Keep up the good work.
---
I've found them, too!  This is one of my favorite teddy bear tableaus I've found in the game so far!
---
have my upvote, and all of my love.
---
Thanks I was getting worried
---
Oh right got ya. Thanks.
---
So fix it in a mod and upload it so we can download .. wait that's legal right ….
---
I have the materials to do it. But I'm going to craft them as I get the mods. No need for a heavy piece of gear to take up space in my stash. Also I want to stay away from TSE weapons. I've killed myself more than once with explosive guns by accident. 
---
Do you happen to know the perk pack intervals
---
implying im dumb enough to buy it lmfao
---
I used only pencils found pointing east.
---
Nuking west virgina with your son has to be the most wholesome thing i read about
---
But they are being reported. You got people on the forums, on this sub, on the market sub, on Ebay selling duped items, and they don't hide that fact.
---
If Bethesda aren't aware, is because they *don't want* to be aware. After all, they already said it: there's nothing they can do to prevent this - so it's better to forget about it.
---
can i have your stuff when you go?
---
Yoga: you're doing it wrong.
---
Launched 3 nukes.  First 2 crashed.  Last one I joined a team.  Everyone crashed
---
 😪
---
4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, every 5 levels, forever and ever
---
Lol I kill myself alot, especially when im getting tired.
---
If you grind a ton you can get ten levels a day easy, even at 200+. I just can’t rinse and repeat over and over on one guy when it doesn’t really make your character stronger. I bought a second account and started team grinding so that makes it a little more interesting but after one nuke I’m ready to play something else.
---
It's a wide spread issue. Happens to my friends and I all the time. I really wonder if you were on the server where my friend was nuking. As he was nuking prime fissure it decided to crash. Hopefully it will be fixed soon! Sorry my guy, keep at it and you'll get it done!
---
I think that your attempts of suggesting me to find a job are a good marker for the relevance of your opinion, I could share you some information regarding my professional position, but you would only say that I pretend to be meta :D  
---
I rarely one-shot enemies because I always tag them when I see other players, so these other players would have access to XP and loot too.  
---
I know you didn't read the post, so you missed the point, and the point was - RNG is not acceptable as means to get god-roll loot. People should be able to craft those items, even if this crafting would be tedious, there should be a set of actions defined that will lead you to obtain item X with 100% success ratio, and the current scenario, where its 100% RNG based, where I can trick RNG to drop me five times the legal amount of loot, and where my 15luck main receives a small fraction of loot my luck&lt;5 alt that barely tags any monster receives, is just absurd.
---
Personally not a fan of Gun Fu, or anything that refreshes on kill personally. However, I don't have one of the OP TSE shotguns; so maybe it's different then. 
---
Amen
---
wait theres elder paint?
---
Lol XD
---
Seems like it might be a debounced buffer issue. If a single pull on "full auto" fires 4 rounds per tick, that's still just 1 fire instruction, followed by a "still firing" value, eventually followed by a "stop firing" value. It's not a lot of data to process server side. 
---
In a client/server setup, you have to attempt to deduplicate messages so an action isn't inaccurately applied more than once. Ex: I press fire once, it fires two bullets. Obviously not what we want.
---
So how do we prevent two bullets from firing? There's a number of ways, the cheapest would be rate limiting. Let's assume you can fire a gun once every second. To enforce this, I create a "buffer" that can hold operations the client is sending to me. At the end of a time frame, you "reduce" the buffer to contain only valid operations via some heuristic and then execute them. The heuristic defines what valid means.
---
This method is fine, but has two flaws:
---
1. It's not "idempotent" (an identical operation sent outside of the time range may still be applied twice, see original example)  
---
Note: sometimes, this is the way to go. If the chance of this occurring is statistically insignificant, it is standard to drop the data and ignore it. This area of ignored data is where many exploiters play.
---
2. It can be flooded if there's insufficient operational gates (if I send more operations than can be reduced and executed before the next 1s buffer period, it appears to "lag" because the cpu has too much work to do in a small time window)
---
This actually doesn't even do it justice because of the sheer number of operations. The actual operation is going too much, much more complicated and likely consist of an extremely large number of "buckets" as buffers that can be processed a number of different ways depending on the data itself. Suffice it to say, it's more likely flawed client code that allows the macro to exceed some normally gated input rate. I don't envy whomever has to fix it, it just turns into an arms race with exploit authors and eventually you have punkbuster.
---
Honestly I wish everyone would just look it up then folks would know what to actually look for instead of whatever this week's circus is. The servers suck and while dupers aren't helping they aren't really hurting them in the way most commenters in this sub think. Being an informed player makes you a better player don't feel shame in watching videos to know what's really going on.
---
But social media is a weapon, and the backlash someone would get immediately, even if they're not guilty would be obscene
---
It’s not poor management of a game if it has bugs. Poor management would be having the game be unplayable. This game is playable despite what lots of people say
---
True, that's why people like myself must hold onto the righteous virtues and morals founded by our leader Roger Maxson. 
---
Woohoo! Keep up the good work! Glad you got away from that negativity. 
---
What assholes, it's rare enough to find a girl that actually likes gaming (not that they don't play, but in my experience)
---
Thats the one I got.
---
Just dumb enough to hang out and comment on the subreddit of a game you didn't buy and don't play...gotcha.  Yeah, you don't sound like a 12 year old edgelord at all.
---
Hijacking to point out that gamebryo is notoriously shit at handling very high inventory counts - i've had older bethesda games crash when i opened my stash containers that where - apparently - too full.
---
When will they switch do a modern fucking engine...
---
Do the wolf pack event at the fun fare each wolf pack leader will drop a legendary so it can help to get good gear early game, get a knife and start stabbing those wolves (or whatever attack you chose)
---
Seriously? I usually get like 200 a day.
---
Try hitting the train station above Whitesprings and there is an excavator spot on the main road from Flat wood to the junkyard (north one not Charleston)
---
No lie i caught 2 people duping using a tent. I knew Derpthesda wasn't going to do anything so i stole all the stuff they were trying to dupe (like 2k Cali Shocks, and other X-01 mods, like 200k nuka-colas). They were screaming at me, I left the server.They started spamming friend requests. Dropped everything, then left the server again so it would go away lol. It was hilarious. One thing I regret is not SS'ing it, but it just happened so fast.
---
She proved them wrong that she isn't a "shit" gamer, at least in my mind. It was only a gesture. Honestly I like doing it for a lot of people I come across in game or in this Reddit. As long as they seem to be enjoying the game, seem like a good person, I figure why not share the fun. 
---
A good workshop would be Abandoned Bog Town, with 3 concrete resource sites.
---
Your not alone man they have had a major effect on all parts of the game. Worse is from what i can tell the ones i have spoken to or heard from just don't care about the game or the community at all....
---
Im online now for evaluating if you guys are available. Little_j1669
---
sure thing fatass 
---
No, people are bitching about it. They aren't reporting those specific people. Get names. 
---
I never said I couldn’t handle it without it. I’m just bringing up the point that Bethesda said they were going to do something and we haven’t heard back. And I don’t think anyone would complain if they had another 400 pounds of stash space. 
---
it sounds like a great idea until someone, for no apparent reason, puts your name on that thread.
---
Oh you got me. I said something in the heat of the moment on Reddit, realized I didn't really mean it and didn't want hate, removed it and you got me good.
---
Slow clap
---
Well I certainly wouldn't stick around some dude who called me 'shit' at games.
---
I don't blame dupers, I blame bethesda for releasing such a broken mess. I used to know how the old exploits were done I just haven't kept up with the latest exploits etc. because it's not worth it to me anymore (the game that is).
---
I agree far too much blame is being laid on dupers/exploiters instead of the spaghetti code.
---
I did that when I was rebuilding and expanding my camp - got all the concrete I needed in around 30 minutes.
---
Id love to test out like full assassin padded set with perks and mutations, could be best bet

I have Marsupial, Speed Demon, and Herd Mentality. Gearing to get all mutations except herbivore and Empath.
---
I heard they use the board to create ammo, but the quantity is suppose to be greater then 300...
---
whitesprings, nuke zones.
---
Tell me more about how you can drop 5× the loot on one enemy? You need to quit your bullshit. We are done here. You can't give proof, at this point I don't think you even play the game and are just a troll or someone living some sort of fantasy out. 
---
Unless you think everyone who reads this is a duper, your title is stupid.
---
That's happened to me twice. It is the worst. You still get the rewards for the quest at least.
---
Rads are a good way to keep your health low. Nerd rage and serendipity help keep you alive at low health. Low health builds are risky, but not as risky for rifles. And you will use a lot of stimpacks and nuka colas. Unless you can stay far enough away to stay untouched.
---
Or just white springs, could find some upgrades there
---
Same here, that was my favorite helmet in 4 too - Danse always had one on.
---
The only good ghouls are the ones that stay in their stinkin’ holes!
---
Like the other guy explained, Bethesda is terrible at building a multiplayer game in their ancient engine. I've uninstalled the piece of shit for now.
---
In it's current state it's really bad. At least in watoga all the bots could kill it, while I and a few other players took some pot-shots, then ran in for it's drops, but near the insane asylum like 3 spawned in along with a horde of high-leveled scorched. That mixing with the fact I was over encumbered, and really needed my junk, didn't fare well, as I was relativle low level compared to them.
---
Didn't help that some highlevel dude was sitting in the corner, not doing anything, not even repairing our one saving grace, the anti air ordnance. Watching me get curbstomped.
---
Ugh, at least he didn't join in on the curbstomping though, outside of workshops (and even then it's only happened once) the community seems pretty tame.
---
(Bravo, I'm impressed! That was very well written, thanks for your time and effort)
---
Thank you!

u/imprezobus
---
I don’t agree with duping but I agree with your response.
---
Too many people on this subreddit direct their ire at other players taking advantage of this shitty excuse for a game.
---
Bethesda is 100% at fault here. The lack of response or even *acknowledgment* regarding this issue indicates two things: 1) they don’t know how to fix the duping; 2) they’re aware of it and working on a hotfix to patch this but don’t want to give the official stamp of approval that this issue exists (just like they didn’t acknowledge the WC glitch until their mentioned that they fixed it in yhe patch notes).
---
This is unacceptable either ways but the fact that Bethesda has all the chances in the world to come in and officially state that duping and the previous WC glitch were responsible for server instability would give them a free pass to deflect some blame from their incompetence. The fact they’re not doing it indicates it’s probably unrelated.
---
I quit the game two days ago anyways. I got Level 88 and got two Instigating Explosive weapons and everything dies in on hit. There’s nothing to do but server hop, go to Whitesprings, clear, find a server with a nuke zone and do that for hours upon hours. Over it and now I can go back to finish other games which don’t have these issues.
---
Wow those are some mean boys. Don't anyone mock you for how you play the game. We all play in our own ways and have our own ways of having fun. I play the same exact way you do and I have had friends mock me for it. I just like to explore mainly. 
---
I find it hard to play Fallout76 with people because a lot of people want to rush or move quickly. I like to read all the little notes, listen to the holotapes and etc.
---
Wish I did have people to play with though cause I don't like fighting ghouls or exploring scary places alone.
---
The game does not come with a mouse either - if I use a mouse, am I cheating?
---
Jesus fucking Christ - the devs are incompetent at GUI design, fixing those flaws is \*\*\*NOT CHEATING\*\*\*.
---
Did you try automatic? Not to defend beth or anything just curious. 
---
I’m not. It’s launched btw.
---
I’m talking I was trading with someone in a friends camp. And the she even traded me a weapon. With a value of 109 damage per bullet and 2 minutes after value dropped to 66 damage. 
---
I have now defeated the queen for the 10th time today, I know it's not much, but I am certain I am not supposed to keep receiving the same plans again and again. 
---
Everytime I take down the scorchqueen beast, I get a 1 star legendary, usually ghouls slayer wooden leg, and the same plans which are the explosive vent and the helmet for the ultracite power armor.
---
Am I doing something wrong, or am I supposed to only get the same rewards again and again? Is it based on my special stat Luck? Since I hope it's a bug that I keep receiving the same reward for defeating the END GAME boss, I'm reporting it here. 
---
On a personal note, I cannot believe how unrewarding it is to pour thousands of rounds of ammo into a scorchbeast queen, and get absolutely nothing useful. I get more useful items by completing a daily mission, and that ain't saying much.
---
If by now it's not obvious, they don't know the particulars. They came out with a patch, maybe few weeks ago I don't remember openly stating they fixed the exploit that allowed duping, publicly, with confidence enough to state it on a public website but clearly were not code level deep in finding the solution .. they basically hit up youtube and figured they secured it.
---
Either the dev(s) responsible to fix it just took the quick way out and lied to management or they really don't have the staff to actually jump deeper into code to debug any longer to find the actual causes for bugs. Either way it's still funny.
---
Yeah definitely weird stuff is goin on
---
After you place your camp you can move the C.A.M.P module around your camp area to change where you spawn from fast travel, this does take a decent amount of trying to get it right. I was spawning inside a cliff and I had to move my module to the other side of my camp to fix it.
---

---
Junk extracors give scrap not junk. You harvest a junk pile manually to get junk.
---
I heard about duping - but if this pic is not fake, I think I actually will get a refund - this is so bullshit.
---
If a team of players was playing on that server. And there was a nuke earlier you Glitch the game and keep glowies spawn at Whitesprings almost forever if you know what your doing. That how people hit the high levels like 300 or more.
---
I usually hit watoga high school (cafeteria/kitchen/upstairs dining) then hit Morgantown high school (gym/cafeteria/hallways for pumpkins) then the crazy cat lady's house up the road from the high school. Round trip around 220 plastic if everything is spawned.
---
If Bethesda doesn't do anything about all the cheats and exploits soon I'm dumping this game.
---
I'd love to see video of this. I have a TSE Pump Shotgun and I thought about run a build like this. 
---
FO76 was only easy for me because im good at ark and dark souls. A few of my experienced gamer friends had trouble with fo76 tho, dont feel bad lol
---
Did you just buy a new Fedora? Surprised you didn’t end that with “ M’lady”
---
I'd love a way to reliably gift things. The pace I play at and the sheer number of junk drops you get late in the game means I drop stuff constantly. 
---
Like plans I'd give u all my extra plans for her empty camp. I wish there were a thrift store or something that sold items put into it at a discount.
---
or like a "donation" box in flatwoods or something. You could easily write it in with the lore. Maybe bundle things donated into care packages given to players for the first few levels
---
Here here. I like this idea, like a lot. 
---
You are welcome.

Some of us are trying to save you .. FROM YOURSELF!
---
I feel like it will be fixed next patch. Just gotta be patient
---
Thats still not how it works. I do 1-2% TOPS against a lvl40 with a TSE black dragon with psycho tats, crit, and stealth if they are not flagged. I have tested it for a previous thread I was in, and 100% of the time from levels 30-50ish it was the same thing.
---
Well I can’t argue with that. 
---
Did you get it digitally or disk?
---
Honestly, that system would be really neat! I'd be all for it if they added it
---
That's stupid.
---
It's not all regular scorch beasts. It only happens every once in a while for me 
---
I know the plan for pump shotguns I can build you the Prime receiver you provide the mats and a tip.
---
Are you still doing this?
---
WTF
---
I'd probably let it go for 700 to 1500 caps. Ive found 3 TS shottys on my own. After a while they just take up room in my inventory 
---
You get free legendaries from quests. There are a few YouTube guides on how to acquire &amp; complete them.
---
Quest rewards should always be the highest level you can currently equip.
---
Are you making sure to hit all 7 faction vendors to sell loot - 1400 caps a day per character. 
---
Always hit nuke zones, even if only to pick the flora to sell on your vendor run.
---
Grow tato/corn/mutfruit &amp; have water purification (preferably on water with industrial &amp; fusion powered). That covers food &amp; adhesive - both for personal use &amp; vendoring.
---
Sell all the loot you have before buying from a vendor. Helps raise that daily cap for caps a bit.
---
Check world spawns for free PA mods.
---
Just two shot? If so, maybe 400-500 caps if you're patient.
---
I think people have mixed up scaled HP and scaled resist. I have not crunched Numbers but my experiance is that the difference to dmg Done to her is huge depending on how many players are there.
---
Lvl 220 and starting to get really bored by the Queen overall so hoping for more end game stuff soon. And new gear/tiers
---
Ok thanks
---
hahah solid 12 year old's comeback...keep going...
---
If you are lucky enough to get a quad/furious (I did today) with automatic barrel it tears up scorchbeasts. Just burns thru fc's fast.
---
Message me on Xbox @Skippsy 
---
How much do you want to bet someone made 305 boards 
---
Market is flooded with TSE weapons rest sell cheap if at all.
---
Find a low level Furious dagger, give it to someone with min/low strength and no melee perks, then have them attack a friend who isn't weaing any armor.  Make sure to be in pvp so you don't need to account for the slap damage.  And make sure the one being hit has a nice stack of stimpacks.
---
Have the friend open the pipboy and monitor their health from the status menu(which they can use stimpacks from when they get low on health.  Have them take note on what there health was before and after being hit.  The calculate to see how much damage he was taking and reverse calculate for the % increase.  You can also see if at some point it caps or not.
---
Or you can assume it works the same as it did in FO4, where it caps on the 11th hit(10 damage increases) and it compound damage by roughly 15%.
---
Yeah it disappeared after a few minutes.
---
I had some warden robots attack me in the toxic waste while gathering herbs. It led to a quest in the prison that i'd never seen before. This happened to me at level 300ish. Game crashed towards the end of the quest so i didn't get to complete it.
---
Always thought Kingdom of Loathing had a great way to deal with that in the form of "sinks", basically once they fix duping, having small but enormously expensive events that cost them their dupes. So you had an item trade ratio of at times 1000000:1 completely wiping out large segments of dupes at once. Yeah, sure, it "temporarily rewards them" but that was the whole point psychologically. People (especially cheaters) just can't resist non-permanent e-peen awards. They willingly gave up their illicit goods for completely useless display items, that were worth only a single "meat" (cap) when auto sold. After around 6 of these events (one example being you could write a message on one brick in a wall at a time, at a cost of around $250000 per letter), the market has been clean for a whole decade. A new exploit was found after the 4th, but the next two wiped out those + the original targets, as the newer exploit only worked on consumables. Whatever made it through was eventually used up by the regular player base alongside legit consumables. Only people who have any dupe items are dead accounts that got bored long ago. (Buying the monthly real money donation items prevents account deletion, ever)
---
that's right you little piggy suck on those gamer gurl toes
---
I found handmade Gun plans at level 25 at Harpers Fairy. On another Character found handmade gun plans at the BOS Phoenix bot. I also found them with my original Character on Grahm at level 60. 
---
Actually very well written, I don't think there were any of the issues you mentioned at the end, unless I skipped over them. 
---
As for the sources, I think you're right with it being anything. I got a mutation earlier today from eating some food. It seems to be random, too; I've gotten marsupial 3x already, egg head and herbivore 2x, a couple others 1x, and never gotten many of them yet. With such a low sample size that can easily be explained by random variation.
---
As for the serum issues, I can confirm that at least herbivore does not prevent you from getting effects since I used a marsupial serum yesterday (yeah despite getting it 3x naturally, I keep having terrible luck losing it instantly due to fat fingered radaway or trying to get rid of others) and got it while already being an herbivore. I don't know for sure but I think I recall some patch notes saying they fixed that issue
---
Why do people think you have to just plow through? Games are fun when you do some exploring.
---
Eh you live and learn man 
---
I lost my camp about 8Xs before they changed it on the plus side I got really good/fast rebuilding my camp and discovered new better ways and places to build
---
Your ex bfs suck at gaming. They fucking piss me off. You need to find a guy who plays your way haha! Taking your time and exploring is what games are all about. That is why I don't play with people. I have to talk to everybody and see everything and ain't nobody got time for that but me. 
---
Having the abiluty to simply create what you need with endgame mats would be better.
---
All my friends have ps4 pros and brag that it's the best consoles on the market then show me stuff like this all the time and say it happens it's how tech works I domt understand them but why does ps4 have issues with fallout seems like 90 % of issues is ps4 
---
And the multiple thousand of several bobble heads. Must’ve missed those too. 
---
If you got it on disk, inside the case should be a code to enter to receive the items. If purchased digitally, I’m not quite sure but check the store and see if you have any available add-ons. Hope it gets sorted out. 
---
heh, creampies.
---
Ahahha blue screen of death.
---
Does it show as bought / owned in the atomic shop?
---
Go to an armor workbench - you are saying they aren't listed there as craftable items?
---
You've redeemed the additional code that came w/your copy?
---
You'll have to wait on Bethesda at this point :/ Hopefully someone else who's gone through it successfully replies.
---
Quoting the sole survivor I see?

Damn son! Good thing I didnt have a girlfriend before I bought FO 76. 😎
---
The guy on the left is not over. he was just saying the dude with 1m wood alone + other is lagging it out
---
It's with other games too. When black ops 4 launched a vast majority of the crashes were ps4 bluescreens
---
I personally sneak all around for various reasons. I like to use the sneak status as an enemy detection system, where if I feel like there might be an enemy near by, I enter sneak mode and see if it goes into caution or not. I also use it because I play a character primarily built around stealth-ranged attacks. I also just like to get the drop on enemies to minimize personal damage, as I’m barely specced into endurance. 
---
I got a physical copy but my friend got the tricen. Digital for me.
---
Is this an unyielding build to?  Do you keep 80% Rads to keep your health low to maximize that perk that lets you do more damage the lower your health?
---
Teaginthedragon is my user, I sent you a friend request. I have to make dinner, but when I get back on in a bit I'll check to make sure I typed it correctly. 
---
Yeah the was alot but I was like second person to get to her never happened before. 
---
Lvl 30 here, i never use chems either! I really enjoy discovering things in this game on my own. 
---
if games weren't meant to be played like this then nobody would have invented the rumble feature
---
Somewhere around 1000 is fair, that's what I'm listing mine for. 
---
I livestream Fallout 76 on YouTube and for those of us who are supportive of the game and where it could lead, we have to deal with trolls in chat and comments basically telling us we're wrong and we're not playing it right because I'm not duping or spamming server hops to get vendor loot to change. Which is not fun to watch. I'd rather explore, craft, quest, and mess around with my friends and viewers than have to make sure my mods are on top of the trolls. 
---
This story warms my heart. I remember when Fallout had me by the heart and wouldn't let go. I'm an admitted casual fanboy. I like the world and the stories, and 76 is just giving me the selfish opportunity to play with others to share my general childish glee every time I get to mow down a scorchbeast or craft that new prime receiver. Much love.
---
I’m on PS4 not even the pro my game has never crashed 
---
Ha-HAH! Venezuela. Wait, they *are* western! lol
---
I didn’t think you could trade x-01 P.A. it gives me a message about it being destroyer if I drop. Maybe the trade window works.
---
There is no right way to play a game, but to simply enjoy and have fun playing it. Seems you are having a muck of toxic relationships.
---
Nah, we clearly misunderstood, I never said I can take 5 times the loot out of one enemy, I only said i take 2 times the loot out of one enemy and I precisely described how (easy, loot it twice with two different accounts :D).
---
What I also said is that playing the way I play, I can have 5 times the amount of legendary enemies to kill, than compared to any other methods, because its just the approximated ratio of how much I wait vs how much you should be waiting. This is not bullshit, this is not debatable, this is just how the things are. I have my golf club fresh and fully respawned every three-to-four minutes. All them legendary ghouls, the wendigo/glowing, around forty ghouls total. It takes me around fifteen minutes to get 200-300 lbs of legendary gear I then have to utilise.
---
Nope. I checked the workbench the atomic shop every 30 minutes and so on. Nothing showing up but the normal stuff thats in the atomic shop.
---
No gun camos or fallout uncle sam outfit or salute emote.
---
Well when you waste time fighting the end boss its supposed to drop something. 
---
Weird I use xbox one x (not trying to start anything sorry in advance) and have normally 0 issues mabeh a crash if I try to pull some stupid shit but idk my friends hate me for buying an xbox and then complain so much about crashes 
---
He might have possibly gotten an email from Bethesda with a code for the items could check with him?
---
Well just cause people is selling Serums at a low cost doesn’t mean they are duped. You can the recipes from The Scorch Beast Queen. You can also get perks that give you double what you craft.
---
See, this is exactly what mob mentality is: accusing someone else without even understanding what a mule’s function is and insulting another player for simply playing the game. Why are you blaming this dude for hoarding loot when there has never been a limit of how much junk/ items you can carry on your character? How stupid are you to tell someone who isn’t even breaking the rules that they are probably cheating simply because they hoard stuff on a character that’s inactive 99% of the time.
---
There were 3 250+ Level players on a server I played on last night. If you farm Whitesprings consistently along nuke zones by server hopping, you can hit Level 200 easily (you do need an Explosive weapon). It’s just mind-numbingly boring. I couldn’t make it past 88 because there’s no end-game.
---
Honestly, I don’t know what’s worse: the players who are stupid enough to think that miles or characters that have 100,000s of one item are causing sever instability (if that was the case, these people wouldn’t even be able to log on; think for one fucking minute) or the people duping to give people like yourself an excuse to blame others instead of Bethesda?
---
If you dont have it yet, I can craft you officer Knight and initiate outfits
---
Calling them bullies is a bit of a stretch 
---
It's not just Harper's Ferry.  I'm pretty sure most or all the vendors have their plan selection messed up that way.  E.g., I never see anything except the Radium Rifle plans at the Brotherhood vendor.
---
No he didnt, it was a dlc pack for the items. Hes check his emails and i have too just in case
---
Exactly it's a bug one of the most annoying.
---
I dunno maybe Bethesda should fix this
---
I don't have Internet at the moment so I can't play for the foreseeable future (broke af and need to pay Comcast xD)... but as soon as I get back on I would love to play with other ps4 ladies so feel free to add me too ^.^ same as reddit name: kyoshiana
---
Yeah. That's not hard when you keep server hopping with a separate account. You specifically said something about how you get five times the "legal amount" I still want proof that luck plays any part of it. 
---
*Every ps4 user 
---
This is a terrible idea... what really needs to be done is screen shake while you're within 50 meters of a scorch beast to represent the fear you should possess! secondly they need to drop their quano during fights that auto track any players nearby and slow their movement by 75%, this sneaky runnin around crap has got to stop .. you bow before a god!
---
How do I get the Enclave flair?
---
Yeah that's even worse 
---
I store some of the common ammo (.45, shotgun shells, 5mm) temporarily to sell to other players in bulk (2000 round increments). 
---
Farming Whitesprings (especially a nuked Whitesprings) is 1,000,000 times more efficient. 
---
I use X01 with emergency protocols.
---
Yes, I run around 80% rads.
---
Agreed.  Its basically an MP5/10 and they have suppressors for those.
---
My best guess is that Bethesda is trying to avoid publicly acknowledging duping until After they've fixed it, because if anyone doesn't already know about it, they would if Bethesda themselves acknowledged it.
---
Kind of a moot point now that it's common knowledge but I'd be willing to bet that's why their public response has been so lackluster. 
---
Hmm, only thing I can think of of is that since you were gifted it digitally it doesn't recognize it as being entitled to the items.
---
Same. I'm around people all day. I just want to come home and chill. It's clear the youtuber's need attention, but they shouldn't speak for everyone.
---
He really likes guns
---
[Yep, totally a thing. From Bloomberg even!](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/desperate-venezuelans-turn-to-video-games-to-survive)
---
Maximal irony: these conditions are causing in-game currency to become worth more than their *real* currency. War Robots and Metal Slug Attack are full of these guys. The Japanese players sometimes feel bad for them and give them pity wins, lol
---
Join us
---
That's how I play. I like to make sure I do everything and see everything before I do a story quest. I know that if I rush the story I will lose immediate interest in the game.
---
when your foundation is a single player game engine...
---
I have the shotgun I just want the plan so I can make the shells for it 
---
No, but I have a room for sitting around and getting high off chems in.
---
Multiple dupe methods means, to me, that this isn’t a normal bug but an issue with the core coding. That isn’t usually fast or easy flr devs to fix in my experience.
---
And it hasn’t helped with the holidays in the middle of the launch period.
---
My hope is that the next patch is soon and that it fixes the glitch or at least makes it much more difficult while somehow punishing blatant dupers.
---
I know people advocate for increasing the level cap for weapons.  ut that screws over everyone who has been playing honestly when the game isn’t even three months old.
---
I’m off but remind tmrw pls
---
1 more level and you'll be a boss
---
Did you turn special effects slider to zero? 
---
I'm level 340 with 515 hours played totally solo. The game is fun.
---
Highest i've ever seen is 525. That was like 3 weeks ago. 
---
Has happened to me once with SBQ and about 2-3 times with 3 star legendary ghouls... It's only been happening as of really recently for me, how long has it been happening to you?
---
It's completely possible to kill someone in a matter of seconds with a TSE shotgun or Melee weapon even through slap. 
---
I'm 161, play casually, and use no xp buffs, perks, or grind levels. So it could be. 
---
That's not THAT bad. I'm running with a mix of t60 and t 51b right now, with only a super sledge and a 50 cal. At level 64. What really matters is your perks.
---
I haven't tryed 74 yet. But I started playing Fallout New Vegas and played 4 as well... I'm like you i take it slow and easy. I love to explore and create my own game experience... why should i try and enjoy somebody else's experience by playing their way... doesn't make sense to me. 
---
I also enjoy the FarCry series. For the same reason. I get to create my own game experience...
---
My kids and their friends like to watch, cause I play it different then them they get a kick out of it... they do mock me that I can play a game literally for months. But it's all in fun. Dont let someone else ruin your game. Because it is your game experience. not theirs if they dont like the way you play screw  them... be your own person. That's the joy of open world. 
---
Like I said. I haven't hit FO 76 yet. And I haven't tackled a scorchbeast. But based on my experience with other fallout games if you took out a level 40, and your level 34... that's an impressive feat. Good on ya.
---
Is FO76 worth it. I love Fall out but I have heard do many mixed opinions I am a little nervous. I dont want to be disappointed...
---
ooo sick burn...I'm the one upvoting you, btw.  Because the more you type, the more my original comment is validated.  And you can't help yourself...look, you're about to reply to this and embarrass yourself even further.
---
We are doing alpha site now
---
Awe, I crafted myself 8 thousand 5.56 and 10mm with ammosmith and super duper. It's not all that difficult if you mine lucky hole once per day for 3 days, and if you have scrapper it's easy enough to come up with the steel too. On top of that with bandolier 10k 5.56 rounds weighs 10 lbs. That's the kind of thing you do to play a commando.
---
Also boards are the tool they use to start duping.
---
Nah, the issue is the fact that it's a weapon so the server has to keep track of every single ones durability and mods.
---
yellowtailtemaki inv
---
thanks babe you want my paetron link?
---
im level 340 with over 500 hours played. Im essentially on disability making full time wages. I could be a lot higher if i grouped up. 
---
Join me 
---
Uninstall this sad excuse for Fallout. You could try that!
---
Nope.  I checked the "Audio" settings and everything is up at least halfway.  I can hear rushing water and stuff in the background.  When I click play on a holo tape the background noise mutes itself but I don't hear the holo tape.
---
Yeah a lot of it is snapping issues and it's sad we're probably going to have to wait on a mod to fix it versus Bethesda. Just kind of irritated about it.
---
That’s not how this works
---
Some men just like to watch the butter churn.
---
Wrong subreddit 
---
Level? Specs? Pics?
---
Honestly this is one of the biggest things that bug me about people, youre entitled to your opinion, but don't you dare try to tell me it's shit if you haven't played it.
---
I mentioned it offhand as something I got for christmas and one of my friends are like "ew it's a shit game" and I mean come on, you haven't even fucking played the thing, and you play CoD so don't throw rocks in glass houses.
---
How are you gentlemen?
---
People should use vicinity chat more 
---
I just spent an hour playing with .BEAN after he sent me a team invitation. I was at level 23, but he helped my grind tremendously. We were taking out legendary behemoths, which I would have never even thought about. After jumping up a few levels I notice that he fast traveled back to his camp. I followed him back and as soon as I got there I remembered this post that I read yesterday and it clicked that it was the same guy. I mean, what are the chances? Not sure if he enjoyed me calling him Mr. Bean the whole time though...
---
My point was that there AREN’T only country girls in College Station. Many play video games, and have similar interests. And you said video games, not “video games that I actively play”.
---
Also....when you're in the PipBoy screen, change the view of the Pipboy. That helped me when I was still playing.
---
No because it’s not a woosh.
---
They've stated they don't Currently have the tools to do so, but the data is stored server side. They have access to it, it's entirely possible for them to build tools to do it given time, and they probably will now that they've been shown the necessity of it. This is their first attempt at something like this and they're clearly naive, they'll learn. 
---
Its far from fake and a too real of an issue since release.
---
But don't rush for a refund i gotta believe that they have something planned to deal with this soon. Just hopefully it can undo most of the damage done as well.
---
There is currently a bug where if you leave your PA on a workbench, someone can steal what's on it. So don't repair it if you have other players hanging around.
---
Level 45
---
Umm.....
---
Obviously you don't even watch 76 content....
---
You forgot to speculate wildly with absolutely zero evidence
---
Construction covers that.
---
Assassin Sentinel armor you can get up to 100% damage reduction, you cant be touched while standing still. Would work well with melee tele smash build. 
---
I tried that as well.  I tried playing the holo tapes with both PIP boy modes.
---
He accidentally shot me at close range shooting at ghouls with a TSE shotgun. And I had low health. I don’t use stims until I’m at 20-40%hp. 
---
cool provide video proof.
---
Yah?  I don’t really want to post in the Toxic...

Totes fair.

But then again felt nice just to not care for once :)

Normally a decent guy. Spmething about cat v mouse triggered

My perks are like my room. I need to come up with a build. Fast.

Oh shit I'm out of ideas then lol good luck

If on xbox I'm always willing to help out and if yall ever need anything hmu always looking for a way to help ppl constantly dropping stuff for lowbies and higher lvl people don't know how many marine wet suits and helmets I've crafted for people who don't have the plans for free :)

---
I'm actually excited for this one
---
Try wait a bit after you get the message. I got the same thing for a few days. I pressed play, screen went black, I restarted my ps4 and it worked. 
---
Congrats man 
---
I don't rush anything in BGS games either (or most games)
---
Ive seriously still to this day not beat the final main quest in NV Skyrim Fallout 4 or 76[I'm lv 107]... (Long story short I rushed and did the main quest in Oblivion as fast as I could and it completely ruined the entire game afterwards) ((longer story short-ish...at this point I had not beaten Morrowinds main quest because I just had lots of stupid shit going on for a stupid amount of time or I had lost my game/system I had to restart so I swore come monster or high water I was gonna beat Oblivion))  so I fully get ya So don't let anyone get you down 
---
It does NOT matter what people think or say about you (in any situation)
---
You keep doing you and enjoy whatever it is you do
---
Ones that do aren't gonna say anything since they still wanna be around *after* lol
---
Jesus christ. How many guns do you carry around and why in gods name would you carry so many? 
---
That would be completely different compared to literally every game in the franchise. Also, just get the right perks and it wont matter.
---
You cannot.
---
Weird flex, but okay
---
That would be pretty neat if you could. I managed to place some foundations well under water but could never remove them and ended up moving my camp.
---
You can do a VATS crit sneak rifleman. I just suggested sneak commando because you'll do more DPS than a gauss rifle against the late game. My personal normal MO is to go sniper.
---
You could minimize your perception investment and stack more strength for a better scavenger build.
---
Lol, what a coincidence.
---
Thanks, I don’t explore higher-level areas though due to my shortage of stims, so, I don’t know where many faction vendors are.
---
Just...no. Seriously. I game in all my free time and that’s just fucking nuts.
---
The dude probably glitches his ass off with the nade glitch or just doesn’t sleep.
---
You don’t even have to force close on Xbox. Just logging out while in power armor tops your core off. 
---
That is the main appeal of most bethesda games for me. They give you a massive world to explore, it's a shame not to.
---
They attempted to fix A method, not the core problem. It’s likley an issue with the core coding at this point.
---
Right punish people like me who junk hunt I have been over 1000 wait many times to lazy to go to my camp on the twin lakes area 
---
I know, me too.  I just figured folk here would be more open to it then some of the elitists I’ve encountered.  Before 76 my experience was that to “true fans” FO3 was shallow trash.
---
I don't play 76, but as someone who is naturally good at games, and my best friends are "shit" gamer. No matter how frustrated I get when we lose a match because them, I'd never discourage any of my friends from playing a game they enjoy. I have realized how much more I enjoy playing with friends losing game after game I'd they are having fun, than playing with randoms and winning.
---
If there's anything you two are ever looking for to be crafted or just want lmk always looking to help people don't know how many meds ammo marine wetsuits and helmets I've given away :) safe travels!
---
Idk, but I'd ask customer support. The atom store seems to the thing they can keep track of. I've seen other posts with other problema and the support handled it pretty well.
---
Probably used them to level. I think I got level 9-10 from boards and throwing knives, scrapping, repeating until I ran out of materials. 
---
I never get the plans whenever I do it. Matter of fact the patrol duty event never happens for me.
---
Your right I dont watch toxic youtuber videos 
---
Yeah you can have as much nuke keycards as you want
---
I find myself giving up and then last minute it snaps. I'm sitting here thinking I tried every single angle that exists and then suddenly it's green.....
---
Then suddenly goes red just as quick 
---
Legal amount: There is a clock which defines how fast ghouls respawn at Golf Club. What I do is reset this clock to 0sec. This means that if there should be 40 ghouls spawned there per X of time, I get more to 200-300 in a given time period.
---
Notice: I tend to remain on single server for the whole sitting, I rarely server hop
---
Regarding luck: This is a separate topic. I can't tell you exact numbers, but I am pretty sure I farm more than fifty legendary items hourly on my main character. I also get access to around 1/6-1/10 of that kills with my alt character. You are free to explain how come my alt, which is now level 22, already dropped more quality items than my level 160+ main that is doing all the killing, but I will remain trustful to the mathematics that I have seen calculated by other players. I am not the author of the hypothesis that the RNG is seeded, I am just a person who read the related paper. 
---
Final notice: I don't do verbal farts. I can prove my words. If you are willing to take a look on how my farming methods work, and then discuss actual math, and not who is cool and who is not, then I am still open for that.
---
Had one before camps were safe. Need a new one.

What kind of idiot dates a girl who games and makes her feel bad for gaming? Fuck those dudes. I hope they end up with a girlfriend that never lets them play games.

---
Okay so I'm in a nuke zone fighting the queen with two deathclaws attacking me and this happened today. Was the first time I ever switched to the third person view. I kicked so much ass. It was so much easier to see while the battle was going on. I fought like that til I was safe enough to try switch back to first and when I did it was back to normal. Hope this helps.

You can play how you want, but... you don't need that much junk, haha

29 and I get that’s kinda a low level considering most of the other players I see
---
Did you put in the right code for the silo you are in? 
---
I finally found Modern Tables, and you were right on!  Thanks.
---
I feel like a very simple script could find and wipe out most of these accounts.  You have over 1k bobbleheads, yeah about that, enjoy your ban.  My assumption and hope is they are building up for a huge ban wave after they have the dupes fixed.
---
Don’t freak out over weapons yet.  The best weapons in the game you can’t use until level 50 anyways and some of the plans correspond to that too. 
---
Idk. In a way, yes. But at the same time I really like scavenging for junk. 
---
"oh no someones opinion better say they got it from someone else"
---
Oh well here I go grinding again.

I witnessed a maybe 10 year old kid absolutely hustle a grown man. I stumbled upon this interaction mid way through, near Watoga station.
---
When I got there, it seemed like they were agreeing on junk to duel over? The kid was going on about 100 screws and were they important? And the adult was pushing that they weren't.....
---
The kid seemed to not know how PVP worked and was asking a bunch of weird question like "if you kill me is my character dead forever"  and "it doesn't mean I'll lose all my caps right?"
---
Then the fight started and this kid started shooting a pistol at this guy while jumping backwards.... and when the guy closed the distance he switched to a rocketsledge or something and murdered the guy. 
---
radical
---
ArhenDante
---
Nah 401 is definitely doable. I saw a level 988 the other day though. I'd put caps on that one not being legit.
---
Found another one. You'll need level 1 lockpicking to get it.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/hSGdKhd](https://imgur.com/a/hSGdKhd)
---
Yeah metas change tho. Plus this game doesn't really force top dps so I'm not worried about it I'll min max when or if it ever matters. The queen always dies.  But thanks for the suggestion
---
You don't need that much hate towards hoarders 
---
Take down the queen and you will get it 
---
My grandmother, back in the day, used to make these weird crochet critters wrapped around coffee cans, then leave em on the top of the tank on my toilets .. dunno why, but apparently word is spreading and your bear has yarn so be prepared.
---
Brings back memories of pretending I was a navy seal in Rust, dropping air drops to my under water base. they patched it lol
---
Have you played more than 8 minutes?
---
I can confirm that having starched genes does not prevent serums from giving you a mutation. Two of my mutations were from serums and I NEVER take starched genes off for fear of accidentally losing my mutations.
---
Rose and Grahm bring this game to life when they're around. And I like the fact that it feels so much more lively when they're here and that it's significantly less so when they're not. I think Bethesda accomplished their goal splendidly of making a world that seems barren and freshly dead. Like you just missed everyone by a bit. There's evidence and signs of life everywhere, but none of it remains. It's haunting and fun.
---
Did you put the code in for it?
---
Having unlimited carry weight is a stupid decision to begin with.  Over 2K weight you can’t move.  Over 3k weight you cannot craft or get any more items.
---
In my six years on reddit I have a total of 3 comments about Fatty Mcfat Fuck. 
---
How could you possibly reach your conclusion? Because of three ... now four comments relevant to a discussion about him?
---
Pack it up boys... sherlock here solved the case... I have a secret obsession Dim Durling.
---
Precisely my cognitive activity as well
---
Just start attacking them if it's that big of an issue 
---
Yah and there are times when the quest markers don’t show up so you don’t get credit for killing an enemy cause it’s not in the zone they specified 
---
Welp at least I somewhat know what I’m doing now, thanks.
---
if your game messes up big, you get a peek at the dev stash
---
Huh? Where's the hate in my post? I honeslty couldn't care less how you play the game. No need for so much hostilty fellow human. 
---
I don't have time for that. You are just leaving the server and coming back, you are not special. Stop wasting your breath. You definetly do verbal mess ups???? You are not some sanctified English teacher or lit major. You are a troll. You keep going in circles on what you say. I'm done here. 
---
They downvoted you because you have no clue what you were talking about 
---
Bullshit I build I make new gest for new players 
---
This is the most wholesome thing i have read about glitchy ass 76
---
Never feel shame you were just seeing if it was possible to climb it.
---
988!!? I can’t even imagine the grind for that!
---
Wish I could upvote you more for owning it!
---
Aw, please don’t be scared
---
That would require that they care.
---
Yeah thats another thing that has just irked me. Lining something up just enough and it's green for ages and then it wont snap. It's incredibly frustrating and sucks all the fun out of the game.
---
It's uhh... It's part of one of the Watoga quests. Worse than just having an elevator, it's a spot most players end up visiting.
---
Perplexing boast, but alas. 
---
My turrets always found a reason to hate and constantly fired on me until I deleted em cause I'm superior, it's best to not have turrets in this iteration.
---
We have no idea since they won't tell us fuck all of what they are doing.
---
There was not hostility though. Oof.
---
It's best played with females who scare easy
---
Oof 
---
That's fine, and I do that too. My base is right next to the overseer where I make their weapons of choice and mod it how they like. I have 10 of the small water purifiers and crops for them. There's no hostility in what I was saying and I'm sorry you took it like that. But bro, it was a joke, not a dick. Don't take it so hard. 
---
oops
---
What do you guys play on?
---
You can describe poor management how ever you want. But most online game that notices a game breaking bugs fixes it asap. And it is not the case for for this issue.
---
I'm not fond of automatic weapons so no :/ 
---
Lol that happened to me got 2 floors placed under and couldn’t get them out 
---
Well ya got me there. That subreddit is pretty damn toxic 
---
I mean, something is going to have to be done once all the dupe methods are fixed. Whether it's upping item level or what have you. Something to make people want to drop them and stop clogging the servers! But...I'm sure dupers would be salty and keep it all *just* to keep the servers unstable.
---
Can ya? It might be better. 
---
Listen fellow brotherhood member, telling someone they're hating another gives off as a hostile tone. 
---
1000 was just a ball park figure. It could definitely be higher than that. 
---
&gt; Fix something... Anything.. at the very least call out people publicly exploiting.
---
It's simple, really. Bethesda ***IS*** the VaultTek experiment..... They are merely trying to drive you to madness.
---
Yeah, like you go into 96 and get parts to a GEK that MODUS can repurpose. Boom. Figured it out, Bethesda!
---
Ight lemme fix my word choice
---
We have members on all three platforms :) 
---
Ahh alright, makes sense.
---
Oh really, I have no idea. I'll have to try placing it in a container to see if that works.
---
I take it it's a ts and not Tse? If it's the latter I could see 1.5k if it's just a regular ts I'm willing to bet 700-1k if you ask around or ask in game over the mic. Alot of people that play don't use reddit and don't realize what's going on around here. 
---
Lol. So many people bitch about the game when they’ve never played it. If they didn’t form their own opinion with *experience* where did they get it?
---
Don't know why people keep trying to come up with suggestions for Bethesda to fix duping.
---
Not like its a giant studio who would employ people who have experience in building online games or anything.
---
Quick question, whats a krispykremepie? I feel like there's an urbandictionary entry waiting to be made for this...
---
Yea we acknowledged that like I said I thought the guy was saying he was duping stuff I'm only lvl 19 idl what super duper perk is lol if you wanna downvote me for it that's your prerogative 
---
MY DOG FARTED LOOT BOXES CONFIRMED
---
I cannot wait to aid the American government in rebuilding West Virginia.
---
Is this on ps4 because i saw the exact same thing
---
Credibility confirmed.
---
Marsupial&gt;Stairs
---
What system. I can hook you up with some lvl 50 armor that boosts all stats by 3 when low on health except end and I have some decent weapons I can help you out with. 
---
Great job none the less. U have done something most people will never do. Dont feel bad
---
Already ran this exact build, same perks in str/agl/luck. Definitely can keep up with criticals
---
handmde rifle plans can be purchase starting at 15 from harpers ferry vendor and (watoga plaza?) there is a cap before it getd taken away.. otherwise you have to wait till patrol duty event spawns  at the prison north of morgantown...  or buy it from someone selling it starting at 1k caps if your lucky..if your on ps4 i can make on for you just need mats for it lol
---
No, you speculated wildly about what it was and came to a ridiculous conclusion. It’s lazy, dishonest, and not worth my time. 
---
They place on top of a foundation a take up 2 squares. You can build walls around them too.
---
Only foundations?
---
Tbh I didnt know my build until around level 25. I was using rifles and had most of my perks for them. I ended up slowly changing into a heavy weapon/melee build later on. At 50 you can start to move around your specials, which is when you really need to know your build. Builds are basically focusing on a specific style of gameplay. For me, I'm basically a tank. I run PA with a bunch of heavy weapon and two handed perks, along with some survivability perks (extra health, more rad resist, etc). I would try to figure out what type of gameplay you want to focus on and just build from there.
---
It definitely is situational and seems to have little relation to most factors. I was running the game very well with only a few crashes and disconnects for a good month after launch, and in the past few days I've had a ton of crashes. 
---
What would I need for materials
---
You clearly can not read what I am saying. The damage I was doing is vastly more than an accidental shot from a TSE. Theres a cap to damage that can be done, and its around 1-2% of health.
---
Nice thank you
---
i'll keep it in mind :)
---
I like how instead of someone just correcting me you feel the need to downvote which again is fine but it amuses me why the need to be so negative lol
---
ok kid i dont? maybe dont give pc people advice from your space heater
---
and I shall nuke....a golf course!   MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
They have been updating the engine, the morrowind iteration would been thanos disintegrated attempting to run Skyrim.
---
This is what happens when an engine has multiplayer shoved in (not easy when there was none) and its fundamental way of doing things (basing everything on what THE player is doing) and working its coding to operate independent. 
---
Then proceed to not allocate enough time to real world testing. The real question is was the entire company this arrogant or was it a few big wigs who got impatient?
---
9 actually but I’ve actually played a decent amount
---
&gt;Instead we got a financial stop-gap to help fund the development of their new foundational game engine. You are welcome, Elder Scrolls 6 players.
---
Uh...who wants to tell him?
---
Ok, I'll do it. 
---
They're using Gamebyro for TES 6 and Star...field? Bound? w/e their new IP is. 
---
This train ain't stopping boys. Maybe we'll hit 30 years on a single game engine. 
---
The snap on top of a foundation piece. Put down at least one floor and they should snap to it
---
Yep
---
Too bad a critical build is pointless for tse, because two shot prefix destroys accuracy in vats and explosion will kill before critical procs.
---
Fuck these dipshits.
---
Doesnt happened often to me on my 1 TB ps4
---
To be fair, I think it's quite the accomplishment for a potato to even display an image. Really well done. One large step for all potato kind. 
---
Why not use the Sentry Helmet?
---
Didn't eso have a bunch of issues early on? I never played but I vaguely recall some friends who played early on and them complaining about issues. 
---
Also, I am fairly certain that Bethesda needs no additional help financially if they wanted to build a new engine. 
---
Scorch beasts are simply not fun to fight in the least. Whenever I get spotted by one, it is generally a moment where I'm thinking to myself, "oh fuck not again, there goes my ammo and durability." My play session today had 2 scorch beasts spawn on my house on 2 separate occasions. I'm not even close to a fissure site...
---
Then there is the "yell spam" that they do, it is clearly a bug that just never got fixed. the fact that they rarely land like what the OP said. Make scorch beasts land way more often and fix the yellspam.
---
Bethesda pls.
---
They don’t keep coming though? You can argue that old bugs are still around (they obviously shouldn’t be) but let’s not pretend anything new has really gone wrong. I know some people have said the disconnects are worse but it’s just good and bad days imo. 
---
Regarding inventory, it 100% depends on what’s being carried.
---
Stackable crap doesn’t do much, it unique items like weapons and armor that cause databasing lag.
---
Nice to know at least one other person has enough sense to get how this works.
---
True; I finally moved my main CAMP recently and it doubled everything. I ended up deleting the extras so I could build new stuff
---
Outside harpers ferry on the small dam by the train cars awesome location.
---
Didnt even downvote lol
---
not really i typed a sentence and then stopped thinking about it.
---
What would heavy guns be?
---
Love this on a whole nother level. I dream of doing this with my dad but can't cause he had a stroke. This story filled that space. Weird. Never thought it'd be from Reddit though lol 
---
oh my god, why don't you idiot redditors learn what gaslighting means.
---
I'm not sure it should be a weight limit. Some people have alts they trade everything to via a friend, all their legendaries they may sell or use later. I think the better idea is a max count of all of object types. A weapon with the exact set of legendary traits or mods could be pruned at 2 max in any inventory. Unmodded weapons max out at 20. All junk types max at 1000. All ammo types max at 10000. All bobbleheads max at 3 of the same in your inventory. They would have to pick a reasonable number for everything and then prune down to those amounts.
---
Yes I’ve been doing this for quite a while and it’s never glitched 
---
Well let it be confirmed for the masses: with a railway rifle, patience and complete blissful ignorance, anything is possible!
---
for a lvl 25 9 screw, 9 spring&amp;5 gears theres more stuff but those are the only things id charge for cause im always low on them lol there is not 30 so next is 35 which is 7gear,11screws,12springs
---
otherwise go to berkely springs and look for nail salon far north of the town and there should be a handmade that sometimes spawns there 
---
I love these builds! they are insane even without a tse shotgun which i don’t use. If you are on the pc and at short range and target the head in vats you go on crazy long killing sprees. The event Distant Thunder in the bog is another good one that you can just run in and basically never leave vats killing dozens of scorched. It’s pretty funny. I prefer gunsmith to first aid so my weapon doesn’t break as fast but that’s more of a quality of life thing. 
---
Yah I’ve been doing it since beta
---
You are good that’s how it’s supposed to work.
---
Thanks, good to know. Was afraid I was doing it for nothing otherwise.
---
Well if I remember correctly ESO has a pretty strict banking system (been about a year), and the combat style of ESO doesn't really fit the fallout style since fallout. Now this is my personal opinion, but I like the way 76 was developed, minus the bugs, exploits, and servers. Every game goes through balance problems during the early life so I'm not to worried about that, but they really need to get a hold and neuter the exploits. 
---
And I'm just going to wait for a Raider PA paint, preferably one that looks permanently splattererd in blood.
---
Mailbox for our bases maybe
---
You're not shit at games. You're methodical, thorough and play at your own pace. Every approach is different, and the boys you dated are idiots for shaming your style. 
---
On the river south of deathclaw island.

It's a junk/water farm.

Me and the nearby island have a RP relationship. 
---
Everytime we see each other....one of us dies. 
---
Sometimes I win. Sometimes I don't. 
---
Eventually I'm sure we'll be great friends, our bond forged in the fires of rivalry. 
---
i'm not an incel. incels believe that women only care about looks and nothing else, and they believe that "chads" can treat women however they want, since women only care how hot the guy is. so incels don't think being "nice" to girls works anyway, you are either good looking or you aren't.
---
I think I got the stuff for thirty
---
"Re-skinned ESO" Please noooo, the biggest gripe about ESO at release was the fact it wasn't like a multiplayer Elder Scrolls game, it was an MMO based in Elder Scrolls. This is mostly an actual Fallout game, albeit pretty bare bones in regards to content
---
It doesn't. None of the perk cards affect it's damage. In FO4 it was a rifle. So if you wanted to drop your damage perks in place of other perks, the Railway Rifle is ideal. You could do a super scavenger build with it if you equipped bandolier so the ammo was weightless, have junk shield and just keep thousands of steel on you. I'd do this:

Add in some mutations like speed demon, and marsupial and you'd be looting for days.
---
yay enclave ftw
---
Not a valid excuse, though. 
---
“You like that game?!?”
---
Same thing just happened to me, but with the torso and right arm of my x-01 armor.
---
What a pain in the ass. Now I gotta collect at those gears to remake those pieces.
---
Great to hear this
---
:) 
---
I saw a lv. 454 on PS4 about a week ago. Very obviously used the exp glitch
---
I hope I can help add to this if someone hasn't already or you didn't already discover this but rad-x diluted doesn't nullify the mutation while in effect which means you can run whitesprings safe from rads while still Mario jumping around. On another note toxic water has given me most of my mutations as well as the glowing meat, not so much the irradiated mass or anything like that and eating raw Flux has never netted me any but I presume there is a small chance for it. 
---
Basically. You could always end your post like 3 sentences earlier every time but you gotta throw down a bunch of descriptors. I've never seen anyone keep going on about how jiggly a specific fat dude is ;D
---
Nearby Site Alpha, somewhat a popular place as I’m getting that “camp area’s been taken” pop-up more often than not. 
---
always on a junk pile or lead deposit.... but... It saddens me.. I wanna move it all the time but I can't pass up the 14 lead or random junk.
---
Would love to be able to mine my own camp. Maybe cost a shit load of explosives and a you could place a mine that eventually will "strike" a deposit
---
I didn't see it in your list, but there is a bug with the Happy Camper mutation. After I got it, I was no longer able to share perks. The game turns the sharing off, basically instantly after I leave the perk screen. Kind of screws the whole idea of "herding", IMO.
---
Not if the server saves their inventory in the crash. Somehow the receiver’s inventory is saved but the giver isn’t and thus reverts to their previous inventory.

nukacrypt is a trusted sorce by any chance did you enter the wrong code for site? 
---
I play this game with my father too.. I’m almost 40, he’s 65. We live in different states, this has been a great way to spend time together. The pace of the game is about right for the two of us as well.
---
If they can't fix the dupe then make max carry weight = double your limit.  Can't pick up anything to go over the limit any item going into your bag when you are at max weight is destroyed.  Regular players don't spend any considerable time carrying double their weight.  
---
I just offered piece of my time, which ain't exactly cheap, to make a personal presentation of those tricks in action, just so we would be on a same level, when discussing the output of drops the game gives you, so we could have an actual reality-based discussion from which anything productive could be derived.
---
You have chosen to ridicule that, because, obviously, you are always right and I am always wrong.
---
What can I say, your choice. Have a nice day.
---
It’s super troll garbage by BGS. The best.
---
Ok... I don't understand... How does crashing the servers cause duping? The fucking servers crashed numerous times while in trade and I always loose shit... Lol
---
Don’t know about honestly most of your questions. Kinda annoying feature but I can’t see your post when commenting is there away around this other then copy, back out to read, go back to comment paste? Here’s what I recall 
---
Pocketed glitch: never knew about, probably patched but still super good
---
Soups: never knew they were that good. Nuka grapes are amazing 
---
Duping: still a thing but I’ve never experienced lag cuz of it. Or maybe I have and don’t know. I think if u stay out of their area it’s ok
---
Groups: really the only thing that keeps me playing. Most are fun, chill, and easy to be with 
---
Hope I helped. Enjoy fo76!
---
And don’t forget all the selfish players still doing it and ruining the experience for everyone else!
---
Honestly I'm level 97 and I'm not much better off. I have had normal weapons I modded myself, mediocre armor, and t-60. Roughly same as you. I got a 1-star legendary with a crappy mod today, but I use it so I cant accidentally scrap it. Your gear seems fine really. You can do better, but it takes lots of whitesprings nume runs (which I've only done one) to get much better.
---
After additional research it was the cloaking proc from my armor to blame.  Took it off, restarted the game, and fixed.
---
Thank you, I needed the laugh.
---
It will be region locked, I had the same issue on PS4 with a last of us game code and I had to create a new user with fake US info. (I am EU) 
---
I mean, what can they do at this point? Honest question. They dragged ass so long that TSE god rolls are selling for less than a 2k all over the place. 2k for the best guns in the game makes all other stuff virtually worthless. Not even worth the inventory space and time it takes to sell them. I have a level 35 2 shot plasma pistol i rolled that i literally cannot give away.
---
Where can u turn these in? And how do u get them?
---
Mayor for a day ..

It's random from a table. The Bomber Jacket is a semi-rare drop, but I think a clean version of it has been in the shop for atoms

Maybe free states themed to go with the preparedness theme though. They might get bitterr to those who weren't concerned before the bombs fell

Buildings a bust in this game. Try to build a ton of floor space or “upper floor” space and build it, then store others. Really just luck and chance.

I’ve found possible new evidence.  I need to see if it can be reproduced by anyone:

just southwest of Firebase Major in the red part of the map, just west of a fissure site so I can fix up the turrets at the Firebase and shoot down scorchbeasts

I killed one at lvl 10 anf it dropped literally nothing :(
---
Fallout games are literally replayable because of the variation in how you can play the game lmao. I'm on my 8th or 9th FONV run and it's my first time being just a machine gun rush dude.
---
It’s completely viable to put blame on the dupers as well. They actively choose to make the situation worse, instead of realizing the error in their ways and playing legitimately.
---
not a nother muhhhh gurrlfreeen boyyyyfreeen thread. this time its ex pathetic
---
Fuck, fuck. Fuckem.
---
You’re on the dedicated subreddit for it pal....
---
I like mailbox lol but lore wise ur ideas make more sense
---
Hell yeah brother. Let it be swift and merciless. These people have no regard for anyone but themselves. Drop the axe Bethesda
---
I would just love to look at this as: an unintentional screw up in code that was originally intended to be the levels the plans unlocked for sale at.  But meh
---
Onw of the most frustrating things is thinking I'm about to fire axe more than one ghoul and figuring out it doesnt work that way
---
I got it digital so it was already added and downloaded. And i did check to see if it was downloaded. Nothing showing up in the atomic shop or workbenches

Reminds me of le fusil terribles in FO4.  I could never get used to the recoil.

Right, if they can't find this stuff pretty easily, I don't know...

that's 1m of BULKED wood. 30m wood scrap

If you move the C.A.M.P. device around you change where you spawn when fast traveling to your CAMP.  Seems to be a little different for everyone, I spawn 50feet NW  of mine and my friend spawns about 3 feet south of his, but even when we move locations the fast travel spawn seems to be the same in relation to the CAMP device.  A fast travel mat would be nice but if you're spawning underwater or on the wrong side of a cliff moving the CAMP device should help.
---
To add to your list: when grouped up I'd love if the loading screens could be anyone in the groups pictures not just my own.  No idea how difficult this would be to implement on a technical level but it's something my friends and I have talked about since BETA.
---
Yes, it is indeed your fault for exploiting it. You can easily choose not to, and yet you do and make the experience even worse than it initially was.
---
I have two problems with two quests, first is the novice of mysteries quest, it will not let me through the secret door in the manor to use the fabricator, the second quest is early warnings, it is not marked on my map (not sure maybe it's not supposed to?) I play on PS4 pro and my  PSN is (regrettably) ProFortniteBuildr.
---
You don't need a second floor just a foundation... Do the stairs and floors first because once walls and other shit are placed it can make it impossible to place them.. But if you place the stairs and floors and the basic wall-less skeleton of a structure first then there's no problems. 
---
That's probably what's been throwing you off. 
---
While true, the players actively choose to worsen the experience for others. There is still blame on them as well.
---
Meh. 
---
I get it's frustrating. 
---
But this has been a thing in gaming since forever. 
---
Games crash at shitty times. I can think of many JRPGs where you have to battle through a series of boss fights with no saves between. 
---
Cart freezes on final boss. 45 minutes gone.
---
why not both haha robot mailmen 
---
Sucks man. Hope it works for you soon. 
---
Might be easier to just craft it.
---
True
---
I'm in my mid 40s. On both console and pc there are some great accessories that help with aging hands and joints. I use Playbudz and Kontrolfreeks on console controllers. They make the controllers easier and more comfortable to hold. On PC I use a gaming keyboard and mouse. The mouse is on the larger side with extra buttons. It again just reduces hand strain.
---
“He never accidentally dropped it”. This is a farce. This is impossible to prove. 
---
Sadly statistics say he probably accidentally dropped it at some point without realizing.
---
Not my video but if I am correct in which ones you are asking about, watch this video:
---
[Stackin' Stairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU7VpOhthMY)
---
You can craft the ammo with the tinker station
---
You could just look at anyone with 1000 pounds on them and make it easier. Would be pretty easy to see dupers vs a real account who just forever stays over encumbered. 
---
It’s a video game with PvP. Things like this are supposed to happen. Lighten up. 
---
Nuka grapes sound like a marketing sham. They glow, eat em.
---
And the pocketed was...useful. so you spammed equip/remove a pocketed armor piece. If you did it fast enough your capacity goes down. And if your carry limit goes negative...you effectively have infinite carrying capacity. One adventure, I have like 40+ hunting rifles. It was nice not making pointless round trips to benches.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
I'm confused. 
---
You posted a bunch of PG 13 pictures.
---
Honestly, it’s both. Bethesda neglects the game and people abuse it.
---
That's hott.
---
Good boy.  Now back to bed.
---
Again with the assumptions
---
Many did play it and many didn’t like it, myself included
---
You can do low lvl events to get a LOT of stims. As far as ammo goes, have you gotten around to grabing the super duper, and ammosmith perks? That can solve your ammo problem pretty easily. 
---
It’s almost as if people can still enjoy a game besides its flaws... you’re on the dedicated subreddit, you realize that right?
---
That’d be like if I stated the people who like it only got into fallout after fallout 4 was released
---
Your exes are scrubs. I guarantee it.
---
I have three sets I carry one on me n the other two in stash , hasn’t ducked up for me at all

Harpers ferry is where you can buy the plans, you might still be able to purchase them, but they are only sold till a certain level (haven't heard of many getting it from the vendor after level 25)

If it makes you feel better you weren't at the finale and probably would not have survived the rest.
---
Have mine in almost the same spot, but it’s across the road on the hill. Doesn’t seem to get destroyed nearly as much as it did closer to town. 
---
This and the dozens of bots that over spawn behind that counter in whitespring
---
They do treat 10000 items differently though, and people do that all the time. There’s also plenty other issues with duping. Playing legitimately helps with these issues, ya know.

Cleave? I'm not sure how getting an extra bonus attack after dropping an opponent below 0 hp is going to help. You can only use it once a round and you don't even get a five foot move in between....

I wish my fiancé would give any game a try and be bad at it, she outright doesn't like them, they tend to stress her out.

Honestly good on you for not giving up and playing the way YOU want to and at your own pace which is the whole point of the game, YOUR enjoyment.

You should be at least two years into your gaming career by 7.   I started around 4 with the NES :P

You couldn't give me visual proof for the one thing I asked. I've played casually since beta and I am lvl 106. Ive noticed there is no one way on loot, no perfect method. You made a post just to brag that you use two pcs to farm and to tell everyone that having luck effects legendary loot drop, you said I didn't pay attention to what you were saying before I jumped to any conclusions (so far not wrong), you told someone they do not have a decent attention span because they didn't want to spend 2-3 minutes reading your long post and analyzing what point you were trying to get across and then you proceed to act paumpus by saying that you never make grammatical errors and that your time is valuable when apparently it's not if the only thing you do is argue and play fo76. Stop farming whitesprings and play the game. I've found 4 out of my five explosive weapons and all of my decent armor pieces while not at the golf course. It's worth a shot. 
---
you're still fat and sad
---
pls notice me gamergurl i defended ur honor!!1
---
Lol yeah look at the state of this game man
---
In an MMO, if you crach/disconnect, it usually just acts like you logged out.  Why can't that be the case in this game?  The reason the dupe glitch is happening, to my understanding, is that players are forcing themselves to crash.  They put their items in a container and, when they crash and load back in, the game doesn't remember them putting the item in the container so it reappears in their inventory.
---
If it were like an MMO, the game would constantly remember everything.  If they crafted a bunch of boards and then threw an item in a container, they'd simply re-log in to find the same boards and no duplicated item.  I don't get why they tried to have a multiplayer game that used archaic single-player save mechanics.
---
Bethesda can, sure. However, other people have been known to either witch hunt or harass people without verified evidence. Also, people fall for false evidence all the time, even in regular life. That's why there's generally a sub-Reddit rule in place not to share anyone's info/usernames just to 'shame' them.
---
Imagine: if your username was doctored onto one of those images, then random people just kept sending you friend invites or harassing messages (if on console) non-stop either berating your for cheating or asking you for stuff for days/weeks on end. You didn't do anything wrong, but there's no way for a non-Bethesda person to know, but now you have to live with the consequences.
---
Grognaks Axe. 
---
That's awesome. I'm still a teenager, and I play this with my 45 dad and 10 brother. It's really brought us together. Before I played fallout 1, new Vegas, 3, far more hours in 4 than I'd like to admit. Now? They are going back to play the others, while ending each week off with family time on 76. Its awesome and I'm glad that you are having experiences like this with your son!

 Ot sure why this guy deleted that, but guarentee he could get in a lot of trouble if he was actual military of any sorts. 
---
I just got the mole miner gauntlet, its pretty wicked. 
---
Calling BGS morons, I’m sure they are gonna jump all the faster to help you with your issues. Good plan here.
---
It’s directed towards the dude who was duping and other dupers, not stupid whatsoever. They know who they are.
---
If you're on xbox I can hook you up with some lvl 50 BoS combat armour and a decent legendary wep. 
---
Blame both, because they choose to exploit it.
---
How do you have more than one on you? Anytime myself or my wife pick multiples up we still have one and can't get more until we turn it in.
---
I just want my big axe to swing and hit more than one ghoul in front of me. It should hit everything in an arc in front me me not just one monster.

OP didn’t dupe...?

This whole thread screams whiteknight

Pack did this ammo scam to me earlier. 1 round for 3k, he would drop the rest. Then he disconnected and dropped. Probably throwaway account, but reported to mods.
---
No need to keep collecting them before you are able to hand them in: you can only ever hand in one at a time, any additional ones you find will disappear from your inventory / merge with the one already there, with no additional bonus (like better chances for rarer loot).
---
Alright, let me jump in too! Lady gamer here, currently playing fo4 for the first time on PC. I am too a master of the shadows. I like to take in every detail, from teddy bears in bus driver hats or satanic looking paintings portraying sacrificial offerings. Lady gamers, unite! 
---
I know.

It was a terrible D&amp;D reference.

standard sledge because its so cheap to repair.
---
There is a little room about 1000 ft up at the Mono Rail yard. Hard to get to, but you spawn right in it when Fast Travel and I was able to put everything in it working except a power armor station because it's so small. Loved it. 
---
Happened to my friend. Don’t know how to fix yet. He just stopped playing ;( 
---
You think one of the things they would copy from 4 is dying from being too overweight, but no
---
And yet they decide to carry over Radrats without lowering their health, making them surprising bullet sponges
---
&gt;probably
---
It's right there in the side bar. No, it's not allowed. 
---
Uh. No. They don’t. They treat different items differently.
---
The number of steel you have in your inventory is treated as one item with a value attached to it to represent quantity.
---
If they did it any other way, they’re backend database for managing inventory would treat every single round of ammo as a unique entity to be tracked. That’d be ludicrous.
---
The issues with duping are just the method by which it’s done. That’s it as far as I’m concerned. It glitches the server, which really needs to be patched out.
---
The economy was always broken and so was the PvP. And since the game isn’t competitive anyway, why does it matter what someone else has?
---
*blink* 
---
Playing helps with what now? 
---
I play the game so I don’t get what you’re getting at.
---
Push them down and force them into that fucking clown costume,  this method also works with cats. 
---
It's the reddit way.
---
That's my favorite place. 
---
Also.if you run from the Overseers camp thru Flatwoods and to the vault tec agricultural center there are I believe 11 containers you can hit up. 
---
The only good Duper is a receiver for Miami on Tecmo Bowl. All these other shits need to be banned yesterday
---
Possibly, would be fun to see
---
Same. Thanks though for trying to help. Its the thought that matters.
---
It baffles me that they haven't fixed duping yet considering the fact people are making real money from it. Seems like something they would want to shut down ASAP. 
---
That’s the one
---
Thanks. I need to head up there any way.

What exactly is "broken"??
---
I loved me some NV. 
---
But it was the only FO game I ever traded in after the stupid disappearing companions in the casino bug. 
---
I bought it again later but took the trade in loss 3 days after launch cause of that bug.
---
No, it's a random result each time regardless of number turned in at once. You got lucky, congratulations!
---

---
Some of the teddy scenes in this game are creepy
---
It's one hell of a bitch for sure. I've been right there with you with the game crashing at integral parts of the game. Once the game crashed after I died during a nuke event. It had been glitching (for some reason it ALWAYS glitches up when I'm using a minigun or other automatic rapid fire type gun) and I died, losing my shit ton of scrap. Usually not a big deal but right after I respawned and got back into it, the game shat me out. So I had used all these resources, taken damage to my armor and weapons, had not had a chance to pick my scrap back up, and this bitch ass game kicks me off.
---
I understand rage quitting for a day or two, man. It's a fantastic, addictive game but man it is only a couple rings over beta and sometimes can't handle a lot of action. Action it generates itself. Hopefully someday it will have more capacity but as it is, it's a thing we gotta deal with for now. The crashes have gotten so much better (fewer and far between) in the months I've owned the game. If you see the point, stick with it. I'm not gonna press you to play but it's a good game at its core. I really believe it will get better as the updates come.
---
Also congrats on attempting launching a nuke. I've Never made it that far. I'm just one of those stragglers that show up and get xp and "help" take the bitch down. I'm glad you made it that far. It takes some effort
---
only broken bit i see is pic 1, no hand.  
---
care to elaborate?
---
Happened to me. I jist said forget it and started doing non daily challenges 
---
*cursory glance as thumbnailed image*
---
I wonder how bad it i-
---
*actually seeing the number of bobbleheads*
---
It’s time to stop playing.
---
What I meant, actually. 10000 unique unstackable items.
---
I’m aware.
---
Mhm.
---
The issue with duping is duping itself. It ruins the economy and most aspects of gameplay.
---
Not to this extent by a long shot. Many people don’t want literal gods walking around with stashes of everything to crush you. It’s an unfair advantage, cheating as it would be in any other game.
---
Playing without duping and all that helps improve all issues caused by duping. Less duper’s, less rampant of an issue.
---
Alright, I tried for about 7-8 hours attempting this in every way possible. As far as any of my testing has gone across PC/Xbox there is no way to do this. I tried everything. I did get the trade window to come up without the other player seeing it. Usually resulted in a crash for me. I tried many different methods, some of them making no sense. As far as I can tell there is no way to do this. Going as far as trying it while the server was crashing.
---
For those who will call me out being scummy trying to see if it's even possible. I was doing it with a friend and I would never tell anyone how it works if I was able to do it. I would of just quietly reported it and left it alone.
---
For how important these bags suddenly became they should have called it the "Canvas bag you didn't care that much about before but now that it's nylon it was the whole reason you ordered this edition" edition.
---
He's referring to the fact that a lot of the posts on here are deeply uninteresting stories with the basic premise of "I done seen a duper and I went up and took their stuff and then left ha ha suck it dupers". The stories are almost as annoying as the bastards who are duplicating. 
---
That sounds loke the anti thesis of creatomg content out of sanctioned purging of dupers. Maybe I don't understand what you're trying to say or vice versa.
---
I unlocked a mod for a pipe rifle the other day and I bet you I’ve scrapped a few hundred by now. RNG I guess 
---
&gt; Chances are media will pick this up
---
Almost every headline about the game in the media has been about the game supposedly being a mess full of bugs, not sure why they'd care about yet another game-breaking bug, or why Bethesda would care if they talked about it.
---
You are right, it isn't technically cheating. 
---
But Bethesda clearly didn't intend it, and if it is affecting servers in anyway then the player inventory should be capped at 1K max, and any further inventory increases should be done to the stache only, as is intended.
---
These are some really cool places, and most I didn't know about. Thanks for sharing!
---
My curiosity got the better of me and I checked out the blue billboard mystery location. [Pic for those who can't be arsed.](https://i.imgur.com/VnlsTEQ.png) &gt;!There were 4 cats when I stopped by, a functional radio, and some nice spawns (gun, ammo, outfit, meds, water, some junk)!&lt;
---
Maybe since power cores aren't a standard extractor it shows capacity instead of number of spots?
---
Very true
---
I think it’s tied to the output of the extractors. If you look at grafton steel workshop it says it has 4 steel extractors but actually has two but they are double the output or Normal extractors. So basically it’s not how many it’s how much they can extract. It’s weird for core generators cause they have been nerfed. So no matter what they used to do they make about 1 core an hour now. 
---
This has happened a few times to me. Hopping out and then back in always fixed it. 
---
You can only carry one at a time because they dont stack (if you up 2 or more at a time you still only have 1).
---
But you can keep turning them in though. Find technical data, turn it in, go find more technical data and do it again.
---
The only plans I've not been able to get are handmade and neon signs.
---
I can't be bothered with setting up new characters and dealing with bullshit though because the amount of effort has very little reward.
---
I always like to cleanse myself after a post this bad [listening to Rita complain about terrible tortoise players](https://youtu.be/2CZyqO1AJdI?t=5m33s) in that heeeelarious accent of hers. "You bring shame to my kind! Dahz not how you Turtwahz!"
---
Need moar Ritas, less thinskinned crybabies!
---
There's official modding tools for Fallout 4, shouldn't be too much different, bethesda also got a guide to using them.
---
Lol, love the French translation...as it should be
---
That is exactly what I just said...
---
Do you have any spare of the mask? It looks super cool and id love to have one. Otherwise do you know who you got it from?
---
I just checked and I was able to drop it and also place it into a container, no message about being destroyed.
---
My barehands. 
---
I just made a new character, Fisty McFisterson.
---
She runs around in her underwear and fists everything to death.
---
They credited my Xbox account after already responding and closing a ticket about me moving to PC. So getting the 500 atoms has been a pain. I just gave up. 
---
Yea i was gonna edit it but you had already commented
---
I do use the Sentry Helmet, but I'd much prefer a perpetually closed Assaultron Helm as I like it's aesthetic more.
---
A competent developer would have removed a gamebreaking bug. 
---
How does it feel to defend the person picking your pocket? 
---
Did you use a gun that uses fusion cores as ammo (like Gatling laser)?
---
You have said it all, good job in your findings 🙂
---
I noticed when I was farming for mutations, I would get mutated when I had 80-95% rads, don't think I got mutated before that.
---
Content creators were and still are riding the hate train to farm views, so take their "opinions" with a grain of salt. 
---
I love 76. It's got it's issues but I've much enjoyed it for it's exploration and roleplay possibilities. 
---
Depending on what you liked from prior FO games you may or may not enjoy it. 
---
If you're big on dialogue and the "impact" based on choices maybe not. 
---
Exploration? Then yeah maybe. 
---
A near identical experience as other fallout games? Probably not. 
---
&gt; but I love it
---
That's all that matters. Follow your joy.
---
If you walk up to the dots, does it not tell you the locations? It does when I do if I remember correctly
---
And they aren’t competent devs. That doesn’t give everyone the green light to ruin the fun for everyone else. That is their own malicious choice.
---
Good, because I never bought the game. I’ve only ever played off a friend’s copy. Let those who bought it enjoy it, there’s no reason for you or anyone else to ruin it.
---
It’s really not that simple. 
---
Select few of us simply don’t want to watch the same article get re-posted 9 million fucking times in a row so we can see our feeds constantly flooded. 
---
Some of us want to read content about Fallout and not the same fucking crybaby snot rag story every other asshole already posted. 
---
It’s like a flood of people went from hating on the game for being buggy and unstable and just transitioned over into the hype train about dupes. Some of you motherfuckers don’t know how to do anything but bitch and moan . 
---
&amp; Though I am being contrary to your one dimensional statement, I will say it did make me laugh, a lot. I am absolutely certain to an extent that you are correct about that. Lulz.
---
I mean let’s be real here: the sub has gotten very complacent and comfortable bootlicking for Bethesda already.  To say there is a significant defense force for them is not an understatement and there is no justification for it.  While people do need to be smart and make sure their ire is properly directed and not taking it out on the dev team or members of it NOT making the stupid decisions like atom shop prices, workshop production nerfs and more, because Bethesda has done an INFURIATINGLY Stellar job at keeping their heads in the sand it leaves us struggling to know who to blame and how to turn up the heat on them to get problems solved.  To say that Pete Hines, Todd Howard and the other executive staffers are using the team at their Austin studio as a shield against criticism and anger that should be coming their way I feel isn’t that unfair of an accusation.  If we could in fact inspire a revolt/coup de tate within the company and have some people fired from there that are responsible for the heinous practices and behavior plauguing the company over the past few years, I’d say let’s go for it.
---
But that’s not the reality we live in.  Instead we’re stuck with this half finished game.
---
Using VATS uses a TON of power. Same with power attacking with melee!
---
This was exactly my experience, the reviews are poisonous and they spread like cancer. I'm a huge FO4 fan and while this game doesn't live up to FO4 in my opinion, it has its own style of gaming which is supposed to be different due to its multiplayer nature and I can't stop playing it. Even when I don't, I tend to think about it and go through other ppls experiences on this sub. Highly addictive. 
---
Great name. Erotic and violent. 
---
Gotta educate the filthy casuals
---
Fusion Cores != Fusion Cells
---
Try r/fo76bazaar
---
Your anger is understandable but ultimately misguided.
---
Bethesda knew about duping during the BETA and has done fuck all about it.
---
It really seems like they have no idea what they're doing on the multiplayer side of things and the game is already ruined by the presence of TSE.
---
The entire "grind" for the game (even without duping) has been totally insane and on every server now you see low level people with full power armor sets farming at Whitesprings.
---
I get people want to play the random numbers lottery on any game, but FO76 was obviously never fully playtested or balance tested.
---
BTW all the things you mentioned for blocking customers don't work, even if Bethesda was doing something (which they aren't) none of those measures are effective. Every online game has cheaters but they usually at least have tools to *help* try and stop it happening.
---
Left hand missing in 1st person. exposed flesh parts are using the hand textures giving them that weird look, and the left thigh is missing the black plug where the white circle cutout is.
---
From the context it seems like you can loot the plans from containers in the Toxic Vally. This makes sense since we know containers are a source for plans. This seems like designator putting them in the Toxic Valley loot pool. I’ll go loot around and see if a ranged weapon drops. Plans are rare so not sure if I will get confirmation. 
---
 "**I am not against the duplication of items, but is it really causing the lag everyone has been complaining about? It was kinda painful when I quit, with random disconnects leading to lost loot and time.** "
---
Yes, it does. You should be against duping as it ruins everything of a Multiplayer game. 
---
**" I assume everything to do with the whitespring area is still dangerous right? Getting one shot by high level ghouls was a bit enraging. "**
---
Only if it's been nuked recently or you see a high level around the area.
---
" **I read they eased up on the stash limit, but I won't lie. I was making use of the pocketed exploit mostly cause I genuinely couldn't be bothered. Dragging back oodles of guns for plans and junk for scrap really eased off on the overall tedium. Has that been patched?** "
---
 Yes, they have. Yes it was patched. You honestly don't need alot of junk. Springs/Gears/Adhesive are the ones you might want to hoard but even then you don't need a unholy amount of them.
---
New to me. Sounds like a glitch.
---
The filthy casuals that... enjoy the actual qualities of the game and ignore the flaws? It’s almost like they want to play the game. Oh wait...
---
Just so you know, r/fo76bazaar has people selling serums for I think just 500caps. Sadly I think they are duplicated, or maybe they can just craft them and it’s cheap to craft, but you can use this information however you’d like.
---
That’s exactly how my girl plays and I think it’s the cutest thing ever. Nothing wrong with that play style!
---
Actually, I think I accidentally hit the the high level players with my shotgun spray. But, I for sure know I never had a bounty when I was killed. In other times, when I’d die to a player while I have no bounty, I would keep losing caps. I think my game is glitched.
---
This is infuriating. You hace to be so low lvl and somehow get into that high lvl area...
---
thats kind of what i mean though, the problem shouldn't be hidden by telling people to not have mules and stuff like that, the problem should actually be solved by bethesda.
---
ESO had more issues than FO76 does at its release, but over time they kept fixing them and fixing them, and it'll work the same for 76. It's gonna get better, no problem. FO76 doesn't have too many problems, it has controversies. People confuse the two
---
There's sooooo many places that can have camps put over them it's ridiculous. If you put them all in one list it would be massive. 
---
It would be nothing like that because I didn’t generalize an entire group of people. 
---
Oh yeah my horrible self used vats a ton trying to make sure I hit that queen. Whoa. I didn't know that drained the core, only AP. I'll have to moderate VATS from now on
---
Toad's the worst Captain ever..
---
He's like 0 for 76539 on foiling kidnapping attempts on Peach.
---
It’s funny because I traded it to a friend in under 3 months because I got sick of the game breaking bugs.  Like you I picked it up after the patches.
---
76 has only been out for 3 months and is exponentially more complex.
---
It does create a viscious cycle of killing, but players with bounties can't seek revenge. The only way to seek revenge would be if you guys engaged in mutual pvp, or someone got slapped to death. With that being said you can just not seek revenge when you die, but to say that you have the opportunity to seek revenge and your opponent doesn't isn't fair. But then again, nothing about the PvP mechanic is fair, lol. 
---
Then why are you here? Move on with your life. 
---
My dad isn’t here anymore and I wish I could have this. Cherish it. 
---
What's your game?
---
“So many people” implying those that complain where of one issue
---
And yes it’s the same 
---
I’m sick of these duper’s making money off of breaking our game we got to notify eBay and other shopping sites that selling these duped items for real world money is against the terms of service they agreed too
---
People complaining about the economy are RPers who dont play in reality. If there were no dupers the game would still have no economy because there is no meaningful crafting, raids, or content that needs gear better than a golf club.
---
I can’t remember what level it was but I tamed on under the bridge south of Harper’s ferry west of the red rocket. Had to server jump a few times, but he’s been at my base as my pet all week. 
---
More than likely, the first person files are missing/broken.
---
The other pictures are issues with the skin and spec maps. The midriff skin is off rotation and the spec map looks to be causing issues with shadows.  The outfit is likely a direct port from fo4, but bethesda changed the spec and reflect map compression going into 76. More than likely, the outfit is suffering from poor conversion.
---
It’s sadly an easy fix for bethesda to do, so I don’t know why it’s taken so long to fix :/
---
Ah. Assumed otherwise. I’ve seen people actually suggest what I assumed you meant. It’s been a little mind boggling.
---
Eh. I guess? I’ve pretty much given up on any economic and competitive aspects of the game. I just don’t see it ever being a thing for fo76.
---
I mean, it’s mostly PvE, anyway, so I fail to see how it directly drastically impacts your (or my) experience most of the time.
---
Yeah, it sucks when some godlike guy comes stomping around for fights. But it’s not like I care if he has a million of everything otherwise. Combat griefing has been really rare here and the one time I was subject to it. I actually found it interesting enough that I treated it as a challenge.
---
I play the game solo. And most I’ve seen online talking about the MP are those amongst friends. So I just don’t see it as a big deal with some random wants to cheat his way into infinite caps or something.
---
Anyway, I can acknowledge people not liking unfair advantages, but it seems to me that the priority should be fixing actual bugs.
---
The OP makes it seem like the duped items themselves is a stability issue, but that’s just spreading false fires. The *method* should be where his ire should be focused if he cares about server stability.
---
Now I'm wondering if I could go as far as initiating and accepting friend requests and automating trades if players are logged in at the same time... I don't know what the exact limitations are of these mods, simulating clicks and key commands for example.
---
That's how I play too, and my SO likes watching me play AC Odyssey.
---
Also, you're awesome.  At some point, you'll find someone who knows it doesn't matter how you play games, as long as you enjoy playing.
---
No? I bounced between two super sledges. A minigun, and a..... Pistol? Some fun I got from a miss nanny that was in the water park after I completed her mission. It sets things on fire for 3 seconds after shooting them. Sorry for the poor explanation. But it definitely does not use a fusion core
---
The game is mostly just missing content now, it released with far too few quests. It's gonna get better with time. It's a "grow with it" sort of game, people treat it like this is all there will be
---
Agreed. 
---
The game gets alot of criticism based on Bethesda's non in game actions.....
---
I also feel like people can't separate a "bad game" and a "buggy game"
---
Buggy games are unacceptable, but sometimes buggy games are still good games, just buggy. 
---
yeah, the lag gets huge in some nuke zones and on some specific events (mostly around Morgantown for me). First week i couldn't play but those last couple weeks i could play normally.
---
i was mad on the first week
---
Yes, I do enjoy the game.  Are their issues? Yes. Is this my first rodeo? No, it is not. 
---
If you can get past all the bugs, wrecked economy and broken PvP... then you can start considering if the lack of any real NPCs (apart from mobs or robots) or any human dialogue is ok with you. Also, you can't text chat. You're forced to voice chat. Otherwise it really is a great game with a lot of potential.
---
Seeing when and where there are updates and it’s playable
---
I subscribed when it first came out, got the preorder several weeks later than literally everybody else
---
Had to ignore every bit of news and then didn’t like it
---
I’m waiting for a time when things get better because I don’t have the time to play a game hoping it gets better, but I also refuse to waste 200+ 
---
I guess it’s hope bethesda does something okay
---
the gatling laser uses cores
---
So at level 180 in theory I could tame a level 91 deathclaw?
---
I can understand if they don't want to let us personally fill shelves because of limitations in the game or whatever.... But I don't understand why the shelves all had to be blank... At least make the shelves we get come with decor built into them.... Same with all those tables. 
---
Plus I'd be a lot more inclined to buy atom tables or shelves if they had a ton of decorated ones to pick from... I'm not buying empty shelves tho when they are so useless lol
---
At 307 and I have easily gotten my money's worth.  Accomplished all my goals in the current game though so I spend most of my time logged in just roaming the map checking in on other players.  
---
Its not, thats anecdotal bullshit that ive tested a thousand times
---
Sure! you can add me! My acc is "Henri"
---
Its not true
---
Ahhh killing children. The one thing Bethesda wouldn't let us do... until now!
---
Dear lord.
---
I was one of those that canceled their preorder due to all the negative feedback from ytubers. I bought the game a few days ago and absolutely loving it. 
---

But... Why even dupe bobble heads?
---
Lol, maybe if we returned to old school fo turn based fallout it'd be useful
---
Yes! If you have the two perk cards in charisma. Wasteland whisperer and animal friend 
---
Hey man I’m not gonna feel bad for using an exploit. You can hop to new server 
---
That wasnt a dupe unless it was intentional. It was a glitch that spawned multiples of all camp items when a camp was moved. 
---
Stating that there are many people that do that. I don’t say they all did, or even that most of them. Why can’t you have a conversation without trying to spin it? Like for reals dude wtf. 
---
Indeed for me server stability was the only serious issue. The first week was unplayable in morgantown! Not sure exactly the cause. People said it was the dupers but i have my doubts. Anyway it seems waaaay better now so at least theres that. Enough for reaching 100hrs on the game.
---
Anything that uses AP drains cores faster
---
If it continuously circles the loot table it's lag loading, bet it hadn't even told you "event completed" and given you rewards. It usually loads after I die and run back, lol. It's because there's so many people there at once
---
That is a Awesome!! 63 and playing games with the kid is epic, great to see games are entertaining to all ages. Best post ever! +karma
---
Can you please tell me where you got the urban shielded plan from? The vendor always only has treated for me.

I found one at a vendor with faster swing speed and more dmg with each consecutive hit. Now that I modded it for three claws it’s pretty sweet.

It's probably a mod or something. As far as I know that paint job doesn't actually exist for this game, even via datamine. (Or maybe it does exist and we just haven't found it in the code yet. If somebody was able to find the Vim! Paint plans despite the Vim! Paint itself apparently not existing yet, it's possible there might be similarly rare plans for the Winterized paint)
---
You can just choose to not seek revenge on them, man
---
I'll agree that content creators on YT have a monetary reason why they'd want Fo76 to fail, but Bethesda's inability to go a week without fucking something up is the very reason why bashing on the game is so popular with the average gamer.
---
this subreddit is a hivemind, though. don't be surprised if you see people justifying the canvas bag, nuka rum and just about everything Bethesda messes up. or passive-aggressiveness every time someone points out how they're fed up with X bug- and there's *a lot* of those.
---
You tried to spin it as well
---
As well as trying to go off topic many times
---
People can and do have their own opinions, the 76 fanboys refuse to admit that and boil it down to “you didn’t play the game” or “you tubers” implying any and all negative views on the game aren’t “true”
---
Mate, I know exactly the feeling. Wishing I had someone to help and guide me when I started but under two weeks ago but I have helped two or three new people to good start myself now that I have grasped the game at least in some level.
---
This should be really easy to detect..  gee just dump an instant ban on anyone carrying over 100,000 of anything... :/
---
Truuuuuth
---
I am not against duplication for the same reason it never bothered me in borderlands. You don't have to partake in ill gotten spoils. Though if the lag is really that much of an issue I might wait then and hope it gets fixed.
---
Thanks for the heads up, but would you say whitesprings is a hotspot then?
---
And while those are universally useful, the weight restrictions were a pain when farming for plans.  I mean I could make do, but it's kinda annoying having a stash limit.  This isn't a deal breaker by any means, hopefully stash limit goes up
---
So your defense to exploiting the game that effects every area of the game. Is to tell people they can swap servers if they don't want to deal with the stability issues of you exploiting the game?....
---
You should really consider what you just said...
---
Part of me thinks that's pretty stupid since you can use VATS without wearing power armor but I accept it. I didn't even know this. I feel like there's some book I should get that everyone else  seems to have read becausehe time I am playing blind
---
I give it a big thumbs up!
---
ELI5: What are dupes?
---
Others still try to, and this furthers their struggle.
---
Again, unfair advantage, in pvp, pve, economy, etc. you get the idea. It’s literally not fair.
---
It’s fun until you continuously run into it all the
---
time, then it’s just annoying. And again, they’ll always have their items. Can’t just go back and try to beat em. They’ll always be ready.
---
I’ve seen plenty on MP, most just get rando killed for no reason and all that shit. The economy will be broken and give you a disadvantage, items and shops could see drastic inflation as the caps spread out, etc.
---
It’s clear Bethesda doesn’t give a shit, so OP and others (me I guess) are trying to appeal to those who do give a shit: the players themselves. Catch my drift here?
---
While true, I think OP’s purpose was painting
---
duper’s in red paint in general, not just the item count and all. That’s up to personal interpretation I guess.
---
Basically yes, assuming it weighed 2 to 3 times as much and had the same impact speed of the bullet, but realistically the Railway Rifle being steam powered means it's probably firing the spikes a LOT slower than bullets are fired, and the projectile probably weighs more than 3 times what a bullet does. At the same time, a crossbow bolt weighs more than 3 times what a bullet does, but you wouldn't expect it to do more damage than a bullet. So the railway spike is probably somewhere in between the two since it's not fired with a spring, nor is it fired with an explosive, on top of which the railway spike isn't going to break apart on impact like a bullet does, which does all sorts of horrible things to flesh.
---
You should seriously watch Mythbusters, they do stuff like testing penetrating power of arrows, bolts, bullets, pennies, ping pong balls, chickens, bones, ice, splinters, etc., it's amazing.
---
Its a really tough phase people go through on fallout... trust me, there is a light at the end of big bend tunnel...
---
I just got a piece like that.  It seems to make the mutation a joke: mutation requires that all armor be weightless, which is very fussy.  One piece of chameleon armor seems to provide all the benefits.  So my 4 other armor pieces can be anything I want: is that right?  Can you confirm?  The only requirement seems to be that I crouch, which frankly I do anyway....
---
and then i lose my bag permanently, with hundreds of screws, gears, springs, and all my shit that i can't fit in my stash 
---
Do you have all the proper perks to boost the weapons?
---
I ask because I sometimes forget to switch my loadout with different weapons. 
---
I like and enjoy the game; but it is a buggy pos that should have been left in the oven or launched as an EA title.

Multi-purpose axe. It weighs .4 and does great damage. 
---
You want to hear something much worse? Seeing a wanted player near your base. Fast traveling to your base and seeing your tamed mirelurk dead. Killing the wanted player because they obviously killed your mirelurk. Game places bounty on you for damaging their camp while killing them. The bounty system is a joke much like the PvP currently. Too many downsides and loopholes/weak punishments.
---
From what I understand of the methods there’s about them that could be unique to PC.
---
If you ever had the game running really great and then suddenly get messages that say “server has stopped responding, controls are temporarily disabled” then someone was duping in your game.
---
I read that it can't be a set spawn, it has to be a random encounter. So, say, that deathclaw at the substation north of watoga won't work. But, I could be wrong! This is info from around 2 months ago! If you found the one that occasionally spawns in whitespring that might work as if there are radscprpions I don't usually see a deathclaw. 
---
Isn't this only the exact way everyone plays Bethesda games? They mod the shit out of it and use console commands to spawn whatever they need. Trying to shoehorn that shit into an online game was the dumbest idea a AAA Dev has had in ages. Bethesda games on average are played by people playing with a big boobed anime avatar using god mode and a million insane mods. Expecting people to suddenly play by the vanilla rules of one of these games is naive at best. I'm not defending this behaviour I've seen games ruined by duping. 
---
I would say game flip. Someone out there would buy it for $5

I made most of my levels boost-free, just spamming events and getting into hell left right and center. One time I was with some mates in the Toxic Valley and one of them said he had some Mirelurks chasing him, me and the others were on a ridge opposite of him and went to take a look over and sure enough we saw him running . . . with 20 Mirelurks chasing after him, we stopped for a good 2 minutes laughing at him before we finally got involved and cleared up the rest of them.
---
He's not, it's copypasta, and he was probably was modded for not being civil.
---
I'm not on the xbox, and I dont know what level you are, but the Grafton vendor sells most of the shadowed plans. I dont know who sells the base plans for the armor itself, but often its the vendors at the train stations such as Grafton and etc. You could try the vendor yourself each time you play, just go check. When you buy any plans (under NOTES) and read them, make sure you write it down, since right now, there is no way to know if you already know the plan.
---
*fortunate son plays from a vertibird*
---
Oh right, I missed that part he said he was carrying multiples. Sorry, I thought you were asking how to do it, lol.
---
So PSA to everyone else, if you picked up 2 or 20 technical datas you are still only dropping off one so rather then collecting 14 of them you want to be collecting only one and doing it 14 times.
---
Harper's Ferry is a good source for all PA mods, apparently.  That and Watoga.
---
I totally forget where I found mine but it was just called "calibrated shocks," no power armor variant. I know that doesn't answer your question, but it's what to look out for! If I recall correctly it was on a vendor not a plan you pick up. 
---
Just Southeast of Morgantown. It's a good location for getting stuff of my level and its nice for farming the power armor that spawns in Morgantown train yard.
---
Great, another one of those I play fallout with my dad posts.
---
Where did you find your deathclaw and what level were you when you found it 
---
I’m putting my little one to bed but will check to see if I have any when I get back on. I may have a couple bulk. If so you can have it. Want a couple hundred gunpowder as well?
---
I can see where y’all are coming from. It does seem like it’s up to the community at this point.
---
On an optimistic note: I’m pretty sure the mass majority of those kinds of people are either currently moving on, have moved on, or soon will.
---
I mean, I can’t imagine this continuing to entertain them for long. 
---
Yes! One piece chameleon and all other whatever you choose and you're good!! 
---
It's either a blatant soulless cash grab or Bethesda are intentionally ruining any and all respect gamers had for them. Both are depressing. 
---
Level 30. Shoulda mentioned that lol. And yea I've been going around the whole map trying to find them
---
It's doable to have over 100k of certain Ammo types and Steel scrap completely legitimately by this point.
---
It's when the woman lets it crust, then you eat it. It can take a while, but it's said to be worth the wait. 
---
The nonsensical addition of the whole "once one member of the party initiates PvP the whole party is" is a disaster too, one guy comes in and damages your base get bounty you kill him, their teammate hiding in the distance who was trained on you the whole time now has free reign to kill you, like wtf?
---
Funny that you should complain about that while talking about your decedents.
---
Well you know it's a Bethesda made thing when there's something clipping
---
The game was released in a poor state, and I would go so far as to say that factoring in all the other non-technical problems too, the game was a bit of a disaster at launch. HOWEVER, this is really the first game I've TRULY LOVED that has come out this year. It checks all my boxes. There is a great game underneath the hood that keeps me interested, and if Bethesda can just get it under control, and if the game survives, it could be great in a year or so.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
TL;DR: Yes I'm having lots of fun!! Loving it!!
---
Yea I'm pretty sure it does and allows you to mark them on your map.  There are several of these in the world.
---
Social justice when it’s actually applicable lmao
---
Yep. People who get everything early in the game tend to move on to another game to break. Kinda like Castle Crashers after people found hacks for it. Not much content once you 100% a game.
---
The issue really is acceptance of duping, meaning more and more would give in to progress. It needs to be looked down upon and shamed, or it’ll spread like wildfire.
---
If you're having trouble with cores, log out while wearing your Power Armour.  When you log in, the core in the armour will be 100%.  Repeat for all cores you want to recharge.
---
The issue isn't that they're duping and flooding the market, the issue is with how duping is done. If duping DIDN'T involve crashing a server and affecting server stability the complaints wouldn't be as frequent.
---
Y'all messed it up the first time. We'll keep to ourselves over here. You do the same.
---
Request sent!
---
Man, I wouldn't say no to free shit, no matter how ill-gotten it was. 
---
I've been selling regular 2 shots, explosives, and swing speeds for around 1-2k caps for the past week, I like to think it helps bring the eBay demand down
---
Really? Dude. This thread is so full of good advice for my cores problem you all are amazing
---
Yes but the problem  would be finding a random deathclaw at that level that spawns by itself it certain areas.

---
Read what the game tells you. 
---
Usually it’s “find the plans for _____”.
---
Very doable. I imagine it’s actually also fix the duping glitch outright since Im guessing it works due to tricking the system into creating the *exact same* item by thinking it needs to instance one in. 
---
Having each weapon have a unique ID would solve that...probably.
---
Problem would be that they’d be facing the same problems they did when they increase the stash limit since they’re now increasing number of items to track on the back end.
---
The weight limit was meant to do that on the front end.
---
They’d probably prioritize just fixing the bug and increasing stash though. Easy PR. Visibly does something for players. 
---
I don't find it any more buggy or issue-laden than FO4 or Skyrim were when released.  
---
The issue is all the MMO gamers who're not happy with it.  It's not a MMO game that's Fallout, it's Fallout MMO.

I went through the trouble of launching a nuke at fissure site prime, a group of about 15-20 players took the Scorchbeast Queen to about 5% health after the Legendary *** health reset. It flew out-of-bounds and off the map completely, never to return. This was about 1 hour and 1000+ rounds of ammunition wasted. Sorely disappointed that I've sent so much time on this game (200+ hours) only to get this capping of a day of 5 game crashes or server disconnects.

Is this what wholesome feels like? Love it.

There are already tons of people duping and giving away god tier weapons and other rare things completely free of charge.  The game economy is long past ruined, I honestly dont know what they could ever do to fix it.  Yeah, they could release 4 or 5 star weps but the two shot explosive 3 star weps that are just everywhere now will still be good.  
---
They would need to scale like every monster up to 100+ and beef them up to the point where these guns start sucking  and then they would need to release higher damage tier guns, it's the only way this colossal mess up could be fixed.  That would require completely abolishing duping which I dont see happening for a while.
---
Tldr: game economy ruined, massively op guns everywhere now, and endgame still very shallow.  Will try again in 6 months 😀.
---
Most recent released is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21yeb4mmXFg 
---
What he's saying is that this game flopped so hard that Bethesda is going to give it the barest of support. How could they justify spending money on something that has no potential? He's right. The investment into this games future by Bethesda was directly tied to how many people bought it. They aren't a charity. Maybe just maybe they pull a rainbow six siege and pull in some people with a tremendous update. Sea of thieves is kinda having a comeback as well. Neither of those games were as much of a disaster as fallout 76 continues to be. 
---
Hi my name on PC is keazar. Im level 15. Would you mind crafting a workbench and decontamination chamber?
---
Yeah has to be a random spawn and also half your level. My problem is finding one half my level 
---
I doubt its me, ive stopped playing. 
---
Idk if you’re still making this costume. But I only just found out about it, and would totally pay 250 caps for it. Please and thank you!! If you’re not, that’s okay too!
---
I found a guy on XBL's LFG selling TSE shotguns for 400 caps. Bought 1. Not proud, but it's helped immensely considering how underpowered the non-legendary guns are.
---
I have tamed one at the whitesprings random encounter hotspot. 
---
Can you do Calibrated Shocks for the T51b?
---
If you do mayor for a day quest in watoga you get access to a safe that resets each time you server hop. 8 stims 
---
Today I was trading with someone for a legendary two shot explosive dragon and when I saw his inventory, he probably had nearly every weapon in the game with a two shot explosive legendary effect. It pissed me off because he had duplicates of all of them. He had over 50 explosive two shot shotguns!!!! He was giving me a hard time as well. After I was arguing with him about the fact he was a duper, but he denied it. He is on Xbox and his gamer tag is El jefe holmes 
---
I see, thank you.
---
What platform? I can just give you some if on PC

Naw, my game crashed and I ran back, gut about 2 minutes of shooting in and the event even completed for me. It sucked

[Here's](https://youtu.be/gr6p6L4Z17Q) a video a while back of me doing 333-&gt;334 in around an hour (without being in a party, without farming a nuked Whitespring and with only 5 INT). I'm 600 hours in at this point and still doing a level every hour or so even at 520.

My storage mule is also decently over 100k weight at this point, with multiple stacks of Junk/Ammo 10k+, multiple people on this thread would have me banned for it. :/

Can you do excavator calibrated shocks?

From me actually, I have 3 of them ready to install, on PC.

Was it during a nuke? Glowing and legendary ghouls often spawn in numbers like that during nuke events.

only X01, and T60
---

---
I pray for a massive banning
---
Unfortunately I’m on PS4 
---
I could, I have 3 of them.
---
No not a nuke zone while I was there 
---
I got like 60 pieces and I have no clue where from, probably events. Either way I only used it for the floor of my powerhouse
---
All good. I feel like the less of a problem duping/bugs become the more willing they will be with our stash limit. Waiting is never a bad option with a online game. As by then there might be more to do and more freedom to do the things you want.
---
Yes Whitesprings is a hotspot
---
I've seen people selling tse handmades for 2k caps. The value of those guns are already ruined. The only people they're making money off of are too lazy to grind up caps for a few days and check the trading reddits. :-P
---
They continue to spawn as glowing ones for 30-60 minutes after the nuke zone disappears
---
I debated gunsmith vs first aid - guns always seem to break a ton which is a bit frustrating but I wind up carrying 2 now. Of course I don’t have TSE which I guess would make Crit stuff pretty pointless from what I am reading. :/
---
If this would be done than dupers would be able to get rare guns they want to dupe for free, dupe em, and keep on their alts until exploit gets fixed and they will start raising in value again. As a short term solution it would work, don't know about longterm.
---
Anyone have their harvesters stop pulling?
---
Ok that makes sense it must’ve been bugged though cause we were all there for a solid three hours and it was never ending 
---
Is there something I'm missing or would the deathclaws on deathclaw island not work?
---
What happens if you put it in your stash?
---
Well color me surprised! I thought you were one of those people who say they make games but oddly never have anything to show, y'know? Glad to see that trope be proven wrong the first time I see it!
---
I like how he even have 254 boards, like you can see exactly how he duped by creating enough boards to crash the server. Lol what a pleb.
---
What jetpacks can you craft? I'll give you the materials
---
So just to clarify, do you put actual armour in the power armour chassis or just attaching the power armour pieces onto it?
---
It might sound like a silly question but you used to be able to store other things like mutiple fusion cores in a power armour chassis and then store it in you stash for 10lbs instead of the full weight of all of the cores (not sure if that still works).
---
The way it worked was yes you can put it in a store it but do not get into the power armour you are storing it in. If you get into the actual armour it wipes it all and you loose anything that isn't part of that power armour chassis (so 1 fusion core and all the power armour pieces will stay).
---
You need to activate the hand scanner on the wall next to the door. 
---
Trump said otherwise.
---
Death tambo.   Shake yer moneymaker.

I only have the X01 blueprint, it's not too special considering you can server hop for the mods

Beaver Dam next to the Drumlin Diner in Watoga. Just a little tent with all the crafting tables and a bedroll. Gonna put an instrument next to it with some crops and a purifier when I get time. Have everything then
---
Super sledges stagger them. Saw it today and couldnt believe it.
---
No, he's telling you that he slow walks to his **mules**, mules are alt characters used to store an unlimited amount of stuff. I unload onto my mule character multiple times per day.
---
My primary mule is over 100k weight, its taken me 600+ hours of hoarding to get to that point.
---
Roughly my thoughts on waiting. And I think the opposite on the first bit. If things were less restricted and it was easier to just mosey around and adventure with less worry about limits, you would have less reason to hit up a duper/dupe it yourself. Less reason to dupe due to the game itself being fun to experience
---
And damn. Cause i know I still have that quest. I have a train yard near there marked, but I remember getting ghouled before I could get the map marker for white springs itself
---
What about the Enclave is evil? We fight for America. 
---
While I wish Bethesda did ban duper’s they have already said publicly that they are not banning nor suspending players who are duping.
---
Someone actually sent proof to Bethesda of players duping and they said to ignore them. Haha if that isn’t the most backwards response if I have ever heard one.
---
Yea tse explosive weapons really should just get removed they are so wild of an outlier that they really can’t be balanced.
---
Irony is, if anyone gives you a set at that price it will be duped
---
How are high level players traveling with their low level friends akin to cheating on an exam? If anything, it seems like people sharing information on where PA suits are, where bobbleheads are, tactics on how to defeat the SBQ, etc. is more like cheating than traveling together to share XP. Are you also opposed to online guides and threads that reveal likely loot locations, as well?
---
I feel like they have the baked in revisit of the synths from fallout 4, I think that they could make lifelike NPCs with those. 
---
Just log out and in until they return.
---
Ya I know
---
Yeah, it can be really rough when you got Bloated legendaries smacking you around XD
---
Just craft them.
---
That’s probably what it is then. I just did a nuke on whitesprings and it ended, and we are still getting legendaries. Hope you got some good stuff :)
---
I'm confused, what happened? Did you drop instead of place your power armor?
---
I love reading the comments of those who are suffering from Fallout Stockholm syndrome. It's like ya'll know Bethesda does not give a SHIT about ya'lls love for the game, but yet we still have those who will defend the game til their death.  They got their money, so what do they care if you enjoy their game or not! I have hope that everyone will wake up and just stop supporting this trash! I don't know about ya'll, but if left something undone at my workplace, best believe my boss would be on me telling me I HAVE to come in and fix my mess. Seem's Bethesda doesn't have that same work ethic...
---
You on Xbox?
---
You remember where in white springs?
---
Eh, just upgrade your T51.  
---
If you can figure which one it is.  Amirite?
---
What does it take to make?
---
No that wouldn't work because that is a permanent spawn point.
---
A random encounter is a randomly generated occurrence that happens throughout the map. On the same spot on one server will get a bunch on mankins standing around, the next time you are there on a different sever your will get a random robot doing weird things, the next time you might get a super mutant camp and then then next one you might get a single spawned deathclaw etc.
---
Ps4!
---
I met my wife of nine years and counting because of a mutual love of games. Don’t settle for anyone who doesn’t treat you as a true coop partner in games or real life. They aren’t worth the time or the energy. Also, as a huge fallout fan (76 included), stealth is the best. Even at level 136 I’m still only half way through the missions. Good luck in all your wanderings! 
---
You're an idiot, no way around it, simple as that...... Ya feel me?
---
Hey man, I understand you're frustrated about the duping problem, we all are. The problem is that it is too hard for us to find irrefutable proof that someone is duping and could be too easily fabricated. Just imagine you claim a bounty off someone and it pisses them off. What is stopping them from fabricating a photo with your name surrounded by "sufficient proof". This type of trolling would keep people in fear of role playing how they want. 
---
I wish the solution was as easy as your post makes it but the truth is it's much too complicated for us players to deal with. Just give dupers waste land justice and inconvience them as much as possible. Stay strong fellow vault dweller our problems will be solved. 
---
I hope you don't actually think that devs and management should put their families and personal lives aside so you can pew pew without people selling exploited content.  You are aware that nothing in this game actually matters right?  Right?
---
Gotta break a few eggs to make a omelette

Don't drop your armour, place it. Placed armour is bound to you. Dropping it is what you do when you're discarding it

Oh. So it's got to be a random spawn. Cheers.

All that needs to be done is the developers add in a X in front of every item from a certain date. If the item/s in question don't have a X in front of them then don't trade for them. X, could be the start of a new version of the game, everyone suffers at first until we clear the game of all items duped or otherwise.
---
Dumb question, but why would that cause lag?  Until the objects are removed from his inventory and actually rendered in 3d space, the quantity value is just a single number.  If it wasn't meant to go that high, it'd overflow and drop to zero before it it that point.
---
Can anyone help me? If anyone has any low level weapons and extra ammo, that they don’t want, I need it. I logged on and all my ammo, weapons, junk and aid were completely gone. I had just restarted and go to level 10 then this happened.  Quackenbush74123 is my PSN if anyone is willing 
---
Ok so if I understood you. Server hop until I see an empty whitesprings area and hope it wasn't recently nuked. Is there a way to know if unsafe without playing tag with ghouls?
---
When you're selling, say it's clean (aka not duped), can probably sell for more
---
I will never be dropping any chassis again, that’s for sure 
---
I seen a guy selling TSE weapons for 400 caps each. Flooding this game with duped op weapons. How will Todd Austin address this?
---
Yeah but I just can’t find one that’s low enough level 
---
Now if only we could ban people who make up stories for karma.....you know...like you.

Exactly like in tf2, duped items caused by a scammer are worth much less than clean items

Stimpaks are great and all, but I prefer uaing healing salves. They weigh a bit, but hey healing is healing. I usually stash half if I can't carry them all.  Here's my quick guide:
---
Have chemist and green thumb perks, both are 1 star. Star at vault 76 and run towards the river to the east, all the while pocking up soot flower. Once you get to the river follow it down towards flatwoods and pick bloodleaf along the way. If you're eagle eyed, you should end up with around 50 of each. Collect water at the river and head into the church to make your 100 healing salves!
---
Haven't seen anyone justifying the canvas bag or nuka rum, just people saying those issues aren't with the game itself
---
Dunno why you thought a multiplayer game was meant to be played solo 
---
Yes, I did...for my sins. Lesson learned 
---
You shouldn’t drop anything you want, it becomes free game. You have to place power armor for it to remain yours.
---
I love the comment but dad jokes aren’t welcome here...😂
---
Ignore those chumps.  Do what you love, avoid people that talk to you like that in the future.  Don't let's those people in your lives as friends, let alone into intimate relationships.
---
Good luck OP.  Stay safe out there in Appalachia, and IRL. 
---
Power user perk lvl 3 doubles all fusion cores. Didn’t need the sprinting one anymore after I got it to the 3rd level, freed up a slot in strength. I have over 20 fusion cores regularly, even after nuke runs my supply rarely goes under 20. Pretty heavy vats user too.. so I’d suggest getting it if you live in your PA like me lol. 🤗
---
Fo shizzle.
---
If you call creating FEV and experimenting on your own citizens then yes.
---
What is the point of this post, honestly?
---
/r/lookatme
---
Lol, I *was* gonna post this but you beat me to it
---
A game that cant handle this is a meme anyways, I liked my time playing it but it's too much of a mess to play right now 
---
Well it's been silence for about eight weeks regarding exploits sooo gonna go with that. Don't think i have seen Pete or Todd speak about 76 since before BETA actually.
---
At least you are getting more from the game. I’m sure people power leveling aren’t reading anything. 
---
I've only seen dead potted plants - are those from teh ATOM shop?
---
Can you only launch from one silo per week?  I have been trying to find an answer to this. 
---
Technical documents should be stackable.
---
dude seriuosly what if they did it on a friend's account or like that and their friend would get banned not them
---
Not quite 3 months, and actually not even 2 months, if you exclude the BETA...which I do.
---
Start doing main quest lines.  You'll get rewards.  At level 50 you should be all over the Ash Pile and starting to move into Toxic Valley.
---
What why
---
I don’t use Chems either , don’t want to get addicted and have the negative effects 
---
Following me from posts? Seriously?
---
It happened wether you like it or not.
---
Last time I post anything mildly amusing.
---
You should pick better friends. 
---
I’m amused that this still happens, because this is what turned me away from the game two weeks after release. And it’s STILL happening. I made the correct choice, for my situation at least.
---
You personally can only do Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie once per week. I'm a little drunk and solo cleared Alpha, and I guess I already did it. Card is already inserted, just need someone to come enter code
---
Either feed them to hanibal lector or put them in buffalo bill's pit. 
---
I have the code, also 
---
Theres no limit but there is a cooldown of about 3 hours
---
I might have to. I am not a huge fighter, more of a wanderer. But I still live in my armor because the weight perks and the feeling of safety it gives me. I don't make my own fusion cores, nor do I have a generator that does (I saw one at someone's camp once. Looked like an amazing commodity to have). So I just scavenge around for them. It was a bitch to have built up so many for all of them to crap out in one go.
---
I'll help out haha my gt is DJesusSoG
---
What
---
So someone using a TSE as it is meant to be used is taking advantage?
---
Im sorry you cant handle people using their best weapons to kill players.
---
People like you make this sub a shithole tbh.
---
Instead of holding bethesda responsible for they shoddy made game or their shit servers you want to report people for building how they want with no maliciousness on their part.
---
Reminds me of the people who wanted to report others for using console commands in fo4
---
Outstanding, thanks!

Laggy servers will cause this, just log out go have a coffee then log back in.

Listen, this is a whole other debate to be had. Of course I don't think they should be working around the clock 24 or over the entire holiday. I've been in that position, and it sucks.
---
BUT! Releasing a game in this state, half assing it for 3 weeks, then going almost completely dark is unacceptable. At every game company there are (or should be) people that are very passionate about what they do. Some of those are younger and don't have families or personal lives and would rather be at work.
---
Most companies will also seek out these types of people. Take modders from the FO community for example. There are tons of them that would kill for the chance to work on this game.. probably for peanuts and probably over the holidays.
---
At the VERY least, there should be a community manager hanging out on reddit and saying something. Like "yes(or no), those who are using the X item are exploiting", or "hey guys, our biggest priority is X right now and we really appreciate the feedback and reports"
---
Like 1 person...
---
And, yes I know it's "just a game" blah blah blah.. but it's more to some people. and should be more to others.. like a multi-million dollar piece of consumer entertainment that people spent a lot of money on.

And I am pretty sure sentinel only drops on 3* armor.  Don’t think you will find any 2* Sentinel.

I've had more ce-34878-0's on FO 76 on PS4 pro than I've ever had with all other games I've played on PS4 and PS3.

Lucky, I’m still searching for it.
---
The rooftop of the spa in northern Berkeley Springs always has a handmade rifle spawn on the shelf (unless someone else has already grabbed it). For rng I found a heavily-modded lvl 45 handmade in the chest at the General’s Steakhouse close by there.
---
The servers are fragile in the first place. I've encountered your situation as well, but I've crashed the game for others multiple times without breaking the carry limit. While map farming, I bought a few hundred maps off of players, letting them build up before I went on my expedition. I don't imagine I had an absurd amount, probably 250 total. This alone was enough to crash the game for people around me if I attempted to dig or scrap any of my loot. After this happened, I did some testing. I stashed all my maps except for the area I was in, and was able to collect maybe 5 maps worth of loot before it would be too much for my game. Other's around me didn't seem to have an issue with this. I theorize that the server's aren't the issue as much as it's people's connections to eachother. When you enter an area with someone else, you're data transfer is connecting to theirs.
---
Everything in this world has a 'load order,' or steps in which a process occurs. When players have the amount of items, like you posted, the server has begun an extremely fast process of organizing the player's inventory one by one, by one and displaying it in a human readable form. When another player enters this person's range the server now has the task of reorganizing that information in a way that would be possible for the next player to view. Depending on how well they've connected to the server and how well you've connected to the server this can cause stability issues. The load order has priority settings which means it wants to finish loading what it's doing before loading something else. This is why you might lose some of the world while your inventory and character design will remain intact. Hence your 30 seconds to unfreeze. I imagine the issue is more with the way they've designed the transfer of information from one player to another, rather than the amount of information being shared. 
---
So, with this, I've encountered players with similar amounts of inventory and not had any instability. I'm not knowledgeable enough either to pinpoint any problems, this is just speculation.
---
I'm not pro-exploit whatsoever, and I realize this is a drastic amount of inventory that's just ridiculous. I'm just suggesting the issue might be more in the game's design and connection to others rather than the player's inventory.
---

I’m the same, I go to nuke zones if they launch in my server but I don’t launch them myself. Live in the PA cause I’m still waiting for Bethesda to give us a bit more stash space lol. Don’t make my own cores, and just loot them too. But honestly since I upgraded that perk to lvl 3, I don’t even worry about actively hunting down cores anymore. It’s pretty sweet. 
---
Thanks, I hate it.

I recommend visiting the Morgantown airport. In the back of the third hanger there is a locked red wooden crate with meds. I found 39 stimpacks without any med perks.

I delayed till level 50 and had to fight a bunch of level 40+ deep mirelurk kings and also you don't fight the wendigo until the end and I killed my level 40+ wendigo with a level 45 bladed board and no actual melee build.
---
Trust me, its not that bad.

Happens to me every time. I’m on PS4.
---
You put it in simple terms but it's nice to see another person who actually gets this. And then dupers are mad and wonder why they get downvoted to Oblivion
---
noob!
---
You have to build them. armor workbench for the clothes, paint can be applied to certain weapons at the weapon bench, I think you can expand the emote roster.
---
oh and paint can be applied to power armor at a power armor work station.
---
The high-level enemies she's encountering are likely due to the flawed level-scaling of enemies.
---
Basically, after an area has been cleared, the next time a player enters an area, the game will respawn enemies based on that person's level. Unfortunately, some areas are popular areas for high-level players to pass through; if the high-level player doesn't fully clear the enemies, the high-level enemies will still be there when a low-level player enters the area later (instead of the game respawning appropriate-level enemies).
---
When your sister encounters much-higher-level enemies populating an area, what she needs to do is quit to the main menu, then select "Play" again, to hopefully get placed into a different server with appropriate-level enemies in the area.

4 pulled out 2 power armour frames from my stash, deployed it, found it wasnt the suit i was after, pulled the other power armour fram from my stash and deployed it . Took the higher level armour off the first deployed suit and as i chose to enter the suit of power armour of power armour the game froze.
---
Upon exiting the game and returning the frame had disappeared and the armour i had taken off was still in my inventory. I pulled put the last power armour frame from my stash and deployed it from my inventory and upon trying to enter this suit the game froze again.
---
I closed the game and this whole suit has now disappeared too including all the armour pieces that were on it, the higher level armour pieces are all i have left and no power armour frames at all.
---
Kinda getting over all these faults, i just got to level 26 and the bugs and constant server issues are destroying the gameplay.
---
Looks like a carpet
---
Duping has existed in many online games dude. The trick is to crash before it can save somehow, forcing it to use an old file.

please don't, instead offer them incentives for finding additional bugs that benefit players unintentionally in private channels

Power swing in power armor uses an ungodly amount of FC charge. You can see it decrease every swing.

Same with the trumpet and the acordian as well.

Ik i have to build them. The items are not there is the problem.
---
Nothing from it is showing up. Not even in the atomic shop.
---
But i have the dlc downloaded.
---
Not enough sinister undertones for my tastes.
---
Idk what exactly you mean since it's worded kinda weird, but you start with 1 point in every stat and you add more as you level up, so you can add 1 card equal to the amount of points you have available. After you hit level 50 you can respec any stat for every level you get after that and move it to another stat. I'm not sure if that's what you wanted to know.
---
In the Arena at the cabin area north of Top of the World.
---
I'm not sure if this is the same bug, but I had an issue playing holotapes in terminals. Dropping some of the holotapes I had in my inventory helped. 
---
Best way Bethesda could fix this, is once they get the duping under control. Release content with a higher level cap. Nerf the weapons currently out and just put more of a incentive to get the new stuff/Crafting higher level weapons. Then none of the duped stuff ( weapons/Armor) even matters anymore.
---
Also why people bashing ESO for not being a direct skyrim port was silly. This flat out doesn't work on this kinda scale without gigantic infrastructural and systemic changes that then makes it not a fallout or elder scrolls game.
---
Without being in the area? Not that I know of man.
---
Simply that in reality it's the only solution you can actually pursue.
---
Im a idiot for thinking the game is bad? I feel you...lol the logic
---
See code?
---
I think its glitched? It's even telling me the same thing but I havent launched this week
---
Bullshit.
---
Someone glags this fucking player for duping. BETHESDA looks at their server history, and how often they fuck something from their exploits, BAN.
---
NO MERCY  for the ones ruining it for the normal people.
---
Is that a personal cool down or a server cool down per silo?
---
This post makes me miss my dad. We used to play NES together before he passed away. I would have loved to be able to play this with him now. I’m so glad that you have been able to share this with your son. :) it warms my heart. 
---
Know how close you can be to the launch without dying?
---
Yeah I have a base a stone’s throw north of Watoga close to the water area with the Mirelurk Queen and there’s a random event in my backyard where the mannequins show up.
---
So the way I see it. The only way to solve all of this nonsense is to just finally allow private servers. This would eliminate the crap that I see people complain about so much. So lets separate ourselves from what we don’t like and give us the option to join online where we know people are going be absurd (and remove pacifist mode)it would also eliminate the need for Nurf-Ing anything.
---
Do you know where in white springs?
---
Well that worked out wtf
---
I mean; the blame for the lag/crash events lies on the exploiters.  (you don't HAVE to lag the server out performing an obviously unintended action).
---
But the blame for the lag/crash events being possible is obviously bethesdas fault.
---
So the blame is shared; but only one party *intended* or knew the results of what they were doing.
---
The blame is different; and non-comparable, but only one of them is malicious in intent.
---
Thanks. Operation run like hell will probably be my downfall lol
---
I did it all, it just needed code. Thanks mate. 
---
I like it, wore it for ages. You don't have to wear the hat. 
---
Yep, around the stone gazebo thingy in the middle of the resort. 
---
There’s not many good stealth pistols compared to stealth rifles. Not that they are bad, but rifles tend to be better. 
---
If you really want to use a pistol use a silenced automatic 10mm. With a good stealth build it will kill most enemies and some scorch beasts with ease. 
---
Nope. 
---
Turn on pacifist. Running around with pacifist off is leaving your caps up for grabs. Unless your doing PVP, pacifist stays on 100%.
---
Yes use diluted rad away one at a time to gamble them away.
---
I didnt even enter a code it told me I already did one this week lmaoooo how did this work
---
Can you post a screenshot for me? I'd like to give it a quick look for ya. Will look to see if this has been updated when I get home

The serum effect of having the negative effect suppressed only lasts one hour. Pretty sure it works, but it would be very wasteful to use a serum for this
---
Where do you get grognak's axe?
---
I have 100 cloth
---
No idea, but hoorah for us
---
And don’t forget super super perk for even more salves, if you are lucky ofcourse!
---
+karma 
---
Chief.., this just aint it. I dont agree with duping but if its in the game than obviously people are gonna exploit it. Its like that in every game and there will always be poeple enjoying their best weapon in every game and im sure killing people once or twice isint gonna stop them from using thier guns or exploiting the game. So no matter how good you envision your cause it is truly pointless. Theres too many people out there at this point destroying other players and the games economy to do anything about and I doubt youll get all of that gear for a couple sets of PA and 500 caps. Sometimes u just gotta got on that grind and if your not gonna exploit you better get on it and spread knowlege of how to get off your feet and get going in the game than shielding other players temporarily from something inevitable. If you choose not to listen then good luck with your mission.
---
I thought I read severe people were saying you could tame that death claw at the sun station north of Watoga?
---
I have never tried taking anything but I read follow this sub closely. 
---
And still selling their items for 15k
---
Nope. That's too much salve. 
---
Jk, you right. 
---
Illogic, plus the illogical need to whine and complain when you could simply stop playing
---
If you have the plan for potted plans, this is one of the variants. But you’re right, most of the potted plan variants are dead plants. Also, this isn’t an ATOM shop plan. 🙂
---
You can change stats after level 50? This is the first I'm hearing of this.
---
I thought that you just needed wasteland whisperer not animal friend as well, so I could be very wrong!
---
Oh lord
---
Pulling up your menu to pop chems in 76 doesn't make sense. Either you hotkey them or it's useless to try and use them because the AI is getting free hits 
---
Now that, is determination, my friend!
---
Yeah, I've seen the defense of "it makes end game items available for early players because they can sell them cheaper" 
---
Yeah ok. I have yet to see anyone doing that and not actually just trying to greed and scam poor noobs
---
It’s actually weapons and armor that doesn’t stack. Having 1000 separate items is worse then having two stacks of a  million each.. 
---
Without persistence, Workshops feel like they're only good for plans and a smattering of stimpacks. It'd be cool if u waited until I got my damn reward and I could move on tho.
---
If you reload all the time you get longer life out of it from my experience from my two shot falling laser
---
Ooooh this changed everything! I used to wear the red dress, switched recently to sequined but I think fringed would be better. Always avoided it because of the hat.
---
I'm pretty sure he's like 90000000000000000000.1m over
---
They most likely exploited, but it is possible to just grind through. There is no level cap afaik, at least not one anybody has found yet. I'm at level 152 even though I don't farm whitesprings (by FAR the highest exp yield for your time) and bought the game after the beta. Some people played the hell out of the beta and were as high as level 70 before the game even launched
---
I was more implying that your "To whomever " is incredibly vague because of how commonly it is nuked.
---
Out of curiosity, which platform?  And if console, which version(XB1, XB1S, XB1X, PS4, PS4P)?
---
The PA paints and owl mask are almost certain from a dev room or something like that. So on top of duping, lagging out servers, ruining the game economy, etc, exploiters are also taking any mystery out of the game with this kind of stuff about potential upcoming content zzz
---
Farming a nuked whitesprings is insane. Went from 123 to 136 in just a couple hours. 
---
Yuuup
---
Since duping has come around, I've only seen a rise in prices.
---
It's insane. 
---
I'm currently waiting for a nerf on legendaries because of it.
---
Or a massive rollback, like Diablo 2 and 3. 
---
Which will suck for anyone that purchases the items.
---
This \*has\* to be easy to detect (I know nothing about game development, so that's kind of hyperbole).   
---
God damn we need an actual ban wave. 
---
Yup you need both from what I’ve read 
---
I've been seeing the same thing. I did a *ton* of server hopping in Watoga trying to get full level 50 sets of T-51b and T-60 on all 3 of my characters as well as nabbing some extra pieces for friends and I'd check the vendors every time - I saw most of the mods for sale, but as for actual plans for the mods, the vendors only ever sold motion assist servos and some bracers.
---
You have no chance to survive make your time.
---
How exactly do you transfer to a mule? Two copies of the game? Or have a friend in that game so you can rejoin the same server?
---
I've got 1 spare. 1.5k caps. Psn is the same.
---
Man, I forgot where exactly, but I remember reading through a terminal with multiple entries, and I was shocked at the n hi mber of spelling mistakes and names inconsistencies throughout.  Literally every page, and I don't think they were on purpose.  Like basic spellcheck should have caught them.
---
Yep. Bad apples ruin the bunch. Every damn time.
---
They spawn for everyone. 3* lvl 50s spawn for me an I did mayor for a day a loooooong time ago
---
Must have those server resources with those high quality bags
---
Yeah, sorry, I was saying that as in I've been wrong before so don't trust me :p
---
Suggestion: 
---
You could make some serious caps by offering to run people through the Scorched Earth event with the queen. I'd easily pay 100-200 caps for a run through lol I've fought her 4 times now and havent won :/ 
---
Level 69 rn. Switching stats rn for new build. Involves taking a perk level away from one and adding it to another 
---
I think even if the stash weight was 10K we'd all be fine, as long as nobody has THAT MUCH in their inventory. 
---
Ive seen elsewhere that they stood on the cap itself and was just slid off when it raised up. 
---
tbh, I was playing Vice City when I was 8. Violent games *really* aren't that big of a deal depending on how you contextualize it with your child.
---
Energy weapons are super anemic right now and need a massive buff... like they're supposed to have been replacing ballistic stuff, and yet they somehow get outdone by fucking civil war black powder weaponry?
---
Dumb as hell.
---
No, still selling their items for $7.49
---
Back to the DMV with you!
---
Someone did show a screenshot of a player (undoubtedly exploited the EXP glitch at the time) who was above level 1600, so yeah definitely no cap
---
They don't care enough. They get the money, good enough for them.
---
If they cared, no matter how involved the fix would be, they would've done ANY kind of damage control. A temporary fix, even saying something about it. They give nylon bags and does everything to avoid giving canvas replacements, they don't care about you, they don't care about me, they care about their money. They don't even care about their employees, whom I bet get plenty of hate mail. Todd Howard doesn't care, he's too busy counting his money. If a fix is coming, it's only to shut us up once, to make us say "they're finally listening", not because they do the right thing.
---
They simply don't care.
---
Yup, when you level up you'll be able to choose either another perk card or choose to move one point from a stat into another stat.
---
Fallout 76 is not a competitive game. 
---
Bethesda released this game half baked and full of exploits and of course players are going to use the exploits. 
---
I dont think it should be a permanent Ban but I do think they need to have some kind of detecting system that will delete character that have a ridiculous amount  of weight or even just stright up delete all the items they have.
---
But a Ban in a Fallout game? The only ones they are hurting are them selfs by ruining the game. Once you have unlimited items the game would get pointless. 
---
There are ways to fix the duping epidemic without Baning players.
---
Whitesprings bunker vendor
---
You just be able to hit the apporpiate key and delete it, on xbox would be X. I know there is a bug if you store an item with a connected wire it might not be able to delete it, bit in your case it should be able to delete it depending on your platform.
---
Good to know. Kept meaning to grab a photo at the site, just always forgot to.
---
Perhaps you've seen. Has someone grab a photo at ground zero literal milliseconds prior to touchdown?

For me, once I was lvl 50 and had decent PA plus one weapon where I could not die in 20s during a whitesprings nuke, the lvl's came really fast. One very friendly guy teamed up with me and we would each take a hit of a goul and then one would finish it off. They give crazy xp, and I think I gained 12 lvls during that one nuke. I gained 40 lvls in half the time past lvl 50.
---
Dupers should absolutely be banned, but fuck man, when are they going to fix this shit? Something like this should have been a relatively immediate hotfix. The fact that it hasn’t been shows either how fucked to this engine actually is, or how little Bethesda actually cares. 
---
If you're not so good at shooters, allow me to suggest a 15 AGI/LCK revolver build. 
---
You will be capable of dishing out massive damage with VATS crits almost constantly, and will be able to allow VATS to aim while you stay mobile.
---
 Bethesda said private servers were in the works. I just don’t think they will be available in the next 12 months. 
---
I'm 307 currently with no exploits and I stopped really grinding at 250.  If I continued I'd be in the 400s easy if not breaking the early 5s.  
---
I've seen at least one instance (that I can remember) of people justifying nuka rum and just now there was someone downplaying the canvas bag situation. the later, downplaying, is actually quite common.
---
Well, if you throw in a couple of 3* rolling pins or goul slaying gamma guns then you have a deal. 
---
Oh what a suprise! People are exploiting the game because Bethesda has failed to release a game in a decent state and fail to stay on top of this. People have and always will exploit games, you can never police people no matter how many of you whine and cry. Bethesda isn't doing nearly enough to stop this and it 100% lies with them. Granted if anything exploiters are showing that the current inventory limits really can be lifted up into 4 figures. 
---
Hats of to them though, I found the game boring as is yet alone exploiting for hours.
---
Uh probably 455. Theres no leveling exploits 
---
That’s just the thing, the duper’s do have millions of items on servers, and they are just fine. 
---
You know, I thought so too, but then I found a two shot explosive prime .50 cal machinegun at a vendor for 200 caps. It was fun for a whole 3 minutes before I realized this was almost guaranteed to be duped and was so overpowered it took all the fun out of the game anyway
---
You should be able to create separate blueprints of your different resources, for example if you had a harvestor and a generator, you should be able to create a blueprin for that .. or a bunch of water pumps .. the only thing I had a problem with was when I tried to build around the workshop and then tried to place it again in the same spot, so I blueprinted it 1 floor away from the workshop and it worked and then all I had to do was add the extra floor and walls.
---
I can complain, I payed 60 dollars for a broken game. Fan boy. Im not holding my tongue, Im pissed
---
I think I was in this battle with you. It was a nightmare.
---
&gt; if you damage their wings enough, they can't keep flying all the time
---
I'm about 90% sure that's how it works right now. Their wings will eventually heal and they'll be able to take off again, but while they're crippled, they're grounded.
---
Crippling their head doesn't prevent their sonic spam bullshit, though, and it absolutely should.
---
Owl mask?
---
That seems like an awfully destructive method of "solving" this problem. "You guys can't bully us, we will all kill ourselves first!" "You can't commit any terrorist attacks, we will blow up our whole city first!" Duping to discourage duping is the same thing. 
---
Pretty much all the highschools
---
Iirc like 2 months ago there were some exp glitches. Not sure if there was ever a way to replicate it since I think Bethesda patched it after 2(3?) weeks.
---
Pause at 1:34. The very first screen after the pip boy is the screen where you put a point into  your choice of SPECIAL.
---
The author of the video has moved through that part quickly, but it’s there...clear as day. 
---
I have never experienced a roll-back because of a crash when playing an MMO because the server does a good job of saving constantly.  What you're describing just isn't a common occurrence.  I've seen plenty of duplication glitches over the years and none of them ever involved deliberately crashing your game.
---
If I see someone in my level range at a workshop, I almost always go there and try to kill them.
---
Bethesdas buggy laggy game is the problem with laggy servers, not dupers. It's like blaming the lady with 4 out of control children for holding up the queue when the real problem is that only 1 register is open when there should 5 open lanes. 
---
Why can’t you run class freak? It’s mandatory with healing factor imo. Speaking from experience. 
---
People do this now, I’ve come across three discord serves that constant hand out free stuff. 
---
If only the SPECIAL stats and perks weren’t random af
---
Yeah, those are the succulents.
---
I don't understand how people get all pissed off at a limit, and then have nothing  but problems when they go over that limit by using a glitch or exploit.
---
It's sorta like that limit was there because they are doing something that works so long as the players follow the rules....
---
I know this would be kinda annoying, bit it only opens when weapons are holstered. If you keep weapons drawn the. The mask will alwaysbbe closed. 
---
Yes, it has been posted here before
---
I built my house on a road and it caused Grahm to get stuck under ground. I moved my camp but haven't seen him since.
---
Thanks 
---
You could spam defuse grenade and flamethrower traps in the asylum for like a month after it was first discovered. It was I think 7xp or something and a couple resources per go, and it went as fast as you clicked. People just sat there after setting up macros and came out with tens of thousands of aluminum, frag grenades, etc. as well as being 20 levels higher after a couple hours
---
I have 420 of them
---
If I see this I'm definitely killing you 
---
I am a rifleman VATS/Crit build that stays in PA the majority of the time.  I carry 4 fusion cores max.   VATS will drain a fusion core faster than anything (even just spamming the vats button trying to locate enemies drains the core). 
---
But, With the perk that makes fusion cores last twice as long (I actually only use rank 2 for 60% longer) and the ability to log out in my PA to charge them up to 100%, I have never needed to carry or hunt for more cores. 
---
There are 22 workshop locations in the game, literally 1 per player if they wanted, I find most are untaken on Xb1 now days
---
[https://attackofthefanboy.com/guides/fallout-76-all-workshop-locations/](https://attackofthefanboy.com/guides/fallout-76-all-workshop-locations/)
---
Needs to be a level 70+ for me otherwise the cost of travel and initiating the pvp outweighs the payout for the kill.  
---
Well if you get a bounty they can mow your base down without consequence. 
---
Im lvl 246 atm unexploited
---
Learn how to craft them with plans (or find someone who can) and start to hoard blood packs. I've made quite a few for myself and my friend.
---
That way I can RP that it's sealed, with a sallyport containing the disinfection hoop as the pressurization/sterilization chamber.  I like the idea my friends can retreat with me into a place with some plants growing if a nuke drops and we can only go out in PA for a while.  In my case, the leafier plants are imagined to facilitate a similar situation to /u/Keithscott91 's post.
---
Considering how many high levels I see, I'm assuming they just play alot. 
---
Don’t have any legendary assault rifles do you? 
---
Launching now if you want to join, PMd ign 
---
The duping action doesn't require you to amass enough items to crash the server.
---
It exploits the fact that weapons are badly programmed to stack up to 1 byte numbers and the server doesn't know what to do with it stacking further than that.
---
The problem is the game being badly programmed, these actions wouldnt crash any well programmed game.
---
Remember, even if you're carrying 1million bobbleheads, the server only needs to care about 1 bobblehead and 1 4 byte integer. EXACTLY the same as if you were carrying a single bobblehead.
---
Yea. If you're running mutations, you need to sacrifice 5 points in luck. It's sort of just how it is really
---
Not once have I see a handmade rifle plan and before Id crossed on into the two areas one by harper's fery and the other by two watoga I've kept seening the same radium rifle plan. Bethesda needs to look into this.
---
Yeah but mashed potato factory &gt; Materials.
---
If that matchstick-looking motherfucker Asmongoloid can make a living at it, anyone can.
---
Just found one today at Whitespring. From the entrance near the station, front porch of row houses on the right, on top of a luggage
---
Everything in luck is dedicated to criticals. No room for class freak. I'm planning on getting rid of all my mutations and redo all of them with the serum. I just wanted to know if this would work instead. 
---
Good to see you had fun!
---
Gonna launch one myself, soon!
---
Okay bitch you mentioned me the fuck is it you want?
---
i dont use chems,  and i literally sneak all over the map also.   keep on doing you , ex's are ex's for a reason.  2019 cant stop you. 
---
So next nuke party, you're bringing the dabs?
---
my hobby is to take pictures of all the bears in all their situations, I just found one hunting a yao guai or 2 bears adrift in a river inside a boat box
---
My doors are unlocked, but have about 4+ punji boards immediately after. My base is only public for those with marsupial because I have an open second floor
---
Steal and lead, perfect for ammo. 
---
Do you mean the decon shower? If not, disregard this. If so, no I haven't crashed. Reason why is because of Fo4 CTD'ing for me due to them, had to learn how to minimize the lag from them. Place a pressure plate next to it so it flashes on for a split second, it won't cure a massive amount of rads in one go however.
---
Best of luck!
---
[here](https://imgur.com/a/1sWSsO2) I was wrong im level 26. I chose agility 3 times and nothing happened. none of my other specials went up.
---
I know its irrelevant to include other topics but isn't it the same with the royal jelly. Ive searching for that item and i know you can get em just from killing honeybees but also just a theory its another bug as well due to low-high level status.
---
Sounds like the event I was in about the same time, it just up and flew SW off the map.
---
I wouldn't even mind if they just reset everyone and removed their inventory.
---
*Nipple rubbing intensifies*
---
Never mind. I'm an idiot. I thought mutation serums came with no side effects. I didnt realize they only suppressed the side effects for an hour. 
---
I have been able to get on periodically but the atom store never loads
---
That's because the foundation of the game is fucked in more than one way.
---
Opening your inventory with 1 steel scrap should be the same as opening it with 2billion steel scrap. If it isnt its because the programmers messed up.
---
If we are talking realism, I wouldn’t have to drink 19 waters every 2 hours.
---
Was this on Xbox?
---
Agreed, but malicious intent and omission of truth/negligence in my opinion are comparable when it is a product that was sold at full price and advertised as such, it could have been pushed back, I would have preferred a more complete functional game than playing a beta for 12 months. This is not isolated to any one particular large publisher/corporation. It's how I feel about the majority of "AAA" titles these days unfortunately.
---
Sure exploiters shouldn't be doing it, but they can because of the program that was sold to them and everyone else. As far as I can tell they apparently haven't banned dupers either, only people using cheat engine.
---
I knew what I was getting into when I got this game, at least 2 of my friends had no idea and I even tried to warn them and they feel quite bitter about this release.
---
I fucking love this. Video games are in my blood, and it’s one of the few things I’m truly passionate about. Playing video games with my brother is the best and is one of the few things we really relate on. Shared passion is really the only thing that keeps some of the rougher families *close* when everybody reaches adulthood, and I wish I had something this awesome to share with anyone else in my family.
---
Keep trucking, it’s my favorite thing in the world to see families sticking it out through video games.
---
There's no need to put words in my mouth. I never said anything about how the ESRB rates games; I only pointed out that they do.
---
And I certainly never argued that the ESRB thinks tobacco worse than alcohol or "drugs". It's pretty clear that they don't. If anything, it's the opposite.
---
While the ESRB does take tobacco use into consideration (https://www.esrb.org/ratings/ratings_guide.aspx), it doesn't necessitate an M or even a T rating for the game:
---
http://www.esrb.org/ratings/Synopsis.aspx?Certificate=36029&amp;Title=Dust%3a+An+Elysian+Tail
---
http://www.esrb.org/ratings/Synopsis.aspx?Certificate=35999&amp;Title=Forgotton+Anne
---
Those were just the first two results for "Use of Tobacco" in the ESRB's database. There are many other E- and T-rated games with Use of Tobacco as well.
---
So tobacco use and reference is clearly noted by the ESRB (separately from "drugs" and alcohol) but doesn't per se require a rating any higher than E, much less prevent a game from seeing the light of day.
---
As for RDR2's rating, tobacco most certainly does not "fall under 'use of drugs'" in ESRB-land: if you read their rating sheet linked above, you'll see that they use the term "Drugs" to include only "illegal drugs," hence why alcohol and tobacco have separate categories. For RDR2 there is no mention of tobacco use/reference either in the content descriptors, which you provided, or in the very detailed ratings summary on its ESRB page. The ESRB therefore either missed the tobacco use in RDR2 or for some reason failed to mention it when they should have. Either way the ratings summary of RDR2 seems incomplete, and so we shouldn't be drawing conclusions about the ESRB's attitude towards tobacco use from it. Their other ratings make it sufficiently clear that they're supposed to mention Tobacco separately from Drugs and Alcohol - and that Tobacco Use doesn't per se merit a rating higher than E.
---
Where do u find longcoat?
---
That's nothing!  For maximum raider you need to find a workshop owned by someone who is obviously sitting at their camp.  Initiate the pvp after leaving a marker next to their camp area and go and wreck it while they are responding to the takeover warning.  Then patiently wait for them to come back, become stunned by seeing everything reduced to rubble, and put them out of their misery with one fell strike.   
---
How though?
---
I’ve kicked, screamed and crawled my way to level 43 playing alone and every achievement I’ve managed I’ve felt so good about, purely because sheer cussedness and determination has got me there. You’re doing fine! 💖
---
So you want polite pvp?
---
This isn't a perfect solution. What if people were unknowing and picked up a large stack of some item a duper created? This innocent person would be banned. It's easy to say that no one is that dumb or are lying, but you have to account for everything here.
---
Disagree.  Have been testing with a friend (at different elevations, camp locations etc) and the OP distance seems to be accurate, within about 5%.
---
All these upvotes and gildings. Hmmm, I wonder why.
---
But one would think 400,000 of anything would raise a red flag. I think that's more than copies of Fallout 76 sold.
---
The mighty sloth shall prevail.
---
Funny, I've received that exact same loot the last 3 queens I fought, a 1 star a ghoul slayer armor piece(never better then leather) and those same 2 plans. I'm lvl 109-111 during those fights.
---
I think pc, if it was the one I was at.
---
I’ve had that message on Xbox come up. A couple days ago I constantly got that message to the point where I had to hop. It was very frustrating.
---
What kind of legendaries do you have? Also, how long will you be doing this?
---
Only need 1 foundation under them, the other spot can be a floor if your working with uneven terrain. Helped a friend with those last night.
---
45 hours or so and I'm still enjoying it, level 30, PC. I still have a lot of quests left to do, playing it like a single-player game. Despite the lack of humans there's a lot of story and voice acting. And I'm surprised how much of it feels the same despite being client-server, like you can still kick barrels down hills (physics).
---
Gameplay's interrupted by server problems probably every 2-4 hours. Sometimes the server disconnects. Other times it just starts going on/off every few seconds (it disables controls until it reestablishes) until I disconnect manually and hop to another server, sometimes a couple times. Other times it'll do weird stuff like my camp turrets will drop to zero health and I'll hop servers again (and they'll be back to 100%). The client itself crashes maybe every 10 hours, like previous games.
---
Managing power armor's a little difficult. I can't distinguish different chassis' in inventory, and can't collect armor I just placed if it has high level pieces on it, though it auto-recalls in a couple minutes. And it has the same fusion core glitch as FO4 where it uses your full cores first instead of your partials, so you've got all these partials taking up 3 lbs each. I suspect the first two problems will be fixed soon, but the 3rd problem's been ignored for years so I don't know.
---
I haven't really used my power armor much yet (same as every other Fallout), since most of the game's been pretty playable without it. Though I can't beat a scorchbeast without cheesy tactics yet (tagging and letting the whitesprings robots do the work).
---
It's not about being good. It's about having fun. I hope you keep enjoying yourself, that's all these games are for. 
---
You've chosen strength every time lol 
---
Ah ok, just had something similar happen on xbox
---
Following...lol right. Because it's totally impossible to run into the same posters multiple times while we're all looking at the same thread. Don't flatter yourself.  
---
It didn't happen.  
---
And it wasn't even mildly amusing. Creative writing just isn't your thing.
---
That map actually squares almost exactly with my own tests.
---
Just looked at your image:
---
S13; P3; E3; C3; I3; A2; L5 = 32
---
You get one point every level; you start with 7;
---
If you’re now at level 26, then it is correct, you gained 25 points, which puts your at 32.
---
It doesn’t seem like you’re missing any points, looks like maybe assigned wrongly?
---
Every 15 -20 minutes. Especially when I'm picking a respawn point, the game always crashes.
---
&gt; Kill a queen or farm legendaries. 
---
Kill a queen? you mean get her to 5% hp just for her to fly out of bounds and stay there?
---
Congrats on the new pet my dude
---
Your best chem cocktail.... bitch!
---
I see what you mean, but I am level 68 and I still haven’t built excavator power armor yet, so this method was super helpful to me. 
---
Really you should be able to tame animals from like level 40 if they are the right creatures. I have been meaning to write something up about this for a while but I I will give you the short version :P
---
There are two guaranteed places I can tell you that you will get animals to tame. You will most likely need to server hop to find one but if you keep up with it you will defiantly find them......eventually.
---
So position number one is the lake next to the Thunder Mountain Energy plant (east side of the map). Fast Travel to the Power plant and head south and run along the south side of the shore of the lake until you find pieces of a crashed yellow plane. From here I have tamed a Mega Sloth, a Rad Toad and a Yao guai but there may be more. 
---
This is where in the map you want to mark (where my player icon is set): [https://imgur.com/YlHLJwX](https://imgur.com/YlHLJwX)  
---
This is what the plane pieces look like: [https://imgur.com/GbavR07](https://imgur.com/GbavR07)
---
Just a head up this does glitch a few times so if you see a dead Yao guai floating in the air that was probably the tamable animal, I have seen it loads of times: [https://imgur.com/kRYsuSY](https://imgur.com/kRYsuSY)
---
The second place is in the top right of the map. Fast travel to the Fissure Site at the top right to the map and run East (and run because there will be a Scorchbeast there). Keep heading east and you will eventually come to a lake with a crash Vertibird in it. From here I have tamed a Snallygaster and a Rad Toad and I have seen other people found Mega Sloths and Deathclaws here as well.
---
This is where in the map you want to mark (where my player icon is set): [https://imgur.com/XJj2vzE](https://imgur.com/XJj2vzE)  
---
This is what the place look like: [https://imgur.com/AXgStja](https://imgur.com/AXgStja)
---
These sites also spawn some pretty interesting events sometimes so its normally pretty entertaining anyway and other times its more scary stuff (one time I went there and there were literally 3 Scorchbeast right on top of each other just above the ground). If you come across an Albino Deathclaw he is an event and is NOT an tamable animal, there is normally a dead Brahmin around him as well.
---
I am very interested in finding more of these sites if anyone knows of any really specific locations they have found animals that can be tamed.
---
You are a genius!
---
o.... my lordy....this. this is a mucho improvement! 
---
Or that, or kill it and get nothing. One of those things.
---
I have a 3 claw deathclaw gauntlet that does 
---
50% limb damage 
---
Ignores 50% of enemies armor
---
Plus 2 strength 
---
It's my favorite weapon. Just wish i could use it in PA
---
If your level 25 all the points seem to add up to 33. So minus the 7 you start with. I don’t see what your talking about. Maybe you put the point in strength but choice a perk from a different category
---
This location is amazing !
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/xDa5RQ4
---
I like this.
---
I dont think are too high depending upon if they started in beta. all my levels are legit and I spend a lot of time goofing off. Ive only been playing since launch am level 244 now.
---
on PS4!
---
Oh so you're one of those people, huh?
---
Ia it launched?
---
Grahm services you
---
Affirmative =/
---
I've killed her about 6 times now, and in all but the first two her corpse was either unlootable or just straight up disappeared. That fight is incredibly un-fun and a massive drain on your resources, and on top of having to luck into getting her to drop what you want, you also have to luck into being able to loot her in the first place. I love this game, but the SBQ is such bullshit.
---
wHAT! Today was a weird day! PS4/XBOX/PC all the same massacre!
---
On the floor of my CAMP. 1 weight per stim/ 1.5 for super stims is way too much when I have 400 weight of junk that I need for crafting.
---
all right I guess im just dumb. I tried choosing something other than strength but it never seemed to do anything.
---
thanks
---
This is cool. My son is 2, so I've not exposed him to fallout yet!:) maybe one day.
---
There is persistence, you just have to maintain it.
---
Did you make a video showing how its done?  Have you provided anything other than crying about it on reddit to help solve the problem or does the magic bug fairy come and fix things when you sleep?
---
GTFO
---
Did you use the 2 spawn points near Abbie's bunker. Has any1 found a good spawn point for a wolf? I really want to have a wolf pet
---
Very nice. My pet death claw is probably my favorite thing in the game right now. 
---
Hey, once the meat spoils in 5 seconds you can have sone great fertilizer
---
&gt; But also they could just temporarily put a cap on item stacks 
---
They did.
---
Glitchers found a workaround within the hour.
---
The problem is that right now it feels like we bought a quarter of a game that ends with an unresolved chapter 1 (and nothing to do afterwards, farming legendaries is meh, killing the queen works 50% of the time).
---
Most games have multiple "stages" or "chapters" but the story for this one is literally going through each faction saying "Yeah, its fucked" and moving on to the next till you meet enclave, then launch a nuke.
---
The fact you can skip literally half the game and meet enclave first makes this disconnect seem even worse, you SHOULD need to do the quests in order to get to the enclave and launch your nuke. And to whoever says that it would suck because some of the quests are long and boring, well, what about not making quests that have 0 depth outside a single holo tape.
---
(There were about 2 points in the story where i felt shit went down, and i don't have any main quests left to do)
---
i think your right, i thought i chose agility and endurance but i guess it went to strength
---
+karma
---
It might be worth a shot to call on a few from the other side and see if maybe just maybe we can get a reply. Regarding what they finally intend to do about duping.
---
Fingers crossed they are allowed to.

Hey lads 
---
We have already done this dance before here.
---
But considering its another week its worth asking again. Can we please, please get some communication from you lads. It would be really nice if we could if its not too much to ask.
---
it was working fine in the last location i had my base but since i moved it its just been crash after crash after crash... got fed up with it finally so just disconnected the power to it
---
Does diluted work? I thought only full rad away has a chance to cure ? Diluted just heals the rads?
---
i gotta be able to beat things with my death tambourine and carry the weight of what I done
---
The really should have put a cool Easter egg for just such a occurrence. The is quite the climb though. :D
---
Sending nuke
---
Hey it happens can’t go wrong with strength anyway.
---
It could be that there's more things to load in the surrounding environment than the previous one.
---
yep, some "boss" mobs i killed disappeared without turning into a meat pile; especially the ones i killed by explosives.
---
"I ***am become*** death"
---
something isn't grammatically right about that
---
You have acces to the wood ones. The stones, warehouse etc you need plans to find in the world or by taking workshops.
---
\&gt;they should be working overtime and postponing vacation
---
wow
---
Playing on Xbox. And even the Fallout 4 and Skyrim mod-support is great, I‘m looking forward to an NV X-Enhsncement more than some 3rd party totalconversions. 
---
Gained 1k+ of any item on a single occasion. Item deleted.
---
Gained 1k+ of any item on two occasions, inventory and stash deleted.
---
Gained 1k+ of any item on three or more occasions, account deleted.
---
Pretty simple search query. 
---
&gt;they should be working overtime and postponing vacation
---
&gt; The fact that you are that level either means you play this game A LOT  or that you used experience exploits, which would leave me to believe  you use other exploits. 
---
2 accounts, the client will launch twice, logged in under different user names..
---
No exploits, I just have more than once account.
---
Nah I don't want it at all. I just have to either gather thousands of caps to get certain plans or claim a workshop in two minutes and get caps exp and stimpacks as a bonus. 
---
Not as much a problem with PVP just with other design elements that are forcing PVP on me when u just want to get some free stuff. 
---
So what 100k is nothing.
---
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/vZa60i3.png) an example from another game.
---
That's 370 pages, each with 144 slots and each slot can contain a literally unique item carrying 4-8 different mods from a pool of multiple hundred stats with varying rolls. This is just me, one player, other players have 1000 pages and more without it affecting server performance in any way.
---
100.000 times $item(ammo\_556) is a complete joke for any database and the load it causes.
---
This is unrelated to the process stalling spawning items quickly causes currently.
---
The way bethesda spawns items into their games just isn't built for doing that.
---
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
The stash limit is there so you don't stash everything you find and stop looting things.
---
Exploration and looting is what the game consists of, without the need to go out and collect stuff many players would just sit in their base, get bored and log off.
---
The limited stash space makes you actually think about what to keep and incentifies going out and having fun.
---
Any more fake shit to show me as "proof"? You might take me for an idiot, but I'm not one. Keep on scamming.
---
Yes. Use some RadAway or a Decontamination Chamber.
---
They only go to lvl 45 ;)
---
Updated main post to show them another new video that the dupers have figured out how to do it even faster.
---
https://youtu.be/hRQV3Nwe928
---
I'm not sure but it did seem like I was hard to spot when I used more.
---
They have LITERALLY said, in offical statements, that stash size is because of server limitations.
---
Fair point but defending from normal enemies is easy. At leaat other players mix it up and make it hard
---
Yasssss girl! Glad you’re having fun!
---
You can farm certain event quests to hopefully get the plan for free, regardless of level (as far as I have read). I will try to remember to post the links to it when I get home from work, but I have been doing quests to try to get the handmade blueprint as well as a few others.
---
might be there are more objects closer to the base now than there where before i moved it
---
I like the Black Diamond, but I got it at a low level. A good substitute is the Blade of Bastet which can be upgraded to higher levels
---
I'm also fond of my Vampire's Rolling Pin but it's totally useless.
---
Damn right, preserved insta-mash above all else 
---
As I said more than once, I have two copies of the game, actually 3 now.
---
The client will launch more than once, if you PC can handle it, and run with different user names  
---
I have a quad western you can have if you're on xbox
---
On my mobile, easy mistake to make.... and clearly name calling strengthens your points a ton...
---
Those XP glitches were *horrendously* slow, if I remember right, to the point where it would take several hours just to get a couple levels. Farming Whitesprings is far more efficient than that glitch ever was, even on PC where macros probably greatly sped up the process. Even if someone did abuse that glitch to some absurd amount, they would have gotten much higher had they just farmed Whitesprings, so odds are all the highest level players got there legitimately, they just put in an ungodly amount of time to get there.
---
i have this happen when i start playing for the day. after 2-6 crashes im fine for a few hours before i crash again 
---
Love the OP story! It was the same for me in many ways. Never played a fallout to this level. I didn't know what I was getting into. Rolled the dice and now I am hooked. I love how F76 could be a community/group based activity from the chaos of taking down the Scorchbeast Queen or something very solitary like modding your gear at a workshop with the junkers and radio going. Very cool experience. Once the game finds it's sea legs the upside is tremendous. Thanks OP for reminding me there's others out there who decide for themselves!
---
I felt bad killing a puny level 5 over his workshop today, but I wanted the plans for my camp (first time claiming that workshop) and he wouldn't move.
---
Did you drink dirty water?
---
For little annoyances, Bowie Knife. Minor inconveniences (and chuckles), Death Tambo. Serious threats, Grognak’s Axe
---
Use Diluted Radaway, or activate a decontamination arch and sprint through it so as to only get hit once. There's no way to specifically remove one mutation, it's random.
---
Just because you've not seen something does not mean it cannot be obtained by the same quest, RNG Loves some people and hates others...
---
I'm lvl 297 and have only pulled 3 explosive weapons, and zero TSEs.... RNG can be a brutal mistress.
---
Have..... You tried?
---
At least you realized it 
---
Yes we both tried our codes and they do not work. Sorry should’ve added that in the post haha
---
Wish my dad played fo76. Lol. 
---
you can turn in two at a time for a higher level reward......
---
When you select a Perk Card at level up, you will assign the point to that card’s attribute.
---
You can back out to view cards available for the other perks; the point isn’t assigned until you pick a card.
---
Then you have to assign a card, which doesn’t have to be the card you picked, to the perk.
---
That’s how I’ve been doing it on the PS4.
---
Does the chameleon armor work the same way as the mutation where you aren't hidden if you move?
---
Last night I found a [Vampire's Rolling Pin](https://imgur.com/L33RxZ3).
---
BTW as it came up below, did you hand them in one at a time? 
---
If you do exactly (2) you get a higher level reward....
---
Have myself a crit glass cannon sniper build. Before it was finished, my bloodied dragon was doing 996, and 1600+ with s.i.n. Now that the build is finished, (with about 30% more damage) my dragon does 1199 base, but only 1300+ with s.i.n. There may be something that got messed up in the last patch and is messing with mod damage in the formula. Not sure :/
---
You're hidden if you're not moving. 
---
Yes, just yes
---
Heard this too. The bot you can force spawn at Charleston says it and won't let me trade. I'm suspecting it's cause I haven't done the responder missions on this character. 
---
I think it's to get you to investigate the airport. Where their HQ is 
---
The reactor produces 3/hour when powered.
---
clearly name calling make you the smarter person... clearly...
---
No i just ate the soup, and theres no way I misclicked because for me glowing fungus soup is 4 items below dirty water.
---
You want the hunters long jacket? Random event spawns a vendor bot at Charleston station. There's a chance he sells it.
---
Or you buy from someone
---
Holy hell that's a lot of writing but yeah over all the game is pretty good I just reached 120 hours on the game.
---
I can get about 2 levels in one day and I hardly grind.  There are some people who can do repetitive tasks for long periods.  I am not one of those people.  But if I was I imagine I could get at least 5-7 levels a day at Whitespring.  In 2 months 7 levels a day is 420 so....
---
It’s pretty great - and because it’s so difficult solo it really feels special when you finally do it! 
---
Thank you 
---
&gt;Banning dupers is an easy start. Should be pretty cut-and-dry to do. Database query for anyone with +100,000 of any item and ban. Seems pretty simple to me.
---
But your saying ANY item, not specific items.... So flawed premise
---
My dad is around your age. I wish I could get him into games like this, it would be a blast. He just works himself to death instead and never gives himself time to relax. I both envy you guys and am happy you got to share something like that. Thank you for sharing.
---
sell them on g2a and buy us codes with the money.
---
Not necessarily. Depending on your build and which mutations you've got, you can get by with just Starched Genes. My Pistols build, for instance, has 1 Strength, and you can't go below 1 in a SPECIAL stat, so Bird Bones and Eagle Eyes (which both give you -4 Strength) have no downsides for me.
---
That could be, I can't think of any other reason it'd be acting up all of a sudden. This one doesn't lag my game, the pressure plate is just for precaution due to Fo4. So I'm going to assume it's just a bunch of other things having to be rendered and such nearby, try out the pressure plate and see if it helps out even just a tad.
---
He’s talking about the people buying items.  But you’re both not wrong.
---
Proxy? Maybe haha. Not sure if you'd have problems playing or logging in once it was activated
---
BoS paints are coming when the faction pvp update hits. thats what customer service has sent people looking for why they can't get anything but initiate from technical data. They exist now because people are finding their way into a restricted cell (possibly qasmoke, the well known bethesda item archive cell in all their games) somehow and taking items from it. There are multiple people I have talked to and know that are offering the paints for free who got them donated to them or know how to get them, dont even give the time of day to people who charge for the PA paint schemes. 
---
It might be affected by the level of the players.
---
There's supposed to be "unruly golfers" that spawn there for a quest and people have [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a10bj0/unruly_golfers_quest_at_whitesprings/) player level as being the reason why they're so hard to find
---
You assume they are authorized to ban dupers. If 10 percent of active players are duping, I doubt management will sign off on banning them, maybe a temp ban.
---
I'd bet more than 10 percent are duping.
---
Where were you at the time and have you had any face mask?
---
Man my post made you real upset haha
---
&gt;here should be a way for people to "forgive" a bounty... I mean, if you're helping them and accidentally damage their stuff, Why should they get punished?
---
just keep pacifist mode on until you plan on putting someone six feet under, its a great solution since you can just pound three purified waters to keep your health level while you change it
---
Are you COMPLETELY hidden, like a scorchbeast could walk right by you in Glassed Cavern and not detect you or is it less than 100%?  I have level 3 Sneak and got detected in there in the last room while standing still although I did get almost all the way around the room to the other tunnel.  I just got the mutation today for the first time, but I didn't play around with it much.
---
It's literally all that's been posted about non-stop. SO when are you going to hold the developer accountable? 
---
Get power user under int. Dont use vats. Wont be a problem any more my friend
---
My main, not the mules..
---
And Yes... Yes I do.. Tonight I spent 90 minutes walking from Prime Rift to WhiteSprings (Train Depot just north) and enjoyed the hell out of it..
---
Why?
---
No fast traveling means I encounter tons of the random encounters, inevitably run into things I've not previously discovered and generally have a good time murdering the wild life and looting and pillaging the whole time.
---
"If" I get to the crushingly slow walk I'll pop some Chems, eat some ragstags,'tweak my perks for max carry weight / item weight reduction and keep going, and if I run out of Chems and Grilled Ragstag I might drop a thing or two, but generally if I'm inside the same region I'll suck it up and crawl back to my mules camp..
---
In the end it's my choice, my playstyle, and to be honest people like me (I'm not the only one) should not be caught up in a witch hunt lead by unimaginative and closed minded people..
---
Why are people so upset about duping? I get that they're exploiting a glitch, but if anything they are making the game more balanced. Instead of having to grind for dozens or hundreds of hours to complete a build, you can achieve it much faster by trading for top tier gear. This way everyone has access to it, so it won't be like some players have a blatant advantage over others. The legendary attribute system clearly wasn't thought out very well before they incorporated it into a multiplayer game, and thus way there won't be an elite group who can just abuse all other players.
---
im on xbox i can trade TheVeggiePiggy
---
&gt;  not when they murder low level players giving them a bad experience
---
TSE's have nothing to do with that, assholes are gonna be assholes regardless of the tools available to them. Besides, *most* people with TSE's don't do that.
---
I've never had the mutation. However, I have the sneak and whatever the other sneak agility perks filled to Max. I have one piece of chameleon armor and I can still sometimes be detected if they walk too close to me. So I'd say it's less than 100%. 
---
But, I'm not sure if more chameleon armor pieces stack for a higher sneak ability 
---
I have been server hopping for Cryolator plans for quite a while.  Time to go there in an alt, I guess.
---
Odd, I'm pretty sure I'd get dysentery having that irl though so +1 for realism xD
---
That’s what I’m also concerned about, if there is a way to redeem it (possibly having one of my EU buddies do it for me) will I be able to continue to play while in the US? Not really sure here
---
Considering they most likely can't place anything else, I think they're probably trying to make the best of a bad situation. There's at least one person out there with so many water purifiers that they can't scrap or place that they literally can't build anything in their CAMP. 
---
Oregon Trail sends it's regards.
---
If that's actually true and not them trying to cover something up, then this is a whole new level of Fo76 ridiculousness.
---
Hey there, wanted to address an issue I’ve been having, haven’t found anything online regarding the issue, 
---
On occasion when I’m exploring, I would enter a specific area, be it building or wilderness, all enemies in said areas just die, straight up, no explanation. Like someone types in a kill all command... very confusing and frustrating! I’ve missed out on my fair share of Legendary items because of this! (Didn’t get kill credit so all bodies were empty) 
---
I do not know if this topic has already been discussed. Thanks!
---
But what if I just happen across a box of drugs in a back alley?
---
Were you being attacked by a diseased enemy while eating? Were you standing in water? Were you out in the Ash Heap without protective gear? Is it possible that you ate something else by mistake? Are you absolutely certain there was *nothing* else around you that could have given you the disease? If so, then it was a bug, but it's the first I'm hearing of it.
---
If Xbox works like Playstation, you could create a EU account, redeem the code and download the game. Then just play the game on your US account. I bought the game on the US store, but play on my Asian account.  Of course, things may work differently for Xbox. 
---
Best I can do is 5.
---
How many caps you got?
---
Im a "Leroy Jenkins" type of player who never sneaks any place in game or in life. Your ex boyfriends are morons. Games like Fallout are about the journey. Rushing to the "end" is not good gaming, it's what small people do to give themselves a little accomplishment badge.
---
 I hope you meet some better people, as someone who has never been able to find a female gamer to date, I think any male gamer should be very happy to find a womyn to just pick up a controller or a keyboard and mouse.
---
 Like most things in life, screw everyone else and do your best to enjoy yourself. 😁👍 
---
It’s all about the Salisbury
---
You mash heads are scum!
---
that's AWESOME.   gr8 shot!
---
I don't like the chems they always show up when I want stims lol
---
No. They knew the holidays were coming up when they decided to release for that sweet Christmas cash. Now they have to deal with the negative image hit from launching a very much unready game.
---
Can you tell us where exactly it spawned and what level is it?
---
If it dies does it stay dead?
---
Yes... 
---
Mules can cause a problem... 
---
I reached a point where My armor and weapon mules were causing server instability, and being a responsible gamer, who has reported dozens and dozens of bugs I took the steps to fix it, as I wait for Bethesda to do what's needed..
---
I split the holdings up among another sets of mules..
---
If I had 12 of legendary XX I ditched the 10 with the worst durability..
---
I gave tons of stuff away (which I do frequently anyway)
---
I sold tons of stuff at great prices..
---
With the tweaks I spent 5 hours on the same server yesterday, with all (3) of my accounts running, buying, selling and murdering, and it was stable and happy..
---
Point is anything taken to an extreme can cause problems, RL or virtual, but if we all play "responsibly" (and that includes avoiding witch hunts, spreading false / bad information, etc) it works...
---
At this point they need to take a play from square enix's playbook and reboot the whole game but tie it to the story. Final fantasy 14 released in a similar crappy state and they revamped the whole game and tied it to the story with it being a story wide apocalypse scenario and the new game being titled a realm reborn..
---
So if someone picks up a dupers entire bag of loot, will that be 1 occasion? 
---
That is the best rendition of Squidward's Interpretive Dance I've ever seen. 
---
They are either dumb or self entitled
---
Game explicitly warns them that PvP is enabled at your shop should someone contest, they willingly accept this, and THEN moan if someone does it? What...?
---
I keep hearing about the spawn points near Abbies bunker, do you know where specifically they are?
---
It's coming from the airport control tower if you are looking to hear it on repeat for hours lol 
---
Aw glad theres something you like bud :) I just dont like the white legs on the x01/t60
---
Is that a backpack? 
---
That'll definitely get fixed first.
---
its for players to sell stuff its supposedly coming soon
---
I'm of the opinion that if you are going to spend the 2 points to use a couple of mutations it's only another 3 points to use many more and to improve on the rest you have.
---
Do not challenge rng! You WILL loose
---
Sounds about right, maybe eat somthing with a better name lol
---
Or loot that disappears just as you're about to take it. My god damn ionised meats. 
---
you see the 254 boards hes holding? thats all it takes to start the dupe glitch.
---
Did you wash your hands before you made it?
---
Normally these vendor bots are settled along the train tracks in shops. 
---
R/iamverybadass
---
So... it’s been posted non-stop which arguably would bring negative attention to Bethesda... how exactly do you otherwise expect anyone to “hold the developers accountable”? Lol. It’s a video game. They didn’t kill your dog. 
---
I have it written down for later. There's no rush to the game. Enjoy it for what it's worth.
---
Muting them is easier and safer.
---
They might get their dad after you. 
---
Yea yea badbad
---
Yeah but the special one, im lvl 167 and never seen it. Grahm and his mo mo i have met but
---
Dexter
---
If you are on pc write to me. I can craft it
---
Please remember guys this post could indirectly save lives in America too.
---
As a software developer it's actually completely nonsensical. Nothing that guy said meant anything. It was just a bunch of "tech" words strung together.
---
Oh no you’re busting out the fanboy argument. Sigh. Plenty of people admit there were problems. Constantly. In this sub. Everywhere. Pretending that a lot of the hate isn’t excessive is being willfully ignorant. Calling people that like the game despite its flaws fanboys is cheap and lazy. I’m done with you. 
---
Yeah, how dare kids try and have fun on a video game! I can't beleive they have the gall to buy the same game that we have equal accessibility to!
---
I don’t mind the competition. It’s not bullying, it’s part of the game. But I feel cheated when fuckface comes in the workshop with their duped TSE gun and insta kill me. There’s no counterplay to that. I don’t know why Bethesda didn’t consider that allowing those to legendary effects together wouldn’t be a disaster.
---
Very nitpicky and unnecessary change IMO 
---
Yea it opens if unarmed, but just put your fists up with no gun and it closes
---
I call bs
---
Cheating is cool... For us to watch your whole account getting banned with all your alts
---
Never should have blacked out dudes name
---
Play in Fullscreen, nothing else will improve FPS by much. I have a RTX 2080 with i7 6700k and i'm sitting at about 75 fps and 35-45 fps in very crowded places. FPS can get as low as 25 FPS if i'm running in those super crowded places. Outside of towns if i look in a place without activity i get sbout 85-110 fps. What resolution are you playing at? Because that gtx 1080 TI would be an overkill for 1080p. What i learned is that i have the exact same FPS at 1080p as i have at 1440p. More powerfull GPU's won't get you more FPS, they will only let you play the game at a highter resolution. The bottleneck will always be the CPU and as far as i read there is no powerfull enough CPU on the market to improve the FPS by much. If you upgrade your PC to a i7 it will improve FPS a little but my mistake was the DDRAM. I had 8 Gb of 2133mhz and added another slot of 8Gb to a total of 16gb of 2133mhz. I saw no difference in FPS at all. Then i read how extremly important is the speed of the ram. If i had my RAM at the frequency of 3000mhz i would probably have 10-15 more FPS.
---
the servers have a built in "rollback" feature incase you get suddenly disconnected, it will restore to an earlier point. people are abusing that system by dropping bags of loot with 254 boards in it (as you see in his inventory), and when you add more items to that same bag, it copies them instead of removing them from your inventory.
---
I could be wrong on the details because i dont use the exploit but thats how its been explained to me
---
What is the big ball of debris on top of that building? Theres also another one on an adjacent building
---
Where did you get the plan for it, I'm searching for days... :)
---
it just works
---
I would like that, I once claimed a workshop and the in same server i had to go to Whitesprings  vendors but all the robots turned on me. I couldn’t server hop without losing my workshop that I had spent tons on defense for it.
---
Actually, he's not. He's referring to [this](https://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-asks-suspected-fallout-76-cheaters-to-write-essay-about-why-cheating-is-bad/).
---
Bought it for 1k caps
---
Well when you start off with saying "most of" the hate is by people who never played the game, that was when it got cheap and lazy. I'm a fallout fanboy through and through but was disappointed in this game, but naturally the argument used against me is "never played it" or "you got your opinion from youtubers"
---
If only there was like a rating system for games to stop this kind of thing from happening
---
God. You're like Doom Guy levels of hard.
---
Damned farmers. Hate them though... They don’t giving to us opportunity to RP or even just have a good times in game
---
Crazy its almost like you can't mute people in the game or block them.....
---
Shame about that.
---
Yeah show them x rated movies too why not
---
White knights aren’t scrolling down this far.
---
Thank you, that was very descriptive! I also just found one in this exact location!
---
Already managed to get all together and it looks amazing! 
---
Ah, damn. I’ve found him around 10 times, but he never had those particular plans. At least he kept me entertained with his stories
---
Theres always lego
---
That only has x-01 mods
---
Alright thank you for the write up.
---
I'm wearing a gas mask
---
What a wondeful story! Thank you for sharing.   If I'd played on xbox I would've given her all of my extra plans and recipes. I've got a cracy amount of them.
---
Except there's no limit to what you can carry on your person, so what's the point of a stash limit?
---
Fort Defiance, Watoga Emergency Service, AVR Medical Center, Morgantown Airport
---
Check the mirrors too
---
You're more badass than Arnold Schwarzenegger, wow!!
---
It for sure will get better, it released mid November with 2 or 3 (can’t remember) updates so far that I’d say did improved the game. And there’s still tons more ahead.
---
It's an always online service that was rushed out pre-holiday season to capitalize on the gift giving season.    
---
Honestly, we're not giving Bethesda enough flak. They should have had the critical issues with the game fixed well before Christmas.  
---
It spawns near Charleston. Someone posted on here with instructions on how to server hop to spawn him a little while back. You can probably find the topic with a bit of searching. Also on the market subs people will usually post when they find him to help out
---
This, exactly.
---
Moron.
---
We need to be able to have separate button for menu. Pressing "esc" and seeng the map is INCREDIBLY bad. Make it like "m" is map, "esc" as menu. It's infuriating and counter intuitive.
---
We know which group you're in. Mental maturity inclusive
---
Assholes have figured out a way to duplicate ('dupe') weapons/items/armor etc. Say a person has 100 nuka colas, they can turn it into 10000 fairly quickly and sell all those but the process of duping and the fact they are carrying around gross amounts of weight is making the servers have a fucking fit every few minutes
---
2 leather 2 cork.  ALWAYS pick them up.
---
And I'm at my camp near green country lodge in the river but I was in my base
---
I have a TSE lever action pm me your offer 
---
Oh? And how exactly would you be storing 100k of steel scrap (weighing 3000 lbs.) on one character without either using the infinite carry weight exploit or making the character so encumbered as to be impractical to ever use? 
---
The very few (if any) players erroneously banned using such a method would be able to appeal the ban a anyways. That tiny fraction of the player base, if such players even existed, would be inconvenienced, but the vast majority of honest players would greatly benefit from such a decisive strike against dupers.
---
That's the kind of attitude why it's not allowed, whether you think he deserves it or not, it's not your duty to go out of your way to hunt them down. 
---
Yeah good point, but where is the mouth harp?  That thing is in game and I can't even build it.
---
If its the one I'm thinking of its just Plan:Desks  I got it for defending someone workshop i was passing by when the event started. Otherwise check inside the little shacks that are part of the substations, camp plans can spawn on the workbench/desks in there.
---
&gt;But considering its another week its worth asking again. Can we please, please get some communication from you lads. It would be really nice if we could if its not too much to ask.
---
Seriously. We just nuked WS &amp; the Queen in one session and it was a fucking nightmare. No we didn't do both at the same time. Loot not loading for up to 5 minutes or more, enemies teleporting, SBQ stuck in the air motionless then stuck on the ground barely able to move, then disconnect after disconnect after disconnect, I am not sure why we are still playing this game 
---
Are you asking about a TSE Handmade rifle, the handmade plan or just a regular non-legendary weapon? 
---
Hear hear! Glad some others are getting some wholesome fun out of this game.
---
But there is tho.
---
Well I've got a lvl 50 super sledge with lightweight legendary perk so it only weights like 2 lbs, 155 dmg with the rocket mod,  really cool
---
First, I doubt they said that. If the game knows what's in your inventory, the devs sure as hell can find out too.
---
What they probably said was something along the lines of that they can't track the *source* of items in players' inventories. Big difference.
---
Yeah it's the Union soldier uniform, don't remember where I got it but you can find it around
---
Yeah I heard some people getting an email and then atoms, but at this point I feel like their ignoring the tickets about the bags and atoms, since other tickets they respond almost in a day or two.
---
If one or more people from the original nuke remain in the area they can be respawned as the glowing variants..
---
That said, We think Bethesda nerfed the spawns, I've not seen a 2*+ drop after the nuke blast clears..
---
Wow. I craft boards using super duper to scrap for rubber, basically converting my wood into rubber to craft marine and trapper armor since I don't know all their mods and I always need rubber. Never had more than 150 in one crafting session but damn... knowing this now, I'll avoid those numbers. I just turn all my raw materials into other things while I wait for respawns or events, grinding out XP and lowering my carry weight.
---
The workaround is also patchable. If they just used these as temporary fixes to stop further abuse. Also they could just be waiting because they have some way to track this stuff now and are just waiting to pull the trigger on all of the cheaters.
---
That's not a huge query on any modern relational database engines.
---
Because we still hope for the best with 76 and see great potential don't feel bad for feeling it.
---
i like these :)  well played.
---
Ran into it tonight on PS4 but in silo bravo.  Repaired the damaged mainframe cores and all of them disappeared from my inventory.  Burned through 4 fusion cores finding other mainframe cores to use.  If I didn’t use them right away, they also disappeared.  Cherry on the cake - ran out of fusion cores as I was fighting the queen.  Had to leave the blast zone as I couldn’t move and just kept dying.  Such a freaking joke.  
---
What? Im confused, u just go to the targeting system then. 
---
Well one died and claimed I took al their junk. But yes it’s stupid and if there wasn’t multiple of them I’d have axed one in the head.
---
&gt;and makes videos to remain relevant..
---
Is that what hate quantifies to these days?
---
Negative, but we figured it out 
---
You sound almost as if you are describing me and my son. We played through all of the Borderlands franchise sitting side by side the couch. I was hoping for more of that type of thing since we are both Fallout fans, but this game has not really caught his interest. I hope I can get him to jump in again soon now that its is a more stable and less buggy experience. 
---
Agreed, it’s going to take a long time and tons of money on 76 before the engine can really pull off a co-op at least resembling what people want.
---
We should harass people because they slowed a video game down.
---
What benefit does Grafton steel give you? I understand the Munitions and the landfill, but steel is everywhere. 
---
But Bethesda doesn’t really care about this game. This should have been the most ambitious Fallout title to date, and they dumped it on their ATX studio, who don’t have much of a history with the engine. A game studio, I might add, that selectively sought out developers with experience in microtransaction games during their hiring process. 
---
And before someone points fingers saying I’m just being negative: I’m level 77, been playing this game since launch, and I’ve been having a blast with it. It genuinely a fun game, when it works (Like most Bethesda games). But the game reeks of an easy cash grab, and I think a lot of what we’ve gotten in terms of patches and communication thus far is just backpedaling by the company to try and mitigate loss. I don’t think they expected this game to be as big as it was. 
---
Although it is unfair if they only win the workshop because they are using a duped super weapin
---
Slide in that GT so people know who to look out for.
---
And with the right perk (chemist?  I forget the name), you can turn 1 stimpak plus 2 purified water into 4 diluted stimpaks. With super duper perk you could get even more. So you eventually get the ability to double (or more) your healing ability by breaking down stimpaks. 
---
Then mix in some perks to boost the healing effects, and you should be good :). I turned 50 stimpaks into 200 diluted, and sold to vendors. Still have about 100 regular stimpaks from scrounging and various mini events. :)
---
nope. when I get disconnect from server, the workshop is gone.
---
Did they change that? I use to nuke everyday one code a week for one site, all i needed was a key card and went straight to the targeting system
---
LOLOLOL Bethesda doesn't even answer tickets anymore, at least not for anyone I know nor myself
---
Honestly on this sub everyone downvotes valid criticisms and bug reports.. for some reason.
---
And everyone hates Juicehead because...? He makes videos showing off Fallout 76? The buggy mess that it is.
---
No. We’re not going to harass people for slowing down a fucking video game.
---
There were for us but they were pretty rare compared to the normal legendary 
---
Nah lets not harass people for slowing a game.
---
In my head Canon the scorched are normal humans but we were exposed to hallucinagens and mind control to believe that they're scorched.
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks mate! 
---
Can you show us those bugs instead of just making shit up?
---
Also we need to be on the look out for dupers. You see a very high level player and a very low player together huddled around a workbench, go ask them what they are up to
---
Did they drop more than 1* legendary items?
---
They get used when you craft. Never run your steel down below a certain threshold or this happens unfortunately
---
it's a scorchbeast nest 
---
People on here want to fix the game and you guys are downvoting them for reporting on bugs.
---
Yeah lets go harass people over a video game.
---
Someone said a while ago that mods are used up when you dont have the right mats when you build, etc. It breaks them down. 
---
I had 18 mutations and landed Herbivore instead of Carnivore. I ended up deleting 16 mutations before i finally got rid of Herbivore. May the RNG Jesus be in you favor.
---
No problemo my elquinno
---
Yeah harassment!
---
There is not.
---
Dude this is awesome!!
---
Maybe Bethesda should fix this exploit to avoid this happening.
---
Yes this is correct
---
&gt; Remember the reason as to our stash limits is server stability.
---
This has been posted and reposted millions of times and I have yet to see any actual source for this, other than a bunch of conjecture.
---
Yeah, I've noticed redditors can be a bit single minded. Don't like what they say in one post? Downvote everything the have to say no matter what!
---
I swear I reference this movie more than I should. Nobody ever gets it though. I thank you for proving I'm not alone!
---
Some games seem to have but devs were able to patch them quickly. D3 had it for a while. Someone described an MMO having it for a bit.
---
Other comments in this thread can give better anecdotes, or maybe it was the other thread on the front page. They’re all bluring together for me tonight.
---
SWING THE BAN HAMMER WHAT?! Maybe they should fix the fucking bug.
---
No. No harassment.
---
Holy shit, why would they make it like that?!
---
Ride to Hell Retribution had potential...
---
Yep, someone was duping.
---
Dude everyone is pressing the big blue arrows.
---
Not sure, but it sucks
---
My boyfriend was so excited for this game, and i got it for him as a surprise. He is so sad now about how it turned out. Now i see why. Such a letdown
---
Farming in this game can be done incredibly efficiently; it’s very easy to streamline your routes and get the most out of it.
---
It just seems to irritate the majority of the players on this subreddit who seem to be in the 100+ hours camp but are still Level 30 — there was a thread a few days ago of guys kinda trying to one-up each other by showing how many hours they had played and how low level they were, high-fiving each other, and telling others who are farming why they’re playing the game wrong. It’s been a trend since this subreddit’s assumption since it’s inception anyways.
---
What frustrates me to no end, however, is how quick people on thos subreddit are ready to jump at the throat of other customers for this game’s issues instead of Bethesda. This thread would have gotten my upvote if it was “Hey, Bethesda, dupers such but *you’re* really the problem.”
---
Instead it’s the complete opposite. And it made me really angry people were downvoting and mad at you for having a fucking mule without being aware of what a mule even does.
---
Can you show examples?
---
Its on x box, it’s beginning to be a issue. Players putting their camp right at the clubhouse and killing everything in the area including players. I guess it is the new way to effortlessly level up.
---
Having more than one piece of armor with cloaking or the cloaking mutation is not necessary.  
---
Cloaking adds to your overall stealth as does your armor weight, perks and other things.
---
my jaw dropped when i logged in and saw 100+ after the beta period.
---
still at level 44 til now... 
---
Have you heard of mules ? My mule has over 6000 weight on it currently after I last purged crap legendaries
---
Bobbleheads stack on each other, take 500 of the same one and kill the queen in like 2 shots I've seen done
---
Don’t trade at all. Fixed.
---
I think when people pay 60 bucks or more for a game they will play it exactly as they want.  Dont think you can do much to change that 
---
Actually wondering this myself once you tame it do you keep it even w/ server hops and the like?
---
These are some really cool places. I had my camp set up just right of birdwatchers post. There’s a pretty flat spot right upon those mountains with a couple of tents on the ridge. Very secluded, never had a single mod attack my camp and there’s a copper deposit right on it. 
---
Intentionally, or not it will still crash the server. So they're still wrong as well
---
Thank you.
---
Bethesda: I can’t hear you over the shitty micro-transactions.
---
Wish my dad was alive 
---
Exploits aren’t cheats. Cheats are hacking.
---
I've been a fan since the original fallout and I have this game a fair shot. I'll come back to it again if everything gets fixed. 
---
A rating system that might as well be ignored
---
Obtaining L50 can be achieved within a short time if desired - but why rush to endgame? There are more pressing issues at hand, like stability, glitches and cheating.
---
Hehe. What a wanker
---
you go girl
---
The farm near flatwoods, where you finish the mr farmhands event. There’s bag of cement in the greenhouses and the sheds to the front of the building. 
---
Done patrol duty 4 times now.  My friend got 10mm plans which I was kind of surprised I didn't have.  And I have gotten plasma gun all four times and that event is RARE 
---
Lol i hear the sound of artillery
---
Mayors office in watoga after quest. Gives 8 every time
---
It’s okay to love this game. You just have to admit it’s bad. 
---
Resistance 2 is a bad game but I love it.
---
I heavily disagree with Warframe's economy being robust, everyone's there to scam you
---
I’m confused.  Are you saying you prefer a ported upgrade, like the HD Skyrim for example, over a 3rd party completely redoing a game from the ground up?
---
Sucks that you cant defend yourself, you might need to change your build
---
I don’t have a walker yet. I ride a Harley Davidson Electra Glide. Need one in the game.
---
Mods aren't being banned but careful to make sure the mod you install does not give you a edge. Perk loadouts being a edge.
---
I see player interactions instead of NPCs is going exactly how Todd planned 
---
I just scrapped so much good shit....
---
I don't get any crashes
---
You are a legend. I play fo76 with my dad also, and while he isn't as good as me, he knows what to do and the enjoyment we get when we complete a task is incredible. I hope you and your boy have many more successful adventures!
---
I never crash from it, but often miss out on loot because of it. It's so unnecessary
---
Since it's clear the BGS employees are taking some time off for the holiday season I wonder if any of them are actually playing 76 and experiencing the bugs and exploits they've neglected for the past two months like the rest of us.  
---
MINI GAMES AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS!
---
I didn't know how much I needed this until now.
---
I have wandered around there several times in the past 2 days. Robots spawn, but I have only seen legendaries when others were around and all the bots were shooting them. 
---
Spawns right next to the pond that is just East of the Charleston train station, just North of the shack. You can run South over the red bridge and then back to get a spawn. Could be a number of things that spawn but every once in a while you will get the vendor. Sells hunters long coat and clean space suit.
---
to be fair, the "follow me" emote feels more like "shoot me, I dare you"
---
That really sucks. I feel bad for you. I learner the hard way too, but it wasn't anything too valuable. Just a couple of t60 mods.
---
297, no exploits, lots of wandering around murdering the wildlife and occasional grinds of WhiteSpings...
---
And I also goof off allot in game..
---
I added you on Psn
---
Saw the explosions and it crashed me from my server because I wasn't far from it and had to restart my game twice.
---
At least it wasn't Coca-Cola investigating you for drinking illegal substances (Nuka).
---
I can agree with that, seeing a higher level might strike some fear in them, I even have my weapon holstered and it’s like, nope poof, they’re gone.
---
I got you fam 
---
Wait. Is this true? If so... I guess I finally figured out why I kept getting my ass beat by my neighbor when we were 6 in Pokemon battles. He had an entire party of level 100 Charzards 😢 
---
I don’t know about when it dies but when you leave the game and join back it’s still there yeah
---
Since I got a tse I haven't engaged. Feel like either way it'll probably be unbalanced. I mean sure I could blow them away to defend something I barely wanted in the first place but I'd really rather not. 
---
Dude, that is freaking awesome. 
---
We seriously need a „gift“ emote in which the character points downward 
---
THIS!
---
Indeed, couldn’t agree more, like a shaking present emote or something.
---
Yeah https://imgur.com/a/QdQxaNz
---
These have been the best places to find them. But keep in mind you need animal friend and wasteland whisperer to tame them 
---
Except Bethesda implemented the stash and inventory limit completly in favor of dupers and in disfavour of ordinary law abiding citizenz. Stackable materials don't use server resources at all, you barelly keep 100 of each material in your stash and you will be at full stash limit despite them not using more line codes if the stack number was infinite. But then you have dupers who keep 9999 weapons with unique lines of codes on a mule in their character inventory since Bethesda made no limit on the number of weapons you can hold in your inventory. If Bethesda on the other hand made materials infinite and weapons limited then everybody would be happy and server stability improved.
---
Your logic isn’t sound.
---
“You can have this bro, just let me finish building these turrets real quick”
---
Spawned https://imgur.com/a/QdQxaNz at the bottom highlighted part. Level 21 but most of the time it spawned a level 40 just had to keep server hopping 
---
I dont think it crashes the game but if we all use a Tesla Rifle, we can all tag em and loot em. That's what i do, tse shotgun over kill and selfish
---
The train stations in the Southwest are my go-to. I just look at what the mod refines into- if it says black titanium then it's an excavator piece. 
---
Never use your own junk on a workshop.
---
Make that three posts for ya man.
---
Been down this road your on and i make sure that every single time i jump on this sub. That this issue is constantly brought to light. Some of the comments baffle me here. We should not be ok with such a major issue going on since bloody beta. Especially if you want to see this game thrive for years to come.
---
+1 OP i will support your thread with the rest.
---
I once gave my friend a heart attack because i was throwing arty flares at him.
---
I told him they were reloading.
---
His insurance called him hes no longer covered for artillery strikes because its costing them too much money.
---
I do the workshop for the blueprints. After that , I could care less if someone takes it over. 
---
Now that I think about it... every single time I play with a specific friend, I am constantly getting “server has stopped responding” messages. On top of that, there is additional shady behavior I have seen, but haven’t been able to put clues together. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was duping, and if he is, it will be really disappointing not playing with him anymore. 
---
I just got one! You can find tameable deathclaws in these areas https://imgur.com/a/QdQxaNz
---
Salisbury is a lie. There is only Insta-Mash.
---
Through Insta-Mash I gain Strength.
---
Through Strength I gain Power.
---
Through Power I gain Victory.
---
Through Victory my chains are broken.
---
The Force shall set me free. 
---
They're stacked so they're all the same level and condition, not like looted boards.
---
I think that's why they have 1045568 bulk wood instead of 1048576 (power of 2), crafting boards for experience. The difference would make 6016 level 45 boards so they might alternated between crafting and scrapping.
---
Did you ever find one? The Charleston station vendor bot, that occasionally spawns, sells it.
---
[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/abuse/](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/abuse/)
---
Late response but I’m not expecting anyone not to get mad. I’m telling people that you can’t expect people not to abuse this. I really hope Bethesda punish these people hard. 
---
After two years this video is still up, so I think it’s safe to use it

---
Imagine being such a loser you can't be good in this game without duping.
---
Until you log out. They'll be neutral again when you log in.
---
I've always just server hopped which fixes it
---
Well, if he’s duping he’s literally making the game unplayable for you and everyone else. Tell him what duping is doing but don’t accuse him and see how he reacts would be my advice. As for what to do based on how he reacts, that’s ultimately up to you.
---
Why do you want the grafton steel or Charleston landfill? There aren't rare ressource in there. 
---
Bloodied, +40% swing speed, + strength
---
Bethesda: 
---
&gt;*releases a new batch of ATOM store items*
---
There not programed to forgive
---
Ah there you go. Hadn't seen that article or heard about that, assumed it was the essay length posts about stealing from dupers. 
---
I’m not sure what the current meta is, but I think.... instigating, swing speed and +1 strength? Maybe?
---
Wait omg this is a really cute random encounter
---
don't remember exactly, there's not a lot but it should be about 8 plants iirc? They are a bit spread out however.
---
A common mistake is thinking that the Perk Card you choose is where your SPECIAL point goes. 
---
It’s not. 
---
The first screen you see after hitting the “level up” button, is the SPECIAL screen. This is where you select the attribute to put the point into.
---
The next screen is the Perk Card selection. It is important to note that you do not have to pick a Perk Card from the same SPECIAL that you just put a point into...for example, you can put a point into ‘Strength’, and still pick a card from any other SPECIAL.
---
The decisions are not locked in until you’ve confirmed the Perk Card that you’re taking, so you can back out and change the choice from the first screen if you wish (tip: you can even back out past that first screen to view your current levels/cards before making a decision). 
---
Hope that helps!
---
It's in fort defiance
---
I use the heart emote and thumbs up and some people get it sometimes but a gift emote would be perfect
---
lead steel and copper all in the same area, all are used heavily for ammo.
---
Thats it! your all under investigation, my dad owns Microsoft! Lmao
---
Yep i support the hell out of the idea Dom and you are far from alone. All over people on the sub are losing their minds with these wankers.
---
I had a similar run in with someone who had 1000s and 1000s of everything. I work my ass off to stock my store it takes me ages to grind out good items for it. On a good day i might move a few items and make 3200 + caps.
---
These assholes devalue the entire network and some sell for real money (another issue)...
---
Look i don't want to start venting but last time i vented here i ended up creating a rally point.
---
I added your thread to it.
---
Not a girl gamer, but I'd love to join too! This is my literal exact play style and I've been thinking about experiencing the multiplayer aspect of the game.
---
Yes but I have one indisputable fact for you; the employees of this game are lazy and really they just don’t give a shit. It’s just a job for them meeting their daily quota checking marks on a list of what to do
---
I wonder if it’s just my client disconnection or the whole server crash..
---
Either way ppl trying to make a quick buck are basically killing any kind of stable server status I haven't been able to stay logged in for more then 10-20m for over a week because of server crashes
---
Kinda bad because dragons are still alright to fight. These things a waste of time. Only ok if you get them cheaty one shot guns.
---
Don't blame you.~singsongs~ Every time I crash, I get this feeling. Every time I start to hate mah life! ~stops~ 
---
If you haven't gotten rid of it though, at the very least give it a lick when they finally release the first DLC... who knows, maybe it'll be fantastic.... and buggy,and funny... for ALL THE WRONG REASONS :D
---
I have a couple single action ivory grip plans that you could use 
---
Sounds like a very stupid fucking friend who is probably reaping the benefits of the duping as well and deserves to lose everything.
---
I built on Seneca Mountain (I think it's called that?) After being under Watoga highway and finding a house to take over I decided I wanted to get the hell away from anything taking pot shots at my house from 300 metres away.
---
It plays the game right or it gets the hose. 
---
Myself, my friend, and my wife had over a dozen disconnects in a 4-5 hour play session tonight. COULD be due to duping like this (I 100% don't condone it) but either way, Bethesda needs to sort it out because I'm close to 200 hours into this game, level 80 something, and about to quit if the stability doesn't improve. I love Fallout but the instability is ridiculous. I'm not even going to  mention how many random glitches I had during the session...
---
/r/FO76 has literally never heard of a ban wave is what I got from this thread.
---
Do you already have the broken uplink in your Misc? If so, you need to take the broken uplink to Rose.
---
I had about 200 tato plants, yes i also had this
---
It's not far enough fuck dupers and exp exploiters. I am gonna enjoy every single reddit thread that pops up after the ban hammer.
---
Might even buy a nice bottle of wine to go with their salty tears. This is comming from soneone who does not even like to pvp because i don't want to hurt others.
---
Take my upvote kind sir
---
Let me guess, you just watched Origin Unknown.
---
The moment you realise Fallout76 is just the mind of Tyler Durden.
---
“The things you own end up owning you. It's only after you lose everything that you're free to do anything.”
---
I know, this is to those people who DO dupe.
---
Pc??
---
I think it’s as simple as this: if you are a hoarder, Excavator is going to be your go-to for junk runs. 
---
Ps4 my bad should of put that on the title
---
What platform are you on?
---
Look, I have lots of sympathy for those people hunched over the screens. I really do. But Bethesda, as a corporate entity, should have planned for this. They literally told us straight up before the launch that it would be one of the rockiest launches they've done. 
---
They should not have released the game in this state at all, really. And when they made the decision to do it anyway they should have set aside resources to deal with the problems they already knew about, at the very least.
---
That could mean paying people extra to work over the holidays, offering extra free time before or after the holidays, or something else that would have worked for the employees while also ensuring that the company fulfilled its part of the deal they made with us when we bought the game.
---
Because that's what it is when you buy something - anything. A deal, an agreement between two parties. Bethesda has not even been close to honoring that agreement, and they need to step up their game like right now. 
---
In fact, according to law (at least where I live) the buying party has a legal right to get a product that meets reasonable expectations according to what is standard within the industry. FO76 has not been, and is still not, even close to what could have been reasonably expected. 
---
I think people should keep being angry until Bethesda makes this right. It is our right as the wronged party of a broken agreement, and it is our moral duty as consumers to do what we can to make sure this kind of thing will not happen again. As it stands right now, Bethesda has basically scammed millions of people. They must not get away with it. 
---
I used to farm steel there. Until I realized I can get more for quicker just scrapping the weapons of the almost infinite number of Muties there + Scrapper.
---
The people brigading are trolls, dupers and exploiters trying to justify why they do what they do and to pretend like they aren’t using exploits.  Just block them and upvote OP 
---
Damn, sry.. good luck! 
---
Do I have to have a playstation to join? I play the game on PC...
---
Thnx
---
When I found this I was wandering if I could send another player flying. Sadly I wasn’t with nobody
---
Ha! me and a buddy at lvl 40 or so was shooting it till it finally died in flight, good 4 mins never landed once. We was melee so are guns was doing normal damage. 
---
O i do also HEY Beagle. :D
---
I will be on tomorrow buddy if ya need a hand with anything.
---
You know it my friend ❤️
---
Nice! Go Dad and Son!
---
Gonna be spending alot of time redoing my camp near the overseer camp to help new players. Currently focused on hunting exploiters and people trolling others.
---
The amount of patience I've given this game regarding server stability was great. But im at the point now where it's unplayable for me. My internet is solid but recently i get kicked from a server regularly enough where i just cant play anymore. So im gonna wait for that shit to get worked out, cause otherwise i was having fun w the game.
---
Did you had your home on mid-east part of map, near the hunting lodges? 
---
I'm not defending players who clearly violate TOS and dupe items with an in-game exploit.  But then again, it wouldn't be such an issue if Bethesda didn't botch the release so badly and proceed to fix nothing.  
---
Crashing the server to duplicate items *does* violate the TOS doesn't it?  Please tell me bethesda didn't manage to forget to add an appropriate clause and screw up the TOS as well.  It would be kind of funny though.  
---
You could argue that using mules isn’t playing the game as intended. Should that be a bannable offence is quite a grey area as it’s common practice to have “alts” so sorting genuine from mules would be complicated. 
---
If the ban hammer comes down they’ll be whining posts on here in seconds “Bethesda took mah loot waaaa”. An in game character isn’t meant to have thousands of lbs worth of junk. I’m level 21 and I’ve got 570lb In my stash and 130lb on me. 
---
You may want to consider moving anything of value across to your main character if you have a high weighted mule because I can see those getting banned or the items removed. 
---
Really seems like they don't play their game doesn't it? been thinking that on a lot of stuff I run into.
---
Try to eat food to relieve Hunger before drinking to relieve Thirst.  For some reason, the penalty meters and disease % chances hit you much harder if you drink when starving, than if you eat when thirsty.
---
Does this duping still work? I only had duping of CAMP items when moving it but without server crash with budget limit still working- ie can’t build anything more.
---
What?
---
Anyone focusing on the hysterical make believe cases that would result from mass bans of dupers and exploiters is themselves a duper and exploiter.  They are concern trolling.
---
Churned butter once or twice ; living in an Amish paradise 
---
I really enjoy the workshop PvP but I do wish there was something to prevent a squabble from becoming a 2hr battle of attrition. 
---
Today my team wrecked a group of attackers 20 times over but they were so determined(or more likely tilted) that it just never ended. The winner has nothing to do with K/D but rather who's more stubborn 
---
I was told the region of the codes didn't matter. I preordered an EU code and used it with no problem in Australia
---
Get farther into the story. You will understand why there is no NPCs.
---
I checked at level 30 and just see a harpoon gun plan (no hopping).
---
Every time I play Skyrim I have to stop gaining XP at level 11 until I can find a vendor with Muffled Boots. At later levels they become astronomically rare.
---
Well that was a hell of a run
---
Which part?
---
I found that!  You can't launch yourself off the cliff though...  don't ask me how I know.  *whistles innocently*
---
What is /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ going to do about these assholes?
---
Actually not sure if they can ban from a legal perspective. I remember there being some EU thing about not being able to block access to content paid for... most games have some single player  or manual multiplayer aspect included that allows for banning of the matchmaking multiplayer aspect. This game doesn't have that, and even if they add it in now, it wasn't part of the original product so I'm not sure it would count. 
---
All of that said, they could wipe their progress. 
---
Is the black ice a unique fire axe?
---
You can get nuke code pieces as loot from scorched officers. It's not a bug, it's just what they carry regardless of what quests you have
---
You look like an old timey mountain climber. Perfect attire for such a climb. Now do the monorail elevator.
---
When you gonna do it?
---
My understanding is once a set is claimed ; it can’t be stolen. 
---
Would they have the capacity to search where the loot was obtained? I’m sure duping “looks” odd on a report somewhere? Also I wouldn’t want 10000 of something as I wouldn’t have anywhere to put it!! 
---
I’m not sure how to do it and don’t want to look but if it works like in Oblivion the inventory would read 10:21am 1x Shotgun and then 10:22am 500x Shotguns? 
---
Then cross reference that against how the loot was acquired, e.g. item pick up, quest item, item trade, vendor, death bag, dropped bag etc. 
---
Here in like 10 mins we're in the silo
---
Implying that this game hasn’t been abandoned by the devs.
---
A subtle soulful cash grab should be OK.
---
I completely closed my store man Jokers Bargains is no more. The market is pretty messed up and Bethesda has still not done darn thing about them.
---
So now i focus my time helping people under 50 and making dupers lives as annoying as possible as well as take their dupes and dump them. Its not an easy thing to do.
---
I almost gave up on 76 when i closed my store. But i refuse to let these wankers win. Mind you would be super helpful if Bethesda atleast said something as to deter some people from doing it.
---
Sure, it's ALL the YouTubers fault. Of course, it's not like Bethesda released an unfinished, buggy game lied about the Canvas bag, leaked private data or tried to sell a crappy product for $88 now is it? 
---
This is how it works. You need to spend 29 perk points to unlock level 30 perks for example. It's how it has always worked
---
Well that sucks 
---
Also for some reason it’ll prioritize scrapping mods over using bulk. 
---
Limb damage doesn't affect scorch beasts landing, they just do it whenever they want.  It might seem like the limb you're pounding leads it to land but it was just set to land anyways, there are no mechanics to fighting a scorchbeast
---
The jealousy is real. Not my problem your shitty WalMart PC or xbox one can't handle the game. Just leave us dupers alone, thanks!
---
Feels retro
---
Taking someone's dropped junk is a legit game mechanic.
---
no
---
Mules have been a staple of MMOs since MMOs existed, any game designer making a game of this nature who doesn't expect people to mule has done it wrong.
---
Looking at this site, you could feasibly argue Fallout 76 fans aren't either. 
---
You've done it wrong a thousand times then. I've killed 4 Scorchbeasts in a single fight by VATS targeting the left and right wings with Concentrated Fire 1 and Enforcer 3. After a handful of hits and a few seconds later, they land. Every time. Take out their legs at that point and they go completely dormant.
---
K, add me. I'll join now. Psn bryangolley

Wait seriously? I thought that was just where you start viewing the perks at. This whole time I thought points were supposed to be added when you chose the perk.
---
That's an absolutely asinine design. There's no indication given that you're putting points in at that screen at all.
---
Oh
---
Let me just make this trade and ill join my friend hes in the silo
---
In Fallout 4, when you put away gun, a "pet" become hostile. Does in 76 the same?
---
They probably never considered people doing it. 
---
It stays in your journal as "follow the overseer's journey" or whatever even after you've finished it. Finished the part of it we have access to so far I should say
---
Top of the world Next!
---
I'm having a hard time putting it down tbh, even though I've rinsed all the content.
---
Huh, I tried putting both codes in and none worked. I have some EU buddies I'm waiting to hop on to see if they can redeem it for us. If it still doesn't work they were probably used already and we just got our hopes up for nothing haha
---
Pretty sure it’s explained as much at the beginning, but it’s easy to miss...a lot of people have made this mistake. 
---
As for the design, I agree that it would save a lot of grief if there was some sort of animation to go along with the selection.
---
Funny thing - there’s no Bethesda Replied tag
---
I looted a 3* Marine Unyielding, but its meh. How'd you do?
---
For real some fagots three grenades at mine and knew I would fight back mine is on the side of a cliff near the spruce knob however I just sniped them when I was in the high ground and couldn't find me but its still a waste of mats and shit
---
This !
---
Every time I go play my PS4 I pop in 76,but I just can't get in a server to play
---
I finished the nuke launching mission and that didn’t even help. 
---
Same here
---
Woah sorry man
---
That's why it's not being shared
---
I tried to give a player a bunch of stuff, dropped a bag and everything, but he asked to trade, obviously not understanding.  Trading takes way too long for my taste.  I would rather drop stuff and maybe, if you want to, give something back like a few caps or maybe some plans that you have extra copies of (I just might not have one or two of them).
---
Had a hard time putting it down. Depends what you want to get out of it. I wanted to just explore and craft, so it's perfect for me. I was drawn right in. 
---
i have done similar for friends most are usually low level and get attacked by other low levels then here i come a level 30 with a heavy puncturing rocket sledgehammer  that can 2 shot them.
---
Forgive me for saying this,
---
But this is just stupid. 
---
This is ABSOLUTELY  something that should have been explained in the game.
---
I'm talking to you Bethesda.
---
Enough said.
---
What platform. I like free stuff
---
I remember on launch day people were having trouble with valud codes being applied. I can't remember the circumstances, but might be worth googling
---
Philippi Cemetary and Pickett fort have them. They sell quite well to traders so they may have been pillaged but you find them quite frequently I wore one from 15-25 ish until I found my current digital camo outfit.
---
They make a slick sniper outfit if matched to a black cowboy hat or even a military cap. 
---
Right know I want to finish collect power armor part and kill shit
---
:-( was gonna give you the outfit but I'm ps4
---
Think what you will, it's not how it works
---
So how am i able to get these games if i played console? But i do got a pc thoe.
---
No! They defend your camp it’s really cool!!! 
---
Were you able to come in?
---
They really don’t. 
---
It won't help. Everyone's quests is like this. I'm guessing the quest spans multiple content updates
---
Somebody realized fixed damage increases would be broken, and removed all but one of them, the most broken one of them all
---
I was mainly in it for leveling and got to 48 from like 43 I think so I'm def satisfied. Also got alot to sell and craft with so woohoo
---
Fair enough. Great xp at Whitespring nuke zone that's for sure
---
Is mayonnaise a wind instrument?
---
Join me
---
Appreciate the thought at least, friend
---
Not exact numbers but close. Oblivion 225 quest, fallout 3 59 quest, skyrim over 300, fallout 4 144, fallout 76 120 and to put in perspective one quest is just a robot telling you a bedtime story. All 5 games $60 I'll give fallout 3 a pass new ip for them had to build from scratch. 1000+ hours in oblivion, skyrim and fallout 4 and still haven't done every quest. 300 to 400 in fallout 76 and nothing to do on 2 characters.
---
I enjoy stumbling upon Scorchbeasts. Yesterday there was a triple lvl 80 Scorchbeast attack on a nearby workshop and the owner had given up opting to fast travel away and leave it to it's fate. I thought I'd lend a hand and take them down one by one through crippling their wings in VATS. The owner came back as I finished off the last one, thanked me with thumbs up emotes and I walked away with a bunch of Scorchbeast parts to cook. :)
---
Then who knows it?
---
When you say stuff jumps around randomly, you aren't just sorting by weight are you? When you do, it can switch around items of the same weight
---
Yeah. His friends wouldn't kill him and remove his bounty and keep his loot secure. 
---
I also have x-ray vision and can jump skyscrapers in a single bound.
---
No, sorry. This is a public-facing job and they put out a broken product. Silliness like holidays is out the window at this point. Count yourself lucky if you've never been there, but sometimes your choices are either put in the 60+ hour weeks until it's turned around or get walked out the building. 
---
I can barely clear a group of enemies before the controller message pops up and then it disconnects. Can't enjoy my missions :(
---
I had once given what I thought was a new player, a bunch of stims, water, food, and good low level weapons, and all I got was: “that’s it?, cheap skake” had to honestly grit my teeth on that one.
---
fuck that guy with his duped shit
---
On PC, if you need some super stims I can hook ya up.
---
Thanks for the advice but i just ended up moving it back to where i was before. Still had to change it up tho. Could not get the 3x3 foundation base to place anywhere (wonder how i managed to when i first moved there) 
---
I think I hit G by mistake then Space and scrapped both guns, what a bummer, don't game while tired :(
---
The patrol event at the prison got me mine after 5-6 runs I think
---
We could do a canned food drive through the responders in Flatwoods. Now THAT would be truly “feeding the people” 
---
Why is there no max?
---
There is. VATS targeting the wings with limb cripple perks causes them to land. Crippling their limbs at that point causes them to go dormant long enough to finish them off easily.
---
Xb1
---
Which would be EVERYONE. I don't dupe but have had items in my inventory increase with use instead of decrease (purified water).  I've had items in my workbench increase randomly. I've had Stimpacks in my inventory after I've given them away.
---
I'm certain this has happened to everyone even if they haven't noticed of been intentional.
---
Now because of a poor game mechanic I need my IP banned and not be able to buy any Bethesda product?
---
Yeah. No. 
---
It's not bullying, if you join a workshop the likelihood is that you'll be attacked
---
On Xbox will give you mine 
---
I'd add vampiric and +heavy atk dmg, at least what people will pay/trade for.  I like 40% swing speed vampiric +STR after trying em all.
---
There are an embarrassing number of bugs and issues with this game but I absolutely love it and the world they created. Sometimes when I spend multiple hours building up workshops and powering up Nuclear reactors just to be booted off randomly it feels like an abusive relationship but, much like an abusive relationship, I keep coming back for more. 
---
It’s easy to get in to it, but then you hit the buffers with nothing left to do
---
Nah, when you're scrapping things will switch places even without sorting.
---
I've lost a few items to it. They'll jump from somewhere else on the list.
---
GT:Lowprofile737 not online right now, but at some point tomorrow I can give you the stuff. 
---
Super duper has a chance to double craft serums, chemist not sadly.
---
Yesterday I was helping out this trio of level 3-9s and this guy came along to flatwoods to attack us. After fighting him off a couple of times, he approached us with his weapon away and waved a few times and after a bit of sign language we decided we were all cool. I gave him a fusion core and he hung around with the team for a couple of hours helping us with events and our crusade for aluminium. It was like having a 5 person team!
---
Works regularily for me too,even today. Did you have another PA in the area when you tried to work on the PA station?
---
That happened to me once, I had a set a PA a bit away from my station, and set another frame right inside the station and went to work on it, it pulled the other suit from over yonder and wouldnt let me recall or work on the suit in the frame.
---
Logging out and back in again solved the problem.
---
Some players might make it hard, but thats not the norm for this scenario. The normal PvP players is someone with a TSE that just comes in and one shots
---
Thats not going from easy to hard, thats going from winnin by nap to terminal cancer in the time it takes to pull a trigger.
---
I've had troubles just being on a server for 5 minutes before I get disconnected. Alot of server hopping, not really helping :(
---
I thought I was the only one that had PA peices unequip themselves.
---
They only go up to lv 45 but if you are on xbox then i can get you the plans
---
Trading them for endgame weapons, fast travel, buying mats for armor and weapon upkeep when needed
---
Carrying an Endangerol syringer will help cut back the noob effect a bit.  Ref lvl 240
---
Whaat. I got so much bulk....
---
That sucks. Haven't had this happen yet fortunately. Shouldn't be any way for things to move if they're being sorted alphabetically.
---
So at some point, pretty meaningless?
---
Madigan is dead, and he is what leads you to rose. After you do roses quests you do Abbie’s quests, after that it’s BOS, then enclave.
---
I’ve had the jump screw me before and I randomly started yelling noooooo in the party I was In
---
Dude.. exactly this. Anyone who plays the game at all seriously wont be able to avoid it
---
 It's baffeling. Like catching dupers in the act is easy. How about they hire someone for minimum wage to do that. I would almost be willing to pay that salary.
---
My favorite are the bears giving each other a bath in the mansion to the south. Hornwill Estate or such. 
---
Junk junk junk steel and steel
---
It’s best to only bulk what you’re going to sell or trade. Bulking isn’t going to save any real weight out side of aluminum and lead. Always bulk those two. If you want to bulk everything then just leave the steel at loose scrap and save the heart ache. Lost 2 x01 shocks and jet pack before I knew better. 
---
&gt; I enjoy stumbling upon Scorchbeasts. 
---
I like fighting them too, just annoying when there are 3 or more and they have the rapid fire bug.
---
Do you mean outfits? If so, the vendor bot that spawns near Charleston sells clean spacesuit and hunters long coat
---
Thank you! I got frustrated and just switched back to the first version but perhaps it was just a one time thing. I suppose I was just a bit on-edge because that had never happened to me before and because I had just escaped from the vanishing scorched lol. There are times when I have so much fun on this game and others when I just throw my hands in the air. Thank you for your kind response. I really appreciate it.
---
legendaries take a lot of materials to repair and break pretty fast so getting materials is still as important as earlier. buying and selling high level multi star legendaries is also something high level players do a lot
---
Wooaah, oh no. Those mods are really hard to come by. Sorry that happened to you. Cheers for info re bulking too, ill keep that in mind.
---
You see a typewriter irl and want to scrap it for gears 
---
 I didn't mean it as like, liking the game I meant is as loading into the game
---
Honestly, kind of. 
---
Part of it for me is the bugs. I’ve had a lot of trouble completing quests due to various glitches, so the main quest line is largely unplayable for me so far. Smaller quests glitch a lot for me too, I’ll frequently get dumped from my server as I complete an event or something. Nothing sucks as much as spending an hour powering up a power plant and then just getting thrown out before you can get rewarded.
---
I’ve always cared more about world exploration in Fallout than quests or characters honestly, so the lack of NPC’s was a fine trade off for the biggest world that Fallout’s had so far- but honestly, the moment to moment gameplay of the game sucks in a lot of ways. One of the most fun parts of exploration is collecting various trophies and such for your troubles. But the build size is so limited that you can’t really hold on to anything you keep, and you can’t really sell anything either due to how weird the economy is. So you’re mostly exploring just for explorations sake, which is fun for awhile, but tends to feel aimless.
---
Speaking of the economy, it’s made it very hard for me to feel competent in the game honestly. Getting the proper amount of supplies is a real bitch. You can’t rely on buy-trade, so I’m foraging/crafting for everything I need, which just feels like a chore.
---
The combat feels somewhat broken to me. Enemies either spawn in groups way out of my league, meaning I just die over and over, or are a complete joke and I can wade through them no diff. And while there are probably more new things to fight than any other fallout game, it feels like 90% of encounters are just scorched.
---
I dunno. I love Fallout, but that’s the only thing that keeps me in this game. The sense of obligation I have to play it due to it being under a title I like.
---
Bad frasing of words there on my part
---
Lol yeah they are. It’s all good, some lessons are learned the hard way🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Ya i built my camp near a good source of water and my camp got attacked by scorchbeasts 70% of the time, one time, it was two scorchbeasts attacking my camp, i moved from that spot and havent been attacked by one since
---
Thank you. Glad to know caps don't lose their value later on.
---
Having bugged purified water and carrying 5000 serums aren't the same occurrence you daft twit, you even have to actively lag a server to get it to dupe your items. 
---
The PC economy isn't ruined at all, in fact it's pretty fun, but i'm not sure about consoles.
---
Hmm, I am on PC and recently I have some enemy's die, I get a flash of what they are carrying as  they fall (I am melee build) but once on the floor they are empty.
---
There isn't. I sometimes try to update some of the articles but I'm not a native English speaker, so a full article takes a bit of my time.
---
There's always stuff you need. Ammo and mats if nothing else. Anything that can be farmed can be bought from players.
---
Ahhh yes that one, thank you alot! Does it spawn somewhere near Charleston randomly or?
---
Not my video but my method for crippling Scorchbeasts is the same:
---
https://youtu.be/ZEU2WKAy1yg
---
You dare speak this madness in the house of the great Sugar Bomb God?
---
Yep he's bang on, and some items you can't even buy with caps... you nay have to buy several other 10k+ items just to trade for a single truly ultimate weapon setup.  Armor gets worse.
---
I'm a bit out of the loop and stopped playing this game cuz it fucking sucks so I don't understand what's going on here or why would someone would do this. 
---
And that’s fine.  When a group sends a “wanted” friend in while blocking those who are holding the workshop as a distraction then TSE’ing them from range it’s not really “part of the game” anymore,  it’s abusing a system meant to reduce griefing.
---
Turning an anti-griefing tool into a weapon to aid griefers.
---
If you can’t take a workshop without tricks then you’re a shit player.
---
Omg
---
Sorry, in no way can you repair a weapon and proc a whole other weapon.  It would end up very broken!
---
I didnt pay 60 dollars for someone else to *not even play the game*.
---
Take away the grind from a looter game kills the incentive. Add to that it kills the economy, and the fact that duping pretty consistently crashes servers, I'd hope dupers get met with a hefty ban. 
---
It only gives me duplicates on items I craft.  
---
Damn, I found one and had no idea!
---
It looked like a saucer to me and half-expected aliens to attack me lol
---
I'm a bit out of the loop and stopped playing this game cuz it fucking sucks so I don't understand what's going on here or why someone would do this.
---
Yeah they do I repaired a power armour leg without the perk for it to be over 100 percent and it made it 200 percent repair because super duper kicked in
---
I liek corn soup
---
The silo holotape tells you if a silo is available for launch prep. And if not how long before it opens. It closes for 2 hrs i think after a launch to rebuild the missle. It's handy. my time for reconstruction may be off.
---
Getting a gourd and being able to grow gourds are completely different propositions. 8-)
---
I like it similar but better to an idea I had. I just want a hub town with several unique npc's 15 or so with awesome dialogue
---
Orrrr Bethesda could make a chat system
---
Because Bethesda has never playtested that shit.
---
Not one damn time.  The fact that these weapons are possible is proof of this.
---
A guy on this thread has better info than I do on how to spawn him:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad3tsb/vendor_bot_i_see_everyone_writing_about/
---
Haha I guess not =P
---
And people still have the guts to complain about who complains? Ha ha ha! 😳😑😶
---
Great nowy current base is never going to spawn. The view from that cliff is epic though. 
---
If you go to watoga high school and do the event there, you will get some decent xp and some heavy combat armor which has a chance to be legendary
---
Oh, this is a quote from Oppenheimer, one of the creators of the atomic bomb, after seeing the bomb tested.
---
If you write this quote on YouTube, you can find Oppenheimer saying it on a recorded video.
---
He cited it from the Bhagavad Gita, a text written in Sanskrit. The translation he chose when citing the passage is “I am become”, but other translators have translated the text to English in a different way.
---
It’s just this translation chose to be faithful to the original text by not being grammatically correct in the English language.
---
I’ve seen two TSE users fight.
---
It was literally them charging one another over and over again getting simultaneous kills.
---
It was idiotic.   TSE weapons shouldn’t exist.
---
Again thank you alot Sir!
---
Not to mention they can do it when the servers are down for maintenance, with the dupers logging in to their ban, or level 1 with a first and final warning
---
This is so cringy, but hey you showed them 
---
Tried to offer a low level a full set of lead lined deep pocketed leather Armor, a rifle and a few stims. He ran away and I was left with my level 10 equipment, wondering what to do with it.
---
Put it in the first body I found, guess it disappeared.
---
Don’t listen to what anyone says there is no wrong way to play a open world game like this (or any game) can’t wait for the day you launch a nuke and kill a scorch queen I’m rooting for you 
---
Targeting the wings with VATS and a limb crippling perk gets them to land pretty quickly every time. Cripple their limbs once they're on the ground and they go dormant.
---
Not my video but I use the same technique this guy does to cripple them:
---
You're very welcome. Good luck
---
I’m amused how fast it became a soapbox for how good/bad the game was. I thought it was pretty clear what you meant. If it helps, my husband has been having trouble connecting to servers tonight. We normally don’t have problems. 
---
Arial, Papyrus &amp; Comic Sans walk into a bar.  The bartender says, "we don't serve your type around here." 
---
As told by Buddy in Fo4.
---
Same problem any of you fixed this yet eventually my friends loaded back in but I never still naked some time if I get attack a couple pieces of armour appear and sometimes my weapon but that’s it 
---
Usually if no one takes what I try to give, I leave the items on the corpse outside Vault 76, whether it goes to a new player or a random just looking around and sees free loot, I have no idea.
---
Plans also cost a TON. Like 11000 or something for the small letters plan, etc.
---
You realize that farming the scorchbeast queen has a chance to drop serum recipies so you can craft your own? And that players routinely sell serums, even popular ones like marsupial and speed demon, for less than 500 caps each?
---
I have been blind this whole time ! Thanks !
---
I agree. Or make smaller components (screws, springs etc) come from breaking down items more frequently. So many items I have scrapped an item and wondered why there weren’t any screws.
---
Yes I have. On xbox, the first time I placed it was fine first night, next day just touching it crashed game to home screen.  Moving it fixed, not sure why.  Seen plenty installed at other houses n used em fine so no clue regarding why.
---
However, sometimes it’s nice to have those quests and XP/loot from clearing and claiming. I’ve ran out of things to do so claiming workshops has been something I do to level up. On the other hand, it would be nice to keep the structures or something— hate setting up a workshop then losing it all! 
---
This is so nice, Vault-Dad! Thank you for sharing this with us, it’s so heartwarming!
---
And congratulations to you and your son on a mission well done, hope you recovered well from the knee surgery, and you two have many years ahead playing games together like this!
---
Oh my bad, I've never encountered PvP In workshops before.
---
Vendor in the welch train station has them sometimes.
---
No worries, we've all had our moments with the game. Its a real roller coaster of emotions. Making friends in game helps too.
---
Hope to see you around in Appalachia
---
This!!! Im lvl 140 and the amount of times I've seen a low level/new player and thought "Hey! I can lose some carry weight AND be a nice guy! Here! Take these weapons, armor, food and what not!" And they just seem to be scared, do the confused emote and run away is unreal! Guys we aren't gonna hurt you! Besides the PvP is so broken we couldn't even if we wanted too! Unless it's someone with a 2 shot exploding gun and in which case it doesn't matter what level they are the only people that use them are assholes that wouldn't give you stuff anyway!
---
Just make it so you have 1000 pounds in your stash, and you can max carry 1000 pounds or it says “you can’t carry any more!” In addition to speed and jump reduction with constant damage to your legs while you’re above double your over encumbered limit. Also put a weight limit on paper bags, like 500 or something .
---
I have the stimpak not triggering all the time on the one x and pc with controller. It sucks cause I end up taking like 4 more that I need trying to get it to work.
---
Found it hard at first unlike other Fallouts, till I got my CAMP sorted, then a friend started playing.  Then I was playing more than him, so ranking up, exploring, getting more quests.  Then started doing Nukes, made more friends, good times.  Then they started new characters and Chritmas came and so did Santa, bringing them new games.  So now I am deep in and they are playing something else.  I have time to do side quests, help new people and read or listen to things I skidded past.  So keep at it would be my changed viewpoint.
---
That would be a lot easier honestly “Free stuff for lowbies at overseer’s cache!” Instead of hey come here emote.
---
Glad to know i'm not the only one to think it. I did had an SS2 feel. But probably it was unintentional. But there is one thing that i think it was intentional:
---
 The ambient soundtrack (not the radio) that plays on the Atlas Observatory (and other places too which i don't remember) sounds like one of the tracks from SS2 soundtrack. I'm not sure if they always play the same music in the same locations so i might confirm that later.
---
All that running around and fixing stuff in the silos really takes me away from launching nukes. I always feel bored when going through a silo and I'll just give up when I see that there is a Uranium Fever going on...
---
I mean it is okay to do it once, but having to repeat all that tedious process every time is really boring, that is way people exploit silos by going straight to the launch room.
---
Honestly looks like it just landed because it was over open ground, the hit didn't seem to trigger it and then bugged out when it landed.  Even with crippled limbs it would have attacks, ghouls do this too a lot when they get hit by unstable isotope, it just bugs them and they don't move and stay still
---
Joust off 2K19 
---
Killing Scrochbeast Queen can sometimes drop serum recipies that take a single type of stable flux to craft(among other junk) and thats where people sell them so cheap. I myself have electrically charged and grounded from the queen.
---
Dude was praising the game dip shit.
---
Now that’s a raider
---
I would fight both of those dudes bc I'm another girl that plays the exact same way. Stealth is incredible if you grab the right perks.
---
I'm very, very, VERY glad that you're no longer with either of those fools.
---
Why would Bethesda EVER block people from future preorders? That would make zero sense. "Yeah, let's make sure this person who cheated in one game will never be able to buy from us again. That'll sell games!" Do you realize the backlash most of these suggestions would have on the company? 
---
Nah, IF they do anything about this, they'll do it quietly. 
---
Best place is blackwater mine. Go to the small bridge in the mine, water has areas of 40+ rads, and a decom arch at the entrance, less than 100m away from the water.
---
Ikr? Wtf is “database file string”? 
---
When I did Patrol Duty for the first time my reward was Handmade plans, go figure...
---
Hell, if someone wants one of mine, they can have it.
---
Not going to travel back to my workshop and get my shit pushed it when I can just server hop.
---
Luckily it's never been a problem, I've never had a single workshop taken from me yet.
---
And I've never had to take one as during the many hours of playtime it has taken me to get to level 43, I've only ever seen two workshops that were claimed.
---
If it we're an official thing it'd be cool. 
---
Are you guys all good. Do you need help or something?
---
Lots of us are avoiding free stuff and trades, though im sure the effort is always appreciated from non dupers :)
---
What’s a TSE gun?
---
Whichever SPECIAL you click first is where the point will go, however you can then cycle through and pick a card from any of them. So you could pick Strength to level up but then go to Intelligence and pick the Hacker card. The system is confusing at first.
---
Lmao gold
---
I agree but the annoying thing is is that these are empty and  no one pays attention to them, but when you take one suddenly people remember that they exist and suddenly want what they offer. It's annoying that they don't take them until you do. (At least in my humble &lt;10 workshop experience)
---
I have the opposite reaction to Scorchbeasts. Something like, "yay a fight where I don't kill the mob in just one or two shots". I use VATS + a limb cripple perk to target the wings and force them to land. Once on the ground, cripple the limbs to make them go dormant. Pretty much what this guy does:
---
It's not very challenging but it's more entertaining than one shotting almost every other mob in the game and feels good when you get thanks for rescuing another player or their workshop. :)
---
Don't feel bad.  I'm at level 55 just exploring solo and doing the side quests.  I'd like to get to 100 just to round out my perk card set.  I've finally built up my ammo stash a bit so I'll probably do some White Springs runs tomorrow.
---
“Tried to” dupers found a way around it in less than an hour
---
She's bashed hundreds of heads in...when will her blood filled genocide end?!...;_;
---
Pretty sure these have been in use in Asia for a while now. Think the army has some sort of version as well. 
---
The future is now buddy 
---
People are too used to games like RUST and Ark. Where if you just bought the game and start your first expedition, upon seeing a fully kitted out level 100+, you RUN! 
---
Even if it seems like they are nice, you still run. 
---
I give you one advice: collect some caps and buy the outfit you want (this vendor only sells outfits and some wall clock plans) from another player... I grinded alone by myself for over 10 hours, he spawned like 6-7 times in total, never got what I wanted. Then I tried together with a friend, after the vendor spawned one of us would hold the vendor locked and the other one was server hopping in and out of the server, to change the vendors inventory. We changed his inventory 30-35 times – no Hungers Long Coat... I gave up and bought the fucking thing...
---
1 rocket turret and one spotlight. I keep a brahmin pen solely as bait. Helps that the back side of my base is on a river bank.
---
Now i can agree that duping is bad, but what really irks me are the dupers that sell for real money, or for tons of caps. You have thousands of each item and you cant spare a tse handmade?
---
When i am looking to give to new players I watch the map for emerging.  I check their Achievmants and if it's their 1st run through, I find a message works where in game communication doesn't.  It's like 9/10 messaging and 2/10 waving.  It also means I remember them, if I run into them again.
---
Two shot explosive 
---
I wish I had a nice dad like a lot of you do 
---
how are you getting on the same server to give to your alt? =/
---
Yeah I’m sure they use it in Asia. Slowly we’re going to have a Power Armor in real life. The army has so many innovations they definitely have a power armor. 
---
Good. Dude got what he deserved. Thank you for doing gods work!
---
Indeed that is true.
---
A string (a value denoted by string characters) in a database file. Basically what he is saying is that there is a master file that governs all player actions loaded directly into the RAM. When your actions exceed the speed of the file updating itself, you create a queue for every action on that server and it has to wait untill the initial commands are updated to the file. If that is thousand times of spamming X, the server stops updating and the individual events are out of sync with player actions, causing framerate drops. The engine can not handle due to its legacy code from 1998's NetImmerse/GameBryo, when out-of-order execution was not programmed into engines.
---
My playstyle is pretty similar to that. I don’t rely on chems at all (not even stimpaks), I explore a lot, and I love sneaking. Because I’ve been sneaking so much, I discovered how much creatures are actually not so agressive - mongrels and mirurks for example, warn you to leave (without any perks).If you don’t back off, they’re going to attack you. 
---
When I’m playing with me buds I’m always surprised how “agressive” they actually are, as they shoot everything that moves. 
---
For a few weeks I thought it was weird of me to play the game like this, but it’s always cool to see more people go at the game like I do.
---
Here's the secret though. BGS doesn't keep these kinds of logs. People love to speculate that they can track what's been duped or even delete items from inventories, but in reality BGS doesn't have the tools to do this. 
---
Make it so carrying over 1000lbs of weight turns off slap damage mechanic when applied to you and make you take more damage as well because you are carrying enough weight on you to become a living version of Atlas.
---
Sounds like this game where you need to collect stuff to survive isn’t stable enough to be playable 
---
I would love motorcycles, but I keep seeing people say it isn't possible with Creation Engine. That said, I have also thought about irradiated horses, or even robot horses/robotic means of transportation. I would love a faster means of travel that isn't Fast Travel, because Fast Traveling makes you miss so many things.
---
Lol, this made me chuckle. Everyone knows it's an optical illusion. Nukes are born from the soil.
---
Ahhh I just did this and tried to bap the nuke as it emerged from its shell but your image is so much better. Nice!
---
Bring on the fusion cores! 
---
I meant like repairing your weapon for 130%, then Super Duper procs on top of that. Not a repair plus a new item, haha. That would indeed be broken. 
---
Probably by optimizing the game so the system can understand that hundreds of crafted items shouldn't send the server into a logic loop that rectifies it by booting the user, returning all items to inventory, and allowing others in the world space to retrieve them. The last update was a lazy "fix" and it only took an hour before people figured out the work around. 
---
It doesn't seem like a hard problem to fix. Either it's very, very simple or the engine was not capable of multi-purposing as a multi-player game because of faults like these. I'm hoping it's the first.
---
Congratulations on having female genitals

My camp sits along the pond outside the strange manor (I think that’s what’s it’s called). The misters’ camp is just south of Morgantown next to the stream.
---
Woah woah wait 37$? Time to become rich
---
I’d love to, but I’m already carrying too much junk :)
---
He means let him finish the quest to get the rewards  he's not doing it for the workshops resource collection.
---
Mutation isn't worth it seeing as you have to go without any armor besides weightless. I have sneak 2 and chameleon armor most things walk right past me. However most enemies have intelligent ai where they eventually figure out where you are if you shoot while scorchedbeasts will find you even if you're invisible
---
Ouch
---
if you have more than 3 equipped you can move about 2 steps with out uncloaking having all 5 lets you take a shot with uncloaking sometimes too. not sure if the mutation helps this.
---
Being on PC makes it a tad difficult as far as contact is concerned.  I’ve tried heart emote, waving even going as far as inviting to party and or voice chat.  With console I imagine it’s a bit easier with a text message and what not trying to get your point across.
---
Don‘t grind for it. Buy it from someone. I had him spawn like 40 times in total – no Long Coat... the vendor sells it between 880-1100 caps depending on your perks. You should be able to get one here between 2-2.5k caps. No big difference....
---
There is a vending machine somewhere north in the Ash Heap against a shack that sells three treasure maps (sorry, don't remember exactly where, but it wasn't hard to find). Follow those and they will easily get you all the mats and a bunch of other stuff you need to build the excavator power armor.
---
.
---
God I knew that all the scummy answers would be the right ones lmao
---
Perhaps he means to ban them from buying or playing if they already own any other Fallout games or Bethesda games in general that are on Steam. And I think it's a great idea.
---
There has to be a way of automatically weeding out these fools, surely?
---
Anyone who gets filtered out as a 'duper' should be allowed to appeal the process, but how on earth could you justify having that amount of crap? 
---
It's not accurate to say they're crashing servers when they dupe. They have to return to the same server to get the items, so if they crash the server they don't get the dupes. It's in their interest not to crash the server.
---
And the fat man launcher! 
---
you agree to terms of service when you launch the game for the first time. legally this allows bethesda (specifically zenimax in this case) to ban you for breaking the terms of their service, given this is an online multiplayer game.   
---
i wont copypaste the text but there is a rule under section 8 Rules of Conduct that specifically prohibits exploits, glitches, bugs, etc. and requires players that finds them to report them directly to zenimax. at the header of these rules it states they have the right to restrict access to their service for breaking these rules. You agree to these before you launch the game, remember, so they have legal right as long as they have proof of exploitation to remove you from their service.
---
They aren't going to do shit. They already have our money. 
---
I kill a lot of Scorchbeasts and it's the same. VATS crippling their wings gets them to land shortly afterwards. I fought 4 of them in one fight and as I took them out one by one, not one of them landed on their own without me crippling their wings first. I'm not saying that they won't land on their own but if you don't cripple their wings they stay airborne for a long time. A lot of people here frustrated that they shoot tons of ammo or wait a long time for them to land on their own to try to kill them. I never have to wait even as long as one minute. It works. Same method as in that video.
---
Oh I’m happy to hold Bethesda responsible. They need to tune down a whole bunch of weapons and nerf the fuck out of all TSE. The power level people possess is absurd, there should be no way a single player should be able to mow down all the irradiated ghouls in a nuke zone. Bethesda really needs to get its act together, the current end game isn’t sustainable and will ruin any future end game expansion if they leave things as is, it’s better to upset a bunch of people now than more in the future. 
---
I'm pretty sure the scorchbeasts have some kind of special detection that other mobs don't because they see through chameleon.
---
I realized the workshops since they nerfed them are pointless I can farm more of every resource in the game in 2 mins with 2 server jumps than waiting 1hr for 25 or less of the resource.
---
That is genuinely terrifying
---
...I love it.
---
Sounds a lot like "Getting Over It", now in 3D!
---
Wow no one mentioned the crazy cat ladies house with cat bowls you can get a ton right when you spawn at Bolton greens turn around and over the hill you will see the house.
---
I'm sorry, what you are talking about is ridiculous. Even if by some incredible chance what you describe is true; we can't hold out on punishing real dupers just because of your whiny ass. And as u/lidofzejar said they wouldn't do this to someone that has bugged purified water or stimpacks as that is quite different from having 1 000 000 bulk wood and 5500 TSEs.
---
So stop hating on great ideas you whiny bitch
---
2^19
---
It takes less then half hour to do this. Not 4 hours.
---
It’s so frustrating when people don’t look at the bag I drop for them and aim at it... honestly haha. I give stuff away all the time. Then need a gift emote or something 
---
Just watched a guy at lvl 172 somehow killing winterspring bots using a weird glitch that had lasers triggering from somewhere else. The source was literally nin existant as I tried to track it down.
---
The event "Patrol Duty" in the prison can reward you the handmade plans. 
---
I'm required to due to increased demand.
---
Well technically I can put in for leave over that period but then I'd miss out OT pay. Curious that when a stack of new users are known to be coming online they don't have the staff on had to cope.
---
Sounds akin to giving lifeguards the weekend off even though you know you get an influx of swimmers on Boxing day. 
---
Yeah that...That one actually made me tear up a little lol
---
Just want to point out, that even my stealth alt with 30 agility and purely sneak based, where i can stand 3 feet in front of an enemy and not be seen, is still seen 5 miles away by mole rats and then teleported to
---
Well aren't you just special to be able to waste the hours you've spent playing and just do it all again. 
---
First one in should blow the cars.  Then you might not have the problem of crashing I find.  Saw that in a YouTube before I did my first Nuke and it seems to help.
---
I very rarely find a Public Workshop that isn't free on PS4. And those I take over, I defend once and move on. I'm only it in for the rewards (mostly in the hope of a decent plan - no more metal boxes please).
---
There's also the fact that I rarely play for more than 2 hours in a session, so what's the point in fighting to keep them?
---
However, once I pass the end game and am looking for things to do, I might get into some PVP action and seek out claimed workshops to take over.
---
Piss off. 
---
There is a guy who sells all serums for only 100 caps on xbox (the cost of manufacturing them). He is not a duper and is a nice guy. 
---
1000 caps and you should get every mutation you need. 
---
I completely forgot about those letter stickers.... wonder if they take up a lot of budget.
---
I don’t think it’s either. The guy or girl just want to farm legendaries in whitespings and the more turrets the merrier. Bethesda really needs to fix that bug that lets people get legendary drops from turret kills. 
---
I just fast travel away. It's cheaper and they are not worth the trouble at this point.
---
And you have looked through your miscellaneous quests, too?
---
It was a S.T.I.N.G. operation. Smart Targeting and Investigation via Network Geolocation.
---
You can either use a friend to transfer stuff (which is what I do with important things I really dont want to risk losing) or just have a friend sit on a server while you log in and out using them as an anchor.
---
Also, you dont know true fear until you fight radscorpions. Nothing in this game really scared me (except for massive amounts of ghouls in closed spaces like they do in every fallout until i realize they dont hit hard and proceed to mow them down) but radscorpions are horrifying, they hit hard and fast, and can keep up with you while you SPRINT
---
"I Am become dad,  the Creator of good times"
---
Yes and the only quest in there is Kill a wendigo while wearing a clown costume
---
I have the habit of dropping the bag then shooting at it so they notice, perhaps that’s why they run away in fear 99% of the time haha.
---
Nah. I'm going to continue to judge Bethesda for repugnant, exploitative mechanisms in their full price titles.   
---
Seriously, this \_isn't ok\_. This is a psychological trigger for people with assorted addictive personality traits to make them dump \_offensive\_ amounts of real world money on skins.   
---
Frankly, I'm revolted by all the people who \_don't\_ take issue with this repugnant behavior. 
---
Yep I’ve tried that too and they freak out hah. Oh well some people get it without too much hassle :)
---
Funny you're saying the same stuff as the 20% YouTubers that haven't played the game. So does that mean they have played it. YT hey Bethesda fix your game. Redditor you haven't played it your just on the hate bandwagon.
---
I’m on Xbox and I end up doing the opposite. I have to place all my walls first, make a shell up and down, then place my stairs, then place my upper floors. Anytime I try to go first floor, first floor walls, stairs, second floor, second floor walls, the walls refuse to place.
---
If I have to move or replace a wall, I just accept that the whole structure ends up coming down and I have to start over each time. 
---
I was not this wonky at all in 4. I don’t get why the change. You’d think it would be smoother given how less room you’re allowed to work with.
---
I dont get why they don't just ban every single duper and person that asked for or boughy duped items.
---
No mercy, these people are a plague
---
&gt;  I never have to wait even as long as one minute.
---
Same, because I make sure to fight them in places they land.  Even without shooting once they will just come down if there is space to do so and they went through all their attacks.  People frustrated when they never land are fighting them on terrain that scorchbests won't land on, like dragons in Skyrim
---
Issue: C.A.M.P's being setup 8 feet from the golf course rear entrance with missile launcher so 1 person can literally walk around in circles while the launchers kill everything no work for all the reward. 
---
Solution: push the barrier on the white springs golf course further back.
---
So if that is the case it is a matter of closing the holes and people can keep their dupe’d stuff but not add to it. In some respects that’s a better result as they’re bound to ban the wrong people somehow. 
---
May I ask where exactly you mean and how you get it from there?
---
Ok, have you tried logging in and out several times? Quests will disappear from your log and only reappear when you rejoin. I had it happen to me with Rose's Super Mutant quest
---
Mine’s bugged. My camp module is inside my house. If I fast travel there, it places me on the edge of my camp. Annoying but nbd. If anyone else on my team fast travels to me camp, they travel to the camp spot inside my house. 😖😖😖
---
Seeing as how no one answered your question, google “fallout 76 crazy cat lady house” its a small unmarked house thats FULL OF CAT BOWLS, and altogether nets you about 60-80 plastic
---
You can't wear Power Armour till level 15 (but you can steal the Fusion Cores from any suits you find). When you hit 15 go to The  Crosshair, a lightly defended Raider camp. in the north-east corner of the map and you'll usually find a partial suit of Raider Power Armour there. The next step is getting to level 25 when you can start wearing T41 armour, or better still do the Miner Miracles quest (you can pick it up at The Rusty Pick) and get the luscious yellow Excavator Armour. Have lots of components in your Stash (circuits, aluminium etc) and Black Titanium and you can build it on the spot.
---
Yeah, I added that mod myself though...
---
The power fantasy point you make is fascinating but if its true, it means the games developers have less sense than the mentally handicapped, so I'm really hoping its not the case. 
---
PvP only works if its balanced. Take balance out to appease the minority and the majority of players who get owned all the time won't want to play it. The less balance there is, the less mainstream players will want to take part. 
---
Its clear the game designers want PvP to work, because you can see them trying to push it with notices in the main menu following the most recent updates. As it stands, people avoid PvP because they know explosive guns ruin it. Take these weapons away and PvP in F76 is actually pretty darn brilliant. Its my fav thing in the game by miles because when you fight someone who doesn't have an explosive round, the gameplay is wildly varied and utterly unpredictable. Almost every fight is different. That's the best thing this product has to offer!
---
That's why for all the pvp matches I arrange, I always let all players know that explosive round weapons and two shot guns are banned. As a result, the combat is really diverse and far less repetitive. 
---
It happens, just a glitch, stick with it..
---
Power armor pieces
---
The broken uplink is in abbu's bunker I think 
---
I've tried doing it but i'll try again
---
A gift emote would be amazing. I’m not very high level myself but my CAMP is not far from vault 76 so I see low level players a fair bit. I try to give them stuff and let them know that my camp in nearby for them to nap and use my work benches etc but it’s so difficult with the emotes we have 
---
It does not take that much efford to look at a report, look into the reported players inv, and then when they are confirmed dupers shoving the banhammer so far up their behinds it'll split them in two.
---
In the youtube tutorials the dupers are using the exact spot. I guess most of the dupers are not verry inovative and try to use the same spot (it has weapons workbench and a world containee next to each other)
---
Honest question here... are you getting downvoted for duping or am I missing something?
---
Have you tried to talk to her?
---
I've had that happen with some random items, a friend lost his 2 shot explosive black powder rifle. It's an unrelated bug though.
---
Ah I never thought to check achievements. I always wonder if they’re new players or just a second run or whatever 
---
Did you speak to her? I kkow it's a stupid question but I was stuck until I saw that this stupid robot need to talk to you twice
---
Did you do more then 1% of damage?
---
Is there such a thing as Cherry Grenades?
---
Creating 300+ boards triggers the disconnection from the server
---
I saw this guy in flatwoods (he was level 3) gave a bunch of stuff, and essentially built his base for him. I felt really good :)
---
I was lvl 160 with Charleston Landfill and a lvl 12 came to claim my workshop while I was making chems on a catwalk overlooking the workbench. Took all his dropped loot and left him 1 piece of wood scrap so he knew his bag actually drop.
---
No mercy
---
No, its the only course of action YOU can actually pursue, only because you give up so easily.
---
I have talked to her and all she gives me is her normal dialog nothing to do with any quests 
---
Never crash. Just miss out on loot and exp as selfish players kill everything before others get there. 
---
Can't even take them out because they will one shot everyone as well. 
---
It's so broken. Especially when you know 3/4ths of those TSE weapons are probably duped. 
---
Yes along with his bowl and lead. I need plastic but didn't have the heart to take the bowl.
---
Lol what system
---
Yeah i shot at least over 200 mm and fisted it couple times 
---
Hey idiot. Ever heard of auction sites? Duped items? Any of those ring a bell? No? How about this? https://i.postimg.cc/wjcBrK9P/lmaoo.png
---
Still in denial?
---
Man I wish my friend wasn’t so stubborn and pig headed I keep telling him to trust me it’s a awesome game (played it for 90 hours level 75) but he keeps saying exactly what the YouTube videos are saying I hate peoples some time wish I had more friends to play with.
---
Well Bethesda do like taking away stuff gamers have done for decades.
---
Ps4
---
It only weighs 10 if you put it in a chassis then put it away but I would enjoy this feature.
---
Darn would've helped, on Xbox, good luck on your travels.
---
Hahaha true.
---
I have never sold an item to a player . Anything high level gets stored in case I want it, anything lower is given away. There are SO Many guns in the game, not only legendary but but just many guns. Sure I used a +30 for robots for a while but I used it on animals, scorched, Mutants, mirelurks, mole men, SBQs, radroaches... At low levels I'd go give my gun away if I couldn't scrap it because I have zero need for it. Ah higher levels the chances of finding someone with the exact same requirements as me is minimal.
---
Besides who's going to buy a gun for triple the price a vendor will give you? I'll just mission with my Whatever until I find a Whatever Mk2.
---
Sure the TSE SHOULD be netting the seller whatever he wants but realistically they wouldn't ever be selling it unless it was diametrically opposite their playstyle. Even then if they were super super rare people would re spec to fit the TSE they have.
---
Maybe this will change with player vending, who knows. But there isn't an economy for duping to be killing.
---
As for server stability, we'll I'm happy to blame dupers for some of that. 
---
This is just an extension on a sitewide rule about identifying/personal information. Most subreddits just make it a rule because redundancy helps remind people that it is not okay to do as it leads to the identified party being threatened, bullied, ect. 
---
Since reddit isn't a witch hunting website, I'm certain you can see why this behavior is so frowned upon.
---
I helped some level 3 kid today, maybe it was him ;)
---
You looked at Madigan in the cage? 
---
The broken uplink is in the raider stash you gained access to after completing keys to the past. The last stage of Rose's endless quest line.
---
Good eye, If you do some research on the dupe process, you will find out that the boards are a part of the process.
---
Oh my
---
Do I "love" fallout 76?  No.  Do I enjoy playing it, yeppers...  
---
Is it acceptable, I would say kinda.  There are glitches and problems with the game, including crashes.  So, yes, it's frustrating at times.  The good news is that they are slowly being fixed.  It has the basis of a really good game.  Much will depend on how Bethesda handles upgrades, added content, etc.
---
Personally, I'm liking the exploration aspect of it.  But if you are looking for a deep storyline, it's probably not for you.
---
Also, it takes time to level up.  There are ways to speed this up such as partnering with a high level player and then sharing kills.  But, playing solo it's a bit of a grind at first.  So if you don't have the time to put in, then it might not be for you.  However, the other Fallout games were similar...
---
Aggroed them yesterday, they killed me almost instantly. Just respawned at whitespring and they were neutral to me again. I was able to get all my junk back without a problem.
---
"They're clearly not in full control of the game".
---
I bet someone could even say it a third time.
---
Same my friends played the beta with my free three codes and he only did random stuff like got to point Pleasant and that haunted cabins and now he says he hates the game cause of all the other bad reviews people should really read up about transcendentalism and get there own dam opinion 
---
If it makes you feel better, the loot isn't great
---
Weird sounding 'suggestion' but ok :P
---
yes and I have completed the Flavors of Mayhem quest but I haven't gotten the Key to the Past quest, it seems like my character is bugged or something
---
Yeah but i care more about xp 
---
Just avoid the place I've personally found it to not even be worth it. 
---
Thanks u too dweller
---
Shut up with the unnecessary noises sir
---
I got a technical question. Doesn't each stack count as a single item to the server? 
---
If you currently go over 1k weight limit, you can only walk while draining AP.
---
If on PC, don't use the launcher, go the install folder and run the .exe from there, it needs a login every time but that may work for you.
---
Duped items have no value at all. Don´t throw away your hard earned caps for them.
---
You know, that's quite literally a consequence of the weight limitation on the storage, the game had those laags from day1 and Beth literally doesn't care to fix them asap.
---
STOP blaming people for the poor ass state this game is in. If there's a reason this game is running poorly then it's beth, not some unanimated factor in a inventory that has literally no influence on the game.
---
Psst rule 6 :P   
---
Cool pic tho  
---
I must be the only one to run around something before I start trying to get to the top of it. Made me laugh and say damn.
---
Mmh maybe you can try to trigger it, you're supposed to go to blackwater mine and look at the computer, you have to select any entry except the last one to continue the quest
---
What level are you? and can PM psn privately for an add
---
It was never going to be a fair fight even without TSE. The level 50+ with fully speced Perk cards and full SPECIAL and a decent gun and armour was always going to be able to steamroll a level &gt;50.
---
The PvP was always going to be like this. How are people surprised just because TSE exist? It SERIOUSLY seems like it was a tacked on idea to make PvP happen. 
---
In the middle of the dry lake. Steel deposit. Might move it soon tho for rp reasons and bc it's a popular spot.
---
Yea that sucks. All that effort and a bug robs you of reward
---
I read somewhere on here that mutations have an internal cooldown of 30 minutes, negated by server hopping, and that you had a 5% chance per 5 points of radiation taken. The way i farmed mine was that i'd go to blackwater mine, sit on that bridge that tic's for like 70rads/sec and then i'd swap starched genes on and off when i was using the rad shower to scrub myself 
---
Legendary super sledge are pretty good mind..  
---
PvP in most games usually implies there's some kind of balance. 
---
There is no balance to duped TSE weapons.
---
Ah your right I completely forgot, will amend
---
How can he report you for taking junk? You’re able to do that for a reason.
---
The only proper way to get it is really to claim concrete workshops 
---
From what ive read the exploiter side of 76 has found the winterized paint and the BoS elder T60 paints
---
Nope, you can pick any Special and then toggle the filters so you can get a different card.
---
IE: pick agility, then toggle filters to strength and pick one of those cards.
---
I didn’t know SBs are into that kind of stuff... 
---
Check the cemetery in the toxic divide, I'm pretty sure that's where I got mine.  That or the Fort, one of them had a museum nearby 
---
She’s in your team, what kind of troll is this?
---
30 isn't exactly a high level I would love to play though
---
What I’m trying to say is my computer is a lower ended in comparison to yours, so the issue is on your side, not the game itself, “kid”.
---
Sure, and maybe put a limit on every material. Maybe something like 2000. I doubt many of us have more than 2000 of each.
---
can't argue with that ;)
---
Try "ban everyone who is violating the TOS". Better? :)
---
What I’m trying to say is mine is lower ended and has no issues, so it’s probably on your side, “kid”.
---
Honestly, this is how i expected the game to go without modding support. All their recent games have launched a buggy mess and the modders have been there within a few weeks with major unofficial patches that fix ALOT of the crap that breaks the game. Unfortunately we wont be getting that till bethesda either steps up their game, (which they proven they aren't going to do) or when modding is fully supported and we get the tools.
---
I love the game but goddamn without modders to fix their games, its a pile of shit.
---
LOL 😁
---
Wasn’t aware of this 
---
That and I still can’t delete one of my large water purifiers that is stuck.
---
Also had a problem with artillery the other day in that I tried to move it, but it didn’t move. The build system didn’t recognize it in either place, but it was still displayed in the first place. 
---
Server hopping did fix it... like 90% of the other problems!
---
I think you're grossly overestimating the people that are working on the student project called Fallout 76. It's probably two coders at best while everyone else is all hands on deck for Starfield. They already got your money so why should they care? The game tanked HARD and no more profit can be gained from it.
---
And they'll never fix dupers since you can circumvent it many times and the exploit is ingrained into the engine.
---
the 256 boards is apparently how they do the new dupe glitch.
---
Allows them to crash out of the server quick and not have to redo any of the setup stages.
---
At least according to a youtube video I just saw...
---
Is... distressingly easy it seems... :-(
---
Doesn't matter. Everyone is sick of these gigantic posts of lists of opinions on the game. We all know what is good and bad and what NEEDS to be fixed. I don't care what some random person with 100 hrs thinks about the game. It's such a circle jerk in this sub. 
---
I'd trade a full assassin sentinel for Bloodied, +1 strength swing speed/ power attack deathclaw gauntlet or power fist.
---
Why the F are you talking about this openly? The developers read these threads.
---
There's a second mod?!?
---
WHY DID I NOT KNOW THIS.
---
People doing this ..with this amount of turrets..are intentionally doing the glitch...to set it up in this spot  
---
they should be banned on the spot
---
Contact their ISP. Contact their parents; saying that their son/monkey/whatever is a lowest kind of lowlife in a game simulation. Tattoo their forehead. Lawsuit for easy money; I'm sure they didn't read the terms of agreement, which directly indicated that doing this will basically sell them as human slaves. Monitor their new alternatives to receive only Nocturnal Asswipe as legendaries.
---
that's between them and the scorcher. who are we to judge. 
---
And another player enabling the dupers... 
---
thank you. now if you have a moment another settlement needs our help. 
---
Buying mutation serums for 18,600 a pop from the Enclave Science Wing.
---
Sorta, even before the TSE tsunami you basically did PvP with either a double-barrel or a melee because they make armour irrelevant. The PvP is just core broken, level isn't entirely relevant after about l30 if you ignore broken legandaries.
---
Camden park has lots of random armour plans. They spawn in the raider camp. All the events associated with the Eastern pen drop weapons and weapon plans. Sugar grove has a legendary robo brain. I've had a few good prices from that. Pharma Farna perk when searching first aid boxes and you'll have tons of stim packs. 
---
TSE handmade and TSE gauss. Payed 12k for the gauss which was really cheap at the time and 5k for the handmade more recently after the market crashed with duping.
---
Yes, had 3 overlapping on prime the other day, all 3 circles showed up...
---
All I do is fucking bag in this game.  I try to help new players by bagging them.
---
LOOK AT MY BAG
---
Trucks are manufactured to be trucks and guns guns. There is a huge difference. Guns are manufactured to kill, trucks not.
---
Because fallout. That's why. 
---
Oh :p So kind of a PSA too then I guess haha
---
I hate to be that guy. But what does assinine mean 
---
Keep in mind it's also alot of people glitching stuff. Cause they think it makes them cool  for not working for their stuff. I was playing earlier and there was four people flying around with some type of gatline gun with explosive rounds  just spraying without having to reload and it dropped the frames for me and my friends to like 5 frames until it finally crashed. But it seems like there's no bans in place for those peeps.
---
Im On ps4. 
---
What platform, are you on?
---
SO you didn't know you have to level up in order to level up?   
---
Until you use your level up you are in fact not leveled up.  Didn't think that need to be explained.
---
&gt; Some guys are extremely *[ insecure ]* so they rather shit on their other half to feel better
---
FTFY.
---
Those kind of people are often physically dangerous, so OP's better off out of it.
---
They have fixed it and people keep finding ways to exploit. Over the holidays they weren't gonna expect a fix later this month or soon. 
---
Expect people to find more exploits.
---
I am now considering buying this dumpster fire of a game just to do that, you've intrigued me.
---
Weird then, wonder why it wouldn't show up
---
Thank you for the chuckle. I appreciate you. 😹
---
I've seen 3 a couple of times
---
What if it was his cat?
---
I hit 25k a couple weeks ago and had a mutation serum spawn for me. Spent the 18k or so it costs and am now again reaching the cap cap. I've bought almost every non-rare spawn plan so I guess ill just have to hope another serum recipe spawns.
---
Same, just above the Green Country sign on the map I found two.
---
I used full heavy robot with assaultron helm 
---
The Baron is just communicating very VERY basic business practices to you. Go take a look at the sales figures for a game at launch, then at the game after 2 months, even for a successful game. In a POSITIVE scenario, we're talking a 80-90% drop.  
---
From a purely business standpoint, they just aren't incentivized to put in much effort. They will put forth as much effort as it takes to minimize overall damage to the brand, but that's it. With how bad the launch went, even fixing the game to a perfect, idealized state (no bugs, no exploits, no crashes) isn't going to do much for their bottom line, and I think it's pretty obvious that they would need to do a SHITLOAD of work to get the game in that kind of condition.
---
I was really looking forward to this title, and enjoyed the 40 or so hours I played before I gave up - the actual gameplay itself is fun, but the fact that the issues with the game make it so hard to enjoy renders that moot (in my opinion). I know we all want it to be fixed, but the fact of the matter is that it's EXTREMELY unlikely they're going to break the bank trying to salvage the situation. It's a bitter pill, and I'm sure I'll be downvoted, but it's the truth, and pretending that they're going to bust their ass for no incentive is just wishful thinking.
---
Yeah I have the same problem my dude/gal. With the Nuka Cola Girl outfit more specifically, her skin texture is skrewed up when she wears the outfit, her spine is all twisted and her belly button disappears, plus the skin colour slighly changes...when you buy something you expect it to work 100%. So please, Bethesda, fix this!!!
---
When my dad tried playing a game with me when I was 13 on my N64 was the greatest 30 mins. He didn't do so well and never played since. It's awesome that you play with your son and share an interest.
---
The aim in 3rd person POV is way off. I always have to change to 1st person during fights as it's impossible to hit the side of a barn in 3rd person, even when the sights are perfectly aimed. I think it's about a foot to the right of centre.  
---
TSEs are way too good. Like fucking ridiculously better. I had a level 35 2 shot handmade that did a respectable 80 damage. My TSE does like 325. They should not be in the game
---
He just gave you a massive list. Everything becomes meaningless in a game eventually but prob not for 300 hours of farming
---
&gt;There's 10 ballistic fiber, 6-8 screws (typewriters, fans) and a load of clipboards with springs.
---
Funny, on your suggestion, I parked my camp up there, went through the entire place and saw *none* of these other than some clipboards.  Trying again...
---
What about two stacks of 150?
---
Or 3 stacks of 100?
---
How about they just fix the exploit.
---
I have a chameleon chest-piece, and I can shoot cloaked while wearing it. I'm not sure if enemies become aware of me, but I still 'look' invisible.
---
Sign that cat up for fucking e-sports because it one hell of a gamer. You don't do this shit by accident and most glitiches require a friend so ban them both. 
---
That’s the cost for recipes. And  I sense buying them for the vendor when people are selling them for 4K here on Reddit as you can get the recipes from SBQ drops. 
---
Also people sell the serum for 500-1000c here on Reddit if you don’t have the recipe.  
---
Nobody’s buying stuff on eBay for this game.
---
Dishonour on your cow!
---
Doubt Bethesda makes any money from it. There's plenty of black/grey market keys around, if you want to set up some dupe shop you can easily do it with barely giving a cent to Bethesda.
---
Same I haven't seen her since beta😭😭
---
I use the cooking emote in the atom shop.
---
Are you on Xbox? I'm currently leveling an alt to get the plans for a few friends, I could help you out if you wanna just give me the.caps required to buy them.
---
I've just been kicked off the server again (XBox1X - 2208 Sunday night, Australian time). No internet issues but 'searching for world' for the last 15 minutes. 
---
I just wish they’d only spawn (and stay) near fissures. I’ve had countless times where I’m nowhere near one just minding my business and one will just screech in out of nowhere and attack me
---
Usually 1 shot every so often won’t de-cloak you but having several pieces will let you snipe several without it happening. Really good hunted V hunter PVP.
---
Yeah. This. But why 254? Why not 10?
---
Disallowing Fast Travel when overencumbered might also be a help. I thought I couldn't and was surprised when I managed it.
---
I have personally definitely seen her since beta. Hmm. Could be a long standing issue that isn't super common to run across... especially considering it's kinda rare to run across Grahm, too.
---
Play style is exactly the same as mine, explore everything, find the hidden environmental set pieces, enjoy the scenery, nothing wrong with that! Maybe we need an explorers faction/discord and all team up, explore together!
---
I haven't lost anything yet. My T60 chassis and Excavator chassis are still in there. 
---
its almost as if these people are not "rping as raiders" but are just degenerate scum that should have been lit up by the great war.
---
Get a pet works better and cheaper on your budget
---
Side bar: I've always done the same (no chems through all fallout). My gf plays similar to OP, except she likes chems. Fo76 is one of the first times I've been tempted to use chems, and I've been in love. I usually only pop them for scorch beast queen battles, but the add quite a wallop to your punch! 
---
MUTATIONS.
---
Though I do nearly have all I want.
---
Just like a relationship between two people, you can love something and look past it's flaws. You know they are there, but you just don't care!
---
I'd like to give you more but all I have is an upvote
---
Cmon mate. You got nothing better than "just google it"??? Why even bother replying? 
---
Wait sq drops them? I have been buying them from the Enclave, I have 7
---
Sometimes takes him a while to spawn in, I've noticed. I saw him twice in 2 days. Both times with Chally, but once was the "smart" version of Grahm, and the other was a different sounding, dumber version of Grahm with a propane helmet and different armor. Why are there two different versions of the same character?
---
Melee weapons have their damage increased if they're over repaired with weapon artisan. As the durability drops so does the damage.
---
The same goes for armor.
---
I wouldn’t compare a video game to a relationship
---
Especially when this one so far hasn’t done it for me
---
Hell fallout 4 at least gave me an urge to go back and play
---
Yes, the points about game development and break/fix costing money are dumb, everyone knows devs work for free when designing or fixing a game. Also, the idea that a company would try to stay in the black on a project is unrealistic, everyone knows game studios just do this stuff to spread joy and glitter sunshine sparkles.
---
Def is. I had it happen to me just yesterday. I'm on pacifist mode and a level 190 came by in full PA and a TSE shotgun, I did a friendly wave, but then he just one shotted me and started using his machete to hack at my dead body for a full minute afterward.  Lovely people.
---
Yeah getting servers to crash or disconnect or otherwise lag out is a fairly common way of duping items....from like the Diablo 2 era of gaming. Then again this game engine has roots in Morrowind so who knows at this point lol
---
The one really poor player interaction I've had was when a legendary robot explosion killed me. A guy waited out my bleed timer picked up my scrap and disconnected.
---
They are working on it, they had a holiday break too. Updates will roll out soon. 
---
Which computer, i've checked 2 computers and pressed every option in it but I still seem to not get any quest
---
Same principle, you can love something even if it has imperfections. A lot of people do
---
Don't quote me on this, but I think a repaired power plant will provide power to all the local Public Workshops. It's like the map is divided into three power zones and once you fix a plant, all the 'powerable' locations within its 'zone' can use it. So if you repair all the power plants you can plug in anything anywhere.
---
I'll give you one for free PM me your PSN
---
I agree, but I do think you should be able to claim bounties on friends and teammates if it's below a certain amount (e.g. accidentally hit someone and got a 5 cap bounty). 
---
It's the one in the first room when you enter the mine I think. 
---
The plans are level locked if you exceed the level you cant buy them from stores
---
* Level 15-19 - Cultist Blade, Crossbow, Cryolator, Handmade Gun, Ski Sword
---
* Level 20-24 - Death Tambo
---
* Level 25-29 - Assaultron Blade
---
* Level 30-34 - Harpoon Gun, Railway Rifle, Flamer
---
* Level 35-39 - Broadsider
---
* Level 40+ - Radium Rifle
---
I've got a feeling this may be a problem with the servers they use in some areas. Players that experience server crashes and disconnects seem to get it a lot. Where are you located? I live in Australia and very rarely get disconnects and don't think I've ever been on a server that's crashed. Maybe they run several instances on single servers which makes them run badly in higher trafficked areas?
---
I'm nearly always on and I play on ps4 I would be willing to
---
Gotta be quicker than that
---
The gist of it is probably correct. Exploiting server disconnect/lag as a vehicle for item duping is an ancient art these days.
---
I have like 5k of each and every caliber and I can't shoot as much as I'm collecting :D
---
Enclave trash 
---
Simply fixing duping could cause millions other things go wrong. They need thorough testing before making any official changes
---
Yeah, now that you mention it this one sounded "smart" too. Like I remember him laughing a lot in between listing meats the "Forrest Gump meats" bit to the point of it being a little ridiculous, but he didn't do that today. 
---
Dude, no way, getting a drop that's worse than what I currently have and a plan I already know makes it totes worth it.
---
Yeah, looks like it was intended to expand the vendors list but instead it's overwriting the value.
---
My words, I’m a pacifist raider. 
---
Love this, congrats on enjoying the game and the scorchbeast kill and the road to post-breakup recovery!
---
The only issue i have with this is that if you aren't using shotguns this doesn't work. I am a rifle build and all of my points have pretty much gone into all the appropriate perks for that. its not like they are hard to kill either, its just that they are annoying to deal with. Melee players must have the worst experience though since about 50% of scorch beasts never land.
---
but u already can't FT 
---
I laughed alot harder than i should have
---
welp, I checked it, still nothing... losing all hope for this game
---
Only reason I would say 254 is there have been occasions when I have hoarded a bunch of weapons only to scrap them to learn the mods, walked around overencumbered just picking up every weapon to scrap it.
---
It's going over 254 with a crafted stack of weapons that causes the exploit to work, so limit it to its higher end to not limit player freedom.
---
And also if somebody wants to RP as "Board Man, the hero who delivers wooden boards to people's camps" and they wanna carry 200 boards then they're still free to do it :) 
---
From Australia and lately (past week or so) I’m getting routine drop outs multiple times a day.
---
Damn. I really have no more ideas. If you gave finished all quests of flavor of the mayen then I don't see why you can't go further 
---
Wait can you put anything into there to show up as loading screens?
---
God yes please
---
 I hate pulling my huge inventory of guns out for a trade just for the guy to only request my one and only TSE then just wait for me to respond. 
---
also being able to offer something unprovoked seems stupid if I have to do it every time just let us set prices a head if time maybe. Then the requested page is more of a cart that I can then approve or deny 
---
My point was not to brag, my point was to discuss some concerns regarding the game, which game has mechanics to prevent powergaming that are hurting the rest of the players, and its so easy to circumvent those, that I believe these QoL enhancements should become baseline for other players who play casually.
---
I also wrote on why do I think we need alternate methods of getting legendary loot as opposed to RNG.
---
I also desribed how to circumvent the caps vendor limit.
---
Yeah sorry, that was a long post and it might not be the best written, but it had nuggets of gold quality information in it, which you ignored.
---
I did not wrote that my english is perfect, I wrote that there is value behind each of the sentences I wrote, and that all this can be tested.
---
I failed to provide you with link to the actual science that has been poured into topic of luck vs loot, and the only think I have in my defence is that I spent twenty minutes searching for it. I was shocked when I read that, but it does answer me why, when farming on two accounts simultaneously,  I get good loot on shit char and vice versa.
---
Damn charlies, training up our molerats.
---
Just have Mutant friends 1 person shares Starched, another class freak, another Stranger in numbers. split the load.
---
I’ll go to Sugar Grove and National Radio Astronomy Research Center for farming gears, screws and springs.
---
I'm still a newbie so I'm not even sure if this exists, but I want a Super Sledge or some other two handed weapon with extra damage (maybe the "extra damage when enemy is lower than x health" one), increasing damage with more hits (Bloodied right?), and faster swing speed.
---
What kind of perks do you use and what level is the deathclaw? 
---
Good idea. I rarely play for an hour or two in a session so there's currently little incentive to hang onto Public Workstations. I just tend to claim them and do the first Defend mission for the rewards, then leave.
---
I have tried leaving gear on corpses and in random containers. But it's too random. A donation box would be great. I dropped a light armour chest and BOS plan for a lvl 20 last night. But without a mic it was just standing in front of them pointing at a paper bag with my rifle. Luckily they got the message lol 
---
One time I talked to Rose and she was talking about some key fragment, I think she was talking about the Key to the Past quest which leads me to think I had the quest but it bugged and disappeared somehow
---
Server hop, run past the down phone pole on the bridge, come back. You may get nothing, or a whole host of other spawn ins by the pawn. I even got mothman once. 
---
Can someone pls ELI5 what the weight limits have to do with servers lagging? 
---
That sucks. Haven't played as much in the last week with family stuff. Might have just been lucky with the times I've played
---
That would be too much in your case. Are you sure it is a server crashing and not network issues? Like are you playing with a team in which all of you get disconnected together?
---
Probably too late but i ll add you anyway :)
---
Every time I've seen the vendor bot, he's never had it. 
---
For weapons I have my very own executioners explosive double barrel shotgun  non duped and for melee it’s a level 35 bloodied war drum with 40% faster swing speed.
---
And only play when the starched guy is on?
---
Maybe but not "easily". I think everyone is underestimating the time and resources something like that takes.
---
Lets hope this is kept in, as there are so many places available to climb :)
---
Yeah that's appealing but I guess ultimately you want instigating and then 1 shot things. I am into a 2nd char melee build and where you really start rolling is with 1 shots. I think my dream would be an instigating death claw gauntlet (unarmed weapon) ideally with vampire / anti-armor.
---
The key in question is the thing I was trying to trigger. The first step of the quest it to retrieve a first key which is in the mine and you're supposed to find it after taking a look in the computer 
---
More like 30+ percent 
---
Yeah the handmade would be my dream one out of those -- gauss is amazing though but slower fire.
---
They have never replied to any thread since beta regarding exploits. No matter how popular they become. Really wish they would comment on the issue as at the very least it will deter those thinking about joining in on exploiting the game.
---
Some of those dupe vidoes have an insanely high watch count.
---
&gt; Rapid fire weapons would hit an enemy faster than it could be updated in the ram of the server
---
That makes no sense at all.  Do you have any idea what RAM write speeds are today?
---
they at least take 12k caps on vendors
---
savage 
---
very nice! When I hit 50 I have a bloodied assasins hatchet which might be fun.
---
I've tried to make this clear in other threads, but arbitrary bans won't work. There are hundreds of people **who played the game at launch** who would be banned simply because Bethesda's glitchy camp storing code was creating duplicates of stored items.
---
5 points on demolition expert = 1 shot everything
---
I never really got any perk cards for weapons, which could be one reason but still I feel like I shouldn't have to use a bunch levels to actually have any of my guns be good.
---
The Deathclaw was just an example but I feel like I'm wasting resources when I use a gun like a little durability on my melee weapon vs a whole bunch of bullets just doesn't seem effective. (Lvl 21 Deathclaw btw deathclaw island) 
---
I got mine as a random legendary drop. I’m not sure there’s a place to buy it or find it 
---
Now that I think of it my bf had the same bug. His quest disappeared but it came back after closing the game. He closed the game like 2 or 3 times before the quest reappeared. 
---
That's the name of my Flaming Lips cover band.
---
You can get it from events, multiple times
---
Yeah, if one breaks you still have the effect.
---
I'm sorry but both of your exes sound shit. My partner and I mock the way each other play all the time, but if they make you feel that you rather play alone,  I'd say good riddance! You'll meet someone who you can play with very soon anyway.
---
Also, congrats on your scorchbeast! I still can't kill those thing by myself so wow
---
I saw it at 11500 yesterday. But that was without hard bargin 3 I think.
---
Yep, if I remember right it's on the shelf straight back against the wall. Looks kinda like a big walkie talkie.
---
Hey bethesda team, I hope you guys are all well. First some positive feedback, I am one of those peope who are truly glad you made a multiplayer fallout because I struggle to play singleplayer games... I need a multiplayer element to truly enhoy games because singleplayer games feel too lonely for me. So thank you for that... 
---
I wanted to mention one thing that I think would really help the community feel of the game. 
---
I dont see any reason why you shouldnt be able to build closer to other people.. even if its just people in your group. I really feel the ability to essentially build towns together with a group of people, especially with the player vending feature you want to implement I think it would be good. maybe foundations should be the way you mark territory.  Or anything within a metre of your foundation and walls other cant build in. Because allowing people to just settle next to a road with friends and create an impromptu town with player vending will really fit with your vision and lore of the vault members rebuilding the world.  But currently having soo much space between player buildings really makes community building hard. 
---
And those people that put insane abouts of effort into building a town with friends would give other players something new to explore. Its win win... I guess you didnt add this for technical reasons but I hope it could become a feature in the future. A player build town or 5 or 6 buildings would be soo damn cool!! Complete with player shops and entertainment like trapping deathclaws and radscorpions and then getting them to fight in an arena or something. I dunno.. those are some ideas just incase they interest your team. 
---
Overall you made a great game even if it is a bit buggy. Not adding NPCs was a bad move but allowing players to fill that role more effectively could help. 
---
Data must be stored/tracked/transferred/whatever and more items means more data.
---
Same, i use melee weapons when I'm low on ammo or resources witch is quite often. 
---
This exploiter is an exploiter, was since the second he dropped that many turrets down. Your logic says he isn't because he didn't create them, which is complete bullshit, as he could have deleted them instead of placing them.
---
I just stuff the cash register in Flatwoods church full and hope the find it if the don’t respond to my attempts at friendliness over the mic. 
---
At end game it evens out. Ranged get better legendary effects. Eg: Standard gauss does 258 damage, TSE gauss does 1545 with same perks. Melee you have to be at low HP to really boost your numbers with unyielding gear, bloodied weapon etc. Also, the only real endgame fight requires ranged damage to ground it
---
They're just obnoxious pests:   
---
If you're in PA they tickle.  
---
If they land they die in like 3 hits
---
Well, the good news is that Beth obviously doesn't give a shit, so nothing will happen to him. :)
---
Not sure this is correct, my mate was  bulking a lot of plastic yesterday for me and could cause the server to lag  and he crashed it from bulking. We were on Discord at the time. Seems to be the rapid inputs. He was doing it deliberately to see if that was the cause because I was bitching about the loss of controls message. Same issue we were getting going through silos if we were both interacting with cores at the same time rapidly. Whole thing would bug out and take its time to catch up. No issue if we had 1 person do the mechanics, one do the adds.
---
I think the last think i'll try to do is reinstall fallout and hope to god it works because if not i'm just gonna straight up uninstall the game and be done with it lol
---
Thanks for trying to help though its appreciated 
---
Would be lovelyif you kept killing them with some of the duped tse weapons around there 😉
---
i wear it almost exclusively
---
Yah that is one critique I have with this game too. I get it is trying to be more of an mmo and is trying to think of development for something other than a solo game, but the amount of hordes of enemies, especially fast running mobs of scorched and ghouls, and the frequency of them, was really off putting and weird as an old time Fallout player at first to adjust to when I started 76.  
---
If you hang in there until level 35, there is a perk that might be useful to you. It is the Escape Artist perk. When you crouch down to enter stealth, you can lose hostile enemies that are chasing you and the danger levels go down to caution much faster when enemies are alerted and see you.  
---
I'm ok with multiple shots, I really just need something that can 1 or 2 shot most things and also do good damage to things with heavier armor, like hermit crabs, mirelurk queens, scorchbeasts, etc. I really think bloodied would shine there.
---
Thanks. So specifically when someone is carrying far over weight limit it adds an extra strain on the ability to process? 
---
You should be proud. I didn't kill my first scorch beast til lv50, and that was with a friend! Your ex is a misogynist.
---
Have you been playing games day in day out for the last however many years? No.
---
It takes practice. Hand eye co-ordination is a skill, I try to encourage my gf to play games which aren't just Overcooked/couch co-op and she's actually playing RDR2 and is further in the campaign than me.
---
Oh we fightin now
---
Jesus christ this sub is eating itself. 
---
I don't think the puny servers can handle any more crap tbh. They struggle on a good day, without any dupers on. 
---
Yet if you type it in on eBay Craiglist and even on the /r/fo76  there are listings and ppl are buying......
---
Makes sense but the endgame seems quite far from where I am 
---
Well, see, you're playing a game where you're a survivor in a wasteland, but they're playing a different game which they win by fucking up everyone else's experience, because they're garbage human beings.
---
Well I hope your quest comes back. I believe in you fallout, be nice, gives him his quest back ! 
---
Always check the containers at railway stations, that's the place many of us drop stuff for anyone that wants it. Often it's junk components, meds - anything that is overloading us. Can be quite a boon when you're starting out.
---
I can confirm that i fast travel and got the event before entering the building.  Also I got the handmade rifle plan the second time.
---
I never put much thought into bloodied weapons until I got this baby. Couple the extremely high damage with insane swing speed and adrenaline perk for mobs the damage is easily going over 500 a hit and that’s without chems or any other kind of buffs. Keep in mind my war drum is LV35 and I haven’t touched my All Rise since I got it.
---
Yeah. I only noticed this recently. The problem is that I usually forget to log out before I exhaust a core and it vanishes.
---
I got the from workshops in the mire on all my toons. 
---
And here I just wish firebreathers had an PA paint
---
I'm on ps4 too. I think I have some free shit I can give out.  I already gave out a lotta ammo to some random people. I have chems and Bobbleheads and some weapons I don't use
---
You sound like a salty idiot.
---
First of all, IP bans are ineffective. Consumer IPs change or can change when you reset the modem. Second, entire schools can share one IP. You’ll be banning an entire university.
---
“NIC card” banning is not a thing.
---
Bethesda can’t terminate your Steam account, considering 76 isn’t on Steam and Beth holds no power at Valve.
---
If you enjoy ranged, stick with it. I nearly switched because of the meta at launch and am so glad I didn't. I can't stand the playstyle of melee
---
Same same, agree. And hey, hubby and I been playing since BETA and we just hit level 36 and still have about half the map left still to explore. It's about the journey and exploring every nook and cranny, every building inside and out, taking pictures of the eager eggs and beautiful or awesome vistas, reading every note and terminal and piecing together backstories and people's lives and how they relate to one another etc.  
---
I like the sound the Guitar Sword makes. It was my favourite one-hander till I got the Black Diamond.
---
You sound like an awesome gamer! Screw that guy. Hope your tears have dried up!

I usually hate these posts but this one is pretty reasonable and makes since. The one thing I disagree with is the 200 over thing only because I'm often that far over due to my calibrated shocks and buff out and other buffs because I'm a junk hoarder from hell. I would say 500 over and you can no longer move would be better.
---
I just can't see myself buying weapons from others. Especially considering I know so many of them are duped. Really doesn't feel earned at all. 
---
Then again,  drops in this game are so bad,  I can see where people get impatient. 
---
The last time I raided someoje workshop se foufht for ten minutes then friended each other xD
---
I haven't seen Graham since the beta. I don't seem able to find him. Ever.

I'm level 123, I made leather armour, a hunters armour piercing long scoped suppressed rifle all level 1, all double endurance. I went up to the vault and waited......a level 1 player was in there at the time. While I waited I dropped a bag with 5 of everything, purified water, food, junk and the things I'd made, and 100 .308 for ammo. I stood out side and again waited. The player eventually came out at level 2, took one look at me and ran! I emoji come here, they did, stood for a moment, I motioned at the bag, they ran away again. Again I emoji come here follow me, they did, stood for a moment, with me shooting at the bag, and they ran again. So I put on my head set and talked, hoping they were English speaking. They were, they came back, took everything and stood while I gave them a few tips and emoji me love. There does seriously need to be an emoji for "I'm here to help" it would have saved me a whole load of hassle, just for trying to help! I'm doing this once a week now. It does cost a lot of resources, especially for the rifle, aluminium mostly. But I'm high level and it gives me a buzz to help others.
---
Next time, nuke their base. 
---
Initially no not a quick and easy thing. But if they were interested tools could be developed, indexing could be done and bans issued.
---
Found you can write in crossbow bolts. Look here! Free stuff dummy!

Narnaso!

Constant dark forest region where pacifist mode went of as soon as you enter. It is so dark that you can only see if you turn flash light on (risking showing your position), or by using night vision scopes. Map is disabled while inside, you cant see your position and cant teleport out of it. Also whole forest is surrounded  by  toxic cloud and explosives will kill you as soon as you use them, making exploding weapons unusable. Every 30min-1h, 3star legendary deathclaw will spawn that will give 100% 3 star item. Hope never dies.

With sugar bombs you can craft sweet rolls and Sugard Bomb God, they are sweet
---
I have started using power armour and I have slugger and expert slugger to level 3 my super sledge does 141 damage which is nice
---
Yea because I'm never gonna get the trophy if I can't kill my bf 🤓
---
Using an explosive weapon it's a good idea to include mutations in your build. Marsupial and Bird bones are great when things get in your face in queen fights so you can just jump and kill them without exploding your face off
---
Yeah I always check if the player is within my level range too, no point attacking somebody 100 levels lower
---
Yah it's gross and abusive garbage that threads the line of 'she was asking for it' defenses and excuses for women just trying to exist. 
---
Maybe he launched it right on the same spot, very very right on the same spot
---
What playform?
---
Oh. Spear plans. I thought it said spare plans.
---
Sometimes you just used 500 steel and still lack ammo
---
I think it encourages more trading between players.
---

I imagine he looked in remote places with an unusual number of low level players.
---
I love to know there is people from all ages playing this game. Awesome!
---
Did he mention her? Can you force spawn grahm like u can the robot?
---
Yeah I havent taken a workshop since they nerfed them. They're not worth my time, caps and ammo, and after losing them from constant server disconnects I just dont bother. They need a buff, not a nerf.
---
What up fellow old person. I play with my nephew all the time. He is weirdly terrible at the game. He is great at the FPS stuff but absolutely sucks at the upkeep part. We will be 5 minutes in to exploring and he will tell me he forgot to repair and we have to wait again. He levels slow as shit too, its annoying so I made a new character to play with him. Still though when I am in the middle of a group of scorched swinging my sledgehammer I wouldn't want anyone else at my back. Sometimes I'll see the bullets over my shoulder it's cool as shit. We get competitive too with getting all the kills so we get over our heads sometimes but its part of the fun. There should be a sub for older gamers tbh.
---
As a PvP player with etiquette I only pull out a TSE gun once I see that I came to TSE fight
---
If you are on xbox I will literally give you one. Some guy dropped like 30+ in a suitcase as Charleston trainyard so I have a bunch and of extras. 
---
Good idea
---
Yea lol
---
You realize that I've sent several Ebay links to Bethesda, right? Like I said, if they wanted to do something, they have enough proof to do so. But they dismiss the information, saying that there's nothing they can do at the moment.
---
Team play together so ya that how it works. when your solo you put on different cards. Do you not change your cards as it stand when you team up?
---
Because that is an inhumane number of caps and you don't need any more.
---
Maybe that's what "addressing" the issue meant 
---
My experience: I had several disconnects (sometimes even after 2-3 minutes of gameplay) and I discovered that my PS4 did not like to be connected to a 5GHz network. Since then, I never experienced any disconnection. (Europe)
---
It happened to me too. I had to create a mouse macro for fast scrapping all that mess.
---
I feel like anything over 100 should be split between the offended &amp; the collector &amp; if one of your friends/teammates kills you, all of it goes to the offended.
---
how much of a dick would you feel like if you had a 1,700 bounty on you for fucking with someone &amp; you wound up giving it to them instead of your friend being able to claim it for you?
---
Me too, lvl 115... Need a legit team, I love this game and wanna find a few ppl who like it as much as me. 
---
Psn 👉 ignoremeow
---
I'm level 10 and I bought the game on release :D  
---
I'd seriously consider giving up, if my char would be reseted
---
How tho
---
If you think that fallout 76 mods will allow the kinds of things that mods do for Skyrim or Fallout 4, you will be sorely disappointed. Consider this. The world is literally ending, according to 90% of the posts in this thread. When every player has the ability to create a mod that allows them to have all the legendaries and experience, imagine the hysteria. This whole subreddit will be filled with people dousing themselves in gas and lighting themselves on fire. Yeah, that might be hyperbole, but I think you should be able to understand my point. Mods will have to be UI-only or possibly restricted to private servers. 
---
I had a 1v3 encounter where all the players oneshotted each other. I was the lone guy, and my weight was low at the time so I could run without PA. I consider that very fun encounter and, caps-wise, a draw, and since everyone oneshotted everyone, it was 100% about positioning, map control and sneaking.
---
Please point to the part in the TOS where it says being over-encumbered is not allowed. 
---
I agree, I'm just saying I dont think they are interested in spending the resources to do that when it would be easier for them to just fix duping and leave it at that. I think it would be best for them to introduce new higher lvl equipment and better items thereby obsoleting all the duped stuff...  once duping is fixed.
---
Nah gotta get that bread know what I’m saying 
---
So just for you 
---
Nic cards have a Mac address associated with the device. so you can do that. 
---
Bethesda has other games on Steam so ya they could use the other information they have like your email address and card on file to alert steam of your action. 
---
True, gotta stay on the grind
---
Hoarding caps is pointless, go out, spend them, have fun..  
---
If you don’t you’ll be stuck at 25k? Lol
---
This game makes me hate anyone with real friends. Where do u get off actually being able to use charisma cards
---
Here's my build if you're interested. You'll see the swap outs based on whether of not your in group, stealthily or in a nuke zone. It should make sense. Main mutations you should have are marsupial, Bird bones and speed demon.

Im all about better wepons and ammo. Got a bunch of bobble heads and chims. I explore alot. Currently lv 20. Mostly hunt super mutants. What's ya game take. Ilk send invite when I get home in a few hours 
---
Lewis Berg, Camden , Welch, harpers  I actually may still have some if you’re on pc shoot me a msg and I’ll see what I can do for you. Also vaguely remember having other mods as well for it.
---
I think "competitive" is too light and makes it seem softer "boys will be boys" thing than what this kind of behavior usually is.  Pretty toxic or even abusive. Insulting or putting down your significant other (or anyone else for that matter), undermining or tearing at their confidence, telling them what they can or can't do, etc. isn't just competitive but being an harmful asshole.
---
god, so many times i just needed a simple "point" or a "gift box" or even a 30sec local quest marker to let other players know its for them or key somone into something to pay attention to and they can have/take/use it....
---
yeah, they are. Did some trading with someone a few days ago on the road to who knows, Asked him if you would get plans as a reward. He told me he never has but don't bring them all so I can "turn them in one at a time "
---
Did...did you not get the joke that it's the angry wife?
---
This comment right here, Kovac
---
&gt; their official response basically just hinted that ~~if you screw up your game,~~ they're not going to help you fix it
---
They try to keep inflation down by controlling the flow of currency into and out of the game. Unfortunately duping has fucked this.
---
Love that sopt. You can launch yourself. It just takes you to the edge of the map. 
---
Plans I already have.
---
MAC addresses can be spoofed and like I said, they hold no power at Valve. Valve isn’t going to ban your account because of a violation on a game that is distributed through another eShop. You also assume then that everybody uses the same email for Steam and Bethesda, which is already false in my case.
---
So TL;DR Tobacco isn't an issue, gotcha.
---
I've been hoarding them for a while,  On my Main from Beta; I just tossed them at some point. I don't like the brotherhood of steel app I never pursued the quest line until now in accident.
---
that's not true, I keep them in storage.
---
You need to be like level 50 to launch a nuke. You also have to join the enclave
---
Lol just be thankful it hasnt hit SWBF2 level yet, 6+ months for one new character and yes im deliberately being hyperbolic as SWBF2 had numerous updates during that time, but if you went off the community, it had only one real update in 6+ months.
---
NemoTouchedDaBut lvl 115 on ps4 
---
You know what that sounds exactly like what happened
---
&gt; COD and Destiny
---
ew! I mean at least get them playing bfV :)
---
It does. 
---
Good on you and your accomplishments your exes are unsupportive douche canoes 
---
Hello guys, just putting this out there yesterday at level 135 i got the Handmade Plans from doing the event Patrol Duty at the Penitentiary just thought i'd let you guys know if you don't want to level a new character with some luck you can still get those plans from that event. Enjoy
---
There just is no point to use them they make so little difference and last such a short period of time. I would have to look into it but if you could get chems to last like 30m on one use I might look into a chem build, only because overdrive is pretty fun.
---
If ahe(or yourself) ever need help feel free to add me MrSharkBone and is be glad to help, this game is much better if we’d help each other.
---
camp venture, I don't know remember how you get the quest. It sort of just came up when I was moving things in my storage. My time boy displayed a message saying " You should head probably head to camp venture to store these documents in their cache." Why does it matter if they are all dead?
---
Going to take a guess but most of the people that are duping are not forward thing to spoof a mac address. And the effort needed to do that on console is to much.   
---
good thing is it PSN and x-box live will take a complaint from a company from Bethesda and drop them fast.
---
You are dating some serious jerks by the sound of it! I mean who says any of those things to anyone, let alone their gf. Talk about insecure dudes. I hope you find a nice guy ! Nice guys finish first. 
---
I like melee playstyle I just hated how 8 rockets did less damage than A powerfull swing with my sledge
---
Hubby and I are the same way exactly on all of that. It's so nice to see other queer couples out in the wastes like that. I actually was the one that introduced him to the fallout franchise in our first years of dating, before FO3 came out, and he really hardcore loved it. Now over ten years later, we're still together and married, and finally getting to explore the wasteland in as close to a co-op game experience as it can get in a franchise we both love.
---
I run sluggers for 9 points martial arts for 3 and evisorator for 3 then I run 15 int because i LOVE crafting. With this build and a Sledge I can two hit everything and melee down a scourgebeast at lvl 25 in one landing. I started nuke zones at 35 with zero trouble in excavator power armor.
---
&gt; They used to be able to rely on modders to fix all their shit and now it's come time to pay that bill.  
---
I managed to play thousands of hours in FO3 without ever modding it, Thousands of hous in NV without ever modding it and 780 hours in FO4 before I finally decided to mod it, I had maybe 1 mod that fixed a bug with spotlights not producing light.  
---
I downloaded the Unofficial patch and it made my game worse.  
---
I dont know where this concept of modders fixing their broken games has come from
---
Yes. That's also why the stash has a limit.
---
Ohh those are hella cool
---
It’s easier to switch servers any way.  I logged on last night to see that both of two workshops I was interested in were already claimed.  Instead of causing a ruckus, before even leaving my C.A.M.P, I did a quick logout/login and the next server had both the workshops unclaimed.  Much easier and more productive and time efficient than back and forth attacks with another person.
---
This is the exact kind of person bethesda needs to get onto banning in the most harsh of ways.
---
So my first fallout game was 3 and I was told to rush it.. finished the main quest and that was the end! That was when I stopped listening.
---
Thanks. I'll see if I can create something similar.
---
I don't exactly know where I said that but, atleast with many weapons, you will need lots of lead and steel for ammo.
---
Why and how does it say Responders after your name?
---
Good to know. Thanks. What are best things to hold onto in your stash and best to sell or trash? I've got my carry items slimmed down to virtually nothing. 
---
While you’re here, how do I do that?
---
lol. 
---
I'm not even a software developer or anything and I even knew that made no sense lmao 
---
Doesn't hold up irl
---
Not going to happen.
---
Power armor is {loud and noisy} it's also {heavy} things that do not work for stealth. You could max all stealth perks, but you'd still fail. Power armor is for face tanking stuff.
---
Just get shadowed, muffled/ultra-light leather pieces. 
---
Did somebody unshare a perk such as bloody mess?
---
You don't need a build, just demolitions expert, and start one-shotting.
---
Yay! Funny endgame!
---
Yes, dropping is bugged, drop 1 round of some amo first, if the bag is there then drop the more easy to get stuff :)
---
They’d be in the room while I was playing 
---
Google. Melee is the most prevalent of builds in the search engine.
---
Hold on...WHAT?! YOUR CRAFTING BENCH?!!!!! Not to mention you didn't show a good 5 min before this of you annoying me to get to this point of insanity! Pffft...crybaby....love you anyway.
---
You think that’s bad, I have a character with excavator armor who has finished the quest, who somehow cannot make excavator armor now...good times
---
it's very loud in power armor and you can't turn invisible. Stealth doesn't work really in power armor.. there's not a much synergy and perks you can utilize whilst wearing it.  I suggest not wearing it if you want to do stealth. You get really high damage modifiers and will mostly one shot everything. I've been playing around with a stealth / pistol build . It's really easy if you use a western revolver or whatever Wesson your comfortable with. Plus- no worrying about the scorched beast cause it can't see you and goes away.
---
Hey just be thankful your fictional decendent isn't a phycotic brain in a jar! &gt;&lt;
---
It’s a bloody good two cents. With my most recent ex, I definitely ignored the hundreds of red flags early on in the relationship. It won’t happen again.
---
How is duping done? Can we just get some transparency on the actual method? I googled it and it seemed like there was a mortar canon ammo box method which has been patched. Everyone seem's to be alluding to it without talking to the real method but can we just open it?
---
You forget one thing. Banning a player permanently is not profitable, therefore it won’t happen.
---
Banning an account is profitable. The player will reform and buy the game again (thus receiving an additional $20-30) or keep repeating, and net them even more money. Them exploiting doesn’t really cost Bethesda anything while they work on a patch.
---
Why do you think most game services don’t ban this aggressively? It’s free money. I can’t name any. Even a full Steam ban will allow for a new account. They’ll never ban by IP for account-related transgressions.
---
Congrats on the kill! I think they've gotten into your head. You've got to be pretty good at Fallout to kill a scorchbeast by yourself. It sounds like your ex-boyfriends were the -wear you down so you don't believe in yourself- type. Those type of men do that because they are afraid to lose you, because they see you are good enough that someone else will gladly take their place. It is more about them and their little boy insecurities than it is about you. I hope your next boyfriend is a little more mature, and that you keep enjoying video games.
---
How is it obvious I’ve never fought the queen , if you want I can share some of the photos , and when people say stuff they don’t mean , they usually don’t go and make a reddit post about it.
---
They do crop up as do chickens and squirrels just not very common, but as the squirrels they taste like chicken too.
---
It is a long and tedious process but well worth it. It would be better if you were to search up a video explaining how to do so instead of trying to read a explanation by me riddled with spelling errors.
---
I do understand holidays and all. 
---
Though the state BGS is in right now. They REALLY need to be on the ball, not laxing around and taking time off. I know not all of them are but still, if the heft of the company is gone .. nothing gets done &gt;.&lt;.
---
They are also new to this style of game which very much shows. Most mmo's or online games tend to patch stuff in for xmas up to and including bug fixes, exploit fixes and new seasonal events. Not just .. you know .. cash shop items like we've been getting :/.
---
This is comedy gold, thanks for the laughs!!
---
"A dupers lvl 390 friends wasted all their ammo" Next time you are making stories, try not making stories and providing screenshots if something fun actually happens
---
Even still , the damage that would’ve been dealt is like 1 HP.
---
Good point, thanks though
---
It's good for tagging and low level zones.
---
Haha I like that idea, but my preference would be thar it goes to the offended if they are killed by a friend, if someone else kills them its theirs, and maybe even add  more to the reward if you were the offended but you claimed the bounty
---
No problem
---
I feel like I'm the only person who has no problems killing scorchbeasts with my basic auto combat rifle build haha. Like 3, 20 round magazines in vats and they dead.
---
Not sure how I could have proved it.. I did take a dodgy photo with my phone of the tv after I killed it?
---
I do not think we've be able to see it unless we had access to the server, where all the information is stored.
---
I loved it after like 0 hours. But I watched a lot of a good chill streamer playing it (SolidFPS) and knew what to expect. And honestly what to expect was, no more buggy than any other good bethesda game. Perfectly acceptable for me. 
---
&gt;No fast traveling means I encounter tons of the random encounters, inevitably run into things I've not previously discovered and generally have a good time murdering the wild life and looting and pillaging the whole time.
---
I can attest to this. Though it does kinda suck being in power armor all the time it is fun seeing all the things I would have missed out had I fast travelled, like the cryptids and unmarked locations.
---
Not having to worry about encumbrance as much also  means I usually have plenty of stims, food and drinks to share with my group, and I'm not constantly stopping to contemplate which item I need to drop if I find something new.
---
It's totally a viable playstyle. 
---
I love this post so much &lt;3
---
if you don't want to PvP then you have no business at workshops. I don't care if someone's level 1. Go get your high level Alt / friends/ brother / your dad [ happened once very awkward] and come back and try and take it. First one to go broke walks. it's like the game within the game for me. If I can't take a workshop and don't have any money. I don't server hop. I go crawl around Ash heap ( my favorite biome) I usually have enough of whatever to accomplish whatever I wanted the workshop for. People act like they should be allowed to hold a workshop but they aren't strong enough to d hold it- they are made for people who want a risk vs reward. That's why it warns you as you take it PVP
---
It's not only the dupers, it's also players who want instant gratification (and imo only hurting their own gaming experience, but heh, that's just my opinion).
---
Also, young gamers probably are really used to MTX (=paying) so if they pay to a company or some other entity they don't care.
---
Bethesda should just make it the highest priority to end this right now.
---
The mule can obviously only be used as a mule, why would I want to "use" it for anything else?
---
Yes, I have to go to where it is (on my main) before I can log in with it, since it's far too heavy to move anywhere itself in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Second account on a second computer.
---
gonna laugh when server hoping gets forget gimped again. 
---
Maybe that's just her way of playing and how she likes to play. You can encourage her and show her how you play and share why you do it this way or that, but if she is happy playing a game a certain way and it doesn't bother her, then let her enjoy her gaming time. If it bothers you that much that it is affecting your moods or causing any arguments then it might be that you guys shouldn't play this together.
---
Same experience, it just started yesterday. Glad I'm not crazy.

I can't wait to get this perk, it is my carrot on a stick now.

In destiny there's a limit too. You don't need more, when you spend it then you're going to play to gain more etc etc 
---
Gosh network programming looks difficult. 
---
Different random encounter. I've finished all the responders missions and found that thing so damn many times.
---
Mayor for one day quest leads you up there via elevator... 
---
Oh, alright, you just want to be obtuse. It's the part of the TOS that says exploiting bugs may be punished by actions up to and including banning. It's right under the part that says intentionally misunderstanding what people are talking about so you can push your own narrative with strawman arguments to try to justify shitty behavior is something for assholes with bad reasoning skills. I think it's on page 7.  
---
Then again, you seem to be of the opinion that 'Only awful developers ban players for taking advantage of their mistakes', so you obviously don't think anyone should be banned for exploits, and can therefore fuck right off out of this discussion about people who don't think exploits are okay.
---
Why 254?  There is absolutely no reason anyone should have more than 10 identical weapons at any one time.  Especially legendary ones.  Hell, limit identical legendary weapons to 1 or 2.  
---
TSE are to be nerfed hard, they’re far too powerful for the rest of content 
---
I think the reason it disconnects you is Saving the inventory which it can't due to some engine limitations or bug.
---
Same here.

Also the armour stands from fo4

So Golf Club can hold only 21 billion bodies until shit's start disappearing?
---
Lvl 137 currently, I've found that while in eye line actually unequipping what ever weapon I'm holding and removing my power helmet seems to get a positive response. Still I'd love a gift icon or emoji to show there is stuff in the bag at my feet.
---
Failing that the ability to do the Carlton dance from fresh Prince in PA, that should indicate I'm insane but friendly... 
---
I really want to get this game. Thanks for the amazing write up it was well said and should be sent to a publication more people should see this that are on the fence. 
---
Why should you be in areas that cap around lvl 25-35 when you're lvl 50? At lvl 50 you should roam the savage divide,mire and cranberry bog or you will get loot far under your lvl...
---
The main quest has for most parts useless rewards (sommerset special is ok but it's only a 1star legi .44) and you can take shortcuts (you only need to do fort clintlock to join BoS and The Enclave(which doesn't need it for joining but for unlocking the general rank)).
---
your a shit player if you can't strategize and push back . I don't use TSE because it's a one truck poney. If you surpress them and get the drop on them every time instead of standing there looking at your pipboy then TSE is just another " Tryhard" meta tactic in the book. Approach the situation like a real battle. make it so they have to get in close to see you, or they can't see you at all and you figure out how to kill them in 3 hits or main them so they are more worried about staying alive then trying to fire at close range and hurting themselves. Build compartments, think like fortnite. you can build when they are in the area and they still can't see you if your stealthed. You can make trap rooms and all kinds of funny stuff. Box them in with porta potty house missle launchers that only get activated after stepping on a switch- that way they are right where you want them and don't see it coming. There's lots of workshop tools people don't use that if your corner and test with a buddy can keep anyone off your space if your not strong enough a build to do so
---
I wouldn't say it's bullying as such, but if I see someone contest a workshop, my thought is "oh come on dude...", when they could just server hop... Chances are it'll be unowned in the next server.
---
There is an acknowledgement screen.  Not paying attention is not a poor design.
---
I dont mean the strong ones, I mean those who look like scrap metal sheets
---
Shame!
---
That is the very last thing I died to several weeks ago and haven't touched the game since. I had to fight a radscorpion queen and her million minions and I tried so hard but ultimately failed when those burrowing bastards killed me even as I ran off down the road well out of range of the queen. 
---
It's a nice gesture, but I wouldn't want to take your stuff because I want to get the most out of the game, struggling to get by with crappy gear. Being given everything immediately defeats the point of that.
---
-A new player who ran away from you. 
---
This is how I did it also. Also the building outside Beltching Betty with the robot and the basement of the rusty pick. 
---
Damn, that's a good build. I will definitely make a similar build!
---
Your strength is 10 in power armor no mater what it was before you put it on.   
---
There are armor mods that raise this to 12 but only for carry weight.
---
See i could see that being a thing with my idea, so actually more and more towns get added in over time as NPCs come back and it would make more sense in terms of the story we have currently that everyone is dead in the area
---
I think I've suffered more jump scares from mole rats than just about anything.

I was tired, I've learnt a lesson. But using those two adjacent keys is asking for trouble, they had a whole keyboard to choose from.
---
That's what I need, railroad spikes.  I'm trying to get to the top of that big tree in Tangara town, I got to all but.  Someone is going to tell me there's a lift there too?  Shoutout to the person following me that I frustrated because I have no mike.  I gave up, but I will be back with railway spikes!
---
Thanks for the downvote though, appreciated.

Understandable.  Danse and MacCready could get me to do or not do a lot of things.
---
hmm.. I disagree it's all about caps my man. I will take taking a workshop so people will keep defending it just to get a bunch of money, when the fight he's to rock but I've run out of stimpacks, I just straight up bounce and turn in the junk they dropped. Once your broke ( from dying too much) it's game over. You get that Bankruptcy penalty which lasts 4 in game hours.. -50% damage to players +50% damage from players. If some bone head keeps coming back you'll know he's broke if his damage suddenly becomes laughable and he seems squishy as hell. Just stand your ground and keep taking in the caps off their sorry butts
---
Huh, I watched someone on YouTube do it and then trade with the bot. I guess I just gotta do the mission. Might be a different bit I guess 
---
caps are King
---
Plot twist.. they have been on vacation since release and and have being rolling out updates and messages because they predicted everything it would happen
---
If they have a camp you can destroy it they don't care about resources but time is still time.
---
PC and I am an idiot, sorry.
---
Its the same problem that the Witcher 3 had with the arrow system.   
---
Items are scraped as individuals so you would get lead from each bullet but the crafting requirements are much lower. So unless they overhaul the entire scraping mechanic it will never happen. due to the ability to produce more material than used to make the original. Add perk card to the mix and it is a nightmare for coding so sorry man this will most likely never happen.
---
And the people that bought stuff on eBay and PayPal should be banned too, 
---
Absolutely. All of my FO experiences have been official non-modded versions and never had a problem. Sure this is maybe just anecdotal but the great mod-saviours are over hyped. 
---
There seems to be no QA with mods either. Some one hacks together a mod and churns it out. It’s quite possible it fixes the problem, but does it cause unintended bugs elsewhere?  Possibly. There often seems to be problems with multiple mods stacked on top of each other when you read gaming forums. 
---
Then there seems to be just a whole group of people who can’t play a game in a balanced way and use a mod to make their shotgun spew out with a fire rate of a machine gun because they feel that a shotgun is too slow. 
---
You just made me imagine a whole group of anxious people with overactive startle responses teaming up and simultaneously yelling when anything (a ghoul, a possum, a leaf) appears. 
---
It's more that it's completely broken now. My workshop got taken over yesterday, for the hell of it, I thought I'd try to take it back.
---
But due to the TSE weapons, I just got one-shotted. That's not how PVP is intended to work. 
---
I didn’t vote either way.
---
Same place, warehouse building set and garage door
---
&gt;  I heard a rumor 
---
Source?
---
There isn’t. 
---
So you have at least two perks increasing melee damage, and minimum 11 str (from the power armor), but you don't want to use perks to make guns stronger?
---
Yes because melee was already strong without those perks
---
It's even worse with the heart icon. Whenever a high level player do it I run in fear 
---
Also delete their social network accounts and lock them in a f\*\*king jail, amirite? You need someone to dupe the few braincells you have. Banning them from the game is more than enough of a punishment, calm down
---
Thats the bit that will slow down a corporation like bethesda is QA, like you said and like everyone who has ever modded a game before, mods cause bugs, lots of them.  
---
In the 780 hours of FO4 before mods my game crashed maybe 4 times, 2 of those were trait after patches or dlc, as soon as i started modding it my game would crash roughly every 20 minutes or so
---
Going threw my internet history now it was on another post from about 2 days ago.
---
I love reading about people like this when I think that “I am getting into video games too much” and tell myself to “get a fucking life.” 
---
Christ I’m so happy I’m not one of these fucking nerds. 
---
i have a non PA melee, fist weapon build, atm 350 ballistic 300+ energy (str,end,agi def perks) and on low health i got the legendary +35 def effect that could bring me above 500+ (PA stats and possible more) i can go with a hazzmat suit to whitespring if its nuked and need maybe 2-4  stims... i miss some mutations and a bloody weapon and with them i think i "CAN" be overtake a PA... Sure PA is the "easyer" way to get early good def stats but is without the FO4 Mark 1-6 upgrade in the lategame not better ;)
---
I guess on the bright side, you got a bunch of junk that you’ll never use that’ll indefinitely Weigh you down, and that guy will have all his junk back in an afternoon.
---
Someone should tell Bethesda that ...
---
I think there's a growing divide between the camp that hasn't played an MMO before and the rest of us.
---
There's been threads with people suggesting that just to process of exp farming (as in completely legitimately killing enemies) constitutes an exploit, because it's not how they personally think the game should be played.
---
There's several comments just in this thread, which suggests the way to "easily" deal with cheaters is with an automated check that would also have me banned since I meet the criteria they propose (completely legitimately), the idea of farming seems to be completely alien to them.
---
Best reply so far:
---
&gt; Oh? And how exactly would you be storing 100k of steel scrap (weighing 3000 lbs.) on one character without either using the infinite carry weight exploit or making the character so encumbered as to be impractical to ever use?
---
It's a mule, of course it can't be used for anything else. :3
---
everything has a counter.  build around weapons and gear and exploit weakness  Sneak and spy on your target with binoculars, try to watch them fight and case em out. Are they using a shotgun? plan for a long range fight, TSE rifle? play the short game with explosives.  learn the area and close the distance before they can react. Are they bouncing around with marsupial? full demo and a quad missle launchers with target computer blows them to bits in mid air. Swap out to an auto grenade launcher with your Grenadier rank 2 if they go for cover against your missle onslaught. If they are unarmored use  Mirv- grenades for power armor use pulse. Think of a player a another enemy and strategize
---
I ran into chally by herself in Charleston running at break neck speed like she was trying to find Graham
---
people are just watching too many streamers and trying to use pve tactics against players. The player base will evolve eventually. TSE is not end all.. just a popular common approach.
---
This is exactly what I was hoping to see I’m glad to see your pulling those numbers without PA
---
Great spots!
---
I have a few more I like. 
---
One is in an alcove / canyon just north of Ella Ames bunker. It has an existing shack, tinker workbench and is protected on 3 sides. Constant spawns too if you want to sit and farm.
---
The other is a nice little rest stop / information booth w/ 2 restrooms and a parking lot. Nuka cola machine, about 5 cans (if you are working can-do). North of Huntersville near the fork in the road.
---
There’s a nice boxcar with a set of table and chairs, couch, cabinet and desk plus a few other containers nearby close to Lewisburg Station, directly west of Lake Reynolds . That is / was a fun spot.
---
don't ban them... 1st fix then remove all their items
---
I love this thread. Stealth non-binary on the pc and creeping everywhere and exploring everything and sniping things from afar is 95 percent of my fallout gaming life.  
---
You know what, I aim for the head from stealth but when they aggro and run towards me I switch to the legs to try to cripple them so I can manage the group better. Maybe I should try sticking to head shots even when they charge. 
---
I've used wire shark in the past to do a data capture log some of that data has to be generated from the end user's system. or does it all exist server side? Haven't done any data tracking like this since like 2004 when we would monitor all the communication that WOW would do. Back then you could use an exploit to do something similar to what people are doing now. Like I said I don't really do modern coding.
---
I got then very early in the process at maybe 10% or way later like you said at about 80%.  I just stood near the barrels at the the bridge just south of the Nuka Plant, if that matters.  
---
There's a stealth boy power armor mod. I have it but don't use stealth and haven't tested it's effectiveness but it's cool as hell to look at 
---
Could do what I did when I built with a lot of concrete found a concrete node, move camp and build hobo camp aka 4x4 small home with a wall separating crafting area from bed and instrument.
---
Cooking station on porch. Let that run while you do other stuff come back collect concrete, repeat till not needed then find your perfect build site.
---
Shooting the head will take less ammo. Use shotguns if you go for crippling. 
---
Nah, it's Bethesda's terrible server infrastructure and netcode.
---
Got it, thanks. I'll try to level up some more in the forest zone and maybe improve my sneak before I head there. 
---
The current game is essentially broken beyond repair, ***if you are looking to play it for anything competitive***.
---
At this point, I'd suggest you just have fun in different ways and wait for them to:
---
1. Fix all duping possibilities, and add tools to detect duped items **in the future** and automatically delete them. It is hard to delete all existing duped items without also affecting legitimate players who bought items not knowing they were duped.
---
2. To effectively soft-wipe all existing duped items, add new item levels going up to level 100.
---
3. Fix the Two Shot and Explosive legendary traits so that a level 10 TSE weapon does not outperform a level 100 non-TSE weapon. Adding additional competitive traits would also not hurt.
---
4. At this point it finally becomes safe to add new content to the game, including PvP content. Unless the above or similar steps are taken, this game is, quite frankly, done for.
---
that gun is very disappointing, I tried to find ways to use it in PvP.. even legendary versions. Sucks in PVe too but good luck. Don't get your hopes up.
---
I got a two shot explosive Tesla rifle that’s a beast 
---
You doubt people have loads of the experience buff bobble heads? In this day in age?
---
They can't unfortunately they didn't build an asset item ID into each generated item so... there is no way of seeing if 2 copies of an item exist. The engine was built for solo gaming.
---
I'm taking your advice and plan to double check that I've been sticking to the forest. 
---
Outside of reddit I haven't met a single person who gives a shit about duping or the economy...nor have I met anyone who has traded with anyone but their friends.
---
so how can the devs know that they've dupped?
---
Ah. I see. Was pretty surprised tbh
---
I hate dupers, but authoritarian POS like you I despise.
---
As Wallace said: The government cannout be trusted, live free or die.
---
It's more common than you think, lot of people have mules. 
---
I'm using one myself for selling / storing every items I want to sell on trading subs.
---
I need a mule also because I can't sell items anymore if I'm at caps limit and that's pretty much a necessity for anyone actively trading with other players.
---
Using another mule for junks storing, I can't sell bulks to vendors anymore or else I'll have to create another mule for caps at some point so I just store every junks from my main to my mule.
---
Check on the map, when you see high level player at V76 next to a low level, it's most likely a mule transfering stuffs, buy items on trading subs, most likey you'll find out people are selling from their mule.
---
Dupers aren't the brightest bulbs on the string
---
If you’re wondering if you get sneak damage, you can pretty reliably ... if you’re working ranged. Something like a combat rifle, mid-range head shots. Of course, anyone can get sneak damage sniping at draw distance, and PA is no different.
---
It’s doable - but don’t count on it as your only damage option. 
---
Oh. I was expecting the text body to just be, "He's still there because of Bethesda's awful pathing and protectron walking."
---
So Bethesda adds weight limits but what the should have is a limit of items he can carry or like a cap of 5k wood or something for example. Probably fix this issue and get rid of are weight issues.
---
I fine plans in weird places- like a Gatling plasma in the wall safe of the Watoga post office on my level 95.  I also have never seen the flamer plans and this is my third character since Beta. 
---
On a single character legendary should never stack. Simple fix would be to just cause all Stacked legionaries to delete. LOL
---
I had way more than that at 1 point maybe i still do. I try to give away as much as i can since i never use 308.
---
maybe it's designed this way to stimulate an economy so low level players can sell something to high level players.. what's the min lv on that gun ? 15? makes no sense..
---
I was wandering to Whitesprings (as a lvl 20) and accidentally got too close to a fissure (not realizing what it was), only for a nearby Scorchbeast to find me and desecrate my body. I had to burn 6 Stealthboys just to get my stuff back.  That shit ain't fair!
---
You're saying OP is lying?! Why, the audacity! /s
---
I think they are already washing their hands of this game
---
your welcome, sure ther are allways pro and cons on both side
---
PA: radiation resis and a jet pack is nice to have but ATM no mark upgrade/legendary verions are definitly good pro´s
---
nonPA: real nice legendary versions aviable but need time to grind(or buy) and so on
---
it depends on the player himself...
---
i NEVER played a melee char in my fallout games but this time, i made him for fun (and because i didnt like the PA in 76) took a build creator, tested it and now its my main char lvl80+ \^\^ 
---
if some one told me u wild like to play a melee char, i would had laugh, took my rifle out and put i round between his eyes... now im a believer \^\^
---
That's wild, because I have most of the pipe rifle mods that I know of. 
---
I really hope you get caught up and banned erroneously, that would be really hilarious and you would 100% deserve it.
---
The latest boogieman. There will always be something to blame crap on. I have a black powder 2 shot rifle(not explosive), you know how many "fuck your 2 shot explosive" msgs I get after engaging in pvp?
---
Oh my god... i didn't expect to read this so forgive me for sounding sappy in some spots.
---
My mother was a UO player back in the day and very younger me (probably around 6,7,or 8 as well. i can't remember which.) but i was interested in the game she was playing and quickly became hooked. 
---
To this day that game remains a huge part of my life even if i don't play it too often, so many fond memories and made so many friends. hell, even joined a guild that didn't even care about how young i was. the guild master even bought me the high seas expansion as a birthday gift. those were the days...
---
now here i sit, about to be 21 and forever remembering those fond memories, once again i find myself in an online only game that i love, in this case: Fallout 76.
---
Bingo. I just wanna make more cool shit. 
---
I love this.   I play fo76 with my younger sister who lives 2 hours away so it's a great chance for us to just chat while we play together.   We sisters all used to love playing video games together so it harks back to simpler times before jobs, kids and bills
---
While your at it 
---

Level 40+ - Radium Rifle
---
The fear is real. On my alt I do the same. I lost count of the amount of high level players that followed me to my camp to start a rampage, or goaded my to follow them to have a mate blow up a car next to me ( and take my little bag of junk) , Even if it is just a few arseholes doing it you tend to stay away from people. 
---
Gery market key retailer ?
---
I find Emmett Disposal Site just a little east of there to be even better. The rad barrels and shower are just a few feet appart. It's only around 20rad/s, but it still does the job just fine.
---
That's correct. Players would likely have their own instance of data on their local machine, but you cannot gather Bethesda's database without logging into their server. That would be a huge security risk if you could. 
---
Nice, I was thinking of the deathclaw in nuked whitesprings that spawns sometimes. Wonder if that would be possible? I think its glowing. Would be baddass though!
---
I agree these “raiders” are cowards
---
It's better than when they go invisible. I find a good remedy for your bug is to simply unequipped and reequip an outfit and hat. 
---
It doesn't seem to be a thing. I'm level 126, use shotguns exclusively, and have a 30% cripple chance &amp; a 15% stagger chance, yet have NEVER crippled or staggered a Scorchbeast. 
---
I'm assuming that's not intentional and that they'll fix that at some point. As it stands now though, I just disappear and hide whenever I see one since they land so rarely that I can never get in range to even hurt them while at the same time they're able to role-play as a god damn AC-130 doing constant bombing runs with that damn Sonic blast that has the fire rate of a fucking minigun.
---
Someone else gave me the advice to stick to the starter forest area for a while longer so I think I may double check that I haven't been heading to areas with mobs that are too high in trying to follow the overseer quest line. I'm definitely interested in the phantom devices and think that might be a good idea until I reach 35 and can get the perk that causes me to drop aggro by crouching. The mats seem difficult to obtain so I couldn't take more than a couple and I don't have anything exciting to trade yet. I'll add you next time I play though. 
---
keep the day job
---
Oh, and i suppose you could fix it in 5 minutes?
---
First the engine sucks because it was originally built as an MMO, now the engine sucks because it was originally built as a single player game... Can you guys plz get your f76 rants straight?
---
PC, sorry
---
It means she got booty.  But like, not a ten.
---
&gt;There are several Black Titanium ore deposits in the Belching Betty
---
Yeah, was just in there yesterday, damn.  Have to check it out again.
---
It’s good as team support vs sbq
---
Yeah its the players that are at fault here and not the developers that havent fixed this for so long.
---
All three of my characters (a shotgunner, a ranged sneak build and a heavy gunner) are primarily centered around not using Power Armor. I use a combination of White Knight + Lucky Break to keep my armor in order, and Rank 3 Fix It Good boosts their durability to 200% too, so my Combat Armor is nigh unbreakable. With BoS paint, Rank 5 Ironclad and a Protective Lining BOS Officer Suit, my DR is currently at over 400.
---
I also have the ability to equip all Combat Armor with Deep Pocketed, so I can run a carry weight of 275 without needing to equip perks to increase it artificially.  As a result of all these things, it doesn't really make sense for me to run Power Armor, except for extra radiation resistance in nuke zones.
---
similar thing just happened to me, except I got no notification that others were claiming it and a team of three guys hauled ass and killed me and this other guy who was helping me. stole all out shit then preceded to keep pvping us. keep in mind everyone was 100+ so we all one shot eachother except some fucker who was level 20 something and kept being the one that initiates the tagging. people are fucking assholes. didn't realize the pvp mechanic just allows the attacker to attack you without tagging if they weren't even claiming it. seems broken to me, let's dirtbags get stuff off unsuspecting people who don't know how a poorly explained game mechanic works. got like half my stuff back but these guys were just hurling insults and just being shitty people. didn't think people in the community were like this.  at least I know not to use workshops unless I don't have a bunch of junk I am keeping on me. thanks guys for clearing inventory tho I really needed space.
---
I'd love to but unfortunately I'm on PC :-(
---
Thanks for the explanation! I never really understood why I was running into enemies like twenty levels above me. They're not impossible to defeat, it's just a long, monotonous process.
---
&gt; It doesn't, it's a lie people keep repeating without any proof at all, if Bethesda's sole concern was with server performance tied to item quantity, they would have implemented a unique item cap, instead of weight.
---
&gt; My main group intentionally stored everything for days of Whitespring to test if it would make any difference and sat on a server on our storage mules together for hours (sorting out thousands of Legendary items/junk) doing anything we could think of to cause lag (trading, putting in and out of storage/containers, dropping etc) and the server handled it fine.
---
&gt; The only lag spikes we noticed were when starting trades and when first logging in, but those are purely on the clients end and doesn't impact others in the area/far away on the same server.
---
Blade of bastet 
---
Thank you! That's real kind of you
---
That sucks dude! Shit like that is a perfect example of why we need PvP servers!
---
Must be the 10th "Im now a beleiver" post in the last 12 hours. Bethesda running serious New Year damage control? Was the "Girl who killed the scorchbeast" step 1?
---
Mine appear red, allow me to kill for xp and loot them but they don't attack until I attack.
---
Maybe your game is damaging the robots somehow. You have telsa coils mods? Plague walker? 
---
I understand the pain that happens to me all the time
---
Nifty
---
You can find a yao guay in the parking near Philippi cemetery
---
I'll ask her in a little bit where she had it. Right now, for us at least, it's really early in the morning
---
As long as it's just for the game's health i wouldn't mind that.. though, guess I'm not seeing BTS fixing the problem anytime soon because I bet there are players that played legit and got those items
---
Tbh I am really tempted also, but as I have no time right now for that I also hate the fact that the devs let that slide in.. It's just not fair :(
---
Has some one ever said this was an MMO engine? I have never hear that one. It's trying it's best but it is barely a co-op engine and is being stretched to it's limits. When you have server crashes due to the number of items in your world, it's defiantly not because it is an MMO engine. This poor little thing is trying it's damn best to have a heartbeat.
---
I often appear naked in my friend's game when we're grouped.
---
Fair enough.
---
I'm almost 60 and just soloed my first nuke.  Was a fight, but not that hard.  Went through a lot of stims though.  Was up to about lvl 70 though as I did all the side quests leading up, and due to the weight glitches, pretty much walked around the entire map 2-3 times.  Tedious when you can't fast travel.  Finally got myself down to barely being able to fast travel, but I hate it.  Can't have all my favorite weapon choices and carry enough to repair things along the way.  Getting caps is a pain but you need them to bounce back and forth to get stash items and do repairs.
---
The whole weight/stash limits are ruining the game somewhat.  Yes, part of the FO history or gameplay, but that doesn't make it likable and seems worse here.
---
Thanks, just got back in and find out I have to complete the quest from the beginning that I had all most finished as well lol
---
Thanks! That's nice of you. I've got a bunch too, honestly, but can never seem to find the ones I need lol
---
Unless they hit other players and have pacifist off they will only take slap damage with the option that they can then turn around and use the guns to kill you for caps freely. It doesn't crash me and I've run that nuke zone dozens of times.
---
Nope, just a shared experience from a player. 
---
They will attack phenix (vendor) for no reason however he just kills them. 
---
Also for me they appear hostile but if I attack them they either ignore me or the 1 I attack attacks me back but they shouldn’t attack you on site  
---
Scrappin metal armor
---
I agree. This game is much better when we've got good people to play with. This community has been my favorite part about this game so far
---
Chaching
---
I found chally about 30 mins ago, I'm new so can't remember the name of the place but it was in the town for the part of the main quest where you had to collect samples of mole rats, feral ghouls, and wolves when studying the doctor's research.
---
No, I'll continue to play with my mule and if Bethesda decided to undo my 600 hours of hoarding I'd go ahead and have a refund on both my accounts, as EU law allows lol.
---
I've got at least a max rank of every perk and if you're suggesting I shouldn't be able to continue to hoard loot than what's the point in even logging in to play?
---
not sure if it's possible (since my luck with legendaries outside of armour is garbage) 
---
bloodied, furious, mutants ski sword 
---
(maybe swing speed instead mutants not sure which increases damage more since i have max martial artist)
---
&lt;Bethesda&gt; There is no way we can tell whether items in bulk were gained by duping or through legitimate play.
---
I’ve been getting this a lot lately as of 2 nights ago, was wondering if anyone else was getting it. It’s happening more frequently now too.
---
I noticed that yesterday. I killed a legendary assaultron and they all started firing at me.
---
Pretty sure it takes a solid 5 minutes for them to open their inventory so good hope their games crash everytime they try load their dupe character 
---
Awesome! We'll be sure to check that out!
---
there was a dude on here a few weeks ago arguing that "there needs to be a way to move caps out of circulation". 
---
Like what the hell are these people on? You're walking around a world of literally infinite resources, ripe for the selling, and AI traders that dole out a few thousand caps a day, and events spit out legendaries non-stop (looking at you uranium fever with your 3-5 legendary mole miners)
---
Something should be done about duping, but not because of a non-existent 'economy'. Something should be done because it would make the game less broken.
---
I started worrying about this last night after starting some inventory management and seeing my stash capacity at 602/600.  I didn't know where to begin looking for something taking me just 2lbs over.  Maybe a half hour later I saw it again, only it was 622/600.  I could remove items to get it under 600, but had no idea what was taking up the extra space.
---
Now I'm a little paranoid.  I want them to deal with dupers and exploits, but kinda don't want to get caught in a ban wave over something I have no control over like this.
---
Better start saving Caps now
---
Thanks mate, I'll check it out
---
Well the best way to get into PVP is to go to a workshop and attack it so you can kill its owner. So of course it's gonna attract anyone who as any interest at all in PVP.
---
Pour informations le système de salle des ventes est actuellement en place, plus de 1200 objets sont référencés, même si il reste encore beaucoup de travail, je travail aussi sur un système de recherche interne le plus performant possible, ainsi que la gestion des profils.
---
Je suis toujours à la recherche d'une personne pour traduire le site en anglais (ou dans d'autres langues), la base de données des objets est déjà traduit à partir des fichiers du jeu, il manque juste les fichiers lang du site.
---
Think a lot of people are missing the point of this post and instead focusing on the fact she's a girl. That's not why she got a platinum from me. 
---
I had to do the same thing. I bought 3 copies of the plans at level 15. Must've taken 40+ server hops total. I too am convinced the level cap is 20...
---
Just an FYI you can get to Wallace(?) at Harper's without fighting. Follow the outside of the train. You'll find an open carriage directly opposite the alleyway leading to him. Jump over the derailed car, job done. Might have to deal with the occasional swarm of invisible mutants/ghouls though...
---
the glowies are only there when the bomb has been dropped in ws before afaik. till wiped out.
---
My missile turrets used to wreck. Now something's changed and they won’t ever fire. I’ve tried experimenting with spotlights, no change. Maybe I have to move my base 
---
I'm the opposite, so far I can't get used to the real time VATS and hate it.  Hardly ever use it now.  For one I seem to get better first hits with my sneak perk damage vs VATS.
---
Well they're the ones getting all the upvotes with their two paragraph long stories of getting carried through Whitesprings tho
---
Sorry I don’t get the point of them doing so. The bounty comes out of the player cash. Why don’t they just give the cash to each other through trade?
---
This for sure.  But I'd suggest the hunting rifle over the combat rifle for sure. And once you hit higher levels the Gauss rifle is perfect. You'll definitely want to keep some higher ROF rifles on hands too because you'll lose sneak eventually, I like the radium/handmade/Tesla rifles. 
---
So you know what what bugs are.
---
Encumbrance is a design feature built into the game. It was the developer's intention for players who exceed their carry weight to move slower and not be able to fast travel. It is not the preferred way to play but it is an acceptable one, otherwise the developers would have implemented a hard cap.
---
As for my unrelated comment about developers not banning those who take advantage of their mistakes, I still stand by that. Unless you're using a cheat engine, then no. I don't think you should be banned for doing something that's unintended, even if your abusing a bug.
---
That doesn't mean I condone duping, or that it shouldn't be fixed. 
---
It should.
---
I just don't think banning players is the answer, especially for something that happens even when you're not trying.  I've had power armor duplicate on it's own, my base doubles itself almost every time I move it, I've had phantom outfits appear in my inventory. I get disconnected or my game crashes every hour or so. If you're only concern is to ban "dupers", then you're also bound to get people who aren't doing anything malicious, and are just trying to put up with this buggy mess of a game. 
---
This is just stupid. There is just no need to have that many of any of those.

30, F, married. I'm a very casual player. I love exploring and taking workshops. But once Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out I wont be on as much.
---
I would offer but I’m afraid it would t be much fun as I can 1-2 hit most mobs in the game
---
Oh I didn't go solo, I just play with the best morons around. At one point a friend was being chased by Mirelurks and when we looked there were like 20 chasing him

On xbox the bumpers jump the slider about 15%, holding them is faster than the stick/d-pad.  I'd imagine its R1/L1 on PS4

Send the screenshot with the name to Bethesda

It’s not a game breaking bug. The game is still very playable
---
I have never encountered it de-cloak from shooting with just 1 piece and silencer is extremely helpful to let you stay undetected.
---
also explains why at level 80 plus watoga and enclave bunker seem to have the same inventory every single day ( that damn marine ultra light build)
---
Ive played more than 1500 hours of fallout 4 and 150 in 76 and i had no idea this item existed. The wrapped cap makes a lot more sense now though...
---
(I have the cap in 76 if you're looking for that too)
---
I de-cloak all the time from single shots but that might be the Gauss Rifle too. And my girl is running a Silenced full auto so guessing that not helping. 
---
wait so vendor inventorys are shared between players?
---
i thought strength is only 4-5% increase in damage whereas mutants gives 10%? so wouldn't mutants be better if you didn't care about the extra carry
---
Getting all of the armor improvements for a single type of underarmor can cost something like 3-4k caps.
---
PC, Kaijudospartan, level 102 main and level 20 alt.
---
I really hope we see PvE servers in the near future. As someone who enjoys PvP in every game Ive played, I cant stand it in Fallout and I just want it gone. Its one of the worst thought out PvP systems Ive ever seen in any game ever.
---
Bags of concrete are all over the place, not sure about the gnomes but they are all over the place too. Plenty of concrete camp sites and workshops.
---
Imagine having level 25000 and whenever you die in pvp you lose all your caps :x
---
Its the Phillippi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
But you can’t have mutants and instigating, and I think instigating is by far the better option. 
---
I believe the only increase is through the perk cards 
---
If you place the armour down in the world, it's marked as yours, can't be touched and will get sucked back into your inventory after about 2 minutes if you don't enter it - but if you simply drop it, it loses the ownership and becomes  up for grabs by anyone.
---
This is why you don't see it on display in camps and such, there's no way to safely store it out in the open.
---
Gauss is great for a lot of things though. I have mine with prime capacitors so it sits on 1750 damage + bonus to scorched. Because of the slow rate of fire it doesn't burn through the expensively crafted prime ammo too quickly. I'm not in game right now, but my handmade does 500 something damage and can probably be fired a bit over 3x as fast as the gauss so gauss is probably better dps on queen with the scorched bonus. I use handmade on pretty much everything but big mobs though.
---
I found a few at watoga station from the vendor. Was server hopping to see what he had and they popped up. Motion assist servos was one, think explosive vent was the other?
---
Thnx!
---
I also have no interest in chems, don't use em don't need em (except for the day tripper, whilst the song "day tripper" from the beatles is playing, ofcourse).

Hack, Lockpick, cook, build, explore, event grind, nuke zone grinding, random bullshitting with friends.

&gt; brigading
---
Where exactly do you believe we're being sent from?
---
My issue has been the OP suggesting that anyone with an item stack exceeding 100k should be banned, when many of us have over that in certain Ammo/Junk on our storage mules.
---
Note: We're not talking about 100k Bobbleheads or 10m Nukas, we're talking about Ammo/Steel Scrap.
---
&gt; Everyone opposed to a Witch hunt must be a WITCH!
---
I feel I've earned mine. I've farmed and sold a lot of good weapons and have probably been disadvantaged by the dupe affected economy more than I have advantaged from it.
---
ah ok yeah my luck with legendary weapons is pants so not sure which combos can happen together
---
TSE. There's no reason to use anything else in the game, unless you want to hinder yourself.
---
My rifle does 1,700 damage and one shots almost every enemy in the game.
---
Personally, I would try to use less of the fast fire rate guns since that causes quite a bit on player/server instability (on consoles at least). 
---
Curious as well.  I’ve only been to that fight once and there were about 7 others there.  I burned through 750+ rounds of 5.56 and her hp barely moved.  I hopped out.  No point using all my ammo on any single mob.  
---
Plus a SB on the finish for most. Hide in the elevator, open door, spray bullets crazy, close door, and try and reload before robots come through the door, rinse and repeat. 
---
Yeah, basically anything short of standing around. 
---
I play non PA with unyielding armor my resistance is like 512/512/0 solo in a group of 4 I’m at 601ish.
---
Unyielding makes your stats really high I have about 34 str/25agi/20ish luck/everything else is above 12.
---
My bloodied fist weapon dmg is at 1300 base add adrenaline Scorch beasts melt. I use enforcer perk and a shotgun to make them land.
---
The downside is nukezones. Hazmat and power armor suits have special hidden perks that reduce incoming radiation. One guy stacked his rad resistance to 3000 in regular armor and he still took 7/sec. you’ll have to jump in power armor or hazmat to farm nuke zones.
---
But  my build I can easily swap between two handed/fist.
---
If you use black powder that’ll last you the whole fight because of the reload time lol
---
Just saw a guy cheating with a Jetpack mod. No PA, just T-posing as he shoots into the air with the sound effect
---
Well I'm level 30 and level 47 trillion my rifle does 30 damage
---
People would just craft armor pieces then or some other item to crash their characters.
---
Not me, but I'm sure there are many; perhaps not in this sub, though.
---
Ok still no luck it is in a post where some one is talking about their ticket to have a X0-1 jetpack armor chest piece restored. The response was that Bethesda will be able to restore it after the winter break but it will take time to review the data from his account. He was asked for an approximate time and date for his log in. because the chest piece just wasn't there when he logged in.   
---
Some one called bull shit on it so he posted a screen shot of the request.   
---
The guy that call bull shit was like WTF because he was told that no such system existed when his item went missing. so he contacted Bethesda with his ticket number too. They informed him that they were sorry but at the time of his ticket they system was not in place. 
---
I love when people come attack the ammo factory after I locked it down. Free stuff for me.

Oh my sweet summer child

Have the wrapped cap, thank you though. I have 1 friend that says they've seen a player with it, and there are corpses with it on. That's all I have to go on though.

I got the BOS paint to fxxk y’all talking about

Do you have any proof to suggest I'm a "duper and exploiter"?

I would be included in what multiple people on this thread have suggested should be criteria for mass banning.

Gatling gun, very ammo efficient on the 5mm ammo. Alternatively, help out with an endangernol stronger and melee when she comes down (power attack the head)

And I play pretty much the same way you do, and I'm a 67yr old man whose been a gamer since the late 80's

The other day I saw two people around level 20 taking a workshop in cranberry bog. I rather enjoyed watching them from a distance with my binoculars, then sneaking in behind bushes and through shacks in the little town they were in. At one point I was crouched hiding in the bushes literally like 10 feet away from them and they had no clue I was there. My character looks crazy too, engineer uniform, deathclaw, sack hood with straps. I planned my attack (not that I needed to) ran up and activated the workshop. Before they even knew what was happening I turned around and swiped at them both and they both went down in one hit, took about 3 seconds in all. I can just imagine the ruckus on discord of them being like "WTF? Whats happening?" And as quickly as I brewed this chaos it ended and I just ran off (I dont need their junk, but I always check in case they are dupers because then Ill take every scrap they have and run it into a fissure site).
---
I don't trade, I don't trust anything to not be a dupe, and I only buy plans from vendors and they can't be sold by players.  No dupers are going to benefit from me.  The game is giving me a pretty nice array of weapons, and as I spend all my caps on plans, and hunt every corner of the map for them, by the time I am high enough level to care, I should be able to make sweet customs until the game coughs up a keeper.
---
Tse .50 cal. Eats her hp nom nom
---
TSE lever action and TSE combat shotgun
---
I felt the exact same way about people stealth boy, super sledging my ass. At least now I have a chance. 
---
The missle turrets are the worst. Watched 5 scorched walk right in front of them and nothing, I ended up removing all my turrets so that I habe a bigger budget and just ended up building a nicer house,  I'd just occasionally step out once in a while to kill those annoying mobs
---
I have deathclaw spawn under my base. I think it's guaranteed.
---
[Location here](https://imgur.com/a/BWsWKX8)
---
Here's the thing though. Apparently having duplicating so many items causes servers issues and can bring a server to crash. They also seems to stop you from moving on a very long period of time if you trade with one of them.
---
Secondly it ruins the economy of the game completely and they get a unfair advantage over other player. 
---
How is any of this not game breaking?
---
Im on a similar spot with mine - theyre still early teens (with one actually becoming a teen next month). I spoil the little brats with weapons, armor, and components and nope. Nothing. They dont play fo with me anymore. When the last one was about done with the game i gave him an explosive minigun to see if he would stick with it some more but no. 
---
Can someone tell me how I seen a friendly scorchbeat yesterday,flying around the bog,is it actually possible to befriend it? Any mutants that came up it killed them and didn't harm me,i was happy as ever just can't figure it out,
---
&gt; They share mods with light and sturdy metal parts
---
from scrapping them?
---
Met a guy who duped the other day. He told me he honestly doesn't care about getting banned because you can find the game for 10$ now pretty much. So he has 5 accounts just waiting if they actually ban.
---
Do you want to use normal armor or power armor? For normal armor heavy metal (dr), heavy leather (er) and scout (mixed) are the best options defensive wise but in most cases you should prefer pieces with decent legi effects (sentinel for example) over higher dr/er. Rr is weak in normal armor anyway since you're missing the hidden buff from hazmat/pa.
---
For pa your choices would be lvl 50 t51b (best dr/er), ultracite ( 2nd bestdr, decent rr) and lvl 50 X01(2nd best er, best rr, highest stat total).
---
It's been a hobby of mine for weeks, but players just disconnect or server hop. They should adjust the timer, or make the radius not visible until like 30s? to touchdown. Even better would be your character/camp is forced to stay for a certain amount of time, since even in pvp incidents players just pansy out when they are in a losing scenario.
---
Deaths has such a low consequence, but the player base is full of 'quick-save gods' that are not used to losing.
---
Still fun make their base an event on the map.
---
25k per character... 5 characters per account.  A HARD cap on caps of 125k.
---
lvl 226... 2 full bank alts.. 15k on me.
---
I buy the last plans I can't find... weapons / armor I want to test out... basically nothing from vendors that isn't a super rare mod/plan... a little fast travel caps here and there.
---
Want to play more with other people but feel I get taken the wrong way or overly friendly. 🙈feel I spook people away sometimes. That makes interaction especially in this game difficult 
---
Yup this. Holding a workshop is meh. I mean it is nice to come back and get some free stuff but I'm generally encumbered and my stash is full so.... What's the point? I don't even mind the like vs like PvP, but some of the PvP seems to be "ah now I can kill you without getting a bounty" 
---
I hate to be that guy, but arent you literally using the internet to ask this and therefore have virtually all human knowledge ever accumulated literally at your fingertips?
---
Its asinine that people dont just use google when wondering about these things! :)
---
They are there to assist you in the resource grind. Can also be used to get xp through the wave defense system. That's it really at least to me.
---
I like the fact that it encourages PvP. What I don't like is how PvP as a whole is being done in the game.
---
Yes but also from other sources. If you have a mod for combat armor(for example), it is usable for all 3 weight classes(light, sturdy, heavy)
---
It’s going from PC to Xbox lol when you’re used to a game a certain way, you have to learn it again for Xbox...use VATS- I find that saves my butt more often... or switch to a character that is part melee fighter, that helps too. My characters so far have all been sniper/swordsman 🤣🤣
---
Don't you just love the ignore tag? 
---
Sounds like kids that whine in GTA online. You blew up my cargo/car/ect. Your not entitled to do anything you want with out any push back. It's a game called grand theft auto.... Same goes for fo76. It's an apocalypse fighting for resources... That other people need.
---
A coin purse and a chew stick?
---
Why would such a fake hypocrite like you trigger anyone? I provide proof of my legitimacy to my customers if they ask for it. 
---
You are just spreading lies. Lol.
---
This! Also, it is a great way to earn money and levels for lower level players. Since it is free to hop between workshops you own, you can capture 3 or 4 of them and then just fast travel around doing the Defend events and rake in the loot until you have had enough.
---
I got 453 tokens, I bought the head first, had 153 left and the suit was not there for me to buy, am I still doing something wrong? 
---
Not online rn but ill be on later tonight
---
Sometimes spotlights just don’t work either... I use spotlights all the time but I’ve still had the situation you describe
---
How do you get the resources though? I unlock them then what do I do?
---
Yeah I love mine for lower level trash mobs
---
So I'm gonna guess your still in the beginning of playing. Late game you will start getting a surplus but early on it will get eaten. On this I can recommend the hunting rifle then switch to chosen weapon group after you start obtaining perk cards for it. Or rely heavily on throw ables. 
---
It's okay! Thank u tho :)
---
They do i have chameleon serum recipe from sb Queen. But man, i killed thet shit like 100times and got only this one. RNG hates me.
---
More posts like this please
---
as said, you need 300 tokens in your possession for the suit to show up. That's the reason it is told in the guide to buy the suit before the head.
---
Basic enemies give lower xp. For example a feral ghoul gives low xp but a bloated or charred gives a lot.
---
Same thing happened to me a couple of days ago: "I have emailed the footage to Bethesda I hope you like writing essays they make hackers do them go look at the front page, they're looking at the footage now so there will be no confusion on if you're hacking or not so we will see ya later guy"
---
I mean I understand the two shot explosive is OP but I didn't know it also doubles as a Jimmy Rustler 10/10
---
Okay:) np !
---
There’s in-game messaging now? Fascinating, how did I miss this?
---
Depends, what type of weapon do you use? Automatic, Semi-Auto or Bolt-Action. They drain different amounts of ammo. And it depends on how you use it. Commandos and Heavys drain the most ammo for obvious reasons. The least ammo is needed for a Sniper (Meeles still use less, duh).
---
Get a melee backup. Also, certain enemies are tougher/higher levels, they'll always take more rounds. For the most part, faces are weak points. Except robots. Robots are assholes and you shoot em in the eyestalk or the stomach (Mr. Gutsy and Protectron accordingly.) Perks help a lot. If there's a weapon you like, equip the corresponding card to deal more damage with that weapon type (pistols, shotguns, automatic and non automatic rifles.) Also VATS is helpful in some/most situations for hitting enemies.
---
You get more items from event rewards than show on screen, thats where your purified water, stimpaks and mats are coming from.
---
Shouldn't have told him that. 
---
I gonna assume you know how to build at a camp you do the same as at your camp except there is a tab called resources and it will have a list of available nodes at that location. Then you need to power them aswell.
---
Eye crie 😪
---
It is there sometimes though I think it mostly happens when someone fast travels you can see their icon zoom across the map.
---
But if they are 100 levels higher? Game on. Fast travel over, Stealth boy, normal Dragon or black powder rifle to the head. instakill. By the time they come back, the Dragon is reloaded for a more even matchup but it is fun few minutes of running around until one of us gets tired and realizes that they really didnt need that workshop that bad after all!
---
Furious on the heavy weapons is pretty good when she's down. Kind of hard to miss her when she's not moving.
---
How much do you want for them?
---
Thiz needs to get some viewage there are alot of places that need this and a main quest definatly needs it.
---
Just like level locked SBQ
---
what % health are you running at to get that though?
---
Sometimes they attack me when I load in. Not sure what the problem is though.
---
Any rifle or pistol is fine. As soon as theres a red nuke zone on the fissure many players swarm down to get a shot at the sbq. Sbq probably already dead by the time you arrive. Decontamination shower arc is basically only worthwhile sbq reward.
---
Yeah, I'm just stuck and it's frustrating going about anywhere just to encounter level 60 glowing bullshit with 20 diseases

4) I am unable to connect any wires in my camp. I've relogged and everything. It still keeps saying that I have no budget for power lines. If this is the issue then power lines should be worth nothing of your budget
---
I’ve lost quests a bunch of times ... the way I fix it is to quit to desk top and on the Bethesda launcher do a scan and repair ... works every time
---
Certain depots have resources in the ground i.e. lead, aluminum, oil, etc. When you go into the build option (where you can place walls, defences, generators) there is a specific tab for Resource Extractors. They snap into place well enough when you select the corresponding extractor for the resource hole. Then slap generators down, wire em together and you should be good to go.
---
I have my ultracite armour in my stash and have zero worries,I wouldn't risk such minty armour if there was a single insecurity
---
can confirm the two grafton vendors (Station and the one in the city) have the plans, you need to try often while playing/server hop though as they are kinda rare. :)
---
How would you counter someone who just shows up and insta gibs you with slap damage? I'm not gonna waste my time dealing with someone who can immediately kill me regardless of what armor I have. A TSE shotgun with a long barrel has enough range to one shot with slap damage from across the river at Harper's ferry. That is absolutely absurd. Try to go into a nuke zone to get some quick xp and maybe a new legendary or two, and at least half a dozen people are blowing crowds up with their TSE shotgun. It's not really possible to have PvP when it mostly comes down to who shoots first and then it's over.
---
At the foot of the rappel tower, right on the chicken icon on the map
---
If you got banned, you broke T&amp;C.  Buying from the unlicenced vendor is one of them.
---
Downvote me all you want.
---
No, simply following the conversation does. 
---
It'd be impossible to be banned erroneously as I and many other commenters already said.
---
Yeah I’ll take a look at that later. Man I love the game. Jank and all
---
Depends on the enemy.  Super mutants are ace, even at low levels.  I did a run at level 22 last night if the Charleston Capital building and got boat loads of xp cause it was all super mutants.  They were mostly level 5 with a few level 10 in there, but there are hundreds of them and for some reason they all come to you when you kill one with a non silenced weapon.
---
I've encountered that in a few places to be honest, interior areas that killing one mob causes the entire areas mobs to run to you.  Shotgun and sniper and they all go down.  Charleston Capital building, the place with mother lode spring to mind.
---
Charleston Capital building is great cause there is so much typewritery goodness in there too.
---
Since your level is rising (even readable in the STATS screen) with a fancy „Level up“ display on screen even when NOT spending your points in a SPECIAL attribute I guess, OPs irritation is understandable. 
---
I noticed it first time also with my 2nd character. First char is lvl 80 and I had no clue. But with my 2nd I thought, since there are level-requirements on a Perk card that I just need to hit that level. Do I started to save the SPECIAL points till I hit the reauired level, just to see that the cards aren’t available. So I figured the same out by my own. Literally, even when saving your points it’s not possible to be reach a decent end-level-Build at lvl 50. 70-80 maybe.
---
I'm of course talking about non-dupers.
---
My dozen or so workshops reflect your findings. People use it as an excuse for non bounty griefing. I prefer helping other people out with the defence events.
---
I honestly wonder if anyone would have said anything if there was no PvP in the game. It serves no purpose. 
---
You should check out an anime called Hi Score Girl. 
---
I'm on mobile too, bud, and I have never made that mistake. Maybe next time you feel like running your mouth, pay closer attention to what you're even running your mouth about. 
---
Nope there is no saving anything in this system. you can make a decent OP melee build at level 50 but it really shines at level 65-70. most good build are done at level 70 TBH.
---
Sounds more like a internet problem rather than a Bethesda one ...
---
Yeah, I've had a couple of players come to help me once or twice and it's always nice to see the good members of the community.
---
Is there a list somewhere of what event drops what? Would be good to know
---
Rushing endgame? Within the first week after release some people already had 100+ hours in this game. Wouldn't be surprised if some people already have 1000 hours ingame. (And somehow some people still say everybody above lvl 100 used an exp exploit...) This is an online game *and* a fallout game it is kinda expected that many people nolife the game and since most location are disappointingly small you have the whole map explored within a relatively short time (considering the fact that the map has 4 times the size of fo4 but the same amount, if not less content...)
---
Same here. I got lucky and the robots decided to attack the SB instead so I saved on ammo and stimpacks.
---
1/3 sometimes more the advantages kick in at 50%. 
---
The only thing that is dangerous for me is not timing your block when you fight a deathclaw/bear/etc because that will stun you for a few seconds
---
Poison from queen or scorchbeast.
---
glowing ghoul radiation attacks because you have no rad resist. The explosive shotgun I carry also servers for the glowing fat ghouls. Or I pop 1 Radaway and one shot them with my fist but you’ll end up taking some like 129rad dmg in one swing. I learned though if you back peddle and swing wild they will run into your fist and might not hit you.
---
Oh ok, that’s kinda dumb, thanks anyway :) 
---
Dense would be the preferred mod. 
---
Its not a chicken, it's a pheasant. :)
---
Only weapon plans I ALWAYS find are radium an rail rifle. Lvl 98. Wish i knew about handmade plans before lvling up.
---
&gt;*Edit* Not really concerned anymore looks like they are tracking inventory size at connect and disconnect and using this long break to gather data so they are looking into it and will be fixing the problem! *Edit*
---
Big if true, can you share a source? 
---
Then you are noob. I have friend with legit level 300+ and he could have 100levels more if we were doing whitespring farm instead of ghouls. Bcos queen + event is 500+1200xp. That is three ghouls lol.
---
So yeah i belive 500level is real at this time for some crazy nolifer.

Oh sorry, I was too sensitive, apologies ;)

---
Reached level 76 in Skyrim before speaking to the grey beards. Play fallout the exact same way, I love the discovery
---
How is my title bait? It leads into exactly what I'm talking about.
---
New players (which this game needs) will be rapidly turned off when they aren't able to get far in the main quest due to this.  
---
I've patiently decided to hold off on main story quests for the time being until I can deal with the super high level mobs being spawned by high level players in main quest areas.  Many other new players won't.
---
Great read and well done. 50 year old gamer here. Glad you are keeping going. My son's play a lot but don't like 76 so I play 100% solo. 
---
if you using heavy weapons like 50 cal or minigun, don't shoot queen in a while flying. queen will be staggering in sky, and didn't landing. especially it's worse if you have perks like staggering effect. she has damage reduction while flying. and you will be waste your bullets. 
---
Joining the enclave is easy, it begins at the Abandoned waste dump located rightest side of map. Search a body and a death claw heap... Youtube enclave videos show how its done. Boot camp is easy.
---
That wasn't speculation, stupid, I was asking what the fuck your point was. You didn't have one, clearly, or you'd have stated it by now.
---
There are a group of people who play not wanting to engage in pvp and workshops are a good source of specific resources. The issue with workshops is that they don't cater for those players at all. I set up a good base at Charleston and got attacked by two people. One was crouched with chameleon sniping me with a two shot and the other had an explosive shotgun. I'm fine with pvp so played along as long as I could but had to leave. My whole session was spent fending off those two as I didn't want to lose the base I'd spent time and resources setting up.
---
If you see me online hmu if you need help doing something. Psn is the same.
---
Not only that the mantra of "modders always fix it" only until the last what 2-3yrs only applied to the PC side of things which frankly has a far smaller population of gamers. 
---
I will never understand cheating at online games.
---
You can't feel a sense of accomplishment.
---
Everyone knows you cheated, so no one respects you.
---
You have no goals to aim for because you cheated your way through and dont need goals... so, what's the point of even touching the game to begin with?
---
The Somerset special is a pretty good weapon for the first 30-40 levels even. 
---
It feels like armor is really fucking low dmg/hit weapons over royally, because there's a bit of a sweet spot when ranged weapons suddenly start working again (It's about 40ish dmg/hit), lower if you can combine it with armor piercing effects from legendaries or perk cards. Below that threshold (around lvl 35+) it quickly feels like you are just throwing cotton balls at things.
---
Note: Ranged also HEAVILY profits from sneak crits and VATS ( if you have the perk cards ). So it takes more effort to build a good ranged set but it will pay off extremely well. And the fun part: Even with no perks in melee you can still suit up in Power Armor, grab your super sledge and go efficiently into melee.
---
Just bad luck, server hop and you might find more.
---
If I'm  not mistaken the railway rifle counts as a heavy weapon, many heavy weapons have extreme recoil *but* the perk "stabilized" isn't only the 2nd best armor pen perk but also reduces the recoil of hw noticably (try to use a plasma gatling without it....)
---
Right here bro am on ps4 
---
  It happens in Destiny 2, and virtually any other similar game. It's not just Youtubers either, and with 76 in the state it's in right now I doubt Bethesda have the time to stop it. People WILL cheat, sad but true.
---
I don't see that mentioned for other factions so the Cryolator seems to be bound to Free States/Wallace...  it was the Ski Sword that I know I saw early on that got me curious but there's other weapon plans besides the Handmade affected by this.
---
A (likely duped) TSE handmade that everyone seems to be selling - got mine for 12k 3 weeks ago.  Best caps I’ve ever spent as it improved ammo efficiency by hundred folds.  1 bullet can kill sever clustered mobs.
---
Here on Reddit there is a post about a guy that had his X01 chest piece disappear when he logged in. He put a ticket in and they told him that it could be restored after the winter break. Someone else posted bull shit so he posted a screenshot and his ticket number. 
---
The guy that called bull shit had a similar thing happened at the beginning of December and a ticket too. He contacted support again and apologized that unfortunately that his item could not be restored due to the fact that the system was only recently added to track character inventory at login and out. 
---
I’m guessing that would have to of been in the last patch. And would be a valid way to collect data and even show trends to ensure you don’t band random people. In addition you could even build an algorithm to look through the data and auto ban people I’m guessing.

It's a little funky about crediting you at times, but killing legendary enemies also counts towards the 10/10 points, each is worth a point. 
---
I appreciate the helpful reply :)
---
Why would anyone pay money for two shot explosives? Like why? There's a billion of them due to the duping which means they should be a few hundred caps not fifty dollars. 
---
  This game is pretty easy as is. Unless you have no clue what you're doing and are just throwing perks into random crap, you're rarely gonna die. You don't even need a good legendary weapons and you should be able to get decent legendary armor pieces that up your survivability a lot. Like even one effect of protection against robots or super mutants helps a lot.
---
  You'll struggle against scorch beasts until you're a higher level with a focused build, but they're supposed to be the hardest things in game. Every time the queen event starts it gets splattered by an orbital strike that does like 80% of its hp for some reason and that's just one of at least ten people that will show up to fight it so it's not like you need a god tier weapon for it. 
---
 Hell, enforcer lvl 1 breaks the game already. As soon as you can take it, you can completely disable anything in the game except maybe the flatwoods alien from what I hear. One perk investment and a shotgun and you can literally disable behemoths, deathclaws, assaultron dominator, scorch beasts, wendigos and mirelurk queens. 
---
  Pvp is stupid in this game so it's not like they can go on a Whiterun style killing spree with their TSE since there's usually like ten people spread out across the map that have to fire back to begin with. I don't know why anyone thinks a TSE is worth more then a few thousand caps if there wasn't any duping to begin with. 
---
For science!
---
Will try now thx
---
I'm thinking it's not as big a longshot as you assune, I just don't think it's a frequent topic of conversation is all. 
---
Now that's really interesting, so in the end all you need is invested 6 INT to have a crafter char.
---
It would be helpful if you showed the Leaded mod changes as well.  Great idea to do this though.
---
The civil war museum has them and many other amazing outfits
---
I was hoping my capture would get their tag but it wasn't set to a long enough time. Corrections have been made.
---
For real. I'm level 110 and I always have between 400-1000 shotgun shells. I'd be amazed if it took me more than 5 shells to kill someone with my tse. And if they were really duping I'm sure they'd have much better weapons.
---
I anyone "ever" gets Jetpack or stealth boy plans  for it, let us know, i still am 100% convinced it doesn't exist, calibrated shock does :)
---
Yeah, that definitely happened.
---
I had one guy try and take over Grafton Steel one day, didn't actually realize it at the time because I was also fighting off super mutants at the same time. He and his buddy had taken over the munitions factory earlier when I had it, but I just let them take it because I, again, was in the middle of something I'm sure seemed important. He came after me, and started attacking me and I figured it was just a super mutant beating me with a sledgehammer, but it was some dude in a suit and a gas mask. I killed him about 4 or 5 times before his buddy joined in, and they managed to take me down, only after shooting multiple mini nukes, and using several stealth boys. They didn't claim the workshop, just went on their merry way, happy they had a good fight I suppose. Later on that same server, we fought a queen and they were there, I just waved to them and went on my way after we killed that damn queen
---
??? You get bonus durability from Int, it’s the same as the bonus durability from perks like weapon artisan. You didn’t see that when you did your tests? When I craft on my 5 Int character, the bonus is noticeably less than if my 15 Int character crafts something.

Lol. Last night I (level 56) went to the Overseer camp to drop off some supplies and duplicate plans. Usually, when I am there I make a full set of either level 1 or level 5 upgraded leather plus a hunting rifle all decked out depending on the level of people around there. This time I didn't see anyone so I made all level 1 stuff, but before I could put it in the box, a level 2 came up and took everything. It took me a good 5 minutes of shooting, pointing, crouching, emoting, jumping, looking, meleeing the box, etc. to get that dang person to come back and look in the box. Aaaargh! How are you going to survive the wilderness if you can't take a hint!!! (-;
---
The boards are actually key to the duping process
---
Haha, the UNFALLOUT Fan should see this because they think the server is laggy and not stable well they shoul atleast know this, i have encoutered 13 errors and 5 disconnects in 1 day im serious and i already know who actually does this because i kinda watch duplication video but i havent done it yet (i simply reply at fallout 76 videos about duplicating that they should stop duping so thats why i know) my lvl 95 is a hardwork never done a duplicating except in Terraria haha
---
I don't doubt exploiters break Bethesda's TOS, but EU law doesn't care about some random companies TOS and when I've looked previously, I've not been able to find any precedent for a companies TOS actually being enforced in a court.
---
Even if you want to forward that a TOS is a binding contract (good luck with that), all established precedent suggests that the ability for Bethesda to modify the terms of the agreement at any time makes the entire contract void. 
---
Harris v. Blockbuster, Inc. would be a good place to start if you're interested.
---
Specifically, this is what means it's not an enforceable contract:
---

ZeniMax may modify these Terms of Service at its sole discretion at any time, by posting the revised version at http://www.zenimax.com/legal_terms or upon other notice to You.

---
Furthermore, more specifically in the EU (since that's what the comment was about), the Consumer Rights Act absolutely would allow you to get a refund, since the "repair or replacement" clause would be "significantly inconvenient" and could therefore be skipped. It's exactly how I'll get my refund if they add P2W to the Atom shop.
---
I don't think it's you spooking people as much as it's an online game based on games that were exclusively solo for decades, there's a large chunk of people that play 76 (myself included) that aren't terribly interested in being social while they do it. So yeah, I don't think it's anything you're doing wrong, man, a lot of us are just anti-social creeps 😋
---
It seems to be a pretty popular farm spot, given that I often catch other people doing it.
---
There's a military ammo bag in the APC near the barracks. Some mil grade duct tape outside the left barracks on a box. An ammo bag inside that same barracks on the table in back. There's usually one ammo bag inside the main building on the counter behind where you get the uniform. There's one upstairs on a rolling trolley right outside the stairwell.
---
Screws are split between the commie detection building  and the main one

Springs are all in the main building.
---
Tbh 2handed weapons are already one of the strongest weapon classes (if not the strongest if you ignore legendary guns *cough* tse *cough*). Even if it feels wonky that you only hit 1 target, they would need to nerf the dmg significantly otherwise.
---
Hey ppl im level 70, finished all main quests and been helping low levels through tough areas. Add me if you need help. 
---
ps4: paulofg1980
---
In no way to disparage your generousity, I'm one of those types of people who you've probably seen ignore you/run away.
---
Despite being an online game, I still prefer to treat it mostly as a solo experience, wanting to explore at my own pace and earn my gear through my own efforts, going so far as to server hop if there's other people running through the area I'm going through.
---
But that's just my miserly take, there's plenty of others who would appreciate your efforts if they realised what you're doing!
---
yep, you CAN hide from then when you break line of sight and cloak, but they will always hover above you. Overall the Scorchbeasts always moves towards players
---
Poor game mechanic that people intentionally exploit 
---
Yeah they don't need banned damn Bethesda letting bugs happen it's their fault that people "make" the choice to cheat when the know it's wrong
---
But it's definitely Bethesda fault 
---
I'm being sarcastic they deserve fucking banned and all their stuff reset back to level 1 with a 50% decrease in all loot and xp gain 
---
Yeah they are super rare, been trying to get them myself for several days, more difficult then usual because his route is absolutely huge and trying to find him is a pain.
---
Yo I'd kill to get one of those. And I'd be happy to give you some caps for your time.
---
I have better luck when it's not nuked tbh. Less competition and on a side note I've never had my tse crash the server.
---
You’re welcome! This is my group bloodied 2h melee build. The 3 points in makeshift you don’t really need you could put it in charisma for other effects like party boy or somewhere else
---
No, I mean the obvious green ferns that are the main focus of the photo.
---
I feel your pain. Level 62 here
---
I assume everyone with 3 Int+ can outdo that bonus with rank 3 weapon artisan / fix it good.
---
There’s just no logical explanation. 
---
I was just trying to comment on how unbalanced most of the weapons in this game are. And how much work some one has to put in just to make one of this worth a damn.
---
i just started and now level 5. May I know whats special with owning a workshop?
---
What a great story. My dad passed 5 or so years back. Some of the best memories of my father were waking up at 3:00 A.M. to him still trying to beat a level of Lemmigs 3D on the PS1 (he loved games by Psygnosis). I wish I had been able to play this with him I think he would have liked it.
---
I want to say it was the severe receiver.
---
lol at all the downvotes on imgur
---
Yesterday was going for my first nuke and had worked my way through Alpha solo, dying four or five times figuring out how everything works, and getting blasted by double assaultron blasts. I'm in the process of going to the key card machine and "You have been disconnected". I rushed back into the game knowing what the result was going to be but still had to look. So I get back in and go down the elevator to see a completely spawned silo :( That is a extremely frustrating thing to happen.
---
Gt?
---
I doubt it's working as intended. It seems that as we level up the vendor's loot pool gets replaced each time with the higher tier, instead of just combing into one big pool. 
---
Sometimes you get made ultra more-deaded. 
---
In DND you actually have to reach -10hp before your character actually physically dies. I just assume it's something similar here. 
---
You come and go,
---
You come and go.
---
Yup. Take it over, defend it, profit. I’m still working to level 50 so the xp helps too.
---
...and this is why I don't really play fo76 anymore.
---
It's unfortunate, because aside from the rampant duping and associated crashes, the game is rather fun.  You reach a point though, after the main story has been told, where what's left is generally ruined by other folks swooping in with (largely duped) TSE weapons, trivializing shared content.
---
Ah well.
---
It increases the durability in 2 different ways.  First off, you should understand that each item of a specific type and level has a base minimum and maximum durability.  So for example, lets say a Lv.1 Leather arm has 30 minimum durability and 40 max; when crafted, you could get a version that has anywhere from 30 to 40 durability.  The higher your Intelligence the easier it is to craft items at the max durability, so 40 in the example.
---
The 2nd thing it does, is it starts adding bonus durability.  The highest Intelligence I have on any character so far is 8 and crafted items seem to have about 1/3rd(going by length of the secondary bar) of their extra durability.  I'm not sure if 15 INT would allow your crafted items to be crafted with 100% extra durability, or not(doesn't quite look like it right now).
---
Also, Luck does the same as the first half, but when finding items, and also determines how much current durability they have, which is a roll that seems to range from 0% to 100% of the durability, with higher Luck giving you a better chance to get items at their max, base durability cap and at higher % of durability left.
---
Sorry if this is confusing, I'm not all that good at explaining things.
---
Thank you for the offer, Im PC
---
When PvP isn't balanced and you know it, and you then use the fact that it isn't balanced to your advantage in order to grief other people, you are a bully. That is what bullies do. That is the definition of bully. If you don't want to be a bully, don't be a bully. If you enjoy that, then have fun while it lasts. From what Bethesda said in their last statement it sounds to me like PvP-less servers are coming soon.
---
You may have an interested customer then sir.
---
A DnD reference on a fallout board. You have my upvote.
---
yeah
---
This, workshops give loads of exp from the events. 
---
What i did was do the workshops near the poseidon power plant, you get the power up event, the capture workshop event and the defend workshop event all in one location. 
---
Resources is mainly the reason to pick them up. You don't gain xp off building things anymore. But they do have periodic events to protect them for rewards (plans). Another reason to use them would be fast travel (what I use them for). Setup one to get back to the other side of the map if you are jumping alot.
---
Key workshops would be energy plants. If you do the quest or someone has already. There will be power boxes that give 100 power, (not sure if it's 100) at each workshop tied to that energy plant.
---
Oh it's sad when a baby throws a tantrum. Obviously not old enough to understand that just because you play a game on a Microsoft computer that it always owned by microsoft.
---
This it depends on the damage done instantly and then also overtime damage if you play a game with a dbno system where a opponent can come finish you it's like that
---
Me too. My dad died last year. But since I’m 50 and dad was in his late 80’s, these things are to be expected.   
---
I do play Fallout with my son (25) though. He brought his system home for the holidays and we played in different rooms shouting at each other. We played 6-8 hours a day for two weeks during Christmas going from level 1-110. It was amazing. We even did joint nukes (our worst foe was the BSOD, server hangs, and so on).
---
Might be but I am about supporting the game.
---
No GTA V?
---
This was not on discord.
---
Her way of playing is swimming around confused about where to go instead of swimming directly to the island? Who would possibly prefer to play like that? Whose way of playing is forgetting to equip a weapon before running into a fight and remembering only when she starts getting hit and realizes she can’t fight back? No it is not her way of playing, she just forgets.
---
Your main and alt go by the same username?
---
I wish they would just make it that a rank 3 card is the same as 3 individual rank 1 cards
---
I've heard rebuilding your cache (database on the safety start screen) helps. I just did this will post an update if it helps. Was getting crashes multiple times in a game session
---
Different characters on the same account, not different accounts, so yeah
---
Noooo, it is good how it is, dont make another diablo with no way to make unique builds.
---
Fuck how i hated when they changed talent tree combinating in world of warcraft.
---
Yup, ps4
---
Yes, I've had that when porting into certain places. There was a train tunnel by Harpers that every time I tried to use it was the same deal. Have to just log out and not use that one.
---
I would be happy if I could just place all the different stuffed animals and teddy bears on and around my bed.
---
Yeah, actualy after some time you will stop to use picklock absolutly, cause it is not worth time and nerves.
---
You got 50points, 3wont kill you anyway lol
---
It's the same difference between dead dead and mostly dead. See, when you're dead dead, theres only one option. Go through your baggie and look for loose springs. However, mostly dead is slightly alive, in which case they can get you back up on your feet with a chocolate coated stimpak. (I do hope you've seen the Princess Bride, otherwise I'll seem like a bigger ass than I have intended.)
---
It may be that there's a box everywhere, but I can definitely confirm that Grafton Steel has it as well.
---
Certainly not alone. 
---
Awesome. I see now, thanks
---
Run patrol duty quest, guranteed plan droppage, how I got mine at lvl 100
---
Where’s that?
---
someone already got 2 of them and have 1 left, 1500 caps. 
---
Vyurr327 ingame
---
Yes patch it now because you say so....
---
I paid 1 cap per shotgun shell last night just so I didn’t have to farm plastic. I had 1500 shells in a matter of minutes. Worth it to me.
---
Becouse people playing fallout are autistic noobs they come with "you can solo everything" strategy. Thats why we had nuke on first day and now everyone can solo silo, without losing time trying to hack computer. I hope vaults will be fucking nightmare. Like raids o  vanilla wow.
---
So you have to get best gear, make yourself best build, get chems, boobleheads etc.... Then get team and try to progress.
---
That’s good stuff 😂
---
I was assuming that armor build with higher INT would have more durability, not higher extra durability.
---
At this point just having the 200% repair perk nullifies any benefit of having high INT.  You just need the perk and you are good to go.
---
I was hoping that the durability of the base item would be higher (higher durability bar) rather than just 100% going to 200%.
---
Starched genes makes any mutation permanent, as long as it is equipped 
---
Alright thanks, could be a nice step forward 
---
No this bug is still about. I now have a base which causes me to lag so much I get kicked from a server as soon as I log in. 
---
Man of she had landed she was fucked.... Royally? Ba..dun...ching
---
I ended up doing it. I could've probably done it by myself but by some miraculous chance a level 20 dude was doing the same thing as me so we went through together. 
---
Since I was wearing power armor though the "kill a wendigo in a clown costume" thing didn't REGISTER... But even going through the second time around and the ambience and feel of it makes it just as scary for me as the first lmao. I love it.
---
If I initiate encounter with player that is 100 levels higher, then its not griefing low level players, and the jokes are on me :)
---
Shut up nerd 
---
Wt
---
You are right about the extra durability (100% - 200%), but the regular durability was always the same (the length of the bar) whether I used a character with 5 INT or one with 30 INT.
---
So basically there is no reason to have high INT at all.  The 200% repair perk nullifies any benefit of having high INT since you can just repair to 200% durability after the fact.
---
I ended up buying the plan. Dude gave it to me for 600 caps so don't feel too bad. 
---
Like others said just get demo expert an rifle dmg. Other perks can be up to you unless you're trying to min/max. I run rifle dmg demo expert an then just stuff to keep my gear from breaking like white knight an anything allowing me to carry more stuff like Thru hiker an strong back. I have 0 issues killing anything lvl 98.
---
Is there a list anywhere of the mutations that are mutually exclusive?
---
Waste Virgina is sort of like Mother Russia, in that you don't really "find" anything, such things find you, usually on a character that has no use for them.
---
Ok?
---
Same 😩👌
---
All of those items in the workshop have absolutely no purpose right now. 
---
Would be cool to see some functional arcade cabinets containing the holotape games you find throughout the world. Maybe even some vintage vault-tech pinball machines.
---
It would be very useful if there were. It seems that all of the prefixes are exclusive. It then seems to me that all of the sub effects are entirely interchangeable. Within reason of course, you can’t have infinite ammo on a knife for instance.  I haven’t noticed any pattern cantering around prefix.
---
I believe you need a regular Stimpak to rez. 
---
My mom is 70 this year. We also share this experience together! She was a little distracted by WoW when a patch came out, so I lost her for a bit, but she's been getting back on more lately. Looking forward to launching our first nuke together as well!
---
See you in the wasteland!
---
Did it work?
---
"I'm not dead!"
---
I only take workshops to get the quest reward and hopefully a plan. And then I leave it. Haven't gotten to a level in which workshops are useful for me yet. :3
---
My camp is setup on the Harper's Ferry bridge and has made mutation farming easy. Walk out of my building into the tunnel with rad barrels, wait until health is between 50-75% gone and walk out. 
---
Thanks for the tip. I have (yet another) new toon fresh out of the vault, so I'll give this build a try!

Thanks man, Floofsta

You'd have to take them to court to make use of this rule, and in court you'd have a very hard time convincing a judge or jury you deserved anything, whether the law was with you or not.

Yeah, Grammerly yelled at me when I typed it. But, that's what Oppy said, so there it is. 
---
I mean... its just you in a chair watching a nuke go off. You could have titled it "Was just relaxing at camp when suddenly..." instead of making it yet another incredibly vague "76 Lost Connections" post.

There's no indication of anyone else being around in that capture at any point.
---
I experienced this yesterday. Spent an hour and half on the Motherload mission while fighting consistent freezing and eventual server disconnect on my Xbox one X. Logged back in and the mission reset to the beginning. Extremely frustrating. 
---
However this is the first time I have really experienced this. Other times have been pretty smooth and problem free.
---
Good design,takes into account that it's not people's job to play a game and they are probably tired after working all day.
---
Edit: Tried to search for the post but no luck, do you have the link somewhere please?
---
I would've gave you all those serums but I didn't see anywhere on your post of you saying "please" so I'm "sorry"
---
I see you’re a man of culture. TSEs all the way.
---
Also....to be fair, I have F76 for my PlayStation Pro too and experienced freezing on it yesterday as well. (Yes, I play it on both consoles...)
---
Oh, how I wish I could dupe my upvote.
---
There are lots of ways to one shot sadly.  But sure bloodied and tses are the worst.  But I can do it with a powerfist or my vats critical shotgun.
---
When you walk in the main entrance go down and past the shops then go out those doors and walk straight a little bit and you should find the hotspot. I’ve found everything from grafton monsters to honey beasts there
---
Was kind of joking anyway as I figured they're not something One just gives away... But you're completely right. My apologies. 
---
Yup there are plenty of one shot killers, however tse is still op
---
Good idea, I can't wait for it.

 *It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do.* *Go through his clothes and look for loose change.* 
---
Uh not the same
---
A one star explosive minigun would be enough for me tbh... But i am already gifted with an explosive .50 MG. 
---
there is a lookout tower by west tek that has planters on the landings.
---
Sentinel is from the 3rd effect so it has to be all 3*. Plus if you run into anyone that figures out your build they won't let you stand still.
---
That works too,  thank you for replying!  I'll be looking for them. 
---
Short version: because the developers are very  bad at their job.
---
Long version: because the developers are very, very, very, very, very, very bad at their job.
---
Yeah but the difference is that you would know they were illicit items to begin with.
---
I think the issue here is more like finding a $100 bill in the middle of the road, thinking, "Lucky me!" and then getting in trouble at the bank because it was counterfeit.
---
I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure I read it has to be a natural spawn to be tamed.
---
Contesting recently acquired workshops from nubs
---
I knew this question would see some magnificent answers aha
---
grab the pharma farmer perk in luck get loads of extra meds from it when looting medical containers
---
It doesn’t have two meanings lol
---
I’ve tried it and unfortunately it doesn’t change anything
---
I have it, still ran out
---
This is funny haha
---
A few things: 
---
1 Do your weapons match your level? (If you're level 30, are they level 30?) 
---
2 Have you taken any perks to increase their damage/spread/armor piercing? 
---
3 Have you learned and put on the hardened (highest damage)  reciever? 
---
4 Are the enemies level appropriate? Are you in the Forest, Ash Heap or Toxic Valley? If not, you're probably underleveled for the area. 
---
In my experience, the guns are not that bad once you invest in them. I'm still using my pipe revolver and I'm level 87. 
---
Makes for a hell of a lot of adhesive though.
---
I'll add you in a bit. Thanks so much!
---
This makes my head hurt, because this is EXACTLY what went down in The Division. Patching dupes doesn't do much. You have to BAN, permanently, the people who do the duping. Otherwise it's just an infinite chase. And while you're chasing these people and patching what they find, instead of banning them, the rest of the game gets neglected and people quit out of boredom and exasperation.
---
If they all kill in one shot how does that make TSE the op one? Dead in one shot is still dead in a single shot
---
Yeah. I've seen the same thing. I'm not sure if the spawns ever fix themself until the server goes down.
---
I'm currently level 30 and most my guns match that level, I think I'm able to go nearly everywhere but the cranberry bog 
---
Not your server 
---
I think you are correct.  Time to remove a bunch of points from INT.
---
They're inept, but they're not morons. If they ban people, and that's a pretty big if in my opinion, they're going to ban the people who went from having one two-shot explosive shotgun to having 8192 identical two-shot explosive shotguns in the space of an hour, and not people who doubled the number of brick walls in their camp twice a day.
---
You could farm mutations at emmett mountain disposal site, theres a decon shower there next to some rad barrels, should save you on rad away just remember to equip starched genes before you go in the shower
---
Pretty awful design decision for a game they *WANTED* you to play with friends
---
Just saying Asperger's is now classified as high function autism under the DSM5... And yes I too have ASD. What's her or your GT? I can make stuff for her. 
---
Yeah, I use that frequently and it’s more reliable. It just means I have to make sure the right two are always queue up though.  
---
As an example, I usually have a pistol for clearing trash while moving about and melee for the real work, but if I pull out the sniper and forget my backup is the pistol, I’m screwed.
---
...or until you disconnect (more likely)
---
Annoying I get the dps damage bug pretty much everytime I play the game and it effects most of my ballistic weapons, such as my lever action and pump action. 
---
It makes killing highier level enemies even more bullet intensive, as while I can still kill them I often need to use twice the ammo...
---
Yeah, it's not ammo they're going to look for if they look for duping. They'd be nailing people with thousands of identical high-end weapons or serums, not 100k of 308 ammo.
---
My level 16 alt has been able to buy the Death Tambo and Harpoon Gun plans from Wallace. They are rare but they do pop.
---
Yet you still reply. "Customers" LOL. It's really sad you think scamming people is a proper business.
---
Go dupe yourself
---
&gt; who knowingly caused distress to others by crashing servers
---
They're not crashing servers, they're crashing themselves. You're welcome to forward the idea that them having lots of items then lead to increased server instability, but there's certainly no proof of that and it certainly seems like it's just the most recent in a long list of convenient lies.
---
&gt; You'd have to take them to court to make use of this rule
---
You don't have to take them to court at all, I was replying to someone who was forwarding the position that because of a TOS violation, Bethesda would be able to ignore EU law, which they wouldn't.
---
If Bethesda wouldn't voluntarily refund your money after you've given them the mandated 30 days, you would just give that proof to your bank and they'd refund it for you, lol. My bank (UK) has assisted me with refunding digital goods before, I've no reason to believe they wouldn't for other people.
---
Note: I hope Bethesda does deal with them and just refunds those in the EU that request the refund.
---
I just did MfaD last night for the first time with my level 102 character. Instead of protectrons I got dozens of Major Gutsys mowing me and a brave fellow lvl 80 player down again and again. Ughh. 
---
Even a squad of four Gutsys in the wild can be seriously OP with their machine guns and perfect aim if you have nowhere to hide and can't single them out, but dozens at once? We couldn't even revive one another without dying, and I had to climb the tower three times before the trophy popped. And then all the slain Gutsys despawned before I could loot them. I was curious what the three-star legendary at the end would have dropped, but no luck.
---
TLDR;: That place atop the tower holds memories for me now, too.
---
They actually stated they make their games with multiplayer first to see how it'd turn out before gutting it for a singleplayer game.  It's my theory that fallout 76 is what fallout 4 would have been.
---
What platfor are your on?  Cause on PS4 crafted gear at 8 INT stil has about 3 different results for durability length, but that's also mainly for armor.  Weapons stop varying around 5 INT.
---
And yes, you could just repair to 200% with the perk cards; however, there are reasons to have high INT, they just don't involve crafting.  Power Patcher 3 for PA builds and Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior 5 is 8 INT already.  If focused on Heavy Weapons and using Stabalized 3, or running a medic character and using First Aid 3, that's 11 INT.
---
"Survived" ... eh. I stopped playing when it became clear they weren't never interested in curbing exploits and dupes unless it had an impact on how many shark cards were being bought.
---
It's honestly debate-able. Flashy looks with decent defense? Marine. Defense that's great? BoS Combat armor, heavy tier. It honestly all depends on how you run.
---
Takes one to know one 
---
Could not agree more
---
Vayne Solidor
---
I'll be on in about an hour
---
Sad, that actually made me laugh.
---
Loneliness wouldn't be such a problem if games like this attracted more 60+ year-olds. Stay awesome!   
---
Yeah, playing with a higher level friends is nearly impossible when you arent level 50 yet
---
Today I spent about 30 minutes chasing a lvl 35 player across the map, trying to gift them a set of Excavator PA. I pointed a headlamp's beam on the package. I shoot at it, I jumped, I emoted like a madman. Eventually they noticed what I was trying to do, thank Atom. 
---
But next time I will just kill them and stuff gifts into their paperbag.
---
I've also been wondering if they might do this.
---
And preferably reboot it with some actual human NPC survivors. Even a few would make a huge difference to the feel of the game.
---
Neon signs are very rare. Either Grahm or early on a vendor bot. I got mine off the raider vendor bot in the ski lodge basement next to Top of the World for the neon signs.
---
As for the Handmade Rifle plans, are you on Xbox? I have a level 16 alt and can try and get a plan for you by server hopping. I sell them for 1500 caps.
---
I think that's an urban myth. My inventory never shows more than one, and even if I collected three or five pieces of data, I just get ammo and stimpaks most of the time.
---
he exploited a bug. they should fix the bug.
---
My old man is responsible for my love of gaming. He died in '96 but he'd absolutely love where technology has brought us. 
---
What an excellent experience you had with your son :) ! Not many parents would play video games with their children, but you’re one of the few. You’re officially Vault Dad.
---
Didn't think they were were in the game yet. Mod maybe?
---
If you're on XBOX I have a level 16 alt and I can hop to try and get a plan for you. I sell them for 1500 caps.
---
If you'd like! I'm addicted to the weight increase, so what you're saying is complete blasphemy. 
---
Its craftable, so I dont think you need it.  You can always make more...
---
I found the plans for them on the upper floor of the Harrington mansion.
---
Can you? Yes. Should you? Debatable. Could throw calibrated shocks on it, increase carry capacity another 100lbs use it for farming junk. You could also donate it to a friend, or gift it to a random player.
---
I always mine the bench. Sometimes they don't see it coming!
---
Oops, I did not know this. Thx for telling
---
I'm usually on a few hours and dont mind teaming up or helping out. Main is 70ish and alt is 15

---
Oh I remember the days when the fusion core processor would put put 12 cores an hour. The good ol' days.
---
There's been multiple people in this thread suggesting that over 100k of any item (someone even said 10k, lol) should get you automatically banned. The original poster even said as much in their opening post (since edited out). 
---
Then people suggested that if anyone has a problem with banning everyone who has a stack size of any item over a certain amount must themselves be a ~~Witch~~ Exploiter/Duper.
---
Many of us posting have only been taking issue with those two positions. It's a strawman to try and deflect our criticisms with "They'd be nailing people with thousands of identical high-end weapons or serums, not 100k of 308 ammo." or similar.
---
You are able to craft it again if you ever need to - and at a more appropriate level.
---
All you need is huge armor piercing effect!
---
Becouse she had sooo much armor!
---
Also stack booblehead with psycho and you can kill her on first landing.
---
Not a mod I saw plans on other players inventory and he doesn't said where to get these things
---
I'm sure military paint job is from the atomic shop.
---
There’s gonna be a whole generation of older gamers soon.. I’m mid 40s and not giving up any time soon. As long as I can keyboard+mouse I’ll be playing. It’s the one thing in my life that has been consistent, since I got my first proper PC, aged 14.
---
30 years of PC gaming, this year, on my birthday, in May.
---
If you have finished the quest and got the ID Card under the floor-mat + the broken uplink item from the shelf, then restart the game (world) and go inside the bunker without your friend, and the "Early Warnings" quest will start for you personally. The broken uplink will appear in your inventory and you will be able to proceed with the quest-line.
---
Wouldn’t it be 200% durability based off your INT? So 2x of a 1 INT should be worse than 2x of a 15 INT. 
---
If she needs help I can let her tag enemies for xp and loot she finish them off. They'll scale to my high level but I'll protect her.
---
There's been a few times while playing and getting wrecked that another player comes along and helps just enough to get you over the hump and it's amazing. I see I'm not the only one here wanting to help her get past this mission.
---
Just scrap it, I use T60 with calibrated shocks, makes the excavator totally worthless.
---
It's not a atom paint 100% sure that power armor part can trade able
---
👍 unfortunately I can't get online for the next 4 hours. If you're still around I'll check in with you later.
---
You will that would be cool
---
Well, see there's a special dev room with everything inside... 
---
No, I'm not bullshitting.
---
I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to be able to get diseases from cooked foods?
---
The only unique paint Ive found in game is Nuka Cola. Also whoever designed that Hotter Rod paint sucks. Should of just made it Alley Cats Style.
---
I can't seem to find them
---
All you needed to do was pick your target (no code needed). I get that message nearly every day on site Bravo. 
---
Sorry, no. I've been in the position of the employees you're talking about. Literally the lead engineer on a game releasing for the holidays. I would _not_ expect to have the holidays off.
---
You know what you're signing up for in the industry, especially if you've been around long enough to be the kind of important team member who can get called up on xmas day to come fix something the company will suffer losses without. Working all days but xmas and New Year's is not uncommon and you usually just take some time off later to make up for it. Maybe.
---
I don't blame you for thinking it _shouldn't_ work that work, because it shouldn't, but it absolutely does and everyone working in the industry either knows it or they work for a smaller shop that still values family over profits.
---
There is BoS paints aswell which require you to turn in Technical Data. They are only for T60 though meh.
---
Yeah? So did it work??
---
You can't get them and he shouldn't have em either. 
---
Vendor box Phoenix sells just about all building plans, watoga shopping plaza not the station, Harper’s ferry vendor Wallace sells them for sure. 
---
People play games for different reasons. I don't think PVP in theory is bad, but in practice? Let's be honest, if you are an ahole in real life, you are one playing a game, and most people who pvp are aholes.
---
I don't mind, to each their own, but there's nothing magical about it. If I'm in the mood I'll fight, if they act stupid and say dumb things I block them and never think of them again.
---
Sorry pal, having a hectic few days.
---
I Haven't forgot about you. hoping to make it on later today.
---
No it's a legendary ski sword you get from a certain main quest
---
I have over 500 if still needed or I could make you gunpowder. I have way too much acid and cloth.
---
I keep asking myself if the one-shot-PvP-meta was intended. Either way it's so damn reductive as to make character builds virtually irrelevant. That said, I came by a TSE rifle yet the combat rifle that I can craft myself is just about as effective or more so in some situations. Getting 1-Shot should be rare for level 50 and above, but then I can down most people in a PVP situation with 1 mag of my unlegendary of my combat rifle. So, in a situation where someone sneaks up on you, it will be almost impossible to react whether the time to kill is 0 seconds, or the 3 seconds it takes to unload my mag.
---
My dad and I played a bunch of Diablo 3 together.  We'd chat on the phone and play for hours most days.  He told me that playing and talking helped a lot with the anxiety he had over his medical issues.  He died before turning 62.
---
You get free materials to build resource extractors. As well as mini events to defend the place from waves of mobs. It is fairly rewarding in that way but the amount of materials you can harvest from it are not the best. But you can do player vs player combat which is the draw for some people. 
---
I’ve been on Reddit all night for about 8 hours on my phone. (Nightshift) I tried to find it but the app has no history function. I’ll try on my PC next time I’ll post on it to mark it
---
Starts with packet sniffing which I've seriously considered doing but there are hundreds if not thousands of people who be a lot faster doing it. We should ask around to see if someone would help. 
---
I wish my dad had lived long enough to play this, because he would have, and he'd have loved it.    We had Dad playing Company of Heroes with us at 74, my brother and me in our 40's, and my son's in their 20's.    
---
I'm 57, and play with my bro 48, and my sons 35, 34, and son's GF.    One big happy vault family. 
---
Nice to see others like us out there in Appalachia.    :-) 
---
I won't  for a little bit but I sell all serums 200 each on xbox 
---
Ok thanks a lot
---
Well I hope you recover soon from the knee. I hope you didn’t take an arrow to it. 
---
Whoever told you that is an idiot
---
Interesting, I'll have to try this out. Haven't used VATS at all though, lol.
---
You are full of crap FYI 
---
Let noobie be party leader (no idea if this helps). Then let noobie travel to quest area first. Then let level 50 friends steal all the xpImean help. 
---
I haven't looked at the stats, but what has more damage when it's fully maxed out....the excavator or the T-60 ? (I could care less about what carries more, I'm all about what is protecting me better. )
---
Add a chap called Action. He plays a lot. 
---
You aren't a developer and you have no idea why the exploit works and what lines of code are the culprit.... Then you suggest a client side work around treating the how and not the why... Just like previous Bethesda patches... Maybe they'll hire you but I wouldn't.
---
My personal favourite weapon is a non-TS explosive MG42, so much so I built an entire character specifically around the weapon. It's just a shame crafting .308 ammo isn't very cost effective.
---
Thank you very much.
---
Mules simply log in and drop their inventory where they are standing and wait for DC again.
---
I wish the reward was high in these PVP situations. 
---
Personally I find workshops kind of a hassle. 
---
Ewe
---
Mules already have the boards in their inventory permanently. You'll have to either fix the root problem now or edit their inventory.
---
Never got into it, lol.
---
Well, to be fair, I'm talking about what BGS would do, not what randos on reddit _think_ they should do.
---
I mean they could do that but what if someone killed a duper and chose to keep his stuff would it also be fair for them to be banned?
---
But you don't need the resources. The resources are the weakest attraction to a workshop. Worse is I've been online for over an hour and no one has touched a workshop but the second I claim one suddenly it is hot property? Please. 
---
With an auto clicker you can drop everything in your inventory (stacked or not) in very little time.
---
This is just so wholesome
---
Nice work putting this all together. It's good to have answers.
---
Thank you.  I had not considered looking for a marketplace since I only play solo.
---
Maybe give it away to a high 30 or 40 depending.  A 40 for me as I crafted mine to lvl 50.  My X01 with calibrated is good looking, has the carry weight and is great protection.  A T60 with calibrated also has plus points when repairing.  But if you love it keep on trucking.
---
The problem with that is that they’d have to enable modding, which would result in many people using mods for fun, and then few using mods for bad intentions and to ruin other’s experiences. 
---
Bethesda patched Nov 
---
some player can using console command in game by editing fallout.ini
---
I think some smart players using console command
---
And entered 'qasmoke' room and loot every plans in game 
---
Clearing white spring club house with my normal, fully modded handmade (have plan) takes like 300+ rounds of 556 compared to like 30 top for TSE.  Diff is crazy.
---
T-60 will protect you more. But I would look into collecting T-51b armor if your concerned about damage resistance. Best DR you can get.
---
Thank you.  I had not yet done any research to see where the serum recipes might drop.  Good to know in case I can find a server with an active Prime Fissure nuke site.
---
[C'mon!](https://i.makeagif.com/media/1-29-2018/1iuC9_.gif) 
---
You lived an incredibly fortunate life if this is what you consider being bullied. This is just a stupid silly video game and absolutely nothing resembling actual bullying.
---
Publishers =/= developers. dont get mad that workers are having holiday breaks because the management wanted to  release it early.
---
You got me good sir, have an upvote &lt;3
---
I believe Bethesda has said they will work on allowing modding down the line for fo76.  
---
Good point, but see it for this perspective, the mod should be look by community managers 
---
I liked this location, too, but I did not like that I had to kill mobs again each time I re-logged, so I looked for an alternative and decided on the toxic water with the decon arch at the Whitespring Bunker.
---
So what do you do?
---
- Limit the weight of real world containers to say - the stash limit.
---
- Place that limit on paper bags too.
---
- Use player logs to reveal exploiters based on actions taken and gameplay statistics.
---
- Warn and temporarily ban for the offense.
---
- Logging allows you to be reactive when exploits are discovered.
---
- Logging allows you to be proactive and investigate weird behavior.
---
You want exploiters to exploit. You know how much the industry pays for penetration testing? (Not porn.)
---
Maybe that's part of the problem. I have completed the first round of Rose quests. 
---
Somehow I found Abbie's bunker, but got started on the BoS, and more recently started on the Enclave. 
---
If you take a workshop but aren't willing to defend it then it's kind of your own fault if you lose it.
---
No gamer sees a stack of legendaries lying around like that and thinks it's perfectly legit.
---
Nice! Also, if you like playing slow and deliberate there are actually thousands of people out there who would want to play with you because they prefer a slower pace as well. Nothing worse than playing with someone who always rushes off and makes you feel like you're under time pressure when you want to have a look around for loot or read a terminal or something. 
---
lol, ok. You think the console is being used? Nope. The room is real, physical and in the game world. No teleporting via console needed.
---
Just for the record, the room ID isn't qasmoke like previous games.
---
I'm lvl 89 and no fancy double shots yet. I've been grinding whitespring, watooga, uranium fever and nothing.  Because of this, I'm almost sure most of those people that sell and trade double shot explosive weapons, are dupers.
---
Good sir, I believe you will find herds of your mind here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/
---
If I want to equip Bear Arms, Bandolier Ammo, 3 separate Heavy Gunner Perk cards, Pack Rat, and Pharmacy cards all fully upgraded. I should be able to do so to max out a unique build as much as I want. Make Fallout 76, like Fallout 4. Lol
---
Usually people just drop bags on the ground if they're giving stuff away, I doubt anyone screams DUPER and takes the bag lol this story seems embellished
---
Oouu that's a good idea! Give it stuff to gift people! Once the dupers are banned hopefully. 
---
The recipe dupes are starting to get around I think.  Actually crafting them isn't so bad (takes 1 flux of a given type and some very casual to come by junk).
---
The recipes do drop through.  We've had a half dozen or so in my play group.  Figure 4 or 6 guys hitting the queen 2 or 3 times a day and you get them eventually.
---
I average about a crash an hour since the December update. Crash about 85% of the time, disconnects the rest. Crash seem more often when I’m inventory screens or transferring to my stash. 
---
Personally, I'm just goofing around not caring until they decide to offer private servers. That's the only thing that will fix things for me now.
---
When I give things away now at the Overseer's Camp, I use Chameleon gear. I tell them to look in the blue vault-tec crate and sneak. For some reason many of them unfreeze and look in the crate once I am not visible. It makes no sense to me at all but it seems to work.  Granted I mostly am giving away plans so the weight limits work for the crate where it wouldn't with the original posters gifts. 
---
This. Play any COD and there are so many children under 10 tossing out cuss words, and racial and gay slurs. There was one I played with in a lobby who had a speech impediment and he sounded like he had to have been 4-6 years old but cussing like a sailor.
---
No, there isn't tho. Log on and try picking up EVERYTHING you see and try to get the game from stopping you at any point.
---
OK. Well rose is still telling me she likes me, but will gut me if I don't do what she says, so I guess I need to get to work.  
---
Dupers at this point honestly need to just die all I want to do is run around with my all rise and smash things but nope I get disconnected constantly or I get stuck leading into area. 
---
I did not know this about serum recipes, thank you.  Sadly, farming the Scorchbeast Queen does not appear to be a viable option for me.  I have server hopped hundreds of times and only found an active Prime Fissure nuke site twice.  Both times I joined the Scorchbeast Queen event and both times she glitched.  The first time we got her down to 33% health and then her health popped back to 100% and then I was kicked off the server (I am assuming the server crashed).  The second time we got her down to 50% and then she flew off to the edge of the map where we could not get to her and the timer ran down to a failed event.
---
As a solo player, I also had not considered looking for a marketplace online, either, thank you.  I may just take a look.
---
Trading would be extremely convenient and would further incentivize the co-op, multiplayer  aspect of the game. I complexity agree. 
---
I just rebuilt mine last night as it allows you to mine more lead in nodes at the lucky mine.
---
As a heavy weapons build, this is a godsend.
---
Thank you very much for this.  As a solo player, I had not considered looking for ways to connect with others who might have acquired the recipes.  I may just take a look.
---
Exactly. It’s be nice to have some type of fix for that. 
---
Ah damned
---
MIVI fat man with maxed explosives and 
---
auto stim at lower health perk cards with a large supply of super stim packs my good man. 
---
Two reasons I’m keeping mine in my inventory all the time.. 
---
1. With calibrated shocks it’ll give you increased weight so that you can fast travel with 200 extra pounds around the map. For either breaking down scrap or selling weapons \ armor
---
2. If you plan on mining nodes “for aluminum or iron” it doubles your collection rate.
---
I'm speaking only for myself, but I have rarely gone back and played games I worked on. You get too close to the thing for it to be fun anymore. I usually only went back to them after a few years, when they'd be fresh again.
---
When you're on the dev side, games in general can become less fun. The problem of the gynecologist on his wedding night, as is sometimes said.
---
Me too
---
Bethesda doesn't like turning away cheaters. They desire to run off the dedicated fans that actually want to play the game and go through the story. 
---
Yes of course I hadn't even thought of potential witch hunting for identifying an individual. Looks like I should ho read all the rules myself before I accidentally break one or more! 
---
I started with stealth, switch to PA because there is literally zero benefit to not using it. If you are sneak rifle, you can still kill anything before it gets to you, and alerts others. The noise seems to be only in you UI...not to the monsters.
---
Honestly though, it’s not worth it.  Current meta has ruined any chance at stealth/range.
---
Range is one. Sledge, powerfist, Shotguns without explosive (you'd be surprised how good the spread is on a TSE shotgun while scoping). 
---
Also, I mean one-shot for people who have something like 400DR and at most 20% other applicable resist. What most will roll with.  There are those who invest into endurance, find player damage specific gear, or stack other kinds of resists.  Against those players, most things won't just one-shot them.  Explosive still will (and if not one shot, then on a rapid fire gun, kill them before they can react ofc).
---
In addition, there will be content rolling out in the future that will likely change the sturdiness of our characters for the better, more loot to loot, etc. But explosive and bloodied will still be outliers.  
---
Now, I've played a lot of mmos and online games and it always goes the same way. A number of people are going to defend their guns to the death, but I suggest anyone relying on a TSE get a backup plan, because if Bethesda ever wakes up, there are going to be a number of changes, and weapon balance will be one of them.
---
Create it by yourself, use super duper, mod it a bit with some cheap mode like shadowed to raise chance, and scrap it. You can get chest mods while scraping legs or arms as well.
---
Eastern reigonal penitentiary, two quests can spawn there, server hop until it loads, quests can take 20+ minutes but guranteed plan drop
---
I agree to some extent. I picked up a much lower level follower who shadowed me for a while. I attacked a big place with a workshop. He watched me spend half an hour clearing the place out, using up all my ammo and meds, then as soon as they were cleared he jumped in and took workshop. He'd killed like one supermutant. I gave him a thumbs down and I  got a confused question mark response. I don't want to start going around killing innocent players however should I have just bashed him and taken "my" rightful workshop?
---
The biggest problem is how much they spam. The sonic blasts literally blind me and they’re virtually impossible to dodge. One time I timed it and the scorchbeast fired nonstop for literally 7 minutes with no pause in between, and it flys around like crazy while firing they clearly have some aim assist that is way to good 
---
Really? I'll have to check in to that. Another side question- When you buy PA armor paint can you place that paint on any set of PA? (Let's say I went with T-51 and scrapped the T-60..can I still paint it with the paint I had on the T-60?)
---
I’m 81 and I move found two two shot heavy guns but no explosive yet :(  A plain TS Gatling gun has gotten me through just shout everything so far , the TS bloodied harpoon gun on the other hand is not the best but sure does pack s single punch at 500 dang
---
Pick only perks you really need. You are melee, take pharmaci. You are ranged? You dont need so much healing, rake bandolier. 
---
You dont need have everything.
---
As long as you're still on the quest, I believe you can just craft roses barrel on any regular syringer.
---
That is reasonable. However there is still the issue of acquiring 2 single level perk cards such as expert lock pick, travel agent, etc. Having double of these cards is in no way beneficial to any character build. Which is why I still support a patch that includes trading perks with other players or some sort of bank where cards can be swapped/sold.
---
Excavator PA
---
Excavator, it scraps for black titanium. 
---
I know Calibrated Shocks are in game, friend modded my Utracite legs with that mod, just hoping plans for other mods have dropped.
---
Any unnamed one like that is excavator.
---
Yes. The only sets all paints don't work on are Ultracite armor if I remember correctly.
---
I don’t see a reason to use any other PA besides Excavator unless you like the look of one of the other PAs, need cheaper repair costs, or want the jetpack. 
---
With the current state the game is in with the TSE meta and super powered melee, everything besides SBQ dies in 1 or 2 hits. So I don’t see a real need for the extra DR and the Resistance on Excavator is plenty for nuke zones. 
---
Therefore I choose to take advantage of extra carry weight and not get out of my excavator. 
---
closest point on map? ive heard thunder mountain substation 2 but cant find anything besides the messenger event nearby
---
Watoga robots sometimes die for no reason, on spawn. Its great when legendary dies that way, cause you arent aware of it and it just explodes.
---
I'm lvl 33, is there any reasonable way for me to still get these plans?
---
Ballistic, because they actually work
---
Not sure.  I do see a difference in my gun duration when I run it but the trigger rate is...intermittent...at best.  Would like to see it bumped a percent or two.
---
Can personally confirm that handmade plans drop from Patrol, was lvl 200+ and did that quest the first time and got handmade plans.
---
Some people say on discord chat 
---
sStartingConsoleCommand=
---
Is worked before 2nd game patch in nov
---
They said before debug patch can using console command in game 
---
It is a very good practice to review what is expected of you, yes. A habit that is useful for a lot of things.
---
Of course, I forgot that was a thing haha
---
I agree with that, but it’s the single level perk cards like travel agent, lock pick etc that create issues. 
---
Thank u i'll add u later !!

Just picked up a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet from a vendor. Beats the standard Mole Miner I was using.

Grim Reaper's Sprint + Gun Fu on melee is amazing. Omae wa mou shindeiru.

Sweet. Thanks man. BTW love yur username. :)

Is THAT what's happening?  I've been trying to learn the Marine armor mods and I ended up with "Biocomm" mesh the other day and for the life of me couldn't figure out why it wasn't popping up on my limb mods. 
---
I thought it was some lame hidden classification like light/med/heavy combat armor.
---
You have to wear a silly costume. I prefer naked with the eye bot helmet and say over the mic that I'm a robot from the government here to disperse helpful care packages

This is my issue too. I've created a post and had a few people mention in it. Add me if you like, username is piquant

Not sure what was going on. Possibly some type of survey maintenance.

Duplicates of single rank cards stack and don’t create clutter. It just displays the card with x4 underneath or whatever the count is. I imagine the system is meant to give you these things in much the same way useless legendaries are given to you (IE ghoul slayer’s gamma gun). 
---
I get the desire for better stuff, but a game that always gives the rewards you want often times isn’t a great game for as long. I wish two shot explosive guns dropped more often, but know if they did it would make the game boring much sooner
---
Saw a pair of guys in clown costumes and this mask running around Whitesprings last night on PS4.  Not sure what shenanigans they were getting into but I was amused.
---
Energy weapons are kinda meh at the moment. Low ass durability, lower dps even vs robots. Ammo is the most expensive next to ultracite.
---
Over all worthless class of weaponry at the moment.
---
Or even regular ghouls.
---
I just hit 45 last night!

We need a way to connect with friends through fallout.   We need a mail system to send messages to people on friends list, and a way to chat with them.  The game isolates you from your friends too much.  You have to join their server, find them, then hope they are on area chat to talk to them.  We need a way to be like "hey I'm going to launch a nuke, want to join?".   This is one of 100s of missing features.
---
I don’t understand why people trade anything, period.  There are far better shooty-games if you don’t like finding loot or exploring (which will give you whatever you need).
---
That’s awesome!

On PC you can use Z/C to jump in 5% increments across the bar, it's pretty dang quick.

Can't find it :(

It's sad that the best way how to spend your Sunday is trolling on reddit.

LOL.

Doesn't help that they nerfed extractor production into the dirt. Before the nerf I used to see most workshops that produce decent mats held, but after, no one gives a shit anymore. 
---
Cause making deals at crossroads never goes wrong!
---
You probably got it on chest and not on limbs. Its also different for arms and legs I believe cause I have some mods open on arms which I dont have on legs of same armor type.
---
I can see myself at twitchcon in 5 years... “what inspired you to begin streaming?”

Mhm and even with power armor they whittle away at your hp non stop

Technically I would consider melee more of a kinetic weapon and guns I would call ballistic. That being said I prefer ballistic weapons, melee, then energy weapons in that order. Simple fact is that energy weapons break way too fast and there aren't any perks geared speciafically for energy weapons. It almost feels like they forgot them or threw them in at the last minute. The only love they got was the tri-edition skin. Regular guns have stealth and and explosive options. If you want to use laser rifles you have to carry 6 of them to clear one building.
---
Then why are you replying to my reply of someone else with something completely unrelated then? Make your comment top level, because it certainly didn't apply to me or what I said/was talking about.
---
I get that, but weapons are not directly comparable to perk cards in that they have a cap value and could potentially be sold for profit if not actually utilized by the player. Duplicate single level perks have 0 worth to a player. I think for leveling up 5 times players deserve something that at least has some sort of value. 
---
*you're*
---
Vendor Bot Responder, the roaming one, or you can buy it from someone.
---
I wish Bethesda would name these better and also add a way to check which plans and recipes are unlocked and locked.
---
At the moment the most powerful guns in the game seem to be, two shot kinetics or explosive round kinetics. I've never even heard of someone having a two shot or explosive round laser, so you can see which of these two styles the developers definitely prefer... 
---
I think two shot and explosive weapons should be  cut from the roster completely because they kill PvP deader than a dodo, but that's a different issue. 
---
Kinetic because I like boom booms and bullets that are invisible in flight (allowing you to see more of the impact when you shoot a stranger in the chest). 
---
Still love PvP and willing to match up anybody with the stomach to take me on. See my bio to challenge me! 
---
Are you a Calvert? Jezebel? Or just doomed as a robobrain?

I really wish it was more.....idk more thought put into pvp and its mechanics.

Me and a friend were about level 15 or so and my friend thought we should go for a workshop. Neither of us really had any idea what it was for. The defend event started and the ghouls actually gave us significant trouble at our low levelness. A level 7 and a 59 came and the 59 started attacking us. Not knowing that they do very little damage if you don’t hit back I fought in self defense. My friend tried too. We died. We came back and he was just standing there shooting the stuff we built and killed us again. I was mad, it took another couple deaths before my friend even realized he was harassing us (not the smartest guy my friend) and after all this he never even tried to claim the workshop he just came to attack us. So we died maybe 4 times before combined we managed to kill him and take his junk. Though he then came back and killed us again. Another 7 or so deaths before we killed him again, I spent a lot of time running around trying to not be killed in one hit from his melee. Anyway it was super annoying and really ruined my day, it’s not like he wanted the workshop he just came to harass us. Even after we left he never claimed the workshop. 
---
I'm at work, so no loss for me. You know "work"? When you actually do something for a living? Not bullshitting people like you. But I guess nobody would employ a thickie like yourself. Keep on hustling :-D

Found a Duper.

Use decon arches

Sure, but I need the plan. I’ve got the perks.

This. I've purchased so little items from players because I object to duping. I've had a couple of plans and stuff but mostly I sell things I've gathered. 
---
pc
---
Darn! No way to do it once you've passed the quest? 
---
I prefer T51 for the high DR and ER. Run XO1 if you want high ER and RR. To me RR isnt a big deal though if you farm with Rad Sponge on a team. The rest of the armors are lower in values. Like T45 is balanced across all 3. You xan raise youre DR and ER even higher with Scaly Skin+Grounded on then equip Strange in Numbers when on a team. I sit around 670 DR and 850 ER in T51 with over 100% repair.
---
Thanks, but that was melon blossom (and a melon plant).  I'm trying to find melon bloom.  I was actually able to buy the two I need from the Whitespring Resort food vendor, but I'd still like to know at least one spot where they grow.

Yeah, just scrap it. Some people who can't seem to manage their weight would say otherwise.
---
Or 
---
If you're a heavy ... that is the ONLY time I suggest excavator PA. The carry weight bonus is moots since you can get calibrated shocks on your t 60 and rock on. {Yes, yes for all you out there anal about carry weight, I know there is a difference in their max weight capacity .. by 100.}
---
Le epic gamer girl... so different from all the other girls. 
---
This is beautiful! Thank you for sharing
---
I haven't really checked.  If you can't modify a syringer with the barrel at a crafting station, the only other ways to get it are to buy it from someone else or make an alt character to get it and transfer it to your main.
---
Uhm... I have a hard time understanding you. For years I've been told Americans don't really get time off, nor sick days etc. So no. I expect them to be in work and fix stuff.
---
Also they released a broken game. Poor planning on beta and release date. They could have planned this differently. 
---
Why do this anyway? It's not like there's actual monetary gain. People who 'buy' this shit are doing nothing but ruining their own experience. People who 'sell' are ruining it for everyone else.

I get it when on signs they have letters that have fallen off (look at Senator Blackwell's office sign... the "or" fell off and is on a side table) but these are just examples of poor proofreading.

Well ya gotta start somewhere, this is how some rebuild in the wastes lol
---
That's true, but still doesn't allow you to just display it in your camp - it recalls to your inventory quickly enough

All the time.

I just chalk it up as my character hasn't showered since we left the vault as there is no running water ... or showers ... or baths that connect to pipes.

I play with my son as well. I'm 42 and son is 21. We're in different states so we play online together to keep in touch.

I've been noticing it alot more often after the maintenance a few days ago. I think the devs adjusted the rate bodies disappear or something. Probably for server stability, ironically we all know that's not the issue.. it's the guy with 60 tonnes of duped inventory 
---
Ive never traded. If i want to give something, i drop it. I def wouldnt pay real money for ingame stuff, ill get it myself. Duping makes no sense to me.

Jealous dad here, my daughter is 8.  Too young to be a destroyer of worlds just yet.  Some day...

This raises one question: how do you have so many TSE weapons?
---
You were at a workshop?
---
&gt; herbivore does not prevent you from getting effects since I used a marsupial serum yesterday (yeah despite getting it 3x naturally, I keep having terrible luck losing it instantly due to fat fingered radaway or trying to get rid of others) and got it while already being an herbivore. I don't know for sure but I think I recall some patch notes saying they fixed that issue
---
Carnivore doesn't prevent serums from working either. This was patched in the 12/4 update. Since then, I (carnivore) have taken one serum with no issues, and my wife (herbivore) has taken 2 serums.
---
The patch notes said vaguely that a bug with serums not correctly applying had been fixed, but didn't specify what the bug was.
---
Yeah but you have to fight your way in there every server hop right? I just stand on the barrels by the nuka plant its much quicker I think
---
Dismissive!
---
yeah i know, really just want to use the Ultracite PA all the time, but can't because of this :/
---
Let me know if you get any evidence of Jetpack or stealthboy for it :) or even a red tactical headlamp..
---
Yes, got a tse one and it has put all my other tse weapons in standby when not fighting scrochedbeast or queen. It aims, reloads, move easy and fast, and the damage is good enough for one shot most of things. The 20% runing speed with perks is nice too
---
I finally brought myself to put money into the atomic shop to by some emotes and one camp thing I would love some armor paints but im not paying 40 fuckin dollars nearly for a game ive already paid 60 for...... bethesda must be fuckin high if they think those prices are ok in the least. I had to think for weeks on spending 5 bucks on a single emote honestly....
---
Eject from your T60, store it in your stash. Go get another power armor frame, put the excavator on that frame, eject and store it. The excavator now weighs 10 pounds. 
---
&gt; Note: I personally hope Bethesda does still deal with them
---
I'm a duper but I'm advocating for dupers to be punished?
---
Aspie on PC. Add me if you want
---
This happens a lot, all over the places. Mobs Just die by themselves when you enter an area.
---
r/thathappened
---
I thought you had more of a neutral stance about dupers and were more anti bethesda judging by your reply. My bad.
---
I can only hope they'll find a way. Maybe add in a report player system for duping and then bethesda checks their inventories and sees 273 TSE miniguns, then they were involved with dupers, or duped. This would render duping tougher, harder to profit from, and probably would discourage most dupers in general. Eventually get them to stop.
---
We should at least be able to keep it in our power armour work station.
---
No gamer that's aware that this is an issue, but there are tons of people who play that don't watch youtube or look on reddit or other forums who may fall victim to snagging exploited materials from a box or vendor. 
---
About as valuable a reply as your first.
---
I haven't even tried to get over to those areas as a teenager. \*sigh\* Time to put on my big boy pants....
---
This one is from the Rose quest. Tried to tame it many times and despite the tame works, he becomes enemy again in 1min.
---
There is now a developer room in the game that somone has broken into, so if they even exist they should have been in there, but there is not a lot of talk about the room, the Owl head outfit is suppose to be from that room...
---
I do beleive even outside of ALL that. Damage is still bugged. For even without a TSE weapon, I have mobs taking hits and restoring anywhere from 2-5% of health per hit sometimes, not all the time. I mean they are still taking damage but if I am doing 5 dps they are healing for 2 or so ... it's dumb7.
---
Yeah I was just trying to make a joke. That dude is DEFINITELY duping. I had forgot that boards are usually used to trigger the server drop though, good catch.
---
Buying it from others sounds like the best idea then if it doesn't let me craft the mother trucker. 
---
Anyone that has one they don't care about, please see my bio, get in touch and sell me yours. I will pay less than average caps (for a weapon you've already been paid to create)
---
I have heard that a high perception can let you have the compass bill of people who are invisible. Then once you're standing close enough to an invisible person you can see their name. I have low Perception so I have to be holding your hand to see your name.
---
Bullshit, anyone can tell the difference. Pretending otherwise is just that ... Pretending.
---
Understood, thank you.
---
Yup ... they did mention it would break animiations.
---
They weren't wrong. They should have just capped it at 110 then, as thats the highest without hitches.
---
Not bad, just a half baked shit fest. Lol.
---
Fair enough mate.
---
What kind of effects does it have?  Thanks to the RNG-based legendary system and microscopic stash limit, a vast majority of what drops will have little to no value
---
That guy is most likely cheating. The only known armor paints you can get are the Nuka Cola paint and the BoS paints, there is a thread about all the BoS stuff you can get from turning in Technical Data.

We’re talking about fallout 76 not finding a better MMORPG bruh

Well, auto grenade launchers are kinda glitched right now (bear arms doesn't decrease its weight), so many probably won't be interested in it unless it has 90% reduced weight.

maybe the same way people get ten thousand (10,000) bobbleheads, duplicating

---
Copper and Lead and Steel for ammo production.
---
Sounds like the people over at r/gaming
---
I think if you’re selling useless legendaries for caps you really have to re-evaluate value:weight. Most guns are not worth selling. Stimpacks, mentats, and buffout are pretty insignificant in weight and have a better value:weight. Legendary weapons are valued to vendors according to their base weapon worth and are not valued at all by other players you could sell them to. The original point, however, is RNG for perk packs must have an equivalent downside rather than having a continual upside buff.
---
What you’re suggesting is a return to something more like FO4’s system which essentially let you be the jack of all trades by end game. A system of constant buffs and god tier elevation gets old pretty quickly.
---
And honestly if you don’t like the cards you’re getting, just play for longer. I’m 254 and I could give 2 shits about my perk packs. Those stopped being relevant 150 levels ago.
---
It is by Can Do! alone I set my mind in motion.

It is by the Cans of Dogfood that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains.

The stains become a warning.

Been playing an alt just to get this stuff.  Hopefully they fix it in the next patch.
---
Those can alarms seem to be the fastest and easiest way to farm both lead and steel together.
---
This was great
---
Just server hop outside and run to the door. If it does pop once you get there log out and go again. Didn’t take me too long. Better than making an alt and trusting someone to transfer it for you
---
He bought them from the market?  Player trading is a thing...
---
No, I’m downvoting another hater who doesn’t care that people enjoy the game. Let em enjoy it instead of trying to somehow support this movement to shame everyone who does enjoy it.

I just shoot the bag, they usually get curious enough to look, then I wave and run, half the time they chase me until they realize I can run supa fast lmao. I just wanted to give you some stims and food, maybe toss a sacrificial blade on a lvl 5 machete, not be your friend. Lol. 
---
Lemme just be that random NPC that shows up with a couple gifts and you never see him again.

Games aside, you might want to adjust your boydar, because it's picking up blips who aren't good for you. You may have proven that you're capable in-game, but that doesn't change the fact that you were attracted to two guys who were the type to think it's okay to tell their girlfriends they were no shit at something they enjoyed. Look for the kind of guy who will encourage you, not tear you down and paint you as inferior to support his ego.

What is the level Range for a Lever Action Rifle plans?

I agree. Although I cant stop playing, the pitiful condition of this game kills me.
---
Petition for facepalm photo mode pose!
---
Nah dude it's not pretending if you don't know any better. Hell my first time I went to a station and saw a legendary for sale I didn't realize it was there because a player sold it to the vendor I thought it was the vendor them self who randomly sold that item. I came back every day hoping I'd find that legendary again and it wasn't there. I avoided reddit for spoilers til I got a good ways into the game so I never realized the shit I sell appears in the vendor screen. Maybe I was oblivious maybe I didn't care it doesn't matter but if I note that a whitesprings clothing vendor has 15 casual outfits then see the whitesprings station vendor has 15 legendary tse rifles my first thought (not knowing any better) is that it's the vedors loot, not exploited items. 
---
I've actually got a two-shot and explosive ultracite laser (unfortunately not on the same gun) but even then its the same issue with any other energy weapon, their time-to-kill compared to ballistics is just so piss poor that they aren't worth using.
---
you can grind XP at white springs, with 6 hours play time you could easily grind to level 50 there in one go
---
I trade serum and learnt all recipes. Farmed those with 12 friends. I sold like 300 serums so far (in around 3 weeks) and if you check serum prices you might figure it's easy for me to buy a weapon or fluxes for ultracite ammo.
---
What's your gt I'll msg you when I get on 
---
Not often you get to say you're so proud of your son for nuking a leisure resort
---
It's a level 50,2 shot, 250 damage resist on reload, and +33% vats chance. 
---
The consequence will be I will kill them.
---
It's sad I'm more impressed with the fact you played 2 hours without a disconnect than the actual feat.
---
Yeah man I'm game. Whats your gamertag?
---
I think the majority of the hate on this game is BS and nonsense controversies (some is actually just lies: hacking on PC claims, trade steal glitch, etc.).
---
BUT.
---
Bethesda should have patched dupe glitches within days - at most. GTAO is often several hours before they are patched. There are websites you can go to where people work out GTA dupe glitches and workarounds for previous patches. They probably have a dev pressing F5 on there every hour to check for new ones to patch.
---
This is one thing (along with stash increase please) they need to get on top of quickly. The game hasn't been out 2 months and the P2P economy may never recover from the thousands of TSE shotguns and handmades that every twat and his cat has now. As a side note: these weapons genuinely ruin the game. I'm using lower levelled weapons to have fun again. I can't just stand still shooting the floor near them. I have to *do something*.
---
There are quite a few that I have unlocked. To name a few : 
---
1) Knight SGT
---
2) Knight CPT (Copper metal finish)
---
3) Sentinel
---
4) Paladin (Class dark metal/red trim)
---
5) Elder (Ivory/Grey look)
---
Yep. I just got the game last week though, so still fairly low level. On Xbox.
---
if they have no way to remove duplicated items or punish those who do it or support it then yeah, private servers are the only future this game has left
---
The scorchbeast could have been someone else's kill. I killed one up by the actual hotel and it somehow landed on top of my base at the bottom of the golf course xD 
---
Thank you! I'm sure she'd appreciate that!
---
Near it yes, to start with. We then claimed it and I then moved away. Still got killed

---
Like PvP? Check out my bio and we'll have a duel over the rate of exchange lol
---
I feel you. I sometimes see them restoring some of the damage dealt. Most likely lag or failed hit registration.
---
I'm curious, why the super stims? Diluted stimpacks are much more useful, especially for low level players. 
---
I play with the FOV on the highest setting. This just happened after I entered my power armour and it froze then glitched.getting back in fixed it I just thought this was funny. 
---
Heyhighhello
---
Even if it’s just a handful of stims, food and boiled water? Not dropping endgame plans or nothing, just a little bump to help. 
---
I don't think so, I was in the middle of nowhere.
---
But even if someone was neaby, I would have at least heard the fight.  I'd been at my camp crafting for a good 15 minutes before it literally appeared out of nowhere.
---
That still doesn’t explain the fact that we couldn’t do any damage to him, yet he 1 shot us both! I usually do about 700 damage per shot, more than enough to take down most people in 1. Yet his health didn’t even move.
---
Mmm, cans of Dune food, err, dog food.
---
To be fair if you have the marsupial and bird bones mutation and run strange in numbers you can basically fly add the jetpack mod for power armor and you'll never have to touch the ground. That's not cheating as for the gun if you put the extra large mag on the Gatling gun it holds like 500 bullets and doesn't shoot super fast so that may be why it seemed like they never reloaded.
---
You need to buy 2 shocks. I had the same problem with my x01
---
No shit.

It's been suggested
---
When you craft things, and you don't have enough metal, it will auro-scrap mods. This is happening to everyone. The only way to avoid it is to pay really close attention to the crafting screen when it tells you what it is using before you hit the button to craft again.
---
Really?
---
And then the server clapped and everyone started chanting your name. Bethesda was so impressed they gave 1M caps and free access to everything in the store. Later, the dupers girlfriend found you and asked you out on a date. 
---
Literally crying, it was so epic 
---
This is an interesting way to go about it. I'm on PC but I'll try this method out.
---
But you're right, they had this pretty well in 4 and someone decided to throw a monkey wrench in it. It's frustrating. 
---
That's a weird bug then. I mean I have robots spontaneously die around me all the time but they usually respawn soon. I just figured it was regular maintenance or something 
---
I'll have to ask her what hers is, but mine is Ramman321. And I didn't know it's now classified like that, but it makes sense. She's very high functioning, just has a few quirks and her own way of thinking and doing certain things. 
---
Wait what? Give it to me now ! :D
---
Usually works for me. 
---
I’ll see a guy in vault 76, fast travel over there (it’s free to FT to 76 btw) and send a message. *’ITS DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE. TAKE THIS!’*
---
Two dudes got the reference and laughed. The rest seem curious enough to stay until they see a bag. 
---
Gilded Wall Clock, inside Whitesprings Resort 
---
Right!? I dumped 30 plans and recipes into Morgantown station news stand. Stood there trying to motion low levels to it. Even announced on mic (I think, give visible ptt indicator please!) They just ran away. I'm tired of carrying them or storing them though. For all I know they disappeared before someone found them.
---
I was actually annoyed when Cait got clean and started getting pissy with me for using chems to, like, y'know, save our lives, and stuff.
---
Server hopping is for lazy dildos with no integrity and no dignity.
---
I'm sure just about everything has been suggested at this point.
---
Doesn't mean I can't add my voice to the chorus 😜
---
“Yes kid, hurting your feelings was 100% a cost of doing business, sorry bout it.”
---
Honestly though, I’ve hurled my fair share of expletives at groups of people hanging about workshops waiting for marks. I think that some people expect honorable combat and others expect raider tactics. If you act like a raider and shoot at me, prepare for the verbal abuse that goes with cheesing another human with feelings.
---
Also, Charleston junkyard does not belong on the list of pvp focused areas imho. 
---
The belly of the beast quest has issues. But if ya didn t know this. If u know where the quest ends you can go straight there. Just use the transponder at the next to last stop. And enter last part. (Trying to offer this advice with out spoilers, not knowing how far you have made it.) Don t need to hit all waypoints. If ya have been to them.prior to d\c can skip ahead.
---
Wish anyone in my family or circle of fiends played 76!  Would without a doubt alter my experience with the game for the better (which I already think is decent, not hating on it).
---
I remember when I used to make these points only to get shit on by this entire sub. Times have changed. 
---
You are a hero and a saint. Thank you. 
---
no problem :)
---
It doesn't cost legal fees to pursue criminal charges, it only takes filing a police report. 
---
So I did overlook the mule part. That changes this scenario a lot lol. I'm picturing you walking around at the slow move 100% of the time and thinking "that's total bullshit, nobody plays at that speed..".
---
I agree with exploring, it's honestly the best part of the game (suppose you could argue for playing with friends as well).
---
I also agree that it would be bullshit for anyone to get banned if they didn't do anything. So I highly doubt (but fuck it, who knows anymore) that they would do any ban determination on numbers of craftable items or junk/super common stuff. It would be based on something like 5000+ of a bobblehead or legendary item. There's 0% chance someone has legit found that many or even purchased them.
---
Odds are (at least if it were me) they would use that info to identify potential dupers, and then observe them actually doing it (some kind of logging) in order to justify enacting a ban.
---
Where do you get Western revolver?
---
I'll bite on that. I need Marsupial I got the rest. 
---
Same happened in STW. As much as it sucks, it gets people playing the game, so there's foot dragging about dealing with it. The simplest way would be to suspend player to player trading for a while, either direct or via dropped items.
---
I was annoyed when Cait got clean and started getting pissy with me for using chems to, like, y'know, save our lives, and stuff.
---
My only thing with this is the following. I had a workshop and a dude twice my level started taking it. I quickly realized that I wouldn't be able to stop him so I waved and started to walk away. He shot me dead on the spot. I get it, you get caps. But was it really necessary? I basically said "here, have nuclear material, fusion cores, etc and he killed me. Like the original post it's a pvp zone and again, I get it. But it seemed unnecessary to kill me as I was walking away
---
On that one I don't know they may have been doing something sketchy. For me I try to look for possible in game ways that people can do crazy things before I jump to they're cheating simply because I don't want egg on my face when it is just something in game. But I can't think of any reason you couldn't hurt them. Idk if the invincibility glitch is still a thing I hadn't heard about it in awhile.
---
Aw, I loved that quest if only for the hilarious list of laws each succeeding mayor makes to attempt to overrule the previous. 
---
Just award 1000 Atoms as a bounty.
---
Wow. Checking achievements is way more effort than I go through. Even ll alts need stuff though. I don't even know how to check others achievements. Is that in Social?
---
I've noticed it before but just assumed someone logged out while I was logging in, or someone had placed their camp right at the very edge of mine and just hadn't constructed anything noticeable yet.
---
But that does sound like an odd coincidence it happening to three of you at once.
---
I’m starting to think.. for the xp you can get way more from the ghouls at white spring in less time
---
He came after him, he wasn't defending his workshop he was out for low level blood
---
That makes sense, didn't see it mentioned before and Im pretty bad about skimming comments.
---
I tried that, and got into the game to log in. When I tried logging in, I received: "Login failed. This account lacks the required entitlements. [4:8:2006]"
---
Except the game tracks unique items that are  being rendered. This does nothing to the server.  
---
From what I heard the chainsaw just like the hunting rifle isnt in the legendary pool and it maxes and 20
---
Yes, I got the key from G2A and have a ticket open with them as well.
---
A real delicacy with sprinkled Mentats and some Spice on top.
---
I have only experienced my mods disappearing nothing else which is good so I don’t lose my weapons but still a problem 
---
Honestly, so far the "come here" emote has worked for me every time
---
Artificial difficulty to slow progress and waste time.
---
Fallout as a franchise had a fairly decent method to deal with strong weapons in low levels, like making the weapon less effect but still useable if you don't have the right stats/pre-requisites.
---
Other than that, you could also use the traits system that many games use to allow people to use different weapons at lower levels without being overpowered (Like Shitty Rifle vs Masterwork Rifle).
---
There are many solutions to this problem in the story of videogames, Fallout 76 picked one of the worst ones and even made it a step backwards in the franchise, since  the previous solutions the franchise had were better.
---
All in all, just another dubious design decision by the developers.
---
Thank you for sharing this. I appreciate a thought provoking story in the morning
---
No I wish though, also Wish they got buffed from melee perks. The one I have doesn't increase even with the +60% dmg increase from perks. Tried both one and two handed perks.
---
Yeah if you only care about technical performance, ballistic seems like the way to go. I like laser weapons mainly whenever I fancy drumming up some killer Star Wars-style moments. Why there isn't a lightsaber in this game is beyond me 
---
Also Yao Guai always drop springs.  And if you need lead, baby rattles are good for plastic/lead.  Pens are also plastic, hell if you need lead though, just scrap every kids toy you find, they all have lead paint
---
You probably know by now, but you have to find them and scrap them to unlock them. Or if you have the lever action plans, make them and scrap them.
---
I’m surprised with the 2 shot on it what have you been asking for it?
---
I swear, soon as I hit 50 I'm going to make it a point to clear out Top of the World, Blackwater Mine, Huntersville, Wendigo Cave, and all those other main quest locations if I spot a lowbie there.
---
I had a real "Ah ha!" moment this week. I was at the step where you need to go to Huntersville, and the place was swarming with lvl 50 - 68 supermutants. I'm level 35, so that was a non-starter. After a few failed attempts, I decided that neither the stealthy approach nor the aggressive approach would work, so I went back to my camp to craft a sniper rifle, hoping that maybe I could pick off the mutants from a distance. 
---
While crafting the gun I got disconnected and had to relog. Lo and behold, when I returned to Huntersville right after logging in, all the muties were level appropriate (save for the lone lvl 59 Primus, but that's what plasma grenades, miniguns, and power armor is for). 
---
It's kind of a dumb system, but it's consistent with previous Bethesda games. Destiny has a pretty elegant solution to the same problem ("How do you keep enemies reasonably challenging for all players in areas shared by low and high level players?"), but Bethesda would have to retool a shit ton of systems to make that work here.
---
Looks like we're stuck with the current system for the time being.
---
Yeah it does. This is a shitpost that clutters the sub and wastes everyone's time. 
---
I have extra plans laying around that I cannot sell to vendors, and cannot use. I let them go well below their value so some level-5 guy can survive better.
---
Replace your camp. It costs caps yes, but everything will get max repaired. 
---
There's still a bug with the Excavator armor that adds even more carry weight, though.
---
If you load into a world already wearing it, the carry weight bonus glitches and gets applied twice. Combine that with shocks and it's a whopping +300 to carry weight, perfect for hoarders! 
---
Don't think it helps that some people will just come and destroy you for the crac. I (lv36) and a friend (lv45) where building a camp only to get destroyed by lv60s and took our loot 🙃
---
As far as i'm aware with this particular game engine, they can't see if an item has been duped. Obviously Love it  or hate it... most of the former, but this was a port with very little foresight into how they would control exploits. 
---
One of my friends has a camp in the same spot as me. He was logging off for the night and I was taking his spot with our group. He had already left the team and logged out but when I logged in it said that my CAMP couldnt be placed. I logged on within a few minutes of him leaving. I was disconnected like 20 minutes later and joined in on team. It placed my camp. So it would seem there is like a cooldown period where it looks like the area is still occupied.
---
Also, it could be as simple as they dont have anything built and have just placed the actually CAMP machine down. 
---
Someone offered 4.5k for it 
---
Because believe it or not, when the game locks gear behind countless walls of RNG, it will take hundreds or thousands of hours to find everything you want. Meanwhile, many of the things you don't want are something that others want. It's almost as if they intended this to incentivize the trading system they created for the game
---
sorry for the delay with stuff, been sick as shit the past few days and not been up for getting on 76
---
i wasn't aware of this, ive also been fortunate enough to never see it happen i guess (as a heavy gunner).
---
id rather people stop spamming explosives and missile turrets over having the heavy gunners stop. 
---
Been experiencing the death glitch too. Enemies have the sound and animation of death.
---
Why only hundreds? I make thousands. Life is good. My "wooden boat" is 300ft long too, so nothing to sneeze at. Enjoy your sauna. You must feel quite filthy right about now :-D
---
Probably because it looks like your title accuses everyone in the sub of being the problem.
---
It’s expensive af tho 
---
Did you do anything you shouldn't?
---
Me too, it's such a fun weapon.
---
That's what I thought too. Was hoping to be wrong lol. Thanks
---
I was playing an alt lvl 30ish. went to the ammo factory. a level 90+ was hiding, just waiting for someone to claim it. Do we really need campers? Fresh content might help.
---
Yup yup.
---
Did you both have pacifist mode on at the time? 
---
What about the eyebot helmet and then just add a bunch of grime to your face or get a dark skin color
---
If I know a power armor location, how often does it spawn? Per play session? Per hour? Depends on...?
---
Some Black Adder reference? 
---
Problem is they're bad to the point of not being viable outside of maybe the gatling laser.  They simply don't do enough damage, even with burning effects and such to put down threat before it can get several hits on you.  Don't get me wrong, i'd love to play with something like a tesla rifle or cryolator, or even making my explosive laser into a shotgun, but it simply wouldn't be effective.
---
I just found that out...but I bought it anyway because it belongs in my barn 🙃
---
I don't think they do. I heard people say the same thing about the alien blaster, but I found a couple level 50 ones. However, I passed through the chainsaw spawn many times and did not ever find one that wasn't 20. Also, it doesn't even drop from legendary enemies. Flare guns, syringers, and drills drop from them even though they can't be legendary, but a chainsaw never drops, so it's likely not even intended to be legendary
---
They may have a higher spawn rate when hostile to other players. But I think you've just been unlucky sine they do spawn after you beat the quest. 
---
That's completely different than finding a stack of 100 legendaries just laying in a container. Sorry, there's no amount of spin you can try to convince me you thought that was just how the game worked.
---
Never had pacifist mode on except when it was mandatory until lvl 5
---
Holy shit fucking relax. This game isn't that serious. 
---
Did you guys launch it?
---
No. I have played legitimately the whole time.
---
Once more dungeons and vaults are opened for dlc there will be plenty of places for higher levels to go but at the moment it’s pretty much white springs uranium fever area and top of the world to farm titanium and legendary’s 
---
Underrated source of ballistic fiber too
---
WAIT NO THAT WAS THE WRONG ONE
---
The amount of hacking in this game is ridiculous though. Always my first thought
---
You gotta be really pathetic to come on here and whine because you got killed in a video game.
---
She was near the Whitespring Resort, near a train station, at a little mine area.
---
I found armor early, maybe level 5, and now at 15. I have found the increased inventory and advanced protection have made the survival part bearable, especially since I am focused on melee. I'll see if I can wait it out until 25, or see if I can find a core somewhere before 25. Thanks for the advice!
---
A legendary flare gun would be pretty sweet. Especially a TSE one haha
---
For sure, I was just saying. I also need to check if they become hostile while shooting your base, or if it's once they hit you. 
---
Shit give me an explosive anything and I’ll be your kid!!!! 
---
In my opinion there a very few players willing to pay good money for useless legendaries (ie Junkies 10mm pistol), and those low levels who will can not pay the caps to make it worth my time. I’d rather quickly unload my expansive inventory of weak legendary weapons on vendors instead of trying to track down an organic buyer for a couple extra caps. 
---
Overall, I’m still unclear why you don’t support some type of fix for duplicate single perk cards. I’m not suggesting that cards should be perpetually equipped giving a continual upside buff like in FO4, I would just prefer to make use of the “rewards” given for leveling up 5 times. It’s honestly just a simple fix. 
---
I understand that as a level 254 (and a level 240 yesterday) you have probably become disconnected with and forgotten the problems of level -100. I think I speak for most players when I say that not everyone spends enough time on this game to level up 14 times in a day; therefore even tho the value of perk cards is extremely diluted for you, they are still valuable for other players. 
---
Really? I could have sworn it was that one, let me recheck 
---
Now get an anime intro for this story
---
Sent you a message 
---
Where is harpers ferry?
---
Awesome tips...thanks so much...will give these a try! 
---
Responders - Level 25+
---
I bought it and the gilded one is the 2nd to last clock. Oh man I’m super bummed lol that was 1,000 Caps 
---
They go really far as well! I found this when avoiding a scorched beast.
---
Xbox? I’ll give you 500 caps for it. &gt;_&gt;
---
Uh huh. So it also counts as a fish?
---
I was thinking that the other day...hard to go wrong with dog food...
---
This post is so heart warming, I wish my Dad would give multiplayer games a try! 
---
Same experience here.  
---
I was doing the top of the world quest chain and was sent to the mine for key (the Uranium Fever event) at my lvl 23 I got owned by the lvl 40 moles.  
---
I almost gave up, but then decided to grind to 53 at whitespring golf and then returned to dab and flex on the now pathetic molemans.
---
This needs to be somehow tuned. Or just release some endgame content, the nuked golf and scorchbeast farm gets old fast  
---
I’ve sold tse weapons to maybe 200 people now. I’m not the problem. I truly hope the exploit is patched. Until then I will flood this game with every serum and weapon anyone could want. 
---
Can water fill my food meter? I have some perks and can drink any water with no rads. 
---
Update: Gilded Wall Clock is not the big white one. RIP 1,000 caps! 
---
12 year olds.
---
I think this is accurate. I solo play, but when I die in a lower level area I usually have the option to call for help or give up. In higher level areas I usually just get the option to respawn. 
---
Is there a quest that gives this stuff out? I started hopping to any available map quest and rarely get anything but a few stims and boiled water. I will get a random gun plan mod,  it that's pretty rare now too. Didnt know if I was doing the wrong quests.
---
Great tip! Thanks!!
---
Ah I’m sorry I forgot I didn’t even launch the nuke.
---
Uuum what about goldshire?
---
As our conversation goes:  
---
Friend - "I died"  
---
Me - "Dead *or* dead dead?"  
---
Friend - "I'm dead dead"  
---
Me - "Ok I'll guard your loot... aaand someone just stole all your springs"  
---
*The life of wielding TSE weapons.*
---
I am only at level 15 so have not journeyed too far into the many outskirts, although maybe I can branch out.
---
Fbm 
---
Gnomes are concrete?  Sonofabitch
---
Oh yeah I saw that...I will check into it...
---
I have one (ps4)... got it from an event in the mire. 
---
I'm partial to my Vampire Swing Speed +Strength Combat knife. It was my first 3 star.
---
I believe its the elegant wall clock, sold by the same Vendor in Whitesprings. 
---
Only time I saw him was when he saved my ass while defending my new airport workshop from other super mutants. Almost shot him until I saw him shooting them. 
---
Sounds like a good plan..it has no come up yet but I will keep an eye out for it...
---
I don't know why they do but i also found a dude who was duping and he had a 150 cap bounty on him.
---
Thanks. I’ll probably wait a while before dropping 1,000 more on a clock. 
---
Woof. 
---
Thats another favorite of mine but I never use it because ammo costs

Pay that no mind, DaVinci would get downvoted on Imgur. Most of the people who vote on images there seem to be imbeciles, especially those who immediately jump on new posts. I've seen posts quickly dive to -10 or more then climb up to something more average after some time has passed.
---
I keep a hardened combat w/ suppressor on my shotgun character (no perks other than concentrated fire to benefit the rifle) mostly for when I’m solo and conserving shotgun shells. I sneak and multi headshot a ton.  They do eventually spot you, but you are in PA and just keep hitting heads. I do run w/ 15 agility so that helps sneak or course, but usually don’t bother with a sneak peek ... just concentrated fire and heads. I imagine if I equipped some rifle perks it’d be easier, but they are not on my list for a while.
---
You're a raider though. You should be using sny underhanded tactics to win. But for those of us who don't have raider tags, we fight fair. 
---
You’re right it’s called the Elegant Wall Clock, I got those 2 mixed up.
---
This is a no anime zone 
---
I have all the water rad removal perks so I can drink any water. Need to get the food ones.
---
What does the gilded one look like?
---
To make up for your loss lul, there is a vendor that sometimes spawns at Charleston station that sells real cool clock plans, I bought a cuckoo and nuka cola clock from him. (It’s a responders protectron that hangs around the station).
---
I have been ignoring plants. Are they worth eating, collecting? They seems to be everywhere. 
---
I saw him on my alt, on the other end of the river across from New Gad, but I couldn't savor his presence bc I was running from enemies who were higher than my level. He was singing his meat song!
---
Bring it, RAIDER VS ENCLAVE! 
---
He probably was using this [exploit](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad6bxr/bethesda_please_fix_this_gamebreaking_damage/) with bobbleheads, doing so much damage that it blew through the pacifist protection.
---
Only the RNG can bring him. As near as I can tell he doesn't have a single route, but multiple. He will spawn on one, walk it for awhile and despawn. Sometimes when somebody finds him they'll "hold" him and come here to offer people a chance to come visit him.
---
Shit I'm a new player, I'll gladly take your free stuff!
---
Thank you. Definitely not my area of expertise and that did sound rather alarming.
---
Yes..I can cook. Probably could use more recipes. 
---
Lol wow.
---
Pretty sure explosive would make it worthless, since on other weapons it removes their special projectiles and turns them into regular bullets. It wouldn't even shoot flares, it would just be the weakest pistol in the game
---
Zzzz
---
He appeared outside the Mystery fan club for me, then later he was in the mine near Fort Defiance.
---
There is also a jetpack in the game
---
Like others said the problem is you can't defend without being locked into a forever conflict.
---
They should make it so if you die you can't attempt a workshop takeover for an hour.
---
Hell man a container loaded to the brim with shit? That's suspicious as fuck. I'm talking only about vendors with exploited gear. There should be a cap on container weight. 
---
It’s definitely not damage mitigation right? I haven’t seen enough of it to know for sure it’s not a feature, lol.
---
Patrol Duty at the penitentiary.
---
I had this issue with the XB1 and solved it with a "fit to screen" setting in the TV menu (Samsung). So it is probably related to the TV and not the console.
---
Yet Austin another thing thru could have learned from the ESO team. Limit your stacks to set amount depending on the item plus the weight. Also, FO4 did it right. If your weight was ridiculous then you couldn't move at all. Carrying 200lbs over is one thing, but lugging around the weight of the moon is another. 
---
I gave up, I'm just wandering the area doing daily quests and of course, theres supermutants that are level 59 and explosive wielding scorched EVERYWHERE
---
So in theory... Looking at other comments... Assuming it's true...
---
Pre xmas they implement an inventory tracker for characters.  Prior to this, they told at least 1 person they couldn't restore a lost item.
---
Now during holiday, at least one person submits a lost item requests and is told "after holiday".  Logically, an item tracker of some point server side was implemented.
---
Using that logic, they could now see that UserA logged in at 200lbs, logged out at 5000lbs. This flags an account for review.  They then see UserA has obviouslu duped (1000's of bobbleheads as an example).  Match them to crashlogs as well.
---
Coversely, they also run a query on unreleased items after UserB posts on reddit.  Sees UserB has given said items to others.
---
Both cases, ban ensues.
---
So are they biding their time to see how many they can catch in a single banhammer strike?  Or making sure they get all at once?  It makes sense to me.
---
This crate is quest related (I think the quest was for the responders and was called "Safe for work") and will be locked once the quest is turned in - Tho if somebody in the server has opened the crate it will be lootable for anyone in the server.  I use to loot this crate everyday it was the best, then I finished the Safe for work quest and I no longer had access to the crate unless somebody in the server had already picked and opened it.  
---
He probably saw your floating audio icon when you were talking to your mate :-D
---
I'm on Xbox, I'll sell it for 3k
---
Oh thank god. I finally found my people!!
---
It’s just a drop from enemies. I don’t think there’s any static ones on the map
---
Yea - I will repeatedly t-bag the bag or crate to get your attention too 
---
What happens in goldshire STAYS in goldshire!
---
I mean even if it is a glitch it ain’t a bad thing, more loot and xp for us boooooiiiisss.
---
Fair trade
---
Had 3 kids?
---
I think I have had it happen by accident. I had a small garden in my camp that I guess was ripe so when I moved it all that fruit become more plants which was fine the first time but but I had to move it again because apparently I keep picking bad spots and now I have like 40 mutfruit plants over 100 carrots corn etc. I hate it because I like having my camp be perfectly clear when I place my stuff and I don’t know how to get rid of them other then scrapping the plants which makes me place then scrap and it takes forever.  
---
I like to place my garden for others to use for starch as needed but every time I pack and move it exponentially expands. 
---
Graham finds you.
---
The fact that it would be worthless is what makes it so interesting. Leave the explosive off. Make it two shot and 250 damage resistance while reloading. 
---
yes, I'd also really like a "I'm sorry" emote because I have accidentally shot at other players with NO intentions of PvP and they always get nervous and I just want to be like, "accident!"
---
There's a lot of concrete near Site Charlie
---
Oouu this sound's great for spoiling their party! How can I find out this spot? I'd rather avoid the dupe videos and giving them more views.
---
I’ve run into him three times. Once very early in the game, not sure where, and twice on the road at Top of the World. Never had anything terribly good...

lol anybody that thinks 2000 is a lot would be baffled at my ammo counts..
---
Gilded is a wooden clock with a golden picture painted below the clock part. 
---
is there spaces?
---
Good on you. I've been wandering over to Vault 76 when I see new players and give them stuff. I had zero help when I started in the BETA so I'm trying to spread the love. 
---
You probably need to stop selling legendaries to vendors. There’s more efficient ways to make money that cost less weight. Just look at the value to weight ratios and you’ll see most aren’t worth holding to sell. You get better returns on aid you can craft with minimal input, bulking excess junk for sale, etc. All of that is besides the point, but legendaries are only ever worth selling to other players, not vendors. Just drop them in a container near a vendor and hopefully someone will benefit from your drop
---
There needs to be a null reward in perks. Perk packs aren’t meant to reward every time, and I think you’re expecting more reward. Getting single tier perk cards in packs is a null reward and do not clutter the menu. The only other way to randomize the reward is to take single tier cards out and replace that slot with no card actually being rewarded. Then at some point you’ll likely get a perk pack where the only reward is gum, and players report another “bug” that probably isn’t one. 
---
I don’t think there is anything that needs to be fixed, I think the the random chance at getting perks you care for in perk packs works as it should. Sometimes you get good stuff, and sometimes you get garbage. Kinda like how legendary drops or all RNG rewards/finds do.
---
We aren’t going to agree on this, but I’m not sure if you even see my point of view.
---
I am not sure why do you think you can be invisible? Its predator like overlay that still can be seen. About damage, he can be full sentinel armor (assassin + standing dmg) with some perks is invincible.
---
It depends on the individual server, and sorry i don't know the exact amount of time from when you take the armor or core till the respawn. I do know that ive have checked the same spawn for 3-4ish hours on the same server, and it didn't respawn yet so its probably more useful to server hop and check atleast 3 spots for a fusion generator like in Fo4, or a Power armor. If it helps so you know another spawn there is a barn that has a few traps in it has power armor and a generator right by "Mama Dolce's Food Processing" plant In the forest/Morgantown area.
---
I haven't seen any difference, I use the T60 legs (calibrated shocks/cheap repair) and torso (Kinetic Dynamo for VATS), and XO-1 for everything else. It just mixes the defense values in and gives you new numbers. 
---
Only wear the Vault-76 underarmor for PA, for now anyway, because anything else actually subtracts rather than adds if it has a defensive value.
---
I was hoping that too. It would increase the value of crafted weapons, which lack legendary effects but would last a whole lot longer per repair and be cheaper to use as a result. Would also increase the value of weapon artisan. 
---
The plans and special apparel is what I’m after from him. 
---
Why would you hide the name? People should just call these guys out honestly.
---
Tell me about it
---
Near some water plant. Was gonna build nearby anyhow cause of the river, but found a copper deposit! Mining anf farminh adhesive. A couple turrets for fun, workbenches, a bed, and a piano. All of it is unlocked.
---
Interestingly, i think im near a dual spawn point, cause everytime i load in, there are shots being fired, but my nase has never been attacked by mobs ha
---
Are you on now? What's your gt
---
I do wish there was more variety of pistols.  I enjoyed playing more varied gunslinger builds in the older fallouts. 
---
How did you utilize the railroad rifle to climb the building? Asking for a friend....
---
Yeah I haven’t come across that vendor yet but I was just after this specific clock. It looks like it was made to be in my barn. I’ll get it eventually. 
---
Yes. I use it on my heavy / demo character. I could spend like half my perk points on carry weight reductions, or just a few and wear the excavator. 
---
Others I use different armors, though I do keep a calibrated EXC ready in case I need to carry a bunch of crap. Even on the others you can get some decent carry weight boosts, plus better paint and a jet pack ;-)
---
I do have one character that I have ALL of the PA sets, but that’s because I’m a bit OCD
---
He clearly said "To Blaaaaiiittthhhh"
---
Yes. Platform?
---
Read a room bro. 
---
I said no, didn't I?
---
That's the answer.
---
Here's a funny solution, when you get a certain threshhold say around 300 pounds over your weight limit you start taking an exponential amount of health damage, which will make you drop all your loot.  You can't put excess loot into your stash, so it gets dropped into a baggy.
---
...I was expecting sillier...you disappoint me sir.
---
You can add mods to legendary weapons just like normal ones.
---
Rabbits can be found often over bridge west on south side of road.  Also west of the rooster or pheasant whatever it is south closer to Flatwoods supposedly you can sometimes find them I’ve heard.
---
There’s a lot of spawn points for Yao Guia but the civil war cemetery in NE of toxic valley (think that’s the name) is real consistent
---
I mean, their also cheating, and ruining it for everyone else playing. I'd have no sympathy 
---
Best of luck to you :) 
---
I would.
---
Party chat
---
Lol.   I haven’t really experimented w it yet.       I have been playin the game solo and staying away from dupers and trying to overkill the game itself
---
Not only is that an awesome story, that's also an awesome picture.  Kudos for capturing the moment so well!
---
Yeah but not from 30 meters away
---
I was referring to min spawn times when I mentioned the looting bit. Seems like the mobs wait to redrawn if loot isn't removed. It's wierd. I think it's the whole item count thing. 
---
It would be nice. It's sad that all the different factions don't mean shit in this game.
---
I don't understand.  People are saying they'll buy it for more than that in your actual selling post...
---
that was bethesda's reason back in beta. and when they increased it to 600, the patch notes said it would  go up more if the servers could handle it
---
So many "Bethesda, please fix this game, which is broken because I tried to break the game" posts. It's like you don't have a choice to cheat and destroy the game for everyone else. Also the whole "oh my friends saw a duper, and I just happened to catch this screenshot!" Fuck outta here with that totally unbelieveable crap. Everyone knows what you're doing.
---
Are you on pc? I need to buy a serum or 2.
---
On PC DamageDesu

I've played on and off and started multiple characters so I'm not against making a new one! Highest I had at one point was about 27 highest I have now is 13.

I'm more of an explore and have fun player over a grind and get best gear ASAP player. Most playtime is around 11:30pm Mountain Standard Time during the week and any time during the weekend! Feel free to add me.
---
I can’t wait to launch my first nuke. I’m only a level 22 and don’t play a lot, but it’s coming.
---
I'm sorry to hear of your loss, I bet she was an amazing woman. I lost my grandma back in September after a long fight with dementia. Nothing prepares you for the loss. I'd give anything if I could have 5 more minutes where she was back and had a clear mind. I need to find that bear in the rocking chair, I'd love to get a screenshot of it. Thanks for the great pic and the heads up that it's out there!

I have intelligence of 15, go to make some basic soup and the bar for cnd I'd a quarter vaway from touching the cnd word. Go to inventory vfor said item and condition looks like any other none made item.

Don't think cnd is being properly applied for intelligence.

They automatically scrapped when you ran out of steel.

I try handing off bunch of stuff too and they just keep running. Even after I drop a bag which I don’t think they notice.

I had the Whitesprings bug the other day it was awesome, not having to worry taking rads. 
---
I did Scorched Earth last night for the first time. I don't know if this is normal or not, like this is the case just for this event, but I wasn't taking rads even though it was a blast zone. I also brought some extra weapons with me because I figured my main ones were going to break, but they never did. 
---
Not really helpful on location, but I’d recommend looking for a junk pile to build near. You can build a junk harvester and get plenty of screws and such. The only problem with popular locations like that is having to replace your camp. The north near the water park is a pretty good place because it seems no one ever camps up there, but central? Can’t help ya with a good one.
---
Now we just need a few dupers for tse 10mm usable by low lvs
---
15k ultracite ammo is kinda questionable as well.
---
This level 106 guy keeps following me! I can’t get to the quest, he just sits there menacingly with a brown bag at his feet! Someone help!!! Haha
---
Depends. Killed by an NPC? Is dead dead. Killed while you were wanted? Dead dead
---
Killed by some random murder hobo? It'll respawn on login a couple of times
---
Good on ya sir!
---
It'll be easier to kill them, steal their stuff, and laugh at them if they think people are nice!  
---
Where does that come from?
---
I saw that someone said that someone offered 4.5, but I don't see the actual offer. I just want the 18 lbs gone and don't use heavy. First 3k takes it off my chest 
---
Might’ve been, he was playing this morning. So far he hasn’t left the Flatwoods/Overseers Camp area. He’s pretty happy just hanging out there and not progressing through the story at all.
---
I'm too late but you want the elegant clock. I am sorry for your cap loss. 
---
You sound like a furniture collector. Any idea which vender sells the metal picnic table or the laser trip wire plan and what they would be called? 
---
Countering points and making a mistake in who I was responding to does not invalidate my points, and personally the fact you instantly resorted to personal attacks makes me believe I clearly hit a nerve.
---
Try r/FO76filthycasuals :) Might be more what you’re looking for
---
Typically, at least in other games, that’s against the EULA so yes they should be as well. Hard to narrow that one down though. 
---
I've taken to just monitoring the vault 76 location on the map from time to time and if i see someone in there  I'll fast travel, drop a bag of supplies on top of the metal crate next to the railing directly in front of the vault door,  and sit on the ground next to it using photomode. Then i take a pic of them getting their first breaths of Appalachian air in 25 years with the "our future begins" frame.
---
I think if the CND of the food is about or close to expire/spoil it has a chance to give you a disease.
---
It's not an urban myth, the data is in the game files, just like how some of us know exactly what is on the loot tables, we look at the data.
---
I thought it was a perfectly logical question. As said yes you can mod away without removing the legendary effect. Just don't scrap it by accident which I still do on occasion. 
---
We never need dupers. Ever. For anything. 
---
Yeah I was literally on the last two Mirelurks of the defense event, all the turrets were busted and I wasn't going to waste time repairing them.
---
What's his username
---
Only reason to dupe at that level is to sell for real cash. They sell the items to players and vendors, then sell the caps to other players, so they can buy this shit over and over.
---
I can't see making the game easy by duping so you don't have to gather at all. The game would be boring. 
---
You don’t get a chance to use a stimpak when lil’Timmy snipes you with an explosive shotgun from a mile away 
---
It would be cool to be able to do a leather face cosplay with it
---
T60 legs due to easy to find calibrated shocks and repair cost.
---
X-01 torso and helm for rad resist and looks.
---
T60 arms for pink\purple hotrod paint color (used to be 51b for defense)

Same here. I stopped playing after 3 crashes/lockup’s in a span of 10 minutes on Saturday morning.

Not much that I've noticed, and I use them a lot. And they can go on EVERYTHING. Leave a note on extractors telling passerbies to help themselves, turning a Trash can into a Stash can, mildly vandalizing other signs and wall decor (Have you taken your CHEMS today?) 
---
Super handy. 
---
Nuked zones stay irradiated for awhile after a nuke
---
This thread is great lol.
---
I'm afraid I have no idea, for the sake of testing I simply looked up pin ups and that was one of the pics I found
---
Avoid G2A, they are known for reselling stolen keys or keys bought with stolen credit cards ...
---
&gt; you then use the fact that it isn't balanced to your advantage
---
If only the same advantage was available to the other people...
---
Any chance I could get one?
---
Because the meat pile isn’t where you expect it, especially if you are blowing them up with explosives.
---
They should make events/game modes that only use certain weapons. Like everyone gets batons except one guy with a chainsaw or a mole miners gauntlet. 
---
I would get BOS t60 paint job raises stats and then I would get Calibrated Shocks. Then you have a very high stat Power Armor with very low Repair costs.
---
High traffic?
---
Across the street from Pleasant Vally Train station. Junk node just off the highway and you can place your camp on the road. Ppl WILL see a house sitting on the road. And train stations are high traffic. 
---
The Graham moves in mysterious ways. Just listen out you'll normally hear him taking too Charly moo moo before you see him. 
---
We found a super duper!
---
Again, I don't consider contesting a workshop bullying. 
---
They were ignoring my voice coms where I told him he could have it if he just let me finish the defense event and stopped attacking me, and were chasing me around while I was killing the last mirelurks, even ignoring the workshop table to chase me almost all the way to Grafton Dam.
---
Gun Runner, Focus Fire, and decent Perception.
---
The revolver guy is a mid-to-close-range build that remain highlybmobile at all times.
---
I can post the build I went with if you'd like. I was crit one-shotting asshole players in full X-01 more than 30 levels higher than me by level 40, and killing ghouls has never been easier.
---
The problem with Destiny's system is that it effectively nullifies character progression outside of legendary effects, as you'll deal and take a static percentage of damage regardless of level or power level. Both games would benefit from a middle ground.
---
Can something please be done about mob LOS? I realize the light and audio occlusion is probably too deeply buried in this ancient engine to fix, but it's ridiculous that literally every NPC in the game sees infinite distances through walls.
---
I've tested this extensively since I was beginning to doubt my sanity and have video. Anyone else who wants in on the fun: go to Watoga and notice Phoenix and the Bots (great band name) standing still, shooting at each other from 100 yards away THROUGH WALLS, aimed with pinpoint accuracy at where their target would be - without those pesky walls.
---
Go into a large interior filled with baddies, like AVR medical. Load in stealthed. Go into a dark corner. Fire one single unsilenced shot.
---
Every NPC in the building instantly knows exactly where you are. They all come running, some firing at you BEFORE they've come into LOS. They have your exact position, even if you move while remaining stealthed in the dark out of LOS.
---
In all cases, I can enter a worldspace, find a nice corner, fire one shot, then proceed to clear the building by *not moving* and just taking free shots at the shooting gallery that presents itself to be murdered as they charge around the nearest corner already firing directly at my position.
---
It's a little silly.
---
Im dying for more Firebreather gear/camp items
---
Kinda, I just don't like how people will be like "I don't like this person for "x" reason they're a cheater". People will be crying wolf so much Bethesda won't take the reports seriously. Then nothing will get fixed.
---
GT is Mercedes Jennz, have her hit me up with a message if she wants help and I can team up with her to help her out.
---
Then the loot stood up and clapped.
---
Its on their profile.  It's a few second thing.  If I am going to break a quest and fast travel, just want it to have max impact.   But not saying any way is wrong to "just give".
---
I am 46 and I am a gamer and it's funny when I come across kids who say I'm too old to game I wanna punch me lol. Your never to old to have fun besides you little shits I was gaming before you were even born lol. I started out with a taxi if that tells you anything :)
---
I love this. I lost my dad several years ago and playing fallout always makes me think of him. He gave me my love of computers and games and when fallout 3 came out he loved to watch me play because he and my mother lived in the DC area before I was born. He would ask me to find places he knew and if they were in the game I would show him how it looked in the fallout universe. He was born in West va so when I play 76 I think of him often because I know he would have loved seeing some of the weird stuff that has happened to his home state.
---
I'm glad you were able to have this fun time with your son &lt;3
---
That would be interesting, doesn't the battle that never was work like that? Or do they not require black powder weapons?

There is an electricity station north of watoga where I guarantee you at least 1 deathclaw will spawn, it might be above your level but I’m not too sure. Try it out tho. 
---
I was at top of the world a few days ago to start two missions I had. I'm level 20 but had no chance against lvl 40-50 molemen and their glowing pets. I was a bit out of lucky because the higher leveled players didn't do much, they probably went through their stash so I just ignored that area and moved along with my exploration
---
I want wooden signage pretty bad anyway, so yes!
---
I prefer weapons that actually do damage to my enemies. I just scrap every single Energy weapon.
---
I can post the perks I went with if you'd like. It's a very effective build.
---
There are several bugged recipes where you can't make the item even if you have the ingredients so the recipe itself is probably bugged.  The only other recipes I've found that you can't build are 3 steeped \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ tea recipes and the Tasty Stingwing Stew recipe which can't even be learned.
---
1gb of vram? Won't nearly be enough. That is what is probably being the issue.
---
could be possible too
---
Yeah I'm just jumping through missions on the side
---
yea, [https://www.falloutmaps.com/](https://www.falloutmaps.com/) deselect everything and reselect power stations in the location tab. you have to hover over them to get the name though.
---
That’s nuts!  First of all we have been together damn near ten years also (closer to about 8.5 really,) and he introduced me FO3 when we first started dating.  I was really into games but for some reason thought it looked boring.  He had just bought a PlayStation 3 but wasn’t really that into it, and he bought FO3 as like a starter game.  We worked opposite shifts at the time and I worked nights, so on my days off I would play all night and he would curl up on the couch next to me.  Good, good memories.
---
Something was interfering in the camp placement for that particular server.  It could be another camp is there.  Log out and back in to switch servers.  Your base should be placed then.
---

sry ps4 :/
---
Just means someone already had a camp in your spot if you re log into another server it could be there or you'll get the message again, but if you do move it it is free and you can rebuild somewhere that someone else might not have built at.
---
Google might have your answer. 
---
This makes a lot of sense.  I constantly see radium rifle plans and seemingly nothing else.
---
I feel like this was a snafu'd attempt at making levelled lists for availability of item plans.
---
 Somebody was probably putting it together and say "handmade gun" and thought,  "oh that's probably something low tier like the pipe guns, let's just put this in the low levels".
---
&lt;3
---
You're still displaying your lvl of nolifeing 🤔
---
Just server hop. It means someone else currently on that server has a camp to close to where you originally built yours.
---
Thanks for the replies. It's given me some things to think about. See ya in the wasteland. My name is Necroplexxus (lvl 66)
---
I only use melee weapons, and I leave *tons* of ammo for players, they rarely take it though. 
---
I've not disagreed once with the idea of having 500,000 of any one bobble head, nuka cola or something similar being a sign of a duper...
---
And as long as we are talking about 1,000 of the exact same legendary (or 100, or 50) item including durability etc as well..
---
Originally jumped in, and have gotten down voted and mocked because I had a problem with the **"Ban anyone with more than X of anything"**, it's possible to naturally loot duplicates of Legendaries..
---
I've got about 6 (of a few thousand) Legendaries that stack (aka identical) picked up naturally, I think they are all 1*'s..
---
I haven't noticed anyone even bothering to nuke Prime, even once, since New Years.
---
They could also just disable weapon stacking, at least in the midterm, until they work out a proper fix for players desynchronizing with the server.
---
Hey we all do it, especially if we are also playing the game :)
---
Will do! Thank you!
---
44yo mom here who adores fallout. I think I've loved it because if (the stories the character development the world OF COURSE) the VATS system, i suck at first person shooting, when enemies are on me I panic so the VATS system was a godsend for me. I'm doing OK in FO76 but I go through ammo like you wouldn't believe (again, because I suck and can't aim for shit). 
---
My 16yo son will sit next to me sometimes and he's a frickin wizard who kills everything in the blink of an eye so I will hand him the controller and he'll kill things for me when I know I can't do it with the limited ammo I have.
---
I bought a headset hoping we could play together or even join a team or something but so far no go, I'm a lone ranger. He'd rather play The Division I think.

Ah well I'm still having fun. Jealous of you though!
---
It is called traffic light. 
---
You clearly hoped that posting such a snarky and rude reply to the original question would build you a great up vote response. I'm glad to see it's blown up in your face and that you're losing votes. Clearly people don't like it when you try to be funny by attacking others unnecessarily.
---
You've got so much experience on here too! Well, at least your account shows that you do. Its a lesson you should have learned ages ago! Unless  you're using someone else's established account.
---
When someone puts the effort into asking a fair question, say something helpful or don't say anything at all. Otherwise you're just blatantly a predictor trying to prey on others and deserve every bit of negativity you get as a consequence. 
---
If you wrote that terrible response out of carelessness and you didn't mean to be mean, then cant you remove it or apologise for coning across like a grade A wiener. You can see you're getting down voted, so again, don't try and justify your lame attempt at playing Mr.wise cracker. 
---
Admit you've been mistaken or try to explain yourself without attacking. 
---
You can add me, username is 101001101100. Ill give you any help i can.
---
If I am going to help, want to make sure it's welcome and not intruding on someone's "mule".  Plus three of my friends in the lvl 100's started from scratch and want NO HELP.  So it kinda made me wonder if others who run away are in some sort of pure quest walk through.
---
Ok...so you agree with me. The dude is a nolifer.
---
My only weapons are TSE, so that may not be fair. 
---
I’ll keep them for you though, I’ll even stockpile some more. I always run into scorched.
---
So many people post this, but let me offer an *actual* solution. Just drop your stuff there, and leave 😯. I know, it seems crazy to not get recognized for your philanthropic approach to the game, but someone will still pick up the loot, and have good time with it, whether they know who dropped it or not.
---
Your sharing will be an inspiration to us all. Let the great giving commence.

Have plenty of radaway in case the SB decides he hates you more than the dozen robots attacking him. Gaus rifle FTW

Okay
---
If you already have possession of the workshop, you get more plans each time you successfully defend and hold it. 
---
Ah I bet that it was revoked then. Thank you, I will open a claim with the seller through their resolution center.
---
I think they should have a symbol stating you're in pacifist mode, so they know they're safe. 
---
They're in the game, i saw one in a building i was prospecting in yesterday
---
Thankfully(?) you can't scrap legendary weapons. 
---
Workshops are about efficiently building.  There is a set number of "free" building materials in each one. Pick workshops that have resources you need, I like lead, and build a little spot to craft bullets or fix armor. Just build what you need, if you build everything, all the crafting stations, water etc., then someone will probably steal it.  Some workshops are valuable if built out, so you need to protect them with turrets too.  If you do all that, you end up spending your own materials, so you better be ready to defend it.
---
You can also grab a workshop just for its free fast travel. grab one in a area you plan to come back to. dont need to build anything.  The defend missions and such are all optional, dont feel pressured to jump out of anything you are doing just to go defend. it will stay yours and fast travel still works, you will just have to clear it out later if you need to build something.
---
You get tons of experience points from building and defending, extra free resources, and fun little optional events.
---
&gt;Bring back the "Block" option.  You can only "Block for Session" via the social menu on the left.  The "Block" option was removed at some point.
---
Hey Bethesda! Go ask your Legal folks about what happens when someone being harassed online is forced to re-enable their harasser every time they log back in - and unless the perp is online they can't even temp block them! Maybe that'll pry a few shekels out of the greedballs who think storing a persistent Block list is "too expensive."
---
&gt;Measly bit of junk
---
Okay, then you go ahead and give me your adhesives, screws, and rad mats if you value them so poorly. 
---
There are a few double extraction sites around the map as well if you’re interested in passive farming. 
---
Junk/lead: east of Black Bear Lodge 
---
Acid/lead: north of Lake Elouise 
---
Black Titanium/lead: near Lewisburg (NW side never been to this one, so unconfirmed)
---
Honestly to fix the problem of using containers they just need to not let us put things in world containers. But you can also dupe just by dropping the stuff in question because the dupe glitch revolves around forcing a roll back on your character. So you do whatever it takes to make your connection unstable then just unload what items you want then when you re log into the same server you'll still have said items in your inventory but the ones you unloaded will also still be there. So the best fix they could do is to find a way to not use the roll back system. One way I think they could do this would be to keep our inventory data saved on the server instead of our account.
---
I'm not sure if its the same event or not, but the verses event at Prickett's Fort where you fight as either Confederate or Union, that one does not require black powder guns.
---
You should become a writer if you aren't already, you're very good at it. 👍
---
Yesterday in the first 30 mins of playing I got disconnected from server 3 times !?
---
I play on pc. And also noticed the mods I’ve purchased are now missing in my storage crate !? How can I get those back ??
---
I’m hanging in there but this is really frustrating will many hours spent on the game from all us players and bugs don’t seem to be getting better 
---
I don't care about up or downvotes, that is a really dumb thing to worry about.
---
Posting a one line question that has been answered many times before is hardly "fair", it is lazy.
---
I haven't been mistaken and stand by my post which both gave the answer and asked OP to put in a little more effort on their part. I don't really owe you or anyone else any more explanation than that.
---
Downvotes mean nothing. Upvotes mean nothing. I say what I feel, and people can agree or not as they see fit.
---
I don't see why Grafton is so contested either. 
---
Steel is easy to get from scrapping short hunting rifles, pump shotties, etc that you get from killing groups of muties or scorched. 
---
Lead is a bit tougher to gather but other workshops, like Posedion Energy, produce lead as well. 
---
That's the same one haven't done it so I wasn't sure
---
I know.  But like the post said, there hadn't been a nuke in at least two hours (or more) that I had been logged on.
---
Things were also re-spawning as if a nuke event was in process.
---
Could be, I think givers just try lots of ways and it's what works for you.  It's good to read about how others do it.  I like ideas, don't have to be mine to be great.  Same thing with the CAMP thread, people are amazing getting them in all sorts of crazy spots.
---
Not a collector, I do like customizing my camp but I usually just do events to get plans. I’m afraid I don’t know where to acquire those plans, sorry! 
---
The "tin foil hat" theory of this being a plan by Todd Howard to get more staff could be on to something...
---
Friend looked on the TX Bethesda page and they have a ton of job postings up...
---
So either that or half the studio was axed ;)
---
lol they're prolly at top of the world for the aluminum 
---
Balance them all over the map.  The current setup is just silly.  They either need individualized scaling like in ESO or whole maps for certain level ranges like in Division.  The former would probably be better, but the latter would probably be easier to implement.  Current setup is awkward for low and high levels.
---
I play in the exact same way you do. Anyone who makes fun of you to be mean-spirited is just insecure about their own shit, and doesn't deserve your attention. Good on you for breaking up with him. Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
---
It was never a thing, just people not realizing someone had requested an item + a bad trade system.
---
Just pay attention to what is being traded.
---
People will also use it to look at your items.  They probably wanted to see what legendaries dropped for you.
---
Thats exactly what i was thinking, op is probs a duper.
---
Bullying is going to claim a workshop with your four high leveled melee 1hit killer party, claim your workshop after killing you quite a lot of times, and then leaving the server.
---
Which happened to me three times since I've been playing. It's not really a problem.
---
We don't know if it even existed in the first place or if people made it up as there was no video evidence and only happened to a few people.
---
Yeah they kinda suck power-wise but I completely get why the developers have 'needed" to dampen them. Laser weapons are far more visually straining that ballistic. 
---
When you're creating an online game, you need to try and make sure the vast majority of players concentrate on using weapons that are the least visually demanding. If 80%+ of all players all ran around using laser rifles all the time because they were awesome, my guess is, the game would crash far more than it already does. 
---
They should have made them powerful but just incredibly rare. Then it would be like, "wow! That crazy guy has a laser weapon! It looks bloody amazing!"
---
party leader doesnt matter. but yeah letting the lower level travel first to spawn lower level enemies works
---
Mines gt is the grateproter
---
i'm PC. Thanks for offering up though
---
He didn't break any rules though...
---
Please elaborate, what do you mean disable weapon stacking? Like you're unable to have 2 of the exact same weapon?
---
You forgot "sterilize them". Somewhat redundant but still.
---
Getting one-shotted without warning and paying big caps for the privilege of falling over dead while the shooter logs out of the server isn't "PvP" it is murder, stealing and running away. These guys are not interested in the workshop or the materials; they are murdering players, stealing their caps and logging off. They are griefers and are abusing the system in order to profit.
---
You got fingers my man, a quick google or reddit search can bring it up. 
---
I know where that is. [https://i.imgur.com/petbqSq.png](https://i.imgur.com/petbqSq.png) Great location. The tea party is right in your front yard yeah ? There's a lockpickers wet dream of a trailer right below that cliff to the South. Where are you trying to build now and what platform ?
---
someone did this to me last week and was like naa man I don't need it waited for him to get in a fight jumped into the line of bullets and shot him in the face grabbed the junk dropped it into a fissure when he came back was like thanks for the springs good luck finding the bag in that grass
---
a hour later walked by he was still in the grass looking for it
---
make my own fun....
---
Possibly different stats when upgraded.
---
Looks cooler?...idk but that bomber jacket is hella disappointing. I can craft all 3 Bo's under armors and mod them. Wonder if we will get more down the line.
---
Am I doing something wrong or does it take a good while to level up? I see people everywhere like 100+
---
Salty much, these stupid posts always make me laugh, the moment they ban dupers this game is finished, that's most likely over half their players banned.
---
I snag can chimes every time I see them just for the steel and lead.  Tin cans and aluminum cans are my life blood lol.
---
I didnt do any crafting or anythin that needs junk or any resources, was wandering around had to back out to main menu for a second then after logging in they gone

---
It lasts for like 2-3hours then "goes away" but it's only the rads and the orange glow that goes away glowing ones and flora remain. Its bugged a few times for me like that.
---
No the same. 
---
How do you get calibrated shocks? By disassembling Excavator pieces?
---
I'm pretty sure he was speaking in context of the game. Of course being a bully IN THE GAME is not the same as IRL. Seems like that should go without saying.
---
I wondered about that since the noise on that thing is just way too much.  Thanks for sharing!
---
Only under armor I can't craft is enclave...but I can mod it.
---
yeah that would suck in fallout. armor would become useless for DR. i dont mind the way it is now tbh
---
they really need tiers of defenses though a high lvl player in decent armor can basically walk through a wall of rocket turrets and even mortar fire does nothing more then annoy 
---
Wow, never knew I could farm these suckers there!!! 
---
Flatwoods is the best one near 76. I dump stuff in there constantly.. The overseers camp is okay too, but has a pretty low weight limit. 
---
The damage is already done..  Everywhere you go everyone us rocking 2se weapons... People on 76market have whole lists of all 2se weapons....  Yeah totally legit lmao one of my new years resolutions is to never support Bethesda again.  Make ES6 idc anymore.  At this point you better give out free soup with each copy. I bet they never say a word about duping.  They don't care about fixing the game why care about duping?  
---
Hi there! I don’t come to this sub ever but here’s my two cents!
---
The last update was not a month ago. The 19th of December is not a month! It’s more like 2 1/2 weeks! Check that math
---
TC, If you claim to know how to fix their game bc you’ve been a game developer for 23 years, then you must not have been paying attention for those 23 years! You don’t know how their game works on a development level. If you do, cite some credentials, tell us what you do as a “game dev”, or just be another voice on reddit!
---
It was just a holiday, so no shit they’re taking time off! They likely won’t be able to again until it’s fixed so your salt will be sated then!
---
For real tho that last point! Holy shit that last point! They’re humans! Stop acting like you’re entitled to take away every freedom from developers just because higher ups signed a check they couldn’t cash! They made a pretty shitty game? The publishers seemed to not care! Boycott softworks instead! Stop demanding people be ripped from their families to fix a game that *will not be fixed in the two weeks since the last patch* hell, they could’ve taken less than a week off, seeing as they said their next update is a big one, naturally it’ll take longer
---
Like I said before, I don’t use this subreddit! I got a suggestion on my google homepage to look at a picture of a nuke launching and decided to check the front page. From the outside looking in, posts like this are fucking gross. I mean your post about “snowflake culture” because they took fucking Christmas off lmao. Oh well, you’re a veteran game dev, not me
---
got into the locked armory for the free states that way not a lot of loot in there
---
Well they look the same is what I'm saying. I could be wrong, but I thought the knights wore a different colored underarmour in other games. I agree though,  that bomber jacked is doodoo. 
---
I believe it may be that every time you log on and get the message that your camp can't be placed it makes a new blue print
---
Thank you the advice on legendary weapons. You are right stims, meds, etc are better to sell. 
---
I get what you’re saying about RNG games, random loot drops, and chance. I understand how you see it that way, but again the single level duplicates can not do anything. They entirely a waste of code in the game. Like I already said, legendary drops are still in some way usable, sellable, or equitable buy players. Do you understand the difference?
---
If you do, you should then, like me, be questioning their inclusion in the game?  Why not just make it a null perk like you said? It seems like it was a detail that was over looked; I simply want a to be able to get a usable perk in a trade. 
---
I’m very certain now that the primary reason you do not support this is because you are so high a level it doesn’t matter for you or you have been lucky enough to avoid this problem and you do not understand it. 
---
I do have one thing. I killed one there when I was there by myself and the beast just chilled and got shot at by the turret but then two of my friends fast traveled to me and the beast wouldnt stay by the turret. I'm not sure if I got lucky or if this only works solo but just be advised 
---
If you killed a non hostile player they become wanted if those players become wanted then they are just chipping away at health if they aren't it's a exploit 
---
I didn't think of this, I can't mod them quite yet to verify. 
---
It should be easy to implement - if an item is favourited by a user, it has a heart shown to the user/owner and a not for sale icon shown to the buyer. 
---
I'll expect my cheque in the mail Bethesda. 
---
You can talk about vendors, but that isn't what the discussion was about.
---
You cant craft sweet rolls with sugsr bombs made in thr factor y
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
it would have been nice to have more than 7 seconds to let my eyes actually focus :P but it's worth it for the soundtrack alone. Have you ever seen Boneless Filet of Excavator? 
---
me and a friend (both 50+) helped a 3rd guy out lvl 18 handed him 100 molatovs then he would chuck them into a cluster and we would murder it was lvl 38 in a single session 
---
no, the CAMP duping is an actual bug if you move your camp without storing your things first.
---
For some reason my second to last paragraph duplicated the first paragraph upon uploading the comment, so I tried to fix it to how I had it as best as I could. Basically that's what I had intended to say was that players would be unable to put any items into any container of any kind the weight would be x/0 x being the items that naturally spawn in container and 0 would be the weight limit of said container. Which would mean you can't place anything in the box, but it can be filled from a natural spawn.   
---
I didn't know about the roll back, though I do think I have heard that from somewhere. Would the inventory data saved on server instead of account effect other players who don't exploit as say you're playing solo, disconnect or leave to go do something, come back to a new server and all your stuff is gone? Could it possibly save to both server and our account, but overwrite the account if you do happen to load into the same server?
---
When they are duping they crash their connection to the server, not the server itself.
---
It fathoms me that they still have not hotfixed this in such a way to STOP it. Their hotfix simply made it one step harder to do.
---
It also bothers me that they were banning people from the game for modding skins instead of banning people this a history of using the dupe.
---
I'm going to guess they programmed every item in the game to have its own unique ID because thats how their game engine works but its so lazy and limiting.
---
There are 3 different bos designs. 2 are identical while one is black. Not sure which is called what tbh. But they serve zero purpose other than color.
---
Was in there today. Couple cave crickets and a couple of ghouls. Ok, not too bad, even though I hate the crickets. I pressed on.
---
Glad I didn't listen to the tour guide thing. Came face to face with a glowing wendigo. 
---
Seems like the enemies are random in there. Was there before and just had radrats. 
---
Yeah you should expect people to claim them, but the first time I went to a workshop someone came and harassed me for like an hour or two and never even tried to take the workshop himself just came to attack me and my friend who were both low level. That’s bullying, only came to attack us even after we left an hour later we checked and he never claimed workshop it was still ours 
---
Seriously, that was a missed opportunity. 
---
I hate being killed.  If I die because a super mutant kills me, that's fine. I don't like it but it was under my control.  If A real person kills me, I have a hard time. I feel like I got killed, for real.  As such, online gaming has been a giant no show for me.  Until 76.
---
I have been "Murdered" twice.
---
I can handle that.
---
Of course, also collect boiled water and make some soup. Soup counts for both water and food!
---
I have seen at least 10 different people today on the facebook pages say that they kill people at will who haven't engaged them back. One guy complained of getting OHKO'd while crafting power armor in pacifist mode.
---
I noticed a great many times how the tag will say legendary and drop shit....but ones marked bloated dip shit....drop legendary gear..  Idk bugs wild lol
---
Everyone has their way to play, some like the stealthy sniping approach, others love the heavy gun loud approach, myself I love the get in your face and punch everything to death approach, either way there is no right way to play a game, the most important thing is that you enjoy the game and the story at your own pace.
---
Lol nope
---
yeah a locked function would be grand that stops recycling / sales / dropping 
---
also should remove it from trade screen
---
I just hate how its really back and fourth because everything is a one shot kill. Really whoever shoots first wins and its pretty annoying. Its not PvP as much as it is taking turns...
---
Love this idea. Not because I care about my shops but no one caps them anymore and they used to be great spots to lure people into pvp.
---
Well you could just go launch a nuke, that should autocomplete it for you
---
i'd love to help to, new to in FO76 too on PS4. 
---
Naw, I'm just a dick
---
If you're on PS4, I'd he happy to give you some veggie starch and screws. Not sure if I have any rad materials though.
---
I use the sort option set to spoil to get all my crafted food to appear grouped at the bottom of the menu.  I'd prefer it if it sorted the crafted food to the top, but I'll take what I can get.
---
Traditional Chitlins and tasty Stingwing stew plans I have found,  clicked on them and it does nothing. So I've learned them but they don't show up even when I have the require ingredients to make the dishes. 
---
Will return after I try the steeped out. I could have sworn I made the thistle one once. 
---
Right,  the officer uniform is black, and the knight and scribe are orange. You can mod them, but idk if the stats are the same. There *should* be an olive color for knights. 
---
may check [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad6bxr/bethesda_please_fix_this_gamebreaking_damage/eddzphe) before you accuse someone of duping...    
---
Moreover ammo smith + super duper = 180 ultracite .50 with 30% chance of becoming 360 bullets **per violet flux**. It's not that it would take dozens of hours of farming to get 15k .50 ultracite....
---
Question.  Does the workshop location affect the plans it gives out?  Like if one is in the Mire would defending that one give better plans?  
---
I’m not on at the moment. Maybe later
---
You think so? Can it be completed when its not even in my quest tab?
---
No, you have death counters which you get by failing death throws, but you can instantly doe if something does more than your total max hp in one hit, and you automatically gain a death counter every time you are hit after going unconscious.
---
Sorry for ranting but I like D&amp;D slot and don't get to talk about it nearly enough.
---
Kinda, yeah. You knew it was shady shit when you picked it up. 
---
Is there an outbreak of violence inside the resort at whitesprings? I go in to shop and there are dead bodys spread out randomly. Not a group of them.just a lone bot face down and a Mr handy nearby bitching about having something else to clean up.
---
yeah I'm excited to see how much new things gets added for them 
---
I'd love paint jobs for all the armors in them
---
Ohh how we all know that pain too well. 
---
Saving on both could work but then you run the chance of people using save editors on the save data from the platform and that would overwrite the server side making the changes permanent. I was thinking if they could have a part of the server cluster be dedicated to storing inventory data and whenever you connect the server your on accesses your inventory from there. It might increase load times but it could fix the problem.
---
I was farming a nuke at whitesprings (not mine), and a lvl 100+ was downed. I was only lvl 60ish. 
---
Never met the guy, or chatted with him, yet happily moved through the throngs of glowing to stimpack him. 
---
Sometimes everyone can need a helping hand. 
---
It makes the game much more fun to me when users collaborate, than to snipe each other with TSEs in pvp. 
---
You mean a flare?
---
That is sweet... I wonder if you can ride the missile
---
Say what again. Say what again. I dare you. I double dare you motherfucker. Say what one more god damn time.    
---
Just so I'm clear, when you clicked the Stingwing recipe did it get consumed like you learned it or is it still in your inventory?  For me it's still in my inventory and I didn't learn it.
---
I’m 28 and lost my dad two years ago. One of my favorite memories is playing the original halo coop over Xmas break and beating it together. Trust me your son will cherish these moments. Cheers! 
---
I used to have my house there and watched every nuke I launched
---
You specifically said stack of legendaries laying about, that could mean in a paper bag, in a box, or in a vendor as they are for anyone to grab. 
---
Sneak Life! I do, however, pop chems like candy. 
---
found this with a friend he tried to stand on the 2nd one but wouldn't fire him
---
I love stories like this. My friend is super high level and has done literally everything you can in this game. Now he spends all his time making resources for low levels and giving them out randomly, helping them level up, and answering any questions they have. The cool thing he’s not the only high level person I see doing this. Despite this games long list of issues, the community is definitely one of the best I’ve seen in a game so far, and makes the game very fun to play. 
---
Dont think it was him but I still love this community
---
Found her dead next to fissure prime last night, I think she wandered into the wrong area 😢
---
Its asinine you would type out a paragraph instead of giving the definition or moving on with your life.
---
No6oe but with the over repair it sharpens it by quite a bit. Played around with one with the double blade mod, and the right perk cards and it was one shotting people over lvl 50.
---
The plans and mods for excavator calibrated shocks are sold by vendors in the Dark area of the map (bottom left). 
---
I did not see anybody even close to me on the map for a flare to work. Radio call for help would have probably worked better.
---
push to talk had 100+ posts and it got in game the squeaky wheel gets the grease 
---
What platform?
---
Lol GDI.....now wtf do I do with my life?...sooooo lost now
---
I say wipe the whole game.  My toon is 196 and everything I have I looted off the corpse myself.  Wipe this sucker clean and FIX THE DAM GAME.  
---
Don't forget turrets are 100% useless against players.  
---
i mean if you can still access the military wing in the bunker, its worth a try. launching the nuke is the mission.
---
I mean flares are a waste of time anyway but it would be nice 2 have something like that ig
---
Oh awesome, thank you very much for doing that. I copied the values over to my sheet as well.
---
Scout and wood are probably only a one size thing. What I don't know is if it's considered Sturdy or Heavy just like Trapper and Marine armor is. Can't really tell since we can't craft it.
---
I feel there is more to it than that also remember that some people aren't fully honest or are clueless I argued with someone here and he didn't know how pvp worked and claimed that a player was cheating and denied multiple things to cover his ass
---
I'm playing right now? No server warning.
---
I had the mama dolce thing happen to me ate over 1000 .38 rounds. Haven't had the drop thing occur but I don't drop large amount of things. Though I could see it happening.
---
Huh, I'm making the munitions factory all fancy right now.
---
Like me too, but not comfortable enough. 
---
Mods on PC since Fallout 3 (skyrim) shows up thats possible to get better sort options in menu.
---
If we where enough Bethesda should hears us...
---
I hope so :)
---
Booblehead :)
---
Xbone, camp was destroyed by a nuke, hit repair all button on camp module, game crashes everytime
---
What perks? Which ones effect it?
---
Um... pot, kettle, black.
---
Unable to have identical weapons in a stack.  Every weapon would get its own slot in your inventory.
---
I personally don't believe in hard weight limits but hey if you are carrying more than this amount of weight, then you can't move until you lessen the load like in all previous Fallout games. Even with a special perk to let you move around at the expense of AP. That worked for a single player game.
---
Legit players need to be able to play the game. The cheating super hoarders holding unlimited crap need to not be able to. 
---
Stack limits yes. Absolutely. Bulking needs to actually be a thing though. Right now only two items benefit from bulking. The rest add weight. 
---
I find the heavy leather chest piece to be a great welcome to the game add studded on it and its more armor then most things they will find for ages and cheap to make and mod 
---
I’m on mobile sorry
---
PC VvtheDuke33 lv 116 mostly evening night, french addme! (Even if it’s for server hopping)!!
---
your reasoning doesnt make sense.. if it's hard team up and work together. how is that awful design?  you're playing a multiplayer game
---
Last Bethesda support tweet was jan 3rd... dunno what you’re talking about. 
---
Sure, it's fun to fight over them when it's not just some douche one-shoting you with his TSE weapon of choice.
---
Pacifist mode does NOT prevent damage being done to you by Other players.  All it does is prevent You from damaging other players accidentally.
---
That's cool! I'm glad there is at least a chance for cooler enemies. I just feel that they could have a made a really cool, jump scary, story event instead of random spawning enemies. 
---
&gt;Through Strength I gain ~~Power~~ Carry Weight.
---
This is how I play as well. I'm trying to find every location in the game before I finish. I am 106. Keep doing you. 
---
Of course it hasn't happened to anyone else; you made it up to beg for TSE weapons and got caught. It's embarrassing to keep this up.
---
This is more what I'm chalking it up to also, but when they are adamantly arguing their innocence/ability to do so I have to question it.
---
Supposedly you get 2 or 3 respawns and then it dies permanently.
---
I agree. The only ppl who come to contest and take my workshops are always higher level than me by a large a magnitude. Granted I am only level 25..but the only times my workshops have been attacked are by level 100s and higher. 
---
Once one 100 level plus guy kept tracking me down and killing me after taking my workshop from him. I never fought back as my weapons wouldn't even touch him and he would one-shot me everytime. I suppose I should have changed servers but was born stubborn and was thinking why I should be the one to change servers..
---
I've been playing for over five minutes.
---
How long does it take 2 tame one?
---
gave my 25 to a friend when I made my 45 still do repairs on it for him 
---
I wanna be to play as one. A regular one. 
---
It sounds really complicated, I feel like I have a solution and then there's always another work around for the exploiters... I'm all for increased load times if it fixes that issue. As it stands my internet is pretty whack but I'm never loading for more than a minute. Especially considering there aren't as many wait times or load screens as is, so an increased one on log in would hardly be noticeable. 
---
I agree with Captain. It seems like there may be more to the story than some player going around and just 1h-KOing innocent unsuspecting players. 
---
Sorry, but 7 year olds shouldn't be on live voice chat with adults.
---
This could just have easily gone horribly.
---
Duh, but if you aren't engaging in mutual pvp how can you be OHKO'd. Normally they'd have to hit you 100 times before you are even close to death.
---
If they'd simply patch out the dupe glitching and remove weapons/armors from people who have exact duplicates of the same ones, as well as anyone who has x amount of Nuka Colas etc. (I doubt anyone would get 500+ to carry around legit), that'd past fixing the actual issue be a simple way to fix the game. Both in terms of not simply fixing the actual issue, but also the player made one with completely erasing the worth of *any* item, as it is now.
---
With my 250ish hours in the game, I honestly wouldn't even mind if they simply removed the entirety of everyone's inventory - and I mean everything - even though that's a ton of time and effort wasted for a legit player. It's a small price to pay to be rid of this imbalance and broken game economy.
---
Once the duping glitches hit and spread through youtube, the servers got so unstable that I took a break for a month. Having returned yesterday and seeing everyone have the most ridiculous weaponry is just meh.
---
Yesterday I got oneshotted by a low level player at \~50-60 meters range who used a laser weapon with ridiculous spread. Likely some ridiculous dupe weapon with ridiculous legendary effects. As much as I looked forward to the day we might get ideas with PvP enabled, unless fixes occur, my excitement has been short lived when everyone and their mother - at least those who are willing to cheat - can run around oneshotting anyone without even aiming properly.
---
What if you timed it just right and jumped/jetpacked up onto the tip of the missile as the silo opened I wonder...
---
Ballistic because they do more damage, their legendaries are also less rare. On top of that laser rifles break absurdly quickly and plasma weapons don't even friggin work
---
I took a break for Destiny 2's Black Armory. 
---
It doesnt seem like its quite ready for me to comeback..
---
Don't do it man! Over-encombered is life. It's like mobile hoarders. 
---
I am on Australian PC servers, maybe it is just us.
---
seems like a bug - basically its in the leveled list for drops but seems to be effecting vendors 
---
they need to redo it though so instead of 15-35lvl its 15-999lvl 
---
I’m on PS4 so I won’t be adding you...
---
I just wanted to ask what the appeal behind KH is to you. I tried a couple different ones but could never get into it. 
---
What when you get attacked by 2 guys in xo1 with jetpacks and tse combat shotguns and when they kill you and take it they just scrap everything you built and then go to the next workshop and do the same thing.
---
It happened to me last night while doing the mama dolce event. The hopper got the torso and right arm of my x-01 power armor.
---
Luckily I had the mats on hand to remake them, but I'm going to need to be more careful in the future.
---
Now reverse pickpocket a grenade into him while he browses the cache.
---
Usually see that 3-4 times a night on pro.
---
Workshops, silos and queen fights are pointless attempting.
---
Deleted cache and rebuilt database.
---
By the golf course pro shop? Can’t believe I have never noticed this before
---
Wired All needs more love...
---
Sorry I can’t provide photo or video of it I’m on mobile
---
Just curious, 
---
How do you know that person is a he?
---
I am **really** hoping they're above selling reused assets.. but then again, I think they already have. 
---
Nice find, i had no idea about this, still discovering stuff even after 350 hrs of game time
---
That event never pops for me. I've seen lots of people talking about it.
---
That's a good idea. But..if someone triggers the mine before they claim your workshop...wouldn't you be flagged as Wanted? Do you need Pacifist turned off for the mine to work on them?
---
Reminds me of the police ad tell drug dealers to report their competitors...
---
You called someone out for asking a simple question. I called someone out for being a bit of a prick.
---
Wait that works?
---
This!
---
Enemies are random, I had a bunch of mirelurk kings. I'd prefer a bunch of glowing wendigos to be honest.

I use the Bomber Jacket becaus it's the only one that doesn't reduce Power Armor stats.

Add me if you wish! I’m usually on Friday and Saturday nights for a couple hours. Level 28 casual wastelander here!!
---
That's why we need text chat
---
Ahh okay. Like I had written earlier I don't know how the exploits work so any ideas people may have are greatly appreciated to help get me a better understanding. 
---
Shame they drop shit
---
Agreed. Stats are exactly the same....wasted the flux to find out. Each factions under armor slightly different. IMO I like the vault tech because of the luck point.
---
Not sure what you mean by force spawn. The second time I saw Grahm he got stuck on some scenery and teleported a few feet away from where he had been a few times to try to get around it. It still didn't make Chally show up. I think they both do that independently, based on what I saw when I followed Grahm for about an hour a few days ago. Grahm would teleport when only he got stuck and same for Chally.
---
Yeah I doubt it's going to be a simple fix, even my idea might be difficult to pull off it was just an idea that my friends and I came up with.
---
Yeah. Pretty decent experience though. For lower levels that is

Whitespring Golf Club can net you about 2,000 xp per run

I am on X Box and I may have some spare chameleon combat armor

I can't remember where I found mine, but I've written down every plan drop I've gotten. I'll check when I get home.
---
Yeah fair point. Fought my 1st around lvl 30 in wotago
---
fyi: 
---
you dont get 360 bullets with a proc, 
---
the proc of super duper only gives the normal amount so you get "only" 280 bullets
---
The community is why I play this game honestly. The people here are amazing.
---
The marine wetsuit, or the urban underarmour? I think they're both enclave. 
---
Server hopping is almost a must though if you want certain plans/mods. Welp, time to take my no integrity having arse back to server hop for the elusive xo1 calibrated shocks. Happy hopping hunters.
---
This is why I refuse to launch any till they fix this garbage.  Sitting on almost ten key cards and they will stay that way till it's fixed.  I constantly see the cargo bots flying near my location all the time like the game is begging me to shoot it down and take the card to launch a nuke.  I shoot it down,  take the card.  And add it to my collection. 
---
Yup. I was 30 or 31 too. I tried killing one at level 15 ish a while ago. I dont talk about that
---
You go around putting effort into scolding people for not putting in enough effort...?? How does that weak attempt at justification not sound like complete garbage to you? 
---
You're clearly the kind of person that doesn't think enough about what they say before they say it. And if we are allowed to express our options so freely as you explain - in my opinion, your pathetic attempt to shame the original poster is a CLEAR indication that you DO seek up votes (validation) Big Time! just like so many of us. I think the upvote system is key and it matters because it let's you know what others think is cool and certainly what they DON'T!!!
---
The difference between you and others is that most people seem to appreciate those that like to get attention for being very helpful and providing value to those looking for it. You are clearly the kind of person that thinks a good way to get attention is to prey on people and hope that other cowardly bullies back your hurtful views.
---
As I said, I'm glad to see others shaming you back by down voting your negativity. I hope others that might think the same way as you do see this and realise that playing the snarky / unhelpful (Lazy As Fuck) role is really not worth it and only attempted (poorly) by the very DUMB. Even If you're too up yourself to learn from this, hopefully others will.  
---
Two Shot Explosive weapobs can do upwards of 2,500 damage per shot
---
A high level requested all my 5.56 ammo, I use it for my rifles so I decided to charge 3 caps a bullet, he musta been insulted cause he closed trade and started shooting at me... 
---
Lol I took that and tripped a dude there the other night....for some reason kept putting him back inside with no escape....was terrible but hilarious. He blocked me and his whole I fought the queen....finish the fight hes trying to claim it so I went back killed him to start the cycle over again.
---
&amp; he seemed to mention her a lot less than he did every other time I saw him. When I was following him when he had Chally it seemed like most lines mentioned Chally. This time he only mentioned her twice out of the probably 30 lines he said while I was looking for Chally.
---
Lol yeah can do it ina team of 2 with ease around 15 though with kiting
---
Can you explain what you mean by that? I didn't know outfits could reduce stats. 
---
You will level faster if you punch above your weight.
---
I believe it. Cant do it solo though. 
---
I've been playing since the first day of beta but I'm only level 32. I'll like play the game 6 hours in a day and then not play for a week and a half and then only play like 90 minutes etc.
---
That would make sense at least.
---
Lol why did you get downvoted? I can't get that event to proc, but I've been watching I've heard others say this also.
---
Anything that would let all players across the map alert to the problem.
---
Not at 15 no. Well if you had a lvl 15 tse gun maybe
---
Nope. I had a hunting rifle 
---
thanks, didn't know that. I thought I was just unlucky because I expected a few thousand extra bullets more
---
Didn't know about that
---
Two Shot Explosove weapons do upwards of 2,500 damage per shot
---
Ok then :) have a nice day.
---
Also just a tip since I see your account is only a month old, but up and downvotes aren't meant to be used for whether you agree with a post or not anyways. You can google what they are actually intended for of you wish.
---
Shaming, lol, come on there Reddit police.
---
I'm not responsible for my boss' choices.
---
I love my automatic Tesla rifle.
---
Mostly b/c it also hits targets close to what I shooting at.  For example, I can shoot at a turret and it will take down the turret next to it as well.
---
I honestly, have never seen these TSE weapons. They sound crazy.  
---
I have a bloodied double barrel SG, but that does same damage as my other weapons.  My hunters heated super sledge can deal about 260 per hit...
---
I guess it'll be super fun to actually find a TSE. Looking forward to it...
---
Second!
---
Urban is better. Wetsuit has basically stats. Enclave is way better. For combat its a matter of building which is better between enclave and brotherhood. If your on xbox i set you up with one of each for my typical low asking price of free.
---
Will check again. Thought I tried. 
---
You should try this in RL during Halloween..except the killing of course. 
---
Hate thay reload speed. Give me combat or lever action any time
---
South eastern corner of the map?
---
It doesn't just crash servers, but also severely fucks creature AI.
---
It's my lucky day I am on xbox! What mats do you need? I also have the urban suit so i would just need to be modded. 
---
That’s where fissure site prime is yeah
---
Agreed... if you can't become more powerful through progression, then why the fuck waste time leveling?
---
Crazy idea here, but hear me out. Why not have optional level capped servers? Having a server specifically capped at 50 would clear up a lot of this as newbies would be able to explore main quest areas and kill the golf ferrals. While 30+ would be open to the far east regions. I'm just now hitting 39 and I've barely been able to scrape east of top of the world due to level 60+ mobs.
---
It's based on the same core tech that elder scrolls online uses.
---
Had no problem killing level 68 mutants at level 11 with a buddy.
---
It doesn't seem like there is any level scaling in place like in borderlands where the damage you receive and deal is also based on the level difference between you and your target.
---
You get the plans when you do the quest.
---
I do ask you grab an enclave one from the bunker....I'm not 100% sure if I have any extras handy still. But its the only physical suit I cant make....I think enclave events will drop it tbh. But I can mod it all the way np.
---
The mirror doesnt clip when placed on wood but not on brick walls.
---
There already are level locked areas. Savage divide just happens to be the zone bridging the lower level locked areas (forest, toxic valley, and ash heap) to the west from the high level areas to the east (mire and cranberry bog.) I imagine the savage divide was named as it was to indicate that shit's going to get real once you start trying to cross it, since it seems to be the only area that can spawn enemies at pretty much any level.
---
This. I have no idea how many caps I've given away. Just dropped 30+ plans and recipes in a bin at a train station today because my stash was full. I don't mind real player merchants, but if I wanted another job I'd go apply for one.
---
Others don't like it, but I prefer what ESO has set up. All enemies are essentially your level. I can see trying to lock some content behind a wall based on level, but high levels in an area shouldn't prevent low levels from working through an area. At lower levels you're going to struggle regardless in comparison to a higher level player, so it isn't to make content easier. It's to make it fair. To allow a level 140+player to help his level 7 bud who just got the game without his buddy having to fight level 40 enemies or accidentally 1 shotting enemies, so his buddy doesn't get exp credit. 
---
Or being the right level for being at Whitesprings for the first time truing to kill the impossible to find golfer ghouls only to encounter a dozen level 68 bloated glowing ones and a wendigo. 
---
Oh yes, my laziness. 
---
Buying Two Shot Exolosive guns. Also yes there is a 25,000 cap limit, I've reached it myself
---
Another thing u can bulk ur junk... But not all wort bulking, since they gain weight.. Other lose weight when bulking
---
No material. Just the physical suit from the enclave vendor. All others I can make up easy.
---
Well, they've had theyr innitial and christmas sales allready so it was to be expected that they'd stop caring. Nothing less from Bethesda.
---
Yes, good when you have completely 100% stable high speed internet and you're not trying to operate off of LTE and Satellite and can play just fine off LTE but not stable enough to run consistently with a friend all the time.
---
Also dependant on having friends who want to play when I'm playing
---
Yeah....I'm curious as well
---
Good to know. Thanks. 
---
On the other hand, I went into the high school and got mobbed by a number of legendary ghouls. 
---
Last night it was ghouls and a LOT of super mutants. 
---
Drop all of your junk in the train stash box, if you can. My first time in, a guy half my level killed me with one shot and took all my junk. 
---
I'm set to passive. Wasn't even interested in pvp. 
---
they shut down individual servers sometimes. 
---
How about a "lock" feature that makes items so they cannot be sold, traded, nor scrapped. 
---
Late 40's here.  My two teenage kids play 76 as well as me but we have only the one PS4 so we are all competing for time.  But when they are playing I'll sit and watch them and advise or help if they ask.  They are prone to bull their way through problems when sometimes more thought needs to go into it and that's where Dad's advice and help comes in.  They are better at combat than me though
---
I'm just happy they are playing though.  Gives us something to talk about and share which goes a long way.  Not sure my wife would agree with buying another console though ☹️
---
Anything you can share with your kids is great
---
I ran into this issue when I had a controller plugged into the PC, it defaults to that input device instead of the mouse. If you have anything like that connected try disconnecting it, should work after relaunching the game.
---
I was finally able to get the whole thing broken down and rebuilt. It looked pretty good but I jumped over to a friends game and it got stored. We got disconnected from the sever 3 times in about 4 hrs and it was stored every time. I wonder if there's something about how I'm building it that keeps it from being placed. It has a 1x1 base, stairs to a platform filled with turrets, and stairs to 1 big room that has all the crafting tables and power, walls and a roof, 1 wire leading out to 2 water purifiers. It would be a great camp for me if it wasn't such a hassle. 
---
I think it's unlikely that there was another camp in the same spot 3 times in a row, so I wonder if there is an issue with how I built it. Both the fusion generator and the PA station were hard to place correctly. Could the camp not be spawning because the sealing is too low? Maybe the water purifiers don't have enough room?
---
I really want this to work, suggestions appreciated.
---
Right now the duping glitch revolves around stacking up weapons to a certain point that it causes a disconnect and using that to duplicate stuff.   Disable weapon stacking, and that exploit goes away. 
---
Painfulkilla187 message me, jumping on in a few I'll join your server and team invite.
---
It's a feature of the game that shouldn't be there because it enables bullies and antisocial Behavior.
---
Under no circumstances should I be forced into PVP when I don't want it. That includes when I claim a workshop. All that is necessary for this to be fixed is if someone enables passive mode, their workshops cannot be claimed by somebody else either.
---
That allows the people that worship at the altar of gank to gank away without harassing me.
---
You know, I get it that dupers are assholes for intentionally crashing servers and tanking the economy, but let's be real here. If there's an exploit, it WILL be exploited, especially if its at the benefit of people doing it. This has been going on for far, far too long and it still hasn't been fixed. This should have been Bethesdas top priority and patches as soon as possible.
---
At a certain point, it's just as much their fault as the dupers. This shoukd be outside of the regular update schedule and out the moment it's fixed. 
---
How do you do fellow fire breather.
---
‘Non shall pass..’ 
---
Oh god, it worked. Was playing too much Forza Horizon 4 lately, so I had my controller pluged in permanently. Thank you really much. 
---
With you there... but son helped me get with him to around level 21 but the bugs drove him and I crazy.  Then the 2 patches came as I continued to play and now I’m in the 60’s level wise, he’s still a 21 and hasn’t touched it since.  I know he’s a size at games (as am I) but having him help me thru a number of things would probably have saved me some crazy days playing at times.  I’ve asked a few times if he wanted to play but he’s bored with it now and has gone back to the steam games.
---
My god! Did she ever land? Lol
---
From the number of times I've had it taken from me right after taking it, I agree with the OP on the inclusion of CJ.
---
Could be
---
Wow legend! Oh if you use OP weapons. Yeah I've no interest in playing 'who can get one hit on the other guy first" lol 
---
PvP is 10x better in F76 if both sides of the fight agree to stay away from two shot or explosive round weapons. That's why I ban them in all the PvP matches I arrange. Even the auto grenade launcher is very close to being too powerful, but quite a few players don't like its weight, slowness and lack of accuracy at long/ medium range, so I've not banned it yet. But the explosive shotgun and assault rifle, the two shot gauss and all the other very obvious OPs are the worst thing to happen to an online game since the hovering rocket vehicles in GTA. 
---
Yes! I don't want to have to do math when playing a video game.
---
Not if the weapon does 10k damage or more per hit. Exploits.
---
I only use it on the absolute toughest enemies. It's given a reason for me to farm mats again, though. 
---
There are ways to handle pretty much any danger, irrespective of its level, if you are resourceful. There are fights that you also need to back up from because you can't win those. Use terrerain to your advantage, and you can fight anything that doesn't shoot. 
---
Tysm!!
---
http://imgur.com/a/6WNHQp0

People talking about getting one shot or sone shotting people not engaged. 
---
Could be raw flux going inert or scrapping camp items
---
It’s ok, i still need this plan. When will you available get for trade?
---
Btw, Take care!
---
Confirmed. I still had this big bug last week when I moved my base.
---
I started the Enclave quest line by wandering into the  Abandoned Waste Dump. I'm glad I started it too because when I was doing the BoS questline you have to kill alot of legendaries and scorch beasts which is needed for promotion in the Enclave. 
---
What's ur psn? I'll add u
---
I mean, I have the plan and you still want it.. so....
---
Can't you log off and find a server with more suitable enemies?
---
Thank u!! I'm adding u asap
---
I agree with you I've gotten 3 two shot weapons and 1 explosive, but not a single two shot explosive weapon. Surprisingly none of them where from whitesprings, I have gotten them all off random legendary enemies I found in the wild.
---
My issue is either OP tunneling enemies,blood bugs, or *every single enemy with guns*
---
Nah, Enclave is Forest and Urban Operative. I think Marine Wetsuit is just its own thing. I cant craft either operative gear, but i can craft wetsuit. Im pretty sure i can upgrade the Urban with the same plans i get for Forest though.
---
its creative but im not a fan of it.
---
so the meta is to hug them, kill them with love
---
I've really noticed since the last patch that the drop rate on 3*  items feels a lot lower. Even 3* enemies drop rubbish now. 
---
I try to, most of the time I keep finding them, it's such a stark contrast after you leave the Forest
---
For me it was Atari 2600...  flipped that Pinball Game counter 7 times to zero that afternoon until we gave up.  Miss ya dad.
---
I only wear excavator 😜 best carry weight and plenty good enough Resistances for anything currently in game. Especially with the TSE meta and the ability to oneshot 99% of the monsters in the game. 
---
Oh god, please take them. I just dropped about 100 pounds of junk on the floor, including screws, adhesives, and nuclear material, in Flatwoods because I was full on space and couldn’t get anyone in my group to take them. Are you PvPing just to try and get junk? It can’t be faster than just tagging the items you need. it literally takes 0 extra time and I find I am going to scrap less often because I’m only picking up the things I tagged. I can’t use it fast enough just from the regular looting and scrapping cycle during adventuring.     
---
“I can’t figure out how the junk system works” is a poor excuse for killing other players. Just be honest and say “Killing other players and taking their stuff makes me feel like a big man and I desperately need that validation more than I need junk.”   
---
Seriously, tag stuff. Put on the “cost less to repair” perks when repairing, and forget about ever having to scrounge again. I just dumped a ton, then fully repaired my power armor and weapons after a nuke zone, and still have 250ish screws. Dude, at this point, taking the lazy way out and killing players is probably **more** time consuming and less profitable than just having your stash grow steadily while playing regularly. Tagging what you need is “set and forget” mode where I’ve literally never ran out of junk. If you’re still having issues, let me know and I can talk you through it. 
---
I’m on ps4 and I have pharma karma maxed, when ever I’m doing a quest where my goal destination intersects with a low level, I dump off a bunch of stims, rad-aways, and plans/recipes.
---
Do you care to elaborate further? 
---
Im doing well, but I play on ps4 unfortunately
---
I kept waving to show im friendly hehe
---
Paints don’t work on Excavator, Ultracite and Raider. 
---
You have it set so non friends can't join you.
---
Same thing here, I attacked a scorch beast and killed it. I fast traveled to the RobCo Research Center to hear the game physics die. I look over and it's a scorch beast ragdoll just flopping around.
---
I don’t blame you, I can probably craft some not so OP stuff. 
---
One hit with the endangerol syringer, then the TSE. 1 shots almost anything. Even better cause I have the adrenal reaction mutation.
---
Nah, im good.
---
*orbital strike*
---
Hey guys, free scrap!
---
Many times I've been one shot by guns that are like that and it's not fun.  te item wipe if the game was marked as early access and prone to being wiped etc. An odd comparison but it's the only one I can think of - Fortnite Save the World was marked like that when it first came out and I do remember having it get wiped while already investing so much time into it. I don't think I even played much more after that point but with that wipe the game did get better. But with Fallout 76 being marked as a full game not early access, I find it hard for a server wipe especially with us players with so much time invested in the game. I too am at \~200 hours and would be hurt to see everything I found and collected disappear. I don't have any "decent" legendaries myself as I don't farm for them and whatnot, but it would put a huge set back on all players moving forward. Though that's not to say it can't be a solution as it would show people they are committed to taking care of this issue and will do whatever it takes to rid it from plaguing the game.   
---
Many times I've been one shot by guns that are like that and it's not fun.  It takes the fun out of the game to see whole entire groups of people that have illegitimate guns that can one shot you while they are hip firing from across a gorge or whatnot.  
---
I'm really impressed you didn't lag out and blow up the server lol
---
" im invincible "...
---
" You're a looney " 
---
Anyone willing to buy the plan for the Handmade and  Cultist Blade for me? I am willing to help you Fast Travel and Payback with extra! (as long as you have the Hard Bargain 30%). I would love to get my hands on those plans, but I am level 38
---
It's called the damage glitch. Google it and you'll have your fill soon enough. I don't do this myself, but I have been a victim of it; it is the primary reason I support the move to separate servers for PvE and PvP.
---
You get those early on enough if you cant find someone to pass them on, just make an alt and find someone to trade through.
---
I know its not the quickest fix, but an option nontheless.
---
I didn’t even try to but a lvl 3 saw me in my XO-1 and he sat calling me his god
---
WV Lumber Co.
---
I didn't know that, thanks for telling me, I managed to get back on.
---
I drank some and I thought it gave me rads, though now I’m not so sure. The disease cure is neat tho. IRL, sulphur water was meant to heal and detoxify, but in really it just gives people the runs ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Omw
---
Yeah in it now!
---
This was great, I wish I could think of stuff like this. I sometimes go into it thinking I will try to writes something like this but then I never do
---
How would I find him?  I happen to be on Xbox and extremely interested 😂
---
I wasn't paying all that much attention, but wasn't there a recent post about how Bobblehead/Mags were stackable?  If a person duped a ton of a certain bobblehead or mag &amp; boosted a weapon to an insane amount wouldn't that eventually offset the damage reduction?
---
I've been told, and sort of noticed that water purifiers work differently on workshops than on camps.  At workshops they fill in parralel and at camps they fill in serial.  So at a workshop if you had 4 purifiers they would all fill at the same time.  Where as at a camp they would fill one at a time.
---
Yea and then she got sneaky punched to death lol
---
It seems she takes longer to land when she's getting shot because she can sometimes a "react to getting hit" animation..
---
‘You son of a silly person!’
---
Yes, it can be glitchy but teaming up and having fun with your friends makes it worth it.
---
A team mate and I tried to drop bags for low levels before.  They just don't trust you for some reason even if you announce your attention on open mic...they run away or stare at you blankly.  I now just drop unwanted stuff on corpses outside 76 if I see a new character at it or at the overseers camp if low levels are nearby
---
Yea someone did something similar just a few days ago and all of the turrents were placed on the ground and EVERYBODY become wanted trying to fight the queen and it was the worst lag fest I have ever seen to date without the server crashing lol
---
It definitely ruined the SBQ experience, but it seems like a great way to troll ppl trying to do the event.
---
Albeit your approach seems safer to not cause many if any to go wanted trying to shoot at the queen lol. 
---
Assuming the original author is happy you doing it, it’s mostly written from a storyteller’s perspective, so most of the hard work is done for you 👍
---
I found him walking through Big Bend Tunnel once. Oddly enough, no Moo Moo to be found haha
---
Googling "fallout 76 damage glitch" only yields results pertaining to the old explosive damage not working glitch.
---
Its a bit random really but most spots have been near fast Travel/Workshops.  Twice on the road between Sunshine Meadows and Hillfolk Hotdogs.  Once was past this nearer Vault Tec Agricultural.  Once at Red Rocket near Harper's Ferry just after Fast travelling, he was just off the road, coming from behind it.  At Sons of Dane heading up the road.  Whitesprungs during a Nuke and the others I can't remember.  Hope this helps.

Story of my life mate
---
I have put well over a hundred hours into it so far
---
I am running the same and had no sway last night on Xbox 
---
This is weird, because other robots seem unaffected by this. I mean even hostile robots (at least the annoying lvl 1 flying ones). It's a disease aura, to which mechanicals should be immune anyhow. I can understand if Grahm got pissy about it, being organic, but tin cans?
---
Sutton for ghouls
---
Xbox? I’ll roll with you. I think I am slightly aspergery as well so that might be an interesting combo lol
---
Well, to get inside, they'd have to bust or pick a door! 
---
So your story has already changed to "you hit them with your shotgun spray on accident". At first you tried to play the victim as if you didnt possibly know how you could get shot.. but you *knew* you had hit *someone* which triggers a *bounty*. This is 100% on you for not having pacifist enabled.  If you hit them or anything they own at all, you get a bounty. You only lose caps when you have a bounty period.
---
 If somehow this is not the case it is exclusive to you, but as you already changed your story I think its more likely not a bug or glitch, but a error of you doing something and either not admitting it or not realizing it. This is either a rather good troll (got me to take it seriously lol) or something else I  am not going to say cause I dont want to be mean.
---
I just don't get why.  I don't see the fun in it.  It seems such a boring thing to do.   I could go off on fun adventures to get this loot or sit here doing fuck all &amp; get more of something than I need.  I can beat other people but it won't be because I'm the best it will be because I have no skill at the game so cheat because I can. 
---
I've just been taking over raider camps and building into them, be nice to have the assets though. Maybe with faction PvP this kind of cosmetics might be achievable.
---
No they aren't, if they were they would be able to without exploiting. You could say the very same about duping. You're meant to be able to duplicate items, it's called a work-around. /doublecheckmatedropmic
---
In the Ash Heap, the dark area in the south, you’ll see a drawing of a theme park in the Western area. That location has a vendor that sells Excavator mods and plans. Do note that Excavator plans lack the prefix.
---
For example, instead of T-60 Medic Pump you’ll see Medic Pump.
---
The trade function displaying your entire inventory to the other player was horrible design to begin with.  There should be a toggle to display all items, but the default should be to only display what you put up for trade.  Additionally, if there is a "display all", then the OP is right in that there should be a "not for sale" mark.  Any item that is favorite'd should automatically be marked this way.  (There should also just be a way to lock item from sale/scrapping in general, not just from players... I'm getting so sick of my inventory jumping while vending and then having to buy back one of my primary weapons...)
---
Wait, so what is the 'bad' thing that happened to you when dropping loot too fast?  You went off on a tangent that didn't seem to say exactly what the bad part of your bug is.  
---
Ahh yeah, I figured that would happen with people fighting the creatures she spawned if I put it on the ground.
---
My idea was a donut/bowl shape so that if she flies directly over it, she gets hit by as many as possible and the hole in the middle allows the turrets to shoot things on the ground without getting in players way
---
Just take a power plant or red rocket and drop an extractor. 
---
I recently got the flare guns plans. If a lower level sees me in the waste feel free to hit me up. I will make you one and some ammo. I think as a community we need to put those to use for calling for help or in general pointing out something interesting.
---
Just go take a workshop like red rocket an put an extractor. Sounds like you only need a bit though if you're building a scope. I have 200 in my stash rn.

Hey!!!  I just thought of the Wingsuit!  That would be a great apparel item addition to the game...
---
I've had 3 of my characters on a few junk piles have yet to see another person's camp on them yet. Though the one location is really close to vault 76 so it's not ideal for a free fast travel. 
---
Yes. I don’t think anyone has confirmed it from the game code but I have anecdotal evidence. My first char was a sniper so I always took just the munitions factory. My second char was melee and never took the factory, but took junkyards and farms instead. They both had tons of duplicate recipes, but not the same recipes. Then I started taking workshop I’d never taken with any character, and got new blueprints neither had. It may be my area (forest/mire, etc) but there is a definite difference. In my experience, there is some generic recipe overlap (metal box), but each seems to have their own unique set too. 
---
Excavator mods break down into Black Titanium, so that's another way to identify them.
---
Songle Action is hot garbage. But the .44 and Western are both pretty powerful, the western being a direct upgrade.
---
They are better for VATs builds, as all pistols are. However, they could do with a slight damage buff to balsnce the fact you can't throw a silencer on them.
---
George town near vault 76
---
Im sure. Unless you attacked a wanted person and they killed you, you do not lose caps if you are not wanted, are in pacifist mode, and dont shoot a wanted person. If you are claiming otherwise show proof with a video, or you are just making up things like the trade scam debacle. 
---
kill mole miners and scrap their suit junk. In ash heap by welch station is a bunch. or blackwater mine
---
Mole Miners drop scrappables that have it along with deathclaws dropping it. There's a workshop you can grab and farm for it with an extractor too ✊🏽
---
I put all sorts of plans and recipes in cash registers next to all the vendor bots. My weight management is someone else's gain...
---
Yeah, on this note: has anyone ever had a mass enemy spawn occur on them? I feel like I can be sitting in a ghost town after killing a few Scorched then, without warning, be assailed by a phalanx of 20 coming out of the wood work. Typically, they'll all rush in a line at me so are easy to deal with, but yikes!
---
Already doing that plus black face paint. It works well enough when the face is mostly obstructed, but just looks creepy as hell when it's not.
---
My buddy had his two-shot exploding shot gun turn into a normal shotgun, I've only counted my blessings that it hasn't happened to me.  So I've heard of it, but it seems exceedingly rare to be the point of questionable, but I trust my friend as he knows what he had in his inventory. 
---
Gorge junkyard workshop and mole miners
---
Kill mole miners. The scrap they carry gives it.
---
Don't waste your time on ore as you can kill enough miners before you'll get 10 scrap from 30 ore.
---
So far for me, as a two handed melee build, the sledgehammer with a specific combination of mods can be better than the Super Sledge. For some reason I have the ability to make mods that are something like "bladed puncturing rocket" for the sledgehammer, but only "heated" for the super sledge. The crazier sledgehammer mods do more damage, or at least did a few levels ago.
---
It also seems like faster melee weapons (eg swords) can take out some enemies a little bit faster, so something like a ski sword with sharp/bladed/whatever mods on it can be really good. 
---
I'm not sure what the numbers in damage represent, if it's DPS or if it's "max amount of damage per hit without using power attacks or criticals", but if it's the latter then theoretically a faster weapon might outperform the super sledge.
---
Same, but I'm even worse, level 29.  Just hard to get the time, or am competing for time on the PS4 with the kids.  But that's fine,. I have a grand time when I play.
---
Cool thanks everyone :) feel free to add vaultgirl92
---
People have claimed it's bugged and doesn't increase damage at all. Dunno how true it is, but I honestly didn't notice any difference myself. I would pump 4-5 shots into a meaty target in VATS, and the chunks of health it took off looked very consistent.
---
Also, you really can't use VATS with heavy guns, the AP cost is beyond insane. Like half a bar in one shot, and each shot does a small portion of damage of a rifle or even pistol shot. 
---
I keep seeing this here and I am curious how you got the enclave next to your name
---
Top left of the map, there's a place called deathclaw island, a deathclaw spawns there at level 21, not hard to kill, he drops alot of it, server hop everytime you kill him and you should have enough in 20-30 mins
---
what goodies are there? or just for lulz
---
Yeah they would fit the theme much better! 
---
Hahaha you're a certified one trick pony. You're incapable of explaining anything yourself lol 
---
How are you not embarrassed at entering yet another overly lazy "google it" suggestion in this conversation. 
---
Yep, that's the sad thing mate. I'm brand new to this platform and even I understand its better to help people asking for it than to try and benefit from shaming them so coldly. You're one of the experienced ones - you should be trying to encourage less seasoned users to GAIN from reddit, but what you're doing is more likely to scare new people away from using it. 
---
You are free to do what you want. Everyone else is free to shame you for being a pest when you act like one. 
---
Read it again my dude, second paragraph. Other people understood.
---
Apparently Bethesda didn't make online tools for themselves to detect these kind of things.
---
I'm just waiting for the day they release patch notes that say they found a way to detect people who dupe/cheat and Ban them all for life.
---
As it stands right now though I don't think Beth really has any intention of fixing this problem. They haven't even said a word about it.
---
I think Bethesda would sooner hack their bollocks of than “ ban their credit cards” 
---
Grahm hits almost all workshops. 
---
Never a dull moment. (Playing since beta)
---
Am I the only one who just can't complete that quest due to that fucking scorched beast and the fact that it stays forever since the robots of watoga are no match for him
---
At level 50 you can out dps a stimpak easily. Even with level 3 first aid I can two hit with a super sledge. 
---
That sounds like a great problem to have 
---
since you can hit level 50 enemies once, let the high levels kill it, and swim in experience
---
I do this as well.  I found a surveyor's benchmark in game too .. Easter egg maybe
---
If someone attempts to take mine I just let them. I dont care for the pvp so I just let it be and go about my day.  It I also think it has happened o ly once or twice since beta 
---
Sometimes when the loading screen between rooms is initiated while in a team, my teammates will spawn invisible, but I can still see them killing stuff and taking stuff off the walls. Maybe you had some people around on the server that just weren't visibly loaded up.
---
You can kill the molemen at blackwater mine too. They drop nuclear waste
---
I’ve done it like 3 times on my lvl 120+
---
I didn't know this and was wondering where that "medic pump" mod should go! Thank you sm
---
Red rocket it is. Tnx!
---
Go back through the door you came in and follow the hallway. The path is quite linear.
---
I'm a 44yo Mom and I'LL play with you if you need a buddy! 👌 I've had a CPL weeks off, but I was at LVL 30 or so last. 
---
It’s 10 lbs in a frame, but yeah you can always recraft it at the place you made it if 10lbs means that much to ya
---
Actually I have seen something similar. A lvl 20 chasing around a lvl3 and killing him then using the cannibal perk on his corpse and he did not become wanted. He did this multiple times until I stepped in. If a lvl 3 isn't supposed to be able to pvp then how can a lvl 20 pull this off not once but 3 times to a lvl 3 and not become wanted? 
---
Hope someone with modular powers can sticky this. Appreciate the time and effort compiling all the info...
---
sooo... could couldn't very nice and just stay there and not lunch, let's say for 2 hours and 15 min's ?, that when i will be online, pretty please, lol :D
---
It really comes down to whoever leaves the server first, whether it’s out of annoyance or out of a lack of time. That fact of the system is pretty shit, but what can you do?
---
No I have bloody mess for myself
---
I really wanted to lvl up "normally" with my alt but quickly gave up because of this. So i started to server hop to find whitesprings nukes, tagging all ennemies to get free xp. Went from 24 to 50 in around 6 hours.
---
If I recall right, the more pieces you have you more steps you can take before it de-cloaks you, I have one piece and it lets me walk about 2 steps before shutting off, as for the actual stealth effect I don't think it does anything, I'm able to literally crotch in front of a mob 2 feet in front of me and they won't see me
---
It's also insanely broken in PVP because players can't target you in VATs
---
They all die simultaneously.  It's super obvious.
---
Huh.. interesting.  I haven't paid much attention to what plans they give. 
---
I've just noticed that some workshops can be super annoying to hold on to.  
---
Thanks.  I'll keep an eye out for it. 
---
How do you tag?
---
I will mention that the minigun I have is TSE and even when she was on the ground it took a full 500 rounds to get probably 1/60 of her health. 
---
You did not put a trigger warning, THAT Is bullying.  You are victim blaming, THAT is bullying. You are using foul language which is abuse which is basically a death threat. I am going to write about this on my Tumblr and tell everyone in the safe space at my college to avoid you and all of your posts and also going to report you to the CIA because at this point you are basically a terrorist threat to everyone in this nation for this horrible and abusive post. How dare you.. just.. how dare you! IT IS CURRENT YEAR AND WORDS ARE VIOLENCE AND SO IS TYPING!
---
Never hurts to see how others are farming, that’s more violet than I’m making currently depending on how long / how many nuke zones it’s taking you.
---
well yeah those 3 are starting areas. i believe you can get lvl 40 glowing mole miners in the ash pit (which is the max level they can spawn). with most multiplayer games the beginning area is level locked to help out new players. if they level lock other areas it ruins the game. once you venture out of the starting area it should get harder. like if youre level 20 it shouldnt be easy to get to the watoga vendors in the cranberry bog. that is and should be a high level area. this is fallout game so you can go anywhere at anytime, but in this kind of multiplayer game, you arent intended to be in certain ares until you reach a certain level. level locking would suck. once you hit 50 is the cranberry bog the only place that spawns high level enemies? that would get so boring. you would essentially lock endgame players into 2 regions (mire and bog). i feel anything outside the 3 regions you mentioned should be able to spawn max level enemies like it does now. as it stands now, it makes a good reason to team up with others and make friends. the wasteland should be dangerous. i get people want to play solo for whatever reason, but teaming up with randoms has been a lot of fun. 
---
The wanted part could be because the game can't register him as wanted because it can't register that the person who was killed can pvp? Not sure how he killed him though.
---
I think removing the ability to drop items would make a lot of people angry including myself.
---
I don't drop items for other people I drop items because my stash is full and my inventory is overweight.
---
If somebody followed me around for one game session they would have enough to max sell to each unique vendor faction a couple times over.
---
They just need to create Dev tools to detect duper's and cheaters. I'm waiting patiently for patch notes to say that they can now detect and the ban Hammer will drop.
---
That's what I mean. You go through the laser grid that is now open and it leads to a long, sweeping left hand corridor. The only place you can really go is a room to the left labelled "storage". In this room, there is a locked door that needs a terminal to unlock. I can't find the terminal.
---
Game design, support, communication and planning, all scream singleplayer game to me. They are probably working on new content right now to make it into the news again...
---
Yeah that's exactly what happened to me too. Thankfully with the event it wasn't particularly a big deal, just frustrating since it made me heavily over encumbered. Pissed I lost my two shot and grognaks axe last night though god damn.
---
Hmm wonder if it's those really edge case 10,000+ damage builds you hear about with specific armor + perks + TSE weapons. 
---
I'll ask the dumb quetion:
---
Did you - propably by accident - disable the controller option in the settings?
---
I don't trade at all. I would love to sometimes, but I tried it once, didn't understand how it works, and with all the talk about exploits I just don't trust it. (Yes, I heard this trading exploit isn't actually real, but I alos heard the trading exploit not being real isn't real either)
---
The one time I tried it I could not figure out how to make it happen. How do I see what gets offered or what gets requested? It was in the very beginning of the game and the other player hasn't had a clue either. But after that wasted half hour trying to get trade working I just gave up. So I have still shitty weapons because nothing decent drops.
---
[Technical data is misspelled](https://imgur.com/GmfEjLd). 
---
When doing the Hidden Knowledge mission for the BoS, technical data is misspelled as shown in the picture. A minor issue, but it still irks me that something like that got through QA.
---
I’ve read T-60 is the cheapest to upkeep
---
finish the mayor for a day mission in watoga (when above level 50) and get the "all rise"
---
all rise = 90% reduced weight super sledge
---
handmade with a reflex or scope = perfect for short range (hip-fire/vats) mid and long range
---
i wouldn't carry more than this so you can free up some weight for meds and replacing your carry weight perks for damage/survival perks
---
Same I got a two star one and it has two shot and if I am it it gets plus 10 damage and with the pistol perk cards it does like 176 that with the first three cards can’t wait to get all nine of them 
---
I don't have that answer, but I have a solution. Use power patcher and the 200% repair perks. It takes a long time to break.
---
They should make it literally impossible to trade... yeah sounds like a good idea...
---
If you look at the trade channels, different dupers are all selling the same gun. Someone buys it, dupes it and starts selling it to dupers. It’s hard to imagine each different duper got the same +25 defense while aiming on their TSE combat shotgun, yet multiple people are selling the same one on eBay:  https://i.imgur.com/EG0MPvW.jpg 
---
If you're lower level the nuka cola factory has plenty of it lying around.
---
Gift ,donate ? I SMELL A DIRTY COMMUNIST 
---
Sure but they are not created equally and in some cases only that location will do.
---
Welcome.
---
But then a weapon dealing 2500 damage should be dealing 1/4 of the targets health bar outside of mutual pvp at least yeah? Not the usual tiny sliver.
---
Of course you should be able to drop items, but other people would not see what you dropped(or could not pick those up).
---
Definitely want marsupial, you can jump way higher and you get +20 carry weight
---
I love this post.  My wife is a newish gamer.  She's not great, but I love watching her get better.  She gets so excited sometimes, it reminds me of how I felt playing Halo for the first time.
---
When I found my wife was a tabletop gamer and open to video games (among other reasons), I ringed that quick!  Today we have 2 new gamer girls downloading, estimated completion time is April 30 - May 2.
---
Good on you for putting those ghoulies to the curb, girl.  Find you a BF or whatever floats your boat that can appreciate your gaming hobby, cause let me tell ya, most girls will just put down gamer dudes instead of trying to enjoy the hobby themselves.
---
Oh nice! Thanks
---
Yeah I never understood why PA in the PA station would go back into inventory.
---
When I moved my camp it go duplicated, so I'm guessing you tried to move your camp around 20 times?  Or at least a few to the point it might be duping the dupes as well. 
---
Did not know this was a thing.. Now i can donate stuff for the greater good
---
Wow, just wow.
---
same, i usually drop it in the cash register :)
---
On the end of that corridor there is an opening on the left hand side. 
---
The door you've mentioned is a short way out. It can only be opened from the other side.
---
Marsupial is my fav so far. Super jumps makes it easy to do things a bit beyond my level, run in, get objective, jump away! 
---
Yeah, its unlikely as fuck 😂😂
---
No idea I don’t dupe so who knows. 
---
T60. Just takes plastic aluminum and steel.
---
I had it placed on the golf course so its often i log on and its already taken
---
False. Have you ever engaged in PvP? Try it, and then come again telling me I'm wrong.
---
Invite me and I'll help there's no rooms that you can only go through with a terminal gt: lawfulgabe312
---
Add me up jamesp1989 :-)
---
got mine there. One of my favorite outfits.
---
That was fucking awe-awe-awe-awe-awe-awe-awe-awe...𝘋𝘪𝘴𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘚𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦𝘳
---
I'm pretty sure that group blames Bethesda for some stupid reason: I played all the content, I don't like x, I don't like y, I don't understand how the engine works...
---
Honestly, It's not hard to clear a poi and then go over 800lbs, I start having all sorts of stablility issues until I can get to a work bench and scrap all th items weighing me down and the 45 ammo I dont use 
---
If you’re over level 30 blackwater mine is THE best spot. About every other mole miner has a scrap on them so just clear it out , also has a PA workbench and decontam shower. I got my exc set in a few hours doing that.
---
1. What platform are you playing on?
---
&gt;PC
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable)
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
During the Line in the Sand event the Sonic Generator is not able to be repaired and therefore the quest can not start.
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable)
---
I didn’t know this! I might want to make a low level one punch man! 
---
When I found my bloodied explosive combat shotty that is the first thing I did. never regretted it. All the shotgunner cards scattershot and demo expert are a must. Oh and adrenaline too.
---
Add me :p psn is same as here 
---
This! I too am a pistol build. What kills me is how rarely they drop as legendaries. Also, not putting in good .45 revivers for the pipe pistol, a good .50 for the pipe bolt, and a good .308 for the revolver is just cruel. It just neuters them. Pipe guns were so versatile and upgradable in FO4. On top of that how often do you see high level legendary pipe guns? The only one I've seen I bought of a vendor.
---
Also add the Bull Barrel from Fallout 4, it's not even in the files :(
---
There's also a place you can move your base to for an extractor as well
---
Ah gotcha. That makes more sense.
---
But then there's the issue of your bag dropping at  death. If no one can see your bag at the point of death there's no fear of dying anymore.
---
That's really my only fear of dying in this game is losing junk.
---
Will do my man
---
I don't have the animation, but mine repairs. Wtf.
---
&gt;What about all the issues discovered during the B.E.T.A.?
---
When you look at the structure and timing of that "beta", it was never about exposing and fixing bugs. A marketing tool that's it.
---
Also ghouls in a nuke zone almost always have nuclear waste on them
---
Oh nice!! The raider armor is plain awful when it comes to repair right now
---
Trading is broken because of the glitch, and sometimes broken things get removed until there is a fix.
---
O cool I hadn't considered the regular sledgehammer, just assumed the super sledge was better. Apparently there's a "Heavy Searing Sharp Rocket" mod which is considered best? I'll have to start picking these up
---
For your gun? 
---
That's DEF the best route if you wanna be shitting Black titanium 😂🤙🏾
---
Right, laying around means being sold at a vendor. Okay buddy.
---
I fact there is one door in the storage but it can only be opened from the other side. First room on the left side after the laser grid.
---
The inventory screen, especially weapons one I’ve noticed, loves to re-organize itself when dropping stuff so that’s my guess what caused it
---
Lots of supernatants I believe
---
Yeah makes sense to punish everyone... or they could just add a report button...
---
Run into a blast zone with radiation protection and just Loot all the dead bodies others are killing.
---
10k steel scrap = 1k weight also not exactly easy to farm 10k steel so yeah ban that as well
---
If you are going to run Class Freak 3 then I'd suggest just running all the mutations, the benefits of all far outweigh the negatives... nevermind the savings of cost/hassle of acquiring the 'right' ones. 
---
I think t45 is in the same boat if you're lower level too.
---
t51b is pricey like x01
---
I got it at 39
---
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
Damn, I've not noticed that before! You're probably right to be honest 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
You need to be online for 48 mins. It’s ridiculous 
---
Tried to add you, but it wasn't pulling anything up. 
---
Nuke the DMV.
---
I’ve ran it about 7 times trying for those plans and got everything but...
---
Dude, you do you. I hope it helps you get that validation you’re craving, but don’t pretend you’re good. You just complained about how even relying on cheap tactics, you still can’t figure out how to play the game at the minimum skill level required not to go on Reddit and beg for scraps. Everyone just saw that. Everyone is looking at you right now. Oh my god. Now they’re all laughing. I’m so sorry. 
---
A lot of people have talked about raising the weapons levels. I’m not sure how this would work. In the current system all players are basically equal past level 50
---
Just different load outs. If the weapons cap is bumped to 100 that’s a lot of levels added before the “balance” takes effect. 
---
Note: I’m using balance for lack of a better word. We all know it’s not. 
---
Just reset their inventories and levels and let them keep the game. So when their friends say hey let’s play fallout 76 they can’t say I don’t own it, no now they have to say why they don’t want to play it because they cheated.
---
sick ty!
---
Hmmm...true and it will get too complicated if this deathbag works differently from normal lootbag. There is a chance that things will just get more broken.
---
I think I am most likely doing the same, but id love to check out your video to see if you thought of something I havent. Always open to new ideas for sure!
---
I nuked Harpers Ferry last night just for shits and giggles.
---
Lots of high-level super mutants. Got a few legendaries but nothing of note.
---
There is a little bit of Flora around that town too.
---
Wow that’s crazy. Guess I’ll just sit next to the vendor then. 
---
The vendor is bugged. He’s trying to only give items purely suited for your level rather than including other items. This behavior isn’t intended.
---
I like your style. I don't think a to-the-point video like that would be ill received :).
---
You can't be revived by Diluted Stimpaks.
---
Soups give some food meter back.
---
Get some fertilizer and corn/mutfruit/tatos.  Then you can make soups none stop
---
Yeah. The pack brahmin I inadvertently damaged belonged to the Responder Vendor Bot which is why the bot and his two eye-bot security bots started attacking me.
---
was hoping that the queen would drop a jetpack or stealthboy plan for the Ultracite PA, but so fare i have only seen here drop plans for the limbs, torso, head and the explosive vent, but somone also got calibrated shock plans for it...
---
since there is now a developer room that someone has broken into, i was hoping we could at least get it confirm if  they exist, dev room in Fallout 4 had every single thing you could get in the game :)
---
There should be no tolerance on this crap.  These people not only makes the servers unstable, they diminish the experience for everyone else.
---
The worst part is all people on the same train line share caps, all whitesprings vendors share caps etc. So we all have so much crap and nowhere to get rid of it
---
Just beware gifting it. If the other player has not done the quest and registers the set they can never get the set. That said if someone completed it at lower levels and just needs to upgrade their set you would save them a shit ton of black titanium and springs 
---
I was wondering if welch and mount blair train station would be good since there are lots of mobs
---
otherwise, there is a location between Grafton and hemlock homes? I've heard people mention before is pretty good
---
It’s 24 hours 
---
Are there any missable trophies?
---
When a chameleon camps out a workshop with his explosive shotgun with the intention to kill anyone that takes the unoccupied workshop, then doesn't take it, just continues to greif anyone and everyone, then gets a bounty and gives it to his freind then repeats the process, taking 2k of your caps when you're in pacifist and have made no effort to kill him because all you want to do is repair your weapons and cook some food, it's not just part of the game.  
---
It's the most effective method of greifing discovered in the game, it's a viable method of earning caps at the expense of others, and it makes owning a workshop a death wish.  
---
Want to have any caps whatsoever?  Want to claim any workshop to complete some challenges/quests?  You better not unless you're prepared to deal with zero-life losers that get their rocks off by ruining your otherwise pleasant gameplay.  
---
They literally fast travel to any workshop and do this.  
---
It's designed for people to be able to take the workshops.  they aren't there to take the workshops, they are only there to kill you for free because they found an exploit.
---
Lot of reviews on yt are from beta , it is a good game with a bad rap and a few issues. 
---
So why can’t you just pick that stuff right back up?  I’m not seeing the problem here.
---
Oh yeah I noticed this we while ago but it hasn't served to happen for a while
---
Cheaters punish everyone at the moment. Let's take the power away from them.
---
I don't trust that report button would have any real effect.
---
Its 22-24 hours
---
Hmm what's your gt
---
That is the real mystery is how he was a able to kill him to begin with. I can understand if the game enemies did it but not another player and only using a melee weapon. I forgot to mention that.
---
"Fix it good" for the 200% repair buff? Yes it works with PA and for normal armor.
---
"Power patcher" makes it cheaper to repair PA and last longer.
---
Just the "Armorer" perk allows you to add high ranking mods and adds durability when crafting normal armor.
---
"White Knight" makes normal armor last longer and cost way less to repair.
---
Probably a dlc like the mothman stuff and all the vaults
---
Here have some explosive diarrhea.
---
Oh I agree it would be dumb to make more areas low level. I was just pointing out the people complaining that some areas spawn higher level stuff have a whole ton of places they can go without that happening, even if a high level player shows up. The OP is just complaining because he wants to do a specific questline that takes him to an area that has higher level stuff instead of leveling up more before trying to solo high level areas.
---
So, wait... you were dropping notes and holotapes into the hopper during this event now?
---
21 hours. The timer begins once you've sold something to one. Each faction vendor has their own timers, all 21 hours. 7 factions total. 
---
marsupial jump high +20 carry weight downside -4 int
---
electric charge get hit emit a shockblast around you for some damagedownside take some
---
plague walker you deal disease damage small for disease you have. downside you have to have a disease for it to proc...but you get diseases like crazy so yeah..  
---
if you play in a group i highly recomend getting strange in numbers only 1 point in perception 
---
and it doubles positive effects of mutations while in a group. so marisupial able to jump on top of 2 story buildings with ease +40 carry weight
---
If you are on PC and your IGN is the same as your name here, i just sent you a friend request.
---
You do need one black titanium scrap to create a bleed out syringe
---
Once player traders are allowed, I want to open a blacksmith shop near Vault 76 (free travel) and give every newbie a free full set of level 5 leather studded deep pocketed armor.
---
Keep them alive longer.
---
I don't really know myself to be honest, I just remember the look of the  place

Theres a dev room for 76?? 
---
And yea, id like at least a confirmation. I dont usually buy mods at all, id much prefer plans and craft myself, but if i know i have to buy them.. Then i guess i just will haha
---
We need a Firebreathers paint for the Excavator. They found it, just didn't get to it until the Dwellers joined up

---
I really want to role play as a hippie. Walking around and hugging randoms while I say "make love, not war".
---
Socially awkward gamers... I think this is the target audience.
---
At least there are four different vendors. Now that I know the timing I’m going to make sure I hit them all once an hour. 
---
It just doesn’t maintain any secondary sorting criteria.  So if you have ten items of the same weight and you are sorting by weight, their listed order will reshuffle.
---
I’ve never seen this with regular alphabetical sorting in inventory.
---
You have to do enough damage so it registers. I usually use a shotgun, spread helps. 
---
That run in front of strat only worked since they were not pvp geared.
---
I mostly agree but it feels preatty shity  if someone takes the Workshop after you defendet it against a scorchbeast and the one who took it is a Level 100 something and one shoots kills  you every time you try to retake it untill you give up becouse you have zero caps i would have no Problem with pvp if it would be some where near balanced (I Do not blame the other Player i only blame the unbalanced pvp System)
---
So, wait... different sections of the inventory can rearrange themselves so severely that weapons show up in "notes" and "holo" sections now?
---
I know your pain. Had the munitions factory yesterday. Defended it twice, rebuilt everything. Went for a trip into a nuke zone at white springs while checking it every couple minutes to make sure no one was coming. Levelled up and as soon as I selected a perk.... crash. 
---
Logged back in hoping to be on the same server and get my sweet 5.56ammo. Nope. Nothing. NOTHING!!!
---
So pissed. Happens way too often but it hurts most when you’ve spent time and resources building up a workshop. 
---
r/fo76bazzar
---
I always revive everyone in the nuke zone. You’re doing gods work lol
---
Normally the servers are just laggy when this happens, switching it should fix it. If you wait long enough the crafting menu does pop up though. 
---
I love my excavator. With two shocks on it, its a carrying beast. 
---
My bad, dude. I forgot to mention that the game crashed and instantly closed when I went to pick them back up, which is why I lost them :( unlike the mama dolce's where I had no option to retrieve them regardless 
---
You can visibly tell when wearing them, at least with combat and leather. 
---
I've only really modded out my Excavator.
---
Targetting HUD - Enemies glow red. Doesn't work all the time for some reason. Some glow, some don't.
---
Motion-Assist Servos - +2 strength and Emergency Protocol faster run speed and defense when under 20% health (I have two torsos I switch around).
---
Optimized Bracers - Less AP use from Power Attacks.
---
Calibrated Shocks - +100 Carry Weight
---
Why did you censor the name? Let this POS be known to public.
---
You don't need a build to use it.
---
Just 5 pts in demo expert if anything.
---
Exit the game and then relaunch...  Seriously, I've had weird things happen lately on servers.  I couldn't get out of my Power Armour last night (PS4) until I did this. 
---
Sounds like... a ballsy plan but sounds like it would work
---
Please add a link :)
---
Happens frequently in areas that has a lot of models still loading like Whitespring or your Camp. You just have to wait 
---
That's a trip yo
---
Ok?  The text is descriptive and accurate, what is your question?
---
A lot of high level mods need black titanium to craft them.
---
From a fellow Scout Armor fan, great write up! I was aware my Urban left arm was shittier than the right; I did not know the Forest variety doesn't suffer from this.
---
I was an idiot and fully modded my lvl 40 set before it dawned on me that I'd be able to get a lvl 50 set. And damn, you're right about the mods. Took me about a week to get full Polymer, with arms and chest Ultra-Light, legs muffled. I see you mention at some point that the head could be modded...are you talking about the Mask? I've never been able to apply mods to it before.
---
I really hope they introduce Legendary Scout, or let us disassemble other Legendaries and apply their modifiers. I'm stubborn in my love of Scout Armor, so I'm waiting it out!
---
Same as my username on here. I figured it out. I'm just blind, apparently. Lol
---
you dont need that much, but im pretty sure you do need it to fix X-01 as well. iv been on a two week break from 76 but im pretty sure
---
I’m sure there is a third party app that can assist in the appropriate filter. 
---
Sounds like my dad and I. We’ve been playing games together since Atari 2600. He’s 80, I am 39. Keep it up!
---
With those kind of quantities, the players are easily found. Bethesda could watch the activity of accounts with this quantity. For a couple of weeks.  Discover the entire ring of players doing it.  If on XBOX or PS4, issue ToS bans across the the entire trading network. 
---
Additionally, if these “players” are causing traffic problems across the XBOX live network for instance, there’s precedent to get their entire account banned.  
---
Ah yeah I didn't learn about All Rise's popularity post-50 until I'd already gotten it at a lower lvl :( but from what I'm seeing a modded supersledge can do better dmg.
---
So maybe 2 handmades, one with a reflex scope and one with like a medium scope? (I use medium on my "sniper" - never found a need for much longer range)
---
Would I want different receivers for each or is there a "meta" (hate that word) of mods that everyone uses, besides preferred scope?
---
I’ve been dumping my duplicates since I started the game... feel like an idiot now haha. But at least now I’m holding onto every copy. :)
---
\*IMO the dupe was only worth it when you could glitch the stash box to store items despite it being maxed out weight wise.  Carrying all that crap around on your character is too impractical. 
---
I suppose if ppl use a mule account to just weight down with everything that then I guess I can see the point, but having to transfer between that is also a lot of work and to me still to impractical.  
---
But I guess if there's a will there's a way kind of thing :-/
---
Fair enough, that and enforcer for getting rid of scorchbeasts
---
Whatever I can find.  Seems the vendors only sell the same shit and Im getting mildly irritated that there is no reliable way to acquire the "good" ones.  But as it stands there isnt any endgame to speak of other than looking for plans.  Its sad, really.
---
yeah, there is, was a post about it here yesterday, but no real details :)
---
But if you have seen a picture of several players in a owl's head and PA, that is where the owl's head came from :)
---
I have an Auto Grenade Launcher, thats the name, no prefix. BUT, it increases damage for every consecutive shot on the same target. Only weapon ive acquired with an effect and no name.
---
I can’t roll my eyes hard enough at you.
---
I see, I always associated the wet suit with enclave since it was military. 
---
How do I gain access to the silos?
---
This is great!  This kid "heard" about what happens in the wastes.  There is now a culture based on fear and survival out there.  Now, when crossing paths with anyone, the reactions from low levels will be authentic and every engagement will be organic. 
---
That may be why Bethesda won't stop the griefers and black market dupers.  Or they don't know how to. Whatever. Cool story, OP!
---
I have a problem with ammo. I keep running out. And can't find enough. Idk how people are able to farm over 1k of each type so effortlessly. 
---
Messaged you. 
---
Not sure if he is online now, but it seems like he shows up nearly daily.
---
Apart from the mining bonus if that's your bag
---
what specific container?
---
I think scorchbeasts machinegunning your ass from space will be more of a turn off. I know I just log back out if a scorch beady attacks me and I can’t get away
---
I have Asperger’s syndrome and I play on ps4
---
"Cries in PS4" 
---
It worked because they were stupid. They all had power armour that they put on so they were ready for a fight with a low level.
---
Found the raider
---
ahh very true. But only for workshop benches indoors..like the Munitions factory?
---
Well I'm doing it for bullying (sorry)
---
Okay, try "stacking bobbleheads and magazines in Fallout 76" for one hundred, Alex.
---
I’ve always randomly come across him. He’s helped me defend a workshop before too. I run into him pretty frequently. 
---
Your spoiler tag is useless if you put the spoiler in the thread title...
---
Nonono, never get the 9 star on any kind of weapons perk. Get 1 star on the 3 perks for a good +30%, then 3 perks in blody mess for +15% (for all kind of damage) and 5 in explosive (intel) for a 100% if you have a explosive legendaray.
---
I have 3 perk cards with 1 star on rifles, heavy and pistols, so I can change my weapon on different situations.
---
I don't. I also don't care. If it's a she they can correct me. It doesn't matter. 
---
I drop bombs in the mire because you can farm tons of flux. Another cool place was the corn farm but i forget what its called. 
---
Yo my brother, aspergers also. Jsprx on ps4
---
r/woooosh
---
Tell that to the solo player getting walked on by a party of three.
---
Hmm something isn't right here, I don't think they even make 1GB 1060 Cards, isn't it 6GB by default?
---
What's the FPS looking like during this? If your FPS is a solid 60+ it could just be corrupted game files and running the repair tool on the Bethesda Launcher might fix it
---
But if the game is struggling and chugging at sub 30 FPS at just the character screen than there's a good possibility something is wrong with your GPU.
---
it wasnt actually today it started working again kid
---
Go slow next time.
---
I've noticed it many times. When you mash the button it starts to lag and takes time for things to drop.
---
If yuh don't notice you keep mashing and it drops extra items 
---
Lol there isn’t a reason? That is the single best place to grind xp and farm legendaries. 
---
Shouldn’t have gone on shady websites overnight then, kid.
---
Yea, they were plain stupid to use power armor for pvp.  If they were using the best pvp legendary armor they would not have killed themselves. 
---
No controller option appears in the settings. Only K &amp; M. It happened in game so I don't think so.
---
Ugh.  If only I had the same experience as others with the flare gun.  Mine looks like it disappears if I don't aim at the proper angle.  Once it's in the air, it seems to vanish in and out of my sky.  I don't even know if people see them since no one has ever responded.  I assumed the flare served another purpose like distracting enemies for me to stealth on by.  Nope.
---
Yeah, it is a great location. I’m on Xbox. I haven’t decided where I’m moving yet, but somewhere different. I’m honestly just excited to venture out and find somewhere new.
---
I nuked Morgantown once, wasn't too bad for nuked flora. I'm sure there are better places, though.
---
Deathclaws drop BT ... 3-8 each
---
Server hop the substation just north of Watoga. Guaranteed DC spawn point. 
---
It helps to use a gun that will 1-2 shot most basic enemies. Also helps to have friends who are willing to drop their excess for you.
---
I don't really have issue with ammo because I save a ton of stuff, craft a shitload of .44, and I don't waste it on low level or basic enemies and instead use a 10mm for that.
---
With Focus Fire I regularly was one shotting most basic stuff with a single headshot anyway.
---
Marsupial 100% im a level 25 and it kept me alive in a nuke zone because i could jump over things to outrun enemies plus the carry weight bonus is just amazing.
---
Question though. Is there anyway I can get Marsupial and keep it easily? 
---
That's too bad, but thanks for the info
---
Plus, mirelurk kings frigging suck. They spam that sonic attack so much. 
---
We'll start leaving me your 2.22 mm 5.46 and 45 I'll always look At your bag.
---
[I see you down there!!!](https://i.gyazo.com/4558cb4f34751540e249cffca61ea960.jpg)
---
There is a reason...to farm the area for legendaries and exp. 
---
Well, if it helps, I’m proud of you.
---
In the time you spent making this post, you could’ve server hopped and gone into the enclave.
---
It's alright haha the silos can definitely turn you around
---
I’m usually giving out my duplicate plans to anyone I see. Hoping that they don’t have at least some of them.
---
ive been looking all over Helvetia for these also
---
rip, well keep fighting the good fight out there.
---
I had a wndigo spawn when I explored those Caverns. It fit the story quite well except for the fact it was just standing there in the path instead of crawling around on the walls and ceilings.
---
Whitesprings is nuked for a VERY good reason, your friends just don't know it.
---
It's the best place in game to nuke for experience, lengendaries and certain nuked flora.
---
Nuked whitesprings glowing ones are each good for like 350-850 XP EACH for me @ L222.  That already blows any other way of events/xp grinding you can find outside of that WAY out of the water. 
---
If you do the 'loop' (don't just stay focused at the golf club) in whitesprings with a buddy, just relog in once it dries up and everything respawns and just repeat ad-naseum for as many levels or legendary farming as you want.
---
Event after the blast zone wears off the glowing ones still spawn for like 30 mins - 1 hour after that part.  
---
Ideally you want a nuked whitsprings that has nobody or very few ppl in it aside from you and a friend, that way so there is less XP kill stealing. 
---
Wow people are actually using workshops instead of duping the resources? At least on xbox, I barely see a single place captured anymore.
---
None of my alts can complete the "kill unruly golfers" quest in Whitesprings. Those guys are level 15, and now there's nothing but level 58 ghouls in that area, all day long. It was an easy quest before everyone leveled up. Now the higher enemy spawn tables are all we see.
---
It seems like a glitch, but I've noticed it on any under-armor that is 1wg or higher. 
---
I'll give the stat changes. 
---
* Excavator Armor (naked): 320, 276, 386
---
* Excavator Armor (Bomber Jacket): 320, 276, 386
---
* Excavator Armor (Knight Suit): 262, 218, 326
---
* Excavator Armor (Officer Suit): 262, 218, 326
---
I think ppl are full of shit and don't know pvp mechanics.
---
For instance if someone takes your workshop and you decide not to take it back you're still flagged for pvp with that person.
---
You can go to their base and level it to the ground with no wanted.
---
 But my autism means that you shouldn’t be allowed to upset me.
---
I mean this one -&gt; [https://imgur.com/emRw2LD](https://imgur.com/emRw2LD)
---
Happened to me as well once, that's why i'm asking
---
I'll be honest, I originally thought the mechanics were PVP is enabled within the workshop but it functions as it always does when not in the workshop.
---
Now that I know, I'm a bit more careful when I choose to take workshops.
---
I do not care for it allowing the person who took the workshop to just hunt you down, even if you never contest it. I'd at least like a "release" function, so I can just let them have it and remove the PVP tag immediately. Because they can just have it, if I don't go back and try to contest in the moment. There's a reason I didn't, and whatever that reason is at the time trumps my desire to bother with taking it back. I can go try to claim it again myself if I really feel like it, later.
---
Good Doggy ftw!
---
I have, and have tested it, and you are wrong. Unless you shoot someone or their stuff, you will not lose caps if you are not flagged/wanted and someone somehow manages to kill you (which is next to impossible as if you are not flagged you take 1-2% damage max). This is how it is supposed to work, and this is how it does work. 
---
OP tried to originally claim the same thing you are, if you read my comments and his responses he then retracts it and admits he hit a few people on accident without pacifist on. I dont know why you people want to make up stuff, and then act like people have to prove its not true. YOU are claiming the game is NOT working as intended, your WORD alone means nothing, it is on YOU to show SOME SORT OF PROOF or supporting evidence.
---
Seriously dont get why you kids make up stuff so often.
---
You know, this is how bugs get found and fixed. The people exploiting them tend not to explain how it’s done so that it stays around longer. 
---
Wait, back the fuck up, there’s an instamash factory?????
---
or pop'ed a rad-x and just walked in :)
---
Starched genes...?
---
I’m level 78 and the one for level 50 never popped for me, rather disappointing..

Plays a game about nuclear fallout.
---
Angry at radiation and mutated creatures.
---
Hazmat suit is pretty easy to come by.
---
Maybe rethink this rant.
---
Can you not get into the bunker when it's nuked?
---
Thanks the  iPresentInterval change HELPED SOO MUCH I was getting 12fps on low settings, until I turned that off now I'm getting stable 144+ I needed that so badly.
---
for reference my cpu isn't shit GPU:Vega 64, CPU:Threadripper 1950X, Ram: 32GB. and the system doesn't get and thermal throttling in any other applications even burn tests.. so gotta give that one to poor optimization of Bethesda.
---
To be fair most higher leveled enemies aren't really that hard to kill. I never really had an issue
---
1. press m, then z, then quit to menu, then 'play'.
---
that will remove you from the 'nuked' whitesprings and put you in a new server. 
---
Has for why people nuke whitesprings.. well it has the best spawnrate for ghouls, so more xp and more chances at legendaries.
---
no reason? nuke whitespring has golf resort that spawns at least 15 or so ghouls and at least 2 legendaires.. then there are at least 3 other spots that spawn 5-9 ghouls and at least 2 lefendaries. and shit keep respawning. nuke fissure sites nothing except scorch beast. nuke prime only get 30 min of shit spawing in then its just running around picking up violet flux 
---
The story. Almost every game I play is for the story.
---
Besides the very obvious reason why people nuke whitesprings. It shouldn’t even be that hard to reach the door and get into the loading screen.
---
And then shooting the ground near the bag which is hard to see. Haha
---
Keep it, or you will regret dropping it later.
---
The overseers cache in the responders church. I load that puppy up regularly.

That's where it gets difficult for me. I play alone. But thanks for the tip!

i feel for you. we went through dementia and alzheimers with my great grandparents. my most recent loss was due to cancer and i didnt handle the final months well. it will haunt me forever but i had a great life with her in it and that cant outweigh a few months.

i wish the photos had gps tags, all i remember was i was escorting a low level friend while he did quests and found it on a porch of a house on the outskirts of a small town. maybe summersville/grafton/clarksburg

God I thought that was just me that never could find a server without stupid high golfers
---
Hey, noob here (i don't hope to be that noob of course, but until i get things done better i'll consider i am one).  
---
Got a question here for experimented people.
---
I've got a few explosive weapons (no TSE god tier at this moment sadly, but i'm trying to get one), and i've got an hard time figuring out why doesn't it hurt that much scorchbeast queen. My best explosive weapon is a instigating combat shotgun, and from what i've seen it works for me to hit the ground under scorchbeasts in order to hurt them, but it doesn't seem like it is relevent when fighting the scorchbeast queen. I've got +100% explosive damage from INT perk, and the PER perk that make rifles ignore 36% of target's armor. When doing SBQ i equip the perk that reduce pellets spreading and increase precision (and range i think, or not?), but it still doesn't feel like i am really usefull at all. Any tips or informations i can make a good use of in order to be more efficient?
---
That’s what happens when game developers don’t care about you, just your money.
---
I'll check.  Funny. Support didn't even ask me to check that. I suppose a bug could have changed it accidentally. Thanks
---
Everything but empath and herd mentality if you’re solo. Skip the melee ones if you don’t melee.
---
 If you group, only take empath if they do too, and you should invest charisma in strange in numbers.
---
Unfortunately most likely true 
---
I'll usually plink her with enough damage to register for the kill then run off and just focus on the ground enemies to help keep them off the ppl wasting all that ammo whether TSE or not on her as they shoot her in the sky.  
---
Then grab my share once she's downed and be off before the PvP killing starts to take all the rare junk she drops for everybody that everybody seems to do. 
---
Wow that's a real bummer, got all my other level trophy's perfect just the level 100, pffff I hope they patch this shit then
---
if you sit at a table in the restaurant area of the whitesprings, the waiter will come over and wait on you.
---
he sells a big menu of food items.
---
Does the workshop inventory refill? How do you proceed to build after using all theyve had to offer?
---
I dont build at workshops, just curious.
---
Yeah, it got us there, thank you again!
---
Yeah see it would be coll if they had a build up to it. 
---
However much some weighs on a mule is irreverent, it's going to be in the many thousands regardless. 10k Steel is not hard to come by, I dump thousands onto my mule daily.
---
At least you can be honest that you do want legit people banned too, so thanks for that I guess. :/
---
Hi
---
Ignore those guys, play for you think is fun. You will find people that support you.
---
Do they have an achievement/trophy for finding all of the locations?  I feel like they did in previous games.
---
Is this confirmed? Everytime I check that, it just contains boiled water. Unlike the one in watoga.
---
Sometimes pops up 5 minutes later when you've given up and walked away from the table. 
---
FWIW, I was able to buy the handmade plans in Harpers at level 10.
---
As it is right beneath the pacifist mode setting it happens to me about one in ten times that i change the wrong one :-)
---
As a son of a 54 years old gamer and the father of a 5 year old gamer in training this resonates on another level. 
---
Yes but only 100 locations. 
---
I was floating around Flatwoods seeing if I could help some newbies when I spotted a lvl 15 talking to some folk who had just stumbled out of the vault. All had mics, and the lvl 15 was explaining how things worked in the game (albeit somewhat poorly).
---
I approached, wearing one of the civil war outfits I had procured from the museum after a fight with a yao guai and seven supermutants (lvl 30 at the time, I believe).
---
Lvl 15: "oh, and don't be like this guy." (Gestures to me) "he probably spent like $10 for that outfit. Don't spend money on outfits like this dude did, that's stupid." He then wished them luck and headed to the agricultural center.
---
I plugged in my mic and followed him. When he turned around, I spoke up: "hey, dude. If you want this outfit I can show you where it is."
---
Lvl 15: "oh cool, that'd be awesome."
---
So I showed him on the map where he could find it, he thanked me profusely and fast traveled to that location.
---
Even if someone is acting like an ass to you, just kill them with kindness. 😊
---
Judging from what I read from someone who datamined the files, the devs forgot to put a flag on the vendor who sells those plans. That's it. Just an oversight that they were too lazy to fix yet (like it's a flag on a vendor, that shouldn't be hard to enable in a patch).
---
I can barely claim one workshop and defend it before the inevitable disconnect let alone four. 
---
Saw Graham in Big Bend Tunnel. No Chally :/
---
Only dupers complain about this shit.
---
I haven’t played much but how does one tame a deathclaw 
---
If they do the right and necessary thing, which would be to restart everyone back at zero, so many people would piss and moan though.
---
It is not the players fault, that the game is so poorly optimized and implemented. That some players use glitches to pursue a better outcome is to be expected and has to be accounted for by the developer. 
---

AP regen from Action Boy/Girl perk and Lone Wanderer perk *do* work while in power armor. (There was a recent post which claimed AP regen from those perks don't work while in power armor, but a commenter later provided results from actual testing, which showed those perks working correctly; my own quick tests also showed those perks working correctly.)
---
A Core Assembly torso mod might be better for your build, since it provides passive AP regen, instead of requiring you to get hit as for Kinetic Dynamo. Kinetic Dynamo seems better-suited for use with Dodgey perk instead of VATS.
---
What system are you on and have you noticed this more at any particular workshop?
---
I found an explosive shotgun. It also has the Junky prefix. I don't use much chems because I don't like the addiction downsides but I already had a few points in shotguns and demo. I think it's pretty good. Can't remember what kind of shotgun it is exactly now but I think explosive anything is pretty strong.
---
What’s wrong with your hazmat suit?
---
Get outta here, Rose!
---
This happens to me often.  Isn't that just a bit of latency?  Sometimes if I wait a second, I can save that last bullet because enemies will have that last tick of health return but then fall over dead.
---
No. Obviously. As the name goes, It's a dev-only room (similar to the dev room from FO4). Of course you're not able to get there without cheats.
---
I'll check later thanks for your help.

---
I .. had to look that up, lol. But no, just some on the spot stuff.
---
It's a survival game with goddamn PvP. He doesn't need justification or validation to attack other players. You don't need to tell people that they feel like "big men" for engaging in an aspect of the game. If Bethesda didn't want players attacking players, they would have made it completely PvE. 
---
Hell i still don’t even know how to farm it so please go ahead 
---
I know where it is if you haven't found it over the last month...lol
---
I mean I've seen on here other players who do it. But maybe not that many? 
---
I use sentry because the assualtron opening :/ But thanks for letting me know it closes with a weapon drawn! Didnt know that.

The assualt gas mask has a very good robot look to it tho, and that doesnt open at all haha
---
I'm somebody who doesn't have pounds and pounds of free time on my hands. When I game, I like to do what I wanna do, when I wanna do it. So if I happen to have an hour to spare one day, and wanna spend it building my camp, I wanna do that. An hour of BASE BUILDING. Not 40 minutes of grinding and then 20 minutes of base building and then running out of resources again. That isn't my idea of a fun pastime. So for somebody like me, duping makes a hell of a lot of sense. Now... I'm not saying that I'd dupe so many items to lag out the game, I'd just probably give myself some extra resources to speed up my camp building. I'd spend these cheated in resources on purely cosmetic base building and nothing else (ie. Workbenches, turrets, etc would be crafted legitimately to balance things out I guess). Is that wrong of me? I personally don't think so. I'm just finding my own enjoyment in the game. I probably spent a good 800 hours in fallout 4 base building (I don't know exactly how long, because my actual time spent in game is closer to 1,200 hours. I spent the last few years of my teenage freedom in the Commonwealth).

In other words, should my creative abilities and expression be limited by the amount of stuff I can fit in my backpack? I personally don't think so. I think that in an online game, cheating *is* wrong, but only if it seriously gives you the upper hand or negatively impacts other players. I wouldn't do either. I'd just like to build my camp's walls and furniture without running out of resources every 5 minutes. Afterwards, I'd probably delete them because I have no interest in cheating in any other way. After my camp is built, if I have to go scavenge a spring for my hunting rifle or something, spectacular. I'm up for it. It's just grinding for base building that I personally hate. Does anybody else share this point of view? Or is it just me? 
---
1. Plans can be dropped anywhere around the world and are pretty common in events
---
It's a common glitch, and possibly broken for everyone. I hate having it in my Quest list even though it's technically completed.
---
This sounds closest to what I've experienced so far. It seems like it doesn't have a set daily reset, since it will take a while to reset after I sell anything, but it also seems to be a bit less than 24 hours
---
The corpse on the stairs by the vault.
---
Their atom shop.
---
Anyone auth it is cheating or lying.
---
Alright and what SPECIAL is that under?
---
(Said in a TV voice) “Confessions of a Hoarder”, check your local listings.
---
Could be, though it happens on EVERY mob type so I honestly could not tell you for sure. I just know it's stupid. If its mitigated then it should not be healing it should just lower the value of my dps. 
---
Though in all honesty it could just be a server to client issue, I just hope it gets rectified.
---
yall have any luck? only one ive found so far is the Faschnacht in the asylum
---
Betting on it being vending machines we build in our camp.
---
Yea I don’t get how this is going to be reasonable with duping still around.  I don’t want to buy duped stuff so I feel like I can’t buy anything from anyone but people I know.
---
How about a quick google on the subject before posting this bullshit.
---
just run through harper's ferry or other high density super mutant locations (they have lots of super sledges you can scrap to learn the mods)
---
the benefit of all rise is the weight reduction otherwise ski sword would be best option if weight is a concern (fully modded super sledge weighs around 40lbs)
---
obviously its because people are duping and ruining the economy. lol. no but really i know what your going threw, except max lvl excavator armor and even a couple weapons
---
Atom cats in atom shop? Really? I think not
---
This is the ONLY reason why I bother hunting for TSE guns. Every other enemy can be handled with skills and tactics. Scorchedbeast is wait-and-see-until-it-whenever-lands. 
---
Screen shot, photoshop. 
---
Lol, we are just arms. Arms and a pip boy. XD
---
It didn't launch my friend.
---
If a raider understands that this isn't a fair tactic and you don't, then that says something.
---
Major L
---
Usually I see him near Morgantown
---
Did it with a friend, can confirm it works. Your friend just has to jump at the right moment 
---
I'm a month late.. what did you use to make this map? Do you have any links to tutorials? I'm looking to do something similar for another game and am not finding anything anywhere near as good as this.
---
I'd agree, but I wasn't even on the section for weapons, I was emptying holotapes and notes and it decided to drop armour and weapons despite this 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Unfortunately all “stash boxes” are linked. There have been increases from 400lbs to 600lbs but idk if the plan on separating them into categories in the future.  
---
Also a good deal of the people who are level 200-300 probably exploited the disarm bug
---
But if I didn't care about weight do you know what melee gives the most DPS?
---
Let’s make SWTOR meta again
---
Nuke zones. I'm level 71 now and I'd say probably the last 30 levels has been pretty much exclusively from nuke zones, I get 2-3 levels each run. If one ever drops on your server, jump in your power armor (or hazmat if you nasty) and head over to where everyone else is clumped around, usually the golf clubhouse. If you're undergeared, just grab a pistol to tag everything you see and enjoy the ~450xp per kill, but make sure you stay with the pack cuz shit hits hard there. 
---
I wanted to mess around in my newly made armor after spending an entire day doing some math homework but Fallout has other plans
---
She's highly resistant to explosive dmg, and it varies each spawn it seems on how resistant.  Also, I do not believe combat shotguns benefit from rifle perks.  I use a TSE lever rifle on the SBQ, with my perks and mutations, it's listed at around 1100 dmg +/- depending upon my health.  Even then some times fighting her it feels like I'm doing nothing, then others I see I'm dropping 1-2% of her health per shot.
---
I agree with account reset as duping punishment. They could even make it lore friendly by saying Atom granted them Division! lol
---
&gt;Forest Operative Underarmor
---
There are no mods for the mask. I was talking about Forest Operative Underarmor. That goes in the vault 76 jumpsuit slot. It can be modded with operative linings plans sold at the same production terminal. There are 4 plans. You need to buy the treated version. Then the resistant version. Then protected version. And finally you can buy the shielded version that is the best
---
You're the one asking and everyone is telling you the same thing.
---
Ask the person who had it how they got it.
---
There is tonnes of items in game but not available.
---
Im saying that i would like to know what they are while looking in the item list. I can figure it out when putting them on. Id like to know so i can wear full light, full heavy, or full sturdy, and not have to mix them around to find them.
---
Well my post obviously admits it's underhanded so idk what you're talking about. All I was saying is a real raider takes his meal ticket however he gets it. Downvote me if you want, but you misunderstood what I said. 
---
I’ve heard they are there but I can’t find them at all
---
There's really no end to it, all their buddy has to do is get out of the team, claim their bounty and then buy a bobby pin from them for 1700 caps.  
---
Some of my friends that get bounties do exactly that to keep their caps.  
---
They can always roll as not a friend on the underlying system and do the same to keep the money in the circle of friends.  
---
It's stupid but it's a forever loopholed thing.  I really like the idea of all the caps bounty going to the person 'wronged' to maybe put a curb to it being a net-net win for griefers as that would imply they wreck their friends base to get a bounty to just have that friend with the wrecked base get all the caps reward which doesn't make sense.  In a sense I'd have to pay the player I wreck the base of for wrecking their base when someone kills me to claim the bounty.  You can't reward the person that claimed the bounty as that will still turn into a grief mechanic, it's gotta be a net loss to do it to make it work. 
---
I would like to know the details.
---
My first character is lvl 95, second at 45, and now I’m looking for an interesting new build for a third. Never done pistol build, VATS build, or critical build before.
---
I was much in the same boat when I first considered buying fo76. Had heard tons of bad reviews on players and the game itself. Honestly I bought it anyways assuming it would exceed my own expectations of a fo game. I figured I could grind my way through anything for a taste of the Fallout realm I hadn't encountered yet. A mere 5 levels into the game I came across a loot stash left by another player in the overseers camp. At first I thought someone was trying to store items there to return for them, until I saw the loot itself. Several rations of food, water, ammo, a couple of decent guns and plans. I was shocked. It helped me get through the beginning so much I couldn't help but start up a stash to hand out to lower level players. Because I was helped out so much early on, I like to stock up level one weapons with decent mods and hand them out with supplies right as people walk out of vault 76. I'm so happy fo76 has turned out to have such a good community. 
---
Ahhhhh yes, i did see that. 
---
Should i find that post to get myself up to speed on the topic?
---
Oh, I guess I'm lying then! 
---
Thing is, someone took a workshop I had, and then killed me. Who lost caps? Me. 
---
I'm sorry if I can't be bothered enough to show proof to an Internet nobody, though *shrug*
---
Try not to choke on your salt, man.
---
I’m leveling with a pump shotty. It’s slow but I just got enforcer and almost laughed myself to death after crippling a deathclaw. Scorchbeasts though, just no. 
---
I'm the same mate, I enjoy it but I can only be arsed playing once a week. I start din beta and only level 21. I enjoy exploring. 
---
Need to bottle that shit! :)
---
For the crime in mention, yes it does. Court, lawyers ect
---
Ah, yes. Same happens in player camps, if they have a brahmin pen. Then all their turrets open up on you.
---
It's a nice mutation, helps to tag enemies and take care of trash (those little bugs Mirelurk Queen spawns), but it can be annoying. I've been thinking about getting rid of it. Even with 3 diseases the damage is nothing to write home about.
---
Sure you do make... empty words. Fact is, successful people don't behave that way and don't dwell in corners an bashing other people for whatever success they are having. Only poor, miserable and hateful people do that. A typical online troll. 
---
Try again.
---
Marsupial due to the increased jump height and carry capacity.  The downside with class freak is a measly -1 INT.  Well worth it.
---
Speed Demon gives you +20% move and reload speed.  A fine trade to have hunger and thirst advance marginally faster.
---
Bird Bones buffs agility and slows falling speed.  Combine with marsupial and a jetpack gives you ridiculous mobility and the penalty is a tiny -1 STR.
---
Carnivore/Herbivore are great for efficiency as long as you don't mind going for a specific type of food.  I find carnivore to be more useful since meat drops from things i kill anyway.
---
Grounded is amazing.  +100 energy resistance in exchange for a debuff to weapons that nobody uses anyway.
---
Healing factor is great.  I never have to use a stimpak outside of combat and i dont bother with chems anyway.
---
&gt;At the VERY least, there should be a community manager hanging out on reddit and saying something. Like "yes(or no), those who are using the X item are exploiting", or "hey guys, our biggest priority is X right now and we really appreciate the feedback and reports"
---
I tried to bring that up on here and it didn't work out at all..
---
What's even more surprising to me is that there isn't a close relationship between the fallout community and at least one community manager after all these years.
---
The game and community I'm mainly part of has one that even posts during holidays and spare time because it's more than just a job where you vomit PR bricks onto social platforms handed down to you by your superior.
---
Fo76 is my first AAA game for years and it feels like gaming in the 90s. Sink or swim.
---
I feel ya. Makes sense. I think Marine stuff is like basic military gear, whereas Forest/Urban is faction specific military gear. If that makes sense ha
---
I'm a PA user if it makes a difference. 
---
Hello?
---
this is a good point, i still have mine but its lvl 35 so im seriously considering breaking it down to make room and to upgrade it later
---
Luck, requires level 30.
---
“Favorite” items should make the item vanish from the trade inventory.  
---
Yes, stuff in your stash and in your inv get auto scrapped when the components are needed. I recommend you scrap everything before stashing though to save space/weight
---
They can still hunt you down across the map and come kill you with no penalty. Even after taking it and being the new owner you're both tagged for PVP against one another. 
---
Was a nasty surprise to have a dude appear and blow me away because a series of group-member disconnects left me unknowingly the owner of several workshops, one of which he decided to claim. 
---
I'd just dropped off a boatload of junk though so fuck that guy, didn't get shit from my lootbag.
---
Crappy. My performance has been butter this week.
---
But i run my ps4 with no nat from a cheap router so that might be a difference maker.
---
Carrying tonnes of items can make things fishy too.
---
And constant server hopping at whitesprings gets pearshaped eventually.
---
Oh a full stash will do it too
---
super sledge, deathclaw gauntlet or ski sword haven't tried using them non-legendary and non-built for it but I'd say deathclaw gauntlet would have the highest base dps (can't use in PA though) so if you care about that super sledge
---
Stacked Sentinel/Assassin armor effects + natural DR from the armor and whatever perks he has would reduce your damage to nothing.
---
I would say yes, though there is no saving the last bullet. They tick heal each shot, mind you this is far from all the time but I do run into it often enough.
---
So if I do 5 dps per shot, they heal 2 dps per shot. While they still die it takes a lot more rounds to down them than it should.
---
I just sit there in stealth sometimes when it I see it ... debating whether or not I'm just going to walk away, lol.
---
Oh wow I didn’t knew that 
---
They are available in game, they are craft able at an armor workbench. The hot rod armor paint schemes require you to find Hot Rodder magazines to get them.
---
The event uranium fever, watoga high school, and sugar Grove are the best alternatives in my opinion
---
same here. also there are a few that I should have got during the Beta, like leaving the vault that I still haven't had pop
---
I suspect the range might go to +/-5 levels beyond immediate 5 so possibly 10-24 or something like that.
---
Ahh, I see what you're saying. Got Shielded :).
---
The part I was referring to was:
---
&gt;The mods don't stack in inventory because they are for head, arms and legs.
---
But you've answered my question already. Thanks!
---
Because SB's are literally the game's WORST enemy.  Give very little XP, drop absolute worthless turds, and wreck your armor for all that effort.  A sentry bot is a much better enemy as they at least give a fusion core, or hell even a run of the mill goul can drop you some shotgull shells, or anything else remotely useful.  
---
SB's, you get a little bit of food that weighs like 20 pounds for 10% food lol. 
---
Gets those toxins out one way or the other. 
---
On my PS4??
---
Thanks for the enlightening response. This is a discussion about Photomode on Fallout 76, not photo editing software on a PC. Close though.
---
Totally agree! I feel like there is a prevailing attitude among some players that everyone would get along in a post apocalyptic scenario. Sorry to say, that wouldn't be the case. People would fight over resources and participate in general anarchy. After all, only when you lose everything can you be truly free. So, while this game is beautiful and immersive don't expect it to be all rainbows and butterflies. There will be pvp. There will be blood.
---
Arm up and good luck. Be safe!
---
\+1 for Nuked Flora. Best location by far
---
It can't be dropped or traded.
---
I’ve tried to launch a nuke twice today and the entire server crashes every time I get to the section chiefs. 
---
You can’t hold me down Todd Howard!
---
Post it 
---
He had multiple TSE weapons? I just want an explosive heavy or Shotgun 
---
Yeah, that's called "civil court," and it isn't where criminals go.
---
That's what I was gonna say. Along with empath and strange in numbers (if he had a posse)
---
no point, the guy  didn't want to disclose any future details i think, you might try to pm him :)
---
I am not interested in going into that room, but would be so nice to know, lol
---
You really want Bethesda to fail. They are already great at banning and alienating their customers. They do not need further motivation...
---
Also, I inadvertently killied a bunny once because of it :'-(
---
random
---
uranium fever event
---
watoga
---
monster mash event
---
Yeah honestly... I don't want players to see EVERYTHING that I'm carrying. That just seems like an awkward UI choice.
---
The quest is to find a duper that is bored of the game and selling them for cheap.
---
you still have it? im offering 3k caps
---
On this topic, didn't like the 2nd big patch do this for outfits? My outfit items used to stack but ever since a certain patch any duplicates now take up their own slots I've noticed.
---
I think instead of enemies leveling to the highest player in an area, it should be reversed to spawn based on the lowest level player. 
---
Seriously. The only actual faction is the Enclave
---
I don’t believe this is possible. 
---
You cannot have assassins and sentinel on the same piece.
---
So lets go with sentinel because it is the bigger modifier:
---
-15% x 5 = -75% damage, plus DR for the last 25% damage:
---
His non- PA DR is nowhere near a set of X01, so therefore I would *at least* be able to do 25% of his health with a single shot. I got about 5% damage down on his bar. 
---
The math just cannot work out logically.
---
Yep, the wanted player lured OP into an trap.
---
I'd be willing to buy one if I could find someone selling on PS4 
---
I found the plan for motion assist servos at lewisburg, and my go to place is either bos vendor bot Phoenix, in the bog downtown, or harpers ferry. I found calibrated shocks once, lol, there.
---
I’d like to know how as well, encountered this a couple times. I was farming a whitesprings nuke with a melee player that did not have passive mode on. I did not have passive on either at the time. He hit me twice on accident while swiping at ghouls and killed me in my x-01. I thought damage was minimized until I engaged him in return. I guess that’s not the case? Maybe he had a bunch of melee bobble heads stacked and could kill passive players regardless. 
---
Working as intended based on his armor and perks. 
---
Two shot gatling gun, explosive .50 cal and LMG
---
Think you need them for one for the serums, grounded mutation maybe?
---
nope
---
Or the mission isn't done as the last tape indicates she's alive
---
He finished reloading
---
It's a given you get downvoted because people don't believe you, but you are actually 100% correct. I can confirm you can use counters like you describe. I've dont nothing but claiming workshops and bounty hunting from lvl 20 to lvl 95. In my lvl 40's I started to get more wins against lvl +100's, before that it was hard. After I acquired Chameleon armor I started to win all my fights against people with two shot explosive shotguns, even though I only had non-legendary weapons. When they claim the workshop theyre an easy target for nuka grenades in the claim area. They also like all lemmings believe they are invincible cause of their TSE weapon, so often they don't apply any sensible tactic but run to the target and shoot, making them easy puppies to ambush.
---
I'm not saying weapons shouldn't be balanced, cause that should be a continuous effort of developpers, but TSE users are far from invincible and the chances you meet them are grossly overstated. I myself encountered only about 5 of them over the course of more than 100 fights over workshops. 
---
&gt;They all just want your money.
---
Some want to make a good game AND be profitable. That's something very different.
---
I love it, it has style!
---
I'm still in the mobile-utilitarian-CAMP phase.
---
I did this too, but with a jetpack and in 10 minutes.

---
Omg this is what should've been in the base game! So much love to the person who made this mod. why after level 50 should I be prompted to open card pack and "level up" If I only want to change a few cards to lockpick or something...
---
A 4\* prime explosive shotgun with 80% damage (total) to scorched
---
I lost my dad at the end of 2016. He was 55 years old and I was still at university. Cherish this amazing bond you have and keep gaming until you can't game no more. All love to you and here's to many more future nukes. 
---
P.S. I have a reproach infestation that needs dealing with if you're free 😉
---
I’d suggest dropping every holotape and note that you don’t need. My own game started improving when I did that myself. 
---
It works great if in vats. Obviously cant use a stim if locked on to someone.
---
I made a post about this the other day. It an exploit.
---
Here is link to post

---
Different plans are dropped different ways.
---
Camp (mostly decor) plans are earned by taking over and defending workshops. Some are purchased and the best vendor for decor is inside the Whitesprings resort. Structural camp plans are most often purchased at Watoga train station, Watoga Market Plaza, or Harpers Ferry.
---
Weapon plans can be earned or purchased. Lower level plans can be purchased in the Forrest/Toxic Vally regions, Mid level weapons in Savage Divide/Ash Heap vendors, and high level plans in the Cranberry Bog/Mire regions. ***Handmade plans can be purchased in Harpers Ferry from level 35-45***
---
There are numerous events that give you plans for weapons and their mods.. the best event for this is “Patrol Duty”
---
I am aware, and apparently he did others with his 1k bounty.
---
I just want to know how I did such a small amount, not that hurt that I got killed
---
Stop following the pack and experiment. 
---
Add me man. Name is same as here 
---
Then you can have the sneak perk to triple that damage to 7500 per shot.  I'm wondering if there is a point where the game just says anything passed this just allow full damage, that would make sense for having ppl get 1-shot while in passive. 
---
Anyone looking for ultracite scraps? I’m selling some. (Ps4) 
---
That's strange. You shouldn't really be dying too quickly. But i should say there are a bunch of perks that don't work in Power Armor. Serendipity is one of them as far as I'm aware.
---
I saw that on an episode of modern Marvel's once it was a failed weapon because the rifle didn't have enough range to put the crew outside the fallout radius
---
I was about to say, only excavator 
---
I just bounce if people are trying to pvp me at a workshop. I don't play this game for the pvp nor should I be forced into while doing something that is for MY enjoyment.
---
Bullies, no. Absolutely not. Anyone using that term is being silly.
---
Fruitless and ruining others enjoyment, again. Absolutely. There are a limited few who are willing to defend something, use their supplies and hold it down. For me, thats just not something I wanna do in this game. It's simply not designed for it.
---
As such I just spend a lot more of my time around my base, building, making it look nice, fortifying it against the creatures that loom in the dark. But other players? nah, pvp in this game can go eat a huge, smelly turd for that is what it is equal too.
---
I was thinking it will continue with DLC
---
Yes, I'm well aware of the differences. Violating a contract doesn't make you a criminal. You haven't broken any law.
---
I didn't think about it that way, which adds some more mystery for new content. However, the official guide only has those listed.
---
Lacking TSE weapons myself - I use a Gatling gun and switch to All Rise when she lands.  Gatling is better at ammo but still uses a lot.  Not a big issue since I can mine iron and lead easily enough for replacement ammo.
---
Yes there is. Some armor piercing weapons are better than some TSE. Also explosive with the scorched dmg perks are better.
---
Yep! I like this platform a lot so far because I enjoy writing. At least YOU can't accuse me or others like me ("that write novels") of being "LAZY" lol.
---
"helps you reflects and be better.."???? That's a very sharp 180 turn back on your stance a few lines back!  Do you ignore votes completely like you said before?  Or do you actually think it's important to pay attention to what other people think like you're trying to say now?? 
---
I'm not sure it's worth debating with you much further. You seem quite confused and willing to blurt anything out just for the sake of having something to say back. You can't seem to stick to a firm position or any focused line of thought. 
---
The last thing you said I actually agree with but it contradicts your initial reply and your first reactions to me telling you off - it's been my point from the beginning.  YOU should reflect on YOUR first reply to the OP and consider apologizing for being a bit rude, not helpful at all or intelligent in any way (worthless).   
---
See, this is why people need to not believe what they hear about the fanbase and actually play for themselves. I have my CAMP set up with a stash box, crafting tables, and some water purifiers plus a bed that are free for anyone to use. It's right near the Overseer's camp so I can get new players to come by, but sometimes they won't follow me cause they think I'm gonna kill them
---
Do your CAMP act on the leveled enemies ? My CAMP is on the junk pile, next to the train station of the Top of the World. I never stay long in it, but I'll move it if it's dangerous for low level players. (I like this spot, it's cheaper for the fast travel everywhere)
---
I don't think so. I loaded into the photomode folder (My Documents / My Games / FO76 / Photos) but I think the game looks for a specific filename format.
---
Oh well, still a bad-ass screenshot!
---
Cool thanks I'll try that
---
At what point did I come across as salty? I just think its dumb when people make stuff up and then back it up with "muh word". Also kind of funny that someone calling you out makes you auto-revert to "you salty". Funny stuff.
---
If I am not mistaken Empath would give me more damage to him, would it not?
---
I am filthier! In since Beta and still only level 30! Muhahaha
---
Are you sure those aren't miniguns?
---
Not too sure why you're bothering to cover his in-game name, people doing this need to be publically named and shamed. This is the kind of kind of crap selfish duping assholes do that causes the massive server lag and fucks the game for everyone. Bethesda really ought to ban people caught doing this IMO.
---
Much love to playing games with your son!! ❤️💜💛
---
So you’re just bitching, got it.  
---
Unfortunately no, I think we should. But then everyone would have every mod in the game. Lol
---
We need more people like you on here.
---
Please explain the possible armor/perk stack? 
---
I have yet to see a valid mathematical example.
---
Impressive, most impressive. That's quite a feat also a great metaphor for fallout. There is no correct way to play, you can get where your going however the hell you want. 
---
Haha.  I'm so frugal with ammunition now I'll end up sneaking up and bashing for the kill.  
---
You're right; I did misunderstand what you said, and I apologize for that. But the reason you're getting downvoted is because you're promoting poor behavior. It's PVP, not 1PV2P.
---
Except Train Train
---
As long as you use high damage guns it doesn't really matter. It's mostly about the crew that arrives. Loads of level 20s? You're going to struggle. Levels over 100? Yeah you'll be fine.
---
To answer the question... I rotate guns to a certain extent. I keep the majority of ammo I find and store it. When ammo runs out I swap something.
---
I carry 4 weapons usually: a melee weapon, a 'fun' weapon, a short-range and long-range weapon.
---
I'm down to one melee weapon now because I sold my others for stash space but I don't use it for scorched beasts unless I run out of ammo. Which is unlikely due to only switching guns in when I have tonnes.
---
The fun gun pretty much stays the same. It's a 2 shot level 10 single action (I'm level 130+) because it's fun not being able to kill everything in seconds.
---
Short range I have a shotgun that I swap out for a minigun. 
---
Long range I have either a hand made or a 10mm machine gun (strange choice I know but I don't have the stash space for loads of guns and the .308 snipers are crap.
---
You still would want a lawyer (Both sides)
---
Surely potatoes have some sort of screenshot functionality...yes? Seems to be able to from the "share" button. 
---
If that is the case, screenshot, and move the file to a pc. Open in photoshop, gimp, w/e. 
---
Wow. Let the great Atom bless you brother. Safe travels on your journey
---
Then I came over and killed him and took his stuff
---
Pistols are a joke.  Too many weak revolvers, not enough hand-cannon tier pistols, or middle semi-automatics.  You're either stuck using a peashooter like the 10mm or .38 pipe pistol, or you pick between 4 single-action revolvers that all kind of handle almost exactly like each other. .45 pipe revolver, .44 pistol, single-action revolver that has a really slow reload, and .44 Western Revolver that pretty much invalidates all the other revolvers, but has shit mods.
---
The class of weapons is in desperate need of something like a .45 auto pistol, and the hunting revolvers from New Vegas.  It's disappointing there is no native non-revolver .45 pistol, and all the 'power' options are pistols are just revolvers that share pretty much the same animations except the single-action one.
---
Not going to even count the laser gun and plasma gun which can be modified to be pistols, because energy weapons have their own set of problems.
---
Oh that’s nice to know. Sure my character probably has nuclear aids by now!
---
4 is a way better game.

I hate to be that guy, but there is a search function on Reddit. This gets asked *a lot*.
---
That would be true... if I was making it up. *shrug*
---
Also kind of funny that someone telling factual information is called "a kid making stuff up".
---
I'm sorry that you feel the need to call other people name's to try to get your point across. Sadly, it isn't quite working.
---
Get out of the PA... all the defense perks don’t work inside PA
---
Right but I'm also still not promoting it, I was just making a joke about a raider raider having a problem with it. 
---
That's true. It's normally some high level stuff I've just made 
---
yeah, plus barbarian. if your strength is 15 taking more than 1 level is pointless because it's capped at 40. But it's really effective. Also damage resistance while moving, damage resistance while carrying junk, etc etc
---
I think biocom is just for torsos
---
I know but my build using power armor because of stabilized for heavy guns and because I’m always in nuke zones 
---
So worth it though, nice walking through watoga and having all those bots on your side, Kiting SB to watoga makes farming them simple.
---
Save yourself the time and money and play Battlefield 4. Fallout 76 is fun and all but not worth the price it’s at. 
---
I don’t know man. I kind of feel like the whole point is that it’s this cheesy tourist trap that’s working hard to build up this mysterious backstory to visit this kind of small and crappy tourist cave. Like the Bat Boy in Lost World Caverns. I think actually having a monster would defeat the point and not make a whole lot of sense fictionally. 
---
Yeah, but you clearly said it was illegal and whoever did it would be a criminal. Like, the police would be out to arrest them. 
---
Have they actually started to answer tickets?
---
uninstall and reinstall while at work.
---
Not very, especially if it's a request they shouldn't recieve in the first place.
---
They can't restore items.
---
I'm going to say for what you are looking for this is your game. There are patches and updates in the works, and despite all the negative press I really do enjoy the game. 
---
Adrenal reaction is excellent, everyone seems to forget it
---
Isn't that black diamond? Like the ski trail category.
---
Holy shit, this is getting out of hand. Here I am still trying to get a tse weapon to drop since release and these jokers have millions of everything. I got booted over 10 times last night. Bethesda needs to do something about this fast, but we all know they wont. 
---
I feel you homie
---
why would i know this? for real think about it, at what point in the game do you learn this? regardless blue prints are still dumb when you have to unlock the perks and get all required materials. it's too much to be worth the effort.
---
PC.  It didn't matter which workhop, certain people will pvp entire servers.  You make enough caps doing it that you can just fast travel to every workshop and PVP the owners.  They earn caps and get free junk too.  As long as you have a teammate to take your bounty, you can even break into a well fortifed workshop.  
---
The system doesn't work, and all you really need to easily take advantage of it is chameleon and a one shot weapon.
---
Hahahahaha .... TSE.
---
Look. Is this question really even serious? The amount of information out there about the TSE is beyond what is out there for most other stuff concerning this game.
---
I am sure if you wanna hit the easy button, you can use the caps on you melee character to buy a TSE in the fallout 76 bazzar and have a friend help you transfer it to your new character.
---
I'ma tell you now ... TSE is more boring than being a Melee character. Honestly, try a harder build were you need to pay attention and invest smartly or die a lot, lol.
---
Farming one is just ... good luck. Explosive is easy as hell to get but anything good along with it, thats the hard part. You already seem to know where to farm as well.
---
Definitely only in emote though. I'd hate to put a target on my back in the name of not scaring lowbies. But for sure an emote, or some other way to choose to indicate in a particular moment that you are in pacifist. 
---
I dont know if it's possible with the engine. 
---
They only really steal XP (which is super annoying), and it's a guilty pleasure sometimes.  One time there was a ton of glowing ones at the golf club in a nice mosh pit looking setup with some players piddling them down.  
---
My combat TSE took them all out in 1 beautiful shot and I got \~5,500 XP in that one swift group kill. I was laughing my butt off imaging those folks being really pissed about that. 
---
But granted I do try to keep etiquette of using my instigating sledge and only going after glowing ones others have damaged.  But when I do see a jacka$$(s) just using TSE, then it becomes a take the kills before they do priority over others without TSE's kind of thing. 
---
If they crash out that might be a good thing though to get them out of there to make the area more fair for others :)
---
Must have belonged to count chockula
---
Get both, they are both great games :)
---
Refunded some atoms and it only took them about 1.5 days to get it all finished. Refunded atoms and let me keep the item! Not all experiences are bad..
---
This is fundamentally a duping problem.  That's the only way you're reasonably going to get dozens or hundreds of the same bobblehead.
---
You're not factoring everything in.
---
Natural armor, scaly skin, evasive, bodyguards, barbarian and ironclad all increase base DR. Dodgy reduces your damage by 30%. Sentinel effects reduces your damage by another 75%. If he was in a group with someone that had Empath your damage is reduced by another 25%. If he and that person also had strange in numbers then his DR/damage taken is reduced even further.
---
The build does exist.
---
Hard to say. I prefer fo76s world as there are other ppl in it.
---
Basebuilding is better in fo4 but only you will see it.
---
I worry that it won't get picked up by anybody. I don't need acknowledgement of my actions but I also don't want to waste my resources needlessly. I have enough to go around but not enough to feed the ground. Or something. It rhymed so I typed it.
---
Nice!!! I drop 80% of legendary items I wont use in random places for others to find. Selling them doesnt make enough caps plus it helps others on their journey in the wasteland.
---
I wouldn't trust the spaghetti code that would require in the engine LOL
---
So it should increase the effects of dysentery.
---
that was me with mine, just got on gathered the last materials and built the full set. as soon as it was done i disconnected. joined back on my friend and the armor was there mocking me unable to be interacted with or recovered
---
On my current character I am no longer able to craft it. I did the quest, logged out, logged back in and I cannot craft it. I go back to the workstation where you get the plans and download them and it says offloaded to external storage or whatever but I still cannot make them. So....fuck me right
---
And THIS is exactly why I don’t accept team invites from strangers, it’s really easy to destroy a team members base if they aren’t around.
---
It is a violation of the terms an agreement. If 30% of the player base is doing I would hope they would ban them. They don’t add anything productive to the game.
---
Don't let the salty posters stop you.  Get on one of the trade subreddits, do a little searching, find your playstyle.  Most hating on TSE are those without them or people who think that removing them will fix pvp which is laughable.  If you are on PC, prepare to pay 5-20k caps depending on which TSE you are after.  Good luck!
---
Yesterday I saw 3 at the exact same location (bottom right of the map). So boring... Bethesda really needs to tune down the resources at that location so people will fire it at other locations as well.
---
shit, 12k. Too bad that duping ruined the game and my got-to guy sells it in bulks for 100c each...
---
If you make a hundred TSE shotties or HMR, and you sell 5 on eBay, you can buy an extra account and have an alt you can directly trade with. Voila instant storage. 
---
same reasoning as OP
---
Why?  Because he's already stated he's underequipped.  That's why. :)
---
He could go into harder areas, but the leveled enemies will be strong.  He can do whatever he likes, that's just my advice, having done it, myself.
---
The feels. Sands.
---
They might not be additive so you won't see 60% drops.
---
Are they just not reducing at all?
---
Ya I have been spending the last couple days making and scraping handmades to get the automatic receiver
---
Both are good I still play both.. Depends on if you wanna play with NPCs or real people though, that's the real question that will help you make your decision. 
---
I just think making up things and then telling people you shouldnt have to provide any proof or evidence and they should take you at your word to be childish. Taking that into account and you do things like "shrug" I have to naturally assume you are either immature, or a weeb. Sorry if that hurt your feelings, didnt think you would be that sensitive.
---
That being said this has devolved into a measuring contest instead of a discussion. You claimed something, I disagreed, you said to pvp and tell you you are wrong, I did. You then said you dont need to show any proof and people should take you at your word, I disagreed and said thats dumb. Dont think any resolution or middle ground will be met here, so I guess im done discussing this with you since its not really a discussion anymore.
---
True I was being more vague, breach of conduct what ever it is. What as was trying to get it there could be consequences 
---
I'm still waiting on response from something I submitted on the 18th of last month. So glacially would be the answer to your question.
---
People worrying about the economy are drastically blowing it out of proportion. Most people arent affectrd by the economy in way, form, or fashion. The "economy being destoryed" amounts to your dog destroying one sock in your house...its just not a big deal. The economy doesnt really exist. 
---
Also, people arent running around with duped weapons 1 shotting everyone. Its simply not happening and anyone saying it is is a fucking liar. Ive seen people one shotting mobs, yea. Ive even been shot by them, but unless you engage them in pvp...its a non-issue. You might miss out on some tags, but thata about it.
---
Vendor prices arent affected by the player economy, and unless you plan on scrounging around one 3rd party websites trying to sell your wares; you wont be affected by it either. 
---
The 5 strangers youre going to trade with in your first 50 hours of gameplay arent going to significantly impact your gameplay.  You really dont bump into people all that often.
---
PVP is avoidable and not worth worrying about. You can play this like a single player game, although I play with 1 friend...we have tons of fun. We rarely run into anyone outside of nuke zones. 
---
Theres going to be a lot of patches. Theres one coming near the end of this month and this will be the 3rd or 4th one already.

Well I got dystentery from a damn eyebot last night, so I'd say your doing pretty good.

Yea it sounds like he went there and trashed your base. Then scrapped a few objects.
---
No they are. It usually works if i relog a few times so i can see what the weight is really meant to be. Then i relog again and the weps are back to full weight. 
---
What system are you on? I have 300 and need to lose some to make room in my stash. I’m on xbox
---
I have to ask the questions that pertain to my concerns. These concerns are specifically for the Xbox One community. (Not X) Someone else's situation and concerns may not be the same as mine.
---
&gt;If you're not so good at shooters, allow me to suggest a 15 AGI/LCK revolver build.
---
I'd love to see a link to your build.   :) 
---
My first character (she's level 73) is a rifle build and I just created a second character to give pistols a run. I'm having the same issue on this alt that you described - I keep playing as if I'm using rifles! This is my first Fallout game (I picked a doozy, hey?) and the perks elude me sometimes. I'd like to reverse engineer what you picked to better understand the perk system. 
---
I'm in my 40s and recently left another MMO for being told repeatedly by younger players that I wasn't "good enough" even though I kept to casual circles. FO76 (both game and its community) have been a great place to rebuild my confidence.
---
I'd love the help, that way I don't suck when I play with my kids! Thanks in advance.
---
Very very rare and not seen in larger companies. Expecting this is setting yourself up for disappointment. Even if they “want to make a good game” they want it to be good for money. Almost nobody wants to make you a game out of the goodness of their hearts. 
---
Being resourceful and looking for answers on your own as well as using search functions is hardly worthless, it has helped my career and makes me good money.
---
My snark reflected the effort OP put in to find the information before asking others. It is admittedly a pet peeve of mine.
---
Thanks for your opinion but I will continue to disagree.
---
Battlefield 4? I'm looking for a relaxing single player experience.
---
I’ll be your son. 
---
Oh I glitched and lost my pa with tons of mods
---
I’m still waiting to hear about my canvas bag...
---
thanks! i recently completed the enclave questline so I'll settle near a nuke site
---
I assume I got yours. It isn't letting me accept it for some reason, though. All done, though. Launching nuke in like 2 seconds. Lol
---
You can add me and your fiance to your list, lol. She gets so nervous about social interaction she can barely play. 
---
you haven't played and experimented as much as you think if you don't know.
---
For sure. Launching nuke now. :D
---
Higher levels have a higher cap. So it goes like +2 per point max 40, +3 per point max 60, and +4 per point max 80. So if you have rank 3 you get +4 defense per point with a max of 80. If your Strength is 15 that is 4x15 which is 60, but you can increase strength even higher with other items, perks and consumables, so you can get that 80 with 20 strength. If you run a high rad build that's easy because Radicool in Endurance gives you up to +5. Or if you have Party Boy or Girl in Charisma it can double or triple the effects of alcohol. So if a bottle of alcohol gives you 2 then you can get 4 or 6 strength from it. There's also Unyielding armor that gives you up to +3 SPECIAL to all stats except for Endurance the lower your health. Etc.
---
damn thanks, I didn't even know most of these vendors existed haha
---
If 3 still a fun world to explore?
---
Between 3 and 4 whats the better story?
---
Oof near the end of the month? Maybe I should wait to see how that pans out. Thanks for the response!
---
Valid point, my apologies.
---
&gt; People worrying about the economy are drastically blowing it out of proportion. Most people arent affectrd by the economy in way, form, or fashion. The "economy being destoryed" amounts to your dog destroying one sock in your house...its just not a big deal. The economy doesnt really exist. 
---
Yeah, like I haven't had need to do a single trade with another player in the game, ever.
---
It's immaterial to talk about how many screws you have without knowing how much TIME you spent picking up tagged items.
---
Junk piles in workshops make it something that happens faster.
---
This is exactly what i do ALL DAY. 50% are really appreciative and the rest...well the rest just keeps begging for more without even a "Thank you" back. 20% of the ppl i help even go so far as DEMAND stuff. "Give me some stimpacks and food" is not an unusual request.
---
I held the Charleston workshop last night for what had to be a few hours. I get the quest update that it was under attack. I thought it was another NPC defense. So I fast traveled back, only to find a lvl 31 took it over, I'm level 62 and was wearing power armor, he was not. 
---
When he came down the stairs of the building I built, he was red and pointing his gun at me but never fired.
---
I put my gun away, gave him the heart signal, dropped my extra plans and recipes, then went to my  camp and then went to bed. Hope you got plenty of junk, sir!
---
Grind or cheat.  I have found a 2 shot assault rifle. No explosive though. Im level 134 from grinding whitesprings. 
---
Hi, I don’t think you understand “passive” mode properly
---
Whether you are in that mode or not, you would experience the same result, UNTIL you shot back of course
---
There's no mapped push to talk feature for controllers. 
---
Would you?
---
Rule 9
---
Good to know, I'd never experienced that before

Why would a duper complain about being overpowered? Use your brain dude.
---

---
Dunno) I never tried. 
---
my dad is about 45 and i’m ending high school , and one thing we share is the obsession with the fallout franchise. over the two weeks of christmas break id like to say that we have played almost &gt;5 hours a day (it was well needed) and have loved this game and being able to play with each other, despite the countless crashes, overencumberment, griefers, etc. glad you got to share this experience as well!
---
Its best to use repair all at the CAMP unit because it will repair items that scorchbeasts completely trash.  There is also a perk card that makes it cheaper.  My experience says base items are cheaper to fix unlike power armor pieces.
---
What are you talking about? It's the same game across all platforms. Patches are just slower to roll out because of Sony/Microsoft requirements. 
---

Scorched killers receiver adds a legendary star to weapons (AFAIK the only way to have a 4* current), but prime receiver does not. 
---
Related suggestion: currently all legendaries show 1* regardless of effects. An item name with 2** next to it is a team member quest item. Change team member quest items to show a circle °¤⊙ of some sort, and allow the number of stars to show the number of legendary effects. 
---
It's very easy to get, I only keep 100 in my stash and vendor the rest if I ever need more. I think ive seen it used in repairs, mod build for weapons and that's about it. I'm not into serums yet so I can't say anything along those lines. 
---
GTA still has duping years after release. There's people that *just* come up with ways of doing it.
---
But, to be fair, they also patch dupe glitches crazy fast (Sometimes in hours) and monitor sales and inventory a lot closer.
---
To be fair, I was doing Mayor For A Day, used the stove and stash box in Bog Town and got a wanted status.  I didn't even notice until someone killed me randomly and I got 10 caps taken out of my purse.  I didn't even notice it was owned, nor had I ever been there before to know what was placed by a player or normally there (not sure if it matters, since I don't really mess with workshops aside from taking 20 free caps for clearing out the area).  I was just making some food and got killed immediately after making some cranberry juice and brain fungus soup.  I heard power armor next to me, and was preparing to give a hello emote.  LOL.  I respawned and told the guy that I left a bunch of ammo and junk in the Red Rocket cash register in case he wanted it, and apologized for unintentionally messing with his place.  He was nice and offered a trade of 5 scrap silver for free to give me back my 10 caps.
---
At the very least, it would be cool if we were warned about encroaching on someone's workshop before we get an automatic wanted status for using a stash box, breaking down junk or making food.  I'm close to level 110, and this is the second time I ignorantly used someone's workshop benches and got a bounty.  I really hate having a bounty, as I try to go above and beyond to help people out and it gives me a sense of shame when I do it unintentionally.  I'll definitely stop and check the map to see if a workshop is owned whenever I came near one in the future.
---
I don't mind the mild PVP aspect of the game at all.  I personally don't choose to participate in the aggressive aspect of it, but I'm cool with elective PVP participation and taking out trolls.  I just think it would be nice to have a clear warning to let you know you're encroaching on a spot.  I'd personally elect to stay encumbered and find other crafting stations to break down junk rather than get a wanted status.
---
Glad you found them :D
---
Then replies to his own post: They downvote me cause they hate me. Instant upvotes. This sub is a joke.
---
There was a worldwide shortage jeez
---
Not for xo-1.......
---
I had a bunch of extra ammo, so I went to the overseers camp and dropped a bag of it off for a new player.  As soon as I got his attention and made sure he got the bag, I fast travelled away.
---
As the load screen chugged, I could hear him say “he took off?  No he gave ME ammo?!?!”  Almost as if someone was expecting me to attack him.
---
Lol people will run from me and I just wanted to give them free stuff, I still haven't seen any trolling so I dont get it. 
---
That's how I got my x-01 plans.
---
I dont know that its an "oof". 4 patches in 9 weeks is a lot more than other games see. But if youre on the fence you can wait and see how it pans out. 
---
Theyve got some patch notes/styff out so you can read what theyre planning. Might give you an idea of what to expect. 
---
I’ve been playing on PC since Reclamation/Release Day and have had nothing by good interactions with other players. 
---
The only time I was killed by another player is when I joined their workshop defense event and accidentally pinged them with my 10mm. We stared at each other for 2 seconds and they oneshotted me back to CAMP. And that was fine.
---
Not everyone takes their role seriously 100% of the time, you know.
---
You could make a new character, use it until you find the plans.
---
Reapairing is a fraction of the cost of making from scratch so that is always best. As for protecting valuable stuff, I use the large concrete blockers. They are nice and tall and have plenty of health. But scorchbeast are a different story, theres really nothing you can do to protect your base from one except for luring it away.
---
Seeing as nobody linked it already for some reason, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a10iwa/how_to_get_the_handmade_rifle_schematics_after/) details how you get handmade plans at higher levels

There’s a new rule that criticizing the game isn’t allowed. Todd is paying people to downvote them into OBLIVION(hehe)
---
I've never once had anyone come after Charleston landfill while I had it.
---
But if they want it, they're more than welcome to suck on the end of my furious combat shotgun.
---
Thats using a melee wsapon, which is generally considered one of the more OP weapon type due to sheer damage and the ability to ignore 75% of an opponents armor. The other OP weapon being TSE guns.
---
Any other weapon just becomes a drawn out battle.

As long as you don't open with, "hey what's up guys?!" Post that baby!
---
It always makes me mad when people nuke half of whitespring leaving half the houses out of the circle. But it’s worse when someone can’t use radx, power armor, or server hop!
---
I stimpak anyone who needs it (if I can make it in time). Stimpaks are cheap and plentiful if you know where to go, might as well save someone a trip back to their loot.

Can it be collected?

I dont thiml you can scrap items in a teammates base. I know you can place stuff but I could be wrong about the scrapping thing.

I run two instances on two accounts of the game from a single install so I can say the game is stable.  I run on a 2nd gen i7-3870, 40gb Ram and gtx 1060 3GB.  I have had one account  in a queen fight while the other stayed at the watoga vendor and it ran without issue.  
---
I run on medium settings, windowed (makes for easier swapping) with 1 screen on each monitor.  Like most issues with PC games, its in your setup/install so a fresh install may be the next best step.
---
&gt;Almost nobody wants to make you a game out of the goodness of their hearts.
---
Of course not because of pure altruism, but because they want to play it too. ;)
---
I only made it to 21 before I stopped playing largely because every time I did I got a migraine.  I'm really not sure what it is about 76 but it's never happened with any other game, even other Fallout games.
---
Ghouls seem to hit me very hard in PA no matter what damage reduction perk/mod I use. Its like their damage pierces through everything. 
---
bless your heart, i rather fight two scorchbeast queens at once than a mirelurk queen.
---
Scorch beasts are pretty ridiculous. Hitting a moving target in any situation is going to be difficult but when you are pint blank on enemies and shot aren’t registering it’s a problem. You can’t be sure if you are just missing your shots or you are at the mercy of Bethesda’s glitches. 
---
Treating this "multiplayer fun loot and shoot" as a singleplayer game or even singleplayer fallout doesn't work IMHO.
---
The game will look and run differently between platforms. I am not referring to who gets patches first.

This happens when the small power armor station is placed to close to a wall

Not true. Games *do* differ even from XB1 to XB1X. Had many issues with No Man's Sky on the One X that standard One players didn't have, and vice versa.
---
Lol, I'd gladly trade you. I miss having this work.
---
you can mix and match, 
---
your not counting damage restiance on pieces. You can go higher than 400 easily in regular armor with perks and drugs. 
---
Your basing your knowledge on math that is incorrect and experience. He's not a hacker - learn from this or get frustrated and dramatic. Paper scissors rock and you bought the lesser in this fight. 
---
mutations are also probably at play.
---
he could of hand the Dodge perk and you missed also.
---
you don't know what he's wearing and xo1 armor has lower Dr than t51b.

The fact that you don't know that shows you are not as learned as you think grass Hopper.

My CAMP is set up on the road just north of Charleston Landfill but every time I log in, try to claim it before heading out exploring, its been bugged out and the enemies I have to "clear" don't appear. 
---
True, but reddit is not the bug report path for Bethesda. You need to go to the Bethesda support page and fill out a support request with the details of the bug. Posting here is about karma and ego farming.
---
Sulphuric drinking fountain at white springs? How have I not seen that yet I go there so much 
---
Correct. However, there is only one primary perk on each piece possible. By using the best one for damage resistance at full health (not a bloodied type scenario) we have sentinel. With sentinel maxed, it cannot take 2k damage into only 5% loss of health bar. The numbers just arent there man.
---
Yeah, I'm talking more about regular PvP without using broken weapons. It's just not worth the waste of resources.
---
Explosive shotguns are ridiculous right now because the explosive effect seems to apply to all pellets and theres no damage drop off for the explosive damage. It's worse the Destiny 2s explosive rounds. 
---
true, could of had a buddy stealthed off somewhere hosting just soaking up damage on the roof or something.
---
Kind of agree. If you have over 1000 weight you shouldn't be able to move or open a trade window. Though, people could still drop items, makes it easy to scam a duper!
---
Good idea

---
Webster Springs WV has this in real life!
---
Level 175 here, Beta start. Grinding nonstop. No duped weapons, no exploits and even a full time job. Best way to level is grind nuke events for xp and claim / defend / retake every workshop you see. You can level up pretty fast, although it serves no real advantage and the game can't even display your level properly on the map after level 100.
---
Id just be interested in seeing whats available/in-store. Itd break the point of playing to take anything though. Id feel differently if it were singleplayer though haha
---
Try it
---
I don't even do Rose's questline on my alts, I go straight to enclave. 
---
Perhaps, but even after moving it and using other stations mine still glitched
---
Oh now I remember I saw that too! And there was a reference in fallout 4 about it. I believe it said something about that the first fat man even created failed because it wasn’t safe for the soldiers who fired it. But at this time I didn’t knew it was referring to a real world weapon. 
---
Bwahahaha. That makes absolutely no sense. You aren't meant to dupe, you have to force a server disconnect and role back to dupe. Don't try to justify something everyone clearly knows is wrong. Duping by the definition you put forward an exploit. /Youdontunderstandcheckersletalonechess
---
It's mole rat chunks that buff strength though.
---
For low level, events are pretty solid.
---
Bruh. Do you even marsupial?
---
Wife here. Ouch :(
---
Strength Perk
---
I don’t know who’s more disappointed you or your avatar lol
---
He’s like
---
“Seriously I’m not level one anymore...”
---
try the western pistol. With the right upgrades you one shot a lot of stuff. At least I do and I have 3 perception. 
---
Even if you need violet or crimson flux, the best way is probably to alternate between whitesprings and cranberry bog. Whitesprings just gives you so much spare glowing/hardened mass.
---
Junk piles seem to produce screws super slowly. It produces all sorts of rubber (and that is super useful!), ceramic, etc. But screws produce really slowly. Springs?  Practically not at all. You’d be much better off making a scavenger run to grab &amp; scrap junk than wait 45 minutes for the extractor to pop out one screw and half a spring
---
Get the first one at level 30 I think
---
I mean...its one of the reasons it crashes
---
I won’t be under powered (level 17 with pretty good loot a high level friend helped me out) and my friend is a level 18 decent loot
---
Keep going with Rose. The main quest is kind of short and will introduce you to every single factions.
---
Dude same. Played the beta. I play off and on, am also level 32. I want to get a lot higher level but the game just gets so boring sometimes without any good quests to go on. I mean I think I got my preorder money's worth out of it. The scenery is great, the environment is pretty cool (aside from those DANG scorchbeasts). But the quick enemy respawns and the lack of any real NPC interaction just makes it pretty boring to me after awhile. On again off again, that's how I feel.
---
I've not had any either, the Blade of Bastet has been my no.1 for so long we have a bond between us.
---
I keep experimenting this bug no matter what kind of gun I use, and thus I switched to a melee build 
---
Ops. Thx for noticing. It was chest arms and legs. Fixed now 
---
Its not a Bug Its a Photo you Made 
---
Thank you, that was the issue. I appreciate it 😁
---
Where exactly is it?
---
What are you, some kind of dog food gourmet?
---
The proper way is to crack open a syringe of psycho and pour it in so you can make a thick, rich irrational anger soup.
---
No, like everyone else who would like certain things implemented while sorting their inventory, this is just another time consuming factor with an easy solution.
---
I shouldnt have to pull all of my armor out of my 
---
STASH and apply it to be able to fully know what it is.
---
so they can make bobble heads valuable again.
---
Nah i just wait for em to die so i can steal their junk so I can annoy them.
---
I wouldn’t go as far to say I am upset.
---
Im not an idiot, I got rid of all my important junk before attacking him.
---
If he has amassed 1000c bounty, obviously he is not going down easy.
---
What you are correct about is my lack of knowledge on the billions of perks and bonuses you can get to make yourself invincible.
---
The reason I made this post is to find out if there is a way to make an invincible character ingame, or if he was using an exploit.
---
If he was in fact using a flurry of armours and perks to literally not be killable, I just want to know how so I can make my own set of it.
---
I shall begin my journey (just for you) in building this armor set, and attaching all these serums and perks and chems to speak of. Then I will have a friend blow me away with my own gun (and same perks) and see of he can only do 5% damage. Of he can, I will comment back here telling you you are correct.
---
Until then, everyone you say is in theory, not in actuality so I choose not to rule out an exploit as of yet.
---
This is the scripted equivalent of a YouTube video, please when making a title like this, just get directly to the point.
---
Exactly 
---
Get a big bag of Doritos and leave your mic on as the developers intended.
---
Or just steal the loot lol.
---
I found the obstacle course really frustrating.  I'm not into repeating things endlessly, that just sucks and it's a good way to get burned out on a game.  So I tried for a mutation once a day for about a week as I did other things.   I also collected the 2nd level of Starched Genes perk card under luck.  After about a week of radiation treatments, once a day, I got the marsupial mutation, then equipped starched genes.  Now I could just jump over the balance beams.   The marsupial mutation is definitely worth having. 
---
For the shooting course, I used the assault rifle, and started in the middle of all the signs.  Got it pretty quickly that way.  
---
How much longer you think?
---
Game is Pretty evil when coming to damage reduction.
---
High hp help in no way without damage reduction.
---
I advise getting perk that "lower damage taken".
---
My character have Only 145 dr, however i have lone wanderer, supressor and the One that reduce melee damage taken. I cani Tank evrything except explosions.
---
I was actually wanting to put a box out for people to take stuff from but realised it would get them a bounty.
---
Im not sure but I hope that is where Bethesda got the inspiration for the fat man
---
I did it yesterday and got a laser gun plan. It's a guaranteed weapon plan drop but the weapon is random.
---
Step one to reproducing this amazing bug you found:
---
"consume hundreds of weapon or explosive damage bobbleheads"
---
Something you cannot do in the game without first breaking the game, or buying hundreds of bobbleheads from someone who broke the game. It's like me saying "Bethesda! I took the disc out of the PS4, snapped it in half, and when I put it back in, it doesn't work! FIX YOUR GAME!" This isn't the Bethesda bug queue, so you're being completely disingenuous about pretending to be some kind of white hat by posting this here.
---
"I saw a guy killing a queen with a few shots. Me &amp; my friends figured they might stacked bobbleheads. So we had to test it."
---
The character portrait is a photo. The level is listed on the ID and should update with the character.
---
I think I stuck to heavy combat armor - but thats how I set up followers usually.
---
The server crashed while I was in the middle of the DMV quest last night. Good thing I was drunk or I would have been extremely agitated.
---
By getting it nerfed? That's what this dude is asking for. Again, critical thinking use it.
---
I mean in theory, wouldn’t just a set of sentinel and the dodgy perk make you invincible?
---
That would be 105% damage reduced.
---
Is this correct math?
---
Causal night playing for a few hours..LVL25 on PS4.   Minionwon
---
You have to deal with a couple deathclaw, that's all.
---
I'm on Xbox and created an alt, leveled up, got to Harper's Ferry
---
By the point that, when looking at a Deathclaw, I mostly seen +2 str deathclaw steaks, I was still afraid of blood bugs.
---
I mean mosquito is the #1 human killer worldwide, mutated mosquito is like the worst there could be
---
Well thats sucks 
---
I had the same problem with the power armor station at my camp since i placed it in the middle of the room it works properly.
---
Break this down for me. Am n00b to TSE. Explosive damage perks affect them?
---
I can be close to 1000 if I remove my weight reduction perks. Could be over as I have been if I do a bunch of runs on Whitesprings. I don't think that is a great idea, as it just punished people who want to collect guns and armor. 1000 lbs is nothing really. If you have a stack of 1000 rifles then that's gonna be a lot more than 1000 lbs.
---
I understand it is part of the game, until they begin hunting me from server to server
---
If you haven’t played 3 or NV, they’re both worth a play through, especially since you can get them way cheaper than 4 or 76. 
---
I think NV has the best overall world to explore if you get all the DLCs. 
---
it has been nerfed I feel. it used to proc all the time now it's way way less. Oh well
---
Ya my purifiers do the same
---
Even for Marine and Combat armors?
---
&gt; (level 106) standing on the overseer’s cache in the overseer’s camp
---
Someone tell me if I'm wrong, but doesn't you being uber level scale up the surrounding area, to the detriment of the newbies?
---
One gripe I keep having is that if I'm within a mile of someone who is level 50+, the area's mobs then turns to be scaled to them, and not me who is level 22ish.
---
I just had a final straw out by the ski resort. I was find killing super mutants (super mutants in a Bethesda Fallout being a seperate gripe) just fine before. Then I notice they jumped to levels 48 and 50. So I look at the map and before where there was no one in the area there's now a level 78 guy at the next map marker over.
---
So what the fuck am I supposed to do about that? Just server hop if someone high level comes close? Just abandon that mission for the day (because god knows what they're doing and how long they'll be there, or if they decided to start farming there).?
---
Yes there is also one for 45% armor penetration
---
Why not server hop to an unoccupied workshop...
---
Can you collect out of it?
---
apparently each purified water maker just adds to the storage (i think the one you are talking about holds 5 at a time) they dont each make water on there own. or something like that.
---
rolled an alt for this purpose, should hit 100 today  will report back.
---
It will be random sometimes, I've had caps not reset for days, and also reset 4 times in the hour. 
---
Wanna know something funny? I just meandered my way to the swamp and lo and behold, ticks! LEVEL 8 TICKS. I'm level 21 right now. I think the marsh is safer than the fucking Divide!
---
It's always been that way. I've got so many duplicated plans since day 1. Try switching up which workshops you're doing.
---
I wanted to start a shop and sell them in bulks of 5 for a cap guess not :/
---
You just sound salty tbh, most high levels PvPing couldn't give a shit about your measly pocket full of caps. Most are having fun in a limited endgame. The term "griefing" is parroted all over this subreddit but I don't believe in the word; pvp is pvp, if you cant hang go do something else. 
---
There is something primal, territorial, and special about taking what's yours, and around Appalachia, anything I desire is mine. If you don't like it I'm sure you can write a report to Bethesda about their game working as intended to vent your frustrations. 
---
If it benefits you ,why don't do it?Your benefit is more important than any activity any player would do on that server  , and they would just find another server if you crash that one.
---
That so sad 😭 
---
This is a shame
---
 For exploring you can not beat 76, its huge and there is stuff all over. 
---
 Base building is more restricted in 76 and requires plans for many things. In 4 you can build bigger and the various things you can build, unlock much easier.
---
  Now 76 is the better game, but the rest is up to you.
---
The real bobblehead was the friends we made along the way
---
The level is the level of which you took the picture.
---
No, I'm just a sucker for trying to cram in some Dune references. 
---
Again, thanks for all the work arounds, but i havent the desire to port anything to a PC that i dont have just to edit it, for what?
---
Id like the function ive suggested so that i can edit action shots to use the pics for loading screens. 
---
Like i started with, im not SUPER into taking photos, but being able to alter older saved photos by at least changing the filter would be nice.
---
Just getting new cards really. I have a 76, 65, 51, and 35 so if I didn’t have 4 characters I’d be....a lot higher
---
I have a clip of me leveling a base in 10 seconds and another of me one shotting an AFK player in PA, if you want to see them. It very much so does the job lol I dont think you know much about weapons haha
---
I dunno, doubt it. Comment was out of desire not practicality :)
---
Anyone can see for themselves in the game, if they are interested. 
---
I'm sorry that the word "shrug" triggers you so much. But hey, keep calling names to people you don't know at all, that's so mature! *shrug*
---
Thanks for the tl;dr. I needed it.
---
Drop stabilizer or drop the bloodied... one won’t work with the other. 
---
As for nuke zones, as of right now, it’s PA/Hazmat or gtfo; unfortunately. I would love to romp around a nuke zone popping radshield, rad-x, with a full set of rad resist-modded armor but it just ain’t in the cards right now. I hope it’s addressed soon. PAs are clunky, loud, have shitty headlamps, and that bouncy vision... I hate em. 
---
I would recommend /r/fo76bazaar/ or the looking for group section on Xbox lots of users selling there
---
After murdering the queen, put on Green Thumb and check for ferns near trees in Cranberry Bog. Get your glowing &amp; hardened mass from Whitesprings.
---
I don't know if there are better ways, but as people always nuke Prime or Whitesprings, you don't have to go out of your way.
---
Thanks bro. Ive actually started stocking up on adhesives. But i burn through them like crazy. I really just need gears and rad mats for Fusion Gens for my workshops. I dont get the salt. I dont normally take workshops besides junkyards because they have a lucrative amount of scrap. Its pvp and thats why i play this game. I played rogue in wow from vanilla to wrath so im used to people sending me a wall of text hate.
---
Pc lyfe broheim! &lt;3
---
Totally with you ... I turn 53 this year and my son turns 19 ...both of us are Fall Out junkies and we play FO76 nearly every day although I do play more ... (mostly grinding and scrapping for screws and springs and other crafting mats for the both of us) ... nothing better than running a quest arc together!!
---
Bless your soul. 
---
I didn't read the wall of text, and refuse to click the video link for fear of a 30 minute video. Where is the TLDR. 
---
I found for Combat Armor Arms (as seen in the video) and earlier for the chest piece, which I didn't save the recording of seeing as I already had that recipe and wasn't thinking of sharing this in that very moment. I don't remember if I saw for Marine "limbs" or "legs" but I've seen at least one of those.
---
So yes, as far as I can tell, it's very likely that this vendor is selling *all* Deep-Pocketed plans. Simply a matter of luck, I guess.
---
I'll agree this one. I'm almost to the point of returning the thing. 
---
Oh, you want to play with your wife or friends? Nah. 
---
Almost positive Ive got more time restarting and reporting crashes than actual game play. 
---
nice comment bro
---
They were using sony as an excuse but when sony backed down on cross platform they just said they didnt have plans to make it cross platform.
---
The thing is,  they DON'T all kill in one shot. Black Powder weapons are basically meant to snipe people. If you miss,  you're stuck in a long reload animation and without the sneak attack bonus, it's becomes harder to one shot people. If someone gets up in your face, you're in a much worse position. With TSE weapons? Doesn't matter. A fully automatic gun will one shot you from range, up close, sneak attack or no.
---
Weapon balance in the game is garbage. 
---
Let's get it stable on each platform first. 
---
Stabilized makes heavy guns ignore armor how does that not stack with bloodied?
---
But he won't get good eq if he fights against low lvl enemies. 
---
And since Allrise is pretty popular I wouldn't even call a normal supersledge underequipped and t60 is also at least a budget pa used by many high lvl players.
---
You can take more photos throughout your journey. These will randomly be your load screens. They all show the level that you were when you took the photo.
---
1 way to find out though... Im going in brb
---
Plus pvp can help with some downtime in this game. I love bountyhunting too. 
---
My base is close to their, I go there frequently for the raider faction vendor with the way caps limit works hope I’m not inconvenienceing lower levels with all the mole miners that swarm me 
---
My question is how the heck do you get a wall sized poster?!
---
Or just buy 100 and dupe it.
---
I agree with you, but I’d prefer they fix the other 10,000 things wrong with the game first
---
That is fucking ridiculous. Ask for a fix; Bethesda makes it WORSE. Somehow, I am not even surprised any longer. 
---
I used to wonder how the stuff they do got through QA. I have realized the fallacy in my line of thinking, was my misguided belief that Bethesda HAS a QA team (or bothers to listen to it, if they do). 
---
This studio is a joke.
---
Look around the Moonshiner's shack, the treehouse near the Vault and the pond near the Abandoned shack.  I've gotten squirrels, chickens, possums, foxes and radstags around there.  There is also a small cooking cabin near the treehouse that usually has a recipe or two on the counter.
---
The largest one it says produces 60/h 
---
That's far from 1 every half a hour 
---
You know, after the crap the game has given me today (level 80 Scorchbeasts that I can neither fight nor avoid; server lag; disconnects; stutter) I have half a mind to turn OFF Push to Talk, turn ON my vacuum cleaner and just roam the map for an hour or so. 
---
GANK SQUAAAAAAD
---
Hey how about you give us your in-game name so you can get banned for duping.
---
Both there is no definitive setting really it's based on player and zone. And even then still random af.
---
Plus they never have anything of value on them in my experience.
---
That’s probably where they got it. 
---
I mean if the enemies are low when you go there I dont think it changes a bunch
---
The game play is similar to any other fallout as far as combat goes and loot is similar to fallout 4.  This game is enjoyable playing solo or with friends, that other guy is misleading you. 
---
How dare you criticize the game. Banned.
---
I’m in let me load on my GT is same as here can you invite please?
---
There you are 😂😂😂
---
I think the plan for Marine Deep Pocketed is just called "Pocketed", so that one might be confusing. IIRC it's at one of the Watoga vendors rather than Grafton.
---
Yes, but you just get dirty water
---
You can put power armor on a chassis and it only takes up 10 weight then.
---
It's still not as useless as a Ghoul Slayer one.  Anyway, just trash every Gamma Gun you come across.  They only have potential in PVP and only against any non-melee build not weaing PA, or that doesn't have a weapon that can 1 shot you.
---
So what's your point? That because it doesn't only mean "rocking back and forth on the floor" it doesn't profoundly effect those elsewhere on the spectrum?
---
Valid point, but counter point; should I stop playing as my BoS member that hates raiders just because he isn't? If he has the tag, how am I to know? 
---
Ohohoho.Thats wat i always like to do.When I feel like takin a break from playin I never quit , i just go hang around inaccesible spots in low level , key locations so players will encounter high level enemies.Sometimes I even change my character from my dupe items mule (lvl90) to my main (lvl 257).
---
Not ideal but I would run it. On a new char I usually try to get Carnivore first so I don't Herbivore, after that I just get as many as I need to get what I want then add class freak. Late game you can start using serums to refine it.
---
They said if they couldn't do it on all platforms they didn't want to do it.  By the time Sony said ok it was too late to put it in the game.
---
Honestly I agree, everyone has a lot of gripes with the game, mine have been laser weapons and scorch beasts, 3 spawned by my camp (didn’t know they could even go there) and destroyed my base with me endlessly dying I log out after 2 deaths log back in (luckily my base was still okay due to metal walls).
---
I log back in my base is just the foundations 
---
The advantage is only available through sheer luck with a miniscule drop rate...  Or buying a weapon from exploiters. Neither option is really appealing in anyway. 
---
I bought it, and I don't regret it at all. I highly recommend it
---
I finally found a quad single action. 10/10. Would reload again... except it's still reloading from last week.
---
A lower level stimpacked me, so waited until the calm and dropped him 10
---
I went to the marsh, then there were nothing but level 8 ticks to find and level 50 scorch beasts
---
At least you can get legendary on it. I'll still waiting for my hunting rifle to start getting the legendary treatment.
---
Erm... I have a pistol build, main is a .44. I kill stuff faster than my rifle friend due to vats/crits build. 
---
"Escape artist" .. use it. RUN, then crouch.
---
Shadowed/Muffled/ultra light gear. Craft the gear you need till you get the mods you want. Leather is cheap as hell to make.
---
I'm just start copying and pasting this all over.
---
I enjoyed the combat of Fallout 4 but I hate collecting junk, crafting and building. So I don't think this game is for me. I enjoy the RPG elements of previous games 
---
Better yet put some kind of storage box like a mail box or something at the Over Seer’s C.A.M.P. that has a good bit of storage weight that we could all deposit weapons, armor and especially plans we don’t need anymore like a community chest of sorts ... I try to leave a bag there of stuff I don’t need but sometimes the bag just disappears when I drop it 
---
The best way to get adhesive is to literally farm it and get the green thumb perk to increase crop yield.
---
Gears and radioactive material are best gotten in PvE battle and scavenging. I never enter PvP with scrap I'm willing to use, and I'd imagine most players are the same.
---
They're supposed to be fake, so...
---
Just because it doesn't 'appeal' to you doesn't mean it doesn't exist. If you want to make a conscious decision to gimp your PvP potential in a PvP-always-on game then that's on you.
---
They need Sony to cross platform as well. Todd directly called out Sony for not agreeing cross platform. 
---
It’d be great to get a “Pay it forward” emote
---
Sulfur water is really good at keeping bugs away though, especially ticks and mosquitoes. 
---
And I got answers and performed tests, as you can see since you checked my post history. Thats how I know. Cant beleive im letting you bait me into responding lmfao, now im acting as immature as you.
---
All the enemies have a max level, but the level they spawn at is based on the region and the level of the player in that zone. For example, the area around Flatwoods is capped at 10ish, so even if a high level player enters the area it won't spawn anything that will completely wreck a low level player. 
---
Get further from the starting area and it becomes more varied. If you went to Blackwater Mine at level 16 it would probably spawn a mix of level 8-20 Mole Miners, but if I went there with my level 90 character it would be filled with level 40 Glowing Mole Miners (that's as high as they go).
---
In your specific cases, there's a good chance that a higher level player had been in that zone recently and caused a bunch of level 40 creatures to spawn.
---
For lead, I usually just make a run of the motel and firehouse gyms. You get something like 170 lead if you grab all the weights from them. Faster than waiting on a lone extractor.
---
The first thing I do when I join a new server is invite EVERYONE I can to my team. Made a few friends that way, too. 
---
I got attacked by a scorchbeast in the beta around level 10 or so. I was going to make it to the pumpkin house come hell or high water. So as soon as I heard the wings flapping and saw it flying my way I knew there was only one option left.
---
I ran, and I got out of its territory.
---
Where abouts? Any directions/pictures please 
---
Well,  congrats on enabling cheaters,  I guess? 
---
At this point, new players should hold off on this shit show anyway. Constant stutter, disconnects daily, lag due to glitch expliters Bethesda lacks the know how to stop. Scorchbeasts stalking low level players. Nuke Zones killing servers. And the aforementioned spawning and leveled enemies crap to top it all off.
---
If someone asked me whether they should buy this now, I would tell them to wait AT LEAST six months, and then carefully reevaluate still. 
---
I just got that same sword. so fun to use. I love the twanging sound the guitar strings makes when it connects with flesh..
---
At what level are you self sufficient? I am level 11 and still flee in terror for my life from most engagements and can't survive the main quest =[
---
Well even if they fix this I'll still be running aroung with my TSE Dragon at the end of dungeons to kill players (even if yhey are not in combat lol) to annoy em and steal their so precious junk.Also for that look on their faces lol.
---
I was doing an event once and stimpacked a higher level, shortly after that I was downed and he started running towards me. I thought my luck was in and he was going to revive me but nope he ate me instead :(
---
That Austin guy from game theory did a vid on how rad-x and rad away would most likely work and it essentially amounts to pooping out the rads so not too far off base.
---
I had to log off ten minutes ago due to this. ITs level 80. I am level 32. I CANT fight it. And I cant sneak away, because it auto tracks. 
---
Wait how does your railway rifle help? Don’t tell me it can be used as a grappling hook or something!? 
---
Thats usually what i end up doing. Theres nothing quite like getting a bunch of good materials and dying only to come flying back immediately after trying to salvage anything you can but alas you end up showing up to an empty paper bag...
---
 I put stuff in that box  on occasion. It would ne nice to just drop it in my own public box.
---
I'd save that congratulations for Bethesda.
---
Yup, that's correct; Destiny's system is not compatible with a game like 76 without completely retooling literally the entire leveling and progression system, aka *the whole damn game.*
---
Maybe a more realistic suggestion would be to level-band regions a bit more granularly so that you don't have wide power swings. If I remember correctly, Savage Divide is levels 15 to 99; they could break the region up into smaller chunks that each fall into narrower level ranges, like 15-25 zone, 25-40, 35-55, 50-70, etc.
---
shady? i mean i torrent stuff i also have hitman pro a vpn custom dns setups, and use more security than needed so think im good, kid, then again what would you know XD
---
They could just tie in the perks to their respective stats. 
---
Lockpicking for Perception
---
Hacking for Intelligence 
---
3 for regular locks/hacks
---
7 for intermediate 
---
12 for master 
---
Yeah always scrap and store just incase. Im always finiding Duct Tape and Wonderglue. Lucky me i found a nice place to CAMP with a refreshing medical cooler and random weapons to scrap. But i always have to go out and farm assaultrons and robobrains for rad mats. Fusion gens are exspensive but hella worth for workshops. 
---
Yes I need that stuff so badly 
---
For anyone saying "Oh, Bethesda employees have the holidays - give them that time off"...
---
... What about the people who bought the game FOR the holidays, expecting to unplug playing, only to find basically they can't play longer than 20 mins without being booted because someone is/was duping something?
---
Those people don't get more holiday days to play do they?
---
I'm amazed a class-action lawsuit hasn't come about for people who can't actually play a game they've spent good money for.
---
Note - it's on cdkeys now for £17.99 - and even the Facebook comments on there say "Not even worth that - unplayable"... There was one that basically said "This game is gash". 
---
I'm not angry anymore, i'm just sorely disappointed. Not played all Christmas because I couldn't do with being disappointed and frustrated even more, spoiling my time off work.
---
I performed "tests" too. Well, if you can call getting one-shotted at the munitions factory a test, "lmfaoxdxd".
---
Oh, I guess it depends on your special points. Still quite impressive to have that damage bonus.
---
Wait, it's in the game world? As in, not a separate cell? Did Bethesda just leave it out on the open or something 
---
When people find out I'm playing this game and ask me how it really is, I always tell them that it will be great when it's finished.
---
Usually Ill drop one on whitesprings for glowing/harden mass, then do what your doing
---
Idk so much about akimbo. It would be cool. But just different types. Like old 1911 style guns. Or other modernish semi auto pistols alongside the revolvers. 
---
Why did you have 1500 mods for the x01?
---
Unfortunately I tried this and the thing kept flapping around with two crippled wings. Video might just be a coincidence. 
---
&gt; hand cannon tier pistols
---
With a proper vats build, they absolutely are.
---
The quest for lead..
---
Charleston Fire Department’s weight room is the best, but it’s often been looted
---
There is a gym in the hotel in Flatwoods with a decent amount of weights
---
There are A LOT of lead veins scattered around the map where you can place a camp. This farms lead for you while your out adventuring. There are also a few located near bodies of water where you can set up a few industrial/regular purifiers for a constant supply of purified waters. 
---
I haven’t personally been to these but there are 4 nodes west of Dyer Chemical and I think most of them have a body of water that’s close enough to the lead vein. 
---
reload screens: the game
---
You sure they were TSE and not just explosive? 
---
Thank you, I had an idea the game was like this but I didn’t want to start making assumptions.
---
lol I was singing that last night after farming a nice *** chameleon R arm
---
Very nice! Did you know if you place a doorframe, you can then snap a second doorframe on the other side, then use r + t to change them both to solid walls, letting you have the inside texture of the walls on both sides (no bricks). Just incase u want to use that.
---
If your aim is terrible I have two suggestions for you. One shotguns. Number 2 my personal favorite Tesla rifles. You can cause a lot of havoc and damage to people with those.
---
They also need level caps on some enemies. Molerates, Radrats, Stags...animals should never exceed Minor Threat status. No matter where they spawn. Its ridiculous that EVERYTHING levels with the player. Its like they didnt learn from Oblivion...and that was 2008.
---
If only I could make it there.
---
Whitesprings is constantly nuked for me.
---
Still bugged.
---
Queen never spawns if you never let the things get to the island.
---
Though maybe that's why no reward, even though it says complete..?
---
Oh it stacks... but if your dead it doesn’t matter. 
---
That moment people on this sub reddit talk like having 1000+ inventory weight is a normal thing and act like they need everything they have or they cant play.... not saying just in these comments but throughout the entire sub reddit.
---
Like I'm over here with 20+ weapons and armor and not even past like 600 (I have the weight reduction perks so it only really adds to like 200) lol then my stash is 400-450 junk then the rest is equipment
---
Well the game IS shit.(Oh wait i hear u cryin."why do you play the gamee iff itss shiit huhhh?" - well to that i answer: I playy it only to fuck and annoy people)And its normal to have so many videos of exploits , it's a Bethesda game.
---
Give yourself to the Helper side, Choose your DesTinEEE
---
Happened for me, except there was actually one Mirelurk just twiddling hid thumbs a solid distance away from the quest area.
---
Repackage as "detox flush" and make $$$$
---
Yeah, sorry, was just joking :)
---
If your keyboard is nearby, use that for PTT! Start the game without controller and bind PTT to a key of your liking. After firing up the controller it still works for PTT. That's how i use it since PTT was introduced for PC.
---
Back in my day we used to just spam "QQ more" until they left.
---
Oh great.Fo76 is so dumbed down even handicapped people play it.Gr8.
---
I gave up on everything Whitesprings. I dont even bother to go there any longer. ITs a complete waste of time. 
---
Bethesda needs to pair people up by level, unless they are intentionally playing with friends. Level 50+ players should not share servers with lower level players. Ever.
---
Make sure you're hitting transfer.  Sometimes it doesn't show if you just click on them. 
---
Otherwise, They have two things that cause this. Weight is capprd (each purifiers can only hold 5) and they share across all purifiers. So if you go above the 60 per hour,  it won't produce more than that with more purifiers.  I think it actually bugs out at that point. 
---
I've got just two of them and they work fine. Producing 5 water every 12 minutes or so. 
---
I actually think it will help crack down on dupers because if they use the vending machines to market their goods..it's going to be obvious if they have 10+ TSE weapons being sold at once. Once you see ridiculous numbers it will be obvious that the person is a duper. Then you can easily get their name, and contact bethesda with a screenshot or something.
---
People may stick to vending with the machines only, which would be monitored and managedm therefore safer, and maybe shun trading with others in person, *hopefully* hitting the duping market.
---
I'm just going off of speculation and a possible scenario, we really dont know until they release it. Hopefully there is some mechanism to promote fair trading and a strong economy.
---
Thanks for the video, very helpful but quick? :)
---
Just used your camp today to craft a Quest item. Thanks for putting it there.
---
no, the t45,t51 and t60 also can get jetpack's, it's just the ultracite that seems to not have it yet :/
---
GT is same. 
---
Should have left his name in so we could have reported his ass.
---
why tho
---
I hope that OP meant 1.5K caps worth of X01 mods lol
---
All guns need a buff. The lack of damage output from guns is frankly pathetic.
---
This isn't how you greentext. lol
---
So now my little brother can play with me :p
---
Have you tried logging out naked then reequipping when you get back in?
---
They implemented a passive mode?
---
I thought it goes away after level five.
---
infinite stash space.
---
Looking to protect yourself, or deal some damage? 
---
I used to do the same but I was sick of things spawning in my bedroom 😥
---
So that's who trained the bats in the art of constant screeching... Either them or one of my ex wives.
---
There is a 20% stackable bonus to your stealth field with Chameleon. The more pieces the harder you are to detect. Also, weight of the armor plays a roll so the best pieces for chameleon are leather. I’ve tested this with all different number of pieces and different types of armor. Leather, CA, and marine. 1-5 pieces except Marine (only have 4)
---
Lol. I didn't think of that. If that's the case that sucks. If not he prolly was a duper and then I say good job Bethesda. 
---
I've got the same format of screenshot (dunno if it's the same place but I tend to stand high and take screens like that alot) but with bits and bobs of T-45 and T-51 PA on a frame instead of this clean Excavator suit.
---
Only have the legs to build for mine so I should have it after farming a few more clipboards for springs at Sugar Grove :p
---
I’ve had multiple people give me drops. 
---
Yesterday while I (LVL30) was doing my rounds of the train stations seeing what they have when a player; mobius05 On PC I think, was just outside shooting up in the air. I ran outside thinking he/she needed help taking down a scorchbeastie. Instead he gives a thumbs up emoji and shoots the paper bag with loot on the ground and they just disappear. I look on the map and mobius was on the other side of the map near some other players. 
---
I like to think that they were just being philanthropist helping the other lower level players. Paying it forward...
---
Oh yeah I get that but i haven’t even had an email saying they’ve received my ticket 
---
Maxed both Gunslinger cards?
---
The problem is that if two people try to take the workshop there’s essentially nothing you can do to stop it unless you can kill someone through slap damage. It’s a fucking stupid system. You shouldn’t be able to hold a pvp point without being pvp flagged. Period. 
---
There should be something that makes low lvl player say oh shit and fear. When I was a low lvl I would run and hide. While not easy, it worked. 100% loved that it felt like the wasteland was dangerous. 
---
except when the pvp does not work at all
---
Heavy/sturdy are prefixes. Ever since I can remember that gets deleted if it has a legendary prefix/suffix or once it’s been modded. Would it be nice? I guess. This is at worst a cosmetic problem. Most people wear clothing to cover up armor anyway. On the list of things that need addressed, this is WAY at the bottom. 
---
No one has the means to do this.
---
And it lasts an hour.
---
Its not a problem for everyone but dupers.
---
That’s incredible and awesome !!!  I feel for you lost my dad a while back and it still stings... we weren’t as close as I am to my kids but I have him thank for that he made me a better dad because he was a great granddad. (Tears)this forum is great!!!
---
Can you please tell me where abouts this is? I’m really struggling to find it 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ac9ftl/is_the_15_less_damage_while_standing_still_mod/?st=JQL9AIL8&amp;sh=0e5678a8
---
It might be a way for Bethesda to find dupers. If they track purchases and sales and see you selling a lot of the same 2 and 3 stars then they've got you. 
---
But I'm guessing you have to be online for people to see your wares which makes sense. I hope it works because it'll be easier to sell stuff, especially for people looking for cheaper legendaries like 1 or 2 stars.
---
Yah take out the assaultrons for scrap to make their helmet.
---
I fucking love Austin
---
I’ll try it out when I get the chance then
---
I dont have a problem with Scorchbeasts but being shot by things completely out of render distance and being tracked indefinitely is annoying af
---
There always a bigger fish. 😎
---
It is not from scrapping your junk, it is from the game automatically scrapping it when you don't have enough materials and you are crafting something that the mod contains the materials you need.  If you have mods on you and choose to scrap all, it won't scrap them.  If you have 2 mods that have 2 leather in each, and you try to craft something that requires 4 leather, and you have 0 leather it will show on the final crafting page before you craft the item that the source for the 4 leather is coming from the 2 mods it is about to scrap.
---
Pretty bad, so make sure to pay close attention when crafting if you like to save mods for later.
---
Except running and hiding doesnt work. I wouldnt mind if it. I agree with your sentiment, I do. But it does not work. Scorchbeasts auto track the player, even when sneaking. 
---
For lower level players, Scorchbeasts are not an enemy. They are a barrier to even being able to play the game AT ALL.
---
Yea that definitely could be the case with the one in my house but the same thing happens with other stations build into the world like white spring bunker etc. 
---
Thanks though, I’ll move the one in my house and mess around some more  
---
Also for armor when you scrap you can learn limb or chest mods regardless of what you scrap. So always build and scrap the cheapest piece.
---
Err why is a level 32 in an area with scorchbeasts is a better quedtion.
---
And why do you think you should be able to hang with them at 32.
---
Enclave: Cieling/Wall Turrets
---
Maybe some of the nice chain linked fences they have inside too. 👌
---
Sorry for your loss 
---
This. Some times it just doesn't show. Hit the transfer button and they'll be there. Industrials should be able to hold 5 each I believe 
---
I have a vast abundance of power armor frames and fusion cores so usually once or twice every time i get online i will sit outaide of vault 76 and wait for new players to exit the vault and as soon as they do there is a frame with 3 fusion cores in it waiting for them. The power armor frames are a GODSEND when you are a very low level.
---
Exactly. 
---
I also told one person that the concept is amazing, but the implementation is...well, Bethesda. Doing what they always do. That was nuff said, I think.
---
More than you, considering I’m not the one with issues on a lower end laptop.
---
Meanwhile one of them could have ressed without going revenge and taken it from you and unless you can kill them with slap damage it’s either stand there until they give up or it’s theres. Very stupid system. 
---
My game crashed and now I can’t get back in due to it being full. Best of luck there everyone, it looked like we were going to get it too! 
---
Agree, and also why it will probably be DLC eventually. Something causes a new path or fissure to open that has stronger enemies or something.
---
How does it not work when I've done it dozens of times? You probably didn't run far enough. 
---
same error for me exactly, i crash everytime in my camp when i try to extract water from the purifier
---
Hey charity can be a nice hobby for a capitalists too!
---
Server hopping vendors, no new info
---
I got your friend req. (Lol) I might not be on for a bit. When do you usually game? 
---
Ugh. I need some stable colbalt flux in the worse way. 
---
I unlocked power armor mods, but I need that stuff and I’m not a high enough level to farm white springs yet. 
---
Is there any other way?
---
I did the same thing, it is so fun 
---
Lol seriously 1000 rifles. Why? Typically I'd say play how you want to play but perhaps Pokemon is would be a better game if you need to keep absolutely everything.
---
I have tried that. And i would not mind an enemy so powerful it makes you flee. Thats cool.
---
The problem is, that you cant flee. And you cant fight. The things auto track, regardless of Stealth use. 
---
As implemented, the Scorchbeast is not an enemy for low level players. Its a technical barrier to even playing at all.
---
not sure, to be honest. I was a lower level when I went there to do it, so I tried and she ended up showing up. 
---
Could just be a bug maybe. Has it happened to other events as well?
---
If it helps, I’ll usually see him around Morgantown Airport or at the Morgantown station
---
I haven't played the game in a couple weeks because two of my main quests have been telling me to go to top of the world, but every time I went there I was massively out leveled by the enemies. I feel like I got those quests at a low level though, is it really just a matter of other players that causing the higher level enemies?
---
I actually asked this same question about a month ago. It does not. Put on super duper and craft the lowest item you can before breaking it down to quickly unlocks mods. Might want to find a list, though. I broke down a few tesla rifles before realizing theres only like 3-4 mods for it.
---
I had a wendigo too
---
What system?  I have a theory.
---
Yeah, good point. Will sell it as soon as my vendors reset.
---
Ohh great idea.thanks
---
He can carry my heavy weapons xD

Bethesda you need to Fix the PVP Trolling. Either create a separate server for PVP, or make it NO affect on passives at all, for us or our camp. I was one shot killed by a Troll while I was on Pacifist.  The guy was cloaked while moving and I never saw him until he one shot me. He was using an abnormally powerful explosive weapon. I suspect he is cheating to do what he did.  
---
Also, this Troll, I refuse to be kind and call them a "Griefer", a Duck is a Duck no matter what you call it, this Troll followed me and my group from server to server. He destroyed my camp several times, each time within seconds, he followed us to a new server and within 5 mins dropped a Nuke on us in an area on the west side of the map, and brought along his pals to help him find us and Troll us. We blocked them and they simply created new accounts to follow us. 
---
Two things here. Pacifist should take NO DAMAGE at all, and The Camp should be on Pacifist if the player is. I don't mind a NPC damaging my camp, but You have created a situation where Trolls and cheaters stalk and destroy camps over and over even if you change servers. I spent over 3 hours gathering resources to make repairs, only to have it all destroyed again. 
---
I am losing faith in Bethesda with this game. I would love to finish the quests that are there with my friends, but cheating Trolls are making it intolerable. 
---
We don't mind playing this game as a Coop and we actually prefer it that way. 
---
If there is no patch that resolves this situation before the DLC drop, I am afraid you will have lost myself and a lot of other Longtime Franchise Gamers. I personally have played over 200 days game time with Fallout 4 alone, not to mention the number of play throughs with Fallout 3 and other Bethesda Titles. This situation needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. 
---
The offending Trolls are as Follows:
---
 DC72  ,  McMickey7749  ,  XIIIIZIIIIX , airbornebacon26
---
I am also on Twitch. Video is available there as well. Caution, the videos may contain harsh language, understandably. 
---
Thank you, and if you need further details, please message me. 
---
I'm level 120 and have been farming for weeks for some decent legendary weapons for my heavy weapons build but I haven't been lucky enough. Very upsetting to see almost every level 60 and higher have amazing weapons that can wreck things that I have to unload so much ammo into haha.
---
 So that's 3 mods or so? I stack up the ones I just pick up and don't really care what happens to them. 
---
 My X0-1 mods get applied at the bunker. ;)
---
When you say "know where to go" where do you suggest? So far I've only been sweeping Morgantown airport occassionally. 
---
I also know of that server hopping thing in Grafton. (I prefer not to server hopping though).
---
What are some other ones you'd suggest?
---
Ok I’ll consult my friend 
---
Preach! 🤗
---
No  problem. You may have to served hop a few times to find a gym that still has the weights, but doesnt take too long.
---
You could probably put stuff in your water purifier, I've never gotten bounty by taking water, I doubt it matters what you take from it. 
---
Lucky Hole mine is a honey hole for lead ore ... my first run through there without really looking super carefully I ended up with over 500 lead scraps after smelting ... you really need to do the mining in Excavator PA to maximize the amount of lead ore you harvest from the mine... the mine is to the SW of Ft. Defiance BTW.
---
Here I was thinking about providing sniper rifles to the new folks. 
---
tl;dr Grafton station has deep-pocketed plans server hop to get em (the other vendor in grafton often has BOS plans so do them at the same time if you need em)
---
Basically, it spawns on radiance so if a high level runs through, just a nice streak of level batshit enemies
---
I'm not sure exactly how it works because it depends on how it all breaks down.
---
**This is just an example, I have zero idea what the actual formula is.**
---
Let's say you deal 1000 damage unmitigated and your target has 250 damage resistance.
---
If it's just your damage minus their defense then you'd deal 750 damage to that target. (1000-250)
---
(1000-250) **Base damage minus resistance**: 750
---
(750 x 0.25) **Apply Sentinel effect**: 187.5
---
(187.5 x 0.7) **Apply Dodgy effect**: 131.25
---
(131.25 x 0.75) **Apply Empath effect without Strange in Numbers**: 98.43
---
(1.31.25 x 0.6875) **Apply Empath effect with 1 Strange in Numbers**: 90.23
---
So your damage in this case is reduced by nearly 90% if DR is calculated first. If DR is calculated afterwards then you would have damage immunity to that. 
---
But I'm pretty sure the damage formula is at least based off of the one in Fallout 4. So damage calculation is based on weapon damage relative to your DR. I still don't know if your DR applies before or after the extra effects though.
---
Remember to use each other to give items to alts for essentially infinite stash space.
---
They'd have to sell the game on the microsoft store and lose a cut of whey sale for something only a minority would want.
---
You're wondering why a business didn't choose to lose money
---
I'm running Sneak level 3, 5 pieces of Shadowed Chameleon Legendary Armor + Evasive. Never get detected. Mobs run over from where the shots originate and stare into nothingness. With Evasive giving me that extra utility of being able to relocate and drop back into stealth whenever I want.
---
What I want to know is...how does the stealth effect stack up in comparison to chameleon and is there a point where you can drop the sneak peek card in favor of more damage 🤔
---
Honestly that's a really good point I didn't think about at all. That does fit alot better. 
---
Same.  If anything I wonder if he was in pacifist, then did something to unflag himself (hit a wanted player, steal from a camp, accidental hit) and didn't reflag himself.
---
I really hope Bethesda will see this
---
Why hide their name? Call them out and report them.
---
from experience the more you add to a pool the more variation youll get between purifiers
---
 Killed my first at level 30.

---
I hate it more when they nuke the train station as well instead of moving the circle a half inch to the left so there's an easy fast travel. 
---
Not if he's on a team. If his team has empath it reduces the damage he takes. If you take the serum to suppress the negatives, have a full team of empaths, and use strange in numbers you become pretty much immune to damage. I do this  with only 1-2 empaths on my team to do queen with a low life build and it's pretty outstanding
---
The mobs won’t scale up into the 50’s in that zone, IE: Outside vault 76, and Flatwood area.
---
Because they can
---
*Cries with yo-*
---
"*Disconnected from Server*"
---
The patch notes also said they fixed the problem with the game crashing after you exit to desktop, but mine still does every time :(
---
It helps if you're near Whitesprings, or that [surface-to-air missile system](/spoiler) in the Cranberry Bog. Then you just tag it with a shot and try to stay out of the way. At level 30 now, I think I've gotten credit for 3-4 scorch beasts without other players. I'm not sure about the 4th because I accidentally hit a robot and had to run.
---
Anywhere else I try to run away and get indoors.
---
Ugh so many guns are bugged it is truly astounding. 
---
With Green Thumb the other day,  I farmed up like 200 fluorescent flux in about 10 minutes. 
---
Probably at the spa in the main building
---
While you don't mind doing that. You do lose out of damage … period. Problem, TSE. It' makes the game beyond pointless to play because only 2 things won't instantly die to it and they both fly. It also allows for builds that can be a jack and master of none because all that is truly needed is Demolition Expert and MAYBE grenadier.
---
I hope they remove the explosive effect from TS weapons and remove the perks effecting it. 
---
They ruin events and the game in general.
---
I just went through my stash and emptied out a bunch of mats I clearly wasnt using, tossed them in a suitcase, logged onto my newly created alt and they now have a bunch of base building material. spared like 200 pounds, and it still hasnt made a different to my first character (although im running terribly low on screws).
---
I agree, the inventory management system is only as complicated as people make it. It's too easy to find the junk you need and avoid what you don't. People just want the game to do everything for them so they can mindlessly play, then complain that the game is mindlessly easy. It's a survival game, there's no logistical reason to have hundreds and hundreds of pounds of crap on you. food, water, aid and a very select few weapons...all you need to SURVIVE
---
Not at all, fortnite does exactly what I'm suggesting.  They use their own launcher on PC like FO76 does.  And I'm pretty sure Fortnite has made money hand over fist

How many of atoms?

Is your character sleeping with ghouls? FO4's BOS hinted to us about the dangers of nuclear STDs.
---
 They are fun. You are looking at this wrong. ;)
---
Valid point lol 
---
Yeah. It just feels lame sometimes. I want to see a deathclaw or super mutants and be scared, not meh.
---
Well that explains why the dupers are now making tons of bobbleheads and magazines.  
---
In regards to OP, I am near top of the world pretty often for a few reasons. Pleasant valley ski resort and the train station ate right next to one another. That's 2 vendors in 1 area. Gotta see what they both have to sell. Also there is a very easy path though the area to collect 81 lead and 162 steel in less than 1 minute. Also in that same area I know where a plans spawn is as well as a bobble head spawn. So I check there 2 to 3 times a play session. It's also only a 2 cap fast travel from my camp and it's the nearest vendor. I dont think people are doing it to intentionally not allow you to progress, it's just a damn good area that level scales.
---
Learn something new! Will try next level.
---
Post it! Do it now! Please. :)
---
You have to get both wasteland whisper and animal friend perk cards in charisma to level three. You need to be level 50 to unlock wasteland whisperer. 
---
Then you have to find a random spawn animal that’s half your level. So If your level 50 gotta tame a level 25 or bellow. 
---
Then you have the find the animal in a random spawn. Not a set spawn like deathclaw island. 
---
Here is a few good places to look for deathclaws 
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/QdQxaNz
---
I've managed to run away, hide and sneak my way out of fighting scorch beasts. Only just got to lvl 50 so not tried to kill one yet. To my mind they are exactly what the dragons of Skyrim should have been. Hard AF and lethal. 
---
I never decloak from firing my silenced automatic handmade rifle. Sounds like a bug or not realizing you are moving 🤔
---
I don't think it lets you transfer items into the resource collectors/purifiers etc. 
---
Can’t tame that one because that’s a set spawn. Like the deathclaw will spawn there no matter what so you can’t tame that. Has to be a random encounter 
---
Ya these people are cowards. Come out and face me. I’ll not try to use up all my ammo on your level 20 that only takes slap damage but can somehow still hold a point...
---
The SPECIAL changes only affect your stats. So if you lose 3 st, you lose out on 3 strength's worth of melee damage and 15 carry capacity. It does not lower the amount of strength perks you can use. 
---
I'd say to just go for it to test them all out, you'll most likely lose them anyway. Maintaining mutations at a low level is unrealistic. You need A) the recipes and flux to make serums yourself, B) a decontamination arch and source of high radiation at your camp to farm them quickly and safely, or C) enough money to keep buying serums. Decontamination arch plans and serum recipes are both very rare and (in the serum's case) obscenely expensive. Buying serums is still rather costly from players, but extremely expensive from the whitesprings bunker. You pretty much need to get to a high level for it to be a viable possibility. Until then, mutations are just "you get what you get"
---
Inquiry: how does one get the photos taken in game onto a device that can share it? I got some awesome ass photos ive been wanting to share but not sure how
---
That's sucks. I need to farm some aluminum to craft mine now that I got  full set of plans (sans helmet, which doesn't give DR anyway, so I can just use a T51b helmet for now). 
---
They’re gonna find ya, they’re gonna get ya get ya get ya get ya

I see the reason to run around the area, I just hate how the enemies that spawn around there usually evolve into the deadliest thing on earth

---
Does anyone know which Excavator piece provides the extra 100 carry capacity this power armor provides? (not talking calibrated shocks mods.)
---
I am wondering if you had Excavator torso and arms with T60 legs attached with calibrated shocks, if would it provide the same carry capacity as full Excavator Power Armor with Excavator legs with Power Armor calibrated shocks?
---
Lmao I wonder if thats the guy i fought on the golf course. 
---
Anyways, thanks for this. I guess assassins and  sentinel can both be on the same armour.
---
I will now begin to create an invincible character of my own!
---
Still doesn’t make sense that you still take damage at +100% damage reduced but I guess this will be a long running thing. Seems you can break 100 without a team even, so i am excited to see what the next couple weeks brings!
---
Thanks again for linking the post man, happy trails!
---
My husband and I were talking about how nice everyone has been yesterday. We're both still under 20 (he get distracted by workshops, and I love wandering), but we're finally to the point where we can drop off extra ammo, plans, recipes, etc. I hope this pay it forward mindset sticks.

I run a pistol vats crit build in PA- lvl 56 -  with no TSE weapons (IMO they break the game) and I am enjoying the ride.  3 points in concetrated fire and all the luck perks make for some amazing headshot vats action.  
---
I agree tho, please add some more ballistic pistols....like the ones from FONV.  Also, I've been buying the laser perk cards.  I'm going to start playing with them soon too, which should increase the amount of pistols in my arsenal.
---
My build-. It's not a min max build.  It's a maximizing AP and AP Regen, carry a ton of junk and food and cores and play for days without having to camp/ vendor.  https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=96248ed&amp;d=sb2sa2sg2p02pb2c72ic1i12a72a80s72ad2ak0al0a00a30l22lr2l12lk2lv0ek1s12&amp;w=&amp;n=Gunslinger
---
Can’t tame that one it’s a set spawn. You can only tame an animal that’s a random encounter 
---
Such a waste, I almost bought Atoms when I saw it was limited but then I looked more closely at the actual paint job on it and it’s tacky. 
---
Nothing like the Atom Cats paintjobs which is depressing, I wasn’t expecting replicas but something with a similar style or effort would have been nice. 
---
The colours are way too bright 
---
I have too many disease cures as that's all I seem to get from the meds search perk. Handy to know there's something for those who don't keep finding their own body weight in cures every play through. 
---
I think both are terrible lol....that's just imo tho
---
I know it's used for armor piercing mods as well. 
---
Good job everyone! 
---
I think think a duper is going to come in here and be like "Do you know what, your right, I'm going to stop duping now". Hopefully Bethesda will hear the cries........ 
---
like my camp being permanently over budget 
---
Thank you for that.  MFT.  Got it. Like it.
---
That’s pacify. Tame makes them become a pet in your base. But pacify never lasts forever on any animal 
---
My friends and i were on a whitesprings nuke run, girl runnin with us found 4 x 2 shot weapons in about 30 minutes, i was at the whitesprings golf store and got a 2 shot handmade as a drop night before last..
---
If your desperate for a 2shot. Handmades on the fo76bazaar sell for 1800-2000 caps.. 3-5k for tse handmades.
---
Hate to break it to you but The fallout 4 brotherhood is more like classic fallout brotherhood. They typically are xenophobic dicks. Fallout 3 BoS are the outliers. 
---
Yeah, this is such a good spot for so many reasons.  I kept my camp at the junk deposit accross the road for quite a while, until other people figured out how good it was and started putting their camps there.
---
Definitely. The power plants are the only workshops that give you generator plans, for instance.
---
That would be stupid as I have over 15 tse weapons of all variety, I'm a merchant, and I was told that all the weapons where obtained legitimately. I don't support duping as it hurts the economy and most of the weapons I have I can't sell for more than I bought them. 
---
Where did you hear about this?
---
And this is why I stopped playing and am waiting until I can actually rack up proper hours on it. The game actually crashed the first time I left the Vault on Christmas Day (after waiting for a 50GB download!)... And then disconnected after I got to Morgantown... Stopped playing after that because I lost patience (and I actually wanted to enjoy my Christmas hahaha!)
---
I threw an artillery grenade at someone’s camp just to see if the cannon could reach that far, sometimes it’s not at nefarious as you might think 
---
It can’t be a deathclaw on deathclaw island has to be a random encounter spawn. 
---
I’m not a duper. I meant caps lol. Who the hell would actually have 1,500 mods of x-01 gear? That’s crazy.
---
I know you're pain. Anytime I'm there I check the map to see if there is anyone else there, and to fast travel there, 2 birds 1 stone kind of thing. And if there is, I just kill everything so they can get through with out trying to fight level 68 super mutants at level 22.
---
Although I just realized that you can get the Chameleon and Sneak legendary effect on the same piece of armor. I have one of those 😅
---
Oh, no. He clicked my Xbox profile and messaged me. I find it funny how he didn’t bother attacking my brother. Only me. He had even sent him the message of how he was under investigation too
---
Think it’s 700 for a few more hours but can’t see the price now that I own it
---
I don't think there is a performance difference when you got bugs and all the other issues that come with this game. 
---
See here’s the thing, I’m not looking for recognition for helping them, I want to make sure they get the items before 1. I disconnect and the bag despawns, and 2. Before a higher level casually strolls by and empties the cache thinking “oh hell, free stuff!”
---
Really?  Huh.  I need to go do one of those workshops then.  
---
Damn im away :( alright thanks
---
You can turn it back on, i think its been there since the beginning 
---
Fortnite is the exception, not the rule. Its f2p as well so the devs lost nothing selling it on every platform possible.
---
Now if fo76 was f2p and microtransaction driven i could see it being possible but that's not the case.
---
Totally agree 
---
I don’t know why any one would dupe or only play with TES. It just ruins the fun of the game. 
---
Just take some Rad-aways and a weapon lol. Long as you get in at least 1 hit on enemies you’ll get exp and loot from it. And yes, you can go in any nuke, doesn’t have to be yours 
---
No there is a pacifist mode. Goto map and into game settings, default is off, you can turn it on so ya dont hurt anyone if you shoot in their direction and hit them accidently.
---
Thanks. Ran the repair tool and that seemed to resolve the issue.
---
Much appreciated. 
---
You can play solo as well. You just periodically see other users online. You can isolate yourself as much or easily join a team.
---
You kept falling out of chi, preventing you from realizing! ;)
---
would it scrap my weapons and power armor frames on its own too? cause that’s the majority that was missing from my stash 
---
Just regular PA, some rad-x, rad away and an ability to tag monsters. 
---
Travel with a team, use perk cards to gain extra experience for that. Get a few shots into the big guys you see getting taken down whether it’s you’re right or not, you will gain XP from that too. Having a good sniper rifle helps for this if you are true filth. 
---
Do the main quest stuff don’t just rely on exploring randomly. Do the challenges also. They help you explore the world and you are rewarded in atomic points and I believe also XP. 
---
But yes as others said, “punching above your weight” helps, which is why travelling in a team helps.
---
They said next update they will set it back to 400
---
Mostly from dupers at this point.
---
I farmed for close to 100 hours and i got 1 explosive pump shotgun.
---
There's 7 vendor "factions" you can sell to, for a max of 1,400 caps per day.
---
Here's a color coded map of them all:
---

---
Its always 100% of the time that nefarious. Point and case: You threw the grenade at another players base 'just to see if the cannon could reach' instead of literally anywhere else on the map where a player hasnt placed their base.
---
* serendipity doesn't work in PA
---
* ghoulish works much better for sustain over life giver
---
* if you don't have class freak maxed you need it
---
* use fix it good to increase your resistance significantly
---
* use psychobuff
---
* Grab dodgy, rejuvenated and supressor to increase your sustain
---
They boost player count numbers and time, which is what C level executives care about.
---
Also they might buy stuff from the atom store.
---
They don't add value to you, it's pretty easy to see how they add value to the companies metrics.
---
ebay
---
next step for you is get to lvl 50 and find lvl 50 guns
---
rngesus
---
No news.
---
Imo the expanded stash was in error anyways as if your stash is full things get more unstable.
---
I've ran at 450/600 for ages and i dc once in a blue moon.
---
Mostly trading. By level 153, I've only found one so far, and it's a level 35 dragon. The ones you buy from players are likely but not always duped though. 
---
I'm impressed with your knowledge of poop!
---
I have to disagree.
---
Grab the junk piles at the raceway, the Charleston dump, use the one by the west river in CAMP, and in a few hours I was making pieces of Excavator armour.
---
We will end up with a strip mall.  Armor, weapons.  Now we need a restaurant, and a pharmacy.
---
Wait did they really?
---
as it stands there is no 'in game' economy, just npc vendors with a small daily cap limit whose prices are not influenced by the community/playerbase, there is no such thing as player vendors yet, that 'economy' exist entirely on third party websites like this one
---
The original increase to 600 said it was only testing the waters, and if they could increase it further and maintain server stability, they probably would.
---
Maybe the capture points need a cool down of sorts?
---
I think more people should know about this.
---
Ad Victoriam my ass.
---
On the flip side, if you are level 100 whatnot and want to gift me a super rifle and stimpacks and whatever else you want to give away, please dont, I have multiply characters and I rather just "discover" the game myself instead of getting the best gear at the beginning, that will just ruin the game for me. Thank you for your understanding.
---
It’s on the front page 
---
I like them as this big oppressive monster that you have to just hide from early on. But will admit they can be annoying. I really hope they do seasons in Fallout 76. I hope eventually they do a big update and we beat the scorchbeasts and they are more or less gone from the world replaced with a new threat maybe even some oppressive raider group moving into the area now that scorchbeast are gone. Remnants Scorchbeast would still show up as very rare spawns but for the most part they would be gone. 
---
You can't fast travel into a nuke zone. Look for a place on the edge of the nuke radius an FT there.
---
All you need in a nuke zone is radiation protection (Hazmat / PA + RadEx) and  - if you're in the lower levels - a ranged weapon. Shoot at everthing that moves (be sure to have pacifist mode enabled!) and you will get the XP and can loot the bodies if someone else kills it.
---
Yeah i put passive mode on so i can shoot and not worry about killing players when fighting the Queen.
---
Stops any griefing too if your not in the mood for PvP :)
---
i know, i barely use it and i could use those 10 weight
---
i rarely use power armor anyway and when i do its my x0-1 set
---
I'm afraid I don't remember. But it's up to you. You can follow the steps or go right away. It doesn't matter much in the end.  
---
But if you like questing, I'd suggest following the main quest order, because after that, you're pretty much done.
---
I’ll do the shoot other peoples kills in nuke zones 
---
If he goes to Whitespring when there are groups or a nuke he'll get all sorts of great random stuff farming the ghouls/diseased, etc.
---
It's not necessary to hit the hard spots to get good equipment.  
---
His reasoning doesn't matter. The point is, a lvl 11 shouldn't have to progress through hordes of lvl 68 enemies. And that crap is very common as soon as you leave the Forest and the only solution is to server hop and hope for the best.
---
I use a super sledge and clean up the ground mobs till she lands then smack her :)
---
How do you get the photos in game onto here? I got some photos i took in game i want to share that are bad ass
---
Don’t say “probably at the spa”
---
If you don’t know then you don’t know so don’t bother answering.
---
You don't need tse to kill efficiently, or even explosive for that matter. Ive had more fun playing a character without trading.
---
personal must haves 
---
For weapons
---
-Pretty much whatever your perk points have gone to. I use a TSE pump but to each their own
---
For apparel 
---
-Hazmat suit with **good** legendary armor underneath, this is definitely the best way to go if you want to reduce rad intake while still not dying from one ghoul.
---
-Power Armor (recommend Excavator if you plan on carrying a lot, otherwise T-60, X-01 and Ultracite will do you just fine) for some of the best defense ratings possible (in the case of Excavator it’s more suited for utility)
---
For aid 
---
-Radaway
---
-Rad-X/RadShield
---
-Stims
---
-Chems if you frequent them
---
-A lot of water, especially if you run through chems and aid
---
-food just Incase 
---
I just tag the things with screws (and other stuff I need) and grab them when I pass by an object with a magnifying glass, by skipping everything else, I’m not only saving a ton of time and weight, but I don’t have to stop and go do something tedious to get the screws. Nor do I have to go find a workbench to scrap constantly, like if I had picked up everything I saw. They just accumulate as I play. The time investment is negligible, and I don’t waste a bunch of time elsewhere. It’s a net gain. 
---
Ok mate thanks for the help I like questing and I like getting to the top ie. the enclave so I’m just kinda stuck ig 
---
Ya I’ll be on in like 10 min tho. add yung_bert no mic btw 
---
Goto gulf club you'll be 50 in no time
---
There's a big round structure with stone columns by the golf course buildings - it's pretty hard to miss. The actual drinking fountain is pretty easy to miss - it's inside the structure along the perimeter wall.
---
No way
---
I found a place called Deathclaw Island on the west side of the map. Just look NW at the big river and there is an island in the river. Go to that island and walk around, about in the center a level 21 deathclaw spawned for me.
---
Lol so I heard
---
There is no point in waiting. I doubt Bethesda can fix anything, just patch. I think we will see server disconnects and choppy frame rate from here on and I enjoy the game but its really is the worst online experience I've had. 
---
&gt;  I said something in the heat of the moment on Reddit
---
I'm willing to speculate you simply said what was going through your head and didn't want to own it.
---
One of my favorite weapons thusfar is a level 45 2shot handmade...that was in a paper bag. Someone threw that out...
---
Imo they are in the mindset of being a depressing person that shows devs how bad their game is by exploiting.
---
Ironucally in this game they are literally the problem for the instabilities.
---
I edited the last reply with some stuff. I wanna stress some more that it's just a guess on my part but hopefully it helps.
---
Fallout 76 is not a relaxing experience hahaha.
---
I finally encountered legendaries while wandering around by myself. 
---
For quite a while there was nothing. Then a drone showed up and all the robots began firing at it. I think that to trigger legendaries, something has to happen that gets all the robots engaged in combat. 
---
Hopefully some PS4 guys will add you :)
---
The terrain makes it one of the worst for that, you might try bulldozing as much of the bs as possible. There’s at least one hidden safe to check iric. I’ve moved east since but I know the spot pretty well.
---
Me apologies for thinking you might be 1 of THEM. My thought exactly on it ruining the game.
---
Online gaming is how my brothers and I, who all live hours apart now, keep in touch. My father can barely handle his phone, so I don't think this is an option for us, but that's really cool for you guys!
---
The saying "It's about the journey, not the destination" probably rings hollow for you right now.
---
I wouldn't believe that without seeing a source.
---
You can rack up xp pretty easily if there are others there. Just go over towards the clubhouse entrance by the tennis court. As you face the front door, go over to the left. There’s a ledge there. If you stand on that ledge and shoot from there,  the ghouls have trouble reaching you and you can pile up xp as long as ghouls make it outside. 
---
it sounded like it does complete for many people though and doesn't if you get them in the wrong order (apparently I didn't get the memo that I was supposed to explore in a certain order)
---
Ouch. You ok man? I seem to have hit a nerve. Maybe you’d like to discuss why this makes you so emotional? Is there some reason you’re so emotionally tied to this? Sorry if I upset you. 
---
I play Eve online and find this whole complaining about pvp situation rather hilarious
---
No one's saying don't use the tag system in favour of just Junk piles at workshops.  The workshops aren't tedious, it's literally 60-120 seconds to fast travel grab the stuff you want, dump the rest and go about your business.
---
Give people more options, rather than trying to tell them one thing.
---
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
---
Most people are far from satly because they don't have one. That's just some bullshit to say as some sort of "im a big man" justification for endorsing such a out of control weapon thanks to all the exploiting done, how many are out there, how many people have them and what's more .. how many people use them in events where there are groups of people trying to do the event too.
---
The weapons are broken, need to be removed or fixed and just because you're happy being a dick in game and ruining the experience for others {Or not but the tone of your post} doesn't mean everyone else is salty, that is such a juvenile argument.
---
That sounds like something someone who is waiting for you to get into melee range would say...
---
Duck's sporting goods
---
The engine was originally called "NetImmerse" which just smacks of single player only, doesn't it?
---
I believe I already explained why having a chance to get less cards isn’t optimal. Either way it’s perceived as a bug, but I think the current method is equally perceived as a bug and/or just bad luck. At least one partially conveys what I believe the game mechanic is. 
---
With all these random chance things, the solution is always to extend tries to re-roll the chance. The mechanic is not about the best way to get additional tries (ex: the best way to gain a level so as to get the perk pack you want, or kill a legendary in just the right way that they drop god rolled weapons/armor), but find ways to make accomplishment of the trials. In the case of farming legendaries, that means the most efficient way to killer more legendaries monsters in less time. In the case of perk packs, the most efficient way to gain levels (power level). The solution is simply to just play the game. I kind of like that solution because I kind of just like the game.  
---
As for your gate keeping accusations... I mean, I sell serums on the marketplace for a 10th of market value just because I believe everyone should have access to the mutations. If I’m gate keeping, 1) I’m doing it by supporting something I really have no say so or control over. I can’t influence basal game mechanics 2) why do I bother helping other players?
---
Tbh I think some mechanics that artificially extend game play make sense because the bulk of my leveling happened before XP and legendary drop Chance was nerfed. Others, like resource nerfing, make no sense and do not facilitate a better playing experience. Imo, part of the joy of playing is that your building your character through earned rewards. If you shower the player with too many rewards, that ceiling just gets a little closer. Most players can’t find ways to keep themselves entertained after they’ve hit the ceiling. It’s probably in the game’s interest to work this way
---
So you made up 18k in couple of weeks? What’s your main source?
---
Honestly, laming in nuke zones is about the only efficient way at our level. Dawn some power armor with melee perk cards and whack away at ghouls at Whitesprings whenever a nuke touches down. Note that after level 50 or so there isn’t a huge huge advantage to leveling up much except for accumulating perks or moving points around, currently weapons/armor cap at 50 and your damage does not scale beyond that point.
---
Anime is cartoons. Debate me
---
Is there a way to track where grahm is? Ive only come across him 2 times in my play through, level 52
---
Hi death, I'm dad
---
People must live in pretty crappy areas or something. Very seldomly do I get any disconnects or have server issues.  
---
Maybe us Canadians aren't assholes.
---
Lol I'm wandering around now trying to find it. 
---
Is it:  Go to prime nuked, turn on flashlight, look under all the regular trees for purple flash ferns?
---
Using greenthumb you can easily pull 60 doing that I find.
---
I am not for this, with the caps cap, the weight cap, the vendors caps cap limit, I get a lot of stuff, and I put it on my mules. Materials, weapons form 2-3 star legionaries. If it was not for my mules, I would lose a ton of the stuff I spent hours farming or trading for. Want to kill how many people are playing now, do that and take away their countless hours of farming materials and amazing loot into the void. 
---
Just craft it it’s so easy , I was actually shocked it didn’t require some unobtainable ingredient unlike the goddam water filter !! Lol,  seriously steel, lead and gunpowder- scrap weapons for steel , kill super mutants for gunpowder and destroy protectrons for lead. Viola!! All the ammo you can carry.
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the info
---
Shitting in our nappy is our first creative act as humans. Know thyself.
---
Farming whitesprings nuked is the best way to get xp, guns, and armor tbh. Your best bet is to launch that nuke 
---
Can you make a video showcasing your camp?
---
New player here. I keep reading stories about everyone helping and giving stuff away and not being stomped on but the exact opposite has happened to me. Never been helped. Never encountered ANYONE willing to do anything and never been giving a damn thing.
---
The giving me stuff, whatever, thats fine, because you dont have to. But the helping hand, at the very least, point me to the right direction, not one time and I've asked plenty.
---
I dont know if these stories are too far and in between in game or they're just made up. But I have yet to encounter anything like what anyone has posted about.
---
I'm 54, my son is 17.. He's just not into fallout the way I am.   I'm pretty sure he'd roll with me if I asked him to,  but I'd feel bad taking him away from his friends. 
---
They are playing Divinity Original Sin 2, so at least he's forsaken me for a really good game lol.
---
Congrats for dodging the downvotes to hell. Don't know how you did it since I've seen more worthwhile posts whither and die but more power to you.
---
Guy Fieri *heavy breathing*
---
Why not?
---
400 is more than enough space if you are actually using the things in your stash. 600 is nice, and any increases after that there should be no reason as to why people have storage issues.
---
That is true, with weapon holstered who’s to know lol.
---
That’s poo. 
---
&gt; that was bethesda's reason back in beta. 
---
Again, I've yet to see anyone link to something that shows that.
---
I'm really not trying to be pedantic here, seriously. I've just tried to find any sort of definitive or even semi-official statement from Bethesda and have come up with nothing, at least other than "well my friend heard from a guy that Bethesda said it on their forum" with no goddamn forum link to back that up. At this point it's maddening.
---
Be careful with that roleplay talk, some people won't believe you because you arent roleplaying their way. Do it man, this game needs more role playing.
---
This is true, but you get more health when you level up, and thus, more power.  This is the main reason I need to level up.
---
That's kinda what I was thinking
---
Ghoulish and melee perks in a nuke zone makes things way too easy.
---
I am interested! You doing it in the Cranberry Bog?
---
Can you just log out and get a different instance in that scenario?
---
Thank you, I'll scour every front porch I can in the area!
---
What platform? 
---
I didnt ask you to prioritize my suggestion, but thank you.
---
I am not most people, so i dont particularly care what you or any other person does.
---
Decent people are decent. I wouldn't say it's more than that but good to hear that there are still plenty of us out there :)
---
If that was you, thanks!  I saw a bag in the first overseer camp and in it was a decked out level 5 BoS recon rifle was in it. 😀
---
What? So you didn’t buy it because it reminded you of Hot Wheels?
---
Ah I see, I tried 
---
you fire the spike into a wall then if you can hit the same railway spike with another it pokes out and you can jump on them like a ledge, can get to a number of places you werent intended to this way
---
Don't see another thread, posting here for +karma swap
---
I'm playing on a PS4 Slim and nuked Whitesprings yesterday. We had a good 4 hours session going. My team mates would get a Blue screen but no server disconnects. We had a lot of fun. I run via Wifi my stash is maxed and so was i for the last 2 hours. Just to compare.
---
I have a Auto Grenade Launcher as well with a armor piercing effect on it but it's named as a normal Auto Grenade Launcher.
---
PvP in this game as of right now is basically nonexistent and lots of players are bored so this is what the resort to. I can't imagine Bethesda thought it would be "cool" to have everyone build up cool camps just to have one dude blow them all up "for dat bounty."
---
How hard is it?  When I launched my nuke, 5 people were there and 2 left, and it was only me and 3 others and it has made me avoid the silos due to the difficulty.
---
Reminds me of mr fluffy ay miguels camp
---
Excellent idea. I can only imagine what the raiders would come up with shield wise. Spikes and shit 
---
Another one of these posts about helping... alright. Great. 
---
Got a lot of steel to shape...
---
Hmm maybe? I know mine never completed nor did my friends.
---
Possibly a bug both ways tbh. Ie it shouldn't complete and or it should
---
What point are you making?  So the game shouldn't be fixed and we can all be fucked?
---
only place ive found him was in big bend tunnels
---
Other than the sneaking (too slow for me) I 100% agree with this method
---
It would give an incentive to one handers.
---
Preach it !! I feel you ,I’m throwing away so much stuff it’s painful !!! I was over encumbered  for a month!!!Something better needs to be implemented.
---
I’ve never said don’t take workshops. I take them often. It’s a fun part of the game with lots of rewards. Where are you getting that I said don’t take workshops? When did I say “you have to only get items by tagging them and you have no other options”? Also, why are you getting so upset about it? I’m talking about a dude who asked for scrap because he doesn’t have any and then admits the only way he tries to get it is by orbital striking other people. And honestly, I was just poking the bear because, if he’s been doing that, he’s obviously been ruining some people’s days. It’s just some jabs at a guy robbing other characters in game because it’s funny to see the tables turned. 
---
bethesda man bad
---
Now you’re talkin’!
---
Ayyy glad to hear it buddy! I had a similar problem when I first installed the game but my issue was with grass flickering like crazy, happy to hear it helped, happy gaming, bro!
---
I wonder if this is just a "bug" for the AGL that negates any prefix from the name.
---
But how do you fix the garbage of humanity that chose to exploit this? It's a shared issue. On the Devs and the player base. When glitches and exploits pop up, YT clickbaiters will use it for traffic, players will use it for personal gains. 
---
Personally, I still don't have a TSE. Haven't found one, but I have found a group of supers all wearing giant clown heads and had a camp called Gun Runners. I still don't get what the end game is for duping anyways. To get caps? 
---
I am having the same problem, as I had used a two monitor setup and then switched to a single monitor setup. I think this may be the cause of the problem. Which display settings did you change and where?
---
Workaround If you’re on Xbox:  go to Friends-Recent-pick a recent player and join game.   Don’t know if other platforms have similar. 
---
Duuuude, I'm right there with you.
---
Played 6+ hours yesterday without a hitch
---
If youre on ps4 look me up: Silune
---
Dont mind helping people through mayor for a day.
---
Maybe you arent an asshole but what you just said it pretty naive.
---
To busy artillery'n the ghoul building...
---
Cuz TITIES
---
Thanks, that changes things a bit... I'll put either Lone Wanderer or Action back in, they  don't really stack well together. I'll keep a look out for Core Assembly, but I don't think I've ever seen one. T60 Kinetic pops up quite a bit, at least.

Wow! I  had a feeling that this type of game play was going on, it is kind of childish! I am a level 151,  but I  have put my time in over the last two months close to 250 hours in total. 0I give support and supplies to other players all the time, for free including legendary weapons. What's the point of being selfish. I don't even like killing others in the game unless you are  wanted or it is by accident. I may be the loan wonder and antisocial at times. But I try to be a good player. I am getting tired of nuking an area and these same players seem to be the ones that have been mentioned in this thread, and they try and bully and manipulate the nuke zone and I end up kicked off of my own nuke zone, when the server crashes. I think that Bethesda needs to review and hold these players accountable. Put automatic warrants for a high price on their heads to drain there resources and show their camp area as well on the map so it can be nuked. School these brats right out of the game. If anyone comes across me in the game come and say hello, @ MendedMantis1 please keep in mind  my head set is down till next week, and I am slightly anti social, my player is socially awkward lol. I  will be there to help you out if you're in a jam and if you have any issues with another player because of bullying or someone other issues mentioned in this thread. I will become the  bully hunter and set these ass holes straight. Well I wish everyone the best. Hope to see you all in the wasteland soon. Kindest regards Jay Bird.

You realize I'm not OP, you're asking him if he feels like a "big man" for engaging in PvP, and you're asking *me* if I'm butthurt? If there was a projection subreddit, this comment would be in the community info.
---
You don't get more health. 
---
The only thing after 50 is drops and an optimized build
---
Get 4, and the GOTY edition, since the DLCs add a lot of new base building items.
---
You'll have to go new and sealed or digital if you're on console, because the DLC is a one-time-use code that comes with it.
---
Sorry for your loss but the memory will last you forever that’s awesome!!!
---
"I'm a big man"?  What?  Are we even talking about this guy using a TSE himself, or are we letting our emotions and anger about assholes using TSE in events leak all over the topic?  I never once commented on that, and not only are you flat out wrong in your bold assertion that i'm one of those jerks using TSE in events, but I give away stimpacks, ballistic fiber and other stuff to new players almost daily.  I love that you will just rip me apart on the forum with this weird image you've conjured when I just finished helping a level 10 and 11 take the junk yard and defend it using only my mutation AoE's to keep aggro while they killed.  It's terrible.
---
If you want people at endgame to stop endorsing TSE as a good weapon, then fix the massive bullet sponge issues the Queen presents when *new* players show up to the queen and don't get a kill.  They do with me because I roll with friends and know to use the endangerol syringer to bring her resistances back down a bit - and because we use TSE weapons when fighting her.
---
So you want to attack me for telling the guy to enjoy use of TSE and try it for himself, ignoring the multiple negative comments to his post.  And you want to attack me for wanting to keep TSE weapons in the game, a solution we are pigeonholed into by Bethesda unless you have 10 people ready to go at any time, get them on the same server, and manage to carry the other 10 who show up sometimes.  It's silly and you're being silly, but I don't hold it against you because people using TSE in events is very frustrating and you're clearly riding that wave.
---
When you trade for an item it isn't flagged dup. Who knows if they did this you might get baned
---
Im presuming they are going to implement it into the upcoming Personal Vendor Bots we can have at our CAMPS. (since they will basically act as another way to store items)
---
Ok because someone need to literally carve it into the wall for you: There is a time and place to crack certain kinds of jokes. This is not the time nor place. What you are doing is the equivalent of someone making a post about their cancer and you come here and crack a cancer joke.
---
Get it?
---
Walk into the gazeebo following the path. In the center torn left and walk to the wall. Its mounted, and you will be inside almost facing the tennis courts 
---
The worst part is the game uses scrap&gt;mods&gt;bulk scrap, in that order. That's Toddtarded
---
System helps

So I ran into this cool cat yesterday that was kind enough to give me a ridiculous amount of plans he had in surplus. Metal walls and ultracite armor are the two I was most excited about/remember. He also gave me a ton of 1-3* legendaries. Nothing ridiculous but very cool of him. I had to log out because my wife needed a hand with something. I think I consumed all the plans I could but what I know for sure is that all of them were gone when I logged back in. I went to my CAMP and I can't build anything new. Checked armour work bench and found the same thing. CAMP items are locked and say that I need plans first. Armor shows nothing at all. I've used hundreds of plans but this is the first time I've ever been given any. Has this happened to anyone else? Curious if it's a known bug.
---
What in the living hell is wrong about Xenophobic? More so in the apocalypse? Or in their world period? Hell even in our modern world you'll not find a country without a healthy level of Xenophobia .. it's how humans survive .... fuck what the media has indoctrinated anyone in.
---
More to the point ... fallouts world. If you're a open arms, open borders type .. you're asking to be killed and have you shit stolen by raiders. That or be under the thumb of a rouge Chinese or even worse, replaced with a Synth. Though the synths are home grown so that just does not count as Xenophobia. To me while harsh, the ideology in 4 to me would be the one that would be the most likely to form.
---
I always side with the BoS in 4 too. Not so much in 3, not that they are any better in terms of not liking outsides and killing people so they could horde their tech.
---
Haz-Mat does not go over legendary pieces, it replaces all slots.
---
Wrong... Radaway has NEVER taken away more than 1 for me. Sometimes never remove a single one. 
---
To be honest it wouldn't surprise me if it is something like that. Hopefully they fix the weight bug with Auto Grenade Launchers and the Bear Arms perk card first that they introduced from the last patch.
---
You don't wear armor in pa.....
---
More likely to kill myself then the ghouls like that I just use melee to try not to hit other people 
---
To be fair, it's obviously hideous in the atom shop, as are the PA paints, I'm not sure why you needed to purchase it to find out.
---
You’re serious? Damn, took advice from a random to do that. Thanks, I’ll change this!
---
Your choice. Excavator set gives that +100 boost to carry weight so if you are ever in a position where you are tight, just equip and now you can fast travel.
---
Really?  I didnt know you stopped getting health after 50.  Either way, I still need a way
---
If we are talking realism my characters anal cavity wouldnt be able to hide all of those weapons and items up there.
---
A true hero.
---
I've spent about 4 hours wandering the wasteland with a new friend who I met. When I asked if he needed anything he said information.  We have wandered around a few times and helped each other.  What platform are you on?
---
***I just tag the things with screws (and other stuff I need)***
---
***I don’t have to stop and go do something tedious to get the screws***
---
***I don’t waste a bunch of time elsewhere***
---
Also, this thread has other people in it than you. 
---
Peace and Tranquility.
---
I have visited the armory 1000's of times.  Have never seen protected or shielded.   Am I doing something wrong?
---
That happened to me everytime I moved my camp, thankfully I haven't had to move it for weeks now. Kinda' sucks having to rebuild.
---
So... you're gonna hate me, but I got a TSE handmade rifle my second time at Whitesprings.  I thought it would be funny to Fatman the ghouls everyone was farming.  I had to wait 8 levels too use the damn thing.
---
No problem, don’t know why people downvoted you instead of correcting. Good luck friend. 
---
Awesome idea....after they fix the servers..
---
Oh nice.
---
I think it would be good to include crossplay between the Console versions but i wouldn't want it with PC due to the different input methods, different settings and hackers etc
---
I havrn’t had many disconnects before but today while playing with my gf (she was in other room) we both got disconnected all the time, she more badly than me (i don’t if this matters, but she was playing on old xbox one, i was on new xbone x). 
---
There was a nuke at whitesprings where we were, and few over 100 lvl players too. It was really annoying. 
---
Smh
---
I do have a blue bathrobe and red slippers that I had gotten from white springs resort...
---
Ah, that seems easier. I enjoy a little pvp when fighting for a workshop. But I have been the victim of unintentionally shooting another player not on my team during a huge ghoul attack at Whitesprings. Got a wanted level and everyone ganked me instantly.
---
For cobalt the area just north of whitesprings over the trainstation and the mine is better than the resort itself. Plus you get to disappoint a lot of people by just missing the resort.
---
100% agreed - would really like to see an option for level 50+ server instance (unlocked on hitting level 50) with level-scaled enemies across the map. There is a huge portion of the map that is under leveled for level 50+ players. Would give them significantly more endgame content to explore etc.
---
Basically just apply the level scaling on the eastern portion of the map to the rest of the map when selecting this option.
---
True but there's plenty of people, even a post on the main page, full of people insisting they'll only wear excavator+shocks all the time.
---
You have any bobble heads or aluminum?
---
I'm having a hard time following your rant...you dropped your legendary armor and are mad that you're allowed to do that?...
---
If I read that right, sounds like you should've been more careful. Never done this myself. 
---
Nice. Nice.
---
Ah I see what you're saying. I misread, my apologies. This would be great though no doubt.
---
I also had some healing happen last night.  I don't play with TSE weapons (IMO They are too powerful). But I had a couple mobs last night heal after I headshot crit then with my pistol vats crit build.  I thought it was lag.  I'll keep an eye out tonight to see if it happens again.
---
I'll have a look at it.
---
No version of the Fallout76.exe downloaded through the Bethesda.net launcher has ever contained the binary code for the console, and sStartingConsoleCommand has never worked with any of the officially released versions of the game. A few possibilities:
---
(1) The plans are in one or more Levelled lists in use in the game and can actually drop somewhere. Someone would have to datamine the SeventySix.esm to find out.
---
(2) A debug/QA/test version of the Fallout76.exe executable could have been leaked by an employee/ex-employee or someone could have hacked it from Bethesda
---
(3) Someone could have modified the executable and made things possible that were not possible with the official release version, such as porting the binary code for the console from Fallout 4)
---
(4) Someone could have used a program like CheatEngine (like any memory editor that Bethesda is not looking for in their anti-cheat) to cause a fast travel to the dev room cell or give themselves items that are not normally obtainable.
---
Hackers are highly intelligent and creative. The best can disassemble binary code and/or read opcodes and know exactly what the program is doing: find function call points and determine how to call them directly. The f4se team, for example, is highly skilled at these techniques and has added many awesome contributions to the modding community for Fallout 4.
---
Any talented programmer could do the same types of things to the Fallout76.exe, assuming they also bypassed it's anti-cheat technology first.
---
I traded workshops 4-5 times yesterday with someone while we powered up Poseidon. We never pvp‘d, but I got a good chunk of xp. 
---
Understandable completely.
---
tbh the only effective way is to monitor the lfg channel and hope someone has found him and join their server.
---
I can get on board with a shield but not with guns. Those two items do not work well together as your aim is dependent on the steadiness of your hand.
---
With 1 hand you'd just be swaying all over the place. It should be for 1 handed melee weapons, making them actually viable. Pistols are already viable.
---
I agree in fact
---
Yeah that works but its really annoying to have to do each time
---
It is flair. Not sure how to do it in mobile, but on the main fo76 subreddit in a PC browser, there is a box in the right hand column  that let's you pick your flair for this subreddit. 
---
A long time ago, people believed drinking it cured diseases. 
---
i regret buying  the no way emote its literally the same thing with a different symbol
---
I was trying to quest at Top of the World last night on my level 27, and I ended up giving up after a few server hops. 
---
Crouching multiple times keeps pulling me in and out of chameleon and more than likely confuses the hell out of them, so I resort to come here emotes, and bag shooting lol.
---
I got a TSE Handmade and Combat Shotgun from a friend. I don’t think you need it for 99% of the game. I only pull it out for nuke zones and scorched beast. 
---
It def makes the game easier but it ruins the game for me because it makes everything too easy. 
---
I’m at Charlie 
---
Orrrrr itd give a opportunity to add that 4th and 5th star on the west side, js I want me a 4 or 5 star weapon 
---
Well, for the lower levels I recommend [Arktos Pharma](https://i.imgur.com/rfDHmUt.jpg) , there's tons of mirrors, medical and chemical boxes there. If you have the chem search perk (forgot the name) you can easily walk out of there with 20-25 stims a run. 
---
Also, if you get the "craft double chems"  perk you can turn one stimpak into 4 diluted. Slower healing but more over all. (That would out you around 40-50 diluted stims just for one run)
---
I also recommend the healing mutation. You heal to full while out of combat so I never need to use stimpaks between encounters. 
---
All of these things combined and I don't even have to farm them any more.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/acvptm/wip_i_made_a_visual_catalog_matching_camp_assets/?st=JQLAM0S4&amp;sh=e6937869
---
There's not really any way of knowing. Some folks think he actually patrols around the map, others think he is a random spawn event at certain locations.
---
Oh wow that was quite hidden lol.  I passed it 40 times xD.  Thanks.   So yeah for anyone else looking, it's a stone structure with domed metal roofing and there is a sign saying the springhouse. 
---
Whats done is done so screw it back to farming. 
---
  Good luck to.you all. 
---
Since I have healing factor and a tank build my stimpacks have only been used on others for weeks. Its great to yell "Leeroy Jenkins" before running through a angry hoard to stim pack someone
---
The scorchbeast is default level 50, of course it's not an enemy for low level players. It's also the "big, bad guy" of the current issue in Appalachia at the moment. Lore-wise, this thing wiped out all the factions. If the BoS couldn't wipe them out, a player fresh out of the vault shouldn't be able to either. I've run away from them multiple times, it's not that hard.
---
I agree, their LoS is horrid, and they spam that stupid sonic wave screech wayyyyy to much. Aside from that, there's no reason as to why they should be nerfed. If you aren't leveled and geared enough, of course they are going to be challenging. Clip the wings, and they come down, then melee them to death. rinse and repeat
---
My point is this isnt the Bethesda bug queue, and the bug report is "I know the game is broken, so I used the broken state of the game to achieve an even more broken state. You're welcome, Bethesda." You people downvote dupers all day, then give karma to this person who is obviously duping or supporting dupers. If this person gave two shits about the state of the game, they wouldn't be intentionally breaking it. And the premise under which they "discovered" this bug is complete nonsense, like everyone else who posts on here saying "I'm not a duper but here's something I found while duping".
---
That’s literally like right out of the trailer
---
Doesn’t 50% of the bounty get dropped into the abyss?
---
Pc? I'm level 17 and work 2nd shift EST. So our times could line up.
---
Nah I get it, bad advice. Again, thanks man!
---
Probably a dumb question, but how can I find out how long I've played the game on Xbox? I thought it was under where you find the achievements, but I can't find it
---
I found him dead... so there’s that 
---
1) They don't care much for the game-- dont mind getting banned, boredom/dislike for the game, etc.
---
2) There are players who do like the game and dupe, and could probably be doing to trade/sell for ingame caps with players or to sell online.
---
3) A lot of these type of people like the psychological feeling of having 'god mode' over majority of the other playerbase. Showing off to them is their form of fun and entertainment.
---
I wouldnt mod right now. Bethesda itself said "Proceed at own risk" and the ToS and the EULA both have documentation against it.
---
I would wait until you have a green light!
---
Seriously, fuck this online bullshit. I just want my regular Fallout without all those disconnects and having to redo things over and over again. Whoever thought that Fallout would work in a multiplayer environment needs to be booted from their position.
---
  It's not the bugs that are killing this game. It's the cancerous online only mode.
---
i have had a level 20 come up attack my camps walls for no reason then after he kills me twice and i have almost killed him a level 100 comes out of no where and takes the bounty so i dont get my caps back 
---
Because it's fairly well known at this point on the sub. And some folks are just jerks and instinctively downvote things they already know.
---
No. A significant portion of people in America work holidays, I’ve personally worked the last three Christmas and New Years holidays. They can do it too, especially when they reach exponentially more consumers than most industries.
---
Thanks a lot !
---
I was standing near a players settlement and let the rocket turrets kill some legendary ememies. Did it three times but the fourth time gave me a bounty, I guess if  a players turrets destroys their own settlement I can somehow gain a bounty?
---
Feel free to think that. Only unsuccessful people repeat those words, cause that makes them feel better. Always trying to find an excuse, rather than work on their own flaws. You're just one of them
---
Yar.
---
- 1 is nukes on whitesprings as it spawns alot of enemies
---
- 2 is whitesprings itself.
---
Some events aren't bad like monster mash or uranium fever. They break up the tedium of hopping whitesprings till hoot eyes bleed
---
That would be SO appreciated 🙌
---
Ah thanks I'm on mobile that's why I didn't know
---
Eh, odds are they probably don't have what I'm farming at that moment. I don't steal loot much because of the stash cap, no need keeping 700 glass shards or 200 bones
---
in the challenges menu there's one for playing the game for 7800 hours. It will show your progress 250/7600
---
That chest piece is the bomb until you get a legendary.
---
Morgantown, then I would say visit the ash heap. Its lower level than grafton, but has a lot of content. From there grafton, and depending on your level the top of the world after. Warning anything in the savage divide, mire or cranberry bog will scale higher if another player walls by. So caution
---
The game is FANTASTIC. There is no 'economy' because you don't buy and sell to anyone except vendors. If you want to buy from players, you post on looking for group, however, that is totally optional. If you keep passive mode on, you also don't ever need to interact with another player ever, unless you claim a PvP Workstation.
---
Reference: I have Lv133 Shotgun/Melee/Heavy, Lv160 Stealth Sniper
---
Oh, an in game counter... I didn't even think to check for that. Thanks!
---
Seriously??? Is it a blue flower I should be looking for? I’ve never launched a nuke yet. I’ve only once wandered into the resort and collected yellow flower cake flux. Ok not totally sure what I’m doing. 
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
They arent challenging. Their impossible to both fight AND avoid. How is this NOT a problem?
---
Only 3?
---
I did the same with my character at lvl 15, except there was a two seperate teams of people, and they clearly werent working cohesively lol I only got to tag one legendary
---
I've started giving them out 10 at a time to newbies coming out of 76.
---
Had a similar but different thing happen today. Someone nuked the same site we had probably 10-15 players there mostly 100+'s. Took about 10% of the queen's health down and then she just stopped taking damage. After 45 minutes everyone just ran away because it was pointless. Still spawned scored creatures which were normal. 
---
It wasn't me but i was doing swarm of suitors at that leveland a 75+ bro saved my bacon.
---
I failed to stop the horde of level 20 mirelurks from spawning and the queen was level 35.
---
I got a marine tactical helmet out of it too.
---
Thanks to all high levels that help low folks
---
That’s your opinion. Not everyone is a minimalist and has to be forced to play a certain way just because Bethesda’s servers are trash. This game is primarily centred around unrealistically heavy items that clog up your stash very quickly and I have to be constantly be equipping weight reduction perks to even function. 
---
It’s a chore and it’s on Bethesda to make things better, their game was shipped a buggy almost unplayable mess and still is to this day. 
---
Int for building / crafting. 
---
Perception for rifles.
---
Agility for sneaking.
---
Luck for crits. 
---
There are also harvesting bonuses in some of those. Check out Nukedragons for an idea of what you want your build to be. 
---
Thank you for all the replies. I have decided to skip this game. The lack of RPG elements is a big turn off. The core game play loop is not attractive to me. 
---
This was a level 80 in the forest.
---
Nexus has plenty of well rated mods which are perfectly benign.  Yes, there is some risk, but if they ban players using QoL mods, Beth would face another storm from player reaction.
---
Way to go and Play It Forward! That's what I do here. I have a normal group I run with and we are always helping each other out, but I tend to help others as well I come across. It's not out of the norm for me to give out some ammo, heals, etc. The only challenge I do at times is taking over a workshop, a bit of "King of the Hill" so to speak and I don't tend to take it from someone who's actually sitting at the location. Other times I'll even simply go help defend a workshop for others. When someone challenges one I had, I go back an try and take it back sometimes. Other than that I'm super helpful to any and all.
---
[East side of the map](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Harpers_Ferry), in a very not-friendly for level 15 characters zone. You'll probably die several times trying to get there at that level.
---
It's just such an odd perk. It's not like Borderlands where it revives you. For that reason alone I don't take it.
---
I show everyone i group with at nuke zone. Usually pre 50 characters to have them tag while i bag it. Handing out .38/10mm auto weapon with 1k+ammo and piles of molotov cocktails.
---
The E in TSE is "explosive."  So, like grenades and missiles, your weapon benefits from explosive perks.
---
I have 9 bulk aluminum 
---
This was a level 80 in the forest
---
This is just a simulation..we gonna finish the main quest line and poof you are in Fallout China.  All the bugs gone, new engine etc.
---
They've already said they won't. Just that they don't support it. So if you break something it's on you.
---
These are lining plans for the Operative Underarmor. You buy the Urban/Forest Operative Underarmor from the Production terminal not armory. You buy the plans to mod the underarmor from the same production terminal. You won't see Shielded at first. You need to buy Treated version. Then leave. Then the resistant version. Then protected version. Then you will see shielded plans. About 2200+ caps in total
---
I wish PvP was more like a Swashbuckling Duel , i really think it needs an overhaul , but thats another topic, however if it was Swashbuckling fun id never put passive mode on. 
---
My definition of Swashbuckling - Obi Wan Vs Anakin 
---
OP isnt stupid, he just wants to play the broken game. The dumbest thing he did was buy it. SBs are the Cliff Racers of West Virginia. Im 200+ and everytime i see one i turn around and go the other way. Theyre not worth looting and far far too annoying to fight.
---
Rats,  im on xbox one x
---
Please also do a version that's 10 minutes with 9 minutes or so being the intro :)
---
When you can't afford paint..Use poop ;) 
---
Great results 99% of the time
---
&gt; this isnt the Bethesda bug queue
---
tbf it kinda is, and to their limited credit, the community managers do seem to respond fairly frequently with "i'll pass that on to the team" right here.
---
And it may just be me, but this is the first I've read about the bobblehead stacking problem beyond all the other duper issues that need addressing, so it probably does deserve some airtime.
---
Very true, you never 'need' to trade with players ever. You choose to, and usually when people are looking to buy something they want it cheap. Cheap prices are coming from duped items.
---
It's next to slocum's joe - there is a nuka cola billboard and my house is just infront of it ;)
---
oh i also have the big guns, small guns, strength and medicine bobble heads
---
Bobble heads are not hard to farm dude. 
---
Usually I go by these kind of posts, but that would be a cool idea. 
---
Dude this was a month ago when not everyone knew everything.
---
Top of the World's kind of centrally located, has a lot of nice camp spots nearby, two vendors, and even a freebie pile of frag grenades from all the dead raiders. And generally piles of super mutants if you're into farming them for caps.
---
Though yeah, given the layout of the main quest, Top of the World and generally along the road/rail in the savage divide could use a bit of a level clamp on enemies. 
---
Here is our conversation for anyone curious.  https://i.imgur.com/KfQIYlC.jpg 
---
You didnt farm hundreds of bobbleheads, dude. Just be honest with yourself.
---
I've found 3 legendary weapons at the greenbriar, issued a bounty for no reason then got disconnected. Now I've not only lost my 10 bottle caps and my 3 legendary weapons but my my will to play this game. I honestly like this game but these bugs ruin the experience 
---
Bethesda has said they monitor here for bugs and stuff, so, while posting directly to Bethesda might be more effective, Reddit is an alternative that is also effective. 
---
You're gonna hate me. It popped for me the first time I did the Enclave quest, then not the next time I went back there but the time after that. /1/ server hop.
---
Don't wait dude, just play the game. You will return here and say what a blast you have, and how all the news is fake news sponsored by the other game companies trying to milk Max in game transactions.
---
Should do a lockout like when you fail hacking a terminal..except way longer :P (maybe this was said but he'll if I'm reading all these comments lol)
---
Bean pods and tree sap are the big sources of Cobalt Flux in that area.
---
If you've unlocked the command section in the Enclave bunker, you can find notes that state which flora yield which flux when harvested.
---
I suggest not maxing out any perks until level 15. You will receive a lot of perk cards in packs 2-15 and if skills are capped early, you will likely receive extra cards from those 1st few perk packs. 
---
And use melee weapons early, maybe up to level 10ish Cheap and easy to fix. No need to ration ammo. 
---
It’s often cheaper to create new armor rather than fix what you have. Until you have some really good legendary armor, just craft leather armor.
---
Break down tour junk at a workbench before you put it into your stash. And do this often. 
---
holy shit batman, play more than 20% of far better games!
---
You have to have a Power Armor frame in a Power Armor station to craft them. You can't make them without a frame in place. That's about the only thing I can think of that might prevent you from making them a second time.
---
The RFN discord linked in the sidebar has an LFG channel. We have 4k members online at any given time and over 15k members.
---
The BOS also talk about it in Tactics, there is a tribal which gets one from a raider when he is held captive by them. I think in FO2 you also got the poisoned status effect if you shot a porno in reno haha.
---
They are easy to avoid..the east side of the map is where they spawn. If they are impossible to fight then that means you aren't a high enough level.
---
I have a silo code
---
Very early on i grab lead belly as rads are an issue before you're swimming in rad away.
---
Good doggy is handy too for an easy food replacement.
---
Unless doing a str build (and even if you are) travelling pharmacy is good for weight reduction.
---
True hiker in agi is useful early.
---
I find most of my weight problems are food/chem related not gear/junk related.
---
You can't save levels to get later perks so don't bother saving. 
---
As a player on an alt your special points are key, don't worry about perks early game as at end game you'll shift quite a few.
---
I'd say your main damage perks are more in stone.
---
Pick what helps you now, not what your final build requires.
---
12k and 8 bulk aluminum for both guns?
---
Upvote this shit outta that please. Whoever made it deserves a statue in his/her honor. 
---
What town is that?  
---
Great shot, the detail is lovely.
---
Wow. So many thumbs down. I guess we are being really offensive.
---
Ah yes. The amount of time someone requests the 500 .50 cal bullets that I'm using is kind of crazy. Think it would be obvious that I'm carrying hundreds of one type and handfuls of the others which one is mine.
---
I'd guess we're waiting on "Player Vending" for any trade improvements though.
---
If you're blind with rage from a video game, it's time to pack it up and go outside
---
That's like saying Tigers are just cats. Technically true, but definitely missing important context.
---
I have pacifist on and I was one shot killed by some guy at random today. He started trash talking about my marine armor but I blocked him halfway through his sentence. Back to work tomorrow, I got no time for asshats.
---
This game is relaxing and single player. Until you decide to make it multi player. A large 'IF' you decide. You can play 100% with nobody else, until you need to kill scorch queen. For SQ just make a looking for group post and the server will be full in minutes. Enjoy!
---
Good for you!! Fellow girl gamer here. My ex-fiance once told me i was too bad at shooters to play halo with. So i completed Halo. 
---
Videogames are meant for fun. Fuck anyone who says you arent good enough to even play them. Im glad youre having fun with this one!! And dont forget, they out in the VATS system for a reason. Theres no shame in using it. 
---
North of Abbie’s bunker is a crash site with a random spawn. I was level 100+, the deathclaw I found there was lvl 21
---
What does tse stand for? 
---
I didn’t farm anything recently. But at one point I had about 50 with no real effort to farm them 
---
Did you ever find the hat? I found an extra 1 on ps4 if you're interested
---
Doubt it's caps. I don't dupe and I have no problem maxing caps.
---
The best way to have kept this under wraps, was to not talk about it. Now you have two groups of people now, abusers, and the dupers to sell to them...
---
If you are doing workshops often and don't have Contractor perk maxed, you are wasting a lot of materials.  Just about everything costs like 1 item each
---
I must be dreaming of cross platform :/.. it’s ps4
---
A. Platform?
---
B. What DO you need?
---
C. Sell some shit you don’t so you’re not maxed out anymore 
---
But the benefit is greater than the rifle damage?
---
Aight sounds like probably. Though I can say just explosive is enough, am level 104 and have a single explosive weapon, it’s a lv 35 shotgun with troubleshooter as well, and even without two shot and it not being max level I one shot mysef in power armor if I use it to close (and I specd a bit into health, I sit around 400 max hp usually slightly under) though his buddy having identical gear and them being lowerish level probably means your right 
---
It's to the fact that they knew I couldn't do anything, taunting me and destroying everything because they can. I know I could have just quit the game, but I was trying to enjoy it, no need to make such a comment
---
Plus, tax break for donations.  Capitalist not Communist.
---
Uninstall. Go play some Overwatch.
---
I think that is the biggest thing.
---
Everyone hops on here telling me off but nobody has actually done it.
---
I mean you gave me a solid answer without being a dick which I an thankful for. However;
---
I can’t see them putting something in the game like this after instating PvP for the first time (it is their first multiplayer fallout of course).
---
Now the gun I have has 2k damage at the moment. I have one shotted PA guys with guns at only 1k. 
---
My question is my 2k damage should “overkill” someone, meaning doing more damage past the point of death or so it does in PA.
---
He had slap damage done to him (like i said visually about 5%) so he had to ignore more than 95% of damage, do you know what I mean?
---
If he ignores say 95% damage, it shouldn’t mean I do 5% of his health bar, because I do over double damage than someone else has health.
---
So it would (lets say I do 200% of his health with one shot) take 10% of his health bar, wouldn’t it?
---
God this shit is confusing we need someone to mythbust this stuff lmao
---
I'm level 113 and partake in every ghoul farm I can, I've found hundreds upon hundreds of legendaries but I've yet to find a single two-shot or explosive gun. The best thing I found is a furious .50 HMG. The cool thing is when I finally pop that cherry, it's probably going to be a single-action revolver or a gamma gun.
---
I can however build Trump's wall with all the auto-stim wood armor I've found. I wish it was removed from the loot table altogether at this point.
---
Ah thanks for the reply but I’m on ps4. Just updated the post.
---
I have 2 TSE guns. Both dropped at whitesprings. I gave both to my 2 buddies bc they fit their build (Im melee bloody build). RL friends i play with. 
---
We run workshops every night. Target claimed ones bc we want pvp battles. 
---
We are not dupers nor are our weapons. We are just playing the game as it is intended. 
---
No problem friend! Enjoy! 
---
Have you done everything in the game yet, maybe go exploring?
---
Its technically a gazebo, but not one of those wooden flimsy ones you see everywhere, but the giant stone one with pillars and hedges/flowers surrounding it. Its location is on the train station side of the tennis club. The fountain itself is located on the outer inside rim of the gazebo.
---
The event is bugged. Never was able to complete it until I teamed up with someone. I stayed on the island and sniped, and my teammate ran around the shores spawning and finding and killing the stuck mirelurks until the mirelurk queen appeared. When she was killed the event completed and we got rewards.
---
Which mobs? Any with a star regenerate their health when they drop to 50%. Scorchbeast Queen mutates and regenerates to full health as part of her spawn and fight too but I'm not sure of the conditions as it sometimes doesn't happen. 
---
I’m kinda sick of overwatch considering I’ve been playing it since the beta came out in done with that game for good. And why uninstall?
---
I could kill normal(like supermutants, not mirelurk queens) level 50s when I was level 20. I didn't even know what caused them to appear because it wasn't a big deal for me.  I have more of a problem with scorchbeasts because they never land,
---
I crashed twice attempting to run the queen today, once in the silo before launch and once halfway through the queen. I sent a request. IGN: Pyra417
---
Go play with other people, try perfecting powerful builds, start a trading or service company, role play a drug lord
---
I feel like this was intentional lol. I have noticed the same thing past few weeks. Takes forever to load out then back in. 
---
Dude I don't get it. I am level 47 and if I am in the forest on short food hunt, I get asked again and again by level 5-10s to team up. Like, dude, I don't want to help you boil water. 
---
Sunshine Meadows
---
I wanna hold of exploring to explore with some friends and try to discover every location when we get another Break off school 
---
Id like them to be more difficult as well
---
Not everyone is at that level of power.  
---
Kill the enemies first. fast travel kills your flux
---
Ive started to vendor at Flatwoods for the specific reason of helping out new players since the influx of newbies over the holidays.  When I visit Bob, I drop extra ammo, random scrapped junk, 
---
I'm really looking forward to setting up a bed and breakfast on the next update with food, ammo and fully kitted out lvl 10-40 legendary gear for sale at less than 100 caps, plus kitted out basic armor and weapons for very low prices to get new players an advantage when they first get into Charleston and see that Grafton Monster wandering around the viaduct.  So far I've saved a sledgehammer with instigating and faster melee speed, an explosive +30% bug damage pipe rifle, a furious vampiric ripper, and a mutant's armor piercing AK.
---
I'm at the point where I have very little to do aside from collect 200 caps from each of the vendors, eat spoiled hot dogs once a day, make soup, do events and farm Watoga bots for random legendary gear, then farm legendaries whenever a blast happens.  The "perfect" armor and weapons would be nice, but even one triple star piece of metal or combat armor with my ideal effects is almost impossible to land.
---
I'm on pc :(
---
Lol I was talking about all the dupers. Chill.
---
It's good enough without perks but if you want an easier queen fight get the percent chance to cripple perk. Crippling her wings keeps her on the ground or forces her to land and the legs keep her from darting around.
---
On XB1, please fix the fat man/mirv launcher. It triggers the explosion way too close to me, even if I'm aiming a good distance away. It especially seems to do it when sneaking. 
---
Probably trying to give you stuff. People look at and shoot at stuff to point your attention towards it all the time. Did you check what was in it? I would assume it had a few hundred/thousand of ammo the guy didn't need, along with some stims and purified water
---
The whole thing for me is I don't know where to go. Any tips for a lvl 7?
---
And some paint sets are unique for each set.
---
I have a 50
---
Yeah that works, give me a minute to get my stuff and ill join your world. my IGN:LovelessNiko
---
Idk why got downvoted, so far this is the most fun and rewarding thing in the game. I'm still new and I like helping even newer players.
---
Ok I’m at charlie 
---
Spikes have collision physics, you can make “ledges” with them. It’s best to use two or three at a time close together to improve the “ledge” aspect IIRC.
---
I agree. This is the best solution. The "economy" will be fine regardless if it's flooded with duped items because the duped items are still worth the same amount. Caps aren't worth shit but the items still are.
---
Oh, sorry I'll edit it! I'm on pc.
---
If this is right, you're making my week. Can't wait to test it.
---
Cap limit is restricted by account. You have max 5 characters max 25k each. 125k hard cap.
---
To bad everyone becomes part of all of them.
---
I was doing doing that the first week FO76 came out in addition to the non-existent push-to-talk button.
---
Would just approach them, tell them to stick em up and drop any chems they have.
---
Some pretty funny results. Some would just turn around and walk away, a few would start attacking me, and a some even started running away.
---
It is MY server because it is the server that I am on. Duh!
---
Well if your melee it's hard to kill anything until have some damage resist.
---
Oh wow that's pretty cool. I will have to try that myself! Thank you for the info my friend!
---
both are max lvl right? sorry just wanna doublecheck
---
 If they have a CAMP you can figure out where it is by watching them for a while. I have done that after being griefed and noticing my griefer staying in one spot for quite a while. 
---
 I went and ran up 100 cap bounty on his CAMP. ;) 
---
Go and hunt for good legendaries
---
Noticed that myself. For me it was a baseball being duplicated.
---
What are you looking to get for it?
---
SUH-Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.
---
Weapon Artisan, appearently melee weapons get damage boost from having bonus durability.
---
Start a new, completely different character. Different play style, different weapons, different gender even. Also add some self inflicted restrictions or limits on things,
---
Eg. No special points above 9, or never use any weapon that’s actual weight is over 10 pounds, or the one I wanna try: never use PA (even in nukes)
---
Keeps things interesting and really can amp up the difficulty. 
---
Nope, 1 man’s autism is another mans excuse for shitty parenting.
---
Can’t be deathclaw island. Has to be a random encounter 
---
I know that, I meant I wouldn't care if they restrict it to 25k for the whole account (all characters share the same caps).
---
Has anyone found the plans for deep pocketed trapper chest?
---
I’ve found deep pocketed trapper limbs but can’t find the plans for the chest anywhere...
---
Yeah I checked there a few times always spawned a level 40
---
First thing I would suggest is turning on pacifist mode when farming that area. There is always some a hole that walks in front of me and starts that downward spiral. With pacifist mode on I just swing with no regard. Then if they get really annoying just hop server. 
---
You have to finish the main quest. I don't want to spoil it but that is what gets you access.
---
I help out randoms from time to time when I come across one that needs defending. I simply wave and fight off whatever is attacking them I move on. Other times if I come across one I might challenge to take control of it. Noting personal, just a bit of "King of the Hill" and if someone challenges one I have, then I tend to go back and see if I can take it back. I don't spend hours and hours on fighting for them. Other than that, I'm friendly to all when I'm roaming about and wave and help out where I can, even sharing some of my resources. I leave people's camps off limits, nothing to gain from messing up someones hard work.
---
I had that idea, but it wouldn't have worked considering their time wasn't spent at their CAMP, but instead trying to kill me and my buddy. If I did find it however, I would disregard the cap bounty and go in.
---
It’s an excuse for shirty parents and lazy kids.  Being awkward is normal not an excuse.  Rainman had autism, kids that can’t socialize are called teenagers.  Adults with autism these days are just teenagers that haven’t grown up.
---
It’s not like I meant to pick him, it was random. I needed a target, you can’t just shoot at nothing. 
---
That’s a waste of ammunition. 
---
It depends, I don't know exactly how the formula works but with 250 DR which is really easy to get in level 50 gear he can already reduce your damage by over 93% with just Sentinel and one Empath/Lone Wanderer. If he was really optimized then he could probably get close to 99% reduction against you.
---
That's where you'd go from dealing 5x his health in damage per shot to just 5%.
---
Ahhhh, dunno.
---
No its good fun. At times it annoying. 
---
idk why but i want to see soem wanted player just try to attack and get deleted
---
All mobs any mobs, it's NOT the same regeneration seen in legndaries. I know about all of that. Like I've said I can't really pin point why they do that, though I wish I could.
---
This is tick health coming back during being damaged. I've used the example before .. If I am doing 5 dps per shot, they are healing for 2 hp. So when they should have died they still have 5-15% hp that healed back, requiring more ammo to down it.
---
Again .. not legendary mobs just any and all other regular mobs.
---
I already know you're a duper and you actively participate in the duper economy. If your only defense is "maybe the guy selling hundreds of bobbleheads to me for my awesome game breaking experiment legitimately collected them all," then I rest my fucking case. Stop breaking the fucking game then whining about it for karma.
---
Unfortunately, with Xbox, they can follow you to whatever server by pressing [join game], but when I blocked them to solve the issue, they joined off of one of my team members who didn't get to do so. But I agree, pacifist would have been great in hindsight
---
You could also try posting to r/fo76bazaar and see if anyone is interested as well. 
---
Yeah the 200% repair, I've got that. Also, you said perk cards instead of perk card, I was wonderingif there were others. It seems the other damage perks like melee/unarmed dont effect it. 
---
Thank you for the info! Good stuff to know. I should hit 15 tonight and I think I've got enough caps on that account to buy it right away. I'll report back to see if my results are comparable. 
---
Rumor is that Explosive Vents are currently not working in game. I've seen a few reports around here to that effect.
---
Haha definitely spikes and shit, or even pots and pans lmao PAN SHOT!!! 
---
And this solves my confusion as to why my game wants to make bullets out of kids instead of the 1200 bulk steel I have just laying there...
---
What platform? I've been playing PS4 and I've only been disconnected 4-5 times total since I started playing.
---
&gt; Ouch :(
---
He's hitting you?! You should consider a divorce then, too.
---
Awesome, gives me a place to start.
---
Equally valid point, but if someone is commenting about gameplay mechanics and such; stuff that any played character in-game wouldn't know about, then odds are they're not in character at the moment.  Not saying that you shouldn't be doing this stuff, mind you. But that you should try to pick your words more carefully so people know you're in character, because in that comment you made, it seemed like you were coming off as a jerk.
---
“Learnt”, really?
---
I am level 20 on PS4, feel free to add me TheMeiserVader
---
I get that, I'm a dev also. Will never play another RTS in my life after having made one. Hence the second part of my comment about hiring people.
---
I use rivatuner as is to lock 60fps. Have done for years. Every Bethesda game since oblivion has required me to do this to remove microstutter. But now that it's tied to the server to present speedhackibg I understand why. But the trade off is horrendous microstutter on top of frequent framerate drops 
---
Some extra time, the server crapped out at mainframe cores and i'm having to restart the process.  This happens about 1/3 times sadly.
---
Yeah I've wanted 5 min a few times currently stuck in one now. Just fresh installed and modded fallout 4 with sim settlements, might give up on this till alot of new content launches.
---
I really don't know why everyone is bitching about TSE weapons.  They are literally 5-10k caps.  You can make that selling to the vendor in less than 10 days.  Buy your own you crybabies.  Even if NONE were ever duped, there would still be in the game and you'd still have to contend with people who have them.  
---
I really truly don't experience most of the bugs people come on here and go on for ages about, but this bugs me. Intentional duping is bad enough, now the game just doing it for us is crazy
---
you must build a farm now its the rules
---
 If you are crouched they cannot see you. Go stealth for this kind of play. I sneaked quite a ways to surprise that sucker.
---
But if you could still sight in?
---
He isn’t wrong, could be British as it’s common over there
---
What do you mean? I've fast traveled with raw flux before, and it was still fine when I got to a workbench to stabilize it.
---
Now if Bethesda would fix letting us accidentally auto-scrap hardened masses, that'd be great....
---
Yea I always block then go offline if they are a total tool. 
---
Yeah I just hid half the time while the robots and the scorch beast fought each other. I don't even have stealth perks.
---
Have you tried putting it in rice over night?
---
What is violet flux?
---
English isn't his native language, fuckhead.
---
It is absurd, but I want to see a queen get one-shot
---
Is it doable with your dragon? If so, please, do it and post a video of it!
---
Ah lame
---
I found one. I think its considered a rare outfit. Found it on the randomly spawning vendor outside charleston station that also sells the hunters longcoat. Would consider selling it on PS4 server for the right price or trade
---
Take a trip up or down Route 66. Or grind the Ash Heap. If you don’t want to just grind WhiteSprings or Nuke Zones. 
---
I’m also looking for a All rise
---
Or a cap on all item stacks could fix this. From what I've read, people get around the current call by dropping stuff and picking it back up or something. If they had caps on all of it (at least temporarily). That would fix that issue. 
---
Also, I'm hoping the next ban wave hits by the end of the month. They have to have log after log from server crashes and can clearly see what happened before the crashes.
---
&gt;This is the best pvp I have encountered so far.
---
I was expecting another complaint post, I was pleasantly surprised. 
---
It's apparently a word substituted in England for "learned". Both seem acceptable.
---
Suppose it's like color and colour.
---
Oh I know, I meant who plans on modding when it's green lit. 
---
There is valid concern and constitutive criticism about it, however alot of band wagon bashing going on. It was worth the purchase to me, even at the launch price, depends how you value a game. 
---
They did nerf them quite a bit. They used to have no stop robots that were much higher level.
---
 I've seen several post of higher levels (50+) asking how hard the silos are. The real challenge is just worrying about getting hit with a disconnect. Good job finally getting it. People still give props? 
---

There have been some past posts on here showing all the non-workshop free sites where things naturally occur. You can pick a concrete spot, drop your camp there with an extractor and run around doing things and then come back and have 10-20 ready to go. 
---
Anyone worried about which set of PA to use should be at least level 50 and considering max level PA and also therefore should have at least 2K caps to by any flavor of TSE weapon. 
---
I agree with the skin part, hence why I noted “unless you like the look of a different set of PA”
---
“Look at me, I’m a good person” that’s why it gets downvoted. An actual nice thing is doing this for someone and then shutting the fuck up about it. 
---
You still can. Just leave them alone for a bit. Go to Morgantown high school and collect all the stuff there. In one run you should be getting around 15 screws, 120 plastic, 100 steel, and some other good things. By the time you get back to your camp with all of that, your purifiers should all be decently full. 
---
I’m game. Sir_cakington
---
It's not just that, it can happen to anything you drop.  I've lost a few things this way.  No paper bag appears and the item is just gone.
---
I'm not sure you understand, so I will explain it with apples and pears .
---
The fallout 76 map is correct coded
---
* Green= Forest ; lvl 1-12 enemies
---
* Blue= Toxic Valley ; lvl 10-25 enemies
---
* Brown= Savage divide ; lvl 15-99
---
* Black(left)= Ash heap ; lvl 25-35
---
* Black(right)= The mire ; lvl 30-99
---
* Red = Cranberry bog ; lvl 35-99
---
Fixed encounters and Fissure sites are the only exceptions to those level rules. If you happen to find a scorch beast out of the high level zones means it's from a Fissure site which is a BIG ROUND YELLOW ICON ON THE MAP! , Maybe they set the fissure site icon color same as the v76 so you could feel safe, it's not like yellow is a color for caution or being it different would draw your attention , still fissure sites should be avoided by low lvl players in case you did not understand the irony. Which by no means fissure sites block paths, most of the enemies on low level map zones at fissure sites spawn as white enemies and by no means they leave their respective place to chase you around. 
---
So you complaining that you hit a wall cause you can't kill an enemy you are not supposed to yet is dumb, they are far from hard, if you are full prepared they take just one slap to die, anyways, games are to have fun, if you ain't having fun why are you playing it? That just means you ain't playing it right or that is not for you and you should stop playing it. Have fun!
---
@bethesda might be a good thing to fix!
---
Thanks! I will check them out!
---
appreciate the insightful reply, I know EU has stricter consumer protection laws but I wasn't aware of that. in terms of how companies use TOS as a loophole, you still own the product itself and its contents (IE: Fallout 76 and its data) however you would be banned from the service itself zenimax is providing in its servers, im not sure how that would interact with those laws.
---
completely understandable on the atom shop thing. i dont think that lunchboxes are going to be as big a deal as some claim though. probably just going to be random cosmetics that are no longer available and you get the small 15 minute buff for opening them. i dont personally consider that p2w considering it would be unsustainable except for millionaire whales as long as they price lunchboxes at 50-100 atoms each.
---
You can get up there without spikes. There's a pathway all the way to the top
---
Sorry for my assumption and misunderstanding.
---
Yeah, he was being a dick.  But he may have not had his mic turned on for area?  (Unless you’d been conversing back and forth in which case, again, dick)
---
THIS is 100% right. Seems like BGS gave everyone a few weeks off with no exceptions though. 
---
I like it!  Super mutants with fridge doors making shield walls as they lob granades over at you!
---
once again you are an idiot. 
---
Love the story! It's a little reminisnt to Fallout 3 to me where the Dad leaves the vault and you have to go find him and help him. Exept you guys left the vault together! Way to go!
---
The generator plans are not actually from the Workshop at that location. Rather, they're from the **event** "Powering up (insert plant name here)." The event lasts 60 minutes, and takes between 20-30 minutes to complete (once you know what you're doing).
---
Basically, you have to enter three areas of the power plant and repair broken items: mostly leaking pipes (cracked, hissing and marked with yellow/black stripes) and broken switching stations (sparking and look like they've been smashed with a hammer). Once you've got most of the repairs done in area, you'll get compass quest markers for the last few you might have missed. And once you get a certain number done, that area will complete... but there's still 4-5 more broken items and you can fix those to "fully repair" the area, for slightly better rewards in the end.
---
Once you've repaired all three zones, you have to get to the control room, find the main terminal and restart the power plant. That completes the event, and everyone in the area gets rewards, including at least one set of Plans for a generator you don't know.
---
Since you can get the Medium Generator plans from the main quest, that means you'll randomly get one of either Large Generator, Windmill Generator or Fusion Generator plans. If you have bad luck, that means you need three runs of the event to get the Fusion plans.
---
Perhaps you were in an area where there were no sufficiently open spaces for it to land? It's not just a single instance recorded in that video. I do it all the time. Once killed 4 scorchbeasts in one fight and they stayed airborne until shortly after I crippled their wings with VATS crits, then they would land. All 4 in the same order I crippled them. no coincidence. But yeah, if the terrain is all uneven then it wont land. I've been told that if a scorchbeast is constantly being shot at then it may not land but I haven't tested that one.
---
I took it from the top of Hornwright Estate the town is Lewisburg.
---
Oh wow zooming in on the picture I can it now but at a glance it looked like part of you house!
---
They don't care. A lot of them are selling this shit for real cash, they could give a shit about the game or the people playing it.
---
I've read Optimized Bracers also don't do anything. I mean this stuff is extremely easy to check for the developers. They really need to check every perk and item and consumable etc. and make sure they are all working. It's really BS having items, mods, perks that are meant to do something but are no better than having nothing at all.
---
I'd be fine with using the shield as a way to steady the gun for aiming at a range but hip fire should not be a thing or at least accurate at all  with a gun and shield XD. But it being the "legs" used to steady the weapon, sure that seems legit.
---
If you have an idea of how you want to build your character you can use this site to see all the cards, design your build, and then it will show you what cards to pick at each level.

The game was ruined at launch.
---
Im level 12 on ps4 !
---
So confused that so many are still experiencing server crashes. I have had 2 crashes in the last two weeks and I pay 1-2 hours at a time. Seems like nukes are still a part of the problem. It's not happening every nuke but both of my recent crashes did include a nuke somewhere in the map. Have you noticed any correlation?
---
So maybe 10 is an order of magnitude to low, would you support something like 50?
---
Each fissure gets its own “ species queen”.
---
That would be great. 
---
Yes, any info would be helpful. What perks do you use? What weapons? 
---
PSA: You can say this in game isntead of making a post on reddit hours later.

Have you played other fallouts people tend to keep everything 
---
I'm sure the hip kids at r/fallout will think you're super cool for that.
---
I think someone tried to do armed robbery though. Pointed at bag with gun and using $$ emoji. 
---
Mon-Fri: 4pm-6pm
---
Sat-Sun: Anywhere between 10am-6pm
---
He's kind of right. If you pick up more than 1, you get 40 caps instead of 25. But.. that seems to be the only difference. 
---
I don't know man, they seem to be having lots of fun with their tses.
---
meanwhile lots of people seem miserable while farming the golf course again and again.
---
and again.
---
I specd into melee / energy pistols as a secondary ,,, in Fallout4 i personally always preferred "Furious" on my Legendary and then dose up on Psychobuff / Colas.. 
---
Freezing was good too but they've limited that to just cryo stuff in 76, wich i don't know why they didn't also limit Explosive to an extent aswell.
---
Having a Freezing Security Baton in 4 was funny.  
---
Lol, well done! 
---
Yes but dont wait too long
---
Not really, this doesn't need a fix. Dropping something means you don't want it. We have a trade menu to give things to other players. If you do want to use the drop to give stuff then drop a bullet or spoiled meat/veg first, just to make sure the bag doesnt disappear. 
---
But also, does the left arm exist?? (I know it does but damn, I’m having a hard time finding it)
---
Two shot explosive rolling pin
---
Yeah, it just made the rice immune to damage.
---
I haven't tested that myself yet and I'm not sure what kind of rifle build you are but there's a couple that can straight out kill them faster than I can with crippling shotguns. One-shot sneak attack rifle builds and crit automatic rifile (commando) builds take them out in seconds. There's several videos on youtube if you're interested.
---
This too.
---
I'm very surprised (disappointed) that many of the inventory mods that were created for FO4  were not incorporated with FO76.   This also goes for many of the animation, weapon etc etc bugs that are still in the game but we're fixed by modders.  
---
Did you get your hands on this yet?
---
U lucky bastard
---
There's a trade emporium discord? I haven't seen that one advertised.
---
To the OP, I never played any of the fallout games, this is my first time on the series and i think its great. Yeah it has issues but its a huge world with alot of ppl so yeah stuff isn't perfect but I really enjoy it. Yeah sometimes I get d/c but not like I do when I play rdr2 lol. Who cares what ppl say, if you are having fun thats what matters 👍
---
Agreed, its meant to be desolate anyways :D
---
Here’s how I do it (I’m on Xbox one x also)
---
First, you need to have the Xbox app downloaded to your phone.
---
From the in-game photo menu, take a screenshot of your desired pic via the Xbox screenshot feature (toggle off the pic interface/UI for a clean photo)
---
Open up the Xbox app on your phone, go to the “captures” tab, find your photo!
---
Enjoy!
---
Molotov cocktails highly recommended for these. Cheap to make and Chuck in the scrum and watch the so bad climb an insane emount.
---
My understanding is that silos scale to group sizes
---
The stone gazebo is also a nice spot to sit and blast away at the deathclaw in the area. Poor fella is too big to fit through the pillars so it's easy pickin's. 
---
Y'all trade with people who don't have mics?
---
I thought I read somewhere that you clear the final Overseer quest by listening to a holotape that spawns at a launch site AFTER s launch.  
---
Yup, duping is a giant problem
---
Rumor has it this is why we lost Vietnam. We never stood a chance
---
I’ve managed to get a full set from the Vendor at Watoga Shopping plaza but if your looking for the actual plans then apparently there’s a house by Harpers ferry with the plan spawns. 
---
https://youtu.be/4PzGT5BEBGg
---
Its definitely a solution but way harder than it should be. A lot of trial and error depending on your camp location.
---
The friendly loading screen definitely sounds rad, lets hope someone didn't take some real wierd shots with mods though haha. 
---
I mean ... you REALLY don't need 5 int. BUT. It saves time.
---
Vendor hoping from server to server is tedious and not for everyone. Though I can imagine it's no worse than hopping from server to server cleaning out the same area to scrap weapons for mods.
---
It was a bunch of "Plans".
---
I wouldn't care no matter what they do if they get off their asses and fix a problem.
---
All right, fair enough. If you say “learnt” where I live it means you’ve probably masturbated to thoughts of your sister. 
---
My apologies, OP.
---
If you want to explore, 76. But if you want to build multiple things with little to no restrictions, plus with mods, 4. And if you wanna show that stuff off that you build, r/falloutsettlements is a great sub for that. 
---
He showed it lasts indefinitely if you just keep reloging with a certain perk. Meaning anyone can just keep reloging and stacking all bobbleheads they find forever. This affects everyone. Anyone can do this.
---
Not sure why people think this only affects duper's. Use your brains people and actually read the post.
---
It's been fine for me.  I'm a new player with maybe 10 hours and i'm only level 7. Have yet to experience any crashes or glitches, and also have not experienced any a-hole players.  So far it's been great
---
You're pretending like there is no tracking already. There are logs and hopefully Bethesda utilizes them. For all we know, they are and the ban wave is coming.
---
take a nap?
---
What isn’t an area with a scorchbeast? I didn’t go anywhere near cranberry bog and barely went past the savage divide until I hit the 40’s but yet I’ve been wrecked by them at my camp near Flatwoods, when I was leveling at Morgantown, over at the Poseidon plant, and so on. 
---
I agree that there’s not really anything to fix and I kinda like the idea that something completely out of my league is roaming around the entire map being a predator as it should be. Yet, it doesn’t make it any less frustrating when you are a low level and you figure out you can’t run away fast enough because it one shots you a mile away in the sky, or you run into a building to hide and it uses its sonic attack like a minigun and still simply blasts you through the walls.
---
Thanks. Just routine arthroscopic stuff. Will be back to work on Monday ... sigh.
---
Did you use the terminal to select the ammo you wanted?
---
Ha!
---
I know what you mean. In the south broken looking English generally means bad things, lol. But surprisingly, not always :P.
---
I haven’t made it that far in the story yet. I’m a slow grind. I’m about to go find Abbie’s bunker. 
---
I’ve only ventured deep into the savage divide for the train stations and other relatively save stuff. I’ve been caught out too many times and overpowered. As a shotgun player I was good at first but now I’m learning that shotguns aren’t great with higher level enemies. 
---
Lately I’ve just been doing workshops and events to get new plans for silly stuff. 
---
Sure you are, Mr Raider, sure.
---
There won't be any ban wave the most they will do is fix the duplicating glitch.
---
Are they level limited?    I used to see them not infrequently at the Watoga train station but haven’t in a very long time.   
---
MOLE MINER QUEEN

I'll wear it with pride &lt;3
---
Two shot explosive
---
Welcome, I swore people tested the Harpoon Gun and found it worked but with only 1 shot per magazine it was also more tedious. The syringer from that same thread was found to not work but there’s no harm in trying if you want.
---
Two Shot Explosive ...
---
Its the saught after legendary perk combination and one of the big reasons players are Duping or buying the weapons off ebay from a Duper. 
---
Wich while these players dupe it's affecting server stability and causing you and everyone on the server to disconnect.
---
Hey thanks! 
---
Dont know what a higher level would hope to gain from a low level in terms of robbing them. There isnt much you could have that would be any use to them, no offense. You cant drop caps and whatever he dropped to make the bag appear is up for grabs. I agree he was most likely trying to give you the stuff in the bag. Would make for a good youtube series: "Robbing low level players of their wood scraps and Water purifier plans!"
---
I could accept (very) light P2W, would really depends how it actually turns out.
---
I also expect that we'll eventually be able to purchase things like character slots, but those are more in the 1-time upgrade camp, so I've less issue with them.
---
If we can buy xp though, I'm out. :P
---
They were plans that the other character already knew and they were giving them to you to learn. 
---
It seems once you hit about 60-70 the game runs out of steam and it becomes a what do do fest.  
---
For me its to hit level 100 which is only 3 levels away.  
---
I would do challenges but too many are broken.
---
Thanks, nerd.
---
But seriously, awesome job!
---
So the bulk acid scrap acid thing still  works? 
---
Haha all good was supposed to be a little funny 
---
My dad passed away last year at 54 
---
We always played left 4 dead or took turns playing war game campaigns like Cod and what not 
---
He was a great guy always kept a smile on and could make ya laugh in any situation 
---

I thought most Bethesda games were garbage, which is why most people only think of Edler Scrolls and Fallout when they hear Bethesda.
---
Very nice, we just need more red flooring. I have a plain garage that houses the workshop benches and some propaganda posters on the wall. 
---
I was gifted a tse by a random and im still enjoying the game very much, i do however play with friends.
---
Get a girlfriend?
---
It doesn't waste any time to scroll on past it.
---
Not when he showed they can last forever. that means anyone can just stack all bobbleheads they ever find forever. It affects everyone.
---
Thank you very much for the detailed info.  I was wondering how you get the plans for the big 100 producing generator.  
---
Is this for both of the power plants?
---
That’s fair, except when you generally play solo and aren’t trying to go through a whole process, in this instance I was trying to drop my artillery grenades, but alas All Rise was above them. Also spoiled meat/veg=endless fertilizer
---
Giving then, I've done that to draw attention.  So funny though "holdups" maybe that's why some have run away for the hills.
---
Take this with a grain of salt because I haven't the source yet and absolutely no clue if it is true but here's that: bethesda may or may not have implemented a tool to check for players inventory once you log / log off during winter break and are gathering data.
---
I gotta get into this game 
---
Can’t wait to play games with my son in a few years
---
Raw endgame material.
---
The game isn't good in it's current state. We were all aware Bethesda would have no prior experience with AC systems. Why are we now surprised that there are follow up issues to people exploiting and abusing the game?
---
Thanks everyone, I'v made a new post for it but for everyone with notifications on here is the video :) hope it helps

I’m 27.
---
Would I still make it? I’ve been deep into Savage before
---
Indeed. Currently biggest problem are dupers and honestly they are good stress testers with their inventory weight worth of 1k+ players.

---
This has happened to me so many times now with x-01 mods and mods i have found for other power armors and weapons.
---
I've seen mobs just blink into existence right in front of me, materialize out of thin air just to scare the crap out of me. 
---
The Enclave plays on a bigger stage than the BoS. The long term needs necessary for a strong nation often require sacrifice. 
---
Sneak and run tactics 
---
Damn , large feels 
---
Oh sure, it's good with TSE, but so is every other gun. 
---
On the whole, revolvers, legendary or otherwise, are objectively worse than comparable melee weapons or rifles. Even with VATS crits, it takes my pistol character multiple crits to kill a Whitesprings ghoul even with my explosive 44. My fist weapons character, on the other hand can oneshot Whitesprings ghouls with his legendary power fist, whose only perk is +10% damage when mutated - keep in mind that fist weapons only have 1 Iron Fist card, whereas pistols have normal, expert *and* master Gunslinger cards.
---
I am new to flux farming so yes id love to check your video out.
---
The garage doors don’t match metal walls... they match with industrial (I think it’s called) walls
---
So far. I’m assuming that will be fixed eventually. 
---
I will test them all thank you! 
---
I agree with the accidental dropping bit. Saw another post where a player dropped a legendary and the bag vanished. From what I've read the bag falls through the ground so that could at least be fixed. Then there wouldn't be a problem.
---
Thanks.  I have gotten into the glassed cavern.  I will give a try at getting to the last transponsder before the cavern and go from there.  AFTER I build up some ammo....grrrr....
---
Idk about you but I would be dreading a Snallygaster Queen, could you imagine that disgusting monstrosity? Or even a sting wing queen, you’d never see straight 
---
I’m down
---
Yes. In fact it's the best thing to do, they probably have TSE weapons so as soon as you go back to your camp, more then likely you will die.
---
Overall, I like it and I’ve been playing it every day since I got it in November.
---
The fallout series always has a heavy grind for any sort of payoff.  I think in this particular game the balance between grind and payoff is more on the grind side which becomes frustrating by server issues.  
---
I think (hope) as the server issues and other bugs are addressed, the game will only get better.  Also, some other tweaks that have been suggested (larger stash sizes, etc) will also make it more fun.
---
Thanks for the info, anything on them though? 
---
Yup, I've done both Posiedon and Monongah plants for plans.
---
One word of warning, the Reactor sections are *heavily* irradiated. You'll either need lots of RadX &amp; Radaway, a Hazmat Suit, or Power Armor. And considering you'll be getting shot at, either the Power Armor or just lots of RadX are recommended. The Hazmat suits don't offer much protection.
---
Joining, got decent dps and will participate. "Not my first rodeo" lol
---
Wit?
---
They might as well be, I’m a level 78 and I haven’t seen them once at all. 
---
I know, but it still stupid thing if you get killed in  The *Whitespring* Resort.
---
PS4.
---
Yeah, plus I bet they had more explosive vents. That'll getcha every time
---
they use "learnt" in america? hmm never knew that.
---
Good. I’ve been consistently bulking junk, more to be able to sell extra. But it’s good to know there’s a storage benefit as well.
---
Now if we can just get a perk card that says that all weight reductions in play also apply to stash.
---
I'm running around in excavator armor, with extra Rad-X and radaway.  I should be good.  
---
I think the bullying comes from high level players seeing a group of level 20s and 30s chilling making steel and they run through with their TSE You Lose weapons for the sake of plowing the lowbies. They dont need the scrap or the workshop they just need to steamroll the players because they can.
---
That’s what I like to hear
---
Ya I bet.
---
VR blew my dad away haha 
---
Sorry for your loss
---
Started ok- I got the angler pack , dispatched with it and kept going. Then the bot stopped on the road near the Red Rocket and didn't move, no matter how much I moved and interacted. Quest failed at 18:00.
---
You get 10 shots from the Arty, and they respawn. Get out of here with that waste of ammo crap.
---
You can make well over 1k per day just from all the vendors. Then plus whatever else you can sell to other players.
---
/u/Kakashi20
---
Ha! Ok, I kind of thought  the opposite :)
---
Same here quest completed no rewards no queen. So I collected the toxic barrels instead 
---
You can make it at any level, though it may mean dying several times along the way. Do lots of sneaking and leave your scrap at home just in case. The Savage Divide tends to have lots of level 30 enemies, and as you head east you can run into higher leveled stuff.
---
No prob! I love the photo mode on 76 so much that I’m constantly having to delete pics (I take way too many haha!)
---
You know there are photo challenges that net you atoms right?
---
There is a challenge where you have to take 20 pics in each region of the map (Forest, Mire, Ash Heap, Toxic Valley, Savage Divide)
---
I assume he mean the universal ones like Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, Tenderizer, Glow Sight, Nerd Rage (unyielding builds)
---
I personally think they should stay, but their durability reduction should be multiplied by those effects. 
---
Example, your standard weapon doing 1.0x durability damage, explosive effect makes it do an additional 1.75x Durability damage. Have two shot multiply that by two, so if you have a twoshot explosive it's doing **5.5x** more durability damage to itself. Makes both of the effects still good in their own rights, and still useable while stacked, but certainly far from efficient. Especially given repair costs. 
---
I'm willing to bet all the people in here that are pissed off you made this public and are claiming this only affects duper's are the ones that have been abusing this. They are just pissed off you ruined their secret.
---
I ran Firebreather gear until I got my Excavator Armor, I'd love to get to rep them better somehow
---
I've only played fallout 3, new Vegas, 4, and 76. I get that hording is a thing in other games but I feel like we should be able to accept that they can make a game that doesn't involve hoarding, you know cause it crashes the game.
---
Also if you really want to you can hoard in this game. There is a perk that reduces weight of ... By 90% for basically everything. Duping is different. I'd say it is fine if it didn't cause server problems
---
Yeah, you should be set then!
---
Agee so much with this! Lost 2 T60 calibrated shocks that I meant to sell last night because of this. Bye 2000 caps... 😐
---
The original reason for a conservative increase was to wait and analyze stability. Because dupers are causing instability, the data is tainted and BGS likely wants more authentic data before they do it again.
---
Not really. This isn't FO4, there isn't much of a point to collecting teddy bears. You can't display them, they'll just sit there in her inventory.
---
I have gravitated to shotguns, but even then I hit maybe 1/2 - 2/3 of the time. I've resorted to always fighting in PA and walking close enough to the mobs that the shotgun barrel is literally in their face. It seems to be effective. And god bless the Enforcer perk. When we nuked White Springs, I would just kneecap the green glowing ghouls. A shot or two to each leg and all they can do is wriggle on the ground, and then it's easy to conk them over the head with a big hammer. Of course, given my aim, that's about 10 shells per ghoul, but what the heck: Grinding for shotgun shell mats isn't that tough, and there's always the ammo factory.  
---
I do love my handmade, though I burn through a metric ton of ammo with it. Firing it is just a satisfying experience, even if it is level 35.  
---
First reach level 100 so you get the achievement/trophy.  Then find a fresh level one player outside of vault 76 and drop everything from your inventory in front of them. Everything, weapons, armor, ammo, everything that can be dropped. Then, walk away, naked, into the wilderness and never use the fast travel option again. Live in the forest like a wildman. Using only what you can find. 
---
Litt
---
That would be awesome!
---
Now we're talking!
---
&gt;You're gonna get bored real fucking fast. Because now there's nothing to do. No challenge. No goal to work towards. Just aimlessly walking around and one shotting everything or if you're lucky maybe some of them will take two or three shots to kill.
---
So does that mean that everyone else playing the game is just progressing towards a state of boredom but at a slower pace? What happens when you get your legit TSE and stack of ammo?
---
&gt;You bought a game and now you just removed countless hours of entertainment from it
---
'Oh boy, I can't wait to kill ten thousand more scorched so I can be just as bored afterwards as the cheaters'
---
Do you want metal wall plans or the warehouse ones? 
---
Metal walls look nice, warehouse looks rundown.
---
Some may call this junk, but I call them treasures.
---
There is a monster running around Appalachia, and there is nothing we can do.
---
May god help us all...
---
Fucking gundams an shit
---
I’d be honored!!
---
It's just decent neighborly behavior.  When I started playing I assumed no one would help me and just opted into death to respawn quicker, but the community has been really surprising.  I've had players stand over my loot bag so other players had a hard time looting it until I got back, even if they never met me.  I always go out of my way to respond to help emotes, and most other players do too unless they're being directly attacked at the moment.  Blasts can get really chaotic and enemies come out of nowhere even if you just checked that your 6 is clear while parking on a ledge to overwatch trash during a fissure prime nuke with an explosive rifle.  Yes, some snipers actually want to be team players and apply real-life sniping tactics as an asset to other players.
---
I’ve tried giving people free stuff, sucks there is no option to let them know.  
---
Ah. Thanks.
---
Nuke launched, can expect queen dead within 10 minutes or so for those still hoping to join.  Just 2 of us so far!
---
Mothman statues. o3o and totems of dead things.
---
Clipboards you say?
---
Try Camp McClintock. I’ve picked up around 32 clipboards there...plus, there’s no enemies to waste your ammo on!
---
T60
---
Items in the stash won't be scrapped. And if it's cloth they use having a hundred or a few hundred cloth in the stash should make sure it doesn't use them instead. I'm just guessing with this though as I don't really know but I know I had some junk in my stash that never got scrapped until I removed it and scrapped it myself.
---
I like it more of how fast and easy is to bang bang bad guys :P
---
The good guys in Fallout 76 would be the Responders, though there's not much left of them. Right now I'm working on becoming an Enclave general.
---
In Fallout games I tend to squeeze what I can out of every NPC and faction, by the most pacifist and completionist methods, and then squeeze what I can out of betraying and destroying them.
---
In FO3 you had no choice but to help the Brotherhood. And then at the end of Broken Steel I'd destroy the Citadel to find some alien ammo and [Dirty Harry's](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Callahan%27s_Magnum) revolver in the ruins.
---
In New Vegas I'd get the safehouse keys (for max reputation) from every faction in one play. And then I'd do the Yes Man ending if any. I'd consider the Followers to be the good guys.
---
In FO4 I usually sided with the Railroad, after progressing as far as I could in all other factions. The Brotherhood were jerks, though I recall seeing a few "Curie Liked That" as I watched Maxson give his xenophobic speeches. The Minutemen were the good guys, but I hated all the settlement quests.
---
Been looking for the warehouse ones, complete the set. 
---
Yeah because you can find another one of the same bobblehead in 1 hour time? Every time you want?
---
I already used this timer exploit,but 1 or 2 hours is very restrictive. I know the location of at least 10 bobbleheads but they're not always there. It took me a week to find another explosive.
---
Also on PS4 and need code
---
Ah man you're the best.
---
Tbh I got used to it by now though. It reminds me of old Godzilla movies.
---
NemoTouchedDaBut ps4 lvl 115
---
I use ultracite gatling laser and all rise. 
---
Someone that doesn't know that there's stuff on it 
---
Your server is full :(.  I can handle all the other enemies to let people with good dps shoot the queen as well
---
I would go into the Agricultural complex near Flatwoods.
---
I didn't even consider Vendor Hopping as a method to get mods because of how horrifically RNG it is. I say this as a person that spent two weeks trying to get Calibrated Shocks for X-01 by Vendor hopping, failing to do so and taking advantage of the Steam Winter Sale instead of wasting time refreshing MODUS' vendor inventory.
---
Same here, I don’t get the hate, been playing since the Beta and have had a great time so far.
---
Maybe they will add a way to display bobbleheads and toys etc. I hope so. I would like to put some junk stuff in my camp.
---
 Lucky Hole Mine!
---
Thank you for commenting this, I was super confused why I was suddenly crashing when using my decon shower (I just got a leg tesla rifle)
---
Those are the only games they make? 
---
My favorite is running at them in pacifist with a melee weapon out to make them think i am about to fight back and they kill themselves.
---
Only with a southern draw, and a lack of schooling. 
---
So there's literally no reason to not bulk everything but acid... And even that's not a negative 
---
Dang i didnt know that! Photomode is one of my favorite things about this game. Ill have to keep that in mind 
---
Just waiting for the lazy prep bots to get the míssil ready. 
---
Dude its not that hard to manage your stash, first of all, there is no reason anyone should have over 100 pounds in weapons and armor in stash, they are probobly stuff they dont use often or dont even use, second, there are many resources that you collect that you dont need a bunch of in your stash, get rid of your 600+ cloth, your 300+ leather, your 300+ antiseptic, your 100+ wood, those ammo types you dont use, and any other resources your overflowing with by dropping or selling to vendors or other players, some resources are easy to get and/or dont use often so there is no reason to have tons of them, and eventually you will reach a point in the game where you start having more of something than you need, eventually you start having an overflow of radaways, stimpaks, springs, screws, and others, get rid of things clogging up your stash
---
THE front page? A front page? what?
---
He showed it last forever not just one hour why are you ignoring that.
---
Yes bobbleheads are stupid easy to find if you really look for them.
---
If you just relog once an hour you can keep and stack every single bobblehead you ever find.
---
This is not rocket science.
---
I'm not even sure what point you are trying to make with this.
---
I just found them at Watoga station. I’m level 82.
---
This might be an unpopular opinion, but as a PS4 player cross-platform might not be great where PvP is concerned.
---
As an example, I've seen videos of PC players in pip-boy and it looks like you can use mouse wheel to quickly scroll items? PS4 and Xbox players are stuck with d-pad tapping. 
---
I killed one with 5 caps today!
---
Gotcha, thanks for the help! 
---
My guess is that something linked to lasers is crashing your game. Your best bet would be to go on Bethesda.net to get some actual support instead of just sobbing here buddy.
---
If your connection allows it you could also try a redownload
---
Well the fault of oversight falls on you. White springs is not intended to be a low level zone. There are plenty or zones located in the forest region that cannot be nuked, and the ones that can don't get nuked. For whatever reason you choose to build your camp in or near a zone that constantly gets nuked. Yet- you travel without any mitigation against radiation. Also you didn't walk to some nearby area and break your stuff down or just drop it so you can fast travel. yes, poor oversight indeed but on your part. The game is working as intended. Next time plan ahead !
---
If you use the terminal in the front of fort defiance on the right-hand side you can register to use it and are given the gun. 
---
Play some hyperdimension neptunia?
---
I found a double shot level 5 10mm pistol. Think it’d be pretty fun for a lvl 5, maybe.
---
Yeah, it’s been bothering me since B.E.T.A. Finally got around to figuring it out for myself. 
---
The hopper bug is well known and most people just avoid it. 
---
Got a few tidbits of info for you, that method you just described was stealth patched, what would truly fix the issue is putting a weight limit on all world containers.
---
And there hasn’t been bans, players who have evidence against them if actively duping will get them banned. Not even a screenshot of an stacked inventory is enough because people come across leftover duped items all the time now 
---
It’s a PVP
---
Get out of here with not being able to shoot at people crap. 
---
It's by the tennis courts. There's a gazebo with a well in the middle and the water fountain is off to the side.
---
Dont forget to go to this cap selling sight, drop my name in the promo button and get a sick 2.5% off your total price. 
---
No prob. Thanks for input.
---
I can't speak for you but my two cents: you don't want one.  I got one with my first toon...Game got boring.  I dropped the weapon away from everything and hopped servers.  Game is fun again. 
---
I have 3 toons I play.  My melee char does not use legendary at all period. Melee is already legendary.  My pistol and rifle builds will use some like weight reduction etc.  My pistol build uses anti-armor and that feels balanced.
---
Until they balance the legendary weapons I just play with out most of them.  Trust me you can still do everything in the game without them.  And have a little challenge.
---
I'd just use another character?
---
Like yours second character &gt; her "bank of collectors"
---
That way you can just relog with the good character and her bears are saved
---
I think we all would, but I'm not optimistic. It would be nice to do it with all my power armors at least. 
---
Does this also mean that you can stack the SPECIAL bobbleheads too? Like can you do even more absurd damage (with only stacked str bobbleheads) with melee? Or crafting power armor with insane durability (stacked int bobbleheads)
---
On a side note I know this is already possible to some degree, like bloodied + nerd rage melee builds or 30+ int crafting. I’m wondering if stacking the bobbleheads can give you SPECIAL in the 100s
---
INCOMING!!
---
Where at
---
If that's what you took from it, maybe you should look a little closer at yourself. I'm just sharing sharing something I liked about the game. I'd rather hear more from others who do similar things than get kudos.
---
It's like the one true Rick said, "Always wait for permission to feel accomplishment."
---
Imagine a Mole rat or Radscorpion boss. 
---
You're a hero
---
Thank you for this! 
---
I just follow the quests for the most part
---
Thanks for the feedback. Will try to be less paranoid.
---
lmao hes just karma whoring at this point.
---
Once you've collected majority of the perks, you'll start having duplicates. You can keep different set of levels to help with customizing multiple builds.
---
And also if you havent already, definitely try using the Perk Manager Mod

---
I don't even want it to revive me. I understand the use of it because if you're being stormed by enemies you might take a few with you and clear the area with a dropped grenade. But as it currently stands, the grenade can damage you when you simply drop so you might as well have died in the first place.
---
My suspicion is there is a way to add TSE to weapons. This one cat dropped one of damn near every TSE weapon, a shotty, a .44, a gatlin, a tesla, a gause, the old ww1 gatlin, and many others, all 3 star TSE. I'm lvl 183, level up regularly through golf course nuke zone so I've had lots of legendaries drop but personally have only seen a single TSE dragon drop. Ever. Htf did this dude manage to get like 12 3* TSE weapons that they were even willing to just part with? Either way, something really fishy.
---
This game is fucking doodoo sometimes.
---
Basic programming bugs being thoroughly detailed and discovered by the community with no dev acknowledgement.
---
If this isn't fixed real soon I'm going to lose what little faith I have left in this game.
---
I've got the finest weapons and armor.
---
Agree. I logged off after vendoring one day and logged back in later, was at Whitesprings.  I was walking towards the doors to the resort then just died. No reason why. When I respawned I realized I was in a blast zone. Before I died there was no rad sound or cloudy, red sky. Not very fun.
---
Give it a shot. I find you can play it like a single player game as I rarely encounter other players.
---
Did you even find the code for that door? I spent a good bit of time and never found it.
---
posts like these are why people avoid this sub like the plague. you refuse to admit there's anything wrong with the game.
---
I did break my junk down, yet I was still overencumbered. and I spawned outside the Uranium Fever event location, my camp just happens to me near it (specifically so I can farm it). this could've happened with anyone, camp or no camp.
---
and unless there's a specific reason I'm missing, why do markers don't show up half the time when you die? because the other half I'm allowed to travel anywhere. seems like a bug to me.
---
What about T60?
---
Thank u I didn't kno..but disease cures are really easy to craft
---
And now 3 minutes later the server crashes and I'm getting constant "Server not Responding - Controls have been temporarily disabled". I think this is a good time to hang it up. Level 110 to the dust. 
---
I wanna say Welch Station... but I’m not 100%
---
You're missing the point.
---
They STACK.
---
So you can use 50000 of them to push your damage to infinity.
---
Which is where the dupers come in.
---
Killing with kindness... or axe? Or kindness? Or explosive? Hmmm...
---
It’s an incredible feeling to share stuff with your kids . We don’t get to see much of each other my daughters in the Navy stationed in the Middle East and my sons off to college. This game is a fun way to get connected and the time we did play was fun as hell. We where  running around the wasteland ,talking about family none sense and joking around whilst killing mole rats and scorched.... priceless .This is what we did on New Year’s Eve as a family. 
---
Well I did not know that. Maybe they should implement a time frame of attack (maybe 5 mins) and if the attack is not met both parties go neutral.
---
I've not seen any weapon plan but the Radium Rifle at Watoga station since hitting 45 either.
---
"I think everyone is in agreement with this" says the 0 point thread.
---
So you’re telling people to not do something because it ruins...their own experience?
---
I’m not disagreeing with you, it just seems like that’s a fairly self-explanatory lesson that they’ll figure out on their own.
---
Plus—again, neither disagreeing with you nor encouraging ‘sploitz—it could be that circumventing some of the core game loop lets them enjoy the game in other ways.
---
For example, when Elite Dangerous had that bug in calculating the value of passenger missions and I made 3 billion credits in an evening and bought myself a fully A-rated cutter, I actually started enjoying the game *more*. I never wanted to PvP, just wanted to cruise around the galaxy and not constantly focus on grinding on the exponential ship cost curve with linear income sources.
---
All I’m sayin’ is that if I didn’t have to farm for two hours each night to get two lever guns’ worth of screws so I can scrap them so I can maybe have a chance of getting a random mod unlock, but instead I could just hop around the map doing fun events and decorating my base...I wouldn’t mind that, you know?
---
How much can you get from this? My current farm takes about 10 mins for ~200 lead and steel
---
I could have lost my Stand Fast armor but I didn't click on it. It was a little troubling as I had heard about people losing things, but after wards I checked and it was still there. I have lost moods building stuff at workshops though. I don't know if that could be called user error as I don't think you get the pop up telling you what it uses at workshops. I don't want to test it to find out. Already lost a lot of T-51b mods. Nothing special but some i had been collecting and spent a bunch of caps on.
---
I've got 18 holotaps, just played them all and it still didn't complete for me... 
---
Yes those that demand don’t get much from me.
---
They do, use your mic or send a message. We cant expect for them to make a "Here, have some free shit" emote just because we are introverts.
---
also a food category would be nice..
---
Did you loot every last item from their lunch bag? 
---
TBH, the early game of 76 is the most magical.
---
Never having any stims, actually being afraid when you see a large group of enemies, ammo being an issue, etc. Finding stims in containers is a super cool feeling when you're that low cause it's like, "Phew, now I can survive my next encounter."
---
It gets to a point like every survival game where the 'survival' aspect is just a chore. No reason to take that away from a new player.
---
When I see level 20-35 dudes I'll often drop a little care package of ~20 stims, 20 purified water, and some cooked meat of whatever kind I have because I know those levels are a bit of a grind, but I wouldn't drop things to people below that level.
---
Ive always gotten the bounty showed 
---
True but sometimes I am in a hurry like in a nuke zone, I don’t have time to send them a message or chat.  A simple emote would be nice 
---
No shit they stack! That's what I'm saying. You can stack every single bobblehead you ever find. It's not just a problem for the dupers.
---
I don't know what your point is by trying to claim it's just a problem for duper's when I'm saying it affects everybody.  what is your point???

Games are about having fun... so by definition, you can't really be shit at having fun. What you can be shit at though... is choosing boyfriends.
---
I got the event to complete both times with plenty of time to spare. Gave me the thumbs up saying Event Complete. No Mirelurk queen to be seen anywhere. No rewards given after event complete notice.
---
You are responsible for everything that happens to you, and everyone else.
---
There are plenty of ways YOU can modify your bosses behavior, with the choices, relationships and history YOU have built.
---
Why didn't you just drop a frame with all the pieces on it next to them?
---
I have been playing on Xbox all weekend. I can’t count the number of times I've been kicked off this weekend. 
---
I am disappoint.
---
True. Sometime people are also in parties and cant hear you talking or you dont have time to message them because they are walking away. Are we still getting the in game chat? I heard some stuff about it before, nothing recently though. 
---
Good point, You could keep a list of who has been the players friend and keep track that way - give the bounty to the offended if a friend kills them
---
I was getting my low level friend raider power armor and I went to the junk yard where a set spawns. The workshop was already owned so i can't pick lock the door without getting a wanted status. So I took over the workshop and killed the lv 9 player who started to attack me.
---
I had the munitions factory this morning. While waiting for the next batch of shotgun shells, I looked at my Pip Boy to decide what to do next. I heard someone walk into the factory as the "Defend" event popped up so I didn't pay it much mind. Then I looked up and someone in PA one-shotted me with an explosive shotgun. No idea if it was 2-shot or not, but I definitely heard the explosion. I was in my own T60 PA at the time. Not sure what is sporting or enjoyable about this. He got a 62-cap bounty on his head and I just switched servers. I'm in this game to cooperate with people, not duke it out with them, especially when the playing field isn't level.
---
We don’t necessarily need an emote either.  Maybe an option to highlight the bag or something 
---
I had no idea this was an actual thing. 
---
So that’s where mine went
---
Like the waypoint thing in warframe. 
---
I tried the same thing at the spa. The host said to pick a room and a therapist would be with you eventually. Perhaps I didn’t wait long enough based on this thread, but no one came. 
---
Does 76 really feel like a game with longevity?
---
Ok, I agree with you but...you had no heavy weapon dmg perks, you also had no gunsmith perk.  You were running a melee build who picked up a heavy weapon already at 50% condition.  Get all the proper perks and I know for a fact things will change.  I've seen it myself. 
---
I don't think anyone would mind a tweek to heavy guns but your example is not a good one. Sorry not trying to be a jerk.
---
Marathoner does not work in PA
---
Oh boy. Early levels are rough for supplies. Get the Pharma farmer thing so you can search containers, that perk is worth it's weight in platinum, especially early game. As for locations, try to make it to charleston fire department. Theyve got a few chem containers and bathroom mirrors you can hit for some easy ones and it's filled with friendly protectrons to keep you safe. There's usually a random baddie in the bathroom but they're not particularly tough. Then once you have some stims to keep you alive hit Arktos Pharma, it's just south of morgantown. Looks like a bear face instead of a medical cross. That's my usual haunt if I get low.
---
Yeah, I think its just for the events liked, "Scorched Horde". This is never explicitly explained though. I also don't like how in most ways things you do don't affect the world. 
---
Yet still present 2 months later. If anything good came from this game, it's I'm gonna start a fresh FO4 run tonight. Maybe I'll check back in around summer time to see if this game has been fixed. 
---
i've got all 18, and it's still sitting there for me... 
---
I always keep at least 50-100 of lead, steel, and aluminum as a safety cushion to prevent this from happening until they fix it. 
---
As a Brit i must say that "learnt" looks better than "learned" to me. But I also pronounce it more with the "t" rather than the "ed" anyway.
---
Loading in now!
---
I did, thanks anyways though.
---
I don't think Bethesda is going to ban people based on item count. It's much easier to just look at the crash logs and just see who crashed the server and how. If they see that JimBob transferred 1000 boards and was moving legendaries into containers beforehand then it's pretty obvious who to ban. 
---
The issue is this is going to take time which is why bans happen in waves. We saw that last ban wave and there were all of these people claiming to be innocent. We'll see the same thing. 
---
Also, if someone happens to be banned for duping when they themselves didn't dupe. Well too bad because you're an idiot for keeping 10,000 bobbleheads or whatever else you got.
---
Actually, you should still bulk acid. It turns 10 acid to 15 in bulk form, for some reason. So theoretically, if you had the plastic, you could just craft infinite acid.
---
I don't do that, but I do bulk it.
---
By the scorched prefix, i hope you dont mean scorched killer’s because that is a reciever and so you obviously cant stack with it with a prime, if you mean zealot’s then that effect should only apply to scorched and not scorchbeasts, but im sure zealot’s and a prime reciever stack against scorched, im gonna assume they stack through multiplication
---
I'll say this till I'm blue in the face; the server is not lagging, YOU (the client) are. 
---
There is NO proof that tons of items weighing in thousands of pounds have ANY stress on the server. If that player had only 1 of every item in that inventory it would cause the same exact lag. The problem comes from the game not being able to draw that many unique items quickly that causes the client to stop responding which causes the server to kick them. This is NOT user error however, this is Bethesda having poor optimization (if any) for the users client. Even if they came out tomorrow with 4 times the physical servers and 8 times the speed to them, it would still result in this problem of the client dying.  
---
This has been an issue since Oblivion, but no game till 76 had to potentially draw 24 different inventories with so many unique items. This is another legacy bug like the framerate that was patched that not many people would ever really run into till 76 came out.

I loved the laser doors in the brotherhood base which do not allow the player but allow ghouls and other enemies to pass through.

You should build above the bridge so you don't have super mutants invade every time you zone in.
---
So we agree then
---
It's bullying when the attacker is 200+ levels higher and can one shot the workshop owner before they even realize they are under attack.
---
Do you know if anyone has tried using marsupial to jump on top of it after the silo opens?
---
I'd like an account-wide stash to transfer items between my characters without needing another person. They could also make it safe against auto-scrapping, and in fact that'd probably make it easier to implement.
---
Yes exactly.  We need waypoints for teams too so we can mark locations and such

Don't spam

Almost level 80 just got an explosive rifle so I'm about to be maxing out demo as well.

Very helpful, thanks!
---
Thanks.. I'll keep farming and keep my fingers crossed I guess. If I find all the pieces I'm soo gonna craft it for everyone who provides the mats for it 
---
Nope,, im usually a Tramp and i will take your screws from paper bags, but this guys stuff was more satisfying having him know his Junk was worthless to me,,,, he had 4 titanium scraps wich i could have probably done with though :)
---
Same :/ friend of mine had a friend with the owl mask and a couple others but I don't think he thought to ask at the time where they got em. :/
---
It’s not up to anyone to dictate how much of anything anyone should have. Games that have this theory of dictating every decision you do usually don’t last long because gamers want freedom, particularly in an open world game like this. This game should cater to everyone, that includes hoarders, not with an unlimited stash size but a massive increase, 600 is laughable dude.
---
The game doesn’t even run smoothly at the best of times, crashes often. Are you going to blame my console and internet too? Because it’s the same analogy. It comes back to Bethesda not giving a damn about their game.
---
The last bit of bans we saw were on PC and related to cheat engine, no one on consoles.
---
Yeah i don't server hop when over encumbered because of this.
---
I drop junk then port home
---
Where do you get the plans to make the serums? Or is it the same vendor that sells the serum and I just missed it?
---
Yes that should be addressed, it should not be overly difficult to add a condition to deal with that.
---
&gt; also therefore should have at least 2K caps to by any flavor of TSE weapon.
---
Fuck that my man. What's the point of even playing the game if you just buy a god roll gun?
---
That's as boring as buying shit off the real money AH when Diablo 3 launched.
---
You can only stack the same bobblehead.you can only have one head effect,like chems,magazine...
---
Stop worrying about something you never experienced. 
---
I use this trick since i have the curator perk and it's something truly exploitable only by serial dupers.
---
Audio is a little low on my end, I had to turn youtube way up.
---
Otherwise, for me, good to have proof to accompany the "should be" comments.
---
Thanks mate, appreciate it
---
Kind of a weird reason to stop playin 
---
She accidentally scrapped several of then while making some armor, she thought she was outnof raw cloth but she had a stack of 5 bulk cloth still in her stash. I assumed that if raw or bulk was available it would pull from that first.
---
Good one! LoL
---
He can play the game. He just wants it dumbed down so at a low level he can live in a high level zone.
---
Sb's are doing exactly what they are intended to do
---
You do lose a bit of mobility in power armor. But you can cancel it out with some movement speed perks (gun runner and squad maneuvers) or the speed demon mutation. Pretty sure your slower with a weapon out as well unless you have gun runner and a pistol
---
Didn't know about that! Thanks for the heads up
---
Thanks all, much fun.
---
Gotcha. So you're just pissed he's trying to get your exploit fixed.
---
It’s the BOS paint for it bro 
---
Hoarding doesn't crash the game. It's just 1s and 0s. The method peoiple use to dupe does crash the game. Anyway I made a short video to show I'm almost at 1000 without perks. I know I can sell or get rid of some o this stuff and I will but it's completely normal for a lot of people to collect armor sets and weapons with different effects, consumables, etc.
---

Thats a good point! I’ll see how she feels about that
---
Try logging out and back in the fix the arm glitch.
---
You sure you scrapped the right frame?  Can't really tell them apart in the inventory screen.  Might have scrapped the ultracite?
---
Lol I always thought it was because I rapid fire the skip dialogue button after the first time hearing a story. This makes more sense though
---
Yeah... Baseline, they suck pretty hard, but even with just Luck of the Draw, repaired to 200% with Weapon Artisan, they last exponentially longer.
---
Live the dream man! Maybe Bethesda will lose money so they can support a soulless cash grab. This game is too big to fail. They only went all in on a game that has become a member because of how hilariously bad it is.
---
I'm lvl 70 plus so if you want I can help you
---
i like to give out fully upgraded vault suits and 10mm pistols with all the good mods
---
Scap ( not store) and rebuild it. Fixed it for me.
---
Because there was little to no QA for this game, and it's a super basic programming bug.
---
I did a site Charlie run last night by myself.
---
The entire time through the silo the server kept giving me the server not responding message.
---
Every time I crouched every time I stood up every time I tried to do anything I got the server not responding notice.
---
When I'm out playing the game normally I never ever get that warning. Almost the entire time I was in the solo I kept getting it and thought I was going to disconnect it any moment.
---
I finally did get to launch the nuke and explore the nuke Zone without crashing so it all worked out in the end. 
---
It was a night vision scope mod for the gun.
---
Lever action plans can be rarely bought at Grafton station.
---
I have two characters, one is 53, and the other is 78... I literally just got my first marine armor plans last night on my 78 as a quest reward from a random enclave quest.

---
Should have done the finger guns 
---
Really? So many times have i been in a nuke zone at blast, spent some time fighting some baddies, only to see the fauna go back to normal as soon as the radiation decipates and color is restored. The enemies are still effected, but i generally only see nuked flora at the beginning of the nuke.
---
Ive yet to actually hunt for flora, but the mechanics ive witnessed always made me feel as though gathering up what i need within the first 15 min of touch down would need to be priority.
---
1 fuck urself  2 BETHESDA should do a WEEKLY MAINTENANCE for SERVER STABILITY  like every other mmo
---
Depends on your platform, on PC if you take a photo, it gets saved into My Documents &gt; My Games &gt; FO76 &gt; Photos. Not sure about ps4 or xbox.
---
Sounds like region-locking is the solution.
---
It’s disappointing not being able to hoard supplies if that’s your playstyle. I usually like to hoard everything just in case. Sometimes I like to change play styles and use a different gun or armor. 
---
In this game I like to hoard up to give to my friends. I play way more than they do and like to give them ammo and supplies so we don’t need to spend an hour farming low level enemies at the start just so we can do one or two missions. It’s just tedious to play with such a limit.
---
I also accidentally picked up someone else’s junk who had hundreds of everything. Now I spend a few hours each day farming plastic, bulking, traveling to vendors and then managing the rest of my stash so I can get something out of it. It’s basically a No Man’s Sky level of storage management. 
---
I also regularly try to give stuff to lower level players but that can be tedious as well. 
---
I do the same
---
That was hilarious and the confusion someone would have would be great especially if they just got the game.

Illegal in what country?

Out of all the modern Fallout games, I feel 76 is the second best for the RP aspect. My camp is set up as an Enclave outpost.

The community should hear about these things. It can help shape the way the community handles itself going forward and help keep this from being another toxic game.
---
Alloyed metal chest is 25 / 20
---
There are few problems with this.
---
1) The higher your level, the more caps you lose when you die
---
2) The caps you earn are split amongst your team and again it depends on the level of the person you kill
---
3) When the people you are killing run out of caps they do get a debuff but it doesn't stop them from doing anything
---
The result is that the person of the highest level and most PvP activity will end up funnelling his caps to his own teammates. Essentially the person who makes the most caps is the person who dies the least on your team. Which is usually the person contributing the least.
---
For example you may experience this: Kill +5 caps, Kill +5 caps, Kill +5 caps, Kill +5 caps, Kill +5 caps, Die -135 caps, seek revenge +40 caps. Repeat. 
---
The money you lose goes to the other team. You then kill them in revenge but that money is split between your team. So even if you have a 5.0 K/D you can still lose money... To your own team. 
---
You really just want to be a dick online don't you?
---
As i told you it's not fing easy to find the bobblehead you want.
---
Also 1 hour is short! You're fighting the queen and the hour is gone,you're in a nuke and the hour is gone. Do you drop a queen fight to refill the timer? 
---
Can you see why this is not such big deal?
---
Not as much as the infinite weight of two weeks ago( which i'm 90% sure you used).
---
If they patch it,cool,at least i won't have to relog every hour. 
---
Marine armor has a few guranteed spawn locations that spawn a random Marine plan. What I know of is: NAR repair yard (west of Watoga), abandoned train car (unmarked, between Watoga and NAR), treetops (near the top, located north of Camp Venture), and Harper's Ferry (in the house that has a train car going through it, in a display case on the second floor)
---
Yeah. There's also no reason to bulk anything except for Lead and Aluminum. Unless you need to bulk it to sell it. Only Lead and Aluminum reduce weight.
---
This is good information for new players.  The "take off" to the info was a little slow but the video was direct to the point.  Thanks for the info.
---
There’s an actual spring tap @ the greenbrier in the gazebo looking thing too.  It’s literally the source of the logo.  Water is stinky and terrible but I have a sip every time I’m there haha. 
---
I just got the plans for the Ultracite Gatling Laser and the Prime receiver. It is very underwhelming  :/  Less than 30 damage with all 3 heavy gun cards at level 3. What do you get?

Well done lads

What system do you play on?

String bet
---
Idk, maybe my internet is better or my PS4 is cleaner. I reset that shit every six months or so and it seems to help a lot.
---
On console, you hold X (place button) and it let's you move it around
---
still seems like the only things worth bulking are lead and aluminum.
---

It may work to some extent. Noticed my fusion cores down to 1,4 in stash when I equip batteries included

Have a wank?

dont some things require more or less than 2 plastic to bulk?

There are NPCs ingame. Just no human NPCs.

 Its in the third shack, the one closest to the mine. It really does not matter, there's not much behind the door. 
---
 The hidden passages are key. There are two of em'. 
---
Well, I think your focus on encumbrance is different than the topic of discussion here being duping. No one is suggesting encumbered players should be banned, but dupers should, and a reliable method for catching them would be focusing on people with egregious amounts of rare items, not just people with a lot of stuff in general.
---
I disagree that abusing a bug is okay, and stand by my statement that intentionally abusing bugs should be a bannable offense.
---
All that being said, I see the point you're making about the innocent being impacted by sweeping bans targetting exploiters being a danger for any action designed to address the issue. I would rather see them focus on only egregious cases (hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads, for example) and take no action on cases where it may be harder to tell if an exploit was used (hundreds of thousands of a scrap item). I definitely don't agree with solutions like "reset everyone" or "ban anyone over x encumbrance".
---
The game IS a buggy mess, and fixing the issues caused by this will be difficult, if not impossible. I understand your perspective, even if I don't agree with it. 
---
These people can't be changed. D-bags will always be D-bags.
---
I fought off mutants there for about half an hour today.
---
Half the time I get scorch beasts that are friendly for some reason yellow health bar, follows me, and won’t attack me
---
Worked for me every day this week. Just have to be patient sometimes.
---
Honestly even if we just got these little quick texts instead of a chat option, I would be ok with thattoo. .
---
Where's this ammo factory?
---
Thank you, I’m on PC, but I held E and fixed it.
---
Nothing. 
---
VATS still works good for me. I just had to change my strategy with it.
---
I used to use it to slow things down and carefully pick out my shots, especially when I was hidden and sniping and being careful. Now, it's more like using targeting lock-on in a Zelda game, so you don't need to aim while dodging and moving. Instead of using it while hiding and sniping, I use it when lots of enemies are rushing at me and I need to move fast without worrying about my aim.
---
It's an adjustment, but I've come to like it.
---
Nah man, fundamental difference is that I wouldn't be ashamed to admit that I watch Tom &amp; Jerry reruns.
---
"I fart in your general direction!"
---
I always forgot about that then I realise that I have 30 missiles and 10 mini nukes
---
THANKS!
---
This happens to me quite a bit. No matter where I’m at. I’ll just walk up to an area full of enemies and the all fall over dead.

---
If you want one quick the best bet would be to buy one. Since your on PS4 you should find (depending on what exactly your looking for) fairly cheap now since they've been duped massively. 
---
Although I will say that they make the game pretty stale. As far as where I farm, I don't. Farming specific spots made the game boring and burned me out pretty quick. Once I went back to just exploring and doing events I had a much better time and still get some pretty good loot every once in awhile.
---
And no, this isn't promoting duping. This is giving the clearest and most honest answer to OP. 
---
It is..I just bought it with atoms I got from missions. I think the others are as well.
---
If PvP were fun, nobody would be complaining.
---
This fanbase for some reason blames players instead of designers, which to me is a clear signal that Bethesda doesn't need to learn from mistakes.
---
If you have crops or resource deposits, they can be stolen. 
---
Not trying to be a dick trying to figure out what point you're making.
---
You claimed it only affects dupers. I say it affects everybody.
---
by you claiming it only affects dupers are you trying to say it shouldn't be fixed and we should just let it go ? I don't understand the point you're trying to make.
---
What point are you trying to make by saying it only affects dupers???
---
The camo paint IS atom buyable, I just bought it yesterday.
---
My father and I bonded over Madden football almost 20 years ago, and they’re some of my fondest memories we shared as adults! Great job
---
Have any bloodied melee?
---
yep scaped 16 hardened mass just 20 minutes ago i was mother f this, mother f that,,,, FU TODD!!!!!
---
Mostly duping, it's insanely rare to loot. If you want one buy it from trading subs but 90% are dupe being sold for full price even thought they are worthless. Also heard some discord servers straight up giveaway bunches of TSE for anyone.
---
There’s a bug where if you die overencumbered sometimes you won’t be allowed to resplendent anywhere, it really does suck.
---
So were you activating the crits as they became available?  I guess you must have or we wouldn't constantly hear the crit bleep.
---
Very impressive.  I think a combination of 4 leaf clover + using it correctly, maybe a bit of tenderizor, in combination with the automatic weapon.
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
I was playing around with vats on my stealth sniper last night and I can't get the big hits like you do in vats.  I can get better damage with my non-auto rifle outside of vats, just manually aiming for heads/legs/vulnerable areas.  I don't think I can pull off manual aim on a sb though.
---
Duping is pathetically easy, and the stack of items doubles every time so they can quickly amass a huge stockpile. There are plenty of shitbags out there with hundreds or thousands of TSE weapons.
---
I have a lot of time spent on my character, plenty of rare recipes and items, and I'd happily lose it all in a mass inventory wipe, if it meant the duped items were removed from the 'economy' as well.
---
Add a lock ability like doors?
---
I mostly use it when running and dodging, since it keeps my aim locked on the entire time, allowing me to focus on evasion instead of aiming.
---
If you change the title from ".44 weapons" to "everything that isn't TSE" then I'll agree with you. We have far too few viable weapons in the game. I don't want to be pigeonholed into playing TSE\_loadout\_01 and using power armour but really, there are so few weapons worth using.
---
Sounds like you would be a good player to hang around with on 76. Unfortunately I have a PC.
---
It would be nice if Beth could somehow figure out to do the cross platform thing.
---
Only downside is the untold billions of plastic that you will need.
---
I got lever rifle from there which was great, then crossbow...not so great, then no weapon plans for a while 
---
Any sledgehammers or super sledges?
---
How much does 2 molded plastic weigh?
---
Aren't some of those numbers so tight that not bulking is nearly the same?
---
How
---
My game just crashed, so I'll let you know.
---
Now if we could only turn off generators....
---
oh well speak of the devil my game disconnected again. I’ll check my wifi connection.
---
K thx
---
No I never used the weight exploit. I've never used any exploit. I actually enjoy playing this game the way it should be played. 
---
You're clearly an exploiter because you just assume everyone else is.
---
I don't think this ruins the games at all, but shows how the duplication glitch is ruining another cool aspect of the game and highlights another bugged perk. Like even your story of getting 179 of the same bobble head, which I'm sure took a lot more effort than you lead on to, is awesome that it was able to pay out and give you numbers like that! Its a nice reward and something that could be fun to play with for the hour or so that its intended!
---
However thanks to the duplication glitch and the perk giving you another hour like you said, it just breaks the fun when people are running around with 1000 of them on and potentially forever. I feel like the weight of the bobble heads/magazines and the fact that they stack is what they need to actually be viable to use in the first place. Otherwise we will continue to see posts of people just throwing them away or selling them.
---
Yeah I’m playing different games now, and just waiting till the game becomes playable and fun. 
---
“OW ARM HURT!”
---
If you have enough lead to bulk, you have enough lead to craft ammo.
---
In the case of the spa, eventually means never.
---
Its always a 50/50 Ill join a server and be stable all day or join a server and know someones duping due to how absolutely trash its running.
---
I defend my junk harvester. Only thing in my base behind a locked door 
---
My photos never save or delete I think my game is bugged. I have one photo from my first character that I took in vault 76 and I can’t delete it. Whenever I take another snapshot it doesn’t save to my gallery. :/ 
---
Mkay bye
---
Don't play in pc personally is control tab supposed to back you up to the main menu? 
---
my game just now crashed, I had just taken grafton steel yard and gorge junkyard. this is ridiculous
---
Shit sorry xbox. 
---
Fantastic job! Have an imaginary internet point!
---
Its easy to farm, id keep 50 on hand if you need to repair you PA or something
---
Yes ! I mean if they want to do a multiplayer game, at least they could do the cross platform! 
---
Very nice turnout! How I like to see it!
---
I'm down might need to craft some ammo first 
---
You know what... I’m not sure about that, I wasn’t paying attention to the plastic required. I know in smelting some required more acid but I haven’t noticed it in bulking. The point of the post was all things (minus 1) do save weight. 
---
Ahh, cheers mate, was worried about making it too loud
---
If bulking saves weight on everything but one... 
---
Hmm okay 
---
it's used to upgrade the BOS underarmor 
---
That’s rough. Luckily I haven’t had any bad things happen to me yet, knock on wood. 
---
Did the same thing on New Years!!
---
I've got a TSE Dragon, TSE laser rifle, TSE combat shotgun, TSE Gauss rifle, TSE black powder rifle, and a TSE double barrel.
---
I haven't dupped, I haven't cheated, I have just run across people that have given them to me. I just hit level 102 and I like to find randoms at the level of the gun and give said gun to them for free.
---
However I never turn down 10mm ammo when asked if I would like anything. If people want them, I give it. It is how it should work imho
---
Even though I’m a highish level, I still have no idea what hardened mass and flux do, what is the purpose of them?
---
RUN AWAAAAAAY
---
"Drama"
---
Profit if you can kill them destroying your base
---
You are fine. There's plenty of time, after we run the queen we are probably going to nuke whitesprings next. 
---
Play with me I font care about friendlyness 
---
Thats illegal to ban credit account nd psn account quit being a sjw npc 
---
Are you using a low health build? If you are radicool in END could be a big boost to damage. Also if you’re killing things quickly, suppressor is unnecessary. You could use those 3 points for party boy and drink whisky for +6 strength 
---
Definitely.
---
I saw this the other day and was quite impressed! Too bad molerats were devouring his house :(
---
Nearly. 2 Molded plastic is 0.060 pounds. Every little bit helps when most of us are starved for space. Plus the selling to vendors makes it a good bet. IMO
---
/u/Penthesilean /u/Gizmoidal
---
I will first give you my STAT spread and then explain my perk choices. I will preface this with the fact I do not wear power armor. I find it clunky and not really conduscive to a proper pistol build wear power armor lends itself more to larger and slower weapons.
---
9, 6, 5, 1, 5, 15, 15
---
**9 STR**
---
Barbarian 3
---
At 9 STR, Barbarian gives us 36 bonus DR even when naked or in Hazmat.
---
Travelling Pharmacy 3
---
To carry all your Stimpaks, Radaway, and what have you. Also helps fill out the STR points.
---
Sturdy Frame 2
---
Because by level fifty you'll either be in full combat or marine armor.
---
Bandolier 1
---
Because cutting ammo weight by 45% is great.
---
**PER 6**
---
6 Perception gives us a decent chance to hit in VATS.
---
FOCUS FIRE 3. 
---
Get this perk ASAP. Being able to cycle bodyparts in VATS is a godsend. Being able to increase VATS accuracy and Damage with each shot is even better.
---
CRACK SHOT 3
---
I carry two Western Revolvers. One is scoped for sniping and the other just has stock sights. The scoped pistol constantly has a 95% hit chance in VATS even at the very edge of my range.
---
**END 5**
---
Ironclad is all you need. This now brings our base DR to 86 and our base ER to 50. Don't need high HP if you stack defenses and also stay mobile.
---
**CHA 1**
---
Nothing really necessary in Charisma. Take a semi useful perk like Quack Surgeon to save your stimpaks.
---
No low health, full health in PA
---
Yes I love how kind other players are. Yesterday I was trying to craft the prototype power armor but didn't have enough materials and a level 186 came and gave me a bunch of materials and I was able to craft all of it.
---
Where do you find them? I used to get so many at low levels but literally nothing at all now. 
---
Pain train is a must for PA melee builds!!!!
---
On my way, level 154 melee
---
If you're wanted or PvPing then your base defenses can have more use. Though defenses use so much budget, you can hardly get enough to defend from a few Supermutants. Defenses at workshops are better as you can have much more budget. That's why I like building at workshops.
---
Another thing I've noticed in that with a semi-auto firing in quick succession the mob's health will drop then heal right back up!  Not legendary mobe, either.  Perhaps a bug with regular semi-auto similar to what I've heard was happening with explosive legendaries.
---
I need to make a video clip of it.  It's happened to me tons of times and a few times I've caught it on stream.
---
I get where you’re coming from. Your TSE feels earned because you didn’t cheat to get it. That’s valid. I think, for the health of PvP in 76, it would have been better that Bethesda didn’t allow for those two S tier effects to be combined/added with one another.
---
It appears you are out of loose pieces of metal, and only have a couple of neat stacks tied up with plastic cord left. Would you like to break down your gauss rifle to finish crafting this .50 cal ammo?
---
I just use a hazmat suit as I’m a stealth sniper and unless something physically runs into me I remain unseen.
---
I pick up everything i find, i actually use four weight reduction perks, the only things i actually drop are plans i already know and ammo i dont need, i play 4+ hours a day, doesnt matter if you are a hoarder or not, you dont need to put 20 missles or mini-nukes in your stash. Want to use a fat man? Fine, craft those mini-nukes when you decide you want to use a fat man and then use them, but you dont need to hold them in your stash, if you are hoarder then i am sure you have the resources to craft them. Just saying i have 140ish pounds of flux in my stash and three power armor sets, a few legendary weapons, my gunpowder, and my resources, i dont have stash problems and i never have resource problems
---
Good to know! I know i bulked steel lead and aluminum as i heard those were worth it.
---
But now more can be added to my list.
---
Thanks for this and the clarity of it.
---
Dupers flooded the market months ago, so if you buy one it’s most likely a duped one.
---
You can also do this to people who arent fighting you. That's why i always say there's more potential in pacifist griefing than trying to grief by fighting everyone
---
Not only can you stop them from shooting anything, they cant loot, use vendors/workbenches etc. If you stay in their face in passive 
---
So 4chan still a thing?
---
You can’t sell ammo
---
Most other Energy weapons work fine. I’ll admit that sometimes the auto laser rifle doesn’t work either but other than that I haven’t had any problems with them
---
First time I ever did the nuke mission I got disconnected after about an hour in there, had to start all over. I can live with the disconnects, but atleast put me back where I was... 
---
I would love a ham radio. Also, why the hell weren't the red wall stars available for our camps. 
---
Yeah you can, but you either have to buy the mods themselves, buy the plans or learn the plans from scrapping normal (non legendary) versions of the weapon.
---
Equip the perk to search for extra meds. Go into public bathrooms and unlike real life you'll come out with disease cures.
---
Bathroom mirrors are great for them. 
---
Wow...this is end game?  Server hopping a million times for a deep pocket mod.
---
Seriously though, thanks for the legwork.  I saw this armor and got the mask I think from the queen.  Hopefully they change this barrier to accessing this armor a bit.
---
Xbox one x 
---
Gt is eddie the fink
---
Yes I would think, as there's no (no power armor) suffix. Pick it up if you wish however the card won't work until they fix it of course
---
Exactly ppl are little bitches betcja the poster is a pc player sjw 
---
If you have a unique resource generator there can be things in there, or water in purifiers or crops that need to be harvested. 
---
Other than that you just have to rebuild, which costs next to nothing and I’ve done a few times now. Doesn’t bother me when someone attacks, it just means I have to repair when I stop back at home base. 
---
Or you could pick up camp and it repairs itself. 
---
Yes that vendor has that serum recipes under notes but the spawn rate is like 0.1%  :/     
---
How I got them? I could buy marsupial &amp; twisted pretty early, sold the serums for 1.5k each. I made a lot of caos with only those two because not much people sold serums at this point. Then I took the caps to buy weapons as reward for friends who server hopped for me. Some I just paid in caps. That way I got like 14-15 different recipes. For the last recipes I offered 2 spare recipes each to make sure I'll find a willing trader soon.      
---
      
---
And then I built Mut-A-Stop and started my business :D
---
Jesus christ, you cretin, do you not realise that dupers currently rule the marketplace?
---
Where on EARTH do you think the supply comes from?
---
Which, as you said, can then last forever.
---
It didn’t seem like OP was complaining about dying in a nuke zone, but not being able to respawn at all after dying and losing his junk because of that. 
---
That’s an actual bug in the game. OP had no control over that and didn’t plan to die overencumbered and get no option to respawn ANYWHERE. There hasn’t been anything wrong with people calling out bugs in the game any other time, and as such the complaint is a valid one.
---
Bloodied Golf Club
---
Totally guilty of botching about Preston &amp; Marcy ... I do miss the human NPCs so I guess I’m today years old as well!
---
4 times now I'm just minding my own business shopping in the Whitesprings Mall and I get hit from behind in mellee. Turn around and it's someone right near my level. OK whatever. But look at that guy twice my level in full power armor and massive assault cannon of death barely trying to hide around the corner! I wonder if the first guy is bait. 
---
4 times now I've just dumped or sold off all my junk so said "fuck it" and took the bait. It's just garbage anyway. I know I'm going to get cut in half with machine gun fire in a second but man, is it ever satisfying to smash in the bait's face and try to get a grenade or 2 off before it happens. 
---
Once, I watched one guy  (the trigger man) get out of power armor before trying their trick. This character is a pretty small lady. Guess they didn't realize that she is speced at 15 Strength with high armor penetration and one hand mellee damage. 
---
Honestly, these are some of the most actually somewhat exciting moments I've been having. 
---
I know its a trap. You must know I know. Can I manage to get out of it? So far, I guess I'm 1 for 4. 
---
In the patch before Christmas they fixed the plasma guns hit detection and I think the durability, been a big fan of the plasma gat since launch and now it actually kills things without breaking
---
I think part of the issue is a lot of weapons at the moment are terrible in their base form and require perks to get them up to an acceptable standard. Compare that to melee weapons which feel great in their base form and because awesome after perks.
---
I wish Bethesda could re-balance all the weapons feel as satisfying as swinging a Sledgehammer.
---
It’s Grahm.
---
Grahm loves to trade, Graham sounds like a douchebag
---
Any lever action rifle or laser weapons
---
This happens to me on Xbox all the time
---
I had no chance to test it and it was a hassle to get that many bobbleheads from like 50+ players so I won't try it again. But I would appreciate if someone tests other bobbleheads &amp; magazines too.
---
I have the plans for the arms and the tactical helmet if you’d like to trade just pm me 
---
Is it additive or multiplicative? As in, if you use a bobblehead, then use a second one, does it add 20% of your current damage, or is it like weapon damage mods that just adds 20% more of your base? I guess my question is: do you get exponential benefits from stacking multiple bobbleheads?
---
Lol I has it worse I was level 12 and went to belching Betty all the scorched we're level 20+ and even some level 40s and 60s but luckily I had a shotgun and just kept camping and recycling it. Took forever though.
---
Thank you dude, I was searching for the same type of video without the 10 minute bullshit 
---
So funny that i have way more problems with 76 than i do on Rdr2
---
That could be true lol, some comments here made me really confused... but I figured I can ignore those :D
---
Failed! There was just me and two other guys. 
---
I guess the look is so bad that no one wants the queen any more. 
---
I heard that whole thing in Nick's voice.
---
I left my 50 in the sack at whitesprings because I’m a rifle build and have a 3 Star ripper for melee when needed.
---
I don’t get the hype for all rise tbh.
---
Happened to me as well. I only had excavator armor and one day I logged in and there were 2 sets of it. 
---
Ok im BoneCollec7er56
---
Click the 3 dots in the top right on the main 76 page(?) And it should say "change user flair" gives  a bunch of options.
---
Great ideas, especially for helping newer players
---
Oh? I was out of town for that patch and I guess I could’ve missed the patch notes on that. Maybe I’ll take mine out of storage and give it a try 
---
Have you farmed for some legendaries? Have you fought the scorchbeast queen?
---
The best is to watch this and the trade subs for posts because people will hold him. That's how I got him last time and was able to relog to get stuff.
---
Did you read the accompanying notes?
---
You didn't mention any of that in your post though. I'm with the first guy. Fuck this post. The information is out there.this gets asked 50 times a day
---
Don't forget gambling with caps that you buy the deep pocket mod for limbs and not the deep pocket mod for chest :D
---
Xbox, psn, pc?
---
no worries, just wanted to make sure it wasn't on xbox or ps4 before I got excited XD do you know if the barn plans are for the building set, or the power conduits?
---
Yes! You can craft it at an armor bench. 
---
(I think)
---
Sorry. I'm on Xbox.
---
Wasn't real.
---
How many caps are you selling it for?
---
I started them in my mid 20s and they werent that difficult just had to fight some deathclaws.
---
Which "spec" is that perk card under?
---
Is there anything you can do with spare ammo? I noticed you can't sell ammo and it takes up too much space in my stash.
---
I've started just dropping it at my front door and hoping someone that needs it can find it lol 
---
By that I mean I have a few of each.
---
Happened to me to, I fast travelled to vault 76 to fix it. When it loaded I walked forward and was instantly transported back to my camp with no clothes on, no power armour and no shotgun. Reloaded into a new server and my 3 star explosive shotgun gone forever...
---
Building, the pretty red walls. I’ll probably scrap my current walls for these
---
Jesus Christ, this community is so toxic. I'm glad I don't frequent this sub.
---
Any two shot explosives?
---
Ok ok I get that but still I felt cheated out of a good game
---
I'll second that. Bunch of good folks enjoying the game at our own pace.
---

---
Thank you we are halfway through the silo now
---
I made an alt as i wasn't on board with leveling 30 times for special respecs and another 30 for perk cards.
---
At level 120 that is a waste of time.
---
I agree. It’s crazy watched people fire a shotgun once in WS nuke zone and watch a horde of lvl 58 diseased bloated glowing ones all drop. While I’m using everything under the sun short of the kitchen sink. Granted I’m 42 but can hold my own. 
---
Exactly .. plus you don't waste caps taking it over or fighting for it, I lost at least 100 caps once trying to defend it  (my first and last time), but you know, it was mine .. and then it was not .. lesson learned .. now I don't bother at all, much more efficent farming a mineral deposit at your camp unless you want the plans and small rewards.
---
It's not a single pieces, it's a complete set bonus. 
---
You cannot recraft anything from that questline without the original. It lists the original as a component to craft an upgraded version. The only way to get another is to buy one form anothe player or make an alt and trade it back to your main.
---
It’s a rare one by comparison to other weapons. Some vendors sell plans for it. Phoenix in Watoga shopping plaza sells plans.
---
I bought my plans from the R&amp;G station.
---
The receiver mods are a little wonky on them, too. For whatever reason, the hardened receiver doesn’t do the most damage like on other guns. Instead, the refined receiver seems to be the best🤷🏼‍♂️ I think it’s a bug
---
Check the Data or Radio tabs of your pipboy

I was going "It's time for lunch" but true 
---
I know of the one near the door. There's another?
---
I had the same 3 times last night .  Also froze while fast traveling 
---
I've run into maybe three Flatwoods monsters and two mothmen while being reasonably exploratory and getting close to level 110 since beta.  The last one I got was yesterday while walking the tracks between Harper's Ferry and Berkeley.  (Ironic because I'd just commented the day before that I hadn't seen one in ages.)  Unfortunately it turned into an unlootable asp pile.  From past experience, I vaguely recall the loot being pretty unremarkable aside from the wings yielding one unit each of ultracite scrap.  The corpse turns into an ash pile, so there's no real benefit to documenting your kill for posterity.  I've made a habit of being a 19th century big game hunter and taking a minute to pose with every scorchbeast I've killed starting at my first at level 35.  (that was a grueling, protracted battle near the Charleston FD that broke all my armor and caused me to suck down stimpaks, which is where I learned to equip white knight.)
---
From the lore I've been reading throughout the game, they more will likely be the location of a raid type boss that will be way tougher than the scorch beast queen. I am thinking it will be something along the lines if drawing out or finding the hive mind for the scorched. I feel the tentacles all around the mire are linked to this hive mind and this will be a boss of some type in the future.
---
Neat :)

If all the bottom walls are destroyed, does the tower fall?

Mats for making mats for high level armor and such.

---
Game just crashed a second time. Will update you when back in.
---
Why’s that? 
---
Put it at the overseers camp instead in the stash for newbies instead, bags despawn ..
---
I have a cowboy build. Pistols and a level action only. The single action is my favourite gun but damn is it bad. It needs an edge over the other revolvers to make it worth while - beyond being able to shoot to interrupt the reload. If it had amazing hip fire and comparable damage to the western then it would be worthwhile to use it
---
The post says I’m looking for one...

Not with my bandolier

I would love winterized for x01 or even have it make t 51b super durable/neigh unbreakable like in fallout 3
---
&gt;There’s a bug where if you die overencumbered sometimes you won’t be allowed to resplendent anywhere, it really does suck.
---
&gt;That’s an actual bug in the game.
---
Thanks for the tip! Will get on that as soon as I finish my base. I'm only Level 17 but I've amassed a shit ton of weapons and armor that I can't even use until level 30-50.
---
Right.. I’m sure it went down just like that. Lol..
---
Toastnugget25 if you're on ps4. I'll help you out man I'm not super high but 48 now and could definitely help ya out a bit 
---
oh, ok any chance of a video or image proof. So It can be put here. [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/291205/taming-pacifing-and-you?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=1](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/291205/taming-pacifing-and-you?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=1)  
---
Actually I think you should post that info here. 
---
230+ hours and I have an explosive 10mm. Not 2 shot. But im ok with that. I dont want every battle to be so easy. 
---
Hahahahahahahaha yes this happens to my friends all the time lol 
---
Stalk people.  Don’t attack them, just follow them everywhere.
---
Find new players and help them out.
---
Farm events and sell the plans and legendaries (I don’t sell or trade but it could be something).
---
Get every addiction you can and get a junkies combat knife then take on the queen solo.
---
Build a house that is actually a trap with no way out (I wonder if pressure plates could be used to permanently shut a door behind someone).
---
Try and kill people by blowing up cars they are next too...that way you don’t get wanted.
---
Wear a pastors outfit and go around preaching about your new religion to everyone.
---
Start a new character with a completely different build and play style.  If you’ve been melee go stealth sniper or vice versa.
---
Or big guns
---
Or heavy weapons.
---
Or unarmed.
---
Or grenades only.  (Pacifist mode is probably a must here lol).
---
Or pistol only.
---
Or chainsaw only (good luck, needs to be 200% repaired and modded to be useful).
---
Or dress up as a clown and constantly ask people if they want to see you juggle then drop a nuka grenade at their feet 
---
 Where the central church, is there are two little windows into an area you need to find one passage to get into. The other is in that area.
---
 I'm not sure about the one near the door. What door? ;)
---
I did, but at level 8 with no imb targetting it wasn't much use :(
---
I’ve notice the nukes dropped bug out the servers also yes 
---
I find it wierd so many people have disconnects but I never do and it took me 4 days to download fallout 76
---
Morgantown HS and the cat lady house - farm those every so often and you're good to go
---
Do me ;)
---
I didn’t find them, I’ll have to go back.  Thanks!
---
Hehe :) , I really want his Detective Jacket,,, and himself to show up in 76 !! 
---
Im carrying 15k shotgub shells atm thanks 2 that 
---
They apparently have level caps in each region but I’m not so sure how accurate it is. I’ve recently spent a lot of time at level 65 back in the middle areas looking for missed locations and the creatures are no higher than 16. 
---
They also need to seriously rebalance the numbers of enemies. I can’t go 5 minutes without running into a group of something. Every new building I come across is full of enemies. It’s so tedious and ruins the post apocalyptic feeling when you’re always in combat. 
---
My instigating one does not plop it out two feet from me nor my daisycutter but my mirv fat man did all the time
---
Cant you just mitigate it with a set of 2 star assasins / sentinals? I had a guy clobber me and a friend in that setup last week. My friend was TSE equipped. I was bloody unyielding.  We lost big time to one player who was mitigating a ton of damage standing still with a an explosive rail gun.  
---
I hope things become more balanced as we see higher teir weapons and armor. 4 and 5 star. 
---
Since OP doesn't seem to know, it looks like it's fanart from the Ace Combat series. The girl is royalty of some sort (a princess I think) from the fictional nation of Erusea (based on the insignia on the fighter jet).
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I also got mine in Watoga. There are 2 vendors there who normally have.... the good stuff. I found both the metal and warehouse plans in the same go down there. 
---
Annoyingly you need the Garb itself to create another version of it, same goes for the Blade of Bastet and the gun. :/
---
Iirc Items display what they will weigh in your inventory even when in tne stash
---
The one hidden path I know of is slightly up the path from the door with the code and takes you behind the main altar. I wasnt sure if there was another one or not. 
---
The Harper's Ferry vendor's leveled list for weapon plans is missing a flag that would allow it to select from all items &lt;= the player's level. Instead, it picks one item close to the player's level, which is why after a certain point you never see anything but the radium rifle. No other vendors in the game do this, so it's highly likely that this is an oversight on Bethesda's part.
---
I used it to climb the top of the world. No, not that Top of the World. The absolute top of the world. It's north of the Top of the World, some cliffs. You can only get there with Marsupial and maybe Bird Bones too. Took about 30 minutes I think.
---
This guy gets shit done!
---
I'm missing something here. What do you mean by "spending" the perk cards?
---
Right? I have comments in here where I say this a problem affects everybody and I have so many people arguing that it's only affecting duper's I don't understand what they're trying to claim with that argument.
---
I would like limb modifiers for non-vats users.
---
It should be possible but not without the dupe exploit and I don't want to test it. You most likely need 1000+ bobbleheads to get 500k+ dmg. It stacked 179 times so I see no reason why it shouldnt stack higher as well.      
---
But even those 179 made me killing a queen with only 2 friends in less than 4 minutes. They could tell me when I reload because the 'damage flow' stopped. If it didn't caused a damage bug it should be even less then 1 minute.      
---
     
---
A stealth dragon hit made her health jump 15% down and shortly after may 7-10% up again. Sometimes. Some shots appeard to do full damage.     
---
Optimized Servos for legs
---
Optimized bracers for arms
---
Core assembly for torso
---
Targeting HUD for helm
---
The bracers don't work, as far as I can tell
---
Also an interesting side note: When I killed myself due mobs running infront of my explosive weapon I always instantly destoyed one random (overhealed) power armor parts. **So the decrease in armor condition scales to damage you recieve.**
---
I am melee and killing things is easy, unless they are in the sky the entire time.
---
Just checked; no is the answer. All items only require 2 plastic. 
---
All one stars, no two shot explosives. Sorry
---
Don't tell us how to play the game, play it the way you want. I never had to bother with inventory management in FO4, so get out of here with that nonsense. I don't dupe, but if I want to collect stuff because you know what, Fallout is all about looting ..
---
I bought Fallout not Inventory Similar 2018
---
There is a perk that makes repairing and building cheaper apparently (I don’t have it).
---
I just hit repair all because I’m too lazy to do this but I believe you can store then re-place the objects and they will be automatically repaired for free (might be useful for work benches and generators in particular).
---
Crops are cheaper to scrap then replace (gives you back all the materials needed to place it down again) BUT it’s a hassle so I just equip the green thumb perk, pick what’s left and repair all.
---
Also, if this starts happening often I’d move.
---
I’ve had it happen once in my current location and I’ve been there a couple of weeks (scorch beast, which was killed by someone and lying dead Inside the ruins of my house).
---
Apart from that I’ve had a few radrats, mole rats and the occasional super mutant but my turrets can, and sometimes actually do, take care of them.
---
Tse handmade here. Was a gift. Still feel dirty to me.
---
I feel like of you enjoyed fallout 4 then you'll probably enjoy this game 
---
Like person above me said that’s about it that and obviously the queen but no other place spawns more mobs 
---
 Yes that's right. There is another in that area that takes you to the beast himself.
---
Yeah 25 u'll be fine against anything power armor helps alot in melee builds unless ur a sneak
---
Not sure if it’s related, but my wife (og xb1) also has similar issues more frequently than I do (xb1x)
---
i mean you are not wrong.
---
Thanks! I see 15 points in Agility. I assume the 9 points in pistol skills; what others would you recommend? I'm going to bookmark this for reference as I go.
---
In trying out Morgantown so let’s see
---
Did you find the hat? I found an extra one on ps4 if you're interested 
---
Right there with you. Ironically mine is bloodied which is quite sought after but my melee/heavy build doesn't utilize it
---
Well guess I'm going back in! Thanks. 
---
Can you feed another tattered dress into the machine at the mansion to get yourself the base level one?
---
thank you. always wondered where to find that setting.
---
You hit the nail on the head, friend.
---
You can't save up low level perk points to spend on high level perk cards. If you start spending the low level points, you will start to gain access to higher level cards.
---
I've been hopping the BoS vendor in watoga for a week or so now - finally just got the T51 Calibrated Shocks plan which is what i really wanted for t51 (altho i wanted a t60 jetpack too so i'll keep hopping it).  but it's confirmed you can get that there.  I got reactive plates mod for t51 earlier in the week as well, along with just about everything else.
---
Thanks! now I won't feel so guilty for just throwing it away.
---
If you save points that you got at level 10 you can only spend them on level 10 and below perks you can get level 20 perks with them even if you are level 20
---
Don't those things instance for everyone who tries to take from it, though? So they wouldn't really be "stealing" from you. 
---
It should be luck. Don’t forget to press the “search” button when prompted it isn’t automatic. 
---
A bit late since you posted but at this time did you find any? I still haven't gotten quests from notes and rarely new quests from terminals. I have so many holotapes though, maybe i should try listening to all.
---
Where is the restaurant area , inside the main building ? 
---
Anime is as cartoon as cartoons are animated pictures.
---
I will probably be on later, I'll look to see what I have
---
Nope.
---
Mutant Slayer's Sledgehammer
---
They break after 3-4 minutes of use, but other than that...
---
Mine work fine
---
They are under powered for sure.  They are also in a weird place in that they are all basically the same, just slightly different damage values.  I would love to see them more defined.  Base .44, same numbers, but you can get a silencer.  Western, better damage, but no silence.  Single action, best damage but longest reload.
---
I don't think you take limb damage in PA.
---
Check r/fo70bazaar bound to have what you're looking for
---
I was at Whitesprings today after it was nuked and there seemed to be still lots spawning, also on xbox. 
---
What, I used a plastma gatling last night it lasted like 4 minutes.
---
Yes, they are, but that's their prerogative.  Some people want to engorge on cake, others want to savor every bite.
---
All I would say is don't come crying to me when you run out of cake. 😋
---
Never duped in my life, have traded with a few people but nothing like 100's of items that were duped, and this is happening to me, my stash box is full, I'm overencumbered and I'm trying to get rid of stuff and pulling out / putting things in and it crashes. I can vouche for this guy.
---
Yes, but you definitely have to shoot it up at an angle. It will fly for about 1.5 seconds before detonating. 
---
I understand you point and thought about wether I should post it or not.      
---
       
---
But the most important step to get it fixed soon was in my opinion to raise the awareness about.     
---
And I saw others abusing it before. That way they can't exploit the damage secretly anymore. And Bethesda knows how it works to get it fixed.      
---
In short: This thread was in my opinion the best thing I could do about it.
---
I've definitely ran into him outside the Sunshine Meadows workshops - pretty sure he completed a defense event for me once.
---
How consistently he shows is anybody's guess.  I've spent a fair bit of time there and only seen him once or twice.
---
I'm not trying to be toxic I'm just blown away by some people's laziness. I'm not exaggerating when I say this post is made at least a dozen times a day, most of time by trolls looking to start up old arguments that are finally starting to die down.
---
I'm happy to see this sub getting more into content and less fighting and bitching.  And we can see 76 has basically faded away from the main fallout sub and that's good too.
---
You posted to the person above that you wanted information  pertinent to you and your specific system and set up. Not really sure what information you were expecting when you literally just type 'should I buy this game?'   And give us no information and yourself, your likes, experiences with other Fallout games, system of preference.
---
Like gtfo with this shit kid
---
In my opinion 3 had a much better team of writers. The side stories were absolutely amazing and the game was loaded with them. It's probably fairly cheap now so definitely pick it up and give it a try.
---
4 was visually nicer. The story wasnt bad at all and the Far Harbor dlc was incredible. It has some decent side stories and settlement building if you like that. 
---
Can you collect the water?
---
they're not very good. I have a level 35 double barrel if you want. don't think it's 3 stars.
---
I encountered a weird bug the last time I played when I went to do my first power plant and every time I came within a certain distance of ANY enemies they would fall over dead and drop ZERO loot. Nothing. When I was done with the power plant I went and crossed that giant bridge and it continued to happen. Almost as soon as the ghouls would come into my field of view they make their grunting and snapping sound and die. 
---
Real weird.
---
It's actually pretty good but it has its flaws for sure
---
Nope, they are shared inventory by everyone. You can lock them in the build menu though
---
You've been lucky to have been given those, i was crafting resistant marine wetsuits and handing those out to passers by...
---
Im not saying its impossible, like yourself have obtained TSE through a different way.. i see that like a Smiling Larry random encounter but with a player.
---
Thanks. I ventured out there at lvl 15 looking for food rifle plans. I understand between lvl 15-40 you can find some good ones. Oh well, guess that was a 100 something cap lesson. 
---
My son found a quad-shot explosive dragon on our first trip into nuked White Springs. The thing does awesome damage, but it breaks after about 10 shots, even with maxed weaponsmith perks. I on the other hand have done about 10 times as many nuke zones as he has and have yet to find anything explosive, though I did find a 2-shot missile launcher and a Vampire Minigun. They're both collecting dust in my stash, waiting for the day that I have the right perks to spec into them
---
Very much worth the read. Thank you sharing!
---
&gt;So does that mean that everyone else playing the game is just progressing towards a state of boredom but at a slower pace?
---
To be fair, that's like every Bethesda game.  The end point is wherever you set it for yourself, and often boredom or being satisfied that you've seen all there is to see plays a role in where that is.
---
Have any Heavy guns? .50, Gatling, Plasma?
---
I really wish they’d fix this. There should be ways to get unique items back somehow. 
---
 Good luck. I must admit to not finding all this myself. I had help too. ;)
---
Just seen this, thanks for letting me know
---
I have 6 frames and can't place 1 of them. I don't remember what's on it. I first noticed a couple days ago.
---
I've never had this issue with it, but I also modded it from the MIRV one I got to a standard one. Seems fine, although they definitely do less damage than previous games, when they pretty much one-shot everything. 
---
It really depends on who. I bought mine for 1500caps and got my other one for free. You can also make 1400caps every 24 hours. so even 5k isn't that much when you think about it
---
Less than 5k I'd think.  Finding one might be a trick though.
---
Yep it’s a bug. A bug EVERYONE knows about. Server hopping isn’t a solution to being overweight. Trudge over to a workbench and scrap, or drop something. Being lazy isn’t an excuse. 
---
Mine is a Zealots lol. It's great for the mobs below a scorchbeast so I cant complain. 
---
The majority of my legendaries have been hunters or junkies so anything is better than that. 
---
Huh, didn't know that. My camp is far from where really anybody travels, so I haven't had this be an issue. 
---
I’m on the server just waiting
---
I feared that being the case, guess I’ll be more careful next time and hope they allow us to remake the gear in a future update.
---
Luck
---
I seen them at watoga faily often (level 105 now).
---
I’m still not sure if I’ve bought them before and mean to check but I always forget and don’t want to waste caps lol)
---
About to drop now
---
Thank you ❤
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_crafting](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_crafting)
---
then you should go and update the wiki about fo76 bulking. they have totally different results.
---
good luck.
---
So the Swift magazine exists for the radium rifle? What about the powerful automatic receiver
---
&gt;I do the workshop for the blueprints. After that , I could care less if someone takes it over.
---
As someone explained somewhere else in here once, you aren't really leveling up unless you pick a perk card for that level. So perk cards that depend on lower level cards to exist won't pop, and you won't see perk cards that unlock at higher levels until you level up fully (by choosing a perk card) until you have chosen a perk card up to the level needed for the new cards to unlock.
---
Crash for me too, 100% First Time. After restart maybe 40%
---
Fallout Forever!!!
---
Except for you, you get nothing, sorry Op.
---
it's just additive but explosive bobbleheads give +30% explosive damage. 10 are +300% &amp; 100 are +1000%.
---
Where do you get a dog?
---
You should already have the gated fences listed under "defense" unless its a different gate you want.  
---
Cooking spit I could help with.  
---
Can't guarantee if you can keep it but I could build it.
---
Where in the cave?
---
Well, that’s what I did. Unfortunately, my camp was half destroyed anyway, so I had to spend the next 20 minutes scavenging steel to repair it. 
---
Super annoying because my play time is limited.
---
Game crashed, but I have at least two gatling guns
---
Off the deathclaws. Hopefully it’s a good drop for them because my friends got it too
---
I saw headless in the Glassed Caverns today.
---
If you complete the main quest you'll get access to a vendor that sells serums. They change daily though but marsupial with the hard bargain perk is about 3800 caps. Or check the bazaar for someone who is selling the serum. I got mine cheaper from someone who had the recipe and made serums to sell.
---
You need starched genes to keep it tho. Just dont have the perk on when you take a serum. Put it on after.
---
I had a guy drop a whole set of level 50 Ultracite power armour in front on me around 2 weeks ago at White Springs train station.  Only issue is I’m around level 30 so it’s just sitting in my stash waiting for a chance!
---
Thank you mysterious stranger if you ever see this!
---
Is the date and time not displayed under the pipboy screen? On the actual pipboy, not in the display. I always assumed this was the time of day, but honestly never paid much attention or tested it against perk cards in anyway. 
---
Gotta tell you, after having my camp on a resource generator (copper) I have so much of that resource I don't know what to do with it.  Got a friend who uses it to craft so that helps but I frequently have 40-50 bulk and that's without checking it for max efficiency.  Anybody who wants to help themselves can have as much as they want!
---
If your on PSN you can come kill my bear and see for yourself.
---
If your in ps4 my psn Tackleberry_G I’ll help you anytime buddy :)
---
It would remain as long as I never destroy it or remove it. As far as the gates go I used to have them but after they changed it so that atom shop items show in the building lists it shows it as a separate item that I need plans for 
---
That’s above my pay grade. :)
---
yeah its pretty over kill for new characters I'm hoping to get a full set of it for plans later to hand off to any new builds I make
---
It doesn't, you're just spending plastic for 5 of them.  Might as well drop the plastic because it's the same thing (if your goal is saving weight, not vendoring).
---
If you want to add me my ign is ZoreanderGaming 
---
I tried that too! They gave me a thumbs up and went away (and yes, I dropped the frame with R button, not placed it liked usual). Can't imagine what they thought about me, perhaps that I was just showing off my cool suit of armor to some random strangers?
---
Yes lol,, i wish there was a Pointing Laughter emote :)
---
 A buddy explained to me that the build area is a sphere centered around your camp box doohickey. 
---
I bought it just because everyone said it Wasn’t Worth it.  It’s works as advertised. 
---
yes.  area with the headache-green carpet.
---
It's next to impossible. You can try the event patrol duty for a chance for them to drop but save yourself the headache and buy them.
---
But you can shoot it, which all I seem to do with my 50 cal.
---
I mean compared to what?  They are definitely on the lower end of dps when compared to other weapons especially when you factor in reloads.  
---
That happens a lot.  If you can find some scorched around, stand next to it and get them to shoot at you.  They can break it allowing you to repair it again.  
---
I don't have them and haven't seen them. You could make a new character and server hop or them, or you could server hop at the prison and do the event if it pops up and get a chance to get them. Do you see a pattern? Server hop or server hop.
---
That's how I've always played Fallout games.  I took the same approach with this one.
---
It's friendly, informative, but doesn't do the drama and negativity thing. I subscribe to all of the FO subs, but really enjoy Filthy Casuals for the community/drama-free aspect. 
---
Impossible. That is the consensus from the research done. You need to be lvl 15 through 20 and hop between Haper vendor and BoS vendor.
---
maybe I'm blind. sorry everyone. 
---
It was at someone’s camp
---
Aaah ok , gotta try that. Thank u very much
---
Watoga is usually good to grind, for steel and lead too.
---
Level 50 robots everywhere, that are non-hostile if you’ve done mayor for a day so you can pick them off one by one.
---
They churn out new ones from the machines fairly regularly plus there is usually a few legendaries.  
---
Plus you can do the high school while your there for some level 50 colonel gutsys...and if monster mash triggers (it usually does) a bunch of level 50 charred ghouls and at least one three star legendary.
---
Then there is whitesprings, nuke or non-nuke, high level enemies plus chance for legendaries.
---
Then events, uranium fever, patrol duty, jail break and the horde events are usually good for XP from enemies, plus plans as rewards and a legendary chance.
---
I have levelled up 2 non-beta characters to level 100 and the trophy still hasn't popped for me.
---
I've avoided using glitches just in case.
---
I now at level 99 with my third character and i'm afraid it will bug out again. 
---
I think I will wait for the patch coming out this month, but i'm not holding my breath - this is a bug brought up by both ps4 and xbox users for months now and its still not fixed
---
The biggest problem is how Bethesda can fix it, it means they have to redesign their entire lag compensation system, which takes a lot of work, and it's quite likely that the playerbase won't like the way they fix it.
---
Indeed and I hope that this post is the best reason to fix both - duplication &amp; this damage exploit - really soon. Whatever it cost.     
---
Afaik dupers abuse the inventory rollback on crash. I don't know how other MMO prevent lost items when crashing but I think the rollback should be removed. Even if it may cost a few junk parts or may even a legendary when you crash shortly after looting. But I won't miss anything lost if it means that duplication gets fixed.
---
I hope it reloads like the pump shotgun
---
Ahh... I’m running two-handed melee/unarmed.
---
This reminded me of this guy that kept following me around, trying to kill me with melee while we were in the middle of a nuked Whitespring. I was in full PA while he was wearing a Hazmat Suit. He was a bit annoying and since I'm always in Pacifist Mode, I decided to smack vehicles in the hopes the explosion would kill him. After making a couple of cars explode, he finally ran away.
---
Locked our junk extractor today and it almost certainly precipitated costly PVP. Won't do that again.
---
Sobbing?  Ha you’re funny.  Reloading this game isn’t going to get rid of the crashes.  Sadly the game has its issues and there are tons of other folks who have been having this regularly.   Just had a team last night with 4 guys in which 2 suffered crashes while in Whitesprings nuke during a Glowing invasion.  Lasers isn’t it - a lot of action is.
---
Whether it’s the game crashing from too much going on or server disconnects, I can assure you the issue isn’t going to rectified itself.  Next thing you’ll tell me is to try turning it off and on...   my story is just that, a rant to what is still clearly an issue for many users.  
---
Maybe a PS Pro is the answer as some have said that frame rate issues haven’t happened for them that others have.  That would make sense but as we all know, buying a slightly better console isn’t the issue.
---
Dead raider leader body during rose’s questline?
---
Spoiler:
---
-
---
It tells you the body is rigged to explode. 
---
My point was that Bethesda *employees* do not control when the game is released.
---
In some ways, it flops as a Fallout game *because* it's a good Bethesda game.  76 is Bethesda doubling down on the self-guided exploration of a giant, beautifully strange world they are known for.  If that's what draws you into their games, you'll likely find a lot to like in 76.
---
But Fallout diehards generally expected more - they want to argue philosophy with NPCs and make sweeping moral choices - and 76 has none of that.
---
I can see both sides, but for me, the urge to explore was strong enough to overcome the lack of conversations.
---
I know just trying to see how much it would cost
---
Put it in your stash. To my knowledge all workbenches share junk, so stuff from your camp should transfer (from what I remember) 
---
Farming Screws is difficult, better off buying them. As for springs, McClintock (boot camp place) has clipboards which contain springs. Black titanium can be achieved by farming Deathclaw Island, bc that’s how I did it.
---
I had thought this might be the case, too.  Today while server hopping in Grafton, I came across Plans: Excavator Optimized Servos for sale by Vendor Bot Greg (the "other" vendor in Grafton, not the train station one).
---
There are a couple death laws around the golf course.  When I see one I try to shoot it and run it back to the 1st buildings.  There is usually someone in the area to help me take it out.
---
I'd be okay with this SOLELY under the premise you can not nuke hot spots for yourself. The game would rng you into a random instanced location NOT on the map, something like a rad filled dungeon. Otherwise that is just, no. Too powerful and everyone would instance whitesprings minus the few "friends" who do SBQ randomly.
---
And gatling plasma....well most heavy weapons 
---
Not that i condone this however it could be quite funny,,, especially with "i need a Job" protest sign equiped .  
---
Good god. The power of two is strong in those amounts... 
---
Care to explain why?
---
Care to ... elaborate?
---
The Reconstituted US Army is always trying to collect Military salvage.  It would be nice to have Army signage and a US flagpole for our installations, but we ain’t picky.

Gen. Dawson
---
i mustve been thinking about smelting and acid then
---
That's what I'm trying to do. Problem is it seems like they'll never pop up. At least from the other replies and stuff I've seen online.  Or are you talking about from another player? 
---
What do you sell to the vendors?
---
I always sell my meds don’t use them and all the loot off the glowing ones in nuke zones anything else that gets you a lot of caps?
---
Good reply.
---
It's worth noting that the current anticheat is so silly that these skilled hackers you mentioned thought it was a joke or a honey pot.
---
Its based off of Intelligence. The smarter you are, the better things you can craft, and at a faster rate. If you are not that smart, either you cannot make top tier items, or it takes you longer because you have to swap the cards. Its plausible, it fits the theme of roleplaying. Everyone is just bitching because they want shit handed to them, and quickly. What point would a lvl 15 INT build have if crafting perks were passive? 
---
I personally like having my int high do you makeshift warrior or gunsmith activated. Your weapon condition lasts way longer. 
---
The jail break event should just show up on your map but is best if you have 3 others in the group to help you out or else its gonna take way too long. But the fastest way to get the plans is to just make a new character level them up buy the plans then trade it to a friend that will trade it back.
---
Will add in a sec
---
my “other games” are mostly just games where the developers don’t know what they’re doing and just try to steal money from it’s playerbase... oh wait
---
Those dang powered doors, have been looking for them for weeks and he never has them in stock.
---
It’s either one of two problems 1. You send a team infinite but the person you’re sending it to doesn’t receive one 2 you receive a team invite and the game won’t allow you to join it 
---
Also sorry for not elaborating
---
Hi Death, I'm Dad.
---
Yep.  It's a safe bet no matter how they do it, there will be a performance cost somewhere.
---
Even when you back out it doesn't show the point as being added until you've selected a perk. It's completely reasonable to think that the points aren't added at that screen. I really thought that was just a screen telling you what each point will do and giving a generic overview of the type of cards that will be in that category.
---
Such a dumb design.
---
I don't think Bethesda are listening anymore. I haven't seen a "Bethesda replied" for a while.
---
Bullet sponges:
---
- take perks buffing damage for your weapon of choice.
---
- get armour penetration perks for that weapon type.
---
- consider stealth and it’s damage multipliers.
---
- make sure your gun is at your level for maximum damage and modded with a good receiver.
---
- aim for the weak points, usually head, sometimes not (looking at you robots and mirelurks).
---
- make sure your gun is the best type it can be (at your level a hunting rifle is fine for example, a pipe rifle is not (usually) but the hunting rifle will soon be obsolete and you’ll need to upgrade, same for pistols...a 10mm only carries you so far unless it’s an awesome legendary.
---
Ahhh always one,,, well done well done!!,, do you want proof !!!! Believe what u want ,, i know the truth of what happened.
---
I got it the first time I did patrol duty at level 50 on my alt (heard was bugged wanted to test it for myself) so maybe I got lucky or the hotfix they did the other day fixed it? I'm on ps4 btw
---
lucky hole mine makes it so i dont even tag lead anymore. I'm actually having a harder time keeping up on steel of all things. 
---
If you run through lucky hole mine with excavator power armor and harvest the lead nodes, you can end up with a couple hundred lead ore without server hopping.
---
You're too high of a level for them to pop up at a vendor. Gotta buy from another player. 
---
Sooo many screws :(
---
Yeah, Bethesda already clearly states they have no way to find out if an item is duped, and also don’t care to actually take any action against them.
---
i mean u couldve just said go to patches of trees near fissure prime and loot the ferns. they are everywhere. didnt need a video
---
Ahh.. well, allow me to amend. If you have enough lead to bulk, you have enough lead to fast travel to Clickum (on PC) and drop it on the ground kindly!
---
How long till u launch?
---
Im playing PS4 and the longest run I've had is 4 hours without a disconnect, it's usually once an hour, I've been downvoted into oblivion for saying this before but it's gotten worse with every patch, I'm not sure if it's in the backend, if it's bugs, if it's just late game Bethesda (vanilla skyrim back in the day got worse late game, real resource intensive), or if its a community thing using exploits the servers hate. Either way it sucks, and it's getting worse.
---
Yeah sorry I meant buy them from another player. From level 25-50 I consistently hopped and never once seen them from a vendor.
---
Some people are just jerks and will destroy your camp even though they don't get anything out of it. Every item you place has a health bar and will be destroyed if it gets too low. Then you have to pay in scrap to repair it at your camp box.
---
Enemies also tend to spawn and attack your camp buildings and decor which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Why are super mutants shooting my walls when there are ramshackle houses everywhere they're leaving alone or even living in?
---
Theoretically, good defenses can discourage other players or kill the random enemies, but most defenses aren't really good enough. 
---
I like to just kill the enemies when I fast travel in. I don't build any turrets and I just hope that nobody finds my base or that if they do, they appreciate the free workbenches, food, water, beds, and instruments, and the amount of time I spent making it look nice, and don't mess it up. Turrets also eat up your camp budget a ton. My camp with turrets couldn't be more than a one room shack, now it's a sizable house with several rooms, a garage, and lots of decor.
---
That's a great way to make a video. Some subtitles would also be nice.
---
Btw if you need Cobalt Flux, you can nuke Morgantown Airport. 
---
How much are you asking?
---
My first nuke zone thats all i did. Running around in a hazmat suit at level 20 stimpaking the lvl50+ guys. Putting a shot on the scorched just to mooch the xp. It was a symbiotic relationship
---
I always ask people what ammo they need and then I drop 3k or and say this might help you
---
Haven't done the cat lady house. I have also heard Watoga HS is a good source, but it's never something I think about while there. I should, since it only (optimally) costs me two shotgun shells per Protectron.
---
\&gt; The game would rng you into a random instanced location NOT on the map 
---
Sounds good to me.
---
\&gt; Too powerful and everyone would instance whitesprings minus the few "friends" who do SBQ randomly.
---
And what is wrong with that? whitesprings is overnuked already 
---
Haha! I’ll add you and if I see you online I’ll drop you some lead.
---
Yea plans are really the only reason I Cap the work shop anymore.  Initial plans for capping and then the plans for defending that usually pops up within 2 minutes of the capture.
---
Come play state of decay 2 with me! Hell of a game!
---
Yes most things from nuke zones are sold for a pretty penny. But honestly what I do in I travel to a vendor, Walk the surrounding area and kill everything and take everything. Then sell it to them. All the guns and stuff. Then onto the next vendor and repeat. But also bulk your junk you have to much of and sell that too
---
the good mods for the vault jumpsuit and BOS underarmor use stable versions of flux. 
---
to get a stable flux you have to get 10 of any color and craft it with a glowing and a hardened mass, maybe something else and it makes a stable version that wont go inert after a while. 
---
if ur melee build the BOS underarmor gives 2 strength when upgrade with stable violet flux
---
I had mutants earlier today. On XB1
---
What system? I can let you come to my camp on Xbox and take some of you need any 
---
Yes. I'm just an idiot who can't remember wording.
---
My experience has been that they appear to be a random drop mostly from crowned mobs and occasionally found inside locked containers.
---
Pick up a bobblehead?
---
It was the other way around with me. I'm a level 40 and there was a squad of 4 low levels that wanted to kill me because they thought they could loot my power armor. They weren't that weak either tbh they has some pretty powerful shotguns and kept throwing frag grenades but my supersledge was superior. God I love that weapon.
---
And remember to ring that bell so you don't miss any of our next videos! 
---
How about a framed Commendation medal, fellow general?
---
actually gonna be on some today
---
turned lv100 5 min back, lol
---
Will join you GT, mine is Spawn3232  :)
---
I’m joining now if it’s not too late, world is full actually 
---
Took me awhile to find the specialized nuka-cola stand in whitesprings also, where you can buy nuka-grape and nuka-orange etc
---
 "And i see people on internet with same specs have 60+FPS."
---
These people are wrong and are not using proper fps monitoring software. There is no way they would have a constant, smooth 60 fps at all times.
---
During combat and instances were a lot of particles are going off at once, they will hit the same wall you are. While your CPU is strong, it's old, it's ipc is not the best and will slow down during intense sense where particles take over. The 1060 3gb also does not have enough vram to smoothly run the game without dips. I can only assume the ddr3 is not help but I can not imagine it is hindering either.
---
In truth a lot of people with your specs saying they are getting 60fps, are. In short burst, but there are dips where they will fall down to 40 and even 30 fps and stay there until the screen clears up.
---
Hell I have a 2080ti and 8700k and I still get stutters here and there, the games not very will optimized in itself either, so do take that into account.
---
To say the truth, I fled in terror the first time someone shot a random paperbag like it insulted his mother 
---
ahhhhhhhh ok yes, it was that quest.... I'll mark this with spoiler tag incase... Thanks that helps!
---
Ok thanks for the advice!
---
Which build did you opt for? I’m level 22 and so far just perked whatever made sense. Too late?
---
Technically, yes.  From a practical standpoint?  Ehh.  It seems like logging out and back in every 59 minutes would create lots of other difficulties.
---
That's not to say it shouldn't be fixed.  It's just way, way, way down on the list compared to addressing duping and the duped items already in circulation.
---
I'd assume they'd split players based on input
---
Any particular events net higher than usual XP?
---
\&gt;fallout 76
---
\&gt;5 characters
---
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Just have 1 ranged weapon and one melee weapon OP.  It’s too much weight to have a rifle, a pistol and a melee unless you’re always in excavator power armour or they have legendary effects reducing their weight by 90%.
---
I play on PC so I doubt we can do that :( Thank you for the offer though!
---
Added
---
Bobbleheads*
---
Yeah lever rifle plans cost something like 892 caps.
---
I think I bought mine from watago, they also dropped from the patrol duty event afterwards 
---
sometimes its mutants sometimes its scorched or ghouls.
---
Sorry, what's the question?
---
Do you use gunsmith lvl 5
---
Back when I was bothering taking workshops, I was often claiming the Lakeside Cabins mainly for the lead deposit there and each time I had the place claimed, I was seeing Grahm pass through the area. Never bothered to check what he was selling back then, would have probably found some nice stuff.
---
Yes, but you have competition. It's stupid to think you should be able to nuke whitesprings in an instance for you yourself or a group of you and 3 of your buddies. It's a powerful zone due to the broken spawn rate due to the quest line there.
---
You need to make concessions if you want something that broken and powerful added to the game. Not to mention the increased load it would put onto the servers themselves.
---
71 and I'm feeling it. 
---
it can be one of 3 (random chance) ghouls, super mutants, scorched (sometimes can be a mix of them in which case they will attack each other)
---
No PS4 
---
Yes I use gunsmith 5 and lucky draw 3. Flamer also breaks in seconds. Gatling Laser lasts a decent while but does extremely low dps. RIP energy weps.
---
This just happened to me. Accidentally damaged someone's chair...15 min later some rando person kills me and steals all my stuff. Had a decent amount of ballistic fiber and black titanium. So I send a message to him and he says he'll sell it back to me for 2k caps....
---
Sadly I don't think furious works that good. 
---
Check out the Generals Steakhouse.  It’s where I found mine.  It has a huge garden outside 
---
they are insane, my western pistol is around 740 damage with a...vigorous receiver i think (dmg+fire rate)
---
exploding shotguns are on a whole nother level as each pellet explodes, with shotgun perks you can get sniped in PVP
---
While I would love ceiling and wall turrets, they would be way too strong for farming. Lots of mobs wouldn't be able to even reach them.
---
Thanks bud,  but I’d prefer around my level. Someone on their first play through would be nice too, so we can actually discover things. Taking my time with the story and exploring. I don’t care to level up as fast as possible or be told where everything is.
---
Correct, because by backing out, you’ve taken back the point.
---
The design is fine. You don’t want to be forced into putting the SPECIAL point into the category that corresponds to the Perk Card that you want, because it limits flexibility. However, given that there are quite a few people who either missed or forgot about about the message that explained this to you at the beginning, it’s clear that the mechanic needed to be explained better.
---
Luck. Starched Genes. 
---
Do you have that equipped on accident and/or purpose?
---
Also how mutations do you have you never said. 
---
Yessss. I regret getting this one because I end up hurting my teammate AND prevent myself from being revived by them 
---
looking for a pump or combat
---
I mean, why would people make videos at all then? Some people prefer a walkthrough instead of reading. Stop being so negative man.
---
This game is a joke, banning the players that want to play and now the players can sell paint that hasn’t been released yet. FO76 is a pile of shit rofl. Scamming the players and now themselves.
---
Actually title says   **W: TSE Gatling Gun w/ 90% reduced weight. H: Caps.** If W or H stand for some weird code for looking for shit, it isn't something us who never use reddit will understand. Please contribute something useful to the convo or stay out.
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
Hmm that’s interesting, I don’t have a secondary screen set up but perhaps I should add one &amp; fiddle around to see if I can get some results.. 
---
Tried doing patrol duty for about 3-4 hours and only got the laser pistol plan. So looks like I'll just have to buy one from a player.
---
And just happened again.  
---
Now that is indeed a issue. I know the first issue could simply be people ignoring the request, I do that. I am normally in the middle of something anyway so it's easy to ignore XD. The second issue, now that is one they need to fix. If you get a invite from a friend it should just join you to the world your teammate is on, if I got that correct.
---
No problem, we all do it :P.
---
Pretty sure they said later this month
---
No caps on mutations. The game might’ve just bugged. I recommend getting starched genes, first level reduces chance of radaway and what not taking your mutations away, second level keeps them safe completely.
---
And if you’re looking for certain mutations, you can buy serums on r/fo76bazaar
---
Mutant Slayer's Minigun, Mutant's Gatling Gun (broken, needs repairing), Stalker's Gatling Gun, Zealot's 50 Cal Machine Gun
---
Absolutely did. 
---
I don't know if this is completely random, but maybe when you get to 45 it might be useful.
---
[https://streamable.com/lb24y](https://streamable.com/lb24y)
---
Ok thank you! I'll check it out in a few. Someone is dropping a nuke for Scorchbeast Queen
---
Nice, also you have just given me a new quest - find the anchor weapon.
---
Now my heart drops into my stomach if I see another player. 
---
I feel that Ghoulish and Cannibal work good together.
---
I only use ironclad since I don't use PA. 
---
Except they have no way of knowing how quickly people obtained items.
---
Yeah thats pretty nice, I get a lot of duplicates. I now just do it to complete my daily challenges, complete an even while doing something, best and easiest way to get this done. I have a workshop near both my camps one each side of the making making it super convienant ..
---
You were like 1 minute from your camp (sounds like it’s in the same spot as mine) and you took the risk of this happening...it would have taken longer to server hop then it would have to just walk there.  (Side note you did scrap everything at the workbench inside Blackwater mine first right? It sounds like you were still over encumbered even without the junk...scrap weapons before leaving too)
---
Yeah, you should have had the option to respawn at, at the very least, vault 76 but it has been there since launch unfortunately.
---
So that was 10 minutes wasted for you OP for what would have been a 30 second walk.
---
I got calibrated shocks. Was so so stoked when I saw it.
---
I’m pretty sure there is an update coming out soon they gave some information about what it was including.
---
New vaults, player vendor, bug fixes 
---
You would have to look up the details don’t know when it’s dropping 
---
No cap. You can still get all mutations but you need to server hop between each one to reset the timer.
---
Also as matthew stated, equipped starched genes once you get the mutation you want. It stops you from gaining anymore mutations and stops you from losing the ones you have.
---
&gt; It’s too much weight
---
Wow that's surprising, I don't usually have a problem with my carry weight. I'm usually in power armor but not excavator. Maybe there's stuff I should be picking up but don't realize it
---
Hadn’t seen Patrol Duty pop in weeks. Finally got it today, and the Handmade plan dropped. Lvl 72 btw
---
I just sit at a fissure in stealth and bead shot them in VATS as they emerge.
---
That is easier.
---
The first problem isn’t really an issue of people ignoring it because mostly the only time I team is when my friend and I are in a party. We mostly team up for pvp but not being able to puts us at a considerable disadvantage. Not to mention it’s just really handy to be able to go to each other’s camps without someone having to be there to fast travel to.
---
No Starched Genes yet, I was planning on getting that after receiving Marsupial again. Especially now that I have so many other spicy mutations:
---
Adrenal Reaction 
---
Chameleon 
---
Electrically Charged 
---
Healing Factor 
---
Speed Demon
---
Unstable Isotope 
---
If you read the guidelines of the group. W: is want and H: is have
---
Let me know if she or you need some help. My gt matimaster130
---
Did you loot everything? Bodies and piles despawn sooner if empty
---
I was and did for as long as my session allowed. I had it for a good hour. What I should have done was dismantled everything before I left.
---
It's a pole hook with puncturing mod. It's almost as good as grognax's axe, and you can over repair it. Works really well.
---
I already had everything else I needed in my stash (safe cause I know how that works lol).  I was literally going to craft every single piece of the armor all at once but lost some screws and springs, then game crashed.  
---
The build area is an orb around the initial camp placement. So it is the same if you build downwards, e.g. into a cave.      
---
Also when teammates or friends travel to you **they spawn where you initially placed the camp station**. If you want to build foundations there, build them as near to the ground as possible. If the foundation is too high people will get stuck in it! They spawn on the ground because camp items are loaded in a few seconds later.
---
Big update expected shortly.  Likely this week or next.
---
I have a frame with excavator armor on it. When I go to craft it says none for available patterns now
---
But the game clearly tells you what you’re going to be doing... why would you want to undo that? 
---
It’s like if you made a cocktail with two ingredients, but then realize you wanted a different type of alcohol. Where’s the undo button for that?
---
Posted :)
---
That there is a reverse-robbery.
---
I’m usually standing farther away and I shoot near it.  I usually do a come here emote first though. 
---
Rejuvenated is nice, ghoulish is okay when in nuke zones. Any of the QOL perks are pretty nice.
---
To be fair I’m a stealth sniper build with only 1 point in strength BUT all my armour is heavily pocketed except my chest piece (dense because explosions).  So I have 215 carry weight.
---
235 with grilled radstag...which I almost always have.
---
ghoulish, rejuvenated (almost every build)
---
Radicool, solar powered (melee builds especially adrenal/bloodied)
---
revenant (if you play in a team purposely downing yourself and getting revived can allow you to nuke SBQ)
---
Cola nut (if you have a reliable nuka quantum farm near your base can make you damn near unkillable for a while and power attack/vats like crazy)
---
lol nope. I don’t dupe. Never have. Don’t even have an explosive weapon. 
---
Easy there guy, the format for trading is pretty common knowledge at this point. W-want H-have isn’t that terribly difficult to decipher.
---
Your father was a hamster and your mother smells of elderberries! 
---
make 10000 38 rounds that weigh nothing with bandoleer 
---
What about the bug when the scorchbeast is screaming non stop?
---
The one in Camden Park does, too. I got the motion assist mod for it a couple days ago there. Nice surprise.
---
Or just type looking like a normal person?
---
In fallout 76 I’d probably pick the raiders
---
Pull the armor off the frame completely and try again?
---
Yes, it's an empty pile
---
Well I guess I know what I’ll be server hopping for now!
---
&gt;it's been a while since the last major update
---
It's been weeks. Calm down.
---
I had it drop 2 out of...6 rolls maybe...doing patrol duty.
---
RNG can certainly screw with you but it's not like trying to tract down calibrated shock plans.
---
This is how I always play Fallout games... with a bit of kleptomania. I enjoy sitting in the back with a rifle and breathing everything in than rushing ahead. I waited on this game because it was West Virginia and thats where my emotionally abusive ex came from and it just would flood my mind with memories I want to forget, but I don’t regret buying it I’m enjoying the game.
---
I may have to build that armor now...
---
As for steel, fast travel to Camp McClintock. Turn around and run down the hill a bit. There will be a Military Ammo Bag in the driver's side backseat and another near the corpse on your right. Turning around from the corpse, there's a steel tower at the bottom of the hill. Under that tower is a steel node.
---
Build your CAMP there to mine steel and ballistic scrap for a few days. 
---
Goddamn bugs. I've had good luck with bugs up until now.
---
Thanks for letting me know about that sub! At this point I might just have to try that. 
---
I have the powered gates plan and I used it, but I can’t build the powered doors. Am I missing something?
---
Agreed. I'm just still puzzled as to why? What is the real benefit. Oh well. I'm sure plenty of players are like you and me and just play. Best of luck out there
---
you can't destroy foundations, stairs and floor objects
---
To each their own.  The normal weapons are worse than BB guns. 
---
Have fun spending 1000+ rounds of ammo and 50 stimpacks over 10 minutes to kill a scorch beast for barely any loot. That’s not fun to me either. 
---
Also I wouldn’t attempt the SBQ without some decent guns. 
---
On which platform do you play?
---
No problem we are doing another can you nuke prime twice on the same server? 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong but I shouldn't have to play around Beth's bugs.
---
and yes, I scrapped the weapons.
---
Yeah looking at the screens now, I can see what you're on about  - I was thinking "Slots available" not "Ranks"  
---
I'll just get my coat... ;)  
---
Whats the negative to marsupial?
---
This is like the premise of a post apocalyptic movie.  Glad you two can bond over this game.
---
Alright we are going to drop another
---
I laughed at PS Pro. I found your issue 😂
---
More seriously, I don't have any issues of this kind on the pc version and I played it all the week with PC specs that where well under the minimum requirements, only crashes where from scorchbeast queens fights that were too high for the machine.
---
I sincerely hope they fix your bug soon. I'd have already thrown the console out of my window in your place
---
I predict that no one is going to convince you. Because they should be removed from the game, and they are terribly unbalanced, and everyone knows it, even the people who debate otherwise.
---
Do u know where to get the other I'd card to open gate down under mama dolces? Jw bc I'm on the Google Reddit hunt for the answer -_- 👍
---
The gods smiled upon me that day. I haven't seen anything even close to that good since.
---
Not sure if you are taking Lone Wanderer for the AP regen or the damage res, but there are huge diminishing returns on Action Boy and LW for AP regen, really only need one or the other.
---
Give us about 15 minutes till we drop another
---
I know, i would happy play with 30FPS locked if it would get rid of that terible stutter, but i tried it and it was same.
---
There is no problem with GPU or RAM, but CPU usage is spiking to 100%.
---
You need to do the steps in a certain order.  If you don't you can sometimes un-glitch it by getting the scorched to wreck it. 
---
Well, each of the armors have pocketed (5 carry weight) and deep-pocketed (10 carry weight)
---
&gt; quad shot explosive dragon
---
Holy anti-tank cannon, Batman!
---
pc, why u ask?
---
Or just doesn’t land. I’m stuck standing around with my super sledge.
---
Yep. Just like it's no issue to dismantle a desk fan or radioactive canister while wearing a power armor but stirring some soup or repairing a sledgehammer, noooooo
---
They need to fix pacifist, mines hurt you alot especially if they plant them then shot them before you set them off. Not sure what's happening but that trick has been used against me to steal my junk...also if they engage u long enough turn it off you instantly can die don't know if that's a bug or the games considering you hostile because I've never returned fire and it's automatically made me in PvP... I never turn it off now...
---
What does ghoulush exacly?  It heals your rad dmg ?
---
I miss my marsupial. Pushed my luck a few times too many with diluted rad-aways. Leveled up 3 minutes later and was able to get starched genes.
---
I’ll get it later I thought. 
---
Swam in toxic water off and on to get my rads. Did that for 2 or 3 days in a row. Leveled up again and realized I had Starched Genes the whole time. 
---
Yeah, I was server hopping and doing everything the usual farm guides said. I'm about to level, too, so I hoped to get SG after finally reuniting with Marsupial.
---
Just weird I got the pop-up but it didn't equip after all. Thanks though, glad there's no cap! 
---
yeah it is
---
I've had that one for a long time, so it does exist. I believe I just got it as a drop. I've seen the trapper ones at this vendor (and others) and I believe it had it on one of my hops yesterday as well, although it could just as well have been the other trapper ones.
---
Does one of the most powerful classes really need PA though? 
---
I think not, lol.
---
Also size matters. I don't think there is a tambourine big enough for that metal shroud you call a hand in PA.
---
* rejuvenated makes you much more disease resistant while boosting HP and AP regen
---
* ghoulish heals while in combat
---
* radicool most bloodied/adrenal builds use rads to keep you at the 20-30% hp range so it's essentially a 1 point 20-25% damage boost
---
* cola nut don't forget about the nuka cola vendor in whitesprings to get the most of this perk
---
why is there no damn power fist mod for the power armor arms?
---
I've finished this event a few times and I've never gotten a reward. 
---
Mutations are absolutely game breaking and offer little downside usually.  Stacking them is even worse. 
---
But yeah, marsupial is fun AF
---
They exist.  Getting mods are a pain but they exist as well.  Someday I'll be able to upgrade them from "welded".
---
I saw someone mentioning they got the combat armor paint schemes from a vendor. It’s an old topic so there’s no use in replying to it, but I’m guessing he’s talking about Phoenix.
---
Technical Data still spawns, check the military wing in Whitesprings bunker.
---
Starp scarping mar mards
---
As long as it’s only equitable with a one handed melee weapon.
---
When you take rads it also gives you health. Unless your health is full. You just take rad damage then. 
---
So when you eat radiated food and drinks it also heals more health. 
---
Ok do each vendor in white spring hold 200? Or is it 200 over all of them?
---
Don't need to convince you, if you want them removed you need to convince Bethesda...or get over it
---
&gt; Yes, but you have competition. 
---
Never thought about that, so people who KoS 3 stars legendaries without waiting everyone aren't being jerks, they're just competing against me so they can loot for themselve the enemies who spawned because I launched a nuke right?
---
I honestly wonder sometimes if it was a case of the guy who rebalanced the legandry effects for 76 was an explosive effect fanboy from FO4. Cause its true, they nerfed damage output of almost everything...except explosive, and low-HP buff stacking. In fact I think explosive got even better. It used to only add 15 damage/shot.
---
Now this isn’t epic 
---
Awwww a pole hook! My melee character scrapped dozens if them because my axes &amp; hammers hit harder.  I wanted an anchor damnit.
---
I received my plans for the armor, but not for accessories.
---
Better hope Cartman isn't playing lol dam hippie's
---
So no pistol hipfire allowed with a shield up?
---
i get having a video for something that requires a walkthrough but this is literally "Go here, do one thing, profit" 
---
if the whole video can literally be one sentence then no.. you didnt need a video
---
They have bad accuracy, aiming helps with all ts but still.
---
I highly doubt these are the players buying things from the atom store.... 
---
Short term sure but long term no, and with the amount of bad press this game has gotten any executive worth a shit would know that any issue this large and damaging to the product has to be dealt other wise your player base will fall and you won’t have enough new players willing to spend money on the game. 
---
One of the lookout towers between the divide and the big. Can’t remember the name off hand. Lots of plants, including melons I think.
---
I made it because I wanted to. If you dont like it dont watch it
---
I mean if I just click it without charging it hits. If the meter says 95 percent it shouldn't be missing regardless and in fo4 clicking and charging we're the same 
---
The worst is when you walk up to the corpses and there are 3 Star legendaries among them 
---
I've been rotating between event-farming and explorations.  Daily and weekly challenges.  Nukes when I feel like it.  Am starting to run out of things to do on my base though - need a bigger budget or some significant drops or, preferably, both!
---
W and H is used in many places for trading, not just reddit. 
---
Bug?? I dont know if its a bug. I just fire through the blasts and heal myself as needed. Again, it can be annoying, sure, but its a challenge, that in the long run, i finish. Loot/XP may also not be worth it, but i think the same people crying about how scorchbeast function are the same crying about nothing to do.
---
Patrol duty is that something I'd see on the map or do I have to be at the prison first?
---
Could have gave you some
---
Maybe with a strength stat above 10?
---
What system are you playing on?
---
I have 5k and I don’t use it
---
I can highly recommend it. A while back I got the same urge and I just started putting words to paper. Well, digital paper, but still. I've written a couple of short stories and although I'll never publish or post them somewhere, it was really nice to get into it. 
---
Um excuse me that's where you're wrong kiddo
---
Speed Demon + Healing Factor = Unstoppable Juggernaut
---
I promise you I won't tell anything I even make a new character if you want 
---
Just be aware that when crafting/building that any mods you have will be automatically scraped before breaking down bulked steel or bulked titanium.  This subreddit had many posts about people losing their rare mods because if this 'feature'.  You'll want to make sure that you leave plenty of unbulked scrap steel and black titanium to protect against this issue.
---
How long were you server hopping before it came up?  
---
I can’t remember off the top of my head but I thought that was the quest that required you to ace an exam on a computer first. 
---
You turned off pack rat correct?
---
Can you explain just a bit more?
---
For me it's not worth it because I cant keep track of how much of something I have. 
---
&gt; I'm not saying that these weapons should be removed
---
Meh. At the very least, both Two shot and Explosive need to be completely replaced with all new perks that aren't damage multipliers.
---
ur on pc?
---
No, but he could have respectfully replied for those of us who rarely frequent reddit. Not everyone on this planet comes here enough to know all the rules and etc. He **thought** he was being cute and witty with the "..." where is the etiquette?
---
Nice to know. You speak from experience?
---
Both.  I've seen it pop on the map and I've also had it trigger when I fast travel there.
---
You still on, and feeling generous? I'm lvl 16, and in need of better weapons, shotgun/rifle.
---
I see some videos of low levels pvping and they have to shoot each other a bunch of times to kill each other. It kinda looks a lot more fun than being one shotted. But I have an explosive shotgun now and some perks that boost the damage. Already killed myself with it about 3 times after finding it yesterday. At least I can somewhat defend myself if they have them now.
---
Yea, its annoying with a gun to not have it land also, but again, its called a challenge for a reason. 
---
Also, from what ive read, melee is "OP" anyway, so if the downside to being a melee type is that its harder to fight a creature that can fly, so be it. Seems plausible that its hard to hit the flying piñata with a stick. I say were lucky the things land at all.
---
Hehe, now I want an actual kitchen sink as a slow melee weapon in the next update. 
---
I don’t; I welcome all to my base UNLESS they are out to destroy it. Otherwise, people are welcome to use the crafting benches, take from the farm, the water, etc. :) 
---
When they aren’t lagging, they scream once or twice every 20sec or so. When they’re lagging it’s just a minigun of screams that you can’t evade from
---
Boy it makes me wish I could just send you to a texture mod for the game like in Fo4 cause I assume that would vastly help take a load of your cpu.
---
Suggestions:
---
1.) look into ini tweaks, google search or reddit search. They might be able to help alleviate some games stutters by letting you tweak things to your liking.
---
2.) Make sure you're in full screen if you're not already.
---
3.) Use Gforce and see what it's ideal settings are for your pc if it's what you're already using, ignore this but if not click on the button allowing it to change the game settings, it will FORCE the textures to lower as where the in game settings will not.
---
Other than that, you could try lowering the resolution for now but thats blah. So hopefully you don't need to.
---
Depends what you mean when you say 'normal' weapons. A base gun of appropriate level with the right perk setup is going to rip through enemies in any case; this game wasn't designed to be 'hard'. With a TSE it just makes it so you only have to use 5 bullets instead of 30.
---
I use a 50% armour pen 50cal (level 25 version lol) that I found and I can take out groups of glowing ghouls faster than the dudes running around with TSE shotguns because of their slow ass reload times after taking out 1-2 ghouls at a time. Once I get a really good 50cal they won't even be able to compete.
---
Just because something is FotM doesn't mean it's the best available.
---
Also, why do people keep complaining about scorchbeasts? They're a joke. Cripple the wings so they land and then just kill them. My zealot gatling (again, found it) rips them to shreds, and my T60 means the scorchbeasts would be lucky to make me use 1 stimpak before they're dead.
---
Same here. I had my camp on that node for like a week before other people seemed to find it. Now I camp back on that lake a bit east of there. There's usually a person or two also camped somewhere on that river/lake when I login. Feels like a little community.
---
The good drops are easily less than 1% of total drops. You probably need thousands to start seeing good stuff.
---
Weeks in a live service environment with major issues is a while.
---
I had one, seems like the shots spread out to much, i only used it on big things after awhile
---
Okay. I'll fast travel there and server hope till it triggers or comes up on the map.  Do I have to be inside or just run up to the prison for it to trigger?
---
Ever since I put the charging barrel on it my xbox crashes if there is more then 2 enemy's
---
what if someone had just dropped a nuke? what if I didn't have a hazmat on me?
---
keep justifying Bethesda's fuckups. it's clearly doing wonders for the game- stuff as basic as this is *still* in the game.
---
Hit up the bunkers and bases. I usually see a lot of fans in those areas. 
---
The lumber yard next to 76 has a garage with a box of loose stuff on a diagnostic table. 
---
It does on weapons with good rates of fire but also decent damage. Otherwise they are meh since you dont get much stack or the damage increase is meh.
---
You'll need it for nuke zones and for other limited situations (ie high level deathclaws, scorched beast fights) but not really necessary otherwise.
---
Yeah that's wierd. I still feel like it's gotta be bugged cuz other fallout games that wasn't the case if I spam crits I'm fine but if I don't I see 95 and it's like miss miss miss 1 shot
---
 Tried the LMG, can actually make it, and its garbage as far as I can tell. Just try out a Gatling gun and you will see what I mean.
---
 I have 1400 .308. Since I acquired the Lever Action Rifle I don't use the Hunting Rifle anymore.
---
I just assume anyone over level 70 is using a TSE weapon. At this point they're so common that I would be surprised if someone doesn't have one at such a high level. 
---
I mean you don't need to convince me, I'm not forcing you to convince me. In fact, I didn't force you to reply to my OP. You don't need to do anything, so why are you belly aching over this? You don't have to be here, sorry for wanting to have a discussion I guess.
---
I run a low life melee build for the SBQ and this is by far my favorite perk. I just deposit my junk before the fight and if her slam aoe hits me I laugh my ass off as my orbital strike beacon tags her back. 
---
Best perk point I've spent.
---
I concur. Being able to jump high enough to get on top of more building changes the dynamics of the game. Now that i have the mutation I don't think I'll ever get rid of it.
---
Might just be me, but even on SBQ they didn't amount to much and TES are just superior. 
---
It depends on your build and play style. 
---
I'm almost exclusively melee and a hoarder, so I need the extra armor protection from getting up close to baddies and the extra carry weight from the excavator armor.
---
It also seemed to help a crap ton in the end game (nuke zones). 
---
sorry, I play on PS4. state of decay 2 is xbox exclusive
---
Definitely nerfed, but not removed. 
---
The joke is they go after mods before bulk.  The bigger joke is they have done nothing about it to date.  BGS == JOKE
---
Im not saying they arent fucky, all im saying is kill it or dont.
---
I experienced the onslaught at an early level, and it was ass. I just dont understand why everyone is crying about it like its not something you can get around later on in the game.
---
To me, its like being further along in the game to be able to handle that occurence.
---
I miss the FO3 version, such a great weapon
---
If someone had JUST dropped a nuke you would have gotten the automated warning, been able to check the map, and not walked outside, you’d be alive and junk not lost. 
---
I think you're reading too much into that .. it means you have other players thinning the heard, you're not getting EVERY SINGLE ghoul, just for you, just for your drops.
---
I've said time and time again my stance on TSE, they are easy mode weapons that ruin events for all. But, yes. In a shallow use of the world, that is your competition.
---
Though, using your logic. You, only get ONE spawn. Every OTHER PERSON, spawns more. Then the timer starts before the next time it'll spawn for you.
---
So if you stay past 1 spawn every 30 mins. You're stealing other peoples spawn. Since you yourself could not spawn them, since you already did ONCE. Neat huh?
---
You see what it weighs to you but it still takes up the original amount in the stash.
---
Xbox 1
---
Yup just mesage me and meet me at watoga station!
---
I have heard that the charging barrel is borked on all guns. Try switching it out and see if that helps.
---
Truly smiled upon you.  Congrats!
---
Yes lol, as a Str / int / lck player in character i find myself akin to Supermutants and i can imagine Supermutants thinking of all the TSE players and saying  " Weakling Humans , not fight like Supermutant, Supermutant like to Smash things for good fight, hahaha "
---
Gimme an FEV mutation plz bethesda :)
---
 Go find some trees and hide behind em' She hates that and will often land to get at you better. ;)
---
Happens to me every single day, even with 12h between playing sessions...
---
Umm.. where is the challenges menu?
---
There is the TSE build to one shot anything and TSE weapons which deal a hecka ton damage
---
Nope, don't believe so.
---
No ones asking for easy, they want them fixing! 
---
Just because you haven't had an issue with them many many people have. Its not an issue when they work as intended and its not an issue when they stick to the areas they are supposed to...its an issue when they are broken, NEVER land and seem stuck in a loop continually spitting there screech attack instead of the 3-5 times its supposed to before i moves around for another attack.
---
As for crafting cards being passive i'm not 100% sure how that would effect your role play kiddo, if they ever did change it (not sure why they would) you can just role play in your head they haven't cant you ;)
---
In my experience it's the items that are bugged, like how you can collect a mirelurk egg that bursts. It stays in your inventory but can't be eaten, cooked, or discarded. Luckily they disappear when you relog.
---
This guy gets it
---
You would need 45 strength to wield a manhole cover lol
---
I feel like two shot explosives should have some kind of downside like they only do that level of damage against scorch beasts and other big bosses (behemoths, mirelurk queens, etc.) Seems really overpowered right now.
---
Yeah when you get past 50 you start getting all kinds of legendaries. I got a bunch of instigating stuff, and others. That was my first explosive drop in 100 levels. It's not 2 shot, and it's not max level, but it's still probably strong enough with not even full level perks to one shot someone.
---
Power armor :)
---
The silos get vastly easier when you get a good gun that’s two shot, explosive, or both and maximize your damage around that gun. Otherwise it can be a bit difficult. I can run through it by myself in under a half hour now easy and not really have to worry. I actually kill myself more then enemies do lol
---
Needed? Absolutely not.
---
Useful? Yes.
---
Hazmat suits work just fine in nuke zones but it is really build dependent.
---
Got enough screws back.  Now just need springs.   Good place to farm clipboards??   Sugar grove is still empty.  
---
Well TSE renders everything else irrelevant.
---
The chat is crazy annoying. 
---
Which weird since in theory furious is made for that fight. 
---
So THAT'S how it determines where it spawns you. That... Makes a lot of sense, actually 
---
It still is very good but u need crits I just normally vats body's now still one shots most mobs but yeah I wish it would go back to being unbugged or if it's not bugged reverted to fo4 and fo3 version 
---
What makes you think i'm belly aching over it?
---
Just don't think Bethesda really care to much about what you think tbh
---
They have a massive downside. Try and shoot anything within 10 feet of yourself and you die. 
---
yeah.  I tried to make it through as much as possible without wikis and walkthroughs.  Based on the wiki and walkthroughs I started looking at, it sounded like those are the holos you need to complete it and that there is no reward but it should still complete although it doesn't complete for many people based on the order they are obtained.  
---
So far, it sounds like it didn't complete for pretty much anybody here so far so maybe the wiki was wrong or it could be a bug (hard to believe I know).  
---
If he is playing then his Mom has the poop bucket and cheesy puffs on standby :)
---
Confused though... why wouldn't you take any damage? Passive mode doesn't decrease the damage you take or eliminate it, it just makes it so you can't hurt others. Or am I mistaken? Because I've certainly been killed by another player before. 
---
Yes , all main quests now gone, I was heading toward The Belly Of The Beats quest transponders etc, now I'm stuck.
---
There is a perk that increase endurance and strenght during the day. What about that one ?
---
I tried evetything you suggested, nothing helped So far :(
---
I am waiting for some texture mod that will help mě.
---
PS: I figured out that stutter is reduced on windowed, but then FPS goes to sh#t.
---
It was freshly cooked
---
The biggest issue is communication.
---
You can't RP with emotes, mics are few and far between with the people actually willing to use them. So all you're really left with is heart emotes and standing next to them when they fire of their TSE, lol.
---
Kinda hoping we get that chat box really soon.
---
Friend kolledan
---
I haven't run into any of the things people were mentioning in the beta with people who didn't realize their mics were on. I think a lot of people have fixed theirs. I bet that would be annoying though 😅
---
And here I was filling up from the downstairs sink!   Thank you
---
Most broken mission I've come across in the game so far. I was trying to build them. Need four, had mats for six. It let me build two then the mats disappeared into the ether. Put what I had into my stash then tried to build more with some more mats I spent 30 minutes scrounging for locally. Same again. Thought "I've got two in the stash" Nope, just one now.
---
So yes. Because ignition cores are marked as junk the system cannibalised them to make more.
---
I quit the mission at that point. Life is too short.
---

---
SHIT! SHIT!! SHIT!!! I haven’t been using pack rat for this build unless I need it, and gathering all this junk out me over weight so I equipped PR2and forgot to remove it. I’m. So dumb. I’ll have to redo it and check my math. Theoretically it shouldn’t change the overall benefits. 
---
I’ve already done that bit.
---
What lvl are you? What do you enjoy doing in game?
---
There is a perk that increase endurance and strenght during the day. What about that one ? Or the one that is health healing ?
---
Id try and get a explosives bolt action pipe, great sniper
---
There was something in game that mentioned the assaultron's inability to not fuck your shit up. So, the service was shut down pre war.
---
Had the tesla rifle plan and it is no longer craftable it disappeared  got a new tesla plan and it is greyed out it will not allow me to learn it ? Playing on pc game tag is chadruzins  
---
Some people have been saying that that update is coming. 
---
The dupers are contributing to server instability, so they want to make sure that everything still runs smoothly when everyone has larger stash sizes legitimately.
---
I hear that and I will but I am a gauss fan boy.
---
I lost an extra jetpack mod because of this lame setting.
---
I can try it tonight. It’s never stopped me from making power armor before
---
It's OK! I was just showing how fast it's getting destroyed, so the damage wasn't the main point!
---
And i had luck of the draw at max level.
---
I've already tested thiswith a better build than what's listed
---
1 empath 33% damage taken -25% team
---
2 team of empath = -75% taken +33% taken = -46% taken.. 
---
3 strange in numbers shared increased empath -33% per teamate = -99% taken +33% = -66% taken 
---
4 full assassins set -8% x 5 = -40% total -106% taken
---
5 dodgy 3* -30% taken cost 30 Ap total -136% taken
---
Result?      Still gets1 shot from TSE shotgun
---
5 shot from TSE .50 cal
---
However anything non explosive is almost immune,  perfect storm hurts but slow,  
---
I don't use Power armor never will,  my DR is around 400 solo 650 team,  ER 300 solo 500 team,  I've only been killed in pvp from explosive guns,  kills the game,  TSE = no skill
---
its almost like there was a major holiday in those weeks
---
I think I got mine from workshop stuff
---
I'm maxed in heavy weapons and while the gatling laser is still hot garbage, the gatling plasma is amazing. Good damage, good speed and good fire rate.
---
Unfortunately it still breaks in 1-2 cores so I'd really like it if the gunsmith perk just worked on all non-melee weapons.
---
I actually managed to find a hella discrete steel node in the mountains that I've set up camp. Couple iron nodes nearby as well. Screws are my real issue, but that's just because I build and scrap alot so I'm just running through em quick
---
Nah that’s the problem
---
Dang. PS4 has some great exclusives too tho
---
Lvl 31, im nearly done the main campaign looking for people to do some trophies with, mainly scorched earth event, player revives and just levelling so Im game for pretty much anything.
---
Some are broken. I seem to get the dailies again if I walk into the area where they happen from far away. Not sure if that helps 
---
They shouldn’t be removed, but they should be nerfed. 
---
Some people have put in lots of effort to get these guns, and to just yank them out of everyone’s inventory isn’t reasonable.
---
Two-shot is really, really strong, but it does have downsides (very poor hipfire and much higher recoil). I’d honestly be fine with them leaving it alone. Maybe they should introduce an accuracy penalty, so that you get a more pronounced shotgun effect.
---
Explosive should have its interaction with demolition expert removed, and *all* bonus damage removed. It should make your bullet damage AoE, and that is all. 
---
Do these, and they’d still be the best guns in the game, but they wouldn’t overshadow everything else like they do now. 
---
TLDR; TSE should be nerfed, but they should still be the best in the game after the nerf. At least IMO.
---
You don’t need power armour. 
---
But don’t expect to be able to tank or carry as much.
---
I killed a high level deathclaw with a hazmat suit on and a berserker powerfirst. But yeah PA is useful in a lot of situations. I'm working on modding some regular armor with Dense or Padded for Scorchbeasts also. Also Excavator is a must have if you like to pick up a lot of stuff.
---
Maybe get an instigating exploding one? I still think ts have bad accuracy
---
The western revolver is decent if you can find a high enough levelled one. 
---
k but thx
---
Whitespring Resort sells them. Studio 58 shop. One of the lamp/light plans. 
---
I can help out if you want psn is curlitos82 
---
I noticed this with just normal gauss rifles as well I honestly want a quad exploding ts 
---
I have it I just want to know the complete downside with it. 
---
Mine crashed twice (ps4) in a row after taking grafton steel works twice.  Just gonna go wack a bunch of watoga bots for steel
---
In my line of work you have two choices:
---
1) Code freeze in the run-up to the holiday
---
2) Designated appropriate support for a high-risk release.
---
You don't just go live for the Christmas bucks and then call it a day. Well, I mean you do if the fanbase is going to roll over and take it in the ass.
---
Dunno if others have said this but your ex boyfriends should shove it, absolutely no reason to be a d*** just because you play the way you enjoy. and games always have a learning curve and sometimes it just takes some people extra time to get used to it. Keep on keeping on girl! Eventually I'm gonna see you soloed a scorch beast queen ;) 
---
Thank you! And congrats!
---
Or weightless would be nice, them fat ass rifles be to much
---
&gt; Weeks in a live service environment with major issues is a while.
---
Jumping to "they've abandoned us" after weeks is, regardless of circumstances, jumping to huge conclusions.
---
Explosive: should only be that. An explosive effect in a small area around your bullet. It should be unaffected by perks such a demolition or grenadier.
---
Two shot: I am fine with it .. though it should not be able to stack with explosive. 
---
Any TSE weapons in circulation now should be transformed into regular guns.
---
BUT this is wishful thinking .. thanks to all the idiots using EBAY for their guns. A good amount of the player base would implode if that happened "my real monies I used to buy my in game weapon, that is gone when I quit the game or the game closes". .... #Smartinvestments
---
 I ignore the whole TES deal. I may get into it, I dunno.
---
 What level is important. For low level the Hunting Rifle hits hardest and if you learn to hide while it cycles its a very good gun. Its slow though, so you need a basher and a midrange trash weapon.  Any good basher is good for bugs, molerats and dogs. Use nothing else on them. ;) A midrange pistol, with the attendant speed perks is very handy.
---
 For mid level the Shotgun stats to become very good and the Pump hits very hard set up right. If you can find a Lever Action Rifle you can toss the Hunting Rifle although they make great snipers up to high level.
---
 Upper level make sure everything is either level 50 or 45, maxxed out and modded to your needs. My Combat Shotgun, an armor piercing one, hits at 140 now and is very useful. ;)
---
Yeah I ran into him a few times while exploring the Mire. He shows up on top of the cliffs while I'm trudging down below. If that happens he disappears before I can get to him.
---
Ran into him again near a shack in the cliffs between the Mire and the Savage Divide and got super close to him and took a bunch of cool screenshots. Whacked him to death with my super sledge because he seemed eager to fight me and my buddy. Loot wasn't anything to write home about. Still a really cool encounter.
---
I've heard you can also get him as the cryptid in the Queen of the Hunt daily.
---
Can only speak for PC, but you have to be in game on a server to see the challenges menu. If you are at the main menu, it won't show up. So, however you bring up the menu from the map screen on your platform, should have the challenges option in it. 
---
Ill dm you
---
Hmmmmm
---
Lots of pieces out here of you're looking to buy, more inside.
---
That would be fine too but yeah
---
Are you potentially willing to part with it?
---
I'll second this as an excellent reply. Somebody who knows what they are talking about.
---
Buying it.
---
Workshops.
---
I don't suggest using the cheaty way, unless you wanna cheat yourself.
---
Mine works fine
---
Thank you just was curious sry for the grief...
---
Gods be praised.
---
Lots of bloatflies. But you can also tag it for search, I believe multiple items have it.
---
My main weapon is the Gatling I don’t really use a sniper or shotgun cuz the my Gatling does 100 damages. For bullets I’d say(don’t remember you saying it) take the card ammosmith in agility, you craft 180% the ammo you craft normally
---
I don't know which patch it was that fixed it, but I remember I had PA chasis stacking and one or more of them were phantom frames that didn't exist but still took up carry weight on both my person or my stash. 
---
Charging barrel crashes it. Use something else for now
---
I've encountered him walking down the road by the first overseer's camp. I guess he can be just about anywhere.
---
Only thing on my map I can find that says bog is a place named Abandoned Bog Town and the closest lookout tower I have to it is Ranger Look out but I don't see a garden near it
---
&gt;I think you're reading too much into that .. it means you have other players thinning the heard, you're not getting EVERY SINGLE ghoul, just for you, just for your drops and insane amount of exp.

&gt; I've said time and time again my stance on TSE, they are easy mode weapons that ruin events for all. But, yes. In a shallow use of the world, that is your competition.

In some MMOs I played big events that could be farmed were usualy organized with one leader who circled around each spawns with everyone in squad following so all shared loot &amp; exp. Thought it could've been fine to experience nuke zones like that.
---
Going live and then going on holiday might as well be abandoning the game in a live service model.
---
By defend events did you mean taking the workshop from someone else or claiming it? By defend events did you mean the standard event that takes place once you claim it? How did you specifically farm him? 
---
I work with my mother, selling fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work.

Sounds like you got your *shit* together!

Or maybe you might like

You really know your SHIT!

Get surrounded by ghouls and can’t eat out or heal or reload?
---
Jump them all while using a stimpak and reloading then sit on a roof and pick them off 
---
&gt; TES are just superior.
---
well i think fallout gives that series a run for its money at least
---
Lol probably be picking on Scott titorman
---
I got disconnected over 3 times doing the DMV mission in Charleston and had to repeat ALL of the steps...as if I was actually at the DMV...
---
I run Speed Demon and Marsupial for ultimate mobility 
---
A dropped item disappears after you're away from it for a while. Put it in the till in front of a vendor. Stays until you DC from the server.
---
Why a big update this month? they've confirmed the lever action rifle animation will be fixed...haven't said a word about anything else in the update.
---
this shit is so broken it pisses me off man.
---
It’s possible to play without Power armour but considering how helpful the armour is even without all the mods I’d recommend you take advantage of it. 
---
Read it again. that stuff isn't coming in the next update. Its whats coming this year.
---
I wouldn't exactly call someone a 'literal genius' for making a high-tech energy gun that breaks after 2-3 clips of shooting with it.
---
Players cannot damage you directly ,,, indirectly im not so sure.
---
But i cannot engage in pvp either.
---
If your fighting a Scorch Queen its useful as you will not kill or be killed by other players allowing you to Orbital strike / fat man the Queen without worrying about killing the guys who have accidentally shot you in the chaos of the Scorch Queen screaming in the battle.
---
There's one or two in the Morgantown high school cafeteria (if it hasn't recently been picked clean). I also find them a lot in the blue lunch boxes.
---
For me I reliably find him using this technique.
---
1. Create an alt that has basically no money.
---
2. Play for 5 minutes.
---
3.?????
---
4. Profit. 
---
Bethesda trying to catch a fade
---
I think the stash limit was set low for 2 reasons.  1) Server stability, when trading with those 200000+ lb people it goes so slow.
---
2) Encourage trading among other players.  Give an excess of what you have for what you need.
---
Notice I put I think, I am probably wrong.
---
Dupers are going to do what they want, our opinions don’t matter.  I just play my game and let them play theirs.
---
Yeah crashing when owning 6-8 is a pain in the ass especially if you haven't collected enough material for it to be worth the investment
---
 Yup I used it yesterday. Pulled out the Blade and went to town and its still pretty quick like that, used for travel.
---
 I may try running through it next time but I was heavy ;)
---
Im lvl 120, and the Caverns is one of a couple of not visited places left on the map. I just despise cave type areas and the place will remain undiscovered for me
---
Except that they came back after the holiday. Therefore, it's clearly not abandoned.
---
You can be salty, no one is saying you can't. You just don't need to be melodramatic about it.
---
I'm level 66 and there is nothing to do. I have no quests that aren't daily's, or repeatable misc. 
---
Helping other people is how I get my kicks from the game now. Teaming up with lower levels even if it's just to wander around gives me a a reason to play. I've met some super cool people this way that I really enjoy playing with.
---
I looked it up, it’s East Mountain Lookout. It’s west of Kerwood Mine.  East of West Tek Research Center.
---
*Sigh*
---
Yet another post with wrong info. You had pack rat on. Pack rat SCREWS UP rounding. Here are the actual junk weights.
---
Component / Per Unit Weight / Bulk Unit Return / Bulk Weight / Weight of Returned Components
---
Acid / 0.05 / 15 (costs 10 to make though) / 0.75 / 0.75
---
Adhesive / 0.05 / 10 / 0.5 / 0.5
---
Aluminum / 0.1 / 10 / 0.5 / 1
---
Bone / 0.05 / 20 / 1 / 1
---
Ceramic / 0.05 / 15 / 0.75 / 0.75
---
Cloth / 0.05 / 30 / 1.5 / 1.5
---
Concrete / 0.05 / 15 / 0.75 / 0.75
---
Copper / 0.1 / 10 / 1 / 1
---
Cork / 0.03 / 10 / 0.3 / 0.3
---
Fertilizer / 0.1 / 20 / 2 / 2
---
Gear / 0.1 / 10 / 1 / 1
---
Glass / 0.05 / 15 / 0.75 / 0.75
---
Lead / 0.1 / 20 / 1 / 2
---
Leather / 0.05 / 15 / 0.75 / 0.75
---
Oil / 0.1 / 10 / 1 / 1
---
Plastic / 0.05 / 10 / 0.5 / 0.5

---
Steel / 0.05 / 30 / 1.5 / 1.5
---
Wood / 0.05 / 30 / 1.5 / 1.5
---
As you can see ONLY Lead and Aluminum weigh more unbulked than bulked. And plastic is a cost of bulking, you don't get it back, so you don't actually save weight from the plastic when bulking since it's gone at that point.
---
In short, bad info collecting here and the post is wrong.
---
I’ve seen a case where someone had the same happen to them.  Got mutation, died, on respawn and server hop the mutation still wasn’t there.
---
Was made even worse because they couldn’t get the mutation no matter what AND couldn’t get rid of it...hope this hasn’t happened to you
---
You need the enforcer perk.  At 3 stars it pretty much instantly cripples limbs on anything.  Pop whatevers after you in both legs then drop your grenades in its face, MIRV frags work best.
---
Yup! These non damage stats would be amazing. I really miss the new vegas damage vs damge per second stat as well.
---
Ive found a coupke of 2 shot things like a 2 shoy cryolator, i havent actually found any explosive weapons yet but i bought an explosive dragon from a railway vendor
---
Could even be a perk card tbh
---
Tse or bloodied.
---
Corollary: yellow is not “normal” for the color of pee. It’s supposed to be clear.
---
Drink more water, you dehydrated fucks.
---
Sweet, thanks! I am hunting for headlight mods.
---
Wendigos are a convenient way since their teeth have acid. You can usually find them at Whitesprings.
---
Thank you :) I'll check out there as well
---
he’s talking about between the cranberry bog and savage divide
---
I found melon blossoms but I sadly can't plant those
---
I can make a Gauss Rifle from scratch but I can't make a pillow or linens for my bed.  IJS....
---
If they were actually serious about this game as a long-term, successful live-service then they would have either had staff on over the holiday or not released until January when they could actually support the game properly.
---
This just shows the game is a merciless cash grab and Bethesda probably can't believe their luck that the fans will defend their shocking business decisions and practices at every turn.
---
I'll check out there :)
---
There is a Vault-Tec bed and there is a Vault-Tec bed 2 plan. You may have purchased the wrong one. 
---
Yes, please and if you could also tell us about the dognetflix beast that would be great, too!
---
&gt;as if I was actually at the DMV...
---
lol
---
Camp McLintock has boxes of clipboards 
---
seems pretty weird for a synth to say that.
---
.. nah I dont see any missing context. You are nitpicking just to nitpick.
---
By definition it is a cartoon. Thats just a fact. I always greet with suspicious eyes, those that jump to the defence (needed or otherwise) of anime.
---
Level 70 atm, i found about \~4 two-shot weapons (only 1 with max level, tho) and only a single explosive weapon. (level 20)
---
Yesterday i have found my best rifle so far, a level 40 two shot combat rifle. It's my main weapon now.
---
I found all of them at... whitespring legendary feral ghouls.
---
I don't do any trading. the game economy is fucked up...
---
Oh thought it was in the next update 😊😁
---
That’s pretty creative actually.
---
I went by a few minutes ago. It's dirty water, so if you collect it, that's what you get. It does gives rads.
---
Well there's Rose and Grahm. Not human but still NPCs.
---
ive seen people be very predatory to new players because they simply dont know how the game works. its honestly pretty gross. i try to help new people out as much as possible, dropping ammo, purified water, stims and radaway for them if they show interest in interacting with me. im level 201 and love the game.
---
 OK. I just don the X0-1 for high rad areas. The armor my baby wears is all hers and is pretty nice outside of high rad areas.
---
 MY crafter in fact. 
---
I can do a queen run for 1k
---
So one can drop at any time at levels 25+?
---
and we just had Christmas and new years, both fell on patch day...  
---
idgaf. it's a video game. 
---
Lucky hole mine and excavator armour. 350 lead per run
---
I thought it was A reward and an apology for having to deal with those two 
---
*Pushes up nerd glasses* Well technically I think the lore reason for Mutations is that we have already been infected by the more benign/less aggressive Mutated FEV that was released when a Chinese nuke blew open a West Tek research facility on the west coast. 
---
I also wanted to add my Name, all I recieved was the Plan for the Minigun, some ammo and chems... This suxx 😑
---
The missiona for it starts at the garrahan mining hq in the very south of the map.
---
Grateful dead concert.
---
&gt;it's a video game
---
Debatable.
---
You get it after the Miner Miracles Quest.
---
You get it for completing Miner Miracles. Along with the set of Excavation PA. 
---
Whenever I try to do certain missions, I stand out side and server hop till it starts. A lot of events don't start till someone's close by. 
---
Just found the tunnel today but it’s really starting to annoy me because I can’t find the last body
---
I would LOVE more raider shit. Random pikes with bodies on them, cages full of meat or my dead enemies like super mutants or death claws. Unique, fun stuff. We need more decor stuff.
---
Or you buy it in the enclave bunker anytime if you want.
---
The weeks have also been during the holidays.  They've been shutdown.  
---
Yet I disagree. It is a cartoon. But it's a Japanese cartoon and whether you like adjectives or not, that distinction does matter when discussing art and culture. I never disagreed. I just care about the details.
---
Also, since when is nitpicking bad if you're still agreeing with the overall premise?
---
I used to have 2k .308... Then the light machine gun nation attacked 
---
Or you buy it from the bos vendor at Watoga lol
---
You get it for completing the excavator power armour quest. There are other quests but that's the one I can 100% remember it from.
---
the two shot makes the spread worse. almost like hip fire spread.
---
i feel like letting the enemies take it over then doing the retake event is way faster
---
Also remember to join my patreon if you enjoy this video, and follow me on twitch so you can give me money live.
---
&gt;idgaf.
---
that isn't debatable.
---
Hmm, perhaps they shouldn't have released a live-service game with major known issues just before the holidays. But then they wouldn't have got all that sweet Christmas cash from the players. Those same players that have expectations so low that they will happily roll over and let a company run roughshod over them and basic industry standards in the name of profit.
---
Hemlock holes workshop has 3 extractors. 
---
People trade items in discord.  I spent 1500 caps (and provided the mats) for some calibrated shock ultracite power armor legs.  There are also people selling their TSE weapons.  Anyway just saying its sometimes in game trades (especially with discord making it easier to find other players)  - but yeah, finding just one TSE weapon is hard - but grinding out caps for a week and then buying one is possible :P    
---
Anyway, I had a guy blipping around my base one shotting all my walls and stuff, I turned off pacifist and then one shot him with my bloodied hammer.    It happens :P  No need to make retaliation posts with names or anything though xD
---
It is since you seem to still be posting.
---
Hemlock Holes + bulk all your acid for that +5 free stuff. 
---
Helps if you move your camp to an acid extractor too.
---
Love hate, no doubt.. 
---
i worked 6 days of those 2 weeks, every company is different in how they handle holidays, my friends office job just had both weeks completly off.  not really a stock reply more of a common sense reply.  
---
the first week after the holiday they drop an "out of the vault" saying we will get a major patch mid-late january.  sure sounds like the abandoned the game huh? /s
---
Also farm the grafton monster that spawns at charleston
---
Its why I have a Jet Pack on my X0-1. I can get higher ... ;)
---
Interesting, I did not know that.  Thanks for the reply.  I am using rejuvenated for the AP and food with AP regen.  Do you know what the AP regen soft cap is? 
---
However, the 20% for dmg resist stacked with blocker makes all the suicide style melee mobs a lot less painful too.  When grouped I switch it out with other chr perks but that seemed the best solo running around.
---
It splits your shot into two.
---
It’s funny I posted this on the fallout reddit also and got attacked
---
Bethesda already stated that game play changing mods would be restricted to Private servers, Which i'm completely fine with. I'd rather play a game that is functioning properly with a couple of my friends, instead of a game with 23 others that is utterly broken to the point where their severs are crashing constantly. And if Bethesda does private servers right we should be able to host Public-"Private" servers with a higher player limits.
---
But the same problem persists with 1 shot ones.
---
Well it's small and boring so I don't blame you. 
---
Oh man. I have chronic migraines, and I avoid that area like the plague because it's such a trigger!
---
You know.
---
I'd be happy with a mutation that would let us climb. Much like in Dying Light. I do love marsupial and all but some diversity is awesome. 
---
Don't wanna jump like a kangaroo? Climb like a spider instead!
---
Hmmm very intresting. As I usually fight the ghouls without PA, they give me all the time that disease that increases rad damage, and that sucks. It will come handy, I know the building but never seen anything you'd try to drink from inside it.
---
This has been done but I can’t find the link. Please make this work. I will be following this post closely. Good luck. 
---
Sorry OP but my CAMP is at the top of the world so i can free fast travel to the center of the map and have a reasonable pruce for fast travelling to anywhere on the map, if you see me there just come to my camp and ask for some assistance clearing who or whatever is stopping you ill gladly lend a hand
---
Here for this 😍
---
The middle column (So the left set of numbers) is the weight difference before you factor in the plastic and 14 have a weight drop there and only acid having a weight gain.
---
you keep blowing up my phone, cutie
---
What's about these modes?
---
Humans will tend to gather in groups rather than be lone souls... Yes, some will, but overall, most of us would try to clean things up and build some kind of community. I am hoping that we will have that ability in the game soon... Instead of not letting us build anyplace near anyone else.
---
I’m online 
---
I’ll third that.
---
por que no las dos?
---
&gt; my friends office job just had both weeks completly off
---
And I bet they didn't decide to make huge changes just before that period.
---
Check out any software service line, see how they handle holiday periods. They will have code freezes and skeleton crews because no one in their right mind will modify the core service and then sod off for a fortnight.
---
I want to make a comment about RNG luck here, but it’s bad RNG luck to even *talk* about it.
---
So...instead I’ll just say congrats!
---
There should be a cut off where you still have ownership of the workshops for 5 minutes after going offline with a chance to rejoin the server
---
Ya I get that but does the second shot do the same amount of damage as the first one say 120 for my lever action or is it the base damage of say 80 or lower without mods for the rifle?
---
Still better than the shooting mechanic in Fallout 3 and New Vegas lmao you’d lose your mind 
---
B-b-but I really don't care, honest.
---
I mean.
---
Hazmat. 
---
Also dude that TLDR is way to fucking long, lol. You have a sentence followed by TLDR, rude! XD
---
You forgot your system
---
Welsh station in  ash heap is where i got my plans
---
Lol that sucks man. But good luck! Let us know what flavor revenge you get.
---
He clearly was using the Whitesprings Railroad Station as his personal player farming area.
---
I was speccing for rifle build all the way and have an explosive mutant's lever action that could generally take out a Whitespring window horde in two or three shots (only when other players aren't around)...and then I found a pitchfork with I think AP and 50% extra power swing damage and have started to use it pretty much exclusively.
---
Can't wait till we get enough items and arrive at Redstone levels of engineering
---
What i wanna know is how you managed to get a TSE of 3 very good weapons
---
make sure to scan the floor at mclintock, some are hard to see.
---
Fuck it, I ain't changing it, let everyone see my shame. 
---
I’m the same. Can’t deal with the anxiety of knowing how little charge I have on my fusion core. Literally have about 6 with half charge 😬
---
They sure hamfisted in Whitespring as the only endgame location huh?
---
Thank you, I’ve had that mission for a few days but haven’t done it
---
Appears that way - look at Responder vendors for it.  Just might be a less common item - I don't see anything that tells me what the odds are for each item.
---
I think I'm having the same problem.   Game has been crashing a lot since I had gotten one too.
---
You could improve it a bit. Explain the perks you should have. And if you are trying to speak on the video, it's too quiet.
---
idgaf
---
&gt; I do wish there was something to prevent a squabble from becoming a 2hr battle of attrition. 
---
Change servers.
---
So you keep saying but your seeming insistence to absolutely without question get the last word in begs to differ.
---
Def should come with the faction wars dlc coming. U would like faction ranks with exclusive rewards too kinda like destiny 1 did with future warcult dead orbit and new monarchy 
---
I dont think they should be removed because it would just cause an undue amount of baby rage from those who solely rely on those. I do think however that they could put them both on the same modifier slot to make it more balanced, instead of making it a tse, make it ts or e. This would at least allow for a more varied amount of viable weapons and not make a shotgun one shot you from a mile away (hopefully). Again though, this would cause a large amount of baby rage but hopefully not as much as the removal of them.
---
Looking to trade torso plans for limbs. Foden333 on pc. 
---
I'm level 79 and found a TS machine gun at White Springs but not explosive and the recoil on the thing is crazy.
---
Different pure flux is used to craft different things.
---
I tried it for the first time earlier and the guy I was co-opting with suddenly went quiet and some woman, I assume his mum, was going absolutely ballistic at him over something. Quickly turned it off 😂
---
Right my bad it's Xbox 1
---
Gamma gun is terrible. The only thing it is good for is trolling players with radiation damage. You should not be using it to fight other players. That was a terrible idea on your part
---
what can i say, i'm enjoying our time together
---
Does anyone have a screen cap of the fountain?
---
Should point you in another direction did you listen to both holo tapes?
---
Will do!
---
The fact you left out raiders has made me sad...
---
It took me a bit to figure out that it is 2 legit projectiles and not just 1 doing double damage. We all know that the ts vats is bugged atm, but I also started to notice that when aiming; the farther away the target the more likely my second bullet shanked. Idk why, but it happens. 
---
Just go to Charleston and buy one for 600 caps or come to my camp and I'll give you one for free. I don't see the hype..
---
what? no..
---
Every time friends come to my camp they spawn randomly around the place
---
Clearly.
---
Will do from now on. Didn't know they poofed. Thanks!!!
---
You know what, I'm going to edit the post and make some raider suggestions because a lot of comments have been made about raider decor too
---
Opens a Detective Case files; Chinese Advances in Mutations and the study of mutated Biological cell enhancement. ,,,, Wheres the Quest for the Serum Mutation Accelerator ... Dun dun dunnn.
---
I hope you're right, that could be an interesting way for bethesda to go forward with mutations in the game &amp; it makes for good Scifi story telling.  
---
I'm not saying they're in the right or anything.  All I'm saying is that it has been the holidays and that's why we haven't seen updates.  Personally I wonder how much bug testing they actually did because this game shouldn't have been released as is.  The glitches people have been doing to level or at least duping have from what read been in the engine since Fallout 4 and were never fixed.  
---
truth, mine is doing it too, never knew why
---
run up to the door at the fast travel spot, some people have said it pops after they went in the door.
---
I mean my first bullet doesn't even hit and even when not using a two shot the normal gausses have the same issue.
---
Yo, your post prompted me to do one to get the right info out. Double check my data against your revised data.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adatf9/actual_junk_weight_versus_bulk_weight_comparison/
---
Whose fighting over workshops? They aren't even remotely worth the hassle.
---
Defend events from enemy mobs attacking, not players. He will spawn eventually on one of your fast travels (I just found more likely on an event). When he does spawn and doesn't have the plans you want, you'll need to server hop and repeat the process - took him a while to have the plans I wanted annoyingly.
---
You can add me, King_Blu28. I try to get on at least for a bit everyday
---
Is artillery actually effective in there if you hit the roof?
---
Maybe one day Bethesda will make a proper RPG of Fallout and let us play different races. I mean, they’re already all in there. Ghoul, Super Mutant, robots, synths even.
---
I would actually really love one! My boyfriend actually found one randomly, and was going to give it to me, but of course the thing feel through the damn floor 🙄🙄 so I have actually been in the hunt for one for myself and him. If you’re serious about crafting them, I would be super grateful! And yes I’m on PC
---
Hell I’m level 46 and I didn’t know there were responder vendors 
---
Thanks.  I'll start trying that instead of the vendor. 
---
That would be great to have 
---
Seems like it is unarmed (bit late to the party but just got an instigating one!)
---
I disagree.  I’ve fought off several players before with it.  This individual must of had some great armor and a power fist because all he was doing was taking swings at me.  I should have just obliterated him at the start considering it’s automatic.  I could have made him a puddle before he could arm whatever he was using.  Never again...no hesitation.
---
my camp is at the junk node nearby so I've always captured it
---
didnt even realize this
---
Huh, I haven't used the gauss so I won't be helpful in that respect. They're the guns with the slower projectiles, right? If that's the case it could have weird interactions with the environment as it travels.
---
The displayed bounty always gets cut by 50% when I get in range.   Might just be a display bug. Or something else going on. 
---
They would break peoples backs lol
---
I can be right next to them at 95 in sneak or whatever and miss their head lol body always hits so idk 
---
That looks like what I‘m seeing... stupid pack rat. Nice work. 
---
Look into r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Bunch of laid back players.
---
Wonderful! Are you on PC? Sorry if you said and I missed it. 
---
I’ve been interested to find fun people to play with. I’ve run into just a few randomly.  I haven’t played as much and I’d hoped to. I’m also injured pretty badly and navigating different specialists is taking its toll.  I hope you’re back on your feet, literally, soon. 
---
I’m also an independent woman, also was adopted (by dysfunctional weirdos) and I love to explore the map, quest and talk about whatever random stuff. 
---
I love this. You can get really close to those you play online games with. I just recently teamed up with a group of girls to play RDR2 online with and have a bunch of new friends now. I’m hoping Rockstar comes out with a computer version so I can convince my dad to play online with me. 
---
I just soaked in sulfer water at natural hot springs. 
---
Damn, that sucks. Probably bugged atm, I know a lot of energy weapons are. 
---
It would show your friend that you are not on the map. If I were you, I would turn my status offline before I go off for the night and when I log back on, keep the offline status so your friend doesn't know your are currently on. It's worked a couple of time for me.
---
Thanks, sounds good. 
---
Are you on Xbox? If you want to spice things up, add me. GT is SpicyPapaCake. Trust me, you'll have an interesting time.
---
&gt;All I'm saying is that it has been the holidays and that's why we haven't seen updates. 
---
Which is just proof that Bethesda isn't actually serious about a live-service game. Imagine if Microsoft pushed an update on December 22nd that forced Microsoft Word to force Wingdings as a font. And imagine if they didn't push a fix until January 7th. Would that count as 'a while'?
---
Everything's for sale, my friend. 
---
Sounds good
---
Cheers for the feedback, the audio was a bit low because of an editing error, and yeah I wanted to explain more but didnt want to drag it on a bit. 
---
Me either. I don't see the hype. I just use one to tag legendaries.
---
Yeah :/ idc about energy weapons besides my gauss rifle I loved that monster in every fallout. Gauss riflemen and gunslinger builds are my fav .
---
Yeah, we know. There is even a [nice spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/edit#gid%3D0)
---
don't run out of steam now, big guy, let's keep it going
---
Xbox1?
---
I’m just looking for a fun, free run
---
It has pretty good DPS it seems, and it doesn't look like a grease gun. Plus it has some kind of cap where you'll no longer find it for sale at vendors, so its giving it a "rare" type effect. 
---
I got about 9 screws from McClintock 
---
I think it is a pretty good game. Certainly got my money's worth.
---
Should point out that pacifist mode doesn't prevent other people from attacking or even killing you. It just prevents you from damaging others, which means outside of pvp areas (like workshops) other players damage to you is heavily reduced, but not eliminated.
---
THAT WOULD BE TOO CONFUSING FOR OUR NON-RPG PLAYERS
---
Springs*
---
You probably shouldn't have farmed mutations without having the perk first. You're going to regret it.
---
I am not entirely sure.  I know someone posted on here a few weeks back with a huge comparison with the two perks selected at the same time and you are only gaining single digits more ap regen over just having action boy alone.  Not sure how rejuv stacks.
---
Best glitch in the game, happened to my friend and all he had on was a T-51 helmet 
---
Do you wash your mother with that mouth 
---
&gt;I feel like this would be more immersive
---
Yes, playing with Poon Ninja and Doctor Donkey Kong would be *so* much more immersive. 
---
I just looked up some other posts and videos.   I'm seeing multiple people showing testing results with different outcomes. I will run some tests tonight and see if I can see any difference.  However, now that you bring it up, there probably is a soft cap.  Thanks again for the heads up!  I'll report my results.
---
15-19, confirmed on my alt.
---
You're talking 2 different issues.  One is a game and the other is software that business's use.  Would I say ti's a while, no. What I would say is that they should have tested the update first and probably shouldn't have put the update out before leaving for the holidays.  
---
Yeah, but people don't know. Someone just posted a table of wrong info about an hour ago and was getting a lot of people going "thanks for the info" and such. He had pack rat equipped on his table. Gotta stamp out that misinformation.
---
I like 1-shotting users of explosive weapons with my melee build ha ha.... I see your power armour.... well, actually, I don't!
---
Ive experienced them working incorrectly, ive never experienced it as a problem once i was able to kill one regardless of how its functioning. Once i hit the point in game where the scorchbeast wasnt "undefeatable", the reoccurring issues when dealing with a SB arent that serious that one should quit playing the game over.
---
it's widely considered the best "rifle" (automatic OR semi-automatic), is only available from vendors from level 15 to 45, and doesn't look like a vacuum tube
---
You need to scarp weapons and armor to get a lot of mods for them, so being able to make your own is good for unlocking all of the mods for a particular item.
---
It’s the highest sustained dps rifle for a rifle build, semi or automatic.
---
😱 IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THEM FOR AGES!! XD 
---
They should be, I know there was a bug where a set of conduits and the barn set were assigned the same name (not sure if bethesda have fixed it)
---
So it’s actually quite possible I outleveled it on my way to Harper’s because I stopped by to get the voice of set data and things on the way. 
---
1st try today.  I had two  hand mades drop while I was out walking the Bog,  One from a Wendingo and one from a duffel bag. Decided it must be my lucky day and Ft’d to the prison and it popped.
---
I waiver between both camps, but I'm come to the conclusion that it depends on the combination and what weapon they're on. 
---
For example a plain 2 shot LAR is good, but not op and usually caps out around 250ish. My explosive assault rilfe only does 198 damage. I don't think these are op as they don't one shot anything in a nuked zone. Now we get to my explosive combat shotgun, with perks it does about 440ish damage/pellet (and a combat rile shoots 6 i think) which cranks up the damage to being too op. Then with the TSE combo it definitly must be removed, or at least negated during pvp. 
---
Long story short; in my opinion invividually on weaker weapons these effects arent too bad, but the combinatins that can occur are busted. 
---
There are conduits and advanced conduits. Apparently. Did some research on lunch
---
It’s the same on Xbox
---
There's a turn into another section about midway through that you need to go into from the ash heap side, follow the tunnel until you get to the area that looks like a big cavern with catwalks and locked doors. Follow the path to the right. If you're in any area that's flooded, that's not it.
---
There's some machinery there and more scorched to heal with.
---
So basically having people dupe smaller amounts would have no effect on crashing the server 😂. 
---
Whenever I hit people, I wouldn’t get a bounty though. Only when I kill them with slap damage or damage their base, I’ll get a bounty. If I did get a bounty, the game would notify me that I have a bounty. At that time, it never notified me that I had a bounty. 
---
&gt;e to ex
---
In the wrong context I could see that. Something like "I just got learnt".
---
So you would claim a workshop, and then wait till a defense event occurred, and fast traveled back? Thanks again my dude for the helping everyone lol &lt;3
---
I found 2 melons and a melon blossom at East Mountain Lookout :D
---
My base is at Whitesprings and I have a golf bag within the perimeter (golf bag on a golf cart). I use this as my freebie bag for passing players. I got the giant marquee arrows just so people know to check it for stuff. I often put in ammo, plans, recipes, armor, etc. I am not sure if people ever take anything but i hope someone does. I heard even if I leave the server, the stuff should remain in there. Not sure if this is true.
---
I’d just settle for a matched set, I’ve got a variety of pieces.
---
Can’t you just message him saying you want to play solo today?
---
I ran into him the other nigh. He just stood there as I missiled him do death.
---
Drop wasn't anything special.
---
On ps4 &amp; my mic us always on. Not a chatty person at all but you will hear me cursing &amp; swearing in bad situations I put myself in or laughing at things I find amusing. Have only chatted with a small amount of people, most wave/thumbs up &amp; we go our seperate ways.
---
Epic.
---
Fuck no
---
What objects do you have in your camp?
---
Okay thank you, I’ll look
---
That was the last brotherhood quest. There is no bug. Brotherhood quest is also the main quest you just jumped around a little. 
---
Now you need to find the enclave.
---
That one is bugged for some reason, are you looking for the bed that has the blue vault tec sheets? That one is currently called “modern bed plans”
---
Mines not quite so mobile, but I’m running with a fantastic little 2x3 CAMP that I’m just in love with. Certainly a little crowded, but has all of the amenities a Dweller would want for adventuring, with a little extra decoration thrown in.
---
If you’re on PC, I’d be happy to give you a tour.
---
Well fuck. Makes sense why I couldn't find them lol thanks for the info!
---
And since I'm not on PS4 I'll sadly never be able to visit your shop haha cheers though and happy hunting on the wasteland!
---
Yeah sure, but it would open up the possibility for more immersion. I’d rather see those goofy names than “ xX_mast3r_killer420Xx” lol
---
just normal stuff and an extractor. all walls and everything are floating 
---
Oh that's what it was
---
My guess would be players at Whitesprings are not playing the game so much as they are defending real world money through their farming exploits, so they are super aggressive.
---
That whole place leaves a bad taste.
---
unless it gets nerfed, you can play a stealth commando build and clear any content (except scorch queen, she'll one-shot you unless you don't mind losing junk) in a radiation suit. you'll kill EVERYTHING before it even knows where you are, just target the head in VATS and spam criticals
---
&gt;  One is a game and the other is software that business's use.
---
No difference, same issue. The issue is pushing out broken code before going on holiday. Unless you are saying that gamers should have lower standards for some reason. I mean, they do have lower standards, but it baffles me why. Happy to pay more for less. Happy to not receive services paid for. Happy to be sold even more crap for even more money. Happy to tell everyone else that if they don't like being treated like a wallet attached to a keyboard then they can just go somewhere else.
---
Can Do is also great. The storable food is useful to have but there's also a chance you can get stims out of it. And there are a ton of coolers and trash bins around.
---
Hemlock holes 
---
This confused me at first too. 
---
Plan: Vault-Tec Bed is a basic bed.
---
Plan: Vault-Tec Bed 2 is the bed that has the blanket with the logo on it. 
---
The first one is definitely happening. It's a bug since beta. I can hardly every team with my real life friends in game. So we just use PlayStation parties. It's harder to coordinate actions in game. We can keep lone wanderer on but can't share cards.
---
Anyone have any tips for a new player? I am looking for a way to level up quickly but I keep dying in whitespring. 
---
That's a great idea! Being able to also display PA frames on PA stations would be great too.
---
There are other ways to tell if a person is a weeb or immature by the way, everyone could “shrug”. Next time this happens to me, I’ll provide video evidence.
---
My hour of server hopping wasn't all waisted. I did get the marine armor chest, arms and legs. I'm going to try the prison tomorrow and hope the event comes up. 
---
Micromanaging the Stash does get a bit tiresome, when the Vendors have limited caps I'm always dumping stuff, sad we no longer have displays for our nicest items.
---
Yeah but specifically Sunshine Meadows as I had him consistently spawning at least once per server. 
---
Level up my dude, most have to put in the work before getting the opportunity. It costs materials to kill queen.
---
This happened to me today as well and for "Belly of the Beast" quest. Pretty bummed, I have to start BotB over again and I know I was close to finishing. 
---
Railway spikes up the side of that beast?! Don't sell yourself short! You are now ready for Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's new Titan Games. Get on it! &gt;:D
---
Huh? No. It is the method they use to dupe that causes server problems. But thee are also a bunch of other problems with the servers. It doesn't matter if they dupe 1 thing and turn it into 2 or if they dupe 500 and turn it into 1000. The method they use is the exact same.
---
The vendor in Harper’s Ferry carries them, too. 
---
Unrelated, but, can you VATS while zoomed on a scope?
---
Think the Chemist perk takes lvl 30 or 32 though, gonna take a while.
---
yeah thanks. what vendor sells that
---
I don’t farm for legendaries usually because I don’t find it fun. So the only time I encountered a gun that was decent was after killing the queen. I don’t think I will ever find a legendary that will work for me at this point haha.
---
If you search in here someone has made a comprehensive map of most underwater locations already. 
---
You can put your camp pretty close to the Responder corpse on the stairs there. It's where mine is and I've just got free food and water for people to start their journeys
---
Okay, wow. The photo I've seen before of that particular dog made it seem a lot larger than that. Ha!
---
Always been like that for me, watching Super *heavy* Mutants falling like giant feathers is hilarious.
---
Pretty sure this one can appear at any vendor, watoga BOS vendor is a good one for camp stuff
---
Where do you go to check serum prices and sell?
---
Bryan Cranston would be proud.
---
Oh dangit
---
Definitely! In addition to decoration purposes I think it’s a cool way to log your progress in the game, showing the weapons and armor you’ve gathered and used through your journey in the wasteland. 
---
Ill check it out
---
Where do you get t51b pa plans?
---
Does it show marsupial under "effects" on your pipboy?
---
Aha. Sure.
---
and then I'd have to wait for the nuke to subside.
---
or Bethesda could, you know, fix their full-priced mess.
---
You can find some anti-scorched mods on the Fire Breathers / Responders corpses.
---
They're mentioned when you get the pistol mod, but I'd completely forgotten them until I took the tunnel.
---
Went to take the abandoned munitions factory yesterday to churn out some 5.56. It was taken when I got there, but the guy who had it was done, he just basically handed it over to me. I made my 200 rounds of 5.56 and, if someone else had come along, I would've gladly let them have it.
---
You don't have to fight over the workshops.
---
any scorched or ghoul that is sat perfectly still will be launched on death, and liberators seem to always glide when falling. It seems worse than it was in fallout 4 oddly enough
---
But they're playing an RPG?
---
Gauss rifles have bad accuracy and two shot makes it even worse. Using a two shot gauss in vats will almost never hit
---
I Just thaught it was a funny story to tell... I had no need or intent of retaliation i got a laugh from his stupidity and decided to share the story... &amp; I didn't mention his psn name so just Daz is as good as anonymous.. So effectively there was no naming and shaming,,, only Daz will know who Daz is..
---
I get it people are free to play n trade how they want.. but when you're buying TSE weapons from possibly a duper who's selling 20 TSE weapons of every different weapon and his 100 jetpacks.. thats completely different to legitimate trading as you have done.... and right now i feel for the legitimate traders having to deal with dupers.
---
Lol, still going, huh?
---
I have a 2SE laser rifle, it is still pretty terrible. Only benefit to it is that it weighs 7 pounds.
---
*Nerd Rage ensues 
---
While wearing the Power Armor with the low core, logout of game. When you log back in it will be recharged to 100%. Be it a glitch or intentional it is very useful.
---
there was one that many a true nerd found in his latest video had some background on BOS
---
But it's the same ts or no ts. Not only that is if I just tap the gun it hits Everytime . If it's charged that's when it misses. Accuracy or not if it says 95 it should hit but a week of this has shown it's bugged or something
---
Hey that sounds awesome! Yeah definitely add me 😃
---
Yeah I ran into a guy yesterday who only lives a few hours away from me and turns out we're both into industrial and EBM and I found the first person who's heard of Die Krupps and And One besides me in my life 😅
---
I run into so many nice people. 
---
I was crafting some handmade rifles for people last night and many of them insisted on giving me something in return. I told them I only accept dog food haha
---
I had people all game messaging me to party up and they fast travelled and dropped me all the dog food they found while on their adventure haha.
---
I can see the SBQ being a weekly thing. Like she just pops out and starts laying waist to everything and everyone. Something like she comes out to feed so see seeks out players and their camps. Only problem is what happens when it's a server full of noobs or just low level casual players. .... Maybe not such a good idea after all.
---
Thanks warboy! 
---
He hooked me up with multiple weapons, and took me to a nearby mine to farm XP!
---
+1 for living it.
---
oki same here
---
Marine and trapper armour can reach rad resist levels on par with power armour, and with the right gear and perks you can surpass T-45 in terms of defence by about your level. Excavator has the benefit of extra carry weight but you could also use deep pocketed (but you lose rad resist over lead lined)
---
Does he ever get harder to kill? So far it's just been shoot at him then go in a shop and finish him safely through a window. 
---
A friend and I recently spotted one of these silos from a lookout. I had no idea what it was, and I thought maybe flying saucer. After some closer investigation on her part (she volunteered to PA-jump down to look) we came to the conclusion it probably WAS a silo door. And sure enough, not days later I've seen multiple confirmations. I think it's a great game detail! And you got a great shot.
---
Never said I was going after the queen guys. Besides it wouldn’t be my first nuke run
---
Our vendor, who spawns at random, Grahm be they name
---
Ahh, never actually read that
---
I found a level 45 two shot SMG on a vendor. It replaced the level 25 two shot SMG I'd also found on a vendor. 
---
I'm certain that's correct with the eggs, but with these recipes I've found that are bugged each ingredient works in other recipes so in those cases it must be the recipe.
---
Because we don't have enough server problems. In due time maybe 
---
Ah, they must have fixed it then
---
My only experience with it was with someone who's mic probably wasn't plugged in right, so all I heard was a consistent long, loud beeping noise. 
---
[This person](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ac7ccw/twoshot_gun_missing_at_95_try_increasing_hip_fire/) did some testing and reckons that modding for hip fire accuracy might help.
---
No they're not. They're playing a shooter with rpg "elements".
---
Thats not the same paint job. Camo paint isnt the military paint, which is just solid green.
---
Maybe if large and small shields.
---
Large  like riot gear. Melee only.  
---
Small like caps shield, small enough where you can lower it to steady aim.
---
I'll give it a shot
---
You had me at surface to air missile
---
The more you charge the more the accuracy goes down. I know if it says 95 it should hit, but it doesn't. Bug or feature? Who knows.  Just telling you exactly why you're missing. 
---
Sometimes I luckily make 2.
---
Oh no 😱 yeah I have heard about that happening. Push to talk seems to have helped a lot
---
but I think some setups are bugged. For example my turtle Beach headset (very low range for them honestly, I'm a cheapskate 🤑) has a mute switch which is supposed to mute my mic but it doesn't work. 
---
I play with a controller like a weirdo (mainly because with my broken foot sitting up or at a desk is painful) and I'm not sure which button push to talk is or I would try it. 
---
I think I'll try just pulling out the mic cord next time if I need to eat chips or something 😅
---
I've found about 6-9 two shots. Most have been okay. I think the first one I got from some amusement park I still haven't fully explored in Ash Heap. I warped in there by joining a horde event and as you know the event is often somewhere far away from the location displyed. I can't remember what level I was, probably 40-60, and the first two shot was level 35 handmade. It was so OP I didn't even much use it at first and I tried to sell it off because I thought I don't need so high damage high DPS weapon.
---
Sold few like auto granade launcher(or two?). Also brought few like max level plasma pistol and 10mm sub.
---
But I've found only one explosive gun, instigating western revolver. Which is really great, it's by far my best gun and the damage is pretty high. Explosive is such broken effect. I think my level 35 two shot handmade has slightly more DPS but mostly I use the revolver since the instigating allows one and two shotting most enemies with sneak 2x bonus. Againts landed SB I do often take the handmade or some other high rate of gun.
---
Considering the drops I've got TSE are rather rare. Still, given large number of players, there always someone getting a TSE naturally every day. But I'm sure majority of them are duped, because duping was and still is pretty easy. I've looked some old videos like about the artillery box duping and thought wow, so it was THAT trivial to dupe anything you wanted.
---
I think I'm something like level 130 or so. For most of the time I've not tried to farm XP and I've not so much tried to grind legendaries either. Did it some few weeks ago, then got tired and wanted to continue exploring the map. Just exploring, crafting, unlocking and slowly trying to do main quests.
---
Duping sucks a bit certain aspects of the game but as long as the players having all duped gear don't constantly try to attack me, it
---
s not the end of the world.
---
Ha ha ha awesome... the dude was definitely trying to give you something lol
---
they should disable legendaries in workshops since they're essentially arenas.
---
make pvp and pvers happy.
---
It’s possible that your character studied engineering in the vault 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Hey much appreciated. I ended up grabbing the plan and upgrading it anyway it gave me something to do :)
---
That's actually stupid cuz that never seemed to be the case in fo4. Sad day.
---
Yeah, from doing Patrol Duty recently (I was bugged for weeks, it would never spawn for me) I got Plasma Pistol, .44, .44, 10mm submachine gun and finally Handmade. I haven't done it since I got Handmade plans though, as I also got Lever Action from Grafton vendor just after that, so I'm on the hunt for screws for crafting to get the mods now =D
---
It’s called pacifist, go to menu, settings, game settings, and turn it on
---
Yes! This is a great solution 
---
This is actually the best solution to duping.
---
Just do a permanent clean inventory wipe of everybody who tries duping again. I doubt this is a feature they implemented, but we can dream
---
The other day I finally got a two shot 10mm pistol on my gunslinger build. Only one problem, it was level 15 :(
---
There should be a way to level up legendaries. Even if it required a ton of stable flux. Just something to make grinding low level events worth it and soften the RNG
---
I have the same issue, I run support/medic build and was planning on using my 3 star Cryolator for crowd control, but it breaks after you run about 5 clips trough it, had the same issue with all other energy weapons I have used, they brake way to fast to be viable 
---
There are different level variants, but the one at Charleston is always level 10
---
I know. I saved up quite a bit of caps to buy a two shot gauss because its my favorite weapon. I also run a build that was based on vats and crits. It was a sad day when I decided to permanently stash my gauss rifle. 
---
Ooh, ouch. Yeah the only issue I've run into is my cat trying to eat the little ball on the end of my mic 😅 probably sounded really weird!!
---
I'm the same, just started today :(
---
Whitespring is part of the savage divide, one of the "hard spots", the actual lvl of the mobs depends on the lvl of the highest player in the area. Within relative short range is a scorchbeast (lvl50-80) spawn and a guaranteed behemoth (50-80) spawn and nearby is also a deathclaw spawn (up to lvl 91) But luckily ghouls(the most common mobs there) are the squishiest enemy type. 
---
People use bulking to save weight? Why? It's for selling..,
---
Well it's still my best weapon but yeah what do you run for a rifle build right now ?
---
Yeah, this is one of those really, really dumb things.  If you play solo, you’ll usually outlevel your ability to buy them by the time you get there.
---
Looking at how the leveled lists are used by vendors/quests etc, they could be a pretty rare drop I think. They get thrown into a general "grab bag" for each area, and some quests use them from a "all areas grab bag" list.
---
I bought a two shot lever action instead. It fun and can easily kill anything that's not a scorched queen
---
Sentinal is better regaurdless of class. But thats just my opinion. 
---
I can’t find enough mats. Which one are in your recipe?
---
Jesus Christmas, I think the server probably sounded like an airplane turbine spooling up, I feel bad for the guys who have to work on site for whoever Bethesda pays for servers, fucking thing is probably a goddamn basketcase of an oven.
---
I haven't even seen a normal one of those LMAO . I'll look out for it. 
---
Theres the "oil lamp post" (streetlight) which is part of "plan: assorted lights"
---
Damn it. I’m a solo player who likes roaming and taking things slow. Really wanted to get ahold of the plans as I got my first handmade last week and really enjoyed how it fired. 
---
I think so far I've seen one cave where water breathing was useful and beyond that yea I don't see much point to it... Maybe they have some planned content that will make more use of it... Like a mirelurk king boss dungeon or something lol.. 
---
Right now there's gear, food, perks and I think a magazine that give water breathing... Just seems excessive compared to the measly few bits of underwater area. 
---
&gt;Is this confirmed?
---
Yes, I use them to share/gift things to teammates because it's faster than the stupid trade window. 
---
Could you take a picture and map marker?
---
That makes sense.
---
He didn’t get much, just springs, steel, and odds and ends.  Even the red crimson flux I could live without.  What aggravated me most was the time invested.  I was just trying to fix my power armor leg so I could fast travel to my camp.  Ironically, if I had spent that time instead just walking back (I camp far away from just about everything) it would have evened out.
---
You need to find it as a world spawn. It shares the same spots with t45 and t60. The mods are rather rarely sold by merchants (harpers ferry and both watoga merchants)
---
Yeah, while there are modifications for bleeding or energy damage on your power armour, they just don't compare to the legendary stats that can drop.  If I could get a "bloodied" or vampire equivalent on my fists I'd be happy lol
---
Nice.
---
Same thing happened to me. If it popped up but is not in your mutations list it is glitched. Sadly the way to fix it is to remove mutations until you see "recovered from marsupial"  at this point you can get it again and it should work. 
---
The problem was dieing as you got the mutation
---
Don’t go here if you have plaguewalker unless you want to feel like a monster. :c
---
95% meaning there's a 5% chance of failing.
---
Or end it with, “Check out my new vid on where to farm the 5 best legendary weapons in Fallout 76 later today!”
---
Something wrong with the other thread? Or does your phone notify you when I respond to other people too?
---
They aren’t super rare drops after 35, so you can scrap them to unlock the mods.  Get the lever action to make up for it and you’ll throw away your hunting rifle for good.
---
Dailies are grouped into regions. When you enter a region, you get a random daily from that region. The quest depens on server. 
---
Agreed 100%, but: don't bulk steel unless you plan to sell it to the vendor bots (and even then, it's a very bad waste of plastic, so just don't).
---
If only we could find out if most dupers are American, and then report every last one of them to the IRS for not properly filing these profits. At least that might straighten some of them out.
---
I was going to Whitespring at level 40 often.  Go there, ping some enemies, draw them back into the Security, Robot cordon.  No need to do it alone.  Alone, yes, it's hard.  Using this method, it's easy farming.
---
You can use the resort's own defenses as a team.  It's a great way to find strong weaponry for minimal effort, especially if there's already some high levels there.
---
One at a time only.  The rest will just fall out and be unrecoverable.
---
No the difference between the 2 is that if business software gets a bad update and doesn't work it effects every business that uses it. That's a lot of lost money. If you can't play the game you bought they you're out just the money spent. Nothing more. And I think you're taking all this as me defending Bethesda.  I'm not. All I'm saying is that we haven't had updates because they shutdown for the holidays.  They have said updates are planned for this month. If we go this month and next with nothing then I'd say the abandoned it. This game came out well before it should have and coming out not long before the holidays didn't help. With the issues the game has should they have forced everyone to work maybe.  If I was in charge I think I would have had everyone who worked on the game working other than Christmas Eve, Christmas day, maybe the day after, new years eve and new years day. But I'm not running things. 
---
What has this post become?
---
Sentinel but you need to stand dead still and each hit you receive reduces your AP.. may not show but it does and when you reach zero AP you toast 
---
grab the halucigen gas canisters in Poseidon power plant (5 acid each) then go kill the Grafton monster and snallygasters in Charleston
---
Theres also one that spawns right next to the hemlock holes workshop
---
Oh wow, how did I not know about this one.
---
I found a cool little trailer at the top of a cliff that I could build around, but the fast travel point put you down at the bottom of the cliff so you can't get back up. Aside from that, I've yet to find a cool spot to set camp.
---
You pussed out, let me have the last word. Don't be a bitch, keep it going.
---
It is the Advance Power Connectors plans. I found them at Harper Ferry 
---
I have a spare set I can sell you.  Just picked it up in Grafton myself.  I’ll let you start the bidding :)
---
Yeah, that's what it's for but people keep thinking it saves weight (because of bad rounding from Pack Rat) and then they recommend it to others who then recommend it to more people. Like just an hour before this post someone posted a chart showing that all bulks save weight until someone pointed out his values were wrong from pack rat. A lot of people were thanking him for the tip.
---
I've had arguments with people trying to tell them the right info but they insist "no it does save weight". Then oftentimes when people bring up stash is too small you get people saying "just bulk your stuff, that's what I do".
---
I know charts with correct info have been out since beta but occasionally people will go "no but a recent patch changed it" or something. So it doesn't hurt to remind people that it still works like this.
---
Welch train vendor might possibly have these also, but I have not 100% verified
---
Would love to get the lever action too, but not found any yet. And I’d prefer the plans to make my own then try to farm them from drops. XD
---
I wish you were on PC
---
Love it when someone start mowing everything down with a tse at nuked whitesprings, I just run in front of them, they die, I get free mats :)
---
I disagree with ll of this. The game is too fundamentally broken to give this kind of punishment. Even then, they have NOT violated the EULA so we should be more upset if they did any of these type of bans. Pull what GTA5 did and wipe the inventory but keep earned items and set scrap and caps to an amount based on playtime and completion only on accounts that have been flagged for cheating. 
---
Eh. I'm not so sure. They'll probably just rip them from fo4 again. Those ones suck. The waisted space on them is criminal.
---
I feel like a Cavalier Melee running at you with a Stealth boy used is alot more of a challenge, but idk, maybe its just me
---
You need to let folks know your platform and tag.
---
In real life I am a modern viking, I'm 6'7, long hair, big beard, so in games I love to sneak around, I feel like Kronk, everyone plays different, don't let other people berate or try to change your play style, games are about having fun and having people telling you how to play them isn't fun
---
Yet again: Grahm doesn't patrol anything. He is a random road encounter spawn. That workshop (and several others) has a road encounter spot nearby.
---
did you try the campfire trick?
---
Definitely think unarmed stealth build is very cool. For PvP 
---
Does that mean that love always changes?
---
Or they could at least fix the damn keypad pylon. As is it has an override switch that anyone can activate which completely defeats the point of a keypad.
---
I've enjoyed all of the fallout games, and 76 is awesome. Definitely worth 33 bucks. 
---
Apparently prices on them are ludicrous and I only have about 900 or so after all the fast travelling. So yeah, can’t see that happening. 
---
hook me up with some screws, dawg
---
...or put on pack-rat perk, thru-hiker, traveling pharmacy, put on excavators PA, drop anything heavy (do anything/all listed here) and fast travel out. 
---
Weight management is part of the game, and that’s not a bug.
---
You made a choice (server hop) that most of the time wouldn’t have any negative effects, but it still has the chance to backfire. It did, this one isn’t Bethesda’s fault. The bug itself is Bethesda’s fault. You knew about the bug and still made the choice, your fault. 
---
Wait is gatling laser shit again? Last time I tried it lived through double digit number of cores with 200% repair. 
---
There's a woman by the car with a tape next to her. I missed her the first time.
---
Offer will stand if you get a decent amount of caps
---
I bought FO4 just to mod on PC... so I have a system beyond capable to play it however I’m more apt to playing console games only because of the convenience of where I can play it over my desktop.  I’ve invested too much time already on the console so while I’d love to go into the debate of which is the best platform, I own em all... so it’s more a preference of where I’d rather play it at this point.
---
I put this perk on thinking it would just drop a grenade if you didn’t have any on you (sort of like the perk from CoD?), played a fair amount of time and completed some enclave events and totally forgot about the mod... I died and suddenly I seen the perk come to life for the first time. Turns out the Enclave Orbital strike grenades count for this and well, let’s say some friends were quite verbal about the outcome
---
Shit. And here I am out of ammo for all my guns... 
---
This is the reason there should be both a middle finger emote and a "Moon" emote.
---
I'd check my facts before calling someone a bitch.
---
Any thoughts on putting the 2nd and 3rd affects on the item card so we can see them easily while browsing? Currently you have to click through to the item to see multi-star legendary effects.
---
I love marsupial, but its kind of annoying in power armor, doing the super hero landing everytime you land 6" lower than where you started the jump. Strange in numbers makes marupial hilarious
---
It's very annoying and boring getting killed with 1 shot at level 80. 
---
Yeah, I've found more TSEs from vendors than the god damn ghouls.
---
I've never had a problem with voice chat.  In fact I suspect a lot of us have not had a real problem with it. 
---
I do have a gripe about people pretending they cannot hear you talk.  It happens a lot when you are trying to be nice to someone.
---
Tricentennial edition is pretty useless unless that's the only one that's on sale. You get a couple cool skins, for gear you'll ever use. If the plain copy is on sale too I'd go for that 
---
You bitched out, that's a fact
---
We all would, but it becomes less important late game when you are looking for legendaries.  The mods are more what matters.
---
Can someone help with the artillery piece? I can’t seem to find it. I know it can be bought in watchable from Phoenix bot but when I checked he didn’t have it. Is there a special perk or level requirement?
---
&gt;most powerful classes 
---
Explain? 
---
If you're lower levels, that is pretty rude. However if you're near or in the 100s, players become the only threats and we all gotta do something.
---
For 33 dollars US and it's the Tricentennial I'd say it's worth it. After playing the game I've thought at 30 to 40 USD for the normal edition it would be with it and add an extra maybe 10 to the Tricentennial. At full price I feel like it has too many issues, but others would say the feel they got their money worth. 
---
tfw you can literally play the whole game in third person and melee your way with VATS.
---
&gt;And I think you're taking all this as me defending Bethesda.
---
You are, by saying that they shouldn't be held to the same software service standards as other companies. What it boils down to is you are saying Bethesda don't need to care because games aren't as important as business.
---
That’s why I’d want the plan though. Then I can make/scrap on mass rather than having to try and farm them. Plus in the time while they’re level appropriate I can make better quality ones and get mod easier for it. 
---
Thanks! I personally don't mind it if there's a gunfight going on, but when all I hear is the Sonic Generator it bothers me lol
---
As someone who preordered the game and loved playing it since I’d say it’s worth that price seeing how it’s much cheaper than the standard game I preordered 
---
On xbox open the map, press LB, and go to challenges
---
Oof, imagine being so [wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ada9ak/has_bethesda_abandoned_updating_this_game/edfa4df/).
---
If you're gonna do a nuke zone at whitespring, pacifist mode is your friend.
---
Buy the game, be prepared for bugs, have fun anyway. It is better with friends so if you can buy 2 normal releases for 33$ give one to a buddy and you’ll have a much better time than playing solo. 
---
The generators at the CAMPs? Yeah the hums and putters of those get old, but not as annoying as the Sonic Generator
---
sentinel doesnt use AP are you confusing with dodgy?
---
Surprisingly I got one on my low level character from a low level enemy. Three star two shot explosive radium rifle. I had to transfer it to my higher level character tho because it was level 50. I don’t remember what I got it off of but I have never been able to trade on that bazaar. Either to sell or buy. I never have caps or anything of value. 
---
Plasma guns work. They just have stupidly slow, non-tethered projectiles which mean they are absolutely useless even in vats.  
---
so scout armor is best?
---
Yea I was just flat out of steel, so instead of telling me it decided to scrap mods.
---
Always looking for people to group up with,  I run support on PC.  -PeligadTheGnome
---
Or we can somehow use a Combat Knife while in Power Armor, but we can't use a Deathclaw Gauntlet or Mole Miner Gauntlet.
---
Bethesda is in charge, what can we do?
---
Two handed melee weapons are a great option against humanoids up to level 70 without perks only cause I have max strength and a very good legendary axe. But my gatling gun still performs better in the long run. 
---
How many? And when do you want them by? 
---
I’m trying to get a small business going haha
---
Yes, I paid 80 bucks for it. Wish I waited
---
Do some research on the topic and you will discover it has its own “AP” consumption.. does not show but it’s a thing 
---
 Its why we live. How could I let you do my job, when I must find the precious screws. How my little heart sings when I see a desk fan or .... maybe ... sometimes a Carlisle Typewriter can be found. ;)
---
 Combination wrenches have lead!
---
Uh huh. You showed me. Look at me, man, I'm blushing (i didn't click the link, I'm just guessing here)
---
Yep - was remembering the DPS stat from New Vegas as well - very useful
---
I'm on PC and this would be a lifesaver. Out of ammo for all my guns
---
That's the max, the amount per hour is if you clear it regularly.  
---
There’s nothing new, wait a few more weeks for when the Jan patch hits. There should be new stuff coming. 
---
Bethesda: "Our text descriptions that sometimes mean what they say, sometimes mean nothing, and sometimes mean the opposite of what they say are just fine."
---
If you do the brotherhood questline it's just sitting on a desk when you get to the end.
---
Go to Morgantown high school and gather all the plastic. Gather acid until you have 10 units. Bulk your acid. Scrap the bulked acid and you'll have 15 acid. Rinse and repeat until you have enough acid or you run out of plastic.
---
It just works!™
---
The damage stack from explosive perks plus weapon perks just blows everything else out of the water.
---
Not even melee armor pen is close. Things are not remotely balanced.
---
If you’re a min-maxer, everything in the TL;DR is important (and min-maxers don’t shy from reading for their research). 
---
If you’re not, just focus on what’s bold ;)
---
Be Thesda?
---
I've wondered about this, myself. Maybe give us the option to delete things once they aren't needed? Or just, yknow, delete it automagically when the quest ends.
---
Couple I listed in [here](http://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab9i2i/bugs_observed_issues_list_including_multiple/), the mutation perks can easily break, but are also easy to fix
---
My friend found a mini UFO at the bottom of a pond somewhere in the Ash Heap (I think near the Welch station) and it had a fusion core in it 
---
I’m only level 29. 
---
Been having the same issue a lot more recently and I play on fibre broadband, so it's nothing to do with my connection. I've been doing a lot more with workshops recently which makes it even more frustrating. Luckily I finished my huge camp today and I don't intend on shifting it anywhere so I can stop farming concrete now, but I use the defending quests to gain plans for furniture and the likes. Been incredibly frustrating recently. 
---
I need that stash increase onl thing in my stash is junk and 3 pa chassis
---
On PS4 press options button, then L1 for the menu,  scroll down to challenges.  
---
You get Atomic points for completing daily, weekly, and world challenges which are all listed.  The world list  a great way to see if you haven't discovered all the  places yet. 
---
a couple hundred, how many caps you want for em?
---
I use raider harness for per and agi, given my mutations and build need my agi/per. With class freak, I break even.
---
I run 1 per, 8 agi. With mutation nerfs and no harness, I can't even target in vats.
---
Flip side of the coin.
---
It's been awhile, and I've stopped picking up ammo I dont need on my main. But I've been leveling up an alt picking up a lot of stuff. Are you on now?
---
[how does this compare?](https://xboxclips.com/O918/e852f892-0357-46dd-8289-b46569dd65d1/embed)

Great spot
---
Imagine being so embarrassed that you can't even bring yourself to find out why.
---
Do two at a time, there is a slightly better reward for 2 per
---
what are you looking for to get that plan? 
---
Idk mass genocide ? 
---
Not that I’m a parent, but there’s something about working for and earning things that gets you more invested and attached to something. Being handed everything... doesn’t really make you invested in it. Just a thought...
---
Todd doesn't give a fuck about this game
---
My clan was play last nite and our leader was able to buy the Neon Signs at Phoenix at the Brotherhood of Steel vendor location slightly north of Watoga Station. She's level 65 if that matters.
---
i'm sure you picked up that this shit doesnt embarrass me 
---
Think it just furious having either a very low increase or having a very small cap. Cause give it something like 2% uncapped increase a minigun will be hitting trucks after 2 minutes of SBQ fight. Gatling gun would be hitting bricks after the first reload.
---
Gunsmith doesn’t work on Gatling Plasma? My man, you’ve just saved me 5 very valuable points. 
---
With the right ingredients you can just make them 
---
I wonder if it has to do with location and what servers you’re getting put on, since there’s no way to browse 
---
You fix it in the weapons bench, ohh.. wait.. :D
---
Lol what? 
---
My gamer tag is TomTheBard, I’ll see you in world
---
Mine is named NPC....
---
It's only against one specific target. And you lose your stack if you clip something else. Only useful against big single targets.
---
Yes! X2
---
I'm not a pacifist, but lately I come across players, and a bit later a random brown bag. I loot it only to have a TSE at my backside. Once that bounty flag pops up, I turn around, vats and 1 hit punch them. Easy 60-200 caps because they want to pvp over their lost junk. 
---
It's also "fun" to one-shot every PvE enemy in the game.
---
Updated. Thanks. 
---
Areas to nuke maybe lol
---
To get the plans, do the “Powering Up” events at power plants. That’s how I got all my generator plans (fusion included)
---
That’s good amount for lvl 9
---
Okay, I will give those a shot, thank you!
---
You suck.
---
Try doing some of the powering up quests, I got the generator one from there first time. Think it was powering up posideon 
---
Nope
---
Do the events at the power plant. If you have the worst luck it will take four runs. That is where the generator plans drops.
---
Someone mentioned that, I will give it a shot, thank you!
---
So a big boss fight like SBQ. Out of all the encounters, where stuff dies so fast anyway, you would think this is the encounter the modifier is worth it.
---
It goes away after you travel out of the cell and back. Had it happen a bunch.
---
3x jump height allows you to get to places you normally can't, like jumping on top of school busses to pick off melee-only monsters who can't teach you. 
---
Not to my knowledge
---
Power armor should be able to use Deathclaw / Mole Miner / Power fists!
---
Typical Chad
---
I coulda gone with a simple tl;dr
---
I think I bought them from watoga. Not sure it was long ago
---
I couldn't find any acid at the power plant. Am I missing something?
---
Yep, just like you don't give a fuck. Right?
---
By watching, you gave them a conduit to rejoin the dupe process, don't be all, I didn't inhale, with me.
---
Ahhh thats true. I always forget what levels some of these unlock at.
---
You get them from one of the Powering Up events at the nuclear plants, but it can be any of the generator plans. First time I powered up Monongah I got the windmill plans but the second time gave me the fusion generator.
---
I will give this a shot, thank you!
---
you know what?  I didn't think this was gonna change my mind, but it did.  now i feel like a jerk lol
---
I have a lvl 5 2 shot 44 pistol. If your on Xbox I can sell it to you for like 50 caps?
---
I’m not very well versed in game tech but how exactly would it stress the servers? Wouldn’t the items exist in the game already since otherwise they’d be in either the stash or inventory?
---
I would not sell it personally. You should find the calibrated shocks for it and use it as your pack mule armor.  That extra 200 carry weight is worth it.  Also double the materials when mining.  
---
Would be hilarious if Bethesda made all dupers have a sign above there head saying "I'm duping scum" and make them self destruct every time they put in any input to the game. wishful thinking I guess. 
---
graham
---
I have the same setup tbh! Didn’t even know there was push to talk? Game changer 😂
---
I saw this a couple times, for sure going to give it a try, thank you for your response!
---
Watoga Station FOR SURE
---
maybe it's a latency thing
---
What's the campfire trick?
---
In the previous Fallout games, it was called Police Hat.  Wonder why they changed it. 
---
Thanks for doing the leg work.  I have a number of the mods in red and think it sucks to waste all those caps.  Keeping them in hopes they are fixed and worthy in a future update.  I agree and already have Polymer on a couple pieces.  Haven't seen Lead Lined but will keep an eye out for it.  Kind of a toss up between lead lined and deep pocketed.  At lvl 79 now and playing in nuke zone more I'm leaning towards lead lined.
---
Thanks although I’m sure I tried that and it didn’t work. Has it been patched?
---
Yeah its an unexpected road they chosen ,, back when i was playing Fallout3 i dreamt a future Fallout would be a Map consisting of the Whole USA where you could be that trader that travels three states North through the barren canyon to sell your Sunset Saspirilla or the Brotherhood Knight who is part of a player Brotherhood going with other players out to fight a rising Radier faction made of other players,, or maybe just the simple life and set up a Farm and Tavern along a lonely road selling fine Moonshine.
---
I love 76 but i still crave that Grand Fallout MMO experience... ESO over the years has become a great MMO World full of things to do and explore, seems baffling to me as to why they didn't go a similar route (Map zones, invetory bags, CO-OP dungeons, World Bosses) with Fallout... Cyrodiill could have been the Capital Wasteland.. 
---
A fallout second life basically. 
---
Theres still hope.. maybe when they make a new game engine for a Fallout that big,,, ironic lol.
---
Sorry that was a big reply. 
---
What do you do when 20% of the people in your server are named “Melee” or “Sniper”
---
Immersion only works if everyone participates... but I’m still for it. It would be a good source for laughs now and then. 
---
Maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself then 
---
Can you make 50 caliber ultracite ammo?
---
Np.  I’ll be looking for you.
---
Can confirm, just some right across from Crevasse Dam.  With Green thumb, only two pods netted me 8.
---
Hazmat suit has a "hidden" perk that also mitigates part of the rads, which is why people with more rad resist outside of PA or a hazmat get irradiated so quickly. 
---
I’ll buy it
---
I lost track, what do I supposedly give a fuck about now?
---
There are three(?) different generators you can earn.  Learn them before you start again so you don't get the same one if going for them all.
---
Cool. I won’t be on till tomorrow at 3:15 pm EST
---
I said more immersive, not completely. Mics can improve or ruin immersion too. 
---
I was in the same spot, use that hunting rifle and mix in melee you’ll find taking enemies out will get easier. Also, whatever weapon of choice (rifle, pistol, shotgun) take the perks associated with it. That’ll help up the damage too.
---
I don't know, but you've spent a surprising amount of time replying on things you don't give a fuck about. And you couldn't even do that right.
---
More importantly we need clear info on legendary modifiers and perks
---
the hallucigen gas canisters in the workshop/locker room area down the bottom of the plant behind a locked door when scrapped each one gives 5 acid
---
snallygasters usually give 8 so if you know somewhere with a lot of them that's a good option 
---
If it makes you feel any better mine suddenly stopped doing it at some point over the past week. I wouldn't be able to identify what I did any differently though :/
---
Knowing this now, i think the fountain should give extreme diarrhea. And then heal you 10 seconds after. And now your clothes go from clean to dirty tan suit
---
Just let use unarmed in power amour. We could in fo3
---
Howdy niegborino
---
Yeah agreed. Youd think. But weapon balance in this game isnt well thought out and some weapons are clearly dominant. TSE damage is just   outrageous so why would you use anything else if you have it?
---
Just scrap the blueprint and start over, large buildings and footprints are tough to place. You’ll still get all the pieces and not have to use resources to rebuild.
---
Can confirm watoga sells them
---
I said I’m still for it! Thumbs up brah!
---
The rewards are unrelated to how many are turned in at once and after the quest is unlocked all Tech Data picked up will merge into one.  You can sell or stash a stack before they merge and retrieve them one at a time to turn in, if you plan ahead.
---
...so you're saying I give a fuck, but you don't know about what... damn, sick burn.
---
Ive see them most at harpers ferry vendor 
---
How much would you sell the plans for?
---
I bought my first gaming headset yesterday to try it out but I'm not hearing any voices, just normal game sounds.  Have it set to auto in settings.

I don't think. I know. You are dumb, ignorant and have social issues. So you can't be successful. You meet all the criteria of an online dweller who hate on other people who have more success in life. That's why you came to my post.
---
Repeat what? What you're trying to portray doesn't even make sense. You think everyone needs to have a decent job to make money? Shit... You have no clue what you're talking about and what is a business. Ever heard of capitalism? You live in one, dummy. Your replies "I make thousands", "300ft long boat"... Sound even more ridiculous at this point. Like of a typical kid bragging online. It's not like you even tried being original, you just replied with whatever... "But I have more".... *facepalm* 
---
Truth is simple. You came to my post, talked a lot of shit, no game, got put down quick. Now you're even saltier. You're just digging yourself a bigger hole but keep doing it. I find it somewhat entertaining while listening to you and the RMT auction site pings for sales going off. ;)
---
I could of written that. 
---
50% off, you pay $18.
---
Yes sir!  That would be a good idea.
---
Best idea yet though would be a salute emote, wouldn’t you agree?
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature.
---
Can't tell if people can't read previous replies or are just trolling.
---
Btw. Do the Powering Up events. ;)
---
Dunno, there might be some balancing eventually when we hit 5 stars. As for now the two shot and explosive are just to good, and will most likely stay that way forever, there is nothing really to compete with them.
---
it seems to happen to me sometimes on xbox, not sure what i do to have it happen.
---
Well I am no genius and my high tech energy would probably shot only once, and then blow up in my face.
---
Yeah, sure, that should do it if you know what's waiting for you. I ran in blind (because I like to be surprised, and I thought it was a low level quest...), and with my melee build I was a bit mismatched. Still made it, though, and I only had to restart the upload once, so, good experience after all, but it didn't make me like those Gutsys any better.
---
Plus Power Armour means Jetpacks and +100 Carry weight with the right mods :P
---
already did that. I still cant place even individual items. everything is floating at about head height or higher and cant place almost anything and also cant even build new either. I've relived and restarted the game completely 
---
Steady on there Thanos. 
---
if you place a campfire it allows you to place anything on top of it
---
No what I'm saying is that you can't compare software used for business and a game. If I ran a business this game isn't going to cause a potential loss after purchase.  If I ran a business and the business software I use having issues to the point it's not usable will cause a potential loss outside of the purchase.  One is more severe than the other. Should Bethesda released the game when they did, no. Should they have shutdown for the holidays, I'm not running the place but if i was they wouldn't have. Are the bugs and things you feel need to be fixed soon, probably not. You bough a game that has issues. The company shutdown for 2 weeks for the holidays.  In those 2 weeks not everything would have been fixed. Hell in the next few updates we could see more issues than we have now. Is it right, nope but that's how Bethesda works. If you have issues with that don't support them. Don't buy from the atomic shop and when the next game comes out don't buy it. 
---
Who says they are charm immune? My wife is a robot thank you very much and she has quite an evolving personality.
---
Maybe someone who is focused on leveling could help. I know that I have done a lot of exploring to mark locations on my map. This and the daily grind has helped me get to level 31. I daily grind food, water, get mothman eggs to make omelets (sell for more), build up my camp, and explore low level areas. Whitesprings was fun. Mount Blair area is good for fusion cores. Anyone else have any tips?
---
Quad shot explosive guns? Lol
---
There will definitely be better TSEs with 5* options.
---
Yup,,, a Moon emote with a Radioactive fart cloud :)
---
Fourthed. 
---
I told myself I would sleep on it and search after work. I ended up spending the weekend sick so I had plenty of time to sleep on it. Feeling better I decided I should try and at least finish the rest of the parts I had. The metal bar was wrapped up in the instructions!!! Let's get this pip boy ready to take on Appalachia!
---
Had a dude keep following me around and shooting me while I was just trying to do quests. I kept getting fed up and would just turn around and one shot kill him to get him to eff off but he would respawn and just keep doing it. Took a couple times of one shot killing him to get him to
---
Have you tried a stimpack incase your legs are broken? And you're sure it's not that you hit ctrl accidently?
---
lmao well the robots in Fallout can't even seem to figure out if I'm a ma'am or a sir, so I very much doubt they give a shit about how charming I am.
---
yeah, 5 stars will be able to compete with TSE we have now but 5 star TSE will be something else.
---
Ooh. That sounds like fun
---
The X-01 Tricentennial Skin looks nice. I use it.
---
Not clear, slightly yellow
---
they arent even worth holding imo
---
Thanks a lot, was wondering if my workbench placement clipped into each other and caused the problem
---
Yup me too
---
Can confirm got them from grahm 
---
I can get you some good stuff, me and my friends just farm all day. 
---
Ya I guess that one isn't bad. Forgot about it. Everyone I know personally ended up grabbing a different skin from the atom shop
---
They need some sort of new energy damage effect.
---
You seem to be chasing that last word pretty hard, guess you must care somewhat about that.
---
It wouldn't have made a difference, other friends were also in world, doing their own thing. 
---
I've found them just walking around normally.
---
Looks like your best best is to take over a workshop for one resource and your camp for another  
---
Fuck my face, why are we just learning about this?
---
level 15 alt - Cultist Blade plans and the plan for Harpoon Gun Flechettes
---
Lvl 100+. Still getting one shot.
---
It’s not like fallout 4 putting a new mod (like standard) on an item destroys the previous mod.
---
If only we had ten thousand posts in this sub to warn people and discuss this issue.
---
The lmg is in need of a serious buff but it's still fun as hell to wander off with one once in a blue Monday and go on a Rambo killing spree.

A bit like that scene in Hot Shots where the guy is waist deep in ammo casings :-)
---
Don't forget that despite a requirement for aluminum, glass, springs, copper, plastic, steel and gears you can never quite bring yourself to bring harm to the thousands of spring-loaded desk lamps throughout the wasteland.

You don't chat to them for their "soothing voice"? That takes high charisma you know
---
PvP isn’t fun at all.
---
So the Excavator does have mods.  The way they are label is annoying tho.  Since they do not have a 45,51,60 model number they dont even list what power armor it is for. So something like Tesla Coils on the Excavator just says "Tesla Coils" and not "Excavator Tesla Coils". One sure way to tell if a mod is for the Excavator is if the mod scraps to Black Titanium.   So far I am also looking for if there is a vendor that sells them regularly or not
---
&gt; If you have issues with that don't support them. Don't buy from the atomic shop and when the next game comes out don't buy it.
---
But that's a business case for providing live-service support. Because if you don't then you lose money.
---
&gt;If I ran a business this game isn't going to cause a potential loss after purchase.
---
Loss of sales because people won't buy your next game is literally that.
---
On the topic - the other areas at Whitesprings (the hotel ballrooms &amp; outside hotel rooms) do we get access to those some how? Or, will that be tied to the Presidential Quest?
---
You have a non explosive two shot shotgun?
---
Two shot isn’t really the problem.  A regular explosive shotgun with some other primary affix is just as effective.
---
That would make sense if I hadn't already had the last word and still kept it going
---
you dont happen to be on xbox do you? id love to see the mask in person and get a couple pics with you. iv been wanting to see them since i saw the list in the guide book
---
That’s what the italics in the TL;DR section talked about. We have established that 
---
* Hazmat shits have this hidden perk.
---
* power armor has this perk. 
---
* stacked chem-based RR **does not** offer this perk. 
---
* what I haven’t seen conclusively answered (correct me if I’m wrong) is whether 400RR from unpowered armor as per OP and any additional clothing items does or doesn’t give it to you. 
---
Lol one I shot a sB w my plasma rifle and vats, the plasma bolt curved to hit it so idk whatcha mean
---
And judging by the shooting range robot they all know civilization was destroyed by the nukes "my sensors aren't broken, I just can't deviate from my programming" So the people in this world never programmed in contingencies for most of their robots in the highly-likely event of a nuclear war. So these robots have enough self actualization to be charmed and change prices and accept bottlecaps as legal tender but they can't break out of mundane routines in emergency situations.
---
I’ll take that as a no then...sad Irish
---
I cannot at this time 
---
I got it from Charleston Landfill defense if I remember correctly. I have claimed and defended it many times and I didn't get it until recently, so maybe random, and unreliable way to get it. But that is where I got it.
---
I'm level 12 and the main weapon I use is a .44 revolver. It only deals 50 damage but can 1 or 2 shot most enemies I face.
---
To be fair the ghouls probably were registered not long ago.
---
Except you didn't.
---
yikes one string of cans is more than that
---
If only we didn’t need to be warned
---
2 shot only adds one particle iirc
---
No, as soon as you pick it up you can plant it at your camp.
---
Been there, feel that pain, and I'm that idiot that actually spends 30 - 60 minutes making them fortresses..
---
Either that or automod axed your comment. Same result either way.
---
First time he kicked my ass fair and square I was SO proud!
---
Favour lead for you CAMP position. If you just tag steel in components you'll find that you end up picking up virtually everything, steel is everywhere, it's much quicker to just collect shit and scrap it.
---
So it doesn’t double the damage on a shot gun?
---
Its simple you just go on a server find a duper or someonr who has bought dupped items and end their dupping ways

See you in the wasteland
---
I wonder if there's enough charisma in the world to charm the DMV robots. "Have a *nice* day."
---
Had a little haul of bright lamps and calibrated shocks for friends but i had to go build shit and not pay attention
---
A sentinent being with higher thinking wouldn’t subject itself to intense injury and Pain willingly.
---
Ghouls have lost that higher thinking and the ability to feel pain (no signs of that intense injury afterwards though so *shrug*).
---
I just assume wendigos slide between them and that the deathclaw that somehow got into the third floor behind me once went through the same process I did, getting a military ID and negotiating through the DMV
---
I've died way more since getting an explosive shotgun from clipping a bit of terrain and gibbing myself. Or brushing the trackpad on my laptop and unloading into the ground while trying to loot.
---
They are a serious liability if you're not fighting in an open field.
---
Confirmed was able to get them from grafting vendors 
---
I would check again if I were you.
---
Another location is the whitespring golf club downstairs on the wheelchair there is always a black cowboy hat on the handle of it
---
At the moment only the Prototype Hazmat, Damaged and Regular hazmat plus power armor.
---
It's one of the many things people are clamoring for, an Underarmor that acts like a hazmat suit
---
Semi cancel the super hero landing by hitting jump again as you land.
---
The golf course tapes and terminals reveal robots accept bottlecaps because of a Nuka Cola "promotion." I'm not sure it had anything to do with the apocalypse. 
---
 Doesn't it list what is going to be used prior to repairing or crafting something? I could have sworn it does that. 
---
I'd be more interested in the fucking Snaptails on the golf course actually giving violet flux because that's the only place people nuke. 
---
it's fine, i believe ya
---
It's a bug. It happens when you use stations after editing your camp. Relog from main menu fixes it. Or you can wait for the UI to come up but it will take a while. 
---
Yeah. But the Whitespring isn't low level friendly lol
---
victim blaming means anything to you?
---
I lost my junk because Bethesda can't code properly. I shouldn't have to be 5 steps ahead and anticipate everything that could go wrong. I should be able to just play the game and not be afraid of some game-breaking bug.
---
This is really helpful. I have an unarmed fighter character I’d really like to make an old college try with in a nuke zone.
---
Yeah, I know theres a few ways to cancel it, still a nuisance
---
Random question, but is there a way (in general, and not in this game), or is it feasible to have servers for payers under lvl 50 in addition to the types we have now? So lower than lvl 50 can choose which one they want to join? 
---
You can make fusion cores and if you have the plan for it, a decontamination shower.
---
I didn’t know if this, thank you. 
---
And steel for me if you want to get rid of it!
---
They would have to divide us by level... which might help separate dupers with their shitty level 17 miles with 100,000 bobbleheads
---
Bethesda, ban this filthy no good duper!
---
On Xbox, if you click the game icon, go to ‘Official Club’. Once there, switch over to ‘Looking For Group’. 
---
That’s where a lot of people post and a lot are about nukes, trading, etc. 
---
I don’t think so because I read the prompts
---
Awesome.
---
Well at some point deathclaws WERE intelligent. 
---
Graham occaisionally sells it for about 250 caps
---
I guess that could impact nondupers that use mules as well, eh?
---
You sound monotone, and basically dead inside, like me. Try to sound more enthusiastic, or don't. I don't really care.
---
Wait Junk Jet is a thing? I have multiple level 100's and have yet to see one...
---
I just got it last night. Got it from a treasure map. 
---
Addendum: instead of selling one should I scrap one and see if I get a useful mod?
---
Lol!
---
Sorry mate, I’m chaotic neutral.
---
I have tried so hard to pick up those lamps I tell ya. 
---
Add it to the list of non scrappable radios, TV's, cashier's, computers, and so on...
---
And since I'm complaining now anyway, I can punch a hole in a deathclaw but I can't enter a house because of some wooden boards in the doorway?
---
It's best not to think to much about logic in game :-)
---
If you have your camp nearby, you might be preventing him from ever spawning there for you, just like with camps preventing the Charleston vendor bot from appearing.
---
Popular opinion here pvp isn’t fun.
---
Are you using a charging Tesla?
---
Do the photos come back to the gallery ever? I restarted my game and console a few times. Just taking new pictures now. :/
---
Found the Gourmand 
---
I’ll try that 
---
I just want unarmed in power armor. Power fist, deathclaw guantlet, fuck all that, just give me a damn piece of metal I can hold in my hand like a bar of steel and I'll go to work with that. 
---
Well thanks for taking your time to read this, not many people willing to do that.
---
Clearly this one was...but he tried to sell me Amway so I had to kill him, just like in real life :(
---
I have a two shot black powder pistol I’m willing to trade. since you lost your two shot black powder rifle, do you want it?
---
SUBSCRIBE 
---
I’ll keep an eye out for this one. Where did you get it? 
---
&gt;!Order of mysteries - Pulowski Preservation shelter that links you to headquaters?!&lt; 
---
I have been saving up a ton of my treasure maps so I’ll try doing all of them and see what I get 
---
I loaded in to a new server after I posted and when it loaded in I had a second power armor frame with no pieces and my original frame with pieces in my inventory lol
---
 Or is there something we don't know? I'm picturing a weaponized pip-boy firing mega-man style. 
---
Where do you get the barrel?
---
Do you know if graham has a rout cause I’ve only seen him three times that last time was three weeks ago
---
