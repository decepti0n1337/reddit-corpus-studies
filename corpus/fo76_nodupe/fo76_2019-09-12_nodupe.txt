Per *extra* roll. These scrips would be outside the 150 daily limit, which is invaluable
---
i would but i‚Äôm lvl 50 and don‚Äôt really have anything i could trade
---
I would love it if the rads from water were also prevented with this legendary effect, just like with Aquaboy/girl. But they would need to fix it preventing Toxic Goo from irradiating yourself from consumption first.
---
Demo expert doesn't work with explosive perk though?
---
You‚Äôre both right, I‚Äôm hitting all my limits. Caps, scrip, stash weight, etc. So, it‚Äôs not my situation, but it could be someone else‚Äôs situation and that‚Äôs a very good strategy you‚Äôve suggested.
---
sneak damage is 2x. i recommend sneak whenever possible.
---
Motor oil might help more
---
Put down the controller and go outside.
---
I am outside?
---
I have three characters which would be around level 550 if combined. My experience so far has been that most everyday plans only sell if I position my camp somewhere that gets a lot of traffic from lower level players. 
---

---
They'll sell most reliably if your camp is in the forest and especially if you are near the wayward or any other early game quest. I like building camps around in-game content like monorail cars, caves, cabins, etc... but when I've done that in the ash heap, the mire, the cranberry bog, etc. I primarily get visited by higher level players. Higher level players typically don't even buy plans to mule to an alt because most of them aren't very difficult to find. 
---
On my junkie character I enjoy having a roleplaying / themed camp that isn't as convenient to low levels and I don't want to move. So on that character I just collect a bunch of plans in my stash. Every so often a low level will join my public team and when I check out their camp I can tell that they are new to the game. I travel to them and gift a bunch of plans at once. 
---
Even on my characters where plans do sell, most everyday plans don't sell for very much. I suspect that's partly because of duping. I sell most of my plans for 9 caps. I primarily list them as a way to notify myself when a low level is visiting my camp so that I can show up and gift them low level legendary weapons. Nearly anything else is a more reliable source of income, esp ammo.
---
Damage nerfs always = do more of everything, they went the laziest approach too.
---
I would love it if they could add siren head. At least for some temporary event or halloween.
---
Trade up.  Start with 5000 caps, trade for 6000.  Trade 6000 for 7000.  Obviously not with caps, but I'm happy to "trade down" to something if I really want it.
---
I want it just for fun. GIMME MY MARINE CHEST WITH Aqua
---
I've got fusion  cores my dude if ya need them Xbox is L0stmytaco.
---
It's a debuff, but it's the same for all perks/weapons/food buffs etc, so it's more of a rescaling. It makes builds that rely heavily on many attributes (like Bloodied depending on weapon prefix, mutation, chem, many different perks etc) which makes it slightly more affected than other builds, which could make it seem like a nerf. But no one that complains have tested their build in PTS, it's basically as OP as ever, even with enemies scaling up from lvl 63-75 to 100
---
*Confused screaming*
---
Thank you for understanding my intention.
---
Excavator is by and large the best overall. You are talking 3-5 damage difference per hit. If running a bloodied EP build then there is no difference since you should have dodgy on also. In radiation the difference is literally 1 second short to lose 10 health from rads (20 vs 19 seconds)  
---
Aside from PA skins depending that would be the only reason to ever have a different PA.
---
It does
---
Guessing you missed the part of the conversation that said I don't pvp and actually avoid it. So, your comment makes absolutely no sense, dude. Might wanna read the full conversation before commenting out of context and lookin like a fool.
---
Also gonna guess you missed the part that says I understand what that part of the game entails, unlike you obviously? 
---
It's a pvp zone. Deal with it or don't take workshops. Those are your only options, lol. Complaining just shows you don't understand certain mechanics of the game.
---
I guess I was thinking of gauss guns.  I'll be switching it in then.
---
Not gonna lie, the fact that they‚Äôre planning on reducing everybody‚Äôs damage output, making enemies higher levels &amp; adding THIS FUCKING THING kinda turns me off the game
---
Still trying to find a decent legendary 10mm myself.
---
Got more bullets for it than I know what to do with. Not putting em in the ammo converter.
---
Stream it lol I‚Äôll watch that!
---
Well then take a nap... And then fire the missiles!
---
Is the pie drop rate similar to the one in fallout 4? I have one, and it‚Äôs baffling to me that something that‚Äôs previously been so incredibly rare to get just fills 15% of your food bar and gives 20HP. Magazines seem more waaay common and they‚Äôre  more useful. I was hoping for a hunger rate boost or something
---
Prolly in sli tbh.
---
Solos, Duos, or in 4-player make it so you can only invite ONE friend to your team and then you get 2 randoms. Make each match more balanced this way.  
---
  
---
When it's slow, start the maps with fewer players. Make the map radius smaller to match the player count. This will drastically help with slow match queue times. It will also increase action and reduce minutes just running around.  
---
Remove the briefcase spawns at Arktos Pharma.  
---
Fix the countless other things wrong.  
---
Make everyone not be able to move until every person is loaded in.  
---
New maps.
---
So keep the 3 points in sneak. Whats your opinion on maxing out the commando perks/damage perks?
---
Mine is the second one removed and first one pulledüòû
---
It's still extremely useful.
---
You just have to actually think of when you need or want to use it now with the easy team bonuses.

T65 looks great
---
It's nice in the dark
---
The big bulk door that says nuke silo or something above it btw
---
All helmet mods for t65 come free
---
In my case A is prime
---
I would say yes. My Junkies double barrel does 395 damage. It also has plus 33% vats hit chance which has the same damage affect as the armor one I told you about. The gun two shots super mutant behemoths
---
I purposely havent optimized my perks for max magic damage so i take like a twentieth of his health per shot and usually instakill the wendigos, so its a balanced experience for myself and everyone else, and occasionally the wendigos refund my ammo so no loss.
---
No, I have 12 decent legacies and I think I myself am affected much less than others. The most suffering ones are relatively new players leveling 30 \~ 100 who are struggling to obtain better equipment and in-game currencies. They may easily get disppointed or frustrated by harder difficulties and by comparision with ones holding vested interest.
---
You have to go into the computer terminal there and open it
---
I managed a few good rolls and an interesting one that I wonder if will be great next week. Managed a AAFSS1S tenderizer, mostly sad on all my ranged rolls though.
---
Yeah, not sure how it would work. My initial thought is that I liked it, reminds me of other battlepasses where you can grind it for free, but pay for the premium version. But in those cases I don't think you can also pay to unlock the ranks, which sounds a bit excessive
---
I did, the door opens into a large hallway with another big bulk door. But the second door was locked close
---
Stairwell into the floor?
---
i imagine some scientist planted a couple as an experiment and now they just chill out there till they bloom. You can typically find them at some college campuses and museums that have a green house
---
I like the tent skins and the hockey mask set. But yeah
---
Ok, I‚Äôm gonna stream it on twitch at Nuked_Flora52, I‚Äôm starting in about 10 minutes
---
Once you pop the cores in you have to use the terminal on that console to open the blast doors. Once is open go through, turn left, and follow the path up the steps to the launch chamber. There aren't any other locked doors past that point.
---
That makes me remember one time that i triggered fast travel bug in q molerat horde event and I appeared in a mine underwater,I remember the mobs floating but fast traveedl to home fast.
---
Do the drops disappear?  What‚Äôs the advantage?  Just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing the best thing
---
You mean roll the cards back to what they used to be? Lol used to be 100% damage on explosives. Hell 3x damage on a tse. God i miss that. The did need to tweak those things but the nerfed the legendaries AND the cards that boosted it. They said they made adjusting more manageable by doing it yet the only thing they adjusted was 2% on one weapon and i think 15% on the alien blaster. Both of those adjustments mean NOTHING. Maybe a cut in damage would be ok but bloodied got the shaft. Yes it will still be the best damage output after the nerf but 1 shoting general mobs is part of how you kept yourself from dying.  Its just going to be something we are going to have to deal with because they don't care and obviously are not going to fix.
---
Bored of keeping stock and having it take up space in my stash. I recently put 1 vendor back up for each camp and only put ammo and serums in them - I like having a bigger icon on the map for me to find, and also cause I like showing off my camps since they get a lot of compliments üòÇ I get my caps from nuclear winter so moving inventory isn‚Äôt a priority since I‚Äôm rarely in adventure anyway. If I‚Äôm near max caps, I‚Äôll cut the cord on my vendors
---
Please don't make assumptions about me. I've played since beta and my most memorable moment was when there was a big free for all brawl going down at the ammo factory. Just a bunch of people screwing around. Not some nuka spamming pissing match, you find in most "Organized PVP".
---
 I don't take dying in a video game seriously if I lose a few caps oh well. Mind you I don't go claiming PVP areas when I'm carrying scrap I don't wanna lose. Likewise I don't farm players for scrap either. 
---
Most of my friends have moved on from this game and for good reason. You eventually run out of stuff to grind for and the PVE encounters become a predictable repetitive slog.
---
I'm a casual PVPer. Had a blast having a shovel fight the other day with another player. I lost but laughed my ass off. Can't get that kinda quality entertainment  playing COD with the try hards.
---
I tried that in New Vegas and it was not a good time tell ya h‚Äôwhat
---
I got all 5 toons as different builds, it‚Äôs great!! Sneak commando today and PA heavy gunner, guns blazin tomorrow
---
No, for some reason it's the only armor type that doesn't have any paints.

Well good news if you send it to imgur you can provide a link thus proving it is happening to you. The biggy is have you QUIT fo76 then restarted it? I know if I let it lapse on a Tuesday sometimes either I can't get into the atom store or the banner sticks around until I do a force quit.
---
Yeah no. Still not worth it. You can usually pick up some nice stuff that you actually know exactly what is is from player vendors for 6k
---
As long as you are consistently scrapping and stashing, don‚Äôt get too worried about dying. Only thing you ‚Äòlose‚Äô is junk you are carrying but you can always go back to that spot and collect it (in a brown paper bag where you died).

Solution, don‚Äôt team up

Only time it happened to me was with a handmade that had 500 when I logged in. Just shoot it until it‚Äôs empty again
---
I‚Äôm sorry but Follow Me is reserved for ‚Äòthere is a legendary with me, come get some‚Äô.
---
Jesus fuckin christ
---
I dont have Imgur or what ever that is and as ive said ive shut the game down multiple times
---
That‚Äôs a good idea tbh. Troubleshooter armor sets will become the new UNY sets
---
Great idea, didn't think of that.
---
In an mmo, don't ever team up, brilliant solution!
---
Hope this helped.
---
Just has to overlap it, best to just overlap it a bit so people can get there easier / safely.
---
[removed]
---
If it collects junk/scrap then that is fine to use. Main thing is to get as many points into your main weapon stat as possible. if you go for a jack of all trades build you'll be the master of none.
---
I feel like i always have random bouts where the game decides its my time. like ill be taking normal damage and something randomly takes me down to 10 health in .5 second
---
That will work, ideally you want to just catch it on the end of the nuke so you can run easily out of the nuke zone, bonus points if you don‚Äôt hit the station (though atlas is actually kinda close)
---
Thanks mate, appreciate it
---
MSORPG
---
Yes a few people in my discord mentioned the same thing multiple people in the same server kept joining with this same perk
---
I don't know what gun you have, but I repair a fixer or handmade 1-3 times per real fight... Like 6x a day, not once every six days.
---
Your not alone.this is the only game I play.i legit love it but at times it's best to just turn it off.
---
Slugger, it's just a visual thing.
---
I can think of many times where giving a signal to your random teammates who are not on your private team for  random events would be incredibly useful.
---
Why would all team types have to be "Chill"?
---
More importantly why would it be un-chill for your team leader having the ability of giving you a clue of what he wants the team to do?
---
We can already emote at each other and see the emotes no matter where we are in the world. Giving your team leader the ability to entice you to do certain things by grabbing your attention with free teleports would make ALL teams more efficient at it's stated goal.
---
Isn't that the whole point of having different team types is to have different expectations? Casual,hunting, events,ops,etc.?
---
If he wanted to show it off he would have it on the wall labeled, not in a vendor, and it's 100% the sellers fault if he lost caps.
---
This is a god level bushwookie perk in nuclear winter
---
Strangler Heart. The tiny additional points on T-65 still aren't as good as the tiny acid damage effect after that nerf
---
Thanks, I was a little confused!
---
I roll with a set of Vanguard armors with Healing Factor mutation and Sun Kissed +2 perk. Unless  needing to tank a situation, I don't dip into my stims very often.
---
I also use Field Surgeon +2 and Born Survivor +1 when not using PA. I remove Born Survivor when I ooze into my X0-1.
---
Edit: a typo
---
I haven‚Äôt! But it looks right up my alley, I‚Äôll have to get on it.

If he was just showing off it should have been labeled on the wall...

There is so many bugs in this game I legitimately cried this morning just trying to get through a quest

They're just doing it to mess with people hey, unreal. Never understood why people go out of their way just to grief people for no apparent reason.
---
I've been living at a spot just north west of middle mountain cabins and north of Emmitt mountain disposal site, on the side of a cliff for a long time. Very peaceful. I have a stair case shooting out off the cliff so the house is floating but I don't care. Really close to white springs. I actually live in wv so, it feels like home to me.
---
I also feel the same. I don't want to change my build around for each daily ops I do, when I also have the perks cards to make me want to scrap my spare ones I don't use. I'm torn between keeping majority of my cards so I can switch builds, or just keeping what I have and being useless in daily ops. 
---
I also hate swapping my cards around because I forget to swap them back, so not having perk loadouts makes me less Inclined to change my build for each event
---
What kind of armor do you use?  I have it falling out my ears on several armor mules. I am on xbox and can kit you out.

Yesterday I got into this full lobby uranium fever with players from lvl 30 to 500 and every single one was a team player. Nobody one shot any of the legendaries, it was awesome, really nice group of people.

Either just miss Monongha Overlook so there's a nearby nuke-free fast travel point, or try to hit as much of the town of Monongha as possible so that people can go kill mole miners for flux materials.

Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself....upvote 100 times

Do you not run gunsmith 5? I mean I run bloodied explosive gatling plasma I can go through 12-13 cores before it needs to be repaired. Using my TSE gatling before that was maybe once a month fix. My minigun TSFFR I dick around with is still 90% , my TSFFR gauss is still around 80% white and I have been using that gun on and off for 3 months now it was the first item I bought with gold and it was my first roll.   
---
My gunslinger has never repaired a gun from level 50-108 swapping between a QE25 and a Q3325 pistol. I use makeshift warrior 5 and my unstoppable monster I got has never been repaired once it is around 50% right now.   
---
So...yeah I am thinking either those guns super suck, you don't run gunsmith, or you fabricated your tale to play a woe is me card.   
---
Oh and if I don't have gunsmith on and use my BE plasma that thing breaks before an overcharged core is drained.
---
Maybe 200 caps. They‚Äôre fairly easy to get. Perhaps up to 500 for the ones with chaps. 
---
But that‚Äôs really on the high end in my opinion.
---
Sorry for the dumb question, but does anyone know where the hell the fireplace is in the build menus?
---
Hey dude, I'm not on XBox but this subreddit in general is kind of a magic repository of great advice on the game. The folks here, through their care and knowledge, helped get me from a gormless Level 1 to almost LVL300 right now. Don't be afraid to come here and ask questions, we all want the wasteland to be full of excellent Vault Dwellers.
---
price dropped drastically when twats dooped the tickets. i've seen them for as little as 100 caps in vendors. usually around 500 caps. Sometimes 300 caps or more. Someone who doesn't know any better will pay a lot. I usually pick them up for cheap as i drop them for newbies.
---
I want to die with how many bugs there are right now, Bethesda what the hells is happening???? How many years this game been out now come on what the actual fuck man. It sucks because I love the game but the bugs make it sooo so so so so bad to play. You can go a while without one but when you do get one it‚Äôll likely fuck your entire game so that‚Äôs cool.
---
thank you so much
---
are you on now ?
---
No I run gunsmith 2\*
---
Everyone who runs fixers and handmades knows what I'm talking about. Especially explosive
---
Yeah actually
---
While I concede there are asshats out there, I was also guilty of this during Season 1. However, once I saw that one or more of my teammates was running bloodied, I switched it out.i think the longest I left it shared was 30 minutes. I flashed the I'm Sorry emote so they'd hopefully see it on-screen.
---
Scrip
---
I saw just lower the price, stop trying to find more items to give and just make it cost the appropriate amount.
---
Indeed I'm racist, but that doesn't have anything to do with what I posted. But if you want to go there, so be it.
---
Great shot man! When I find bugged mobs, I usually take a pic beside them like we are at Kings Island together, having a great together.

GT DanielRacy I have loads of shotguns. My weapon of choice in any game.
---
I did, then another person started doing it directly after. So had to block them also. It's just sad people are doing it "for fun".
---
Its really not worth hanging on to workshops
---
Sell them
---
Oh my bad. Just keep your eyes open. Whenever I was looking for a piece of clothing like the mask or the Blue ridge caravan stuff, I would just message every person I saw wearing one.
---
I always asked nicely if they would sell it to me and a good amount of the times they were willing to trade and bargain. That's how I got a scout mask before.
---
I usually just give my known plans away to low levels or drop them in low level populated areas I have a habit of when I notice them going over to them and giving them abunch of water radaway stimpavks and materials to help them get into the game easier !
---
First learning about workshops I had hoped for something along the lines of a mechanic that would allow players to group PvE or PvP easier. Something like workshops being legitimate pre-war infrastructure that factions or something could fight over, but with no incentive to band together to claim workshops *for the sake of the workshops*, it's all just a 'King of the Hill' PvP mechanic with **no restraint** on who can choose to challenge you for ownership.
---
Unless you regularly play with friends, there's no reason to try to hold on to a workshop that you've claimed for challenges, since the expectation is that someone is going to come along (possibly with friends) to void all of your effort in a moment. If ownership wasn't shifted over at the death of the singular player, and instead faction, objective, or team-based, it might even be a bit more fun to try to hold out against someone who's gonna be the Arizona Ranger to your Texas Red.
---
My troubleshooters explosive minigun would like to have a chat.
---
It doesn't.  I'm sorry someone stole your game dude.
---
Who gives a f√ó√∑+ what anyone else thinks. I've played since day one. No breaks. Lvl 522. I play everyday. The bugs here or there were never game breaking. Annoying? Yes. I powered thru it because I'm an adult and understand there is going to be issues in making a game like this. I've met great friends I'd of otherwise never known. I've been happy. I've been pissed. Thus is life. If you enjoy the game, play it. If you don't, move on. I think I will be here the last day doing the robot dance when they shut the servers off for good. I'm sure I will say "F'n Bethesda." and smh plenty more times till then. But I am sure the fun with my friends will far out weigh them.
---
Throw a silencer  on it grab 5 addictions just to try it out.a specked 10.mm is alot of fun
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 where they forgot to include tons of obvious information in the game. The only way you find stuff out like this is by following the rules weekly ITV, patch notes or just random reddit posts.
---
I don't mind the random teams and never have a problem with griefers. Usually just play with my discord friends.  but yes even if ya gotta block the whole damn server ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è some ppl will just never care and looking for something to do..
---
He is talking about the bad game design of punishing a players ability to play because of arbitrary times gates.
---
 I think the system should still reward you if you have extra, just less.
---
At what resolution? You're not rockin 60fps at 1080p with that? Try turning off depth of field and walking the distance sliders back a couple notches.
---
I just turned in 9 tickets and ended up with 4 Western/chaps outfits. I guess these used to be rare?  Idk seems like if you get a couple hundred caps you're doing good
---
What is the most sought after flux? I would love to start farming for it.
---
I sell regularly them without chaps for 375 and with chaps for 475.
---
Whats a good price For the 10mm? Have no idea what it goes for
---
Sweet... back to nukin ammo camps
---
It's cool, man. I guess both go hand in hand though. My views are indeed messed up and I'm paying for. "I'm messed up mentally."
---
Okay back to my point about the players that suck running no QoL perks. As I sit and type this I am now on 4k spent of .45 and my fixer is still 200%. 
---
Gunsmith 5.
---
Almost certainly, no biggie though, almost all legacy weapons sold are.
---
Eh.  I'm pretty sure you're a troll.
---
Honestly I never noticed when the nukes were down, until I saw JuiceHead's video on it
---
I accidentally took someone's rads off doing this. Me and, the wife run build party and a bloodied joined us while I forgotten that I was slowly removing rads cause fuck rad away
---
The weapon perk cards (regular, expert, master)were never multiplicative. They were alway additive. So Even right now the 3 weapon perk cards give 60% total bonus dmg.
---
I see how it's a fine perk for some, so I didn't sweat it I left and started a new public group, then the person left that one just to jump into mine. They did this a couple times before I finally had to block them. ü§¶ Then another person starts doing the same ugh.
---
I just use bloody for the stat boosts, INT for XP and STR for carry weight. I don't use any perks like adrenaline and even bust out a low level explosive 10mm pistol on events so I don't "one shot" stuff.
---
But that would mean Bethesda gives us something we ACTUALLY want.
---
They don‚Äôt do that.
---
What's the 3rd star
---
I like to use the lever action because I have a nice skin for it, so switching to a cause rifle is a no for me.
---
Just means I'll not be able to play the way I want to anymore, as I use my BE lever with a ling scope and one shot most things. Sounds like it's gonna be a 2 shot, not quite as fun to me.
---
Now what happens if you share Rad Sponge?
---
It's not that they have to be chill, they just are by the nature of everyone being randoms.
---
I've been on plenty of teams where the team leader is under level 30, even if it was an alt most people would just leave that team and start another if they were making suggestions because they're just after mutation or team bonuses.
---
If they got rid of one of the many defunct teams we have and introduced a "Teamwork" team where you get a larger experience bonus for completing goals in proximity of other team mates, then you'd get they type of people you want and all those features you suggested would be excellent for that.
---
Playing 76 is like working out... gotta push through the pain.
---
If Bethesda want to keep including "Claim Workshop" in the new season challenges, then they need to do something about allowing players (WHO ARE PLAYING IN PACIFIST MODE) to either surrender or un-claim workshops.  
---
The game has essentially \*"forced" players into playing or accepting being targeted for PvP non optional, by making Claiming Workshops part of the Season Challenges, in the same way that it  \*"forced" players into playing Nuclear Winter.  And yes I agree that "you don't have to claim workshops", I agree that "you were warned", I agree that "You don't have to play Nuclear Winter".  I also accept that for experienced plays there are ways of doing things that minimise the risk significantly, I even invented my own ways.   
---
But is it fair for players who don't want to PvP, to be \*"forced" to miss out on 4500 S.C.O.R.E. (that's 1 rank at least) a week.  1750 for dailies, 1750 for NW and 1000 for the Weekly challenge S.C.O.R.E. and 9000 for a double S.C.O.R.E week, and to also lose 1 of the opportunities for the Gold Star challenge each and every day because they don't want to PvP?  
---
I don't think it's fair, but i'm a pacifist, foodie build who plays the game for fun, so what do I know.  
---
\*"Forced" I use this term in a passive way, obviously no-one is physically making anyone do anything, but the game mechanics heavily lean towards having to do this or accepting that you probably wont finish the Season, I finished with 2 weeks to spare, but without completing the workshop challenges and the passive NW challenges, I would not have made it without having to use Atoms to do it.
---
Really? What's the dialogue option you need to do to do that ?
---
Same.  I know tons of plans already, but it's not uncommon for me to find something I haven't come across, so I always check the vendors.
---
Sometimes I might do a power plant, get the processor running and lock it, but that's it. There are 3 plants, so if someone tries to take one when there's 2 others up, they're just a-holes looking to fight but it's not worth the effort.

Casual teams be what you are looking for and every other team type has my idea.
---
If you join a events team, i don't want you jerking off not doing any events.
---
It sounds to me that you like casual teams.
---
So Cavalier's armor?
---
&gt; Reduces damage while blocking by 15%
---
Make sure you hit the whole mine icon on the map. Barely touching the edge like the Queen does not work.
---
There is nothing on the road map, but if bos are entering the fray enclave will be next, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we get at least one enclave npc soon
---
That sucks. If you bought it with Amazon screen shot where the driver dumped it and contest it. 
---
A game case could be easily put through a letterbox, left with a neighbour or hidden, it's not your fault if the driver was too rushed, lazy or stupid to put it somewhere safe.
---
I know in comparison to getting the gold from fallout new Vegas getting the gold this time just felt underwhelming.
---
I dunno lol. Whatever flux is needed for popular ultracite ammo probably.
---
I personally go after fluorescent cuz it makes shotgun shells and .308 ammo, since I plan on taking the shotgun/heavy gunner cards eventually on my unarmed character just to mix up playstyles every now and then. I wanna use a pump or double barrel shotgun and MG42/LMG.
---
Violet and Cobalt are needed for jetpacks, and Violet is needed for calibrated shocks (carryweight) for power armor so I imagine those are popular. Violet is crazy easy to get in the Bog, which gets nuked frequently. Also lots of crimson too IIRC. If the nuke area includes that pink pollen forest, that's a good place for fluorescent. But sadly the Bog has like 1 single cobalt plant, however the area around the Colossal Problem event has a decent amount of Cobalt (depending on if the nuke goes north or south), but mainly Yellowcake frickin everywhere. Also Whiteprings has some Cobalt, and that gets nuked sometimes.
---
Edit - whatever flux is needed for ultracite 2mm cartridges is probably popular too, for those gauss miniguns/shotguns/pistols/rifles.
---
Use it to delete 10mm. With the right mods it‚Äôll VATS forever.
---
My gf's dad is over 60, never played a game really before. And we got him into it, hes over level 150 now lol. Point is, he loves the game. Loved your post bro. Cheers üçª
---
FYSA: Had to spell stuff weird or it kept getting flagged
---
If it takes steak and whiskey for you, bro, so sad. So sad for your lift, bro. You need steroids like that? So sad for you. I'm an herbivore that lifts 440 on low end. You don't even know the extra lift that herbivore even offers.  Those that boost SPECIAL even higher get more carry weight, &amp; HP &amp;AP regen , not to mention XP percent multiplier. 
---
Get bent, carnivore cunts. The time of carnivores is over. You will continue to fall behind as time goes on. Welcome to the future, player base. Welcome to the new XP grind. Welcome to
---
It‚Äôs all crap anyway
---
I get that and didn't make a big deal just left and started another one. Just them going out of their way to keep joining any public I'd start was the kicker. Looks like it isn't an isolated event, kids doing it just to grief people.
---
FYI, kjow.rhis is late, but these are the JUNK category items.  
---
Found out the hard way just know when I tried to kill a Liberator with my shotgun, he dodged and via VATS I point blank blew myself up with a car, these CAN be lost.   
---
Thankfully after about 30 second after respawn my Vault bag showed up (was at Feed the People,  so it helps it was a bag no one can open easily).  
---
So um, yeah, fear of death is still there!  But thanks for letting me know there are good static locations to farm if I lose em!
---
Pretty sure a BE Lever will do the job just fine as long as you're fully spec'd. It'll still one-shot most things.
---
No worries, these are the junk items, I can lose them on death.  Accidentally tested just now.   Still afraid and excited!
---
Now scrip it.
---
Had the same problem. Put a mail locker on my porch with smart locks i can remotely lock and unlock from my phone when my cameras pick up the mailman.
---
"oh my god that level 400 is barely alive, he must really be struggling with this game, you need all my radaway and stims more than me!"
---
I agree. When there are challenges that say take 5-10 workshops, I do...but then you are bombarded by ‚Äúblah blah blah is attacking, prepare defenses‚Äù. I don‚Äôt care. I only took it for a challenge. Same with people who hang around in attempts to try and get you to come back. Even funnier when they get mad for ignoring them. Sorry Charlie. 
---
Having the option to give up the workshop would be great. I usually just leave not saying take me when there are challenges active for them
---
PS: all the people saying you agree to PvP blah blah blah are not paying attention to what the OP is saying. They and many of us other players take them for challenges, not to fight or build, etc. We don‚Äôt give a duck if you want to fight as we will never return to appease your fighting sense. You can sit there till the Brahmin come home for all we care. This is simply regarding challenges.
---
it was cut content for a PVP event where we rigged elections, killing other people who tried to compete with being president. cut because Bethesda realized that a large amount of the adventure mode community dislikes forced PVP
---
You talk to her and then talk about the logs and one of the options let‚Äôs you give them and she‚Äôll give you the scrip
---
Underrated reply.
---
Most games have some bugs. Few games are perfect. And, everyone likes what they like. I love this game even though its glitches drive me bonkers. I love it because even for its flaws, it still feels like Fallout when I play, and I love that world.
---
Ty for correction, I'll have a change.
---
There are lots that take them for challenges instead. Not because hey want the damn thing. I am happy to let them rot but find the whole defend take back blah blah blah annoying. You can angry emote, thumbs down, whatever...if we only took the workshop for a challenge we will never fight for it.
---
I have a quad exp 10mm pistol, I use it to destroy the modules during nuke silo runs. It's way more efficient than grenades or punching them doesnt waist ammo from my main gun, its also light in weight and 10mm ammo is cheap and easy to find.
---
Excavator is a walking beer can compared to the T-65.  The damage resistance is noticeably better in the T65.
---
Mods are easier to obtain and most people running strangler heart armor obtained the armor through exploits.  I like the T65 because it's unique armor that I got through grinding.
---
I am level 480 and I have killed literally hundreds of scorched beast queens.  Not once did calibrated shocks or emergency protocols or targeting HUD drop for me.
---
Anyone who tells you that the mods aren't near impossible to obtain doesn't know what they are talking about.
---
I know but it would be nice like my other reply to this post I can not not loot a legendary weapon :)  I think my weapons are all ready end game quality I just really miss crafting what i want.  I know I am being a little bitch but......:)
---
It's not here yet, its coming in the future if I remember correctly
---
My GT is auberrytoo, I always have a few extra stims, and don't mind running around doing quests if someone needs help, add me if you like.
---
I had a sever that didn't get a single public event for 3 hours today, I really should have left but I was busy camp building.
---
twas not confirmed on the PTS, so either they decided against it, was never gonna happen, or they are gonna test it later
---
I got mine after someone else nuked something other then Prime.
---
This is the real cause of her headaches.
---
This is fucking hilarious. Stash ya junk first.
---
Or just remove it entirely. I mean what‚Äôs the worse that‚Äôll happen I get to have fun?
---
I was mostly wondering if they were still going to incorporate it in somehow, could be fun
---
GT is the same as on here. I got an AA3390 fixer you can have and some ammo to go with it. I'm usually on after 7pm Pacific.
---
My gt is ThePeoplesXbox1 if you ever need anything just message me and I got a FE90 combat shotgun you can have too.
---
Are u on pc, I‚Äôll give u caps for a photo op ü•∫
---
Exactly!!
---
A lvl 4 walked up to me and wanted to trade and he put up a rad away for 0 caps I‚Äôm sure he was real new to the game since he was I‚Äôll say 7years old but that kid is probably one of the most nicest people I‚Äôve meet in the game
---
Omg, that was me many levels ago.  üòÜüòÜüòÜ
---
Reinforced legs, face, torso, and two miniguns.  
---
She's a lot of fun to fight as she actually feels like a threat.
---
5k caps maybe more
---
Well, inevitably you're going to move camp. Someone somewhere will be a dick and take screenshots of your camp and send reports to bethesda. So don't be surprised if you lose everything. You're willingly ok with breaking TOS. There are ways to get rid of the stupid thing. Moving camp is the solution. You're not going to lose out on anything when you move camp as everything is stored via blueprint. Plus its just a button click away from hitting "delete blueprint" I don't see your problem.
---
I went left but before the stairs the door was closed
---
To add to this point the higher your intelligence the better your chance at unlocking mods for weapons/armors when you scrap them. Having some berry mentats on you before you craft and scrap is good too since it gives you +5 to intelligence also every 1 point of intelligence gives you 2% experience bonus as well.
---
Getting scrapper early from intelligence is a godsend for repairing your armor and weapons. Also getting white knight is good(reduces armor break and makes it cheaper to repair), just need 3 agility, also getting ammo smith level 2 in agility is something you don't want to sleep on. 
---
Also make sure you get level 3 super duper in luck stat is a must have for crafters since it effects ALL crafts doubling the results aside from making gold bullion legendaries/bulking and smelting ore.
---
When you open your pip-boy, the bottom left corner has the command to place your C.A.M.P. Place it in a new area and then place it back to its original spot (assuming you don‚Äôt want to move). When you open the build menu, everything you had built will be saved and able to easily be placed. It should be one of the first sub headings in the build menu.
---
You on PC? i'll give you 5k caps for it
---
Thank you so much
---
To be honest that‚Äôs the actual price. (My opinion)
---
Add Southpaw AZ as well. My wife and I are gamers and would be glad to help you out. It can be rough gaming as a parents my guy
---
One of my favorite  spots. It takes a long time to explore all of it. One of the most unprecedented spots in the game, and I don't  mind
---
Same. I did it for the first time with some friends, and it took a long time. We were all lvl 70ish with no legendaries or anything, and man. Some of us went down, we had to constantly move around and use terrain, we had a blast. Took us so long but was fun!  
---
Next time I saw it up I immediately joined and was ready to have some fun. Thing died so fast I barely got to do anything lmao. Boring.
---
Do the Mistress of Mystery quest, if you haven‚Äôt done it. If you‚Äôve come across a dead girl in a black and green dress with a damaged holotape, that‚Äôs what starts the quest.
---
you the real mvp
---
I'm sure there is something hidden in some body of water in the game somewhere, there must be.
---
I've swum most of the swamps and quarries and lakes in the bog, mire and savage decide so far (some particularly pissy mirelurk queens encountered) no surprises yet.
---
Tomorrow I plan to swim the river from the ash heap to the forest .
---
Oh I totally get where your coming from, I finally got my 3\* Vampires Gauss Minigun today  it has 2 of the 3 effects I wanted and the second effect will help in the daily ops missions so massively happy, it's taken over 6 weeks scriping for modules and endlessly crafting for it since I decided on my final character build and what weapons I wanted.  
---
If I had been able to just make it though...  I wouldn't have leapt outta my chair, screaming "Yes" or knocked my cup of tea all over the dog, or had that huge buzz you get when something good happens for you, or even getting that "Look" from the girlfriend as she patted me on the head and handed me a towel to go bath the dog.  
---
Swings and roundabouts, i'l take the buzz/excitement,  rather than the satisfaction of getting everything I want.
---
Ironically my magic damage gauss minigunner does worse damage than my commando!
---
I had 5 people using gat pls explosive. Want that bad actually
---
Yeah I have that in my inventory and didn‚Äôt know what it starts so thank you
---
No problem. Learned this back when I was double dipping rifle and pistol perks on a pipe pistol. Easiest way to test it is to compare 1 rank in regular and expert vs 3 ranks in regular. Both should give you the same damage if additive.
---
Hunters
---
You're right I meant Morgantown
---
It seemed to in practice when I watched someone use it on PTS.
---
I remember exploring in the water in fallout 4 with paladin danse,  and he would get so pissy when you jumped in the water, "ugh, this isn't the *navy*".
---
They can - it‚Äôs listed under ‚Äújunk‚Äù. They can also sell the materials you need to process raw flux (which spoils pretty quickly to ‚Äúinert flux‚Äù which quenches thirst and is otherwise useless). You need glowing mass, hardened mass, and high-radiation fluid.
---
Yeah you can sell it. Go to some people's camps and you should find some in their vendors.
---
Honestly there is a willing audience for the game, the reason there was a huge backlash is because we wanted a better version of the game. If only they realized that.
---
Yes, and even bloodie and junkie got nerfed heavily, we still fight well and happy, but for others without decent equipment, they may encounter more trouble.
---
This is the Era for Vampire and Anti-Armor weapons!
---
Good thing about dupes is everything is cheaper if you play legit
---
The guns aren‚Äôt any less good just because they are duped dont forget
---
Are you on XBox?
---
I didnt know you could sell plans
---
Thanks. Yea I have been looking at camps and found none in two days. So I figured I'd ask.
---
My main is like 450ish and he doesn‚Äôt have a vendor but I ran another alt character that runs my store and just transfer caps when needed (2nd account)
---
We still waiting on this pic
---
If they decide to actually work
---
You‚Äôll want to have the ‚Äúworn veil‚Äù you looted from the girl‚Äôs corpse as well.
---
What platform are u on?
---
total congrats!  I am rolling for my last two pieces of uny armor still got some modules but ran out of of steel:)  I hope the dog did not get burned:)
---
I had a level 12 or so awhile back join my public team, he messaged me immediately to "hold on I'll be right there". Dropped me 2 radaways and a bunch of heart emojis. I was amused. What a sweetheart. I hooked him up with lots of aid.
---
What platform are you on?
---
It can take a while to find someone selling it but you'll find it eventually. It's in the junk tab so only go to camps selling junk.
---
Who cares what other people think?  If you enjoy a game, play it.  Don't let other's opinions about it keep you from that.
---
The price I pay for doing 50 damage to the SBQ
---
It's cold in these wasteland streets by yourself. MCTaxed
---
The hoarder in me just gives them to my other character.
---
That means you also missed Polly‚Äôs reward for giving her the correct body, probably.
---
Pc
---
Excavator is the best armor.  Defense differences are negligible at best.
---
I love you.
---
I still don't get why levels under 50 can do the event
---
Oh sorry, I have flux to spare but I‚Äôm on ps4 unfortunately.
---
Git gud, nerd. BTW, what platform u playing on? I might be able to help you not suck as much, dork.
---
Damn, you be looking just as much of a racist as the other guy with this statement. In my mind these are 2 seperate things. I know this isn't the place but fr the shit he commenting makes me cringe being half black myself. There are some bad people who happen to be black but not all are.
---
I think the "racist" is a troll looking for attention.  I certainly don't condone racism.
---
If you can‚Äôt find any the best way I get my flux is by beating ACP and SBQ the SBQ event gives you more flux than ACP
---
sell it to me.
---
Fireproof will help
---
My bad I had luck of the draw on still.
---
I wish I knew
---
I have max fireproof.
---
Yeah I do thanks
---
lol fireproof.  I believe there is a legendary perk coming also that may help.
---
Yeah it would be good. Im the same most times. I have the neon letters so i just write "I dont want it" or "You can have it" on a wall and walk away. If anyone does want it they can have it and know no one is coming after them.
---
I can say for sure that when I started I thought people just forgot about rads and was v confused until a buddy explained bloodied builds to me hahaha
---
I tried testing with and without fireproof on, doesn't help. OP, i don't have any suggestions for you apart from the good ole jump and shoot. Jetpack helps. As does not being detected.
---
I have the same effects on my 10mm &amp; as a junkie build, I get 73 i think damage with it &amp; I‚Äôm a vats critical build so I find it to be a awesome back up weapon that I never have to buy ammo for, It probably won‚Äôt sell for much but knowing how great mine is, I‚Äôd pay up to 10,000 caps for it if I didn‚Äôt already have mine.
---
Xbox one. My gt is Tenderroast1.
---
SO the TLDR is now you have to use stealth in a game with horrifically broken stealth mechanics....
---
The one redeeming aspect of Fallout 76 is the playerbase. 
---
I have a LOT of gripes with this game, but the people who play it are generally awesome.
---
First time I did it, did not bring nearly enough ammo lol. Ran out of shotgun and ended up using a lever action. Then the last enemy glitched and wouldn‚Äôt spawn so I quit, came back two months later and finished it lol
---
Oh I love the armor. But it's a lvl 25 and I have a lvl 50 t51 set that I'd like to switch things up with. And at the same time id like to pass my excavator to a buddy who is just hitting 20. 
---
Both of us have limited play time, so I try to give him a hand as much as I can.
---
Trigger discipline.
---
That's standard for the Nuclear Winter mode.
---
It's the usual colour = rarity model of many other games.
---
drops disappear after a half hour i think but if you put them in a container like the blue suitcases they will hang around a lot longer. I think until the server actually refreshes
---
Sure am. I've got limited time to play these days (same with my buddy). So I try to help him as much as I can when we can get on together.
---
I used to have no prob with it equipped using be gp. Maybe something has changed?
---
Oh hes playing nuclear winter! I played it once or twice when it released back then and havent touched it. Well okay
---
Except when he doesn't "come back next week!"
---
Damn sorry dude, I‚Äôm on ps4, I wish we had cross play because I would help you out, T51 is great
---
Explosive Tesla's don't arc so in theory they shouldn't have this problem. They shoot like an explosive machine gun
---
Did you finish main Wastelanders story or have you beat the game, including SBQ and Earle?
---
If not, do the main quest that let's you launch nukes and get after SBQ and Earle. You're lv 31 so i find it unusual you'd have beaten the game already!
---
Yeah the  dogs fine I was so engrossed in grinding for the resources for my crafting session i't had sat there and gone cold.  The GF however has been smug, patronising and slightly condescending ever since though :)  
---
When I was crafting my SS Vanguards, which took 78 modules for my full set, I'd try crafting on a server and if I didn't get a Vanguards piece in 5 crafts I swapped server, On one server I got 3 Vanguards pieces in 5 crafts 2, 3\* and 1, 2\*.  
---
It is probably a load of bull, but I really believe that different servers have different RNG generators, so its worth giving it a try if your struggling.
---
If you really love the game, make sure you have a very good password. I got an email from Bethesda with a permanent ban notice for my account despite not having played the game in months. My account covered an Xbox and a PC version. Either it's a mistake or my account was hijacked. I'm 55 years old and have never cheated in a video game, but they wouldn't budge. So I no longer play and will never have anything good to say about this company again. I'm glad you're enjoying it though.
---
ya I know, I look for them every single day on vendors, not many left out there :(
---
Yeah, the colours were not in NW at the start but they added it at some point (no idea when, i also barely touch it)
---
The tropes are all fairly easy to make in fo76.
---
heavy is easy and effective: Full health with a vamp minigun. make and chow down on meatball grinders.
---
Soldier is pretty ineffective. though you could imitate most aspects. SS jet pack for the "rocket jumps" and have a shovel and Missile launcher, both of which just suck.
---
Sniper is pretty easy too. Instigating hunting rifle of your choice or go compound bow. Could also go Bloodied for the "bleed aspect" of the snipers attacks.
---
Demo as pipe god who also uses melee can be done since heavy weapon and melee builds are close in special stats. Use grognaks axe and a two shot auto grenade launcher for funs and profit.
---
spy would be easy on stealth and ok with pistols. Maybe try a stealth build with a fast swing speed melee knife.
---
scout could be pretty effective two. Vats magic shotty and a baseball bat. speed demon for the fast aspect. Could make him a cola nut as well and rapid chug quantums.
---
I mean, that's what I do already, but it'd be nice to not have to
---
What weapon were you testing with? I use legacy laser rifles with split beam (and have been using them since before they became legacy) and fireproof has never done anything to reduce damage on those
---
Yeah Juicehead records footage over NW mode, His videos are a good source of info, I too often see things in video &amp; go hmm what‚Äôs happening there ha ha
---
Just build a lvl 50 version
---
30k caps?  Wonder how many of those caps were just wasted into the void. Grats
---
Add me as well, Freestateepp
---
I‚Äôll donate what I can
---
More events the better.
---
That said, I killed a flatwoods monster earlier tonight and felt really bad.
---
Oh right
---
Yeah i just youtube "Fallout 76 news" cause i was curious about BoS, just started playing again lastw eek
---
Have fun mate
---
The best way to do it is a fighting platform she lands next to not on , the mobs landing on it makes it a pain in the ass , way better to shoot down at them
---
You don't so best to have a melee for hot swap for those ghouls/wendigos. Really it comes down to knowing when you have to stop firing, nothing worse than turning yourself into a pile of goo and getting the respawn glitch where you have to force quit when doing scorched earth or ACP.   
---
I see people say fire proof but I am going to guess you have a splitter BE gat plasma, or split laser pistol/rifle you can survive those with fireproof on sometimes if you are just running 19% but that gat plasma fireproof does nothing.
---
Perfect!  I‚Äôll start doing this next time I log on.
---
I really like his commentary but as someone who has worked in video editing and filming, I am appalled at his laziness as he uses NW footage for any news announcement, while 99% of other YouTubers know how good b roll keeps the audience tuned in.
---
6 feet of separation please
---
What‚Äôs sbq, I did happen to beat Earle when I joined the event and got my a$$ carried but what is the main quest line if not wastelanders, bc I finished wastelanders
---
Both of those hats are from the Atomic shop. You can't trade them and you will only be able to purchase them if they pop up in the shop again. Same with the keeper outfit.
---
Add DiscupleofTzu if you would, I‚Äôll help however I can
---
Yeah needs to be like the queen where he stays in tact when he goes down.
---
Lol. Yeah, my BE gatling plasma is on extended loan to a buddy because I couldn't quit blowing myself up either.
---
The main questline is to attempt to eliminate the scorched threat. The biggest of them all is the Scorch Beast Queen.
---
You should find the quests in your main quests tab, it starts with the responders then moves to each faction.
---
Yup.  That's what I figured.  I know the distance and have a boring B25R15 gat plasma for close quarters
---
What?
---
You just don't shoot at things too close to you.
---
Be gp but this has been quite a while. When i didnt have fireproof equipped i kept blowing myself up
---
Also a father here with three little ones that don't like to sleep. I love 76 but I barely get an hour a night after they all go to sleep if I'm not too tired myself. I just recently upgraded my gpu so now I'm all PC again but its tough to play such a grindy game with very little time. Anyways I'm always looking to meet new fellow gamers I also have a lot of extras in 76 to help out new players, so anyone on PC wants to friend me shoot me a message
---
Dense and fireproof. If you run low hp then usually you are just shit out of luck.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the asbestos mod for the chest make u immune to fire damage?  Wouldn‚Äôt that work for explosive weapons.  I dunno I haven‚Äôt tried since I swished to all ffr weapons instead.
---
not struggling as of yet but the sale is messing with my rolls but I did get a TS ffr fixer so I can't bitch
---
If I‚Äôve beaten the SBQ does that fck the question up. Bc once again I beat it by getting carried
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never touched NW but it appears he loves it, I do wish he‚Äôd mix it up a bit more.
---
I‚Äôve only had one camp location since the beta so I never had too lol. So it will store everything exactly how I have it?
---
Fire and explosive are different
---
What was wrong with the nuke codes ?
---
Holy crap, that's beautifully done!  This needs more upvotes, dang.
---
There's an alien invasion.
---
It‚Äôs pretty spooky, I liked it but this sub definitely overhyped the shit out of it because it was the first piece of solid content we got after release.
---
Yeah if you move your camp slightly, everything gets stored as a blueprint. Pretty useful. The hard part is making whatever you built properly sit on the ground as the blueprint. Terrain is horrible in 76.
---
I dropped 20k caps on a soiled Mr. Fuzzy outfit and mask today just so I could turn my vendor back on and get some of this stuff out of my stash. I don't even know if the costume is worth anything but I didn't have it yet so wtf.
---
I joined an Encryptid event with probably 10 other people. Lowest was around lvl 50 and highest well over 250. It looked like everyone was running around like crazy and we all kept on dying. After about 10 min we finally killed the damn Assaultron but it took longer than any SBQ raid I've ever been a part of. I've never died to the SBQ and I died probably 5 times during that Encryptid event.
---
Makes since.  Yeah blowing myself up is one of many reasons I got all my explosives stored and only using ffr ones now.
---
Have like 20 explosive harpoon guns...what platform are you on?
---
Hey it's all good. I appreciate it.
---
I also hop camps a lot to search for plans/items etc. I‚Äôve seen these at almost all the camps I go to. Low lv and high level, so they going to have a much bigger issue on their hands. I‚Äôm a casual player so I‚Äôm only level 156.
---
Wait low levels don‚Äôt run from you??!!
---
so my wife is not happy with this game at all but at least she is happy with our marriage...I hope&gt;)
---
They did not reset properly, some servers had last weeks codes, some had this week, and some were completely broken with no codes which meant people couldnt launch at all.
---
I wouldnt think so unless you did most of the steps that would lead you up to it on your own.
---
.
---
Spoiler:
---
Like being able to join the Brotherhood of Steel, the Enclave, getting access to nukes and other restricted areas, having access to their gear and plans. Those make it worth it to have completed main quest on at least one character.
---
If I wanted to keep using an excavator I would. Also dont have the mod plans to do anything to the excavator either as it was given to me fully loaded.
---
Sbq sucks, and do you even do acp?
---
I assume from the utmost quality gambling establishment in all of Appalachia?
---
And for this reason i use a b2525 fixer now
---
You want a flotilla, that‚Äôs how you get a flotilla.
---
I've got stims, ammo, plenty of food and legendary guns that could help you out buddy! I'm a father as well I work a 9am to 9pm job, I've got two teens and I usually only play late at night as well and I usually only play with my one good buddy its just us and we wouldn't mind to have a third to hang around with, team up and share our spoils of war he's super helpful too, I'm a level 152. I'll even help you with your perk load out too if you want. Hit me up on Xbox my GT is: Awktahvio. Just send me a message after you add me so I know it's you good sir! Hope to hear from ya! It's a vicious wasteland out there but the community is super friendly and supportive even during these trying times cause well, we all know War, War never changes.

Peace love and chicken grease!

Oh ok, I haven‚Äôt even completed the responder portion I think, I‚Äôm on the step where I enter abbys bunker I think
---
This. Im a lever 29 and I keep getting my ass handed to me by level 62 glowing things. Jesus christ.
---
They did mention it in the article when discussing daily ops, it‚Äôs coming in the Tuesday patch
---
Hehe I've been moving over to handmades and fixers as well of late. Used to run rifleman before I saw the light.
---
Oh shit was he there by the time you do that quest?
---
I do have her old head, and that was the last time I went to the Wayward, but that was before I launched finished the main story quests, so I don't know if that's a factor.
---
Is he just tucked away in the corner or something? I barely remember the Wayward at this point.
---
Same, I just started playing a week or two ago. I was super confused about why high levels were full of rads until I found this subreddit.
---
No I agree, I miss the old Fallout 3 style, I do like that the PA looks bigger but not the chassis &amp; other changes.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, I play with my little brothers and step dad fairly often. If you want to play anytime I‚Äôd be more than glad to play with you, just lmk! I just started a couple of weeks ago and I‚Äôm lvl 80 already, but I straight up no life it after work until my fianc√© yells at me. üòÇ
---
Armor penetration. It let's them ignore DR when they attack
---
Easy solution...nuke their camp...they get the hint and probably leave the server
---
He's upstairs on the couch.
---
Fallout First is kinda lame
---
Yes much better overall and the game changed for me when i started doing commando stealth build
---
&gt;I could make pyro but idk
---
*muffled insane screaming*
---
Lol Bethesda
---
Ok fine that made me chuckle. Take my upvote
---
Not much hits hard enough to warrant huge DR values after all the %reduction from blocker and dodgy. If you aren't wearing armor, I guess you could keep it. Otherwise it is pretty redundant.
---
Thats a nice roll, I havn't got the fixer plan yet, so can't get the rolls for it, its what swung my decision towards a Vanguards Heavy/Shotgun build, I was looking  to do a bloodied/junkies rifle/commando,  but after completing 3 attempts that I started at the imposter event and not getting the plans I gave up on that idea, i'l be damned if i'm going to pay 10-15K caps for a plan.  
---
My GF is happy that i'm tucked quietly (mostly) in a corner where she can keep an eye on me lol, if it wasn't for the dog she'd have left me years ago LMAO
---
Meanwhile I can't even find meat hook or guitar sword plans and I'm level 80 almost. *Shrug*
---
Any further mention of it has gone silent so who knows. It was talked about as a coming feature but it seems to have been relegated to an unknown future update if it ever happens at all. I think they got a bit of push back about it so who knows
---
No but it needs to be a thing
---
RIP respecers who lose out on perk coins, but I'm usually shat on for pointing out this fucked up system.
---
Can't wait to get rid of perk cards. I think I'm more excited about that
---
It's when the halloween deco goes up in stores. From a consumerist pov, if ya wanna get political
---
This community is amazing.
---
Oh yeah, I recently ran into a low level player's camp with 3 of them placed to the side. It's because high level idiots have put them down for them or they found out about the exploit from some moron on youtube. I'm level 300 something, haven't been on much after the whole legendary run thing ended. Was on once a few days ago just to deal with my fo1st subscription. I'm seeing a lot of dumb people putting them up in their camp. I won't be surprised if another ban wave eliminates half of the population of players for the game.
---
There is some video on YouTube about it.  Basically you build a wall, destroy it somehow, the youtube video used a fire trap, then in the same spot build a wall with the interior portion facing the opposite direction then repair all structures.  Then you will having a wall that is an interior on both sides so you can put wallpaper on either side.  This can be done with contemporary walls but not sure what others.
---
1080p. I've tried all settings I've been playing this since NW came out. Tried every ini too.
---
I did have 1 with maybe 3 or 4 other people. And it was alot crazier. Not sure about elsewhere but I had tons of enemies with a few small breaks.
---
Though usually I'm solo and it's the other way round
---
Interesting. What level?
---
ü§£üòÇü§£ü§£
---
Downvoted for being gullible and believing this sob story lol
---
Thanks for all you do man, I was able to launch and solo the queen earlier because of you!
---
I had been holding off cuz of the bug going on, and got pretty pumped when I saw your site was back to just listing the codes and came here to confirm.
---
Ah damn gotta look more into this.
---
That's cool. Got more than enough upvotes. ü§£
---
Yea this guy put it right in the middle of my camp...  Next time I‚Äôm on I‚Äôm going to do what you said. I really don‚Äôt see the benefit in it as I‚Äôm a semi auto sneak hybrid melee build so no need for ammo like that. Only reason I stumbled on this thread was because I thought it was something legit that I was having trouble moving it or deleting it. Now I know why obv lol.
---
I‚Äôm mostly asking if the attitude toward the game is justified. I‚Äôll keep playing it regardless if it‚Äôs good or not because hey, I get a kick out of it
---
It's just they don't aggro and mine walk like 5 miles to get to the event at the slowest pace possible. It's like you think it would be hard but is just tedious lol
---
&gt; Alternatively, if you have a high enough Agility and/or use Chinese  Stealth Armor/Chameleon Armor...use a Railway. Ideally an explosive one,  if you can get your hands on it. It's not as loud as it seems... 
---
Yesterday i got an Anti Armor Explosive one, call Denzel Washington cuz im hijacking this train B)
---
Isn‚Äôt there cutting fluid in blow torch‚Äôs?
---
Barely affected as I run an AA build. Due to Follow Through I might actually do a bit more then I am
---
now on live. The main people seeing huge losses are bloodied and to a lesser extent, junkies.
---
Add jconley123...same thing father of 2 working 2 jobs...play for about an hour at night..but I got stuff you can have...and can also make gear just like all these guys
---
yeah I feel you better to just buy that plan that's what i did back in the day when they first came out.  I have just recently switched from junkie commando to bloodied but still have no bloodied commando weapons HA!  But I do roll with a bloodied gauss shot gun so that's nice.  So If I ever get that plan again I will give it to you cause I feel the same.  I got it for 5 K in somebodies shop a long time ago.  Never got it from the event though.  My wife gives me the evil eye when she gets home but I do paythe car insurance:)
---
Just seems a huge waste of time and effort, good way to grief the griefers tho üëç
---
I guess this is the new trend, freaking out if something doesn't get mentioned.
---
Crazy. Do you have game mode enabled? What does the read say? Are you getting weird cpu spikes and drops? I get those right now on my intel/nvidia setup because there's something weird going on right now. But they seem to have fixed it for me at least with the latest performance tweaks on the PTS. So hopefully it will be better soon. Otherwise maybe check something like changing ipresetinterval and then using radeon settings to activate vsync instead of relying on the game's vsync
---
Forgot the pipe wrench to fix all the broadsiders
---
Yeah, definitely try moving your camp, that's the only solution so far as to getting rid of it so you don't end up having to deal with some dick reporting you for it. It's an exploit, and people who are using it or forcing it upon others should be punished.
---
I did!  That sale is great!
---
I'm on quite often, I can definitely relate to gaming as a parent and may have some items to pass on üòÖ Tag is Gigapoodipoodi.
---
Weld them together with one more and make a dragon broadsider.
---
Not sure.
---
I like it the way it is, but I want the fast animation 100% of the time.
---
Can't wait for stuff to be broken and everything to be nerfed.
---
Man some people here really don't think at all. We already get options to join squad leaders instance or to create our own instance. They could've made something like this. 
---
Choose squad leaders choices 
---
or
---
Do not choose squad leaders choices
---
That's literally it. You could then communicate with your friend about what choice you guys should make. If you end up not liking the choices your friend made, then you could get the option to restart the quest by putting a little button beside the quest in your pipboy.
---
I lol'd
---
They fixed it! You can now snap walls so you can put wallpaper on both sides. You have to start both pieces as a door and place the first one, then snap the other one over it and then you can edit and change them to walls. For some reason it didn't with when I used the plain wood but it definitely works with brick.
---
If you're buying duped guns, you're not really playing legit

(AND REPTILIANS)
---
Nice.we have a few more days hope u get something good
---
I thought it was a sentry bot when I first saw it, it sounds similar to one and has the same bulky frame. But I saw assaultron in the name and got confused until it came close. Because I sure as hell didn't choose to come close to it
---
Duped hell probably hand crafted toooooooo
---
Thanks for the tip, I've been dropping mine but I'll start doing the same!
---
I had a level 6 or 7 revive my dumb ass after I blew myself up. I was waiting to see if my armor would pick me back up and he ran over and revived me before I could get on my mic and tell him not to. I dropped him about 50 stims and about 500 rounds of 38 for his pipe pistol
---
xfubarx805 a noob as well
---
Why did the calmex matter? There's no way level 30s had good enough builds to stay hidden from earle, and if he detected them you wouldn't be getting sneak crits
---
You are my hero sir! I dont get why everyone wants to spend ammo and waste 20 mins fighting the guy when we can drop in a couple of minutes. Flux, notes, plans, 3* item for the least amount of work is a win win.
---
God I just love this community
---
So is it like recipes once I have it I will always know it or I have to have it in my inventory for it to be usable?
---
I still @work. Judging from the responses I've gotten though I may have confused my psychos.
---
The best place would be to ask in a discord or subreddit that focuses on trading. Some players will put it in their vendors but they're usually overpriced. I'll msg you some decent places.

3 star luck of the draw and gunsmith 5. I viewed early on why waste 9 points for 60% when you get 30% for 3 points so I went with QoL on my characters. It has made my journey easy, then with my legacies and built in magic guns that I had before this round of magic even started, bullets just do not matter and repairs are rare. I will admit I still have an issue with my armor seems my legs break every two days my torso though is around 150% and that has been 3 weeks since I made it.  
---
My PA character had to repair an arm once think that character is 124 or 114 that is excavator lvl 45 to their current level.  So adjusting to regular normal armor has been a thorn but with legendary perks that fixes my issue since I can get more QoL armor perks.
---
It's great for power levelling!
---
Thank you, ty, THANK YOU!! Yes please. This bug is my personal hell every day all day.

---
Are you a teacher?
---
They have a repair bench in ACP if all else fails :)
---
If you don't have the starched genes perk then they will take atleast one of them away.
---
It was probably just another case of copy/pasting from fo4. There was a far harbor diver suit that gave you underwater breathing, and it seems like in the files they just took every effect that exists, because there's even the durability one that the bos PA had. You can see plenty of residual effects of lazy copy/pasting in the game, like 4/5 star legendary effects, radrat/wolf HP being ridiculously high compared to their molerat/dog counterparts, handmade drums having a ridiculous amount of ammo for a year, etc. It does make me wonder whether they intended to have more to do underwater, since I believe there isn't much other than at those two flooded quarries and a little easter egg in a lake somewhere
---
I think I was still below level 50 when I did it.  Over and over and over....
---
Im new to the game. Is a duped gun a gun someone made with hacks and scripts? Like cheating?
---
Can't you think for yourself and form your own opinions? Wrong to like a game because some people don't like it?
---
Dude, just do you. You're really letting people's hate boners get to your head.
---
Thanks. My sister passed away unexpectedly last week. It‚Äôs been rough.
---
You have to be a platinum card holder and it‚Äôs 1200 a night.

Gotcha
---
https://youtu.be/JpkmQ_U-3uA
---
As opposed to now where 90% of people play the same Bloodied or Junkies build....?
---
Sounds like bethestas game code is spaghetti.  Id wager its a bug
---
If getting older has taught me anything it's this; You don't need to make an excuse for liking something, unless it's harmful or dangerous of course. 
---
Your tastes are yours. 
---
Most of the controversy this game recieved at launch was pretty unfounded and mostly reactionary tbh, and I ignored it and have enjoyed the game and the changes since B E.T.A.
---
Of course the game is not without faults, but to expect perfection is always going to leave a person disappointed or angry.
---
You do you bud, if you enjoy it keep playing with a smile. ü§ó
---
If PvP wasn't unbalanced this would be awesome. But it'll end up being duped assassin gear and no fun. Be cool if they balanced weapons to nuclear winter and let us try it
---
Yep it's gone, you need the communist skin if you want an automatic handmade with a cover
---
Change their name. I dont script anything starting with **
---
Yea doesn‚Äôt matter what the primary effect is on the armor as long as it has the blocking one. The point of the 33% vats hits chance, bashing damage or one other secondary effect I forget on the weapon is that you won‚Äôt need a piece of armor with the blocking. As long as you have one of them you are good. Search YouTube for fallout 76 magic shotgun that will explain and show you better
---
With Patch 22 it will be a place we visit more often.

Unless you are there to farm wendigos for ultracite 5mm. I like taking time in there, blowin nuggets off and every third one has 140 rounds for my 6-7 rounds spent.
---
Well said. Thanks for the comment :)
---
Oh wow
---
It is shit.  Even in FO 4 it was shit.   And the HUD is abysmal.    Even if PA became Legerndary I wouldn't use it for that .  Prefer the NV mod that inspired it.
---
Thanks for posting.  I've been hearing it's a 40% damage reduction with current numbers unachievable even after legendary perks. Really should come with a  general weapon balance anyway.  Looks like I'm being forced into bloodied by this.
---
200 free 5.56 is nothing to sneeze at while I'm building
---
I suspect it is not going to happen, with adding a legendary perk that a core part of its benefit is dealing with hunger and thirst it would seem odd to turn around and remove that mechanic from the game.  Some clarification from Beth. would be nice so people don't spend perk coins upgrading this card.
---
There are plenty of other things like that too. 10mm smg sights, pump action sights/sight rail, and .44 revolver bull barrel come to mind. There are plenty of weapons (mostly new ones) that also have tons of mod slots but no mods for them. The LMG is just sad to look at, has barrels, magazines, receivers, muzzles, yet only has a prime receiver to mod it. I also remember seeing a post about datamined attachments like the 10mm sharpshooter grip being missing
---
I wish I could push that hard when working out. I keep playing the game instead, even when my frames drops to 5 and my cpu becomes Belching Betty
---
Like sugar mammas?
---
WHAT IS IT
---
Yeah I think they changed the amount of damage torso armor takes so it doesn't break as often.
---
I was in caution the whole time
---
I think I know the location you have your base in, I heard there‚Äôs like a central enemy spawn point around there so it‚Äôs prob why you‚Äôre seeing so many grouped up together, once saw a group of at least 20 radstags all together getting attacked by yao guai around the same area
---
dunno, but I've gotten a Valley Galleria sign (from an op in Vault 94, oddly), a V94 Vault Suit plan, the super generator (yeah, shame about the power output vs footprint), and the caged lights plan (it's basically 2 variants (length) of a string of lights (3-5?) that're just little yellow lights in metal cages.)
---
Does it affect an explosive lever action or does the base damage need to be explosive?
---
Here is the advertising from Bethesda.net

Hi guys, am I late for the ‚Äúfallout 76 is actually not a bad game if I ignore all of its flaws‚Äù circlejerk?
---
I play a full Health Junkie's PA/Shotgunner/Stealth Rifleman/Commando Hybrid, and I was doing perfectly fine on the PTS. You do **not** need to go Bloodied if you do not want to. 
---
All damage is relative to how fast it kills the thing you're fighting. That's why I didn't specify any numbers in this post: they don't mean anything in practical terms. 
---
Current numbers are not achievable, that is correct. However, they were never necessary for viable play. Not even close. This **should** come with a weapon rebalance, yes, but for some reason it isn't. The reason is probably deadlines. :(
---
How the hell does a tesla arcs have explosive bullets
---
People like me who prefer solo play find it very useful.
---
That‚Äôs a common location for a radstag herd. Which means ‚Äî herd=radstag+Yao Guai or Snally or Scorpions
---
It affects Explosive legendary effect weapons, too! Just not as much as Gauss or actual Explosives.
---
Sure, but I tend to have so much radaway that I drop it, the brief moments I cross water is not worth wasting a perk on.
---
Eh. I've been on the PTS. Bloodied HW/Explo main, Bloodied Stealth VATS Rifleman/Commando (perks for all), Bloodied Stealth 1h Melee (perks for all melee), and Full-Health Junkie's Unarmed (although I switch up and use shotguns a lot). 
---
My Bloodied HW main has the easiest time of... everything.
---
Just running the recent Daily Op (V94, Super Mutants, Camoflague), my Bloodied Rifleman switched up perks a little (dumped stealth and VATS since neither would work there) and using a Bloodied Gauss rifle hipfiring fully charged shots, I was doing fine. Granted, I was doing it with a group, but Daily Ops groups are all over the PTS and do great. I was 2shotting supermutants with random body shots. It wasn't great, but it was fine. And I got WAAAAY more ammo than I'll ever need since Daily Ops groups automatically put you all in the same Op instance, which means since you're already in a group, every single kill in the instance that you're nearby, you can loot for ammo. 1-3 shots per enemy, but 4-18 ammo per enemy? Yeah...
---
Bloodied Melee guy felt a little more useless; I was sitting on the repeaters to speed up the completion, and so I was basically doing nothing else; didn't want to leave it to chase down enemies attacking from range because speed&gt;killing in the op. But he did fine too, even without much in the way of tanking perks (blocker and serendipity, maybe? Not even sure he runs blocker since he's usually stealthy).
---
Junky had no problem; my biggest frustration is not having mods on the PTS (it may be doable, I haven't investigated) so I'm reaalllly missing my perk loadout manager for swapping between unarmed and shotguns.
---
What I'm saying is if you've got a well set up character, you can still do the ops just fine, and groups just make it easymode even to get Elder rank. We 3manned it to 6:30 pretty easily.
---
Record what happened in the last longest time and see if you can see his gt
---
I presume this is what they will introduce with the patch 23 (as they said, it's the second part of the rebalance), but we'll need to wait yet another month for it to happen unfortunately...
---
Even better when you're in Passive Mode and you get popped before you can either leave or disable it.
---
Check the recent player list
---
Living in it is what keeps me hooked. Even though its a hostile world where everything wants to kill you, its a beautiful world thats been my place to just be when I'm not being a good employee or being a dad or a husband.
---
only recorded the minute or two since i restarted the game after the blue screen
---
...It's just the stealthboy/Chameleon effect. The annoying part is it only drops for like 1.5 seconds after they attack, then it kicks back in. VATS is almost useless
---
‚ÄúThey fixed it!‚Äù 
---
*proceeds to explain convoluted process to accomplish goal*

I have had so many comments I thought were witty or funny and this is the one I get my first reward on lol well thank you!  I greatly appreciate it
---
Save.  Wait for the new Season to reap the challanges.
---
Same reason how your bullets are more lethal the more wounded you are, or how your armor can make you stronger the weaker you are.

It's nuke-magic, Bethesda ain't gotta explain shit.

We bloody builds would die before we'd ever use a stimpack!

Sounds like what happened to me a week or so ago where Todd started dumping atoms onto my account endlessly before swiftly pointing the finger at the big red button to disable my atom shop/ first subscription.. Possibly happening again and you got dealt the unlucky draw? I would recommend checking their twitter a few times over the next few hours in case they post about it.. other than that i would suggest cashing in a support ticket

I only put up the ones that took me longer to find and adjust the price based on how rare I think it is,

 seems to work pretty well..

If you dont plan on getting a month of fallout 1st to go on a scrapping spree to fill your unlimited junk storage, start getting every bit of plastic you see. Bulk all your junk. Start early and youll thank yourself later when it comes to stash space.

The game fundamentally changes for everyone next week, so its a good time to play. Hope you enjoy it!

Yeah, it's...not what I would do. At all. But it's what we've got.

challenges. Was a glitch last where where people got millions of atoms.  Did you get them?  Was that near your renewal date?  Could be tied to that.

Unrelated(maybe) , but (Xbone) I logged on today and had the Atomic Shop free items unclaimed for all 1st items I had.  A few restarts later was still there, joined a public server fixed it.

what about engineer?

This makes me want to give praise to the Holy Mothman.

Even when it does get mentioned
---
Jesus Fucking Christ how are people this thick.
---
Tell me then, how much bigger are the expanded building areas?  How much bigger a budget will you get?  How do persistent workshops work?  When is any of this being added to the game?
---
You can't answer because they haven't given ANY details on any of this shit yet.
---
I'm not denying that ANY of this has been mentioned before because of fucking course it has.  I'm telling you that their mentioning future features has ZERO FUCKING INFLUENCE ON ANYTHING right now.  You're not getting any less than your moneys worth because they haven't introduced any of that yet, you're getting the EXACT fucking features they've advertised as being in the game RIGHT NOW. if you are currently signed up for 1st then you knew fucking well that you weren't getting ANY of that shit and if that's the stuff you're actually interested in then you shouldn't be subscribing when it doesn't fucking exist yet.
---
You signed up for 1st AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW.  They don't owe you shit beyond that until anything else is implemented.
---
Of course it's "viable". But it's not going to be as good as a PA build- Stabilized is a big difference.
---
But I could see a Bloodied VATS build leveraging the massive AP pool that Unyielding gets, combined with opening from stealth for huge burst damage, to absolutely murder anything that's not a boss. But on boss-type enemies, you're not going to be as effective as a PA version.
---
I just got the other daily quest. Took 4 hours.
---
They should just add a bunch of new creatures at once. Imagine wastelanders that instead of npcs and new quest lines we got like 20 new cryptids.

I on the other hand always accept random trades. Most of them have the decency not to ask for my BE handmade or BE laser, and if I spot that I‚Äôm running low on supplies, e.g. disease cures and antibiotics I can buy them if the other guy puts up a price. Same applies to common/uncommon plans I don‚Äôt know yet.
---
This is exactly me, but as a single mom and level 95.  I have just barely started to change to a real sniper build, but usually don't have time to figure it out so I'm not that powerful. I haven't even finished some of the main quest lines because I usually don't have time for them between my daughter getting to bed and falling asleep with my laptop still running the game at night. Oh well, I'll get there eventually. Glad I'm not the only one with a higher level build that's way behind compared to my level. I wish we were on the same system so I could friend you, but alas...
---
Iirc you can buy lunchboxes in the next big update, 100 gold for 3. If this is outdated info now I apologize.

I never get cool rewards like that. I still haven‚Äôt even gotten most of the camp trap plans

What mask is that...

Not that I noticed. Far as I know I still have around 7k atoms.

Hopefully I can get the tan fireman uniform this year. On Xbox One. If anyone is willing and has it, I'd pay 8000 caps.

not nearly as big a problem since rad sponge only triggers on people who're actually physically nearby.

Yes, and by the full interpretation of literally any game with an online component, you have no rights to the game you paid for and they can revoke your user privileged at any time without cause and without notice. That's built into *every* online game. They don't just invoke it for lulz on people, and usually not to silence critics (it *can* happen, but rarely does, because that's a EA-Battlefront-Cash-Shop level shitstorm in the making), it's there for when it is time to shut down the servers so people don't sue them over an obvious consequence of playing an online game, or so they can ban cheaters and point to the TOS rather than go through the process of documenting their bullshit. It may not get them off the hook, but it does bend the fight heavily in their favor.
---
Same applies to damn near everything, from language requirements for forum posts to the older kinds of mattress tags (you know, the ones that said "do not remove on pain of legal repercussions", until it became such a meme that they updated the text to now say "don't remove unelss you're the owner"). It's not there to use, it's there to cover ass when stupid people do stupid things and you want them to stop or at least not sue you for their stupidity.
---
Jesus, they can't be bothered to answer bug reports made directly to them, do you really think they're going to virtual gestapo our asses if we talk about a bug? Why not just ban everyone with the same IP as reddit posters who complain? That would probably take *less* work than hunting them down on a live server and hovering around their voice chat feed to catch their nefarious conversation about the fucking queen glitching into the ground again.

I hate getting stuck like that...I need a ssd!
---
No one thinks they aren't affected by the damage changes. It's simply a question of how significant an impact it is.
---
For bloodied builds, it's very significant. But also very necessary.
---
Does it still tell you how many atoms you have in the bottom right? When this similar situation happened to me mine read 0
---
FSP?
---
I'm not even at level 100 yet and I already feel this so much. I really hated the idea of having a mule, I just want everything In my stash for easy access. But I finally had to cave and just make a mule character and I absolutely hate it lol. Stash limits, caps limits, scrip limits. Why not just put a limit on the amount of time I can play? Basically would do the same thing as all these annoying damn limits. Definitely a part of the game that drags it down in quality and enjoyment pretty hard.
---
Broadsider is the most useless weapon. So weak. Should have a base damage of 1500 and a very slow reload time but make the ammo very rare and retrievable
---
If on Xbox also have first will help you out.
---
Downvote instead of asking for clarity. Typical.
---
Yeah I wish PvP was limited to just a couple events on the map, like how GTA has a couple events where you get put into a small closed off section of the map and fight with standardized gear.
---
Personally I don't think PvP can work in this game. You can just make yourself far too strong and do too much bullshit damage stacking with legendaries for PvP to be anywhere close to fair.
---
Nuclear Winter is good because you get standard gear and perks specifically balanced for PvP. Hell, they could just put a fully fleshed out PvP system into its own mode with its own currency, but make the rewards useable in adventure mode. New plans, new weapons, C.A.M.P. furniture, outfits, etc.
---
Story wise it could just be a simple faction battle mode or something where you play as a random NPC member of the raiders or the settlers in a 4v4 TDM or S&amp;D type mode just like the Last of Us multiplayer (which was super fun imo).
---
Well then go along and eat their shit without even trying to make it better in any way. Mindsets like yours are making them to continue this way.
---
I love threads like this!! LMAO
---
Close the game and reload in.some other people had issues with atom shop latley
---
you can mute them and enjoy the buff of being in a team
---
Ok
---
How about no?
---
Ooh yeah shame me mama
---
How the fuck? What level are you? How often and for how long do you play?
---
LoL.i can picture this happening
---
You can add me too - Lafaette Lulu
---
You are only supposed to get 1 of those a day as well. And I'm fairly certain it's not simply going to give you one you don't already have in your quest log- say, you have Dross Toss and Lucky Mucker in your quest log. You log in on a new day; the game rolls 3, lands on Lucky Mucker. You already have it. You get no new daily for the Ash Heap that day.
---
just happened to me. fuck this garbage event.
---
They're exclusive to the Atom Ship, and came out last Thanksgiving, and only came back once, a few weeks ago.
---
Chances are you'll see it this coming Thanksgiving as well.
---
What about 27 radtoads?
---
I'm a weekend warrior and a casual.  Lvl 64.   Nephilim of sin if interested.  This isn't my primary game, so I play for fun/SCORE.  Can devote probably an hour M-Th currently.
---
Thank you so much! Damn I wish they had cases that looked similar even.
---
Empath, Herd Mentality, and Strange in Numbers all say "hi"
---
What clarity is needed to be asked exactly? I was making fun of the idea of ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù while relaying a convoluted process of achieving the goal. ‚ÄúFixed it‚Äù implies that, well, they‚Äôve add the feature without unnecessary bullshit.
---
I don't bother picking up anything 1-star (unless bloodied or worth more than 100 or so caps). And the 2-star stuff better be really light or have a good roll. I sort my stash by weight and then just pick from the top when it comes time to scrap my legendary stuff.
---
If you are taking about the area with a toxic river going through it then yes you are absolutely correct. It‚Äôs super bizarre!
---
I managed to get my paws on a quad broadsider and figured if any broadsider would be good it would be that one...nope I remember the junk cannon from older fallouts blasting teddy bears exploding enemies...nothing like that
---
You loose all of your junk items, nothing else. Back when we had survival mode, you would also loose some of your aid items.
---
Stabilized perk makes PA almost necessary. The ignore 45 percent armor is great.  hand in hand with an anti armor weapon and IMO its better than junkies. Makes the Final word a great gum.  I bought 2 prkmed the other one lol.
---
Fissure Site Prime
---
Yeah prolly going junkies too. On console so cant do pts, but have a junkies explosive sg that could be... Fun
---
Losing our armor and guns? How about we just don't lose our stable flux instead.
---
No news are good news.
---
I rocked tse then got on the energy exolosive train and like u guys say a b2525 Hm or fixer is definitely the ticket.
---
Guarantee you if they changed the system or buffed the limit we'd have top posts within a week complaining about "I spent 5 hours grinding legendaries to scrip and now I have full god roll stuff, I'm bored"
---
That's why I use them for you.  Ya'll get team medic like it or not.
---
No worries, worth a shot ;-)
---
I fixed it. Had to reboot not only the game but the system as well.
---
Hey what console do you play on if it‚Äôs xb1 I can help ya out I have plenty of connections and I can give you tips
---
Too get those sweet screws, and to farm wendigos for ammo
---
It could still happen, and PVP would still be in the game(in a form). With the success with Nuclear Winter, and with a proper future update. They could move PvP away from the main game to solely that since the overall population seems to prefer PvE gameplay. They could still include instanced PvP moments, via certain events or duel requests or etc(this is common with MMOs). 
---
Just having a feature, just to have a feature doesn't necessarily make it a good feature to keep in forever, especially since the majority of the player base prefers something else. Also with the way they are continually moving to events that cause the player base to band together, I could see them just scrapping it eventually or heavily limiting it. Games always need to adapt to meet the needs and demands of the player base, which was one reason they removed the PvP game mode.
---
I suppose nows the time to be grinding em for those level ups. After grinding burrows 5 or 6 times the layout comes together
---
I have a mismatch set of unyeilding with a few cavalier and sentinel pieces and use fireproof 3  and maybe it's just normal but I survive about 25% from splash damage at low health.usually when I get overwhelmed
---
Took me awhile too. I tried everything.  I found a .50 cal and collected ammo for a week. When I went back I ‚Äúby accident‚Äù had focused on the legs and kept firing and running. Eventually she fell on her stomach and that made it easier to finish her off.
---
Good stuff glad to hear it. Enjoy the wandering! And scrap box
---
that gun.
---
OK bud. Whatever you say.
---
It seemed like you were confused by the process. I thought the previous method of using fire traps and manipulating the game into getting double walls was convoluted, but whatever.
---
Awesome shot!  I love running into those mobs!
---

It‚Äôs all luck man. Those outfits that drop anyway you have less than a 1% chance.
---
Bloodied heavy with sneak attacks does decent damage. The main issue is accuracy and penetration. Anti armor isn't too bad.
---
If you play on Xbox I can help you out when i am on. I had the bug hit me on my newest toon and ju.ped to my private server to fix it.  Worked like a charm
---
Kung fu, let me know if you need some more stuff
---
Fix the "A Colossal Problem" shit where if I die then Earlie dies while I'm respawning, I get transported out of the event. 
---
That shit pisses me off. I avoid that event.
---
The game saves that you inserted the blood sample.  You won't need another.
---
I just wanted to be able to transfer a bunch of scrip legendaries from one character to another without having the chance of someone snagging it or bothering a courier for multiple trades. Cheers!
---
Do you just do the quest as normal but on a private server? Or is there some workaround that only works on private servers?
---
[Down for me as well.](https://i.imgur.com/GZJJVsL.png)
---
At lvl100, they should turn into chocobos and be mountable.
---
Damn... I'm on PC! But thank you for the offer! Good to know that the private server thing is real, though.
---
You do the lat part of the quest just like normal.  All I had to do was insert the t fuse and go to the computer.
---
You know what's useless?
---
Teams full of morons eating potato chips in their mics.
---
Oooh... Thank you! I was quite concerned as I hadn't seen anyone mention that part of the problem. Thought it was only me somehow.
---
THAT'S NOT ALL!  Oh wait yep it was...
---
That sucks. I was able to fix mine by rebooting the system. Hopefully that works for you.
---
You might watch your in game friends list and see if any of them are in a pvt server then shoot them a message asking to visit.
---
Will do
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH
---
That was my strategy - go for the legs and get her down. Then you can easily run away and heal up between shooting sessions. The hard part is getting her down initially. Part luck, part skill. Good luck!
---
When the Queen dies, the event is over and you are then able to aggro other players if you don't have pacifist on. Griefers would jump in front of other players while they were finishing off the mobs thereby forcing them into PVP. Player is then killed  and awards the griefers with not only junk but pure flux. Bethesda's solution was to have flux always disappear whenever the player dies. Didn't stop the griefing but at least they didn't get the flux either.
---
&gt; And the HUD is abysmal.
---
You can disable the god awful power armor hud in the game settings. How anyone could actually like it is a mystery to me.
---
How can I ever repay you?
---
You still need help? You on? My gt is TheHighHeat
---
Now I'm a believer
---
Freaking out? I asked a simple question one time because they didn't mention it.
---
Yesterday I‚Äôm standing in the middle of the pack, put about 900 rounds of 5.56mm into the SQB (seeing decent damage numbers) and she drops out of the sky with no loot.  Second time in two days. 
---
At least I got my2* Instigating Security Baton for finishing the event üôÑ
---
Don't use a vendor as a display and people won't use your vendor the way it's supposed to be used lmao
---
Try to find as many ‚Äúpristine‚Äù items in the game world as you can. Pre War Lamp, Vault Tec Alarm Clock, Untarnished Tin Can. It‚Äôs a good excuse to revisit old areas.
---
Search for portable power packs and osmosis kits laying around on the ground. Not super common but incredibly useful to anyone who has one. They sell well, but I have more fun just hoarding them.
---
I have made 5 different characters in the 1 1/2 years I have played and have noticed that every new one you find new stuff you do better with guns and ammo, and some how food and water are easer to get
---
Would if I could, haha. Don't actually have any friends that play the game- none on my friends list either. I've been mostly running around, figuring stuff out by myself. And honestly, not even sure *how* to add people.
---
Hey I'm on Xbox. Did you get any heavy weapons that I could buy or trade for?
---
Vendor shouldn't be used as a display case
---
How about just making PvP great again and rereleasing survival. Cola chuggers lose their aid when they die so it discourages that style of game play, they get their own server so less griefing, and you get an actual survival game instead of this bullshit. This game was designed to be lawless wasteland but it keeps getting held back with every update by societal morals that wouldn't exist.
---
With the diminishing returns you get when stacking aa junkies is much better when running stabilzed
---
Is that a Scorched one? I've never encountered one of those. That's a nice shot as well.

---
Dad here,  the community here is great. My six year old loves building camps, except for some people who kept destroying his spot because they wanted it everyone here has been great at teaching him good multiplayer conduct.  On the Xbox one myself don't have my tag handy so will look it up and edit later.
---
Typically it‚Äôs caused rapid firing the gun. Also happens on the gauss pistol.
---
If outdoors, jump and fire. In indoors, be very careful.
---
Meh, this games combat is laughably easy as it is. The main complaint I've had lately is that everything dies too fast for me to participate in events. If anything I felt like I was being railroaded into being a bloodied build the entire time. 90% of players I jump into teams with are running unyielding+bloodied and just reaming everything with 30 in all their specials lol. Seriously I was praying for a bloodied nerf so I could finally not feel that constant pressure to run the same thing as everyone else. I like being a wild west cowboy with my instigating revolver one shotting everything in sight with VATS crits. Now I won't feel so stupid when I show up to the SBQ at full health lol.
---
I‚Äôve got you!
---
Sob story...?
---
My psn is rustysporks69, add me and I‚Äôll come to you bearing gifts
---
I had a lvl 4 attempt to trade a radaway for 0 caps. I backed out of the trade(bloodied build), shook no, then gave him a thumbs up.
---
This community really is awesome!
---
I've been experimenting with this type of build and yes, it is viable. When it comes to a Bloodied version of it the major weakness is spin up weapons and your inability to stim at a moment's notice. Serendipity and Sentinel gear offers you the best survivability in that circumstance, or using a vampire weapon. A high health build for this is extremely underrated imo, especially if you have a set of AP refresh gear. I have a vampire Gatling Laser with less VATS cost and VATS Crits that I use with this aetup and can effectively Crit spam with it. I'm extremely tanky and can generally handle any situation... Although you'll never solo the SBQ or Earle it's still a very satisfying build to play.
---
Sometimes he's in the roof, sometimes he's under the floor. Hide and seek with Earl is rage inducing when he's alive and when hes dead lmao I'll take Scorchbeast Queen any day but that's just me
---
Looking for calibrated shocks and targeting hud. 
---
As far as Bos mods, Im looking for the shielded suit and power armor paints. Would appreciate it man
---
The best part is they are practicing social distancing than anyone I've seen...
---
On the same boat here... I was even willing to grind for a B/E/25 gauss if it meant same dps as commando build. But after I realized how much dps i was missing out on I made the decision. Got a B fixer off someone today and slapped an automatic receiver on it... Wish every weapon type was near the same power level.
---
I warp through peoples walls if they have locked buildings and I generally just find somewhere and sit and wait for them to return.
---
My pleasure. I would quite literally never use PA if I was forced to have that hud in the way all the time!
---
The perk card would still have its uses even if they removed this, it would be an easy way to get the buffs well fed and well hydrated which aren't getting removed.
---
Public events are exclamation points which offer more rewards, free fast travel, and are a bit tougher. The others are just normal events, less complex, less rewards, and easier.
---
Yeah these look tough man. Can‚Äôt fucking wait. I love a good challenge. Hope this will be like playing Fallout 4 on Very Hard but more exciting
---
Xbox1x.NVRANGER74.always have too much 3 star weapons and armor.i can make you whatever you want.except secret service equipment.add me.üëç
---
As far as Bos mods, Im looking for the shielded suit and power armor paints.
---
Look for scoped teslas and colored bats. That should keep you going for a while
---
This isn't fallout 5, it's a casual online game. They're not going to do anything in terms of consequences beyond a potentially missable cosmetic
---
You could hunt for the mire and blog healing salve recipes.
---
Currently it's possible to destroy things without PA if you have the right weapons.
---
A heavy weapon with the right rolls like a Bloody, Faster fire rate Gatling laser, while inherently powerful, is not "magic" by itself.
---
But with a magic armor piece (reduced damage while blocking) you can make it magic, and it will annihalate everything because the magic damage bug is stronger with strong weapons.
---
I run without PA, and I use several of these weapons, BFFR ultracite Gatling laser, BE LMG, BE minigun even my BE 50 cal becomes magic and can melt things thanks to this single armor piece.
---
And the best part about this, is you get to keep your unyielding bonus, which means more EXP, more AP, melee damage (you can carry a first weapon and sneak attack) etc.
---
I would argue it's optimal to not use PA thanks to the magic damage bug.
---
BUT PA will become better when the magic damage bug is fixed.
---
PRAISE BE!!
---
Eh. All depends on your build and what mutations/enemies you get. 
---
And if you‚Äôre doing it as a team, it‚Äôs probably going to be easy anyway. Solo, it can get hard 
---
I did one as a bloodied stealth melee... I forget the mutation. I think it was camouflage. It was still tough, since I couldn‚Äôt stealth!
---
I did another as junkies unarmed/shotguns (perk swaps). It was robots, freezing touch. It was brutal... I switched to shotguns because trying to close distance was ridiculous.
---
And I had that b!tch in the OP as the final boss. Bruuuutal. I broke like 3 armor pieces during that Op
---
Add Elizabah, I play a few times a week after my daughter is asleep.
---
I could give you some help tmrw. Feel free to message me on Xbox. My GT is ResoluteSpark19. I‚Äôm happy to either lead or follow.
---
16? I can probably load you up on some if rusty hasn't already haha
---
Hi,
---
You said "let alone actually f*****g." so I provided the advertising. I thought that maybe you expected the other poster was speculating, but I remembered having read the article on Bethesda, so I just wanted to provide that to make sure it was clear where that was coming from.
---
I personally like the idea of being able to build up every workshop on the map on a private world, then to be able to take them over when needed without having to build them up every time, or even to be able to keep them indefinitely as settlements.
---
Persistent workshops could be implemented like a saved game in Fallout 4, where settlements remain built as you left them when you save and quit, and over the course of your play, you may build up more and more of the settlements, or in this case, workshops.
---
In fact, I think it would be pretty awesome if you could allow the workshops to be settled just as they were in Fallout 4, where you have to provide beds, food, water, and defense, as well as coming to help defend during attack events.
---
This seems to be the most obvious model they could follow, since it has already been done and coded in this game engine, and at least in my estimation, should work on private worlds, particularly now that Wastelanders has brought Settlers and Raiders that could be used to occupy the workshops. Workshops could still be lost or damaged just as they are now, but you wouldn't have to build from scratch every time you want to use a workshop, and that would make me use workshops more often. Currently, I take over power plants once in a while, but otherwise I find the workshops to be a waste of my time and junk, and they require too much babysitting since CAMP defenses don't actually work, and enemies can spawn inside locked areas anyway. Just yesterday I had a Supermutant spawn inside a locked room on the third floor of my CAMP. It took me several minutes to find him as he shot up my ammo fabricator and broke out the ceiling, because I never thought to look in there. The same thing happens at workshops, so I stopped building defenses and structures. 
---
The saved workshops on private worlds would have to be separate from those on public worlds, just as they are now. Workshops on public worlds could stay just as they are now, but I honestly hope that Bethesda does something to enhance workshops, since it seems that many are disappointed in workshops as they are, and do not use them.
---
The workshops on a private world might have to be those owned by the player who originated the private world server instance, which is to say that friends joining might not be able to see their own workshops. There is probably a way for a group of friends to be able to play where some own some workshops and others own other workshops, but that would probably require a menu where the world owner could choose to show or hide certain workshops, who gets what workshops, or something similar.
---
I believe there can always be a solution if the designers at Bethesda are allowed to do their jobs and are given the resources to do so. They have done some pretty amazing things in these games over the years. I'm a fan of Todd Howard's work going back to Terminator: Future Shock and Skynet, and I see a little bit of those games in the Fallout 3+ games including this one.
---
Also, I did not indicate that there was a release date stated, just as we don't exactly have release dates for instanced CAMP bunkers, BOS DLC, a perk loadout manager, MOD support, and other features that were advertised as coming in the future. I think we all know from experience that even when a release date is given, that is often subject to delay, such as with the ACP event. I would like to know if Bethesda plans to follow through with these features though, because some members might not renew their subscriptions for what they are getting now, since the vast majority of new features and content are free to all players.
---
It is my belief that if Bethesda decides to follow through with the remaining features they mentioned for Fallout First, that they will get a lot of new subscribers. If these features are not important to you, I can understand that. It's okay to accept that different people have different priorities.
---
Cheers, time for a beer.
---
Why can't they eliminate Communism or Zetans?  Who's in charge here?
---
We love you sir!! I myself don't take the game as seriously as some, but I do love it. (Level like 80 something..)
---
To add to the other comment, ones with an exclamation point also give treasury notes (endgame currency after you finish Wastelanders missions). 2 for easy, 3 for medium, 4 for hard iirc
---
Caution still works according to Angry Turtle.
---
I hadn‚Äôt been challenged in a workshop in like a year. I‚Äôm level 330 and last night a level 120 walked up to about 30 feet away crouched down behind a car and started shooting me. So I flipped down my mic and said, ‚Äúyou can stop that or I will crush you.‚Äù
---
He just kept on shooting so I said, ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt crouch behind things that go boom!‚Äù 
---
I shot the car, it exploded and I finished him off with a baseball bat.
---
Damn. I‚Äôm a bloodied heavy build so I think I‚Äôm good. Also have a side of rifleman. I have a BE Gatling plasma and BE Gauss rifle so I‚Äôm def good on weapons. Hopefully I can get a troubleshooter‚Äôs leather armor set since that gives a 75% DR reduction to damage taken from OP robots and leather armor provides the best energy protection.
---
You will not get one for caps. They are going to be a high value trade only item
---
There are a number of things that change depending on your choices. Jen may or may not stick around Foundation, also might rob you, her mom could be alive or dead. If you were mean to Ra-Ra she has some colorful dialogue when you hang around, Lou could be dead, Johnny could be dead, there are some different notes/holotapes...But I do agree overall. 
---
I get that they can‚Äôt make your choices change the entire world in a game like this, but more small touches would go a long way.
---
Do they only drop during select events?
---
Limb damage is magic on a DCG?
---
I know, I hate it. In older games, the recon armor WAS the power armor chassis, and the armor was put on top of that, couldn't they have just designed power armor that way, where you need both to equip it, instead of removing the ENTIRE ventilation/filtration and waste recycling system and replacing it with a FUCKING valve handle with a battery slot? (How the fuck do fusion cores auto swap? They shouldn't, nor should they have to because Power armors whole shtick was having a built in power source.) Now the armor design and functionality makes even less sense. I love how the new design of power armor makes you feel, it's big, powerful, makes you feel unstoppable (despite most PA being shit in the protection category, even outclassed by the right combo of combat marine and robot armor, just cumbersome and a waste of inventory space), but I also love the idea of older Power armor being designed to be able to cling to the user, to fit them as best as possible for maximum mobility, because *That's what's most logical,* you don't **WANT** a person to be so cumbersome that getting them TO the front is as hard as getting a Mk.V Landship in WWI to the front, america was fighting wars of mobility, power armor would need to be tough, as unencumbering as possible, livable with waste recycling and sustained built in power sources, and most importantly, adjustable for all soldiers for maximum operating efficiency.
---
Good one thanks!
---
Or we could just remove all in-game arbitrary time gates.
---
I did this the first queen fight I was at, maybe level 40? Mostly I was excited to just get the award for reviving another player lol.
---
My main is a bloodied HW/Explo build in power armor. He has the easiest time with all Ops. Super tanky, superior damage at range, no dependence on VATS, closing distance, or stealth. The Resiliant mutation is just annoying; have to run up and bash enemies to finish them off
---
Yeah man my nigga here ony posted looking for handouts
---
I got a Junkies, Explosive, 25% VATS cost LMG from my 2nd Earle kill, I also got a Junkies ffr Gauss Minigun from him last week, but in like 100 runs, they're the only notable drops I can think of.
---
I saw a bag that a player left in Whitesprings with a ton of plans in it.  Some of them I didn't know, so I grabbed those, but it was at least 10 of them.  Went over to my stash box, took out every one of my unknown plans (even if they were in my vending machine) and added them all to the same bag.  I just thought that was a good idea.  And I won't miss the 9 caps I would've sold them for.
---
How is he a racist ?
---
A porch pirate is a scummy individual who steals parcels left unattended on peoples porches, it has nothing to do with race.
---
Porch *monkey* now, is a racist term, but not one that op used..
---
You can hire a courier .. I have 2 xboxes, 4 different characters ... if you on a console, you can probably buy a cheap console but depends how desperate you are .. a courier would be less expensive.
---
Never heard of it. But sounds like a new fav!
---
Interesting...
---
Not really. Tonight it wasn‚Äôt nothing good. Got 300 caps from him tho. We did two queens before earl and the one nuke I launched I got a junkies grognak axe 40 power attack +1 strength. Prob best drop I‚Äôve ever had from these two events
---
That‚Äôs great. PA builds are great for heavy weapons but I play as a half-Deathclaw half-man so I gotta have the matching outfit lol. I have level 3 serendipity and reasonably good armor so unless my teammate walks in front of me when I‚Äôm using a BE weapon I don‚Äôt die too much lol
---
That's a nice offer, the owlet is such an incredibly hard to find spawn. The meat can be traded between endless players until it spoils and each will learn the recipe. Here's hoping it gets spread around a lot!

Explosive Telsas don't arc they just shoot explosive rounds. Doesn't affect the game play.
---
Yes I had to leave server after first queen kill tonight it was saying I didn‚Äôt have first and I didn‚Äôt wanna lose my junk. But when I got back into same server it was fixed. I‚Äôm also on Xbox
---
What platform are you on? There is a market place with fairly reliable couriers that help with things like that. You can find the sub in my post history. Sadly can't mention the name here.
---
Apparently so. I'm doing crazy damage with it.
---
Since scouts so fragile bloodied would work Wonders, especially if you find a good bloodied bat
---
*slaps you round the back of the head*
---
Don‚Äôt give them any more ideas, fool!
---
Ah, I see Mumbles has spied another Captain Ishmael fan-boi in the house. I snagged an Assassin's Harpoon and a Junkie's Spear. Too bad we cannot have ships in this game. The two of us can kit one out to hunt Feral Ghoul Whales.
---
We've come full circle that you now have to specify which generation of Wolfenstein and Doom you played new.
---
I concur.
---
Stay at your camp, and smack everyone with a wrench. Better yet just use the laying down photomode pose everywhere.
---
They gave us an ammo converting machine but they *somehow* fucked it up so badly we don‚Äôt want it after all. Leaves a bitter taste in my mouth and camp budget.
---
Just bloody lol
---
For medic, max capacity napalmer with friendly fire
---
Agreed
---
I'm surprised you recommend luck first over intelligence and/or strength. Too many drugs weigh you down quickly in the beginning when you have no strength. I mean 1 stimpak weighs 1lb. You get 30-40 and you start to lose valuable scrap space. Strange choice in my opinion. I'd go Int over Luck personally, level faster. But to each his own.
---
Omg I would love to
---
Would a junkie limb damage powerfist or a furious bash damage 50. Cal be one?
---
Yes
---
I don't think it would appreciate being passed around like a piece of meat
---
You're not allowed to trade here. Head over the to market sub. We can't say it's name here but replace "fallout" in fallout76 with "market" and it'll get you there
---
Just remove limits. Let people who want to grind fucking grind. Everything in this game is time gated. Before gamepass we bought this game, yet they treat it like some freemium phone game.
---
How crazy?
---
I can see what mods I have, I use t-51 primarily too but I have a fairly empty inventory whenever I'm inside so I don't worry about carry weight mods. Gt; Lindbloom826
---
First of all, you‚Äôre just guessing.
---
Second of all, who actually gives a shit?
---
which platform do you play on, and what level are you?
---
Eh i get where your coming from, but of course some builds are better suited for swapping, like heavy guns / melee / shotgun -type high in strength, as opposed to stealth commando with low strength, and what? Pistols in agility? But see, for me I have a bunch of extra perk cards for swapping and hesistant about cashing them in for perk coins, so
---
So, I tried replacing walls tonight on PS4 and it was a no-go. No option to switch wall types plus, just to make it truly 76, there were no images for the various wall variants. Just empty "boxes" when i scrolled up and down in the Replace menu. Good times.

Yes, the dumb will be manipulated by this. The smart will adapt. As someone who likes finishing games on the hardest difficulty, I cant wait (not on pc, or else would be on pts)

Close the game and open it

Btw, your title is wrong but all the same it conveys the message

Yo thank you so much! Will add you now

Thanks so much man! Whats ur psn ill add you

In another thread someone suggested that maybe the BOS would shaft Russell Dorsey at ATLAS so he converts to the Enclave. I can see MODUS instilling him as President. Russell is like one TPS report short of going full Lumbergh.

Was thinking about this the other day. High level player came by and decided they wanted the workshop. It took me a second to realize what was happening. I stared at them for a second and then when I [Contested] I immediately turned and ran as fast as I could... Right into the Grafton Monster
---
BONK! BOINK!

I‚Äôve only ran a silo two or three times solo, so I‚Äôm not an expert, but I can help. My GT is ResoluteSpark19. Feel free to message me.

Think there will be a ranking system within the bos like in fallout 4 like sentinel to knight or whatever. Its be nice if they add some scribe stuff. Not Elder robes, it wouldnt make sense a new guy becomes an elder

It‚Äôs currently happening to me. I moved my camp and now it gets a gray icon. Now Beckett is glitched outside my camp as well. Grrr.

I actually just finished it, it only took 3 deaths and 800 50 cal shots. But I did it finally. Though thanks for the offer

No and why would he
---
My plans are cheap. 15 caps a piece. XBox One, Sithlord73
---
Damn if only you're on xbox. That's awesome of you to do
---
Because I thought everything was suppose to scale up in One Wasteland? Like the turrets I believe are getting buffed
---
I take your side for one reason. Look at new vegas. Today, most forget that for a good year after release "Fallout; New Vegas, has stopped working" was the only quest you could play, and it's the practical √úbermensch if fallout games for most.
---
Someone should inform every faction in the wasteland then that they should stop making the new guy their leader.
---
I would like this especially since Im a pistol user myself.
---
I am trying to get this rocket attachment on my shovel.  Still have some kinks to work out.
---
Let me check my mule, have the shocks and HUD for sure. BOS is a maybe
---
It probably does damage scaled to your weapon
---
For heavy I'm gonna a make my guy bald and stuff and I do happen to have plans for the grinder.
---
For soldier I was hoping to find a vampires rocket launcher and add triple barrel for the black box.
---
Demo I do happen to have a Grenade Launcher so I can use that. All I need is an eyepatch.
---
Spy I can possibly do.
---
Scout is a possible maybe if I can get a sawed off shotgun for Force-A-Nature.
---
Sniper would be a good one since I've seen a ton of sniper builds lately.
---
I honestly could do this for all my nee characters, cause right now my main character is a self preservation, passively heal, and self revive field medic. I have healing hands as an extra perk to mess up bloodied builds during events, to show them being a bloodied build isnt the meta. I've already messed up and got about 5 bloodied builds mad at me during a SBQ event I did tonight. They had to retreat to the bunker and it made me laugh so hard. Healing hands is best against bloodied builds.
---
Laughs in Witcher 2
---
Oh shoot that's right. Sorry about that.
---
I would love this. I would be happy to hold on to vouchers and not have to worry about what I can and cannot hold.
---
Oh god yes lol. And I'll have a backpack and an syringer lol
---
Nice! Congrats! If you didn‚Äôt this time, I do know that having level 3 hacking and lock picking can save you a lot of time by bypassing some areas.
---
Works with cooked food and is a great effect.
---
Oh darn, was hoping you were on PC.
---
Another gamer Dad here... 2, 11 and 15 yr old
---
Good idea because it keeps us on daily like they want with the limit unchanged, but without all the weapon piles that keep us offline for more than 2 hrs.
---
1 hour gameplay a day, good luck üòÇ and of course loading screens don't pause the timer and every legendary drop you get removes 10 minutes from the timer, including those from purveyor. Bethesda, hire me right now
---
*loads BE laser with malicious intent*
---
Don‚Äôt you dare.
---
Idk about that. That is weird and probably a bug, only times I see a lot of spawns is for a herd like I said. I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else has ever had this happen
---
I'm pretty sure deathclaw doesn't get magic damage.
---
I posted there but it locked my post. I'm really new to reddit.
---
Ward needs a Wasteland Doctor to examine him. Either "Finally, someone with the guts to help" is his credo, or he has a short-term memory issue. We keep coming back every day and he acts like it's the first time he met us.
---
I agree, brain fungus soup+cranberry cobbler means easy repeatable xp score. Also plants have a lot of great buffs
---
Melee
---
Aye aye capn. I got a ghoul slayer broadsiders. We are well prepared.  Just need a legendary pole hook
---
He wasn‚Äôt there that early, no. I was assuming you hadn‚Äôt been back since you turned in the last quest.
---
He‚Äôs in the office upstairs. Also, lock pick the safe up there (level 2) for lore about Duchess.
---
Did you read what the bot said. There is a specific way you have to format your title. It tells you how to do it
---
Started playing only recently, and I think it‚Äôs incredible how often Bethesda responds here to suggestions. Dunno what the game was like 2 years ago, but the quests still have the same meaning as other Fallouts. I just wish the paid content had their own lore.
---
Im building a melee and wanted a hand cannon as a ranged weapon for back up use
---
‚ÄúBut whatever‚Äù 
---
Don‚Äôt be pissy about it. Your way is just as convoluted as any previous way. You even admitted it didn‚Äôt work with a certain wall, but with another. That‚Äôs convoluted and it‚Äôs ridiculous to defend.
---
No, they just need to remove the scrip limit.

Thank god, then i can go afk in my camp all day

Will a bloodied level 45 handmade with commando and most of the works (sneak included)  still be viable?
---
Hmm, did you use brick door walls? It worked for me, like 4months ago
---
Melee/unarmed weapons are not 'magic' because the attack rate is too slow.
---
50cal fire rate is to slow for it to be magic. Has to be above 200 fire rate or an lmg with the right effects.

I have heard of people with less than 200 but have it still

True, they will likely just keep adding smaller expansions like quests, or events that change a small area.
---
Hi buddy, another single dad here.. unfortunately you're on Xbox or I'd be over in a shot with a full set of Unyielding and a vampires .50 cal, with enough ammo to take down Todd himself... Fallout 76 has saved this year for me, My child is weekly shared so I get more time to loose myself in it for a week and night time's the when I have her..keep up the grind brotha üíï
---
Yes, also a problem on PC so I have started using the number keys to select my items. Still prefer the original wheel tho‚Äô.
---
But no matter what you do Fisher... GD Fisher why did you make me do it
---
It's considered an Atom Shop item once unlocked, so you can't get plans for it, and other players can't build it for you.
---
Gotta keep myself amused somehow ü§∑
---
No idea, but if you're like me, just go see Mumbles on any day that ends with "-day". You're sure to have all the nautical-themed weaponry you could ever want.
---
In all seriousness, I don't think I've ever seen what you're looking for. But, I also don't pay attention once I see it is a Harpoon/Broadsider/Spear. Was this a two-shot with an explosive effect or an Explosive prefix?
---
Did someone say ...Scranton Strangler?
---
I disagree, I love the animation. I think it's so unique and it makes power armor something that feel way more tanky
---
The easiest, but expensive way is FO1st, I am constantly transferring legendaries from my main character to the other 3 to scrip.

53 years old.  Been playing this game since Beta.  Completely jealous of your lunchbox!

Wow...

I think that is the quest reward for killing a wendigo while wearing a clown suit.

This isn‚Äôt a trading subreddit
---
To the left of the cleftal horizon.
---
Are you using it in vats and what kind of numbers are you getting?
---
Pretty sure you can bash with it and make it work again.
---
You could always offer them for free. Even though the chances are that someone just buys them to then sell, it's not guaranteed to destroy them. 
---
Also, willing to bet if you sell near V76 for cheap, you will probably get some new players buying.
---
I know the struggle.  Not so much the kids part, but life keeping you down.  No time to grind the god tier weapons, no time to grind the rep, and no time to get even close on the legendary run.  But none of that matters.  You're having fun, and enjoying the atmosphere.  From a small shack in the middle of nowhere with a single nuka cola to the whitesping golf course, to the joy of a camp punch bowl with nukashine, Appalachia is your garden, and you are digging it.
---
Yeah, and the daily opts, very hard to sneak all the way than before. I still think ballistic fiber is a expensive resource.
---
üëç‚ò∫
---
Stuff like this makes me want to do the same at higher levels. Haven‚Äôt had anyone try and trade with me though, since I started playing the game a couple days ago. Just one person who bought some shotgun shells.
---
i have all of them yet it won‚Äôt let me turn them in, anyone else have this issue?
---
Aw man. Well thank you anyways!
---
Also a 9mm,.45 acp and 12.7 pistols.

Melee to conserve ammo and cook meat/plants to sell at vendors, make sure to maximize your charisma as much as you can before selling

Hell yeah. SBq doesn‚Äôt have a time limit to loot her corpse
---
HotCheeseOwO is my tag. I'll mosey around with you sometime.
---
I mean, if something was in fact harmful or dangerous, excuse are the last thing you should be making.
---
We got the service rifle?
---
Coo thanks!
---
All of my melee weapons are shit cause I focused on a rifle build
---
I believe in one of the upcoming patches, some of the rewards can be purchased from a vendor, so you may have a chance to buy one soon.
---
I can say the second I gave away was utilized by three to four players as they all stuck around my camp for a while and took turns learning the recipe.
---
First guy bailed pretty quick (after all these do spoil over time), but did buy 10k ammo out of vendor as a thanks, so that was nice.
---
I have no idea of the math involved on the backend, but that's a 2% ROI. Probably spot on for the crazy RNG algorithms in this game. My best roll of 1000 scrip was a Junkie's Gauss Pistol, which is odd because I don't know the plan. Plus, I cannot sell it in my vendor because of course I can't.
---
haha vampire gatling plasma goes brrrrrrr
---
They honestly could with the amount of spooky shit coming out of WV
---
If u ever cross over to ps4 i got u!
---
Yes. You will use 1 to 3 more bullets, depending on the enemy. That's it.
---
Cranberry bog and Ash head treasure maps. And distant thunder. Those are your options for finding them
---
What level are you?
---
Fuck uhhhhh like 53
---
Nice, because ammo factory makes up for this
---
All the bloodied douche bags that one shot legendary enemies at events has created ill will towards the build.
---
If you stick around forest region and melee as much as you can, you should be alright until you can gather some caps. What platform are you one?
---
You mean to make it or to mod it? Don't bother trying to make it, just scour power armor spawns until you have a full set, takes like 30 minutes, much quicker than grinding for the plans.
---
To mod your armor, hit up Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga.
---
PS4
---
Oh really! Awesome I‚Äôll make sure to get it for next time.
---
Yeah, that's pretty much the idea. Also contextual ammo from Daily Ops. 
---
Still, this all needs another balance pass.
---
Why would anyone complain about this then?
---
Ahhh I remember when we used to have to do challenges on Suvival server for a weapon..... One was take a pic at a church.. Pvpers loved camping at them for easy aid XD
---
I've been living off a massive cache of repair kits from SBQ kills. I haven't manually repaired in months.
---
It massively helps. I have a full health Junkies Unarmed Tank build I made specifically for fighting the Imposter. There's a VERY noticable difference in the fight if I'm in my normal armor vs my Troubleshooter set.
---
i‚Äôm yeeting tf away from that if i ever came across that nope nope nope
---
As I understand, Piercing Gaze is on all OPS, and Resilient makes enemies only die to melee meaning you can Gun bash the last 1 HP.
---
Same.
---
Ah. The inside the vault was misleading
---
Good point, and worded wrong. Thanks for that.
---
Not to mention it would help a lot with server lag. Its easier for them to keep track of stacks of items. But when it has to keep track of stats, legendary traits, weapon condition and mods it tends to slow things down a bit.
---
There's a few pre-requisites for what I regularly do but I'll just list it:  
---
Lead: Lucky hole has tons of ore that you can mine. If you wear an Excavator PA, you can usually get 300+ ore a run
---
Steel: I generally farm mole miners at blackwater mine and use the "scrapper" to get a lot more steel from their weapons(shotguns, AR's, missile launchers, and gauntlets)
---
Gunpowder: Farming super mutants at West Tek is decent, gives some steel and plastic too. Or just farm acid, cloth shouldn't be difficult to get
---
Acid: Tanagra town, Campfire tales, or Dolly Sods. They all are a pretty good source of acid
---
Caps: Events, dailies, or such. Super mutants at West Tek drop a bit. Or another option is(again), farm mole miners and blackwater mine. Good thing here is that the whitesprings station is right next to it so you can farm a bit and then just crawl right down the hill and sell everything off
---
It works with LMGs. I have a bloodied limb damage and a junkies faster fire rate. Bugged effects with two shot or on gauss miniguns also work because of the multiple damage procs.
---
This is just my understanding, and I may be wrong. I play on Xbox so I don't have hands on but I do watch this sub very closely.
---
You are correct in both things you said
---
Holy shit thanks dude
---
Could be hard drive performance; does the frame rate go up if she stands still in one place? Otherwise, can you confirm that her system is actually using the Geforce card to render and not the onboard graphics chip? Are there any Windows updates happening in the background? Can you check task manager to see if her hard drive is under heavy load while she's playing? Lastly, how's her virtual memory, is it set to system managed or a specific value?
---
Thank you for adding possible confirmation.
---
They were thinking people should have to fight over resources they don't have to actively farm. You should stash your stuff as soon as you loot the extractors and stay crouched while in the workshop. If you get killed with a ton of junk in a workshop because you just sit visible in it then it's your own fault. Make yourself a harder target to hit.
---
Dense should still work for explosions, so Volatile shouldn't bother my melee build.
---
There's alos the option to grow some melons at your camp. Raw provides both water and food
---
I had a duo of lvl 30s looked new to the game and that gave me a few radaways to get rid of my rads.
---
Agreed its never a fight its always sniper shot out of no where I'm dead. Lvl 215 full set of ss armor as well. If I had a chance to actually fight maybe but how do they one shot me?
---
The only times I personally used it was when I was in a team with lower level toons. I figure some rad healing would be helpful to a level 20. If I'm running with grizzled vets, I share Strange In Numbers.
---
That reminds me, I need to craft a low-level pistol for things like Uranium Fever. At least until they fix Teslas.
---
Hey! If you want a recommendation on a sniper build, I have one handy! I started as a sniper then got lured in by power armour and Gatling guns/machine guns. 
---
My husband and I got a friend into the game who is also doing a sniper build, so we have all the perk card recommendations prepped, just shoot me a PM if you‚Äôre interested, and good luck!
---
  I was doing the workshop event because I needed 1 more for the weekly or daily I cant remember. Then all of a sudden mid wave as I was killin mole rats when some guy challenged my workshop and killed me. Still not sure how it was possible since I didn't think it could be done during a defense. 
---
  Personally they need to just get rid of the Pvp element an put into Survival or leave it to just NW.  Fresh level 50 vs a lvl 333, not like I was going to take that bet anyways, but come on//
---
Because it's a change, and the numbers are smaller.

Make sure you have the after nuke drop one. You can grab it from a silo in the little holotape holder. If not check the wiki and compare what you have vs the list you might be surprised to find one you missed
---
A little.  Planning on rolling up a second character to see how the game is with the One Wasteland experience.  My main is a Sneak Commando, so I think this one is going to be Heavy Weapons PA.
---
Add BigBrooker5 on xbox im level 134 and have lots of gear that could help you

Is it like an unmarked quest because I‚Äôve asked her about it twice and nothings ever popped up
---
Piercing Gaze is permanently active on PTS; there's always 2 mutations, and one is always Piercing Gaze.
---
Unknown if that's intended to be the permanent, Live variation, or if we'll start getting 2 randomized mutations. I'm guessing it's permanent- Bethesda can't balance around Stealth, so they dump it entirely.
---
Basically as soon as the Op starts, stealth is voided- every enemy knows where you are for the entire Op.
---
Volatile must be new; haven't seen it in action on the PTS.
---
Active Camouflage is truly active. It's like a StealthBoy that reactivates after a second or two. So it's not like they start stealthed, attack, and permanently destealth, no.... they restealth very fast after attacking. Makes VATS almost totally useless.
---
Resilient is anti-ranged, sort of. Can't go below 1hp from anything other than melee damage; have to drop them low then gunbash them if ranged build (haven't tested throwing weapons; assume they don't count as melee)
---
Freezing Touch basically gives every ranged attacker a Cryolator effect on their normal attack. Let me tell you, a horde of Colonel Gutsies with Freezing Touch is bruuuutal as a melee build. I don't notice it as power armor, although it probably burns cores- my PA build is Bloodied, so he demolishes them before they have a chance to do much.
---
real shit?
---
I‚Äôd recommend being about Lv. 50+ with GOOD guns and LOTS OF BULLETS. 
---
Ol‚Äô boy Earle is a sponge worse than the Queen.

To combat an exploit, Beth recently took down the ability to swap Walls/Windows/Doors. (About a month ago, I think.) But, I *thought* it was "fixed". I may have misunderstood though. Perhaps the fix is coming next week. Also, it could be I did not worship properly at the Shrine of Todd and am being punished.
---
Only way to get one shot is if you are running low health. Damage is capped at 110 per shot.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I built a new camp just yesterday. It works with the brick doorway. Place them back to back, aim at one hit square then triangle to change it. Select wall and repeat. Then you can wallpaper both sides
---
Maybe they were just trying to say they think you're the bomb!
---
You go to side tab on your mission journal on your pipboi and you will see an ally quest which you need to set to marked to actually see the location of your objective on the map
---
Oh wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. Sorry for your loss. May she rest in peace.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, I might have them. Will double check.
---
Except that's what always happens, I don't run bloodied either.
---
What if they wouldn't take the stuff?üòÇ
---
There's several! I dual client with a cheap second account I got a long time ago. In my mind, it's vastly superior to FO1st, for the one-time cost of about 2 months of 1st. But you do need the hardware to be able to dual client; either multiple machines or a good PC.
---
Collect acid wherever you can - flag it to make sure you can get it a lot.  Kill critters that drop it whenever you can.  Clear out Lucky Hole Mine and collect as much ore with Excavator Power Armor as you can.  You'll wind up with a ton of lead once you smelt all that the ore.
---
If you don't have the Scrapper perk, get it.  Farm Super Mutants and Scorched (Automatic Rifles especially) for the steel.  You'll be able to make lots of ammo doing both these things
---
There are several places that have lead weights as well, learn those locations and loot them whenever you can.  Always pick up Rat Poison, Wooden Blocks, Pencils, and all toys and cans - those all have lead in them.
---
Also, the ammo converter is a pain to use, but I've had good luck generating a lot of .50 cal ammo for my Heavy PA build.  Any time I get other ammo types I can't use in quantities of 200+, I dump them into the converter whenever I visit my camp and use the points to keep me in enough ammo to where I rarely am concerned about running out.
---
  Id love to see the script machine increased to something other then 150 since I seem to get a lot of useless legendary and I dont have the stash to use the majority of them..
---
TheChemosabe on Xbox add me and if I see your on I can give you some good stuff or upgrade your gear for you
---
What if you have two shots or bean splitter or such ? Or the vats mode shotgun damage glitch ?
---
Just missing one last piece for a full set so I'll just keep farming spawns. Thanks for the tip
---
And now we ain‚Äôt getting what we were promised. Almost a year in and we *still* don‚Äôt have *half* of what was promised. We were promised a larger camp budget in private worlds. We do not have this. We were promised persistent workshops in private worlds. We do not have this. We were promised exclusive items and discounts. We haven‚Äôt had many of those. Hell, we *still* don‚Äôt have basic skins for our scrapboxes! Bethesda are worse than EA in that respect - at least they give you what you pay for.
---
You are probably getting hit two or three times before you get a chance to react. I can shoot someone with a bloodied gauss that does 1,000+ damage and they only take 110 each time, that is the reason people like fast fire rate weapons in PvP.
---
Ahh, gotcha.  Well it does have it's faults but I certainly enjoy playing it.  I think it's a lot more fun that people sometimes give it credit for.
---
Both. My main has it. Look at any food and you'll see a % or 0% along with any buffs that apply or don't. If it has various benefits but is meat based it will all be 0. You can at least attempt to sell it at your CAMP or at a vendor.
---
Would have to be pretty fast then. It's happened twice in the last month
---
What's the name of the under armor ? I haven't unlocked it yet. I wanna look it up
---
Short answer: they can't
---
Long answer: Bethesda has slowly but steadily tackled hacking as it's come up. They don't talk about it, I guess for security reasons, but each patch has a little bit more improved anti-cheats in it. *But*...although new hacking exploits are getting more rare, whatever hacked objects are already in the game...are probably going stick around. It's pretty obvious that if Bethesda had the means to remove the 50cals that shoot mininukes and whatnot, they'd have already done it.
---
Does the Piercing Gaze negate all sneak perks? If so I‚Äôll just swap them out for more useful ones in Daily Ops. Does it also remove sneak bonuses from things like Sandman and Covert Ops?
---
Vats rarely works in PvP for shotguns. Beam splitter and two shot don't make a difference. You can get magic damage to work but it takes multiple shots so it rarely makes a difference.
---
I am so sorry you gotta deal with these people, everyone is incredibly uneducated when it comes to pvp. And all of these people are trashing on you just because they are bad at pvp (not putting in the time or effort to actually figure it out) and salty they got "griefed" at a workshop. I get that pvpers can be toxic but you have been being cordial and people just get so triggered, its actually impressive. 
---
Note to casuals: Who claims a fucking workshop for materials?? You get jack squat from workshops go farm elsewhere its much faster.
---
Take grafton workshop and run the steel and lead extractors and then clear out the steel mill and take all the gunpowder, ammo and guns off all the super mutants. Should be able to make ammo. Also find the best melee weapon you can even for your build to use when you run out and are rebuilding.
---
Xbox sadly. :/
---
This. Just tap bash and reload.
---
Power armor was worth having in Fallout 3 and NV.  But here and even in Fallout 4, I barely use it.  I'd probably use it more here if I wasn't immediately over-encumbered when I put it on.  I only use it for the Encrypid event and the Excavator for mining lead.
---
I can help you out if your on now. Let me know if your on.
---
Man there‚Äôs so much to do thanks everybody
---
TIL  I can't believe I never knew that.
---
... you‚Äôre always detected by all enemies. So yes, no sneak perks work
---
Got a bloodied, limb damage, agility minigun from him on 2nd try, 1st try was the mining helmet and cursed harpoon.
---
From what I've noticed, you get decent loot drops from him.
---

Secret service under armour, with a shielded mod
---
Thanks, I play pacifist mode and I wouldn't know. But it's true that contesting workshop is annoying. I'm level 300 and also got shot like a rabbit few months ago while farming nuclear material by some god mode pvp expert. He killed me like 10 times-zero.
---
Add Hemlock Holes Maintenance for Acid, 3 spots in the 1 workshop helps build it up nicely
---
I've seen radstags, yao gai, toads, mirelurks spawn en mass in that spot.
---
Scrip the heaviest stuff you don't want first. The light stuff save as a sort of "scrip bank" to fill in days when you don't feel like or didn't do a lot of farming
---
I'm vendoring anything less than a 3-star and my stash is still constantly full
---
I switch that off every time I enter the store. Awful elevator music. Sorry. 
---
The Atom shop music on the other hand...
---
Anyone else think that the assaultron intimidator is sexy?
---
Could have been an alt or mule, and not a ‚Äúnew‚Äù player.
---
Hoping it stacks with Ammo Smith.
---
The fusion core drains so fast and auto cycles for game play purposes, not lore.
---
Sweet! Time to blast this music using area mic when doing covert ops!
---
Ok thanks a lot but should I still try and sell it?
---
Haha did you repeatedly attempt to give them stuff? Maybe they were trying to emphasize no.
---
I run 4 characters and the lowest is lv 32. On that one sometimes people try to give stuff i dont need and occasionally, don't seem to understand why I don't want the stuff. 
---
Then I end up getting followed and given "help" with high lv mobs as I'm trying to farm haha, since im usually trying to get xp by hopping for lv 68 mutants at Huntersville and west tek
---
Sorry, can‚Äôt hear you soyboys over my mouth full of meat
---
Nah atomic shop music isn‚Äôt as good
---
Don‚Äôt
---
Nope. Energy damage explosions completely ignore Explosion resist. Fireproof and Dense torso do not provide any protection.
---
This
---
I wish it gave you the full benefit of the Aquaboy/Aquagirl perk.  It's not much to ask and it wouldn't make it OP or anything.  Most people would still hate it.  But only having the breathing underwater advantage is lame.
---
I just dropped a few right there on ground cuz I was maxed out on everything
---
No i only tried to give it to them twice, but i suppose that would make sense!
---
I didn't think of that. I should have, lol I run two players one is a bloodied melee and a then the other is a sniper buildüòÇ
---
Scrapping legendaries could work for setting up a legendary crafting system.  Scrapping a bloodied melee weapon or ranged weapon has a chance of providing the plan for adding or replacing the bloodied effect to ranged weapons.  Relying on RNG or player vendors to get the legendary equipment you want is far too annoying.  Of course, it would reduce the amount of business that the Rusty Pick will receive, but it is a necessary sacrifice.
---
no....
---
Screaming Eagle skin.
---
Shucks, I‚Äôm on XB1 and would have given you some melee weapons
---
The reason it was hated was because it was advertised as a repeatable raid, which it is not at all.
---
Unless they have desirable rolls, which is a really big topic but bloodied, junkies, explosive, unyielding and anti armor stuff often sell easier than everything else, especially in player vendors.
---
For stuff that aren't that useful, it's doubtful anyone will buy during this weekend. Everyone has the same scrip discount weekend that you do.
---
Ok thanks a ton.
---
True, I prefer the extra xp from cooking them plus the fungus+cobbler
---
You get 5 frames? Holy Brahmin! Wish I got 5 frames.
---
Laziness
---
The only places I can think of is The Deep and Grafton Lake.  Those are the only spots I'll pop Aquaboy on and that's only for a minute or so.  Edit: Oh and Blackwater Mine.
---
I kept thinking they just liked playing in super hardcore mode üòÇ
---
You mean selling to NPC bots? Depends on the weapon. A 3\* rolling pin is worth more in scrip (40) than it is in caps. Whereas a 1\* Hunter's Gatling Plasma will only scrip for 5, but a bot vendor will pay a decent amount of caps for it. It's all about weighing up which option gives you the most value.
---
If you mean selling in your player vendor, only do this if it's a mid-high tier roll. Otherwise it'll just sit taking up stash space forever and nobody will buy it.
---
Excellent idea
---
What system are you on? I can give you the fixer plans for free.
---
Still a jerk move on their part! Sorry that happened
---
This helps a lot too.
---
Oh no that's harsh.
---
I use ffr handmade in pvp and ppl claim i "1shot" them all the time.. yet im confident ive never 1 shot a full health build ever. 
---
The game isn't exactly silky smooth so I can see how getting killed fast might seem like getting 1 shot but it's not happening.
---
I recognize that.  
---
I sell almost all my plans for 0 caps. Some rarer ones at about 90% discount. I do this rather than throwing them away.  
---
Every once in a while there is someone that runs by my vendor and takes all the free plans.   
---
If it is a low level player, that's just fine. That's who the plans are there for.  
---
But if it is a level 150+ that just puts them up for sale himself later on... Well it happens, and i guess it says something about that person. And i guess it says something about mee too, either that i'm just plain stupid that don't stop giving stuff away since the wrong people might take it. Or something else...
---
Hey man depending on what your schedule is I can hop on and maybe help you out with things. My partner also plays so if we‚Äôre lucky he might join us.
---
That happened to me the day update 21 went live but after a while it went back to normal, I think it was bc of my Internet.
---
They removed the whole karma aspect in Fallout 4 too.  So this is just an extension of that.  I do miss when Fallout felt more like a real RPG.
---
I killed a level 15 in gorge junkyard the other day and he dropped some screws and steel. What a nice lad
---
You don't solo an endgame boss in most other games. Especially on an MMO. This game is so messed up people are coming up with distorted standards. This must stop. I really hope Bethesda fix this with upcoming adjustments. You can still solo bosses tho. Just needs more effort and time
---
Use a friend or courier. Leaving stuff in a container is asking for trouble....
---
i have 17 of them, i‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs all of them?
---
The new score soundtrack is stunning
---
This is just saddening
---
The bitch of it is you generally have to have one to get one. Most people are trade only, mostly ask for other legacies for the trade . The subreddit that shall not be named is the only real chance to get one, or other trustworthy trading site.
---
Actually I'm against more currencys specially intermediate ones like the one for gold. It becomes pointless once you get a steady supply. 
---
I'm much rather give it away at a heavy discounted rate after the normal limit than have another number to keep track. 
---
But that just me... I think there are more elegant solutions like having a weekly instead of daily limit. 
---
Or heavy discount after the limit.
---
Yeah everyone fell in love with the broken damage now they don't want to leave it
---
Talk to the overseer and talk to her about the tapes and one other choice should complete the overseers mission quest. If it‚Äôs not completing I would try and report it to Bethesda
---
No. Did you?
---
Hey! Would I be able to purchase one of these from you on ps4? üòä
---
yeah, i tell her about it and my only option states ‚Äúi haven‚Äôt found all of them yet‚Äù i may put a ticket in, just wanted it during the sale though.
---
Usually with one click my faster fire rate handmade will shoot 2 rounds so it's pretty fast.
---
Also, since herbivore is a mutation, strange in numbers magnifies the effects even further. Brain fungus soup gives me 5 intelligence
---
That's a bit crazy though, as a lobby of me at lvl 162 and my friends all ranging from 150 to 269 couldn't take out a acp in the time limit set.
---
Honestly when I'm taking down a legendary scorchbeast and that track starts playing! Perfection.
---
I used to dislike PvP but after so many hours in game it was something new to learn and get better at. People are definitely the most challenging enemy in game if they are skilled. The most you lose is 50 caps if you make sure to stash all your junk. PvP has a pretty steep learning curve for the average player which is unfortunate because I think more people would enjoy it.
---
Hey man. Just launched a nuke and some methhead one tabbed Earl and I couldn't even tag it. My face is still red
---
PC uwu

Got a BE 90 fixer from the event, while my wife got an AA E 15R minigun.

That‚Äôs captain jack sparrow to you sir
---
Trading is not allowed here.
---
This may be a different topic, but it's a related question.  How much are you willing to spend per scrip?  
---
They are already sitting in my stash until I scrip them anyway, so I figure I may as well try to see if they will sell.  And they are always the first to go when I scrip.  In the meantime, perhaps someone may come along that think they a great deal.  While someone may be looking for something to buy cheap and turn into scrip.
---
For junk legendaries, I tend to price those in my vendor for 10 caps per scrip (400 caps for 3-star weapons and 240 for 3-star armor).  I'm just wondering if 10 caps per scrip is too little/too much.   Thanks in advance for any feedback.
---
Why
---
I‚Äôm on PC
---
Id love a quest or event where you collect tapes containing different wv ghost stories similar to those in Coffin Hollow or Telltale Lilac Bush (two amazing ghost story books for anyone looking for some Halloween reading)
---
Jeff Fahey Good. Hit me up if I'm online.
---
Your name is actually shotgun?
---
Happy cake day, fellow vault dweller!
---
Too bad this never stops the griefers. I like to take workshops and build massive bases for fun. Then some person about 400 levels higher than me just snipes me over and over and I have to jump servers.
---
Eh.  The DJ ruins it
---
Because its not a trading sub. It would be extremely cluttered with trades if it was. This sub is for discussing fallout76.
---
Go to R. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 but without the periods for trading

Xbox /:
---
If you have scrapper equipped you are easily looking at 10-15 steel per weapon. I routinely clear over a 1000 steel very easy from a glitched event
---
You don‚Äôt need to give me anything. I‚Äôll help you out for free - BlackClock69#660.
---
I know its not convinient in anyway, but i love being "vulnerable" while naked and step into my 100% badass powerarmor and destroy all my enemies. My iron man fantasies come true.
---
LOL, I still haven't gotten this, and I'm  level 150+. I'm stubborn in online games and want to do it naturally(not set up friends kill/revive situation).  I'm so busy with the fights, I miss the calls for help until someone gets there first/or I'm being attacked by an add, etc.
---
That is also a true statement
---
That wasn‚Äôt even op that replied to you, just some loser who wanted to try and steal some free plans
---
lol you ok kid? what a sad little fucker
---
This is why a damage nerf is coming. 
---
https://youtu.be/lirdZgEaTUA
---
Omg I didn‚Äôt even notice! He got me lmao
---
I always thought it was 20%, or maybe that's just the unyielding armor. Don't quote me though.
---
Always check for the blue name and little symbol if someone tries to reply to you for free stuff like that
---
I‚Äôve had that happen twice. I always try to leave a little something nice at each camp, and help folks out all the time so maybe it was a random act of karma? Today was the second time. I was having a rough day too so having some random player drop 100 Xmas boxes in my camp literally restored my waning faith in humans to be altruistic. This game has got me through a brutal 2020 so far. Thats already a lot. See ya on the wasteland. And ty for being awesome.
---
not sure if you should trust this guy, seems kinda shady.
---
Yeah that's what I've had it on but I just wonder if I am doing that for no reason.
---
Stash is full... reached my script and cap limit for the day... fuck it ill just drop these here... (dumps 5 random legendaries infront of the scrip machine.).. we should atleast be able to scrap them for vault steel.
---
Thanks!!
---
With resilient, only the final blow has to be melee (or bash), so you can still take them down to 1hp with ranged weapons.
---
Just under 5% health would yield 95% more damage
---
Thanks :)
---
Oh ok so it's 1:1 Health percentage to damge percentage?
---
No, increments of 5
---
Interesting, thanks.
---
Ah ok. Still that's alot simpler math than I thought it would be lol. Thanks so much for the reply!
---
Sure.. but they arnt going to do that, they need people to buy Atoms.. gotta pay for stuff some how
---
Yup
---
I use it and would not be without it
---
Not sure what the camp infinite limit is, but you do get a scrapbox that gives unlimited junk storage, but you do not get unlimited camp space. 
---
And if you stop your subscription your junk stays in the box for you to use/keep but you can‚Äôt add to it.
---
Blah blah, Todd's dick, blah. We all suck it. Please stop with these posts.
---
Wanna play?
---
On a real note. Would you like to sell a fixer plan?
---
Telling the truth, are we? You can‚Äôt do that around here. Sorry.
---
Mods for PC that let you type in for sliders instead of using the slider itself so it's possible
---
PS4.  I kinda will take a break tbh.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened.
---
So what's it feel like to be so wrong?  So incredibly, horribly wrong?  To have an opinion that is so off base people question your sanity?
---
;)
---
It's just a single week break. As long as they pump seasons every 2 or three months, I'm fine
---
It happens.  I have FO1st and should have planned this better and in advanced.  Cause my 2nd character is a Bloodied Rifleman build with a slight bit of sneak.  So the Fixer would have been a valiant effort.
---
I was beyond confused like are you seriously unable to find radaway like I've got 20 you can have some.
---
The explained it and I still thought they were crazy till i saw the damage they could do
---
Some people go as low as 5\~10 % but think that's being too extreme. You do get slight damage bonus for going below 20% but I really don't think it's worth the risk
---
Simmer down there edgelord
---
The fact that it's for gameplay is obvious, if illogical, I simply don't see why they had to change the four game and over ten year old lore for no apparent reason.
---
Yeah I certainly think I will keep it around there. Except for maybe the queen where I can sit on the concrete building and be pretty safe for the most part from the waves of minions
---
Sounds so much better than I imagined
---
Seems like that would have no benefit for Bethesda or the in game market. Having daily/weekly challenges for something other than SCORE would just devalue Seasons in general which was kind of their successful redemption (besides autocomplete bug). As u/yonggo said, it‚Äôs just one week.
---
The faster you twats come to terms the better it'll be.
---
I played beta and day one and I barely notice the bugs going down it always seems like there is more bugs than fixes it‚Äôs got me questioning if they even know which game they are working on
---
Same here. If it's not "set a camp down" or "survive for 10 minutes" I skip it. Can't use a stimpack if my amateur ass can't live long enough to find one.
---
I seem to remember a demo of the original Wolfenstein coming on a disc in computer gaming world a long time ago. The last guy in the demo had a mini gun and said something like 'guten tag!' when you met him. And then he started shooting you.
---
For each star on a legendary you get a legendary scrap. So a three star would give you 3 legendary scrap. 10 scrap to craft into a module. Easy peezy.
---
I understand it's just 1 week, but it could be an annual event between seasons. They should also raise the turn in limit that week to flush out some of the garbage people hold on to for scrip.
---
Yeah they lied about a lot of things and them bringing back some free currency that they promised to keep in the game is highly unlikely and basically impossible because come on it‚Äôs Bethesda
---
If we are asking for stuff, ask for the cap to be removed. It‚Äôs stupid to have a cap on how much you can hold when there is already a cap on how much you can earn in a day.
---
I liked the division.... Though it got a lil crazy with the bullet sponges...
---
Sorry yes, meant the scrapbox unlimited junk storage.  Not the CAMP itself.
---
What makes such a big difference for you?
---
Baby steps
---
Ever on ps4..hit me up,ill give u my user id..we'll have tons of fun
---
3% is the last cap, but people will play with 19,9% since they have more buffer and unyielding grants it maximum benefit.
---
True; nice writeup, btw.  I just wish they wrote it up more tightly.
---
Why did you get two down votes?
---
I‚Äôve gotten terrible drops all I‚Äôve gotten is the rug and the plushie and about 20+ ‚Äúcursed‚Äù weapons and no good legendary‚Äôs imo it‚Äôs not worth the nuke for me
---
If y'all wanna make this a night hunt, I'll bring my nocturnal pole hook.
---
Rule 6...
---
I imagine every bloodied build is just a sassy tsundere who doesn't want you to heal them. *Angry tsundere noises*Th- thanks for the heals, idiot!
---
They act all generous offering people free ammo and stuff but I prefer a server that don't lag. I block and report them as often as I can. Hope they get banned. Well not banned since it ain't that much of an exploit but some timeouts or a warning would be nice
---
Would prefer if these were sprinkled in with  normal packs making it tricky to tell how to approach taking on these groups.
---
Piercing gaze especially should be limited to a handful of mobs in every major pack who will alert the others upon spotting you.
---
Ah too bad, PC players. I would have had so many plans for you, and could have crafted you a noice armor + weapons.
---
It is not just for PTS.
---
I have a shack ON the tracks
---
I‚Äôm goin to take it down
---
Lol I love it
---
I bet that most of us just take the workshops to complete the challenges. I say don't even wait for PvP. Just allow us to relinquish a claim on a workshop immediately. Let us do our business and clear out so somebody else can complete their daily chore. Having such unbalanced PvP in the Adventure Mode is stupid anyway.
---
I‚Äôve always loved the radio stations of fallout. So much so I listen to radio NV, Diamond city, Appalachia, and GNR on YouTube and have some of the soundtracks saved in Apple Music lol. But the game score itself has always been great. Both 4 and 76 have amazing scores. The first time hearing 4s menu music when I first got the game was amazing. And I was blown away when wastelanders released for 76, the updated 76 version of 4s menu music is just superb.
---
It's the full broadcast in it's fullest/clearest extent which is great to finally truly hear. 
---
Which lore-wise means the First Expeditionary Force is a month away from Appalachia. Makes sense in that case.
---
I would NEVER do it in a public server
---
I feel like if you have to ‚Äúpush through the pain‚Äù in a video game it‚Äôs not a good game
---
Lol right? I chased a level 4 for like 10 minutes trying to give him some shitty level 10 Two Shot troublemakers 10mm pistol I just looted
---
They can, ofc they are. All they need to do is check the item id and scan all accounts for these id's to remove. Optional disable this id's in the clients. They already did that previously shortly after release where the TSE weapons got their first major dupe wave, bethesda removed all items except for one if you had multiple of them.
---
The thing with anticheat is also not correct, they implemented one a few months ago just to disable it again due to players couldn't even start the game or launch into NW with a different language then English. They implemented it back a few weeks ago and did no further improvements, resulting in hackers are bypassing it with ease and cheat on. Also they are still able to dupe and stuff, last week there was a fix for a major dupe where people could dupe secret service armor within 5sec.
---
Salt
---
I kept getting that issue every time I went to the ash heap, thats why this update has so much potential as it could open up a lot more for low level while also making it worthwhile for high level players as the drop will be level related.
---
100% yes!!!!
---
Bloodied is 5% increased damage for every 5% health you lose, to maximum of 95% at 5% health. People usually try to stay just below 20% to benefit from *Nerd Rage* perk. But due radiation sources all over the game world you will usually be anywhere between that 19.9% and 10%, or even 5% depending on the situation and your skill as a player. I personally use diluted radaway when i'm closing in on that 5%.
---
If you know you know. Didn‚Äôt have much of a choice lol
---
If you are use ig emergency protocols is doesn‚Äôt really matter but T-65 will still give you the highest resistance
---
What happens if you fail an ops? Do you get to retry or wait until next day?
---
You ever play Contra?
---
I wrecked a few bloodied builds in Nuke zones without realizing it - my first character took rad sponge and I would try to group with people in Nuke zones to farm the mobs.
---
Every tick of rad damage anyone in the group took had a chance of healing the entire rest of the group of a decent chunk of rads. With even mediocre rad protection, this perkshare is enough to keep the rads entirely at bay... Players were frequently displeased when I would invite them only to start cleansing their rads immediately, and I usually tried to target the lowest health players.
---
Then youll never understand
---
I think one big reason is the survival tent.
---
No. Only the ammo converter and chicken coup
---
Why tf would you play something that hurts you that‚Äôs literally the most idiotic thing I‚Äôve ever heard
---
I could get you some ammo what type of ammo do you need
---
once in a while i buy it
---
.308 and plasma cartridges
---
I first did it as a 33 üòÇ I teamed up with a few buddies who are well into the levels. 178 and 200. I made sure I tagged him enough to get the loot and complete the mission for the lady at foundation (can‚Äôt think of her name)
---
I hope you have an n-pass... That or I hope you‚Äôre black.
---
That pop up is not sufficient. It doesn't explain that by taking that workshop, anyone can just snipe you out of nowhere at any time if you're standing in the workshop zone.  Until you get big dicked by someone 10 times your level who enjoys being the heel, you think "ah, so I guess someone might challenge me to battle over this property at some point? I'll decline and let them have it if that happens"
---
It is an exploit, against the TOS and very much a bannable offence. Will they actually ban people for it? Who knows. As lots of exploits have gone unpunished so far. But it does not mean abusing the blueprint exploit is 100% safe to use. 
---
Usually bans come in waves. Like the last dupewave bans. So they could be gathering information right now. I personally believe the bans are coming on that as it affects servers, and when it starts affecting server stability they start taking things seriously.
---
I believe you proved my point... youll never get it.
---
Agreed - on PC and do earl regularly. It never is done in under 5 minutes and usually it's a good bit longer than that.
---
Damn you‚Äôre dense
---
I thought I could do it I had a sort of 2nd floor garden ready made and then I couldn't place the trees. The disappointment.
---
Wow
---
Scrap storage made the biggest difference for me. I can store weapons, gear, and ammo now. And farming nuked zones on a private server is great. Along with farming resources from multiple workshops. Sometimes It's nice not having to deal people. The game tends to load quicker on private server too.
---
Its better then being "watered down"
---
My crew is always adopting new people in the fold. All over the age of 35, who have kids and just like to cruise the wasteland together. PiinkMonsta is my gamertag. Throw me an add or a message and come chill with us. We love meeting new friends.
---
According to Jeff BoS content is coming on November. So Still far away
---
So glad you love it so much. It really is great and good for friends.

Me or others can plant you melons. They work for food and drink.

I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE! ü§öüèΩ
---
Ayy say less
---
I'm on pc btw
---
And they can't blame covid this issue has been around since beta. The "hear" us but don't do anything popularly requested until months or years later. They don't seem to test things thoroughly or care about long lingering issues. Half ass new items and don't test them, releasing them broke as rewards or micro transactions. The most we ever hear is "we hear you, plan to, are aware of this" and unless its so big that the news picks it up theres no rush on it. Aka ounce of prevention needed for missions buuuut because its not dupes its a waiting game.  They have the worst support possible for a online multiplayer game as well.
---
Did it break? Broken armor pieces are moved to your inventory in case you don‚Äôt know
---
So am I. Actually playing right now.
---
I have it, I got it originally for a month to cram my scrap box full, I planned to then cancel it until I ran out of scrap. That was nearly a year ago now and I still havnt  canceled it.
---
For me it is the the tent that makes all the difference. Its nice being able to access your stash almost anywhere. 
---
I think it's about time Bethesda gave the scrap box out as a free item. I know there are some who wouldn't renew there subscription. It I reckon in enough people have got used to private worlds and the tent to keep paying.
---
Pc sorry just added it
---
Fallout 76's first intentionally existence was only to have multilayer in fallout 4. the devs did some internal experiments just for them self, after someone of the authorities noticed it worked somehow they wanted to make a pvp mode for fallout 4 (since co-op would be way too much work for a single player game and we already had companions). They realised that it wouldn't work with fallout 4 since they had to remake the whole game from scratch anyway, so they created a complete new game = fallout 76. The pvp aspect were always a thing, but they also implemented some pve content to make it not that boring. That's the reason we didn't had npc's or a solid main quest. Also the pvp gear was a huge thing.
---
At release fallout 76 was more pvp orientated, but whining, overencumbered excavator tourists claimed pvp being bad and with the duping, hacking and realisation how bad the whole game and balance is they moved one step after another away directed to a pve orientated game. Now we cant kill others without them shooting back, no more team pvp, hunter/hunted is rip and workshops aren't as funny as they were back then.
---
Tl;dr: fallout 76 were supposed to be a pvp game and workshop pvp is a small leftover since they were supposed to gather resources and fight for them instead abusing it for a temporary camp.
---
How does it affect server stability? Doesn‚Äôt it take up camp budget?
---
Nope, seems to just be gone. I fast travelled to the Purveyor and have been there the past two days, so not engaged in any combat to break it ... it‚Äôs very weird. I did get out of it and another player was looking at it, but they shouldn‚Äôt have any ability to interact with it. Just odd, I‚Äôm level 110 and this is the first issue I‚Äôve had like this.
---
Just wanted to make sure someone didn‚Äôt mislead you. üòä
---
Love my lever action. It's just way more fun than the bolt action and I love the reload animation.
---
It might be crazy enough to work...
---
But how would they keep us playing?! Enjoyable and rewarding content?! Ha, inconceivable!
---
No imma wait till like 1 p.m. eastern standard time in the U.S

I go just low enough (20%) to trigger Nerd Rage and stop right there.
---
good luck finding a legit one
---
To be honest the unlimited scrap storage has saved me on space! And the survival tent is an awesome feature to have. The emotes that come with first (dancing mothman, and protection shuffle) are a neat little bonus. I never use the ranger outfit, but just for those three reasons, ill never go without it!
---
Maggie IIRC, did she flip her lid on you as well?
---
Sounds good üëçüèΩ
---
I have the same issue with her. Think it's bugged. I do recall it being successful once however but after it bugging on me I never went back.
---
nice, maybe were neighbors.
---
Explosive energy weapons probably.
---
Beamsplitter makes 5 projectiles out of each shot and explosive adds another 5 hits, that's 10hits from a single shot.
---
Okay good to know, ill guess ill just leave it in my quest log then! Thank you!
---
interesting
---
I learned my lesson the hard way, lost loads of god roll and legacy weapons, this was ore dupe as well. Now I always get a friend to help out with big ticket items, 
---
I will use it for transfer common or cheap items but only ones I dont mind loosing.
---
Nah lol. I wanted to do the lie/charisma option but I just told her he turned into the colossus. She was like ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt deserve that fate‚Äù blah blah blah. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe they resorted to eating each other‚Äù blah blah blah üòÇ I should have lied lol.
---
But are you as sassy as Haile Selassie?
---
Its not just a matter of killing now though, with them being leveled no matter where your camp is not even the forest is safe anymore. Its like the overseer with a pipe pistol in nuka plant, literally just a distraction. Camp repairs are going to become the norm real fast and not in a balanced way. 
---
Where my camp was there was a chance a lvl 80 scorchbeast would spawn on top of it, hed destroy all the turrets, and a huge swath of my camp. My ally didn't even attempt to fight back, and because hit boxes and vats are having issues, fights with them can take a while leading to more wasted resources. 
---
All this rebalance is good for is exp and legendaries, but stims, ammo, camp materials and repairs are gonna further an already grindy game.
---
I buy it around every other month. I use one month to stock up on 30k caps across all characters then use that to buy every bit of useful junk and move it to my main, then store it all in my box. Then I have one month of not worrying about resources at all
---
Lol after this patch bloodied is still going to be the same pretty much. ü§£
---
It would absolutely help with server load.
---
Would love to enter, to make it fair only needing bloodied items so if they are not those, i will pass
---
But this is actually a time it makes sense. Because it would remove a ton of unique items that the server is keeping track of.
---
Oh hey, I‚Äôm on PC!  Would love anything if I get picked.  
---
Sorry ya didn‚Äôt like the game, but thanks for being generous about it!
---
Yeay, more currencys! Like we dont already have 20ish...
---
Sometimes if you do the ‚Äúlook away/spam‚Äù maneuver it works. She‚Äôs been bugged for awhile.
---
Can we just get all the guns from the past Fallout games? Like it would add so much variety to weapon choice....
---
OK, so I'll make a Perk Manager slot that swaps them all out. Good to know! Thanks.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of a risk. The last dupe wave ban only banned offenders for a couple weeks, and then gave them back their accounts, still with their duped items. Could you get banned? Yeah, cause it‚Äôs still an exploit, but unless they fix the issue itself, and delete everyone‚Äôs blueprint of the ammo factory, a ban would be pretty useless. I would say, very low risk, but still a risk
---
Hmmm I‚Äôm not sure tbh without looking at your build but the best advise I would give is play on a pc at least, I used to play on Console for 76 too and I can‚Äôt stand the 25 FPS and non stop skipping, Ino I improved at the game 10 fold by playing at 120 FPS
---
I upgraded with a ssd on the pro. I get 60fps solid.... minus one specific scenario in giving a Tesla rifle
---
I would be playing if the sale included legendary modules but It ain‚Äôt so I‚Äôm just taking a break from the BS and server lag XD
---
If only you could display Mothman eggs without spoiling.  Shame Wasteland cultists didn't learn decoration and building from you.
---
I don't know about the technical side but I hope for a better solution.
---
To add to your comment, ones with an exclamation point also give you score points with the next season coming in three days.
---
The PS4 pro is locked at 30 FPS, not sure how your getting 60 lol
---
Yes please! Would be great to maybe get a decent item finally :)
---
Poor memory XD my bad.  I was trying to remember which number...
---
Either way, I'm happy here.  Anything more helpful?
---
"The terminal used to operate the centrafuse does not analyze the blood samples and instead outputs "Requires blood" error messege.[verification needed]
---
Leave the server and go back to the main screen, then join Adventure Mode (public server) again. Now both quest goals "Install Type-T Fuse" and "Analyze Blood Sample" will appear again. After this, go to AVR Medical Center and install the Type-T fuse, then fast travel or otherwise leave the building and close the game. Reboot the game again and join Adventure Mode with both quest goals present. Go to AVR Medical Center and install the Type-T fuse once again, hit the terminal with "Analyze Blood Sample" and it should work.
---
This bug is slated to be fixed with Patch 22."

---
I find that if I get the right ingredients, but then cook them, the quest still marks those as done, but Chloe acts as you have observed. When I am careful not to cook or otherwise lose those parts, it completes successfully.
---
I'll happily show my build
---
I'll give that a try! Thank you
---
No your ok :) hopefully the next gen consoles will get a patch for 60fps, Ino Xbox said that most games will double the frame rate with a patch so maybe that includes ps5 too, who knows
---
I‚Äôm personally interested in Vault 34
---
Okay, ill try cooking them and see if that helps!
---
I think this is it.  https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3568b8&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22sx2pe2eg1cu2ck0ce0ip2s12i11a72a04a12lt2ls2l71eo2&amp;m=fe7b36

a build up of unusable treasury notes due to resale limit
---
Hopefully... I have too many friends on ps4 to quit the psn.
---
Cannot carry stuff or level up if you're dead.  üòÆ
---
I‚Äôll need to see your hole build to help you :3
---
Kinda hard to know what needs to be improved without seeing it
---
I decided to start collecting every prefix of explosive fixers, the very next day the event gave me a suppressor's one.
---
Drop it dead center to ensure maximum flux stabilizers from surrounding enemies.
---
D'oh. Xbox here. However, good luck all who enter :)
---
Hey, good on you, hope it goes well.
---
As much as I‚Äôd like to see that, it would create several guns that either outclass each other (basically meaning that by the end, the weapon diversity would be still just a handful of weapons) or are underpowered, or would just give us a bunch of sidegrades.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong - not every item added needs to be endgame, but with the sheer amount of weapons in the franchise, I just don‚Äôt think it would be feasible for the developers to add all of them and have them be usable.
---
I‚Äôd rather see some that would vary up play styles (Tesla cannon, a good semi auto pistol, an actual weapon specific to the auto pistol class, etc) and several more become skins for other, similar weapons, such as the laser RCW being a skin for a laser rifle.
---
" murmrgh plushie  " that is hanging from a tree and you can hit it  and it makes noise and click on it to set it on fire
---
I'm not sure other than making a YouTube video.  Nukes and dragons doesnt let me specify my weapon
---
Thanks :) I've picked up the mods at Grafton. I'm level 49 now and close to level 50 so I'm going to explore all the various options when I hit 50 :D
---
Thanks for the tips :)
---
Cool, cheers :D
---
11/10 wholesome
---
Well all your perks seem pretty good, if u want an extra 20% damage while fighting the queen you could put on nerd rage and go below 20% Heath and if u do that u can get the mutation adrenal reaction that will increase that damage a lot more, plus a bloodied weapon too if u have that but that‚Äôs not needed since u have a magic weapon
---
I'm curious how many queens will survive the 30min timer after patch 22 next Thursday...
---
And so you do. A lot.
---
"If your using a shotgun, just use vats and a magic weapon, easy!"
---
So literally admitting the only way to use shotguns under the new system is by getting one that shouldnt exist, as far as intended mechanics go
---
Me too, but from what I've been hearing it wont be TOO different
---
U don‚Äôt need to be a bloodied build to get a lot of the low health benefits, it might be worth using those benefits before the nerf on the 15th
---
I only started playing in late August so only got to level 50 in season 1 and  I'm super hyped for season 2 and fully taking part, so the excitement has distracted me from the wait xD
---
He stole his loot after killing him.
---
Judging from the amounts of tents and stash boxes I've seen proportionally, I'd guess it's between 10% and 20% on XB1.
---
I don't have it myself, so I have no opinion of it personally.
---
If I buy a legacy and it turns out it's duped, do I risk getting banned? I'm new on this game and don't really understand how this dupe thing works
---
Raiders will be raiders...
---
this shit is so fucking annoying bruh
---
50-80% is significant if you ask me. The perk cards themselve loose 50% total damage (from +60Ÿ™ down to &gt;23%)
---
This quest has been broken for me for months.
---
I have it and i love it, the scrap box is the best, i have half of my stash empty (when i don't have weapons and armor to scrap)  the tent with free fast travel is great, you can have access to the scrap box everywhere, or leave it in a certain location, usually i leave it close to nukes areas, also random free items or exclusive ones, atoms every month too, private world is the best for workshops, i honestly can't come back from it lol, mostly for the scarp box
---
Yeah,  but watching pts footage it isnt THAT much slower kill speeds
---
I'm gonna link that ladies YouTube video if you're interested
---
No sneak in Daily Ops!
---
On average enemys, yes. Scorchbeasts take way more bullets now due their damage resistance. I'm a bloodied heavy and took more then 10x more bullets and time to kill one mid air. Sadly I were alone on pts so it wasn't worth nuking prime.
---
Siren head ain't a cryptid mate, he's a trevor henderson creation.
---
 Level 36 Sniper in training! I would love to have only 1 good weapon, even if it's something I have to wait to grow in to ! PC player, as well! I don't need much, just asking for 1 item if possible. Thanks for your consideration!!
---
Nice catch lol
---
Sure, please!
---
If that lmg was magic you should have killed her in a single drum to the head
---
Without any spoilers, BoS have some reaction to mutations players
---
Yeah, idk...  she was killin avg stuff too so... can only hope it'll still be fun and not too nerfed
---
Steel Dawn isn‚Äôt on Patch 22 unfortunately
---
Nice build... Waiting for the glow in the dark map to rotate back into the store... also wheres your Sex Brahmin?
---
https://youtu.be/pDnqYDoYkbQ
---
I hope that helps a little
---
How much?
---
This. Absolutely this.
---
I put 2.5k in her face and it's a V 50LD 1P LMG
---
If we could trade players for these notes, I‚Äôd be all in. Caps are way too over saturated in the economy.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who seems to be getting broadsided currently. Swear she's unearthed a galleon somewhere that's why she's having this sale
---
Bloodied broadsider anyone? üôÑ
---
I mean we're already there with a handful of weapons being meta. I forgot that Bethesda is incapable of making weapons actually feel unique so most would just end up as side grades. Had a sense of hope and forgot what game I was talking about. 
---
With whatever weapons they do eventually add they should continue to move in the direction of cursed weapons and start trying to get away from their archaic legendary system.
---
Thanks man,  yeah I was attempting it without bloodied... was hoping the lmg would be enough
---
Except the combat tracks. Those just get obnoxious when the same three play constantly.
---
The other ambient tracks are great. Especially the ones for the burrows and Lucky Hole. Those two are amazing.
---
Honestly, when I see people say this, I almost never see a concrete reason. The only problem I see with her is that she should both have a quest and physical location attached to her, and also have more to say about the player‚Äôs actions.
---
If you really want a challenge... I'm looking for a Robobrain Interpolator and a Signal Repeater (both to display, rarely obtainable outside of their quests). If you need compensation, I can make it very worth your while.
---
PC here. Can I haz gun?
---
Biggest issue is they changed it toward the end of survival so that you don‚Äôt drop as random of amounts. 
---
So the cola guys with 9000+ Quantum would drop maybe 4-5 of them. (Example Numbers, I don‚Äôt actually know.)
---
Nice! She definitely has some good taste.
---
That's not a magic lmg 
---
For a magic lmg to actually work it needs either two shot or explosive plus a magic perk
---
Mods physically attach to your weapon or armour. You can only use them once, but they're permanent (until you replace them or scrap whatever they're on). You attach them at a workbench.
---
While I‚Äôm not exactly sure what‚Äôs archaic about the system, I would be happy for more effects unique to certain weapons. It‚Äôs why I use strangler even after it was nerfed into the ground - unique effect and appearance.
---
And maybe because I want to be the Vault 94 dwellers who definitely earned everything from the raids and didn‚Äôt just throw far too much bullion at the secret service.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs a Cryptid type creature. And I figured it was close enough.
---
Daily Ops will feature ONE new npc ( initiate Vernon Dodge ) at watoga center he will introduce you to the daily ops which is BoS related ... that‚Äôs said  don‚Äôt expect Steel Dawn Quest line
---
Edit:- and other location revamped like treehouse village has a new npc‚Äôs villager
---
BGS is screwing the non meta builds with this lazy implementation, all without re-balancing all the weapons classes accordingly. Had they boosted base damage to offset the nerf, then everyone would benefit. Instead they destroy alternate builds with an insincere smile and tell you it's for the best and fix the damage later. Sucks to be you. BGS will probably not bother buffing the weapons they made complete garbage if their track record holds.  They still haven't fixed the +250 damage resistance while reloading bug that occured well over a year ago, what makes you think they'll bother fixing this mess?
---
I'm new to the game and a 140 level just gave me 40 10mm rounds after he saw me using a 10mm smg (im lvl 11 btw)
---
Still not a cryptid, and again, it belongs to Trevor Henderson, so obvious it wouldn't ever be possible to be used.
---
That LMG shouldn't be magic in PA. It might be in combination with one of the magic armor pieces but in PA it's a normal LMG.
---
Now I'm confused. I'll hop on and check. :)
---
yes
---
It is with 50 limb damage.
---
I already tested it
---
Maaan. I was just throwing out a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù idea.
---
Ok Dope thanks
---
Wrong
---
I went to a low level at his camp, bought some stuff and dropped it back to him and added all of my extra plans, and he dropped me some stimpaks and water and it was just so wholesome. Love moments like that. 
---
Especially love when they don't run from me when I aggressively chase them with the gift emote halfway across the map.
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Some people have dozens of them in one place
---
Were you trying to open a trade window with them? I get people doing this all the time and it's super annoying. I don't trade in this game cept thru the forums, way too many scammers.
---
When I give stuff away I drop it and shoot at the bag and give the gift emote.
---
I was fighting a 3v1, but they had a fourth guy hidden in the workshop with a Chinese Stealth Suit crouched so Berry Mentats wouldn‚Äôt work. I found him eventually and obliterated him too. They gave up after I found him and accused me of cheating.
---
I feel you, I have known this since last week, also because of Reddit.
---
Always one prick lying in wait.
---
I still want a quest that lets you hunt an Evil Mothman.
---
Trapper also.
---
Bad rolls? ü§£
---
No, my apologies for being unclear: do not cook them. That‚Äôs how I was breaking the quest.
---
I probably should have worded this more delicately lol
---
Are we not getting a small quest this coming Tuesday with steel dawn?
---
Well, some of that was just talked about, not quite promised (larger camps and persistent workshops), but there's no way to transfer it between public and private, because private servers are just an instanced public server. That's literally how they did it. We don't even get our own server. That's why at conception the fallout 1st players would notice things like mobs getting killed, but not by them. Poor instancing.
---
As far as I remember, deathclaw masks were pretty rare. I never managed to get one during fasnacht
---
If it makes you happy and you didn't mind spending the caps then it's a bargain bud.
---
Hey thank you for the giveaway! Sorry to see you go, I just started playing a few months ago and personally I‚Äôve really enjoyed it and never expected to like it this much!
---
But how will we take a workshop from somebody else? Only real way to do it is to fight over it.
---
You need to hit n√©gative range, which can be achieved with short aligned barrel, powerfull automatic receiver and a suppressor.
---
When its done, your gun will have crappy damage outside of VATS and a 95% VATS hit chance, whatrver the distance and allmost no damage falloff.
---
But to compensate the very low damage, you need to use an armor piece with the -15% damage while blocking affixe
---
Congrats. I loved doing it that first time. You'll be amazed at how.much quicker you do the silo run the second go round.
---
lol why would they do that? the whole idea of legendary run and why it was implemented is to nerf amount of free atoms we get.
---
Yeah congrats. Use the PA glitch you can launch in 7-10 min.
---
You‚Äôd think with the Flatwoods Monster‚Äôs existence we‚Äôd get some kind of Alien DLC...
---
Okay got it, don't cook them
---
They are not cumulative.
---
afaik .no because Steel Dawn Quest isn‚Äôt complete at PTS  unless Bethesda surprise us
---
I use it and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd go back to playing without it.
---
The scrap box is a must for me, I love looting and scavenging and I have so much junk in that box to last me a life time. I just would not have any room in my normal stash to store junk and all the guns I collect.
---
The tent is nice, so when I‚Äôm out scavenging I can just set it up and deposit everything I have looted and keep going! 
---
The private server is nice but I like to do public events with a team so don‚Äôt use it as much but the atoms you get each month makes the price worth it as I love buying new camp items/apparel
---
Thoughts?  On the video,  I mean.
---
They got duped pretty decently so the rarity when down but that's still a good price.
---
Np lol
---
Oh... Yes. Excuse my inept reading skills haha
---
Leave the server, join a new one and try talking to her again. This works for me.
---
Honestly, as an end game character that never builds or crafts anything, I can barely justify the scrap box anymore. Just felt like I've been pissing ¬£12 up the wall over the months, patiently waiting for some good rewards. 
---
"oH bUt YoU gEt LoTs Of AtOmS" yes, you do. But the limited time system they have in place means I never want to buy anything incase there is a better investment the following week... and most of the stuff is like its been pulled from Fortnite. 
---
Gonna pull my subscription this month until they add something worth while.
---
Yeah, see my edit. Missed the 50LD part. :)
---
2.5k is way too many bullets. 2-3 mag if you aren't focusing on a single body part all the time, yes, but 2.5 is way off.
---
That pop up is better than the warning you‚Äôd get in real life. *Cough cough, marriage*
---
I've seen several people offering max caps for it recently, so yeah you did good.
---
Nice, you can fire it for a whole nother 5 seconds.
---
bought it once (one month) on PS4 for ranger armor
---
bought one month again on PC for the same reason
---
i can live without it, i don‚Äôt feel any limitation at all. Nice to have but not mandatory imo
---
Sorry, those are old replies. Im bad at reddit lol.  But yeah,  is it cuz I was 3manning on a private server? It decimates everything else but I feel like it just flopped on SBQ
---
Interesting that she tested out different weapons and made clear how much several weapons got affected. As I first joined the pts after the update 22 patch I also noticed the huge impact for the gat plasma which were my main dps weapon.
---
I'm somehow excited to finally see new meta weapons, maybe the lmg now get some love back after its huge nerf a while ago.
---
I can guarantee you that it will be question bombed regardless. :)
---
Stop right there, criminal scum.
---
Here's hoping!  I am excited too!
---
Or better stairs. All the other houses in the game have lovely corner stairs and we have straight up rubbish stairs.
---
Sorry you didn't like the game, its certainly not perfect and the grind is well... Grindy.
---
But yeah. Trying to do a junkies build so anything is welcome
---
I'll save this post to copy&amp;paste it whenever someone ask where the quests are...
---
üëç
---
This sub is a healthy mix of posts complaining about Bethesda neglecting the game, and circlejerking crap like this
---
No, the lmg doesn't have an effective fire rate high enough to properly trigger that magic perk
---
Since yours doesn't have two shot or explosive, it isn't "fully" magic
---
I'm not sure. I know that 50LD is a magic modifier but I've not had much luck with that. FFR on my LMG definitely works but all others are hit or miss.
---
I would still prefer an elevator tbh, at the very least a spiral stairway that only takes up 1 floor panel square.
---
Also, if you haven‚Äôt checked out the Fallout 76 roadmap for this year - please do!
---
https://twitter.com/fallout/status/1260933374090207234?s=21
---
I agree.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/reynardoldslyfox
---
You can thank dupers for the limits.
---
It is wasted to have damage perks 3x3 with update 22. Better stick with one single card at rank3.
---
When I have a low level character, I like to set my camp at pleasant valley station and complete the loop of buildings around the top of the world. You can generally can get 600 -800 caps (hard bargain 3) and there are a stack of resources you can scrap. There is also 8 mags and 6 bobble heads in the area to make easy sales.
---
I did the exact same thing on like level 10 lol, good times
---
So you're saying it's magic lite?  I can agree to that... bit saying its not magic is wrong
---
What? Magic effects occurs since the server lag, there is a problem with damage calculation. Literally nothing impacts clientside.
---
I think it's magic but it's not as effective.  It definitely hits harder than it's supposed to. This ive tested, and logged on YouTube
---
 Totally agree, can't play because my character is over cumbered, so I log in and trade the limit then logoff. Is unplayable the way it is, my stash is also full. The game is awesome, but these little things are really making me losing the feeling.
---
I unfortunately don't got junkies sorry
---
Magic effects only work properly on shotguns or weapons past 100 fire rate, the video you linked likely even mentioned that 
---
Your gun has a magic effect, but isn't actually "magic" unless you lag badly
---
After you get through the first part where you have to get the biometric keycard there's a door on the left side of the hallway go through it and kill the 2 or 3 robots and there will be another door to the left that will say terminal required or something. crouch down and position yourself to the left or right or the door and look straight at the corner where the door meets the doorframe. Hit start to bring up map, hit Y to enter photo mode and move the camera down and forward until your character disappears and hit b, you should be on the other side of the door. If it doesn't work try a few more times you will get it it's not difficult. Once through head straight to the big door and do the same thing. Once through go left and into mission control and complete normally. Boom silo complete in 15 mins or less and barely any ammo used.
---
My gun has a higher FR than 100. See for yourself.  https://youtu.be/ScqNZjG9lwU
---
Heavy weapons has the least mods. No weapon with more then 5ish mods in total, where rifles has 45 and more. Also the most affected weapon is the gatling plasma loosing more then 80% in total.
---
Also damage perk cards are changed dramatically, 3x3 perks are now 25% in total instead of 60%. (20%, +20% of that 20% = 4%, 20%+4%=24% and so on, its additional instead of multiplied).
---
No I've run into that problem as well, I did the drop bag method
---
I‚Äôll never forget the first time I started FO4 and heard the music. Chills. That steady piano melody, so simple and fitting.
---
this sale?  5 good rolls from 4 characters maxed scrip. but historically yes as most do
---
That‚Äôs strange, what are your damage numbers? It really shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult for the three of you, unless it‚Äôs bugged. You don‚Äôt need magic weapons to do the queen. Just 9 heavy gunner buffs + stabilized + bloody mess + Adrenaline is plenty powerful.
---
You have 2 main factions: peaceful, foolish hippies just trying to farm some materials or possibly experiment with the build system without using up their own junk/having to tear down their CAMPs, and warmongering meanies who at best are looking for honest PVP but won't find much in the hippies, and at worst get off on cheap shotting people. These latter folk don't care at all about the resources and will just sit on the destroyed workshop extractors until they get bored and leave.
---
So the former now know better than to take workshops, and the latter don't get their PVP fix from them. In other words, it's a failure. Definitely needs rejiggering.
---
I have four broadsiders that I'm counting as the better of today's output.
---
Giving in and trying to roll for armour the rest of the week... At least it weighs less in your stash box
---
You're not wrong!
---
Yeah... that aint gonna happen... no one hands out money for free...
---
I got a J2525HM and a JFFR90 Minigun from him.
---
Pretty happy.
---
lol I came to comment this
---
Man, I got a Bloodied/50% Crit/Reload one the other day. I was so excited until I tried it and was reminded that they are absolutely garbage...
---
I thought it was 100 gold for three but last time I told that I was told I was wrong and it was 100 gold for 1 and a max of 3 a day.
---
Do you have a source or do you play the pts? I'd love some clarification thank you.
---
It is possible, yes. But also highly unlikely that you'll find some now.
---
With the legendary perks coming next week is the "ammo factory" and experiments have shown that ultracite-ammo will then have the highest yield. So most people will keep their stock for that.
---
Some suck it deeper than the others, I sucked it enough by buying his buggy mess I don‚Äôt have to suck it more by paying more for his buggy mess
---
Yeh what is the deal with the stairs, sitting in the middle rather than to the side, they had them in F04...
---
No. They were promised on the website when it first came out.
---
I bought a year.  I think it was worth it.
---
This 1000% this
---
It would be better to say "reward you with a random legendary weapon.". They aren't guaranteed 3 star - they are often 3 star, but not always.
---
I mean dying is not very punishing... it‚Äôs a little dramatic to opt out of workshop challenge just to avoid pvp.
---
But having the extra option to immediate abandon the workshop just even only for the sake to not being forced drag to a defend event is an idea worth supporting.
---
I am too old for these sliders, it needs a better interface for me.
---
One where I can select my weapons (and it's modifier) and the perks I use.
---
There are only three ‚Äúlegacies‚Äù that are definitely not duped and they‚Äôre not tradeable. GSE Gauss shotgun, TSE Gauss shotgun and I think an IE Gauss shotgun.
---
Alternative to what? That site just compares weapons, it does not show the damage after the nerfing.
---
They are legit findable it‚Äôs all just an insane amount of luck with RNG. If the game actually gave you a way to farm a certain type of weapon or certain rolls could be guaranteed it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.
---
Mistake on my part, it has to be 200+
---
I am there again at the moment, too. I played the legendary lottery yesterday night because of the purveyor sale. Now I am stuck with too many crappy legendaries I don't need, stashed the few that fit my always crowded stash and that might be worth selling. I can't scrap the others because I already used the 150 limit already and my pockets are too small for all the broadsiders I got. Now I have to pause 24 hours before I can get rid of it. Throwing them away might also be an option, but meh. ;)
---
Love it! I appreciate your Mr. Pebbles shrine, I have something similar. I feel like his campaign manager sometimes.
---
I agree entirely. I'm a veteran fallout 4 player and I always build my pc as a sneaky sniper, rarely getting into close combat and if I do I use a silenced shotgun. 
---
But in fallout 76 I'm only just level 30 and I have had several times where I went for the unclaimed workshop that no one claimed . Only for a player to to to the workshop kill me and then to away without even claiming the workshop themselves. I can't handle a 1v1 with a level 300 wearing power armour and mini nukes with a sniper that I lose my sneak advantage and leather armour.
---
Support
---
Fuck compromise get rid of these fucking limits. We bought the damn game already. Just because it's on game pass now doesn't make it freemium.

Deguerre gave me a bloodied limb damage mini gun üòç

---
Haha guys Ammo factory bad haha make sure u grab the ammo haha it‚Äôs so bad and wrong haha
---
The quick change doesnt work with the plasma caster. Its infuriating for me. Cus I use that for mobs at SBQ and CP, then switch to minigun or gatling laser for the Queen or Earle. But because it wont quick switch back to the Caster (instead switching to a different weapon I havent even used in a while) I have to use the quick wheel, which on occasion just freezes the game and locks me up for sometimes 30 seconds +
---
Considering people place like 10 of them down all next to eachother, yes. It's a public space. Private servers, go nuts. But if I hear the ammo factories in the base, I'll just power arnor through the walls and go ham on those machines.

PC. Many put down pne or two but I've seen 10 at someone's base before. So damn loud.

Please tell me you can join the mothman cult cos I soo would

I don‚Äôt think they can afford to ban people permanently
---
forcing all non-auto users into stealth is not balancing IMO, it is simply workaround players come up to make new damage system bearable.... 
---
and in Daily Ops stealth do not work, event bosses ignore stealth modifiers, so if player want to get into high end content with incoming patch - welcome to commando or heavy gunner. "perfect" balance...
---
Played since release and the 400lb scrap box. I know the struggle. Now I have the long-term 1st subscription. Now you'll take away the bottomless scrap box and survival tent from my cold dead hands.
---
Seriously though it's reassuring to know that, provided you keep a good flow of materials into your scrap box, you can make any ammo, weapon or armor at any time with no drama. Stable flux also goes there and so is weightless.
---
The survival tent changes your daily runs completely. When you're doing the grind for reputation for example, you (obviously) put your camp near Foundation and your tent near Crater. That way you can flit back and forth without spending FT caps.
---
Overweight and don't want to hop into your Excavator PA? Pop up that tent and scrap what you can.
---
Yeah, I lost plans this way, including a Plan: Radiation Barrel. üò≠
---
That looks sick idk what it is- Tesla arms? Does grounded have a proc?
---
The mechanics you see are because of the constant whining. People want to PvP and. Bethesda needs to add more outlets for it with an incentive behind them.
---
The closest I came to your number was by adding the modifier to the base damage and then calculate the damage of the other modifiers. But then your conclusion wouldn't be correct...
---
Are you sure no other perk is active like legendary perk?
---
Let me guess. Delayed?
---
Haha. You nailed it. (I‚Äôm solidly in the hippie faction.)

how? playing too much
---
level? 400
---
how often? too often
---
At least that was a fair fight (well, to you). But that hasn‚Äôt been my experience.
---
I am surprised there isn't an event with the alien one, amazing looking and the fact it can control turrets and monsters is really cool
---
People who abuse the ammunition factory glitch are scum of the Earth.
---
Honestly, I don't know what was that. I don't think so that was the Tesla Arms. Grounded? Maybe, but grounded's description denies it.
---
Still hasn't been fixed ra-ra just got stuck staring at a computer monitor in the power armor room.
---
The Raider's Ammo Co is torally fair in terms of ammo for most weapons. Auto types like 50 cal and 5mm I feel need to be higher but still alright
---
Depends what you consider high priced I suppose, I will never get pissed and send someone a message, although I think a player has filled there vendors with crap to attract customers then I will find the nearest mob of enemies and bring them back to the camp to destroy the vendors/power source to remove it from the map.
---
Doable if at max caps when you travel and are near enough,you cant buy it usually but if your teammate completes a quest that 16 caps might be enough. Its how I got hold of my first ever legacy ;) though thats brave of the vendor to put that on
---
Eh, it‚Äôs the Wastelands. Use whatever you can even if it‚Äôs illogical. (Insert *sigh* Bethesda)
---
No worries I'm OK and trying for armour anyhow.
---
Thank youfor being generous though and hope you enjoy your next game more than this one!
---
OMFG. Time to dust off the Troubleshooters BOS Heavy Combat Armor
---
Yes . I . Do. 
---
I wanna join the mothman cult. 
---
Serve the master . 
---
Serve the mothman 
---
Also add in indrid cold . Aka the grinning man .
---
Same here mate but unfortunately I'm British and haven't had the chance to visit point pleasant. 
---
Also there's a good documentary about mothman on Amazon prime that was pretty good
---
Why do I have a feeling they outsourced production of models then just slapped them together willy nilly
---
In real life it could work. 
---
A round chambered in .45 will fire through a 12ga suppressor as clearance isn‚Äôt an issue. What would be more of an issue are things like correct barrel threading, true barrel-suppressor axis alignment, potential baffle strikes, and some other wonky stuff that is both firearm &amp; ammo dependent.
---
Could work though.
---
Saving post, I really wanna know what's going on there. Never seen that before....
---
A level 20 traded with me and demanded that I gave him my AA Fixer for free. Nope, sorry bud.
---
Don't forgot the Chinese Assault rifle (communist skin).
---
Just wait till you meet the bloodied and stealth builds. Total dicks.
---
And the Chinese Assault rifle (communist skin).
---
The chances that one will and can be bugged out like this are around 95%. :)
---
It‚Äôs what happens when you remove the incentive to troll lol
---
Yeah, I wanna have this today for my bloodied heavy. That was OP crowd control. What is funny - I can't find this effect on YT.
---
You‚Äòd deserve more help and donations than the BOS at Atlas
---
Keep it up fellow dweller!!
---
My appreciation of OPs username would screw your brains out.
---
If you want I can give you some decent stuff! What platform are you on?
---
Does it matter that I‚Äôm only a level 20-something?
---
Also, what lead to the game becoming boring for you? Although I‚Äôve just started playing a few weeks ago, as a long-time Fallout fan, it doesn‚Äôt seem anywhere near as bad as many have made the game out to be. Playing solo has been fun.
---
Yeh I had a quick look and nothing. Gonna upvote in the hope it gets the right attention, I'd love to know what it is.
---
Nothing wrong with moving on if you're not having fun anymore. I'd be glad to take some gear off your hands though.
---
No proc for grounded. I use grounded
---
The "here comes the nuke" tune that plays when close to the bomb area with the creepy violins and feel of despair is really damn cool as well.
---
I may have to add you as well my GT is HOLLOWxTIP 7387 I‚Äôm always looking for more people to play with!
---
I have it. It's ok. Good to transfer stuff between characters. Recommend monthly over annual subscription.
---
Nice find!
---
Were they selling any other guns like this?
---
I wouldn't worry too much if its duped, because how were you to know?
---
Buying 10000 stimpaks for 1 cap a go may mean you are guilty by association but you paid for that gun fair and square.
---
Go enjoy your electric glow stick gun :)
---
The Enclave Uniform
---
Any pics of exact location?
---
You wrote all of this because someone took a workshop from you? Wow
---
This is absolutely correct. With how they have certain parts of the game set up, there isn't much of a reason to spread your effort across multiple characters versus focusing on one. If they make any sort of significant consequences that end up locking you out of content, that's going to alienate a lot of players.
---
speedrun for getting a post yeeted for being a cunt
---
Workshops are PvP areas.
---
No, dipshit, read the post.
---
I realized that Fao 76 is one of the friendliest gaming communities I have ever witness on my entire gaming life. I love this community
---
Interesting that you picked that one thing to base an argument on.
---
Lol you're talking about a minority of players who do that, calm down. If anything you sound like you got your ass kicked.
---
My thoughts exactly lol.
---
I‚Äôve read it. You‚Äôre generalizing bloodied players because a small % of those players are bad. You‚Äôre the toxic one out here dude.
---
But for scrip you can roll SS Armor and Gauss weapons. Some people are past spending caps at player vendors. And you wouldn't *have to* buy 300 scrip for 6k. Like, I'm done with buying Gold Bullion for caps
---
13 fully legit.
---
You obviously didn't read it, at the end of the post I thanked those who don't act like that, therefore I'm aware of the fact that not all act like that, nice try though.
---
I hadn't realised they put strain on the servers,I'll have to do a little sabotage next time I find one 
---
Remember players will tend to hide them underground so keep your eyes peeled
---
The title is literally to all bloodied stealth players and the first words are eat my ass.
---
Because it's how I forget about how shit the actual world is. It's escapism pure and simple. 
---
I love this game. I wouldn't play anything else.
---
PM your XBL gamertag. I have tons of water and can provide you with a decent amount of food too. Can probably drop some ammo too.  
---
I‚Äôm practically itching to give some of it away because I just have so much. Too much.
---
I couldn't have set it better myself. IRL I do feel somewhat lost and listless these days, but in 76 I'm the Nuke dropping, ammo farming, plan dropping junkie who helps newbies make their first build.
---
It's bait, because I knew I'd see people like you here :) still says at the end of the my post, read it over and over if you must, you aren't very smart. Keep it going though I'm enjoying this.
---
Do you use chems normally?
---
I traded a Deathclaw mask for a B2525 LMG  when they had more value.Ive still got one and wouldn't part with it for caps.
---
It sounds like the mutation electrically charged. It can wipe out low level enemies pretty well, but the range is kind of buggy.
---
No it‚Äôs still coming on ‚Äú Fall ‚Äú which is starting at 22th September but patch 22 which includes FALL content is out early a week before Fall starting so my best guess Steel Dawn ( and Bomb Event) is coming October or November. Fractured Steel might be delayed at this rate
---
As a considerate bloodied sneak commando build I feel I should vent about poorly equipped or low level players joining public events when they have no place being there. 
---
I spent my first 6 months playing a junkies build and got slightly annoyed occasionally but I have seen less and less arsehole bloodied player for the last few months. Most of us run quad or vampire weapon during public events. Or even invest in a pipe weapon  to use up 38 ammo.
---
However I have seen a huge influx of low level and poorly equipped players joining public events they have no place in being. Worse still is when they go xp farming in my legendary hunting ground but dont clear the entire area so when I cone along there is still 1-2 shitty low level enemies that need clearing before anything respawns .
---
Looking by your comment karma you truly are enjoying being in the wrong. It's a shame your post has been already removed for breaking the subreddit rules.
---
Somehow that's a quote i saw before
---
Oh boy you sure showed me, better go cry and write in my diary.
---
It's not uncommon. They actually made it harder to do it but it's still not rare.
---
I feel bad that you have come to feel this way about the game, I have had it the same way with some other games but would feel honored to take over whatever treasure you hold:3
---
Yeh those guys are the good ones, I quite often get lower levels dropping radaway for me because I'm bloodied. I hand stim packs back to them or even ammo.
---
These are not "small adjustements".
---
They edited every single damage effect, damage buff and weapon mod of the game
---
I carry 20 stimpaks as a bloodied build so eh, however if i use them is debatable
---
I agree, there should be some sort of matchmaking implemented that groups people up in their own instance depending on what level they are.
---
It's actually around 100 fire rate, and conditions apply.  AngryTurtle did a fairly detailed video on his youtube channel about it.
---
It's not a him it's a she.
---
Please do, i was so happy when a level 400 was hanging out side the vault on my exit, character after pretty much screwing the first build by trying to do a bit of everything without specialising, he dropped a couple of large handmade gifts(500 caps in one of them) some shotgun shells and 1000 steel and some meds, made life in the first few levels so much easier!
---
They really didn't change much. They just updated the model to be more realistic.
---
The generosity ü§£
---
Not really
---
Well, Steel Dawn isn't coming yet, but patch is gonna feature some new BoS content. Is really minor, but won't say much more in case someone consider it a spoiler.
---
wait, what gun?
---
That's the poison damage hazard Earle creates when he shoots his poison projectile. Unless you got poison resist armor, you should avoid it at all costs.
---
Asbestos is fine for the fire. Fireproof is unnecessary in tandem.
---
Brilliant idea. Simple and would save so many problems. Ive been trying for a set of troubleshooters ss armor in prep for the daily ops and have a full stash of the rejects that will probably take me days to clear.
---
Can someone tell me why i cant do daily challenges anymore? I was about to unlock a metal ghillie suit but there are no more challenges coming up, its been 2 whole days now, how else can i increase my s.c.o.r.e.
---
Yes an absolute masterpiece tbh
---
Oh so he actually has different attacks for each head? What are the orange bubbles then..some kind of fire attack?
---
Do it. The stat loss is negligible
---
Pi√±atas at workshops with tons of junk. I put it in my vendor to sell to FO1st players. The circle of life.
---
It depends on your build. If you want use melee i would prevent addictions with -str for example. Mentats is a must have addiction because it will just give -1 charisma. The rest will give -1 for 2 different specials at least. I play two junkies and if i remember right i have addictions which give me -1 to all except charisma. Charisma has -2. But its definitely worth it. You can push your specials with mutations and food as full health player
---
it's a calculation change.
---
before any damage increase was multiplicative, now it's additive.
---
If D is the base damage (let say 100), and you had +30% from perk and +25% from something else, the final damage is 100\*1.3\*1.25 = 162  
---
Now its 100\*(1+0.3+0.25)=155
---
Some content will be disabled in the patch similar to how A Colossal Problem slept dormant since April.
---
It does. :3
---
Congrats. I launched my first one Monday night. It was a neat experience.
---
I use shotguns.Which chems should i use?
---
Yeah they applied the same logic to their scrip values as they did to their atom packages and actual item prices. It annoys the crap out of me playing scrip tetris too trying to squeeze as much out of the limits as possible.
---
I agree. It's such a shame the first major female DJ was made to be so bland, Three Dog, Mr New Vegas, even Travis had the wildly different personalities whereas Julie is just some sappy reddit girl
---
Thanks very much!
---
Thank you
---
Haha thanks
---
The Legendary Run ended on the 8th, so there are no more challenges until the next season, Armor Ace, that starts on the 15th.
---
This comes with a new set of rewards so I don't think you'll be able to unlock any more things from the first season.
---
Some items will be available from the end game vendors, but I think cosmetic items are not.
---
Haha
---
Thanks
---
Rads
---
Maybe you need a better source for news.
---
That would be awesome! Those spooky vines as well would be nice
---
Hopefully soon man
---
Let me check. I d say since shotguns are most effective in vats you dont want to lose agility
---
Yeah, on pc, no need for caps haha - Same name as reddit
---
Ok thank you for the info. Its been very helpful. Looks like I should try and roll some poison resistance in some armor too. Any idea how much I should try and get?
---
Dude I can do you one better, it takes a little more ingredients but herbivore+brainbombs+cranberry relish is even better;)
---
No true
---
Can you please let me know in DM?
---
Weirdly that doesn‚Äôt happen for me and I‚Äôm on Xbox too. I sell them really cheap too so not sure why they hardly sell if I‚Äôm honest..
---
dailies from legendary run? if it is, season 1 is done and dusted. wait for season 2 next week. you are not the only one who have not finish the legendary run. me too.
---
You on PC?  I rolled 2-3 solid ones during the sale so far.
---
One Wasteland can lick my ass, but the rest of the update seems like a lot of fun.
---
I think i have about 15 or 16 agility
---
Ok no worries i thought my game was broken thank you for the info, im on old office potato pc i have i7 2600, gtx 1650, 12gb ram and a wd black. I face little micro stutters other than that the game is running at a solid 60fps do i need an ssd for this game? (Do you think that would sort out the micro stutters? It feels like its loading things in)
---
No it does not work like that. Everything is about base damage.
---
If you have 100 base damage, and you have +30% from perk and +25% from something else:
---
Before: 100\*1.3\*1.25 = 162
---
Patch 22: 100\*(1+0.3+0.25)=155
---
you can't use stealth in daily ops ;)
---
I change them to shotgun rounds... unless gamma rounds are really easy to make? I thought people use them for pvp
---
I wish they'd add some Mr. Pebbles flair.  I'm sure there are more than a few who would love to show their faith.
---
Strenght-21
---
Preception-7
---
Endurance-10
---
Charisma-4

Intelligence-15
---
Agility-15
---
Luck-9
---
Some have bonuses like strenght with the deathclaw steak(+4)but thats just a temporary bonus.I mostly have bonuses on my armor.
---
Many have the ammo factories for their standard weapons. I just orefer inconvenience over all lol
---
This is what we call Context Clues
---
I did exactly the same, didn‚Äôt get any till around that level.
---
There‚Äôs a quest where you have to build some excavator power armour in the ash lands, and you have to do it with like, 49 pieces of ore which you get from the mole people.
---
After that quest, I haven‚Äôt really used it. It‚Äôs very bulky and I found that I was carrying power cores for no reason which way a ton compared to everything else.
---
I have one at my camp for when I do need to take down particularly BIG enemies, but that‚Äôs it.
---
Bro you must me doing ok if you‚Äôre level 116. I‚Äôm with you on this, love the game and can get lost in it for hours.
---
Sure it‚Äôs got it‚Äôs issues, but who cares when you love the world so much.
---
I‚Äôm a father, but not a single father. I understand the escape you get with this game, but can‚Äôt imagine how good it feels to escape into 86 when you‚Äôre a single dad and you‚Äôve had a tough day.
---
Big respect to you my dude! I have step kids too, who‚Äôs fathers have never bothered with them, I mean being m a dad is not easy, but you doing it on your own makes you a hero in my eyes, as well as how lazy they are.
---
I don‚Äôt know what servers you play on, but I‚Äôm a father who plays when my kids are in bed too, I‚Äôd be happy to play with you and out dumb ass‚Äôs can walk the wasteland figuring stuff out together lmao!
---
Ok. With buffout, daddy-o, daytriper, mentats and psycho addictions you will have -2 strength, -2, charisma, -1 intelligence, -1 endurence, -1 perception, -1 luck and -10 damage resistance. No negatives on agility. But its just an example. Check out your build and addiction effects and you will find your combination. After all even if you choose an addiction with -1 agility it wont make a gamechanging difference in the end
---
Amen to that
---
Thank you dude.
---
I use X-01 and have a carry weight of 335. If you‚Äôre overcumbered in power armor either you carry more stuff on you than you should or you haven‚Äôt invested in calibrated shocks.
---
I needed a workshop a few days ago for the metalworker badge and kept it running while making coffee. When I came back I was dead and had to fight a heavy gunner. Problem is I am using a shotgun and I always get shot already before I get close enough to do some damage. I hate that. I don't need other weapons for the regular game, but in PvP it's crap.
---
And I don't want to fight over a lousy workshop in the first place. I need the resources for something and when I am done crafting you can have it. With all the extractors and defense I already build. ;)
---
I like this idea. I hope it happens since with Beth, I've noticed if they ever buff something it is smol.
---
Would go very far for quality of life.
---
I totally agree. This "I want a nicer way to say no" is ridiculous. But Bethesda is already working on it.
---
Can we get any guerilla weapon? Its not even funny at this point.
---
To the level 15 that just dropped me the Stimpack. Your mom's a hoe
---
if you look around, you can see she also disarmed a pistol trap (pistol in question is on the floor, no tripwire), but she may have not been fast enough because directly across from it is a dead mole miner partially exposed in the wall
---
Np mate. If you use my combo with -2 charisma you wont be able to share any perk anymore if you only have 4 on it. Maybe swap the daytripper with something else and take -1 agi. Or swap a special point to charisma. I would make sure that you are still able to share a rank 1 perk at least
---
You take the ammo factory once. Then you learn to pvp or stay away from it.
---
I use X-01 power armor religious like I only take it off when I need to craft something or I‚Äôm at the house building. I‚Äôm level 56 now. When I was level 25 I was using T-45 power armor. There are multiple power armor spawn sites around the map you can look up and they have a chance of spawning with pieces already on them just go to one and keep server hopping until you get a full set you can use.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox though I can craft you a full set of excavator armor level 25 for free I would just need you to go get the black ore since I don‚Äôt have much but I should be able to cover the rest of the materials.
---
Powerfist is considered the best Unarmed Weapon because it has an Armor Penetration mod, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Looks like some sorta bug. Hopefully they make it a feature and name it atomic farts.
---
When I first started playing and  I was still a low level I though the call over emoticon meant the other player wanted to fight, so I used to run away, anyone else? Nope? Just me then? Okey dokey.
---
Well that sounds reasonable, but didn't fit with what I saw on pts yesterday. I'm at work so I sadly don't have the recorded numbers I noticed, but with my gat plasma I had more damage shown with a single rank3 damage card then three rank1 cards. Also the damage increase got lower with additional cards, the first increases the damage of my gat plasma for 13 damage, the second card did only add 8 damage to the damage. I disabled all perk cards, unequipped all armor and gone 100%life.
---
I assume it is depending on which gun you are testing, or it is simply just buggy or not stable.
---
Yup, I always report them and take enough screenshots to absolutely guarantee that Bethesda has enough proof to punish them. I don't understand why people would risk their accounts being flagged or banned over just ammunition... it's a complete joke and a pathetic way to lose accounts with hundreds of hours of investment. Caught a level 800 player doing it with their entire clan who were controlling workshops all over the map and working together; next ban wave is going to suck for all of them.
---
Im not entirely on that boat, bloodied min/maxing is overkill for the most part, i am some what sympathetic to it when it comes to being able to fight a boss solo but the problem on weapons comes down to automatic being the only way to have any real input during harder events. The gauss weapons/ laser weapons have their own problems that only make the semi auto/rifleman problem worse. 
---
Bethesda‚Äôs main focus should be making everything viable as an end game build without you having to go to long lengths for the privilege. Commando perks on an automatic rifle anything = decent, gunslinger on specific guns with specific effects = passable but you have to be sneaking, it has to be night time for you to benefit from sandman, you have to be mutated, you have to buff with mags/food.
---
It just feels like they made the game around automatic weapons and anything else that has found a place in regards to damage/being viable is just an oversight like the magic weapons.
---
Try to do rose's quests at top of the world, she will give you a full raider set after you did what she want from you. Also you have to do these quests anyway to progress the mainstorry quests. The power armor will be at your level to use instantly.
---
Optional someone can craft one for you, doing it yourself could be problematic since you need the plans and alot of resources.
---
Bloodied. 50cal with 25% faster fire rate. They. Are. Op.
---
Gatling guns are my preferred heavy weapon , decently high damage output but painfully slow to fire -  They're good for ammo conservation too.
---
Theres gatling lasers too if you dont mind energy heavy guns cus fusion cores are real easy to get so you dont have to worry on ammo. See a lotta people using G.Lasers about 
---
Gatling plasmas are beefy for raw damage ( if you can get a prime receiver on it especially). I'd highly recommend it if you can maintain it and get enough cores for it.

---
The 150 is logical only in the sense that armor is based on multiples of 3 and weapons on multiples of 5. I‚Äôd actually propose 175 if any increase because it allows your 4 3* while the remaining 15 is either a 2* weapon or a 2* armor and 2 1* armor.
---
I only have 3 of the masks the goblin the sun and the man and it‚Äôs so annoying I can‚Äôt get a 4th to fill my display case I always have an empty spot and I can never find anyone selling them It sucks lol
---
I'm just tired of the game im level 200 basically the updates are usually dog shit or just over all buggy and broken i enjoy it but I hate the people that own it the constant grind for hopefully cool shit is daily I havent played in about 3 months and the brotherhood hasn't arrived yet so I think its kinda wack I think the battle pass broke me into hating Bethesda I honestly wish he would give the game back the obsidian and then they can fix fallout 76 and Todd would have his whole team work on elder scrolls 6 but its whatever hope you have fun and no your not level 100+ so you good
---
Fellow dad here. My PSN is Rage-Quit-Dad. 
---
Feel free to add me and I‚Äôll tag along with you. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind pumping them full of lead and you getting the kill.
---
You know, *that* gun.
---
Welcome to the wasteland fellow dweller.
---
I hope your experience didn't had a huge negative impact, stuff like this mostly only happens when being low level. Enjoy it as long as possible, once hitting lvl 50 and aquire some decent equipment everything will be more easy.
---
Level 165 and haven‚Äôt used it once except to finish the excavator quest
---
When you apply all AA effects unarmed builds have the difference will be between DCG 75% armor penetration and PF 80% armor penetration, which is not much. On bosses (using as example because of high DR they have) the dps difference is 12% in favor of DCG.
---
Counter suggestion: make scrip like treasury notes. No limit on how much we can acquire, but a daily limit on how much we can spend instead(let's say 200 because that's roughly what we get daily now and it lines up with the T note limit). Sales could then be increasing the spending limit, no need for another currency.
---
Same thing just happened to me. Thanks Bethesda üòÉüëç
---
I'm also someone that plays alone - at least in the sense that I have no friends to play with. But I recommend joining public teams whenever possible. I do it every time I play and most of the time I keep to myself, but now and then I encounter a teammate that is super friendly. Yesterday a level 200+ took me on quite an adventure. I died a lot, I used up all my supplies, but I also level up a lot and got a whole bunch of gear from that player and the quests we did together.
---
In the end, he purchased a lot of ammunition from my vendor and said good bye, which was a cherry on top of this awesome evening!
---
Nah it didn't too much but I think I'm going to stick to the forest a little more and finish a couple of quests there rather then trying to rush higher level areas . Plus I finally got a railway rifle so I'm happy lol
---
Thanks for the concern though üòä
---
My first character had full suits of power armour up to T60 by level 20 because I collected them all up 
---
You can start using it at level 15
---
Maybe, still seems like a waste of a legendary perk slot.
---
Full vanguard's is pointless
---
I feel like it‚Äôs common sense. Literally common sense that as soon as you go to claim a workshop you should throw all your junk in a stash beforehand. If you die and lose your stuff well that‚Äôs your fault for not taking the right precautions.
---
Did they ever fix the bug where four lunchboxes will remove the content buff entirely?
---
Bloodied build
---
What console are you on, I can help with better guns and armour
---
Dense torso mod
---
It is reproducible with literally any ore. I am lvl 1017, friends are also +1000 due that circumstance. Hell we grinded that bug for the legendary run...
---
Oh I think it is too personally but it does still have some benefits to those that use rejuvenated and want to keep the buffs going I guess.
---
Inon Zur is the genius behind the actual game music. He also made the amazing Fallout 4 music, and worked on the music for Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.
---
Inon Zur also made the music for Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II.
---
He also made the music for The Elder Scrolls: Blades, and since Jeremy Soule is gone, one might be right in guessing that he'll also compose the music for TESVI.
---
And possibly lvl 3 fireproof
---
what's the Bomb Event? Thought I was keeping up with what was coming up but this is new to me
---
Serendipity and other protection cards.  That, and mastering the marsupial jump shot.
---
Whenever I help out new players they always give me their stuff and then I have to explain that I have +200 in my stash and person. It's adorable and that's why I love new players haha.
---
Why i mean a junkies build can use vaungaurds.
---
Bethesda: We heard you clear! In future we will allow 10mm pistol to change it's calliber to 5.56mm. You are welcome!
---
You,might have messed up something because my number adds up correctly.
---
For gatling plasma I have
---
72 base, 20% should be 14.
---
if I add the 3 +20% perks card I have: 86,101,115.
---
+15% for bloody mess  gives 10.8
---
and the total is 126.
---
It's exactly: 72*(1+0.2+0.2+0.2+0.15)
---
However, they have edited hundreds of effects for all weapon and buff so we will find bugs for sure.
---
Thanks man, you‚Äôre a legend. I‚Äôll definitely add you when I next log on. Would appreciate the help and the company!  My username is FameSpear so keep an eye out üòé Thanks again man
---
What is rule 6!?
---
That was me at level 12 lmfao.
---
Thank you for letting me know!üòÅ Is there anything I might need to know when it comes to equipping it and stuff? Like do I need to carry it in my mind inventory before I can put it on or will I just need to be carrying fusion cores to be able to wear it straight away?
---
Well i am too, my name on 76 is pushinnuggets 
---
Your welcome to join me in the wasteland any time!
---
You've done a huge amount of work here, and I really commend you for it, but I don't think that changing my playstyle to include always sneaking (3 new perks) and power attacking (which I never do) is a 'small change'. 
---
I think any players who are not Commando/Heavy Gunners are going to be disappointed in their builds after the next patch. It's not about numbers (though it hurts to see 349 damage on a deathclaw gauntlet when you've properly specced for it), it does feel different. It doesn't feel rewarding any more. 
---
I also have to say that 9 ranks in Slugger only increased my weapon damage from like 450-500. Is that worth 9 perk points?? 
---
I do more damage with the Gauss shotgun with no perks just because it's bloodied, which is so dang odd.
---
Didn‚Äôt mean to say ‚Äòmy mind inventory‚Äô just ‚Äòmy inventory‚Äô lol
---
Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope have this replace their normal animations when under the effects of Strange in Numbers. Either or both.
---
AP don't matter as much when you are doing so much damage. Might change when damage calculation is adjusted
---
I‚Äôll send a request now. üëç
---
In an ideal world, they should just get rid of the armor scrip values of 3, 9 and 24. Make then 5, 10 and 20/25. 
---
Lost count how many times i quickly scripped some crappy armor, then realised i've hit 148 or 149 for the day.
---
Bow has awesome vats accuracy if it doesn't glitch. That 300+ range ain't for nothing
---
Good idea. The purveyor sale sucks because I just get overloaded with legendaries I can‚Äôt do anything with because I don‚Äôt have stash or carry space.
---
Although I hate the term..... get gud applies in this instance.
---
After the three three star weapons-
---
Two two star weapons usually does it for me to get my daily scrip.  
---
six one star weapons as an alternative if I've been doing events a lot  
---
Armor is always a pain in the butt to calculate such atrocious scrip numbering  
---
so i just sell all legendary armor pieces on my vending machines
---
I'd just be happy to not have the workshop bug out and lie to me. Shows unowned on the map, you travel there, clear it out, try to claim, only for tge game to suddenly say you are stealing it from someone.  Check the map, still unclaimed,  but workbench still shows owned. So now I gotta try to find a place to hide while it maybe puts me in pvp. Most of the times the person isn't even logged in.
---
Have you got the 3 dome keys? Did that yesterday, as likewise, I'm running outta things to do on my main. So I'm trying to do all the unmarked quests I've missed and get any plans I'm missing before Season 2 kicks off.
---
I just go to a private server for those.
---
Another Dad here, I'm not in the UK but I'm happy to run with you if our sessions clash. PSN is Brankinstein if you want to add me. Dad's gotta look out for each other ‚úå
---
I had a very similar experience with Destiny 2. Never played destiny 1 and didn‚Äôt pick it destiny 2 until it had been out for 2 years and was on game pass. Instantly fell in love and was playing all day everyday. After about 6 months once I had all the exotic weapons and armors and had completed all the raids on regular and prestige the game just felt empty. Like I was logging into work to do dailies and weeklys not for fun. Anyways about 3 weeks ago I left it for 76 and have been loving this game since. But I‚Äôm sure eventually I‚Äôll hit the same wall with this lol sadly that‚Äôs gaming each one will only take you so far
---
I agree, I stumbled across a bunch of guys doing a defend workshop mission, I was level 20 and they were level 300 or there abouts. I did what I could with my best guns but I wasn‚Äôt really any help.
---
Afterwards they all dropped me meds and ammo, seriously helped me out at the time. Think they just thought ‚Äúaww bless him for trying‚Äù lmao!
---
Also recently after having to restart from scratch (hackers suck) I went to lewisham to do the mistress of mystery quest, got attacked by level 60 Wendigo and a bunch of glowing ghouls, also like level 60.
---
 Ended up marooned on a rooftop, completely outgunned and outta meds etc.
---
Absolute gent, of a level 160, with bad ass power armour runs up and spends a good 10 mins killing everything so I could get down, drops a bag, waves at me then dips.
---
I come down and check the bag. Full of meds, ammo, and a Gatling gun.
---
This game is full of bros and hero‚Äôs. Love it!
---
I can build you any pa that you want and put calibrated shocks etc on for you if that helps you or if your a rifleman i can make you a few level appropriate fixers?
---
Wolfe stein was don back in the day
---
I put them all up for the same price and they all go really quick. Violet is used for ultracitr 5.56 so I'd expect that to be popular
---
I havnt actually. I suppose I'll take a stroll over that direction and pick up the quest. I havnt discovered the location yet so at least it will be some new sights
---
We need akimbo first
---
I really wnat Bethesda to continue with the interloper story
---
Those are some good points. Thanks for taking the time to reply.
---
Power armour in this game works more like fallout three and new Vegas than in 4 
---
You put the power armour pieces on a power frame, then carry the frame in your inventory - you can place the frame at any time to use the power armour 
---
Power armour costs fusion cores to operate (same as fallout 4)
---
They are getting rid of building and changing casuals bounse to int
---
Some kind of nuke event is what I'm assuming. Probably nukes auto launching at different areas/get loot from said areas. (It 'could' be possible. No one knows for certain though)
---
They have the exact same base damage when modded. But the pf has a bit more armour pen making it better
---
Is that different than max fireproof that already  said he has?
---
My suggestions still stand.
---
and after the achievements update that you have all the logs and journals you still have to go talk to the robot outside of vault 76 before the overseer will accept you turning them in.
---
Lol my bad.. didn‚Äôt see he had written that. In that case nope
---
That's just mean. Who goes upstairs after you finish the Crane quest? What other secrets are there?
---
Will do!
---
&amp; as always,thanks Russ
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be able to do what I do,without friends like you!
---
Much appreciated!
---
Thanks mate, I‚Äôm level 21 and finding it more of a grind then I did last time, plus I keep running into high level monsters and I didn‚Äôt have that issue last play through. Not to the same extent anyway. 
---
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated my friend. When I‚Äôm high enough level to be any use, lol, I will help you guys out in return! 
---
Love this games community!
---
Thanks mate, I‚Äôll accept it on my phone in a second but I won‚Äôt be on till later most likely. Whenever we are both in together would be awesome to team up
---
You do realise some people that have ammo factories don‚Äôt actually want them. There were some people going around inviting players to a private team then placing ammo factories as a griefing method. They can‚Äôt be deleted unless you move your camp and a lot of people are unwilling to do that.
---
Thanks man, dads definitely need to stick together. I will add you soon as I can. Appreciate the offers of help from all of you.
---
Also where about a are you? USA?
---
Some people go around placing them in other peoples camps and they can‚Äôt be deleted. It‚Äôs not always intentional.
---
Just had another look at the roadmap, completely forgot about that part. Sounds interesting, wonder if it's anything to do with BoS opposing 76ers frequent nuking.
---
Never mind... I restarted the game and run the analysis BEFORE fitting the fuse (like that'd work IRL üòÇ) then fitted the fuse after.
---
You can suggest whatever you want :)
---
I don't think that there is any chance that you'll be heard, even less of one that your suggestions will be implemented, no matter the timeframe.
---
Beth does some changes on the grouping, and that will be that.
---
Can we get bow vats fixed? Always missing the first hit is quite a problem.
---
I had roughly 1200 script handed in during this sale. The amount of weapons I have 'binned for cash' has been an utter joke. I had no real choice as my stash was full and so was my secondary character. We all earn script doing events/daily what ever and they screw us over by this limit. Really rustles my jimmies.
---
Man this system is messy.. this wiki says the base damage at lvl 50 is 58, another one says it's 48... note it is still pre patch 22 there.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gatling_plasma
---
My be90 has a base damage of 77 without perks or bloodied, but the explosive should have more increase then 5damage...
---
Thx. I'll test it
---
My sneak set up works with just one piece of harder to detect and sneak perks in ACP. They've sorted what the majority asked for when it came to public groups. I always find people doing events when I join an events team, literally no other reason to be in an events team unless you're doing events. We have perks that give us the bonuses you want so it's kind of pointless asking for something we already have... Just saying.
---
Nah I'm in Sydney. GMT +10. It's a long shot, but hopefully we run into each other.
---
Congrats, you beat the game! What keeps me going is trying new builds on new characters. I have 3 favourites: a pistol build, heavy, and commando.
---
Building a 4th character now that will have no mutations or addictions as the ultimate BoS brown noser :)
---
160 would line up well for armor too, as 5√ó24 is 120, leaving you exactly 40 for your 3* legendary weapon.
---
Just do the event a few more times and you'll get the hang of it without having to track down hard to find armor pieces.  First few times I died a lot.  Now I either don't die at all or a max of 2 times per event without asbestos lining or any other special equipment/perks.
---
Just learn when to put some distance between you and Earle to avoid his screams.  All of my deaths now come from running into hazards when he does get me with it.
---
No problem at all mate my psn is Rayman130878, i can make any serums you need also so just give me a shout with what you need üëç
---
Always looking to get some good gear for my friends. Thanks op
---
A new character is an option I guess. Would certainly do it better second time around. Not sure I have the urge to do it yet though. Perhaps in the future if there was an expansion I would start from scratch and know I have loads of new content in the future to look forward to. I think I just miss quests. Events are fun but it's no replacement for a good story. A new build is something I might think about in a few weeks if I find myself missing the game too much
---
They do have an option for this - switch servers after it's claimed. Or like the guy above, I just do these challenges on a private server.
---
Only raiders is available to wear at lv 15, but yes you can find all levels of power armor all over the wasteland. Watoga has 3 + 1 at nearby west big bend
---
I'm level 36 and wandered into a quest at Big Bend accidentally so, what the hell, I tagged along.  I was way out of my depth, the others were around level 200, killing enemies with one shot where my gun was as effective as a peashooter!
---
Anyway, I saw a cry for help, the leader was down so I made my way over and Stimpacked him.  Afterwards he dropped me 40 fusion cores as a thank you! Whaaattt!!!
---
I joined his team for a while, he would draw out high level enemies, let me take a few shots so I could gain some XP and loot before he finished them off, but couldn't keep up with him as the cores had over-encumbered me.  I gave him 30 back, and just before he quit he dropped me a 3 star legendary pistol.  I can't remember your name but thank you for your kindness to a newbie!
---
I'm on Xbox .and I appreciate the offer but ill be ok I'll just grind and get good lol thanks though
---
No problem. I‚Äôm usually on in the evenings. üëç
---
Server has to be laggy.
---
I dont do quests while leveling to 50+ on any of my new builds, instead I just use my knowledge to speed level and perfect them. Then you get to enjoy your maxed new build and this gives variety for end game content.
---
Bloodied. Still does double junkies damage
---
Ad on
---
Its been there a few months at least. Since I started playing some time after Wastlander hit.
---
Even after the nerf?
---
&gt; Perma ban exploiters
---
To boil it down, that would in the end mean that bugged game functions are the reason people get excluded from playing, yes?
---
So you need to come up where to draw the line.
---
An exploit can be as simple as making a new char and have it join all the events and thus "discovering" all those places which he shouldn't have.
---
While this exploit doesn't hurt anybody, it's still an exploit, using the game's mechanics to further one's own char.
---
How about the fast-reload exploit? You want now people banned because they use an item that was given as a reward?
---
Those are just 2 of the obvious exploits in this game where banning, instead of Beth fixing bugs is asinine.
---
Back to your post, you are actually calling for a ban on player that use guns as they are intended to be used, that have not been hacked or tampered with. That is asinine.
---
I agree that hacked weapons and their users should be banned, but not those players that use guns that Beth fucked up.
---
One thing that's nice about that is that plasma cores are pretty easy to craft; no flux or other rare materials necessary. And while they're not nearly as plentiful as fusion cores (and you can't farm them at power plant workshops), there is still a decent number scattered throughout the game.
---
Bandaided
---
Or me when i saw a over encumbered high level in power armor and thought he was out of fusion cores. So i dropped him a 25/100 core.
---
The timer counts up from when you start and you get rewards based on the time you took.  The initiate (lowest) tier is 16 minutes, which is easily achievable even for a solo player. You can immediately retry, and replay as many times as you like.
---
If you're alluding to the damage changes, you've been misinfomed. If bloodied is getting nerfed, all buiilds are proportionately so bloodied won't shift its position in the meta.
---
If you mean just theoretically, it's the next cab on rank - Junkies.
---
Ok thanks
---
I always found that hilarious
---
It‚Äôs back on PS4 as of last week. I used the two door trick a few days ago building my new camp. I got it to work by starting with contemporary walls door piece and then in edit mode changing it to any type of wall I know the plans for. There are some videos on YouTube showing how do do this.
---
Thanks have that and nerd rage. Guess its jump shots then.
---
Is instigating get nerfed? I run bloodied sneak with instigating Fixer and Hunting Rifle, allows me to one shot most any standard enemies.
---
Not that I know of I think you are ok I was just worried about the amount damage output bloodied builds would have after the upcoming nerf
---
Lol bro i‚Äôm selling these shits for like 1-5 caps each I got too many and they sell like hot cakes. the power armors like 25 and everybody wants the sweet sweet ultracite especially the new players
---
200 watch the video again
---
10minutes? Must have been 200 enemy's at least then.
---
Hopefully it's not too bad. As another commenter stated, if it's DR nerfed across the board, the Bloody should still be meta
---
A seven year old shouldn't be playing a restricted game
---
Melee weapons aren‚Äôt magic ya idiot
---
Ye
---
Yea heres some real damave numbers from the PTS.
---
Bloodied does double damage as junkies. AA does 5% less than junkies. AA should do more damage to earl/SBQ than junkies.

---
The negative press regarding the game was very very much warranted. By press I mean actually press, not some random arsehole on a soapbox. Some of those guys go overboard.
---
If you were around during the early days, you'd know this to be the case. Things are different of late.
---
Also that emptiness you're feeling... welcome to Fallout 76's end game.
---
Please don't confuse hacker with duper.
---
Duped weapons are hard to control, hacked ones not so much.
---
Both are available for real money, yes. As long as gear is not account or char bound, this selling/buying will happen in any game. There is a whole industry around this.
---
As for the point... I don't care if someone buys his gear. Simply because I play for me and I don't need to compare epenis. All my gear was earned by me. And that's what I am aiming for.
---
So others can one-shot the SBQ and Earl. Do I care? No, why should I?
---
Both events are imho just a time sink anyways and don't further my play in any way.
---
Aw shucks, I was going to ask if you were on PC when I found you were on the xbox. Anyways, I wish you all the best, and hope you find some good friends here!
---
Fireproof rank3 and two pieces of armor with acid resistance.
---
Hmm and what about the 20 3star ss armor pieces that we don't like
---
I dropped some level 5s a radaway and stimpacks once at Flatwoods... I only realised after they marsupial jumped away from me that a higher level had probably  given them serums further up the map and that my radaway was going to cure the mutation. I‚Äôll hand out Nuka Grapes to high jumping low levels in future
---
Lol nah, the enemies were just all around the town, like you know how ghouls are asleep or standing still (kinda glitched) and they come alive when you get close, plus the Wendigo and a bunch of raiders, he basically wiped out the town for me so I could GTFO
---
its more about youre character build and youre legendary effects
---
heavy weapons are powerfull and the most popular choices are either Bloodied or junkies ones with either explosive or faster fire rate.
---
That beeing said, those weapons are very expensive and a lot of players dont want to follow a strict build.
---
If youre just casually playing there are some effects that are cheaper to get and dont require any perks or addictions to benefit you.
---
Furious or anti armor ones give you a solid overall damage boost with now downside and they are way easier to get your hands on.
---
There is even an AA/FFR .50cal machine gun thats a fixed reward for a questline so that might be a good starting point for you üëçüèº
---
Good job, looks awesome! Love looking at peoples camps cos it gives you inspiration
---
Armor with acid resistance? is that even a thing? You mean poison?
---
Sounds like you got a magic weapon, mate. ;)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs)
---
Rumor has it that instigating will still do double damage.
---
And on the PTS I tried it with a inst HM, still did twice the damage on the first two shots.
---
Sorry it took me long to answer but TheSnark repplied. In containers they won't disappear.   :)
---
Yh man, I just started the sheep squatch quest line and it‚Äôs sick. Always love the creepy mystery type quests in fallout games. 
---
Who remembers the house in Salem in FO4? With the deathclaw, not cryptid but awesome none the less
---
Asbestos lining will make you immune to the falling embers inside. I feel like he spits acid and poison. I use asbestos then put on first aid rank 3. I‚Äôll use some stims but the only time i die is when he kicks me in the face.
---
I never lock anything at workshops so less reason to take over
---
I‚Äôm xbox too! I‚Äôm quite happy to visit you some time and run some events to get you up to speed! -TeJediSlug
---
Well known bug, around since beta.
---
Final Word is the absolute best quest reward in this game. Nothing comes even close to it. :)
---
Oh. I was wondering about the falling debris. Thanks man. Do I need asbestos on all pieces?
---
It really covers the 'emptyness and the time you knew never comes back' vibe
---
+karma
---
true i cant think of any other reward thats really as good
---
‚ÄúDo you want a magic gun that shoots bad man with Jesus lightning‚Äù
---
No, asbestos will be on your chest only.
---
Does that still work? I myself can never do it somehow
---
‚ÄúSo you want a magic gun that shoots bad man with Jesus lightning!‚Äù
---
It needs to set some limits though, I can easily acquire 1000's of scrip a day when playing. It would be very unfair to people who can only jump on a few hours a week. Not to mention it would destroy what's left of the broken economy.
---
I fully agree yeah, I dont think I've ever ran out using the gatling plasma, even having to craft ultracite cores for the prime version
---
Especially with ammosmith and super duper it's pretty easy to uphold ammo
---
Plus you dont have to burn through the ammo so quick cause of the extra damage the weapon does
---
Is there a good guide on where exactly to find them all ? I know the Main story kinda guides you but i missed one already and just found it while doing random stuff.
---
If you‚Äôre not using any energy weapons then you might as well go for it. Although since your a stealth commando you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about extra energy resistance as you won‚Äôt take damage nearly as much in stealth.
---
It's a magic weapon, enjoy it while it lasts
---
Great, because the Forest Camo Jumpsuit wasn't hard enough to find in the first place
---
Update - definitely Instigating , without min maxing just using perks I got upto over 2000 damage on ghouls, the AA also killed most with 1 hit but with about 800 damage .
---
I like the genre so thats the drawcard ,but i most love the immersion , i might be partially baked i play no fast traveling , and no lookin at the map and just play as it comes , thats where i get the most out of the experience , and more random encounter in an unbroken chain, i have a theory that the rng resets when u fast travel around to every location ,  works for me none the less
---
[Whatever could you mean?](https://imgur.com/a/ABgXmPy)
---
Thanks so much I‚Äôll look into it!
---
I guess you wont have slots left in perception anyway if you are a commando build. So i d take the mutation if you dont use energy weapons

---
No, why do you ask?
---
I‚Äôve watched it it‚Äôs awesome. Jeremy Cornell made it based on George Knapps book he wrote.
---
Highly recommend Bob Lazar, Area 51 and Flying Saucers too
---
This is an elegant solution. BGS still gets to time gate, we get rid of our scrip fodder. Boom.
---
What are you on about? It sucks having to start over, but it‚Äôs not like the game sucks. 
---
How do you not see my point?
---
I had to dump so much armor ontop of the pervayer stash box because I couldn't keep or scrip it...
---
Good luck!;)......... Rnr10 monster coming:/
---
Yes! I played for 10 mins yesterday and now I can't do any more quests or even play the game until I can trade in more legendaries. Half price weekend is great but if we are to make the most of it, we can't actually play the game due to stash and inventory limits.
---
I play at weird times cos of my shift pattern so may well catch you on there at some point mate. Will add you definitely, thanks for the offer
---
Awesome cheers mate. Will add you in a sec! Appreciate the assitance
---
I see your point but your post just seems like you are begging.
---
Armor is even worse, just get rid of the limits!
---
Then it looks the same as any other
---
Melee and rifle, luck build could work as a combo.
---
I‚Äôm not begging for anything? Was looking for help grinding Xp or any tips for grinding Xp etc, or...heaven forbid, like minded players In my area I can play with.
---
Thankfully most people have been complete bros, always at least one troll tho....
---
The only issue I see with being able to abandon a workshop voluntarily would be in those cases where your challenge is to take over multiple workshops, if you could abandon and then take over immediately again it would break the challenge.  
---
The game could force a cool down period on any player who abandons a workshop to say they can't claim that workshop for at least 2 hours, or a bit more drastic if you abandon a workshop you can't claim any other workshop for at least 1 hour, have the cool down on the player and it prevents server hopping as well.
---
So what youre saying is my other weapon, a junkie's explosive .50 cal, is ALSO gonna be defunct at some point.  
---
Dammit.
---
Do you think you're still funny still?
---
I call bull
---
This is wholesome as hell, i wish I had scrip to hand you.
---
Yesterday he and chalky were busy kicking the crap out a legendary sheepsquatch.
---
There you go, I'm wrong again, lol.
---
I use a bloodied 44 on my unarmed build, it's good enough to pop turrets and agro bat's.
---
Yes it is. Also you're not Brotherhood material.
---
You mean the 10mm pistol isn't enough?
---
But duping is fair!??? All the major duper are thriving, billionaires in the economy. And all Beth does is saying bad player go take penalty round and 10 push-ups.
---
Thank you for the help I‚Äôll probably keep using my PF until the new update drops and then figure it out
---
Not for a second saying it is, but one is exploiting and bad game engine the other is creating a bad game mechanic. 
---
Bethesda should have done more about the duping yes but on the plus side I know own 20+ legacies from trading.
---
I have the plans for all of those, even Elder T60 skin. Could make them for you if you like. Probably need the flux though. PS4 though?
---
Same situation but a little higher level 144 I think Xbox here CountryRdsWV feel free to add me
---
I was playing around launch. Dropped it after hitting 80+ with three characters. 
---
Returned just about two weeks before wastelanders hit in order to get my wife into the fallout series (she specifically wants to play multiplayer so I can help her for now) and after wastelanders, the game finally feels complete. We‚Äôve both soared past level 70 already, and about the only thing that keeps us going is exploring new places, doing a LOT of side quests, and finding cool and unusual spots to build our camps.
---
I am almost üíØ sure I have another magic weapon I'll give you for nothing man
---
Thanks man, do you have the plans for sale?
---
With the limited number of perk cards you can have active, youll want to focus on one type of weapon there. Thats not to say you cant have support weapons, you just dont have room for damage boost cards at the same time (later you can swap cards in and out).  
---
For example, theres shotgunner, rifleman, commando,pistol, bow cards, youll want to concentrate on one vs 1 of each.
---
Some cards like bloody mess apply to all/most weapons and youll want them regardless.
---
My cards are setup around commando + stealth, but i still use a silenced hunting/lever rifle from a distance, and shotgun up close if the situation warrants, but my auto rifle is where my damage perk cards are setup, as that can more quickly pump out the most damage and is more versatile for me. Although chews through ammo.
---
Bloodied is not getting nerfed.  All weapons are getting a recalculation in damage.  Bloodied will still be the strongest.
---
I am the same way as you lol if you want an equally terribly built character to play with, you‚Äôre more than welcome to add me jesicarandiemai and we can run out of ammo together in the wasteland hahaha
---
Empath does not give you more damage, it mitigates incoming damage only.
---
AT's video clearly states this.
---
The truth is yes, but the real answer is no. While bethesda MAY have a way to track dupes (all they have to do is slap a unique origin ID on the backend) the fact is so many people have dupes now that many have obtained legitimately (vendors, trades, picking up off the ground etc) that they risk banning a huge amount of thier player base.  Best they can do at this point is go after dupers not the recipients.  Even magically removing duped weapons from the game would be a huge mistake because of the same reason (legitimate players scrapping up savings / trades for duped weapons would be devastated). It's a tricky problem.
---
Lookup ‚Äútanagra town farming‚Äù or ‚Äúglassed caverns farming‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôm at the point where I feel like I have nothing left to do. I don‚Äôt want to play a game forever. 
---
Sure I could grind for more gold bullion, and there‚Äôs still going to be the legendary run season 2, but I‚Äôm happy that I get a short break - I don‚Äôt want to get burnt out on this game
---
Yeah I am hop scotching around sneaking so I don't run into a glowing rad scorpion.
---
I was a little disappointed there's not an option to tell Maggie her dad's at your camp if you have the rug.
---
There is some evidence to suggest that different servers have higher chances of different legendary effects.
---
Only if you are in melee range.
---
Wonder why
---
üòÇ that would be brutal.
---
Yes, but after next pach it's going to woth 15 scrip, so use it while you can
---
Mkay
---
Happens quite frequent.   Glass cavern this happens a lot.
---
Its pretty clear
---
So they gonna fix it
---
Ok, but don't complain when you get pvp'd because you were warned prior
---
100%of the perfect roll top tier weapons you have are dupers works. Would think I know a bit of drop chance after thousand up on thousand legendary drops after more than 3000 hours game play. Is it fair for players that don't have such duped weapons like you?
---
whats funny is I play a medic power armor build and forget I have rad sponge and healing hands when bloody builds join they get so confused and salty when I stimpak revive them healing all rads by accident
---
You're the sad little fucker, fucktard. I offered help, you fucking cunt. Get fucked,  you incel cunt.
---
Not OP but for me Fallout 1st was a game changer. Suddenly I could go back to playing Fallout 76 like I did all the other Fallout games. I explored every corner and I picked up EVERYTHING. I could go back to hoarding like any good to honest Bethesda player should.  No more micro inventory management etc. Also another huge selling point was I was getting atoms on the cheap. Lastly, the private servers. Love being able to chill with just my friends if we want to and it offers a safe place for us to do trades via drops.
---
I agree. I just received this and it's a great weapon!
---
Thank you for the answer. So you should prioritize weapon perks (after general ones like bloody mess)? Because i've heard a few people say that only the first level of each is worth it because of the diminishing returns (10% lvl1, 15% lvl2 etc.).
---
I tried a medic commando but the range on the medics legendary effect meant that I'd effectively need to be sitting on the shoulders of each team mate to heal them.
---
Maybe one day, but on the pts they still wreck.
---
I would prioritize first level of each, but if you take all, thats +60% instead of +30%. But does chew up 9 cards. 
---
Note you cant get expert/master cards until higher level, so that needs to factor into your build.
---
That's not true, I dont doubt for a second that some of my legacies where duped however I have dropped some amazing weapons from the purveyor and enemies. Even new players can get god roll weapon drops. They are rare but they do happen. 
---
Its all about learning the market place and knowing what items to collect. I spend an hour a day vendor hopping, looking for players selling items well below the market value  then trade those towards nice gear I need. 
---
I have never duped though, and duped items make up less than 1% of my valuable items
---
Try out different options on the build planner, https://nukesdragons.com/ to see how the numbers come out. Or lookup different build types.
---
Wait what? Thats the first time ive heard that you need to actually use said legendary bonus to procc the magic effect, is that really the case, or am i misunderstanding something?
---
Worst feeling staring down that single bit of scrip you just can't get.
---
I drowned in The Lucky Hole Mine. There‚Äôs a few places with deep water and no air pockets.
---
You're absolutely correct! Long live the proletariat regime!
---
I think it‚Äôs the Beckett quest right?
---
If you are interested in bloodied build shotgunner and in PC, I have a Bloodied Explosive Vats 25%  Double-barrel shotgun for you as a gift. Not an ending-game weapon but may help you with some tough guys before you got gauss shotgun.
---
DM me if you have interest. It's all a free gift for new player without any future charge.
---
There's a teacher in my school names Me. Conley, I thought you might be him
---
&gt;I'm guessing it's to encourage new playstyles, but that is really not a great way to do it.
---
its to see if they can loose more then 50% of playerbase after this patch :V
---
Thanks give that a try.
---
You are not using the effect actively per se, bashing damage is added to each bullet and that bug is triggered when you are in range.
---
I'm dtb7591 on PSN. Send me a request and I'll help where I can
---
Yea the same workshop claiming cool down is a great idea.
---
How about when anyone who wants to claim a workshop occupied by someone else, they claim the workshop and a notification is sent to the owner "Another PLAYER is claiming your workshop" and then the owner gets to choose whether to defend or abandon the workshop, currently you only get notified of an attack, if they choose to defend, then PvP starts, they could even throw PvPers a bone and say that the PvP is world wide so you wouldn't even have to just fight in the workshop but anywhere on the map for it to count.  
---
The big issue with the workshop for pacifist players, is that there is no choice to just give up the workshop, everytime i've experienced PvP at a workshop it's been a hidden player who blindsides you, not once has another player strode into the workshop and done the guns emote, if they did i'd wave goodbye and run away lol.
---
I've had Ammosmith maxed for a while, but I literally just put Super Duper on. I wish I'd done it sooner.
---
The other thing is that with Batteries Included, you can carry around an asston of cores of either type. Part of the reason that I don't put FCs in my vendors is that they take up so little room in my inventory vs what they would in my stash.
---
exactly :)
---
You're right on the money.
---
They get away with this because people are still giving them money in spite of it. The fact that people maintain monthly fees on a full price AAA game that's in this shape, says there is no hope. This is why, as a society, we can't have nice things.
---
It‚Äôs related to the world loot refresh/respawn. You have to collect a certain amount of loot for loot you‚Äôve already collected to respawn.
---
Bash damage does magic on a Minigun from a distance, although not as apparent if you are beyond the guns default range of \~200, or \~130 with an accelerated barrel. No need for VATS or being in melee range.
---
Which dev talk?
---
Most players got Magic weapons without even knowing...
---
Level 45 is the max level for some weapons.
---
 That‚Äôs the max level for some weapons
---
Also, you don't drop your junk if you die at a Public Event.
---
Poison resist protects you from acid
---
45 is the max for some weapons, if all your getting is level 45s you are either really lucky or your luck sucks depends on your viewpoint
---
How about a limit of 200 then you could scrip 5 üëçüèª
---
Could use some help with gear
---
I don‚Äôt blindside you, even if I‚Äôm well within my rights to. I contest it, and give the owner a chance to run or gun. If they don‚Äôt run and stay or shoot me, I will shoot them. Oftentimes when I take a workshop I fully intend to use it.
---
Yes plz.
---
Level us soft capped at 50 so max item level is either 45 or 50.
---
Take my free award bro, I‚Äôm also a single father to a little boy:) noticed you‚Äôre on Xbox? I think I‚Äôm level 95/96 
---
Fancy playing sometime? Shoot me a dm:)
---
It‚Äôs not a nerf to bloodied...
---
I have a combined rifleman/heavy weapons build so I had to concentrate my perk points into Strength (15) and Perception (12) to max out the damage perk cards. I love playing with heavy weapons but also wanted the nimble, stealth experience of a rifleman. You do lose some optimizations because of the loss of perk points in other Specials but it's worth it for the increased fun factor. Of course, it would be tedious switching the perk cards for the respective builds but I am on PC and use the perk loadout mod so it's just a matter of a single key press.
---
The game should have it where we can only spend a certain amount of scrip a day but we can earn as much as we want, that way we don‚Äôt need vouchers and we still get rid of the legendaries in our stash boxes.
---
So. Now you've probably scripped what are actually Max level legendaries- what did you lose? ;)
---
The change is rather than multiplying the damage from the perk cards they are adding them to the base damage of the equipped weapon. Everything will feel weaker. Bloody got hit harder due to all of the multipliers being used.     It is still the strongest build.
---
Most people are staying bloodied as it still is the highest dmg still after the nerf, I have heard however due to the weaponry getting nerfed too most people I've spoke about this are changing to commando builds due to the high fire rate compensating for the dmg loss
---
Its seems that framerate impact it... Fir example, the higher your framerate is, the lower rhe firerate will be needed
---
Lol I spent 100h+ on market too. All I see is; I have this want something much better, but after ever duping wave you can get perfect roll weapons that drop on average every 500-1000 hours for free. "Hi I just got this B2525 fixer after thousand hours playing the game and like to trade it away asap for slick;)"
---
I'm not gonna tell that I have like 60 right now. So many scrip during whole season 1.
---
Where?
---
How is this not top comment?no reinstall until limits are removed simple as that
---
There's always at least 1 that's for sure. Your post didn't seem like begging at all... the game is built to play in teams, and it's hard to find people to play with when you work and have a family. You have to reach out in places like this.
---
I guess I don't have a lot, lol üòÜ ü§£üòÇ
---
Yeah on my main character I lug around all my cores - and with fusion cores especially you can get the perk which increases its duration 
---
on my secondary character I carry hundreds of missiles cause the weight reduction is so good *with the respective perks for them obviously* - shame it doesnt carry over to stashes. 
---
Bear arms is a lifesaver for big guns can just walk about with a ton of heavy weapons.
---
I run the game on average 90-144fps at home and 40-60fps from work and never noticed any difference with my inst limb minigun...
---
&gt;"sneak to do more damage"
---
keep in mind you cant sneak in daily ops :V
---
I had to drop so much armor on the pervayer's stash box because I couldn't scrip or carry it!
---
It also doesn't work if you are the only Empath. As people keep thinking.
---
Hunters, Exterminators and Nocturnal crap, mostly. I did get a Furious Explosive lever-action rifle, which I will keep.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of a good handmade, scripped.
---
Ah yeah, my bad.
---
I don‚Äôt have instigating or bloodied but still one shot normal enemies with headshots on those weapons in sneak so I imagine you‚Äôll be fine.
---
Tents can stack fairly close it seems, whereas CAMPS are bullshit wide imo.
---
Basically anywhere near top of the world, rusty pick, foundation, wayward and the common as fuck nodes is just a 'do the server dance' for anyone who decides to build there. Not too many near Crater I've noticed...
---
But you have a 209 firerate on this weapon, so you wont see any diff√©rence.
---
But there is a heavy gun that goes up to 189 firerate with FFR (cant remeber which) that some players got magic effect with and some dont.
---
I do the same. Gamma rounds is the least they deserve.
---
Sell it. Even if you have full unyielding its a waste of special stats to add junky. Also bloodied gains more dps then juunky effect, so double no.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Same as the current best build. Full health heavy gunner, no power armor tank.
---
Of you're already a shotgunner you should already have all the required perks, Shotgunners, Enforcer, Skeet Shooter... The only additional one to the shotgunner cards is Demo expert as all Gauss weapons are inherently explosive now.
---
What he means is the damage protection drops off after a certain level.
---
I have full vanguards on one character and a mixture of Armour on another .. I don‚Äôt notice a difference,  in fact it‚Äôs easier to get decent SS Armour using a mixture for example I have some lifesaving , some bolstering some regenerating .. all with useful 2nd &amp; 3rd stars 
---
By using mods I can still get around 500 DR without vanguards
---
45 and 50 are both max level. Depends on the weapon.
---
Why do you think that‚Äôs better than the current bloodied builds?
---
Still looks ugly as fuck.
---
I can't imagine anyone wanting to use a high-vis helmet when they want to hide.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. I picked that up as we because I knew that. I was looking for perks outside of the basics for shotguns that synergize well with the Gauss Shotgun in particular, I suppose.
---
&gt; keep running into high level monsters and I didn‚Äôt have that issue last play through. 
---
This should be resolved in the next one wasteland patch.
---
It's likely you are hitting this due to more high levels - causing higher level enemies to spawn.
---
But again - next patch does fix that
---
I was making a joke because It‚Äôs what I run and I‚Äôve had bloody builds kick me from public teams and tell me I‚Äôm playing the game wrong.
---
then i just never noticed, ive been running down to the fire station every. single. time... lol
---
Again, the damage calculation is serverside (otherwise we would be able to manipulate it with ease) and doesn't tied to clients performance.
---
A lot of the people complaining don't understand true greifing in this game. Been playing since beta as well and remember a time when someone contested your workshop and could hunt you down across the map to kill you and destroy your camp.
---
Even if they aren't willing to change the limits, change into a weekly one.
---
I'm a relative noob, but I've noticed that you choose a special to put the point on then the perks come up after. If I press RB/LB I can pick a perk from a different special but the point goes on the initial selection before the perk choice.  Does that make sense?
---
Initially I was levelling intelligence and picking perks from a different category and had a few spare int with no perks and plenty of other perks without the points to use them
---
Oh that‚Äôs wrong play how you want to i say
---
Thanks man, did think that was what this sub was for lmao! I just want people to okay with to make the grind more fun more than anything. I‚Äôd don‚Äôt even care if they are low level like me really. Appreciate all you guys comments and offers of help. I‚Äôll add you all
---
I'm not singling any individual's out, as I said in every instance of this happening to me it has always been a blind side attack with no warning and no option to withdraw.  I respect that individual players play to their own styles/ethics even their own roleplay character styles, they are choices that individuals make. 
---
The Pacifist Mode however is a game mechanic, that was introduced to allow players to deliberately avoid PvP while playing the game, and the introduction of claiming workshops as part of the score challenges has negated that mechanic for that specific instance.  
---
I'm not saying remove PvP from workshops, it has value in the game for players with a different play style than my own, I just believe players who have chosen Pacifist Mode should have an option to abandon the workshop before PvP can start.
---
What do you mean they wouldn‚Äôt add?
---
If they went to the ‚Äúwrong special‚Äù it‚Äôs because you chose to do that. When leveling up you first select the SPECIAL and then the card. If you chose strength and then on the card select screen to a different category it will increase strength and give you the card you want. I agree the UI is wonky. To fix it, just do the opposite next time- increase the category you want and select a card from
---
The category you accidentally increased last time. 
---
At level 50 you can reallocate SPECIAL points.
---
If you are already a shotgunner try to run with an explosive shotgun before you start using the Gauss... it takes some getting used to , and a bit of tweaking of perks and Armour .. when you get it set up properly it‚Äôs awesome ...
---
Yeah, I was mostly leaning on selling it. Not only for stats consideration, but I'm already a disaster at managing my rads, imagine adding addictions on top of that.
---
What do you think a fair price would be? I was thinking 9-10k since the third roll is movement speed, nothing special.
---
Quite the age spread
---
Thanks man, appreciate the offer. Will add you when I can definitely. And emailing Bethesda is a really good shout, I will definitely give that a go, maybe they can help out. Cheers!
---
Oh shit. Very well done.
---
Wait... random number generator system is random? Tell me more...
---
Yes but if you are struggling to find nice weapons, surely you would be for duped items as they bring the costs down. You argument is confusing me a little. 
---
I do agree the market place is full of posts asking stupid things for stupid deals but there is some great deals to be had. Even before the last duping craze I traded a full responders outfit for a B/E/15FR laser rifle. The helmet I purchased from a player vendor for 50 caps and the outfit dropped as a reward for doing campfire tales for memory. 
---
I currently have 2 mules full of "god tier" gear that I will use for trading in the future if I see something I really want.

Fallout 76 Presents: How Not To Be Seen narrated by John Cleese
---
A dead or useless 3rd lower its value. I'm on pc and would sell it for 2,5-3k at my vendor. Idk how prices are on consoles.
---
This has been debunked. I don‚Äôt know why people keep spreading these lies.
---
Don‚Äôt bother, it‚Äôs been debunked. Only people who think it‚Äôs true suffer from
---
Confirmation bias.
---
The amount of charge. They can go above 100% so their value could go up, or down when below 100%. The math would get complicated
---
i mean no you are supposed to uninstall the game and wait for them to rewert this shit show :V
---
I've seen tents extremely close to each other during Line in the Sand which makes sense. I remember when Whitespring Station used to be the most contested spot... I was thinking of settling on Crater but the water turns into Toxic Water instead of Dirty Water when collected, to this date I'm not sure why collecting water from stream doesn't cause diseases but collecting from a pump does.
---
Heh imagine if Todd becomes a boss in this game. Would be something....but yeah I am a beta player and have played thousands of hours by now. Mostly on the xbox. I migrated to pc late last year. I wish character progress transferred. I miss my Bloody Explosive Gatling Gun a friend of mine gave me. Best gift ever. This player base is amazing. Keeps me going like no other game before it.
---
Vats in general is broken, not just bows
---
And both of us players that use bows are as fucked as we were to begin with. Noice.
---
Kind of dissapointed but alright
---
I van assure you that I experienced it not working in ar least 1 situation :  LAG induced by legacy weapons against the SBQ.
---
And there is one thing that you seem to miss : magic works if you shoot the same spot over and over again. Good luck doing that when you drop frames
---
Tis a shame some of these well valued emotes are coming this late. However they're coming so it's good i guess.
---
Thats legit. You can spend a special point and pick a card from another special, it is intended to work like this.
---
I'm on PC :) The high price was because I'm using price checker since I'm fairly new, wasn't expecting this much of a difference!
---
 
---
&gt;	can a generalist build (2 or 3 weapon types at the same time) work or will it be too underpowered compared to a build made to use only one type of weapon? 
---
The answer to both of these is yes. Yes it can work, and yes you will Be underpowered **compared to** someone who specs to one specific type. The two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.
---
Cancel the junkie one being made useless, It actually does normal damage most of the time, because it just one shotted a scorchbeast and that never happens, so I guess it is magic, but only like. 1% magic.
---
Yes ik how to play the game I'm saying it litterly would not add to the perk so I still have for example 1 intelligence
---
Not everyone claims their rewards immediately, so leaving the board up after the season end is good. Reason why someone may not claim immediately? Caps limit is one ... Some rewards are 2500 caps.
---
I personally love it. For me, it's private servers, and by private, I mean just me in the wasteland. I'm basically paying an extra $100/year so I can have access to Fallout as a single player game, the way god and nature intended. (What the hell was the point of Bethesda's "Save Player One" campaign when then turned right around and give a big middle finger to single player gamers with FO76?)
---
I still load into public servers for vendor activity and for some events. Most events I prefer to just do solo.
---
As another note about private servers - if you have multiple characters, I have always found private servers reliable for transferring items between them. Load character A into the server, put the stuff you want to transfer in a train station suitcase or whatever, exit and immediate load character B into a private world - you will return to the same server instance you just left, and the stuff is there in the suitcase. This is not an officially documented behavior, so YMMV, but it is has always worked for me.
---
Beyond getting away from the maddening crowd, the unlimited scrap (not unlimited junk, to be clear) box is great - and I assume it is only because of Fallout 1st players that the Building Atlas goals were achievable. If you don't have Fallout 1st you probably hadn't accumulated thousands, or tens of thousands, of various scrap resources, and could not possibly farm them in the two or three day windows of each type.
---
The survival tents are nice and give you another free fast travel point.  They also mean you can immediately dump your stable flux from the queen fight before you get killed by some scorched cave cricket you hadn't noticed in the grass.
---
You also get some free cosmetics in the Atom shop. Far, far fewer than I expected, but that wasn't a motivation in my purchase. It was 100% about becoming the Lone Wanderer again.
---
Also this video was uploaded before public teams were released.
---
Gt on Xbox is w024. Feel free
---
Yeah if you got it for 3k you did good.  I wouldn‚Äôt part with my 1 I got for any ammount or caps.   Maybe a b ffr 50 cal.  But that says something.  Lol
---
Why don‚Äôt you sell them... or give them to new players... or just stop grinding legendaries and do something else. Storage limits have to exist for stability. If you want no limits, don‚Äôt play an online multiplayer game with so many interactable objects.
---
I didnt even know there was a basement...
---
I run junkies and bloodied. If you tend to play in a team and run herd mentality you will barely notice a drop in your SPECIAL points.
---
Search for 'yabs guide junkies' to get a better idea of which addictions suit your build.
---
Skin available ‚Äòsoon‚Äô in atom shop.
---
There are at least 2 bugged out deposits in white springs that I‚Äôve used in the last week to farm well over 50 of each stable flux ingredient.  Wasn‚Äôt sure if they are always bugged or if it‚Äôs random.  Was just told about this myself a few weeks ago.
---
I done it last night, took 5 minutes for the whole run with it lol
---
Whenever I go to the terminal it's just a blank screen
---
Initializing or some shit
---
I still claim user error
---
Legacy weapons don't produce more lag then any other explosive guns, why should they? They are only legacy since beth don't want energy weapons as explosives since they aren't immersive.
---
Now you tell me the limbdamage on high fire rates dont work when you are not capable to aim? Wow.. slowclap... it doesn't work either with 20000 or 2 frames when you suck at aiming. This has nothing to do with the weapon, game or anything else, its more a user failure.
---
There are more "magic" major modifiers then limbdamage. Heck even armor can make every weapon insanely strong.
---
Is bloodied the best way to go? or are there other good gear combinations?
---
I still remember my first time too!  Great feeling of getting it done.   Now your off to the races launching one every time you log on like some of us.  üòÇ
---
I think the limit should be 320, it seems like a number that takes a few hours to fill up and allows you to get enough loot without breaking anything.
---
But where would they go? We don't have the highest build limits unfortunately
---
I have one if anyone is looking to trade for a gauss shotty plan üòÇ
---
That actually makes more sense now üòÇ
---
Fake news, magic effects aren't fixed on pts and bethesda didn't say anything about it.
---
If you want to dement show us proof.
---
If you have any decent shotguns im in
---
I got a quad crit boosted one and thought it could be decent. I‚Äôm a vats build so I figured why not try it. Almost got killed by a lvl 22 ghoul. I‚Äôm level 83.  Very quickly scrapped it
---
Nope
---
Because we haven't seen any debunking? Just experienced some servers that give the consistently same legendary effects?
---
Karma was pretty shite though if I can recall.
---
Alr I just leveled up saved the perk point so I went from 2 endurance to 4 endurance
---
What armor is good with explosive weapons?
---
Ignorance
---
The place looks ready to host rituals.
---
Dense torso mod ..
---
Totally agree. Whole system is out of whack. Launching Daily Ops with one Game Mode, specifically the one that disables stealth, is a terrible idea. But this what it is, that's all I'm saying.
---
Do hope they add a few more track. They didn‚Äôt add many with Wastelanders, and after two years, I‚Äôd like to hear more.
---
Mainly the combat music, it sounds all the same to me.
---
I have an inst limb minigun and the damage gains after you hit the same limb till you hit something else. With the barbwire barrels its even worse in melee, when the queen spawns and is landing on me she dies within 2seconds when I shredder her belly with the minigun.
---
Hey mate, I‚Äôm on XB1 and will lend a hand where I can, if you want to have a jam, Add me. Gamertag is Burnzze üëç
---
Well you are a step ahead of me.  I havent  even finished the colossal problem.  I started the game at the beginning of the season, buying it during the steam summer sale.  I too held off buying after the bad press, and I too am pleasantly surprised how polished and fun the game is.  That being said, the end game offers no interest.  I just dont want to participate in the 'big dick' contest.   I still have fun, but to be honest - there is no reason for me to log in.  When season 2 starts, I'll be on daily.
---
It isn‚Äôt about the value of any lost junk - one 15 minute West Tek run and I‚Äôll have it all back.  It‚Äôs more of the ‚Äúreally?  REALLY?‚Äù factor.
---
This. 
---
But don‚Äôt do the Vanguard nonsense. Not as good as people think it is.
---
Bruh I‚Äôve been doing this since the purve moved there. I literally just found about the benches in the basement yesterday afternoon.
---
I think it's to do with lag, when the scorch east queen event comes around, if all 50 players go to the event then the server will lag a ton
---
Lol, it's your plan. Name a price.
---
Yep, I'm that prick.
---
That FE is great, glad you kept it!
---
This is what I‚Äôve heard from dataminers/PTS people for the Bombs Drop stuff.
---
No point in Enforcer right now. It's not working. ü§¶
---
Wait so you can just grind junk for a month, then cancel the subscription and have loads of junk for years?
---
The whole thing is gunked up. It ultimately comes down to true weapon base damage, which no one bothered to care about because it was multiplicative buffs. If you look at the base, no perks, not mods, no mutations damage of any non-melee weapon, the math all adds up. It SHOULD take weapon mods into account, but it doesn't.
---
As for melee, basically, it's assuming you have 1 strength when it does this math. Sometimes. Because that's the true, unmodded base damage. Accounting for Strength and Weapon Mods would fix that pretty effectively...
---
I actually tried to do something with it https://twitter.com/SorehPL/status/1304743152323096578?s=19
---
I promise you, youll play entirely different when you have FO1st. Not only are you more likely to do certain actions when the risk of losing it to another player is gone (private world). And with scrapbox/survival tent youll be picking up a lot more items and exploring more off the beaten path.  
---
I highly suggest getting it. I treat FO76 as a single player game now (havent been in adventure mode in months) and enjoy it significantly.
---
In other words, they had exactly no idea of what FO fans actually wanted in the game, and wasted precious development time on stupid mechanics instead of fixing bugs.   Got it.
---
Qi understand they want to prevent server lag but things are getting real slow after level 100 and I find myself having shorter gaming sessions for each time now due to this, out of a slight  boredom.
---
My rule: If it's weightless, keep it since you'll eventually run across ammo to burn.
---
EVERYTHING IS GETTING NERFED.
---
... probably not, no. Bows don't get a huge damage boost from the Plasma mod, iirc. Pretty sure you're better off than Rifleman are at the moment. Totally forgot about bows.
---
The skin looks cool mind you but the silencer has ABSOLUTELY NO TEXTURE and none of the mechanical parts actually move as they should
---
I do t believe they can; there is no game mechanic for clearing a jam. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Lol you where talking about fairness, I just want this game to be better. A stupid limit on how much you can scripe I just game breaking because they are making big fuss about legendary for half the price and when you're done spending your scrip and gotten 20+ heavy weapon and don't have bear arm you can't move or play with your character the next week or so, but they very much like you to be a paying subscriber. If you can't play they don't give a shit it seems like after no changes for so long time.
---
It was in the OG Fallout right? Why did they stop putting it in future games to begin with?
---
I didn't have any legendary perks active that could do that. Just looked at the weapon card.
---
Depends on the cryolator but generally speaking I have a hard time selling them. Some players still use it for SBQ and other events where the enemy is ya lore and tries getting away from you. I would suggest looking it up on fed76 or nukacrypt‚Äôs companion app to know for certain, as some weapons also just work extremely well with a specific perk.
---
This post is so wholesome.  I also suck and play by myself by I heckin love it and I just run around trying to find gnomes to take pictures with.  I love all the little treat spots the devs put in that are set up for pix.  I should make an only fans for my toon.  She's a Grandma named Babayaga and I mostly wear the clown outfit.  I get so many laughs from this game.  PC.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I would die. As a handgunner main, thats my dream weapon.  Have even done the leg work for bethesda

If people want PvP why is ‚Äúhunter/hunted‚Äù never used?  Why does it take 15 minutes to fill a Nuclear Winter lobby?  My game experience doesn‚Äôt support your assertion
---
Beta player here as well and you are completely right. I was never interested in the PvP for this game and worried it would be like Ark, just brutal. But the original game had plenty of safe guards and warnings to easily avoid PvP. And even when someone did kill you you didn't loose hardly anything.
---
 Now the wasteland just feels way to safe. Restricting PvP to just workshops has really messed with the atmosphere of the game. The level of threat in this game world is almost non existent.
---
But that's what happens when you make a multiplayer game out of a franchise known for its single player. The single player crowd simply will not allow it even though this instalment was meant to be different and geez they really take it personally if they get killed in a game, I just don't get it.
---
And no distinct reload sound
---
Bethesda originally wanted to expand that number of players per a session, but I have a feeling we won‚Äôt see that happen. Their servers are pretty overloaded to the point they are rarely even adding new game content unless it‚Äôs in an instanced location. Plus, I think your feeling that the wasteland is too empty is the opposite for other people. A lot of players also like not bumping into others if they aren‚Äôt trying to.
---
This is still in the game?
---
The one where you can skip the mainframe cores door?
---
Because it's fun, plain and simple. I could go the whole "game as an escape from the mundane realities of day to day existence" but many of us already know that.
---
The game is straight up fun. Whether I'm trying a new build, wrecking shit as one of my stronger characters or exploring with friends, there's always something to do.
---
The genourosity low levels have shown me and my friend giving us all their scrap after we take some bullets for the enemies they were trying to destroy
---
The bow is totally a gimmick weapon. My friend started a new toon and made it a full on bow build. Once he hit level 50 he promptly changed it over to a commando. We started new characters at the same time. I went with a shotgun build. It took him 3 weeks longer than me to hit level 50 because he couldn‚Äôt kill things quick enough.
---
Do you still have that issue? I used to have that problem but haven‚Äôt noticed it recently. 
---
Could be it‚Äôs connected to the double walls glitch in some way.
---
Its not THEIR servers though. Every Fallout 76 game session, private or public, goes through Amazon's AWS system. Beth only needs to ask for more performance out of each public server they commission and they suddenly get more players without lag. Problem is, that costs a few extra pennies and Beth isnt about that.
---
I think it was only included in tactics. But still, the pistol is very lore-friendly.
---
Bloodied build has the best damage (may above 10X damage, conbined with perks such as  [Nerd Rage!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nerd_Rage!) , mutation of  [Adrenal Reaction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Adrenal_Reaction) ) output at the cost of low HP level, higher equipmennt demand, and more optimazation of perk cards.
---
Junkies build has the second best damage output (much lower since some perks and mutation not work at high HP) at the cost of some s.p.e.c.i.a.l. penalty, but player can maintain a high percentage of HP.
---
After how many times I‚Äôve repaired my fixer it‚Äôs more duct tape than gun now so why not use a 12 gauge suppressor
---
I would go for 6-7k if I was you. He‚Äôs listing a quick turn around value, but anything worth more than 10k you‚Äôre better off giving it some time to find the right buyer
---
Also more German weapons, we already have the MG42 (LMG) and the Volkssturmgewehr (Radium Rifle).
---
A Radium Pistol in form of an Luger would be nice. Also a real Panzerfaust (German rpg) and a KAR98K would be cool too.
---
No picture
---
Tip - go all the way to the back, and look for a holotape. Give it a listen, and I‚Äôd recommend heading to Welch via fast travel and turning right.
---
The reward shall spawn evermore.
---
If we speak of said glitch, mother ‚Äòthesda will patch it.
---
It wasn‚Äôt there at the beginning, though. She‚Äôd been there for several months before they finally added it.
---
Yet she prioritized a brewing station over it...
---
The PA plans aren't really something to resell, they're only available at the BOS robot vendors for thousands of caps so nobody's gonna sell them for anything less than their full value there. The vendors are in Watoga or Whitespring. The mods can be found in any robot vendors, but mostly Watoga. These mods are typically one-use items - you aren't gonna be substituting your Calibrated Shocks for anything in the future. 
---
As such I don't have any of the plans, only the ability to craft the stuff, all if it, for only the flux cost
---
From what I understand, there is technique/. Familiarity which will you through quicker. 
---
I believe that there is a photo mode glitch (don‚Äôt know the details) and there WAS (patched according to Angry turtle) a celling ‚Äúglitch‚Äù
---
That's a shame.
---
So... what, just a quest to introduce us to the ops and that‚Äôs all, then? Along with other minor changes to locations?
---
I just started playing about 2 weeks ago and  got it for a month just to stuff it with as much mats as I can. I figure if I can finish up some quest on a private server and get tons of resources saved up?, I;ll be ggod for a few months and won't have to resubscribe for a while.  The scrap box is the only reason I got it for a month.
---
Im changing my 10mm skin every week, from halloween to hot rod and back, pretending that its a new weapon. But this is not helping anymore.
---
They seem to be incredibly short sighted. I‚Äôm not sure they think long term, because better performance on the servers that they rent and fixing major bugs will net them more player retention and the people that refuse to buy more stuff for a game in its current state may well change their tune if Bethesda can prove they‚Äôre turning this game around.
---
I find this kinda hilarious.
---
I don't really have any sympathy for people chasing whatever cheese meta is currently popular, and the fact your support build basically undoes their whole bloody build is just delicious icing on the irony cake.
---
Could be another community event, where launching nukes and hitting certain locations adds to the score.
---
You went the long way. They went the short way. Yes you can do silo runs for basically the time it takes to protect the boys at the end.
---
Well, it's supposed to be a spin-off, not fallout 5. Testing out new ideas dont have to be a bad thing, but the whole development and management was awfully wrong and missed their fanbase entirely without any doubt for sure.
---
Get this man some more 10mm Pistol skins stat!
---
And a good automatic pistol that can‚Äôt be a single shot. Poor auto pistols need some love as the only class without a dedicated weapon (and no, the anti-scorched training pistol does not count).
---
You are part of said party. You give yourself the -25%.
---
Lol thats funny..
---
I don‚Äôt even have a problem with the basic idea of having to defend something you‚Äôve claimed.  It‚Äôs the surprise/ambush factor exacerbated by wildly overpowered magic weapons and level differences.  if contesting a workshop was more like the defend events (a one minute warning to prep) and damage was somehow made equitable (unarmed fisticuffs?  only ‚Äúdueling pistols‚Äù?  or no legendary effects?)
---
We‚Äôre you diseased at the time?
---
I know I‚Äôm sorry, whenever I try and link it to the imgur post it keeps breaking some how
---
I'd love a kar98k!
---
I got a: AA. 25 fire rate. Vats fill 15.
---
AA. Vats 50 dam. 15 relode 
---
Bloody 1 star.
---
Two shot. Vats 50 dam. 15 relode
---
A great idea that they should implement.
---
And the Mauser pistol, as featured in F1!
---
If there is a damage cap, it is broken.  The other day I was in X01 armor, full health, and got one shot melted by a magic Tesla rifle.
---
Oh yes, that's a good point. I feel better. I don't really care about the scrip, it is only about the chance for decent loot. I am constantly capping out on the 150 scrip daily scrip limit already.
---
Yes it's 58, but for some reason (bug?), mods (like prime receiver, I didnt test all of them) are added to base damage for the gatling plasma. Maybe for some other weapons too.
---
I was crippling wendigo with gauss shotgun this afternoon
---
Yea there‚Äôs a glitch to get faster you can PA glitch threw the lasers and then just photo mode for two doors and run up to the room and start initiation
---
I stole so much shit for scrap nothing I ever did would earn me positive karma so it‚Äôs probably for the best lmao
---
But how could Bethesda decide wether you would get positive or negative karma for siding with/against synths? Many would argue you should lose karma for that as it‚Äôs causing unnecessary harm to friendlies. But one could also argue you should gain karma because you‚Äôre destroying dangerous technology that shouldn‚Äôt even exist. Synths are a grey area, because while they‚Äôre technically not people, they believe they are and they look real. They even function the same way.
---
Not the same spot but nuke the fissure next to the pumpkin house.  Good spot for farming with the same trick, and other people won't think you were too dumb to hit the mine.  Coincidentally I watched someone do just that last night, completely missed and then they had to go run another silo lol.
---
Only problem with a panzerfaust is would it be crafted like a weapon or ammo since they were disposable
---
Hmmm, I seem to only stagger them. Some bullshit. Lol
---
It was also in Fallout New Vegas Honest Hearts DLC
---
Looks good!
---
Really? I was going off the description one website. "Teammates take 25% less damage" &amp;	"Player takes 33% more damage". It made it sound like it only affected your teammates? So you would need them to have Empath for you to get the benefit of -25% damage taken as their teammate?
---
The gauss shotgun plan is bound to character.
---
You‚Äôre right, forgot about that. And the base game as well, no?
---
Go to garrahan mining headquarters. You get it from doing a side quest there. Totally unrelated to raiders and settlers.
---
Yeah the 9mm Pistol looked like a 1911
---
I don't need much as far as weapons or armor goes, however I could use a good outfit to wear if you have one.  
---
BTW...what game are you moving on to?
---
Ok, semantics. Their server means the one they‚Äôre using.
---
Isn‚Äôt really that simple. The lag is from a lot of things that stress the server and it comes down to connection to the player as much as connection to the main server. We don‚Äôt know what kind of service agreement Beth has between them and Amazon as far as I know, but it‚Äôs not just ‚Äú$5 more a month and your servers will run well.‚Äù Not how it works.
---
There are different optimized plans based for different activities, such as gaming. Amazon isn‚Äôt creating a list of different pricing plans for maintaining their gaming servers. They‚Äôre just selling their services for the AWS system because different items don‚Äôt need the range of services it can offer. Even if that was true, you‚Äôre looking at much more than a few extra pennies. You‚Äôre looking at renegotiating contracts and what would most likely be an increase of infrastructure on Amazon‚Äôs part. Meaning more assets directed towards a single company‚Äôs services.
---
Hey I‚Äôm from the future and patch 22 just dropped how do I get to the BoS??
---
Maybe crafted and used like a grenade.
---
I have a demilitarized one from ww2 even with Bajonett.
---
Most legendary weapons and armour are only useful for scrip anyway, I do have fallout first now yes. However before I invested in the subscription I had 2 alt characters, one was crippled with legendary gear and junk/aid items with all the relevant weight reduction perks and armour the other full of spare ammo from trading.  I only got fallout 1st because I wanted the tent. 
---
Put the crap legendaries in you vendors for 100 caps a star and people will snap them up. If you truly have no space then just dump them. You dont need them so there is no point in hording junk. Weapons then complaining about having no space.
---
Watoga.
---
I agree
---
The Survival tents are more likely placed near Charleston Fire Station for the lead farming &amp; telephone farming, not the Rusty Pick IMO. You‚Äôve picked a popular spot for farming &amp; Camps, you‚Äôre going to have issues.
---
I really hope it's not a community event (Treasure Hunter) and that it's a normal event (Radiation Rumble). The game still needs more events even with Colossal Problem
---
Damn, aren't those kind of rare?
---
Your teammates take 25% less damage. You take 8% more damage but this can be reduced by class freak.
---
Okay I was aware that it's not related to raiders and settlers but I heard it's gonna be in a main quest
---
But I'm still not too sure with the first question should I just go do all the side quests for the chinese steal armor?
---
Only reason i have it is the Scrapbox. I collect everything i see nowadays. Even when i dont use it anymore the scrapbox is still there and holds all junk. I have around 15k steel, and thousands of lead. Im waiting for legendary perks and Ammo Factory right now.
---
Having no junk in my stash means i can store much more ammo before i have to deal with the horrendous Ammo converter, applying mods and scriping legendaries.
---
He don'twant do store them, he wanted to scripe them. Rolling my eyes.
---
It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs stopped them anyways and it just penalizes the rest of us
---
I personally recommand to side with settlers after completing all possible quests before siding. I think Gauss shortgun is much practical for current version and PTS, not to mention there are other metheds and even tricks to get extra raider reputation.
---
You can add me if you want to play my gt is Lightning080456
---
I couldn't watch the whole video due to the constant fade to blacks.
---
You could make something off the AA2515. If you just plan on selling in your vending machine, I wouldn‚Äôt ask for anymore than 5k though. 2k if you just want to sell it fast. The others aren‚Äôt really worth enough to warrant finding a buyer sadly :/
---
Oh yeah. Sorry, completely missed that part... only on my first cup of coffee. The stealth suit quest is like the third quest you get from the settlers.
---
It's actually only 24.
---
Get stealth suit it's very good.
---
Try Grahm. I‚Äôm pretty sure he has a chance for guitar sword plans. He can also spawn meat hook plans.
---
Also the Chinese Pistol!
---
I love the look and the sound of that!
---
My father paid 150‚Ç¨ and brought it to the Kripo (kriminal Polizei, basically police detectives I guess) to have it officially demilitarized. 
---
I don't know how rare those are but I'm happy to have one. 
---
Also have a Japanese shin gunto from the 1930s, 
---
a British Cavalry Saber mad in India from the 1890s, and an old  dagger, don't know its age nor its origin. It's made of bronze, and the blade is almost non existing. I think it's at least 500+ years old. It's probably african or middle eastern. My father told me it had a strong smell when he bought it on some convention.
---
nope.
---
That doesn‚Äôt look like Strangler Heart power armor to me.
---
:)
---
It's probably lore friendly.
---
The Combat rifle and Combat shotgun share a *lot* of parts. This makes perfect sense if you know anything about winning a war.
---
We could get the Chinese pistol aka the Mauser C96!
---
I'm still upset they nerfed the .50 BMG
---
The thing is I do pretty well in nuke zones etc. I don‚Äôt think I have to change my pa. But I also don‚Äôt wanna be missing out if there‚Äôs something way better.
---
Isn't that the Chinese Pistol?
---
The Chinese pistol is the Mauser C96 pistol.
---
You describe yourself in the same manner MOST players are in the game. Sure there are people with awesome weapons etc but they worked to get there and EVERYONE has to learn about the million or so little nuances that improve your play. You are not alone friend. When the day comes that you want to try another game I strongly recommend the previous 2 Fallout games. They are huge, immersive and have wonderful decision based stories.
---
I think the BoS vender (easiest at Whitespring resort) has them, otherwise I‚Äôve found the mod boxes at camp venture where you turn in technical data.
---
I had this happen to me too, I was pretty high on rads considering but it's still so sweet, those kinds of players are always crouching around and so cute. ‚ô•
---
There‚Äôs a faster way that is a bit of an issue exploit. I use it often. Once you‚Äôve done it a few times all that mainframe nonsense is very tedious, so some choose to skip it.
---
just turn the daily limit into a weekly limit like so many have suggested, more weekly limits less/no daily limits....
---
What are you missing?
---
New workbench this month.. there has been something every month
---
I messaged him and he said he would hold it and he was max caps. My 5th character has max caps.
---
So, It's working fine now? Cool!
---
Typically brand new graphics cards will have issues, especially if using the outdated drivers that are auto-installed with Windows10.
---
The manufacturer's drivers will always be up to date, oftentimes with specific fixes in them for many of today's AAA game titles. If you read the release notes for each update, you would be surprised how often your favorite games are mentioned in them as having specific fixes for.
---
I think it's the camps more than the actual player amount.
---
They could probably have way more people if they created a special server that didn't allow you to place your camp. But much of the fun comes from player vendors and building......
---
I just don't see them doing it any time soon.
---
All she did for me with 2000 scrip is break my back :(
---
Just let us scrip for the left amount...  
---
If I have 20 scrips left, i should be able to sell my 3\* armor for 24 and loose 4 if I want to.
---
If you are on PC this mod will replace the classical radio station with a ton of great fallout themed songs.

---
Unpopular opinion: I don't mind the scrip limits because it only ever gives me garbage to go back in the scrip machine anyway.  Once I've done the bullion grind there will be nothing of any value at all left in this game.
---
Take my bottle caps and give it to me!
---
With the new nodding option introduced in Fallout 4 we could technically make it automatic and add a  stock to it and make it also a comando/riflemen weapon.
---
There's some absolutely beautiful graphics in the game, especially with a cranked up PC on ultra everything. It makes for some wonderful screenshots.
---
Check my profile, I have a gallery that has a gallery section for fo76 images. I've been taking a ton more this summer that I need to edit and get on the gallery too of various scenery.
---
So do I. If you want pictures I‚Äôll upload a screenshot to imgur. Leave troll üëé
---
There's also a Tinker's Workbench in the bathroom.
---
I can't wait for One Wasteland and the Daily Ops. Legendary perks as well since I'm over level 300, but still not sure which perks, apart from the Ammo Factory, to upgrade.
---
Yeah, I always end up overencumbered during these sales. I don‚Äôt need to be able to buy more per day, but freeing up some inventory would make my life easier.
---
That would cost them double what it does now. AWS doubles every tier up to 200 people per server. Like the difference is dollars vs hundreds of dollars.  Still think Fo76 is just Bethesda experimenting with the cloud for their next gen games, make it cheap recycle as much as possible and try to make a few bucks.    
---
hell 1st probably helps pay for the monthly rate as it is. I am guessing the 8 person limit means that is AWS lowest gamefleet shard so that is .02 an hour of use or like $9 a month max. Honestly AWS has some wonky pricing and back rooms deals over what smaller firms see.   
---
Overall if bethesda could afford to go up a tier the but keep the 25 the servers would be more stable as you get more memory bandwidth each tier, kind think they did that already once. We know they take advantage of AWS's feature where if it goes below X player amount the server shutdowns to save money and condense them.   
---
Overall it is about them trying to save as much cash as possible for a game that is nothing but a experiment and not a well thought out game, that was early on but then they had the 1st idea and noticed FOMO and whales exist so they are funneling some cash in.
---
As great as that would be it is entirely unrealistic.  There's still fucking CAP limits in the game and caps are wholly worthless once you reach a certain point.
---
Amazon hates you?
---
5G gets load balanced quite a lot upstream and takes diverse routing etc. So any prolonged connections that are disconnect sensitive suffer, same happens with VoIP calls over SIP trunks, they will drop after a few mins, sometime up to 10, but they nearly always drop
---
That's pretty much whats being suggested is it not?  We currently gather notes, trade notes for bullion, and then trade bullion for plans.  The suggestion is we could gather scrip, trade scrip for some new currency, and the trade the new currency for legendary stuffs.
---
Exact wording: "Other players may initiate PvP with you by attempting to claim it from you!"
---
In fact, this is not the order in which events occur, is it? No, the PvP is initiated first, without an ounce of warning. Then while you're respawning, they claim the workshop out from under you.

---
Same glitch exploit, still in the game...
---
IGN teos102 . Im not from UK, but still same timezone. I would be happy to help
---
Bethesda has done a poor job with end game.
---
Shitty daily gating mechanics are the number 1 offenders in my opinion.
---
The really need to adjust daily scrip amounts.  Legendary hunting is a nice game play loop but you can't even get started before you are stopped by the ol' 150 per day.
---
Just upping it to 500 would be a huge game changer.
---
I have a pretty good non pa build, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt depend on a strong power armor. But seeing all these numbers, it looks like excavator is still the best to go! Maybe I should sell or scrap my other sets to make space in my stash.
---
S with strange in numbers it's 8% more. Without it it's 33% more
---
I am no vamp but I do pretty good with Earl without dying in my excavator. I only use my pa to save my stims actually.
---
Pardon. What?
---
There have been several ways of fixing it posted, I‚Äôve progressed 2 characters since the issues started,  server hopping worked for me .
---
What are you on? I‚Äôm sure someone can invite you to their private server.. that‚Äôs the easiest
---
cones witht he territory
---
Pretty sure the numbers changed since angryturtle‚Äôs video. The enemy dmg increase % of empath looks like it was less for him.
---
Bloodied and Uny will still be king.
---
It's so adorable haha ü•∞ . I had a lvl.38 join our public team and follow us to the ACP event. At the end he dropped two radaways for me and my friend thinking we were high on rads due to the event x) .
---
THIS!
---
While I'm not a single father, I do also have 2 young ones at home and only play with headphones on. The sounds within the game freak me out also. Going through Fort defiance and hearing the ghouls scury around especially while not in view, has made me jump more and I care to mentioned.
---
If you need help with ammo or supplies let me know.
---
&gt;What am I missing by not being able to progress the main story?
---
Almost everything that fills in between the grind, including the expansion which needs you to complete the Rose section of the main story to play further.
---
The game was designed to be a lawless wasteland but it's "held back" from that because it's a video game whose player base largely doesn't enjoy toxic behaviour that can sometimes come with unfettered pvp.  That kind of thing went down ok in games like Rust because it was a different player base.
---
Thank you! Yes, skins look like the only desirable details about other sets. Thank God I‚Äôm not obsessed with cosmetics.
---
yeah you are right because we paid money they should just give us max lvl character that already finish missions with god tier weapons and let us wander around I paid for this what you mean I need to play the game hell yeah lets go
---
I also have suffered from disppeared looting corpse many times.
---
Confirmation bias. And you see servers that give different legendary effects and ignore those.
---
Uh, literally says other players can initiate pvp. Pretty clear 
---
And no, op wants a second option to avoid pvp and give up when the workshop is claimed, if you read his post.
---
I think the Panzerfaust is a bit of a stretch, but I'd love to have a KAR98K and a Luger in the game.
---
I can get behind that
---
That‚Äôs unstable isotope, for sure. Those are low level Ghouls.
---
wow, how can you be so condescendant seriously... Explosives by themselves arent the problem.
---
What I said is that when tou have several players, firing several high firerate explosives weapons against the SBQ for example some players can drop below 30 fps and have high ping. So when you shoot at the SBQ she is sometimes not even where you see her anymore. Its not sucking at aiming, its just lagging.
---
And the fact that you perhaps dont experiment any lag in the game doesnt mean no one does. And what I described has been reported by many players. 
---
And thanks for your kindness, but I know what triggers magic or not.
---
Easily 95% of the map is a non pvp environment. The same way you probably wouldn't dive into the ocean around Australia because there are animals that will kill you - workshops are small oceans and occasionaly you get eaten by a shark. The same way you might enjoy killing the queen or base building - people like myself enjoy hunting down and killing players. Nothing is more enjoyable to me then hunting down someone who has a hot mic. If you dont like being gunned down, build your character in a way that you can defend yourself.
---
I got 5k out of it, could've done more but I'm satisfied since it was honestly pretty fast. Thanks for the input guys :)
---
too cute
---
Basically cell/mobile data connections aren't the best for real-time data streams.
---
It's why YT/video players/streaming movies etc use buffers :-)
---
Either that or put the Makarov (deliverer from fo4) in the game.
---
I had it for 4 or 5 months.
---
I love the junk storage but 12.99 a month for that is pretty spendy so I canceled last month.
---
If it offered double camp budget I'd re-subscribe!
---
It'll be a variant skin for the 10mm
---
I have to admit, with all the smoke and general orangeness outside, I get a bit tense just being in a Nuke Zone now.  I'm definitely never going to see those the same way again.
---
Hey bloodied guys. Just a question for ya. 
---
I joined a public building team yesterday. And this level 180-something was sharing sunkissed. Doesn't that screw over your bloodied set up assuming its day time? I don't play bloodied so it didn't affect me, but it just seems that sharing that perk is only done to mess with bloodied builds.
---
Or am I overthinking this?
---
The cap limit prevents massive price inflation in player to player trading. The other limits are just to slow players down.
---
That's not really debunking, that's just a possible explanation.
---
The message literally says that PvP is initiated by other players claiming the workshop, but that's not true. They don't have to attempt a claim before cheap shotting your ass. If they did, that would be exactly what the creator of this thread wants. Prior warning that someone wants the workshop, thus giving you a chance to leave.
---
You just going to let another man come and take what's yours? I bet you are super excited for all the communist armor skins this upcoming season.
---
I'm on PC, Xbox Game Pass.  I would love to try a private server, but server hopping hasn't done the trick for me yet.
---
I mean, I've been playing for a couple months, and every new day I log in, I fast travel to the lab and try to "install the T-Fuse" and use the terminal to scan the blood.  The terminal always tells me that it doesn't see any blood. 
---
From there, I just go out and explore, grind for xp and compete daily stuff and side quests.   Every new play session, I go back to see if that day is my lucky day.
---
Oh believe me, I've been looking everywhere for him for the last few days and had 0 luck.
---
I've found the mod boxes lying around in Watoga.
---
Inside the lvl3 locked door at the transportation center where there is a PA frame, and near the voting printers between the transportation center and the train station. Across from emergency services.
---
I've picked up Headlamps for red, blue, purple, vaultboy there (across from emergency services)
---
Well, at least us heavy gunners will be fine.
---
Well, that's depressing.  It's been nearly 8 weeks of side quests, exploring and daily quests for me.
---
I was on last night but none of my friends were online. I'm still to low lvled to do a lot of areas alone. Noticed a good bit of lvl 1 players about to leave the vault so I ended up roaming the vault area for a few hours handing out water and food to new players. 
---
 Where can I find decent armor for mid lvl 20? ALL I find is normal clothes. I have some power armor "almost a full set" but not enough core's to use it on a regular basis. Plus I don't have a stand so I can't work on it lol I'm by no means asking for a handout! Just directed maybe.
---
Lol, it's clear.
---
If op is asking for the pop-up to be reworded, I could probably agree with that to clarify for those that don't understand...
---
But a second, give up option, after pvp is initiated, is pointless. It's already agreed to.
---
But it‚Äôs 5g internet, not 5g data, I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm being complicated I‚Äôm just confused
---
I‚Äôve had it for a year now and it might not be a lot but we have gotten rewards and discounts more lately. So I can‚Äôt complain, plus the atoms we get is enough for me as the scrap box and tent are a must anymore. So I have no problem spending 12 dollars a month even if they didn‚Äôt give out rewards for free
---
I have that blue and purple are you on Xbox
---
from my experience, if that player had a magic weapon lvl 30 and had all the correct build, he can do more damage than a lvl 160 that goes there with the intention of leeching to get 2x 3\* weapons
---
I find them all the time in one spot plus I have the vats one also
---
PC, sorry. And I want Red.
---
Or just let us scrap lengedary items for modules when we run out of scrip. Odds of gaining a module should increase with # stars an item has.
---
What‚Äôs the spot?
---
This.
---
Yeah but I also have red. I have found it right near the bunker near fissure prime. If you goto the crashes verta bird near there it will be a mod sitting there and most of the lights I‚Äôve gotten are from that spot.
---
Internet is served to you over a data connection.
---
Do you mean it's a wired service, connected via fibre/copper, or is it via a wireless/cellular connection?
---
What level are you now and what sort of ammo /guns do you need? I'll be on at some point today what times do you normally get a chance to play?
---
Damn, thanks for the heads up
---
All the mutations were allright, then "resilient"
---
I'm fucked
---
Are these builds hated? I'm more of the follower teammate vrs wanting to lead. Most games if available I'll go for a medic build, to be more helpful to the group.
---
Next time I catch him I‚Äôll shoot you a message. If I don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll find him next Meat Six Days.
---
I had my bloody ones for sale for 1000 caps and no one bought it in 2 months, scrip em
---
Wish i could store caps in my stash or expand my deposit box storage. If server load is that bad, go with offline storage.
---
I call this one the tinkle workbench.
---
lol, the pop-up lies.
---
That is not how you negotiate. Demand higher than you want so the compromise comes out in your favor.
---
Scrap and Store. trust no one. not even the Overseer's house
---
Wish someone would have waited for me when I died...
---
How does game lore explain the various cosmetics in the atom shop, by this I mean stuff like the vault boy/girl heads for PA and other things.
---
It doesn't.
---
I would say if they introduced the weapons themselves, yeah, that breaks lore. But skins, I'm OK with that.
---
Would love to have a BFG2000 skin for something like the plasma caster or another heavy weapon.
---
Back in my day we didn't slap guns together willy nilly
---
Thank you for clarifying. I appreciate it. I'm struggling with pricing items. Is there a guide somewhere that I can use? And after patch 22. Weapon will change.
---
It probably does, although as with every single other aspect of the game they messed that up too.  Inflated prices would only really affect lower players (probably not even those if the vendor cap limit wasn't there either), but it also means things that are *actually* valuable cannot actually be bought with any type of currency.
---
I kept one of them, and script the rest. Thank you:)
---
With love, this is an echo chamber of "Game bad" yet everyone keeps playing it complaining. Putting up a post and everyone upvoting and agreeing shows a) we are not being heard or b) we're being heard and ignored. This same post worded slightly different by another Fo76 player will be up in the next few days and that will be upvoted to oblivion aswell.
---
Cancel your Fallout 1st, uninstall the game until there are significant changes.
---
I can explain it, but not in English, give me a few minutes.
---
I absolutely agree, I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. It‚Äôs amazing how much scrap I have just from running around
---
That's fucked that we have to pay to make a fallout game feel like a fallout game.
---
I was in X-01
---
I usually only get this the first time I use the wheel and then it works well later. So "break it in" at the beginning of your session so that when you need it you'll be okay
---
You can just stay in the mine until the end, you will get teleported out when its over. Just be sure to put on power armor or a hazmat/stealth suit because you will exit into a nuke zone
---
Lol aint that the truth.
---
I just stay and loot the wendigos til the timer runs out. You won't lose your junk when the mine collapses on you, and you'll still receive rewards for completing the event.
---
Juts stay there until, it collapses, you get spawned outside automatically with no consequences, that way you keep loot and still get rewarded, if you fast travel out you don't get the event rewards as you are removed from the instance.
---
I‚Äôm guessing T-45 is more common? I mean I‚Äôve read about it more than any of the others. I‚Äôve had a look online where abouts I need to be looking, but as I‚Äôm not planning on finding it via a quest, I was a little unsure once I get it, how I was going to use it. Fallout 76 is the first fallout game I‚Äôm playing to introduce me to game series, but story wise I‚Äôm already hooked, I have seen the intro to fallout 4 and it nearly had me in tears üòÇ definitely will be playing that one after this üòä
---
Aww that‚Äôs so nice of you! I appreciate the offer, although I‚Äôm not sure where to even find black ore just yet, I‚Äôll look it up and be back in touchüòÜ if you wanna add me in the meantime I‚Äôm on Xbox too, my GT is chloelouise3003
---
Framerate is absolutely independent to the ping. Frames are generated from the gpu feeded with calculations the cpu did provided by the ram which got his data from the hard drive. Network is mostly positioning of different id's and entitys aswell as player/npc/environment interaction.
---
What are legacys? Explsovie energy weapons mostly. Thats the only thing I mentioned as explosive.
---
If the position marker of an enemy isn't align with other clients doesnt matter in this case, since it doesnt matter for you. The game sends data to the server including your position, where you shooting at with which weapon, fire rate and other modifiers like perks etc. And which entity id you are hitting. Even IF you are shooting past the enemy on other clients, only your data counts for your damage calculation.
---
Only certain types actually reduce the weight when bulked to help with storage space so don‚Äôt bulk everything. You should be able to look up which ones reduce weight.
---
for most bulks, only storage space you save is from spending 2 plastic per bulk. bulks can be sold to robot vendors for some easy caps.. but are dropped when you die
---
That sucks buddy, I'd suggest jumping on the market sub, either look for a bloodied heavy weapon or put a post up after one
---
Lul. Then are there other types that can't be sold? Or are we just basically looking at floaters
---
These are basically ideas the Vault 76 dwellers have or things they somewhere saw and rebuild. Their is nothing out of the ordinary there that comes to my mind.
---
Open a support ticket is the only way to get it pack
---
no you shouldnt
---
unless they changed something there are only two or three ressources that actually get lighter by bulking them
---
if you mass bulk items you may get the feeling that it helps you in terms of weight but thats only because you burn plastic in the process
---
you should only bulk stuff if you want to sell it to robot vendors
---
(lead and aluminum should loose weight, im not sure though)
---
Meelzonwheelz1 Xbone my dude hmu anytime.!
---
Most will say only bulk when you're ready to sell your extra materials (certain mats have to be in bulk form to sell to vendors). I prefer bulking as I go. That way, once I reach storage ccapacity,I don't have to worry about traveling to a tinkerer bench before heading to a station. Plus, bulk items are near the top of your stash box list, making it a little easier to see how much needs sold. That being said, if you're struggling with plastic, only bulk what you intend to sell.
---
Have you re-logged and checked, what platform.
---
I've been looking into it, Bethesda won't return lost items regardless of the cause.
---
Bethesda actually said the atom shop isn't lore friendly, they just put whatever they want in there. So it's plausible to put those designs in there
---
lol
---
Maybe not but I did just try this (Instigating Limb Suppressed Pump Shotgun with a piece of magic armor) and while sneaking I killed a Legendary Sheepsquatch without having to reload.
---
I can craft the hat or the outfit. I don‚Äôt remember which one. But if you want either one. 
---
Killer-Soldier1
---
Ahh that‚Äôs good to hear as that is the set of quests I‚Äôm currently on so thank you! Will finish them when I log back on. I have the karma mod added to her syringer, just need to go shoot a Yao Guai with it, and I think one other thing she wants me to do lol then I‚Äôm done with that one fingers crossedü§ûüèª
---
Marketplace sounds sketchy, hearing tons about people getting sold duped items that just end up disappearing all the same. I'll check it out tho, and pray the 10k I've got saved will cover me. I was about to put a primed reciever on it, too... So sad
---
End of the day you‚Äôll have all the caps you can handle! Glad you found yourself a buyer
---
Late to the topic , but he can be gooified as well as dismembered , found that multiple times
---
Yup tried twice now, nada.
---
Lol, I get this all the time. Radaways and stimpacks are always dropped by new guys. I appreciate the gesture. So I usually make them a shielded wet suit.
---
You nailed it!
---
Bulk and sell it in your vending machines. People are more inclined to buy bulk scrap for 50+ caps than loose scrap for 2 to 7 caps a piece.
---
I'll give you 2000 for free if you're on Xbox
---
[this may be helpful](https://discord.gg/YKY26m)
---
I'm in this discord. Friendly bunch, we've got a trading area for Xbox, ps and pc players, they'll be able to sell you on probably :)
---
You can look up fed76 or nukacrypt‚Äôs companion app. They have price checkers that will tell you it‚Äôs tough value, how much you could quick trade in vendors, it‚Äôs value to most traders, and value to niche markets. It‚Äôs the closest thing you‚Äôll get to a complete weapon/armor trade list.
---
You may want to hold back awhile using it tho after the patch. Bloodieds and junkies may become worth less as fewer ppl will feel the need to commit to them to stay in the meta.
---
Some weapons have a max level of 50. While other weapons have a max level of 45. 
---
I think it might be the same for some armor pieces.
---
Yes, 100 GB per each. 3 a day.
---
I have the hat but if you have the costume I'll buy it off you!
---
Yes, they did in a hot fix before patch 21.
---
If you do choose to run out, the exit will light up with yellow spinny lights above the door...hard to see but the exit is to the RIGHT of the death drill sticking out of the wall!
---
Shut up Gramps, yes you did.
---
The vendor that sells it spawns sometimes at the Lost Home in Cranberry Bog. I caught her yesterday and she had two!
---
No charge.
---
Was thinking about this too. Have friends in Oregon who have been sharing pics out their window. 
---
Started hearing Orange Colored Sky in the back of my head.
---
This happened to me several times - can't run in power armor because exceeding weight limit so ditching PA, once getting out of the mine there is very little time to get in the PA again before getting rad roasted -  it is so annoying... Well this is one way to manage junk inventory :)
---
What do you mean scrip limit? Last time I played I had 400 scrip?
---
Yes, please.
---
Gl hugging the deathclaw ;)
---
Have you not struggled a lot?? I‚Äôm level 26 and the places my quests are sending me to, there‚Äôs a few level 60 odds wandering about.. I don‚Äôt know if this is right but it would be almost impossible for me to survive against enemies that are this high level and it‚Äôs a tad annoying having to sneak really slow so they don‚Äôt detect you. 
---
Long story short, I died an awful lot in my last session without making much process due to this problemü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Do you remember where you got the plan? It's the one plan that I've inexplicably wanted for forever.
---
Really really strange... it would be nice if you could give more example but I think at this point we just wait until it hits live server.
---
I'll check it out thanks!
---
Or let us go over the limit. I don‚Äôt care if I lose 1-10 scrip
---
Nope haven‚Äôt struggled really. But I held off on the main quests, I‚Äôve literally only just done vault raids and dropping nukes, I focussed on levelling and doing public events and just having fun that way and then the quests were super easy
---
Oh wow thank you so much! If you need anything let me know
---
This I've never understood if you launch the nuke right you can exit the the nuke zone in a few seconds
---
Purveyor*
---
And it's there to make you log in every day, so you have to look at the atom shop every day. It's not going anywhere unfortunately.
---
This was a while ago
---
What is the point of a limit?
---
There are a a few spawn locations where the dead npc might spawn with the plan. But I serve server hopped so many times that I got tired of it. I actually gave up on getting it. 
---
A few days ago I decided to go to whitepsring (under the snake picture) by that monument where the robots always spawn. And I saw the dead witch there with the plan. 
---
So it‚Äôs honestly random. I just got lucky I guess.
---
It's all about sales. Sales sales sales. Even thr scrip limt and daily caps you can earn are sales tactics.
---
Can confirm it still works on the PTS, so it will still work after the update.  Eventually it will maybe get patched and should have been the priority to get fixed instead of just nerfing damage across the board for legit weapons.
---
I have been thinking "they'll fix magic weapons in the next patch" since I first picked one up 8 months ago but they still work.
---
scum of the earth seems... a bit extreme, no?
---
Yeah, I haven't really noticed it either, and I am notorious for forgetting a wall and swearing profusely when i have to paper it with stuff on it, but this past week I rebuilt, and, true to form, forgot a wall. Applied the wallpaper after resigning myself to actually redoing it......and nothing came off? I have double walls on ALL walls and everything stayed. I hope OP is just suffering from a lag glitch but I kinda swear Bethesda addressed it?
---
Alas all that does is deincentivise me from actually spending any actual money on it.
---
Super lucky! I server hopped forever in different spots and could never find her. I'll have to try there. Thank you!
---
If you came looking for a mix of yeses and nos you came to the right place my friend!
---
I personally don't think it does
---
Ya, but they aren't worried about people like you who aren't going to spend money anyway. They want the compulsive shoppers to be exposed to the atom shop as much as possible.
---
Had someone using a tesla rifle last night for the first time against Earle and noticed no lag whatsoever. Is this just a console problem?
---
i like to jump in and out, so i let the sub lapse.  yes, its very possible to play &amp; enjoy this game w/o the sub.
---
psa tho: if you do sign up &amp; then cancel, make sure you don't get auto-subbed every month.  under services, it may not list fo1st as a re-occuring monthly charge, but it'll still charge you.  make sure to go to your settings and put "auto-fund ps4 wallet" to no.
---
&gt;as my stash was full and so was my secondary character.
---
And my third and fourth mules as well. 
---
&gt;Really rustles my jimmies.
---
Agreed. My jimmies are also quite rustled.
---
For the love of Atom, Bethesda please up or remove the damn limit already. You want me to play the game, and I want to play the game but your pointless limitations keep me from playing the damn game!
---
Balls in your court BSG.
---
We get weekly discounts on re rolled atom shop items. The trouble is that those are showed on the main atom page‚Äôs last tab and not marked at 1st discount items. And lately they have been putting the monthly 1st items on that tab as well. Leads 1st members to believe that non 1st members are also getting them. The only way we know for sure is by checking Bethesda‚Äôs website (not hard/just sayin) to know what‚Äôs new or discounted for 1st. I‚Äôm a little salty about the permanent workshops they promised for private servers but I never realistically expected them either. And I‚Äôd like to add that I don‚Äôt mean for any of that sound elitist.
---
Believe you can ask for a courier to help you out. Just comment !courier and they will assign you one. Tell them what you need and they should be able to help you out.
---
Take my upvote. I havent played since the purveyor sale started since all my characters are now over weight. Cant fast travel anywhere. This would solve that.
---
Been there. Logged on one day and my two main fixers were gone. Terrible. And I had got them from the purveyor so it‚Äôs not like they were duped.
---
Most junk when scrapped down weighs 0.1lbs. When bulked, they can weigh from 0.75 to 1.5. Most junk bulks in 10's. But some bulk in more quantities. For example, steel weighs 0.1lbs. 30 steel per bulk unit. Bulked steel weighs 1.5lbs. So you are saving 1.5lbs. 
---
I haven't tested it but I think anything that bulks with more than 10 base quantities, should save you weight.
---
You can only do 150 scrip a day, and you can only hold... i think 1500 max?
---
Tbh I did consider just doing all my side quests in order of when I was given them so hopefully they will start off easier and gradually get harder rather than just full on throwing myself in the deep end. Think that just may be where I‚Äôm going wrong, trying to do too many main missions too early on I think.
---
So, you intentionally use a glitch to punish those who may be unintentionally have those glitched machines at their camp?
---
And what makes you think you will be unpunished for using glitch yourself?
---
I meant more like Atlas, not the treasure moles (though those are vastly improved now, whenever they come back).
---
They will just abandon it. They aren't going to magically start doing everything we ask them to do because they're losing money.
---
You are right. It doesn't. I tested this a week or two ago after getting into argument about this with my friend.
---
You can join me if you‚Äôre on Xbox. I‚Äôll hook you up with some decent  armor and under armor. ‚ÄúTomiGunz‚Äù I‚Äôll be on in about a half.
---
Yep! Search up Angry Turtle on YouTube. He has a whole slew of vids on Magic Weapons, what causes it, the prefixes and or legendary effects you need AND which ARMOR makes everything magic!
---
You could move your camp closer to a random spawn event. You can find a map of where these are online. I didnt know about this then but i had my camp on one. Pretty much had to fight something everytime i fast travelled back to my camp. Funny thing is i eventually moved my camp and unwittingly placed it right next to another one before figuring out these mechanics. Youll get anything from scorchbeasts, fog crawlers, deathclaws to a squad of supermutants/ ghouls depending on where you decide to put your camp. Since youre looking for entertainment id place it next to areas that spawn groups of npcs that are supposed to fight each other on encounter, so theres more of em
---
Nope it doesn't. It's extremely easy for you to go and test.
---
The fastest way to get rad protection is to keep a hazmat or Chinese stealth suit on the favorites wheel. Well at least it would be the fastest way if the favorites wheel didn't lag out for about 1 minute the first time you attempt to use it after logging in. Made that mistake last time. Lol.
---
One does not put strain on the servers and ruin it for others, the other simply makes me turn your computer into gamma rounds. Calm down guy-who-obviously-has-ammo-factories
---
I am on Xbox. I'll add ya in a few, waiting on breakfast lol will be from w024
---
Im on console, rarely have an issue with it. Might be an overheating problem.
---
I might stop playing if its as crazy a nerf as they say, I love my Rifleman build. Fucking bullshit they've completely ruined the ability to have a build thats not a heavy gunner build. Watch everyone get really pissed off when SBQ and Earl become impossible to beat and Bethesda hopefully reverts the change until they figure out how to balance weapons without nerfing them so significantly that everything is worthless. So glad I held onto my 3* TSE Gatling Plasma tho
---
Wow that's sad and unnecessary
---
I cam help you if you want
---
Definitely not.  At the line in the sand event I was down to single digit frame rates on a PC using a 2080 graphics card.  But only when I looked at the ash piles...if I looked up, 120 frames.
---
Using my private world, I have moved excess scrip weapons, excess ammo and foods that I want to keep from spoiling to an alt by just dropping it and switching toons literally hundreds of times and not once have I ever lost anything. I always do the swapping in front of Vault 76 since, if I'm overencumbered, I can just kill myself and FT there for free.
---
If you want to do this, just let me know. I have decent karma on the trade site and dont mind helping as I do this often. Gt narmyknight
---
Yeah mine was from the purveyor, too, so I was really confused at first. Just bad luck
---
We could be able to aquire it from a museum if they added it ???
---
It's connected to another ammo factory. There is one that is the "base" and will move over to others if they are all wired together. Can find the first one if you follow the cords from the generatord to the first factory.
---
I continue to play because I can run around and 1 shot everything like a god, now I'm gonna be bored cause I can't
---
If you are on ps4 i give you the best weapons  and armor
---
yeah its been reported hundreds of times, use the search or try googling
---
I think m1 garand and m14 would be cool too. They have 1911 in some comics too, at least I‚Äôm pretty sure these is.
---
Not everyone comes to reddit to learn these things.
---
Just like strangler heart, etc.
---
There's a few of us on the internet looking for info.  I've got several friends that play and they never know any of the things i tell them. 
---
My kid plays fortnite and I've seen where they'll have a message that "grenades are taken out of the game due to a glitch".    Then when it gets fixed they enable that weapon again.
---
It would be nice if we just didn't have to deal with problems like this and non working perks for months before they get patched.
---
Same issue on Xbox üëçit was after I logged in and atom shop was inaccessible
---
Then don't lock them and hide them. This is for those that do that for massive profit. Regardless of intention, you still have an item that is straining servers.
---
I‚Äôm a dad of 6 kids I know what you mean and I also love this game. I only get to play at night right when they all have fallen asleep and right before I go to bed for work. I play on Xbox and I can help you out if you would like. I know the struggles of trying to find time to play and get the guns or armor you want. Let me know
---
If you can afford to make serums before a PvP session, you don‚Äôt even need to run class freak.
---
Don't know why low levels run from me...Is it the Chameleon armor with the Ritual Bindings and Mask? Maybe the fact I sometimes wait outside of Vault 76 and occasionally stalk players cause I have nothing better to do...Nah, that can't be it.
---
Bethesda be like, "Add another currency to the game?! Write that down, write that down!"
---
Can confirm it is exactly 5 minutes before the world resets.
---
i had the same problem.  I changed the ethernet cable and solved the problem.
---
Yep, lost my twinks scout right leg with chameleon ap refresh sentinel twice within two weeks. I was lucky I had friends with hoarding addiction, but it still sucks to loose items from your played equipment.
---
I also lost my camps several times now, they just vanished after being offline for a day without any note and replacing were free even solo on a private world.
---
I'm now used to things disappearing and have connections to replace my stuff.
---
Should be fixed in the new update
---
near the actual exit to the ouside is a chest that you can loot as well, so run out, and 10m before the mine exit is the chest on your right
---
sadly i'm on pc
---
I havent been playing long enough for 3rd/4th. Just started playing since about March. Have numerous hours played due to Covid lockdown. Doing this limit really sucks. I worked out in this sale for 1000script you get 20 weapons. Total could be 400extra pounds. You may get 2 you like and one to sell in your vendor. You are then stuck for days chomping them in a machine unable to buy anymore. Or you grind the heavy ones and sell the rest. Thus leaving you with no caps and no script and a full stash. I am super tight with inventory and had to quit early today because there just was no point in doing anything. Cant sell, cant store. Cant really make and learn weapons as you cant go on scrap hunts as you get other useless stuff you get stuck with. Rinse and repeat the circle jerk.
---
I just want no caps on all currencies, like 30k caps is too few, if I could I'd have close to a million caps rn because I barely have a use for them anymore
---
&gt;Amazon charges in tiers with performance going up in most tiers. They can choose to go up a couple tiers from wherever they are at and get significatly better performance on the account of it. Yes, it would cost a few bucks more but they have the profit margin to cover it.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Once you have better servers and can offer players better features and more storage in their camps, you have an increased player base who is willing to spend more money. So in the end, you make more by spending more. They dont care about that though, its all about that here and now.
---
Last post was removed by the automod because of the link I included to the Amazon AWS pricing page.
---
They need to also add the service rifle from new Vegas! Not as a skin but as a stand alone weapon
---
While id MUCH  prefer an actual 45 caliber pistol qith better damage.  This would be acceptable to me, the 10mm is a fallout staple,  but my god is it ugly/the size of a small car.....
---
That's good to know.  Thanks for putting this all together of course.  I have an AAE lever action and a TS handmade, but almost a full set of unyielding secret service armor that I just have in my stash for if I ever roll a bloodied rifle and want to try it out
---
Pc? Probably because you were on pts
---
We all have stories like that :D
---
One for me is not finding the workbench weapon repair option until week 2 or 3. I scrapped and rebuilt too many pipe guns! lol
---
Yes.  That was the case for me at one point.  Opened game and atom shop/lego run just spun and wouldn't load.  Closed out and tried again after a few minutes.  Wonder if that was what did it.  Sucks.  I use emoji all the time and mostly non-default ones.
---
Kinda stinks I literally just dropped over 5000 last night as I needed to make room in my stash
---
It‚Äôs not broken . They just changed it so that it doesn‚Äôt proc on the explosive effect , just the actually pellets
---
I don't pts.
---
I‚Äôm telling you if you search the sub data miners have debunked this a long time ago. Any Anecdotes to the contrary, are just that, anecdotes.
---
Sound advice. Thank you. Ive been doing it whenever it comes up now Ive finally got brave enough to try it and each time Im feeling like Im doing better or at least figuring more things out about how to do as best I can. Its fun and Im enjoying it
---
I guess there's just something to it that only effects certain people. I mean it's obviously a real issue, I was expecting to fail when I saw that guy standing around holding a tesla was but pleasantly surprised it had no effect.
---
Im playing call of duty all though its kinda boring but I like setting milestones in it and getting them and going "OHHHHH MY FUCKING GOD REEEEEEE" and doing something super cool
---
Branded as ‚Äòrecalculation‚Äô and idiots welcome it. Handmade‚Äôs drum mag holds fewer rounds than banana clip because it was a ‚Äòbug‚Äô that needed ‚Äòfix‚Äô.
---
Melee has a hard time especially if going in power armor makes them overburdened they wont get a single kill without it . Maybe turn the graphics down a little and it wont lag.
---
Oh didnt know that. Its a shame the support is not able to help you in this situation hopefullyi u find another
---
What about BIV music? Would like to have this at my camp
---
The terminal used to operate the centrafuse does not analyze the blood samples and instead outputs "Requires blood" error messege.[verification needed]
---
This bug is slated to be fixed with Patch 22.
---
They never reworked legacies or removed hacked weapons, so there's a lot of non-legit and duped magic weapons floating about. 
---
Magic weapons that drop are the only option for many people to compete in the event of a boss minute kill, in a weird way they brought their own balance.
---
still it should be a positive patch with all new content. players will adjust and hopefully some balance changes will get into queue in next patches. :)
---
Not to mention you can change group goals on the fly! I usually have a Building team for the general INT/XP boost on everything and then if an event pops and we choose to do it.....change the team goal. Takes two whole clicks and boom! Event XP! You can change it right back to Building or whatever, whenever.:)
---
Unless you sell some armor. Scrip needs to be increased to at least 500. And make all items end in 5 or 0 not this 3, 6, 9, 24 crap.
---
One of the best ideas I have herd I a long time. Stash even with F1st is crazy to manage. I was thinking add an ammo box like the scrap box but holds unlimited ammo for those who like to hold a lot of what they need. 
---
Your idea would make even more space in my stash though this would be a great add.
---
Until BSG fixes this (however unlikely) I would suggest making yourself another character/alt/mule to transfer things to. Easy to transfer if you have private server. If not you can enlist a friend to help or if you are on Xbox, I'd be happy to help you move your stuff.
---
They should really add a vendor bot so when players are overencumbered with dozens of unwanted junk and can‚Äôt scrip them, at least they can sell it for caps on the spot and move on.
---
Sales sales sales!
---
Confirmed,  it does not. Proven in several experiments where people shot at camp walls with wall signs to destroy and also confirmed by dataminers who checked if the perk is tied to ballistic non explosive guns which is not the fact.
---
I did a quick search and all i found was people agreeing with the theory a month ago. I would like to find confirmation either way though.
---
Yesn't
---
Any video proof for yes/no ?
---
Or you just mind your own business instead of being a dick for people who did nothing against you. Then you come back later to comply about explosive baits, at this point it will be just karma hitting back
---
It's also unlisted
---
I kind of gave up on the purveyor as I have never got anything from her that I‚Äôve kept and really used... am I missing something?  Everything I use seems to be from drops.
---
Thank you. I am on PC. I have a friend who plays with me as we are both in ISO (108 days offical and a lot more for us) so we both mule. I have a spare character who I am using for the next SCORE. I dont think I could track anymore than two.
---
Takes 2 minutes to test it yourself.
---
As I mentioned in one of my comments below, fallout 76 is the first fallout game I‚Äôve played.
---
I know the intro to fallout 4 and it gripped me straight away but with never playing a fallout game before, I found the controls a little overwhelming at first. Few months later I decided to try FO76 and I love it, will definitely be trying fallout 4 again in future. 
---
Thank you for being patient with me even though I know very little by the way, I have read up a lot on fallout about the nukes and where fallout 76 fits into the storyline so I know bits, the important stuff. 
---
Just needed a little advice on the power armour side of things really so I can have more of a chance at surviving if I see another random high level enemy, been happening to me a lot unexpectedly past couple of days while I‚Äôve been doing Rose‚Äôs quests.
---
Yeah I'm stuck until I find a replacement, cant really progress without it.
---
I use tesla and I have no problem, the weapon is good for dealing with large group of enemies. I'm not gonna stop using it
---
I will keep my eye out for the quest, thank you! üòä
---
Yeah but they are unremovable meaning that most people would want to hide it instead. There are a lot of people that would report someone for just having one sitting in their camp so all they can do Is hide it.
---
Omg yes
---
490 to 180. What a total fucking piss take.
---
Happened to me on PS4 too
---
I am in the same boat- got a toddler at home and only play Friday and Sat late nights after.  My highest character is 21 despite playing since release.  It‚Äôs a total struggle and I love it!
---
has it resolved?
---
Ohhh that cunt already tried giving me grief.. safe to say he won the fight. EVERY. DAMN. TIMEüôÑ
---
I also got alot of luck at this position, just teleport to the memorial and turn left to cross the street.
---
Also the location at crevasse dam in the mire is a good one, just teleport there and turn 90¬∞ right, straight on the road is the encounter.
---
Yeah preferably it gets patched but people knowingly chug the game in events and boss fights it‚Äôs super irritating. Obviously some people aren‚Äôt in the know but the majority are just trolls
---
Would help if you're on pc...
---
Ok cool. Its stupid that the limits on this game basically force us to have multiple characters. Got four now myself and already considering adding another. Ugh... Good luck out there-
---
You could could simply unpower the machine. No power = no noise = no ammo being made. Everyone that I have found has windows around it so you can obviously see it and always has it's own fusion generator next to it. Simply unpower it and then the item puts no strain on servers; pretty simple to do.
---
Thank you for the tip üòÅ
---
The qffr one in things dps
---
Not sure, I manually reset my emojis and loot bag. I have noticed with the vault look bag skin in particular that the inventory doesn‚Äôt show up unless the sights is directly on one of the corners whereas the default shows up no matter where I‚Äôm looking on the bag
---
Dude line in the sand is cancer with a bunch of people using Tesla‚Äôs. It also depends on if they spam the shit out of them
---
only bulk the stuff you plan to sell. and sell the stuff you arent actually using. nobody needs 200 peices of wood.
---
Have fun yourself. I am trying to stick with two
---
Characters one sniper and one punchy. Everything build and direction wise is on hold for the patch
---
It‚Äôs not local lag or have anything to do with your graphics card, it‚Äôs game optimization lag. Did ACP where a couple people were spamming their Tesla, frame rate went to almost nothing on Xbox1X , every other time it‚Äôs been fine until a couple people spam the Teslas. Even on a private server with 3 people doing ACP I told my buddies not to use the Tesla, then when we killed Earle and one guy pulled out his Tesla to mop up the wendigos, there was a noticeable lag and frame rate drop.
---
I made a comment on spot on the other message I wrote. I find them at that crashed verta bird every time I go there. Sometimes it will be another mod but I‚Äôve gotten every color plus vats one from that spot near fissure prime
---
Thank you for confirming I wasn‚Äôt imagining things!
---
In all fairness, she doesn‚Äôt take it from you. She lets you keep them.
---
because, according to Todd Howard, "It's the apocalypse, not an amusement park."
---
I envy you
---
Nope mine did it last week for some reason I had to select it all. It was right after all those ppl where getting free atoms
---
This is the way
---
Could someone explain to me what a bloodied build is? I keep seeing the term thrown around.
---
Yeah i just mean that I have had issues with people sending me rude messages for having one unpowered in my camp. It‚Äôs not my fault that it‚Äôs there all I can do is try to hide it
---
While you won‚Äôt be able to start wastelanders, if you head to the fire breather station, you can keep going on the main mission.
---
Not sure if you're old enough to remember Asheron's Call, but they had a dedicated PvP server that outlasted most all of the non-PvP servers by years. There's definitely a desire for PvP, and putting it on it's own server seems like a reasonable solution. And I agree, Fallout should be dangerous for PC and NPC alike. But I doubt we'll ever see such a solution regardless of how difficult it may be to implement. Plus it requires them to better balance weapons and character traits to keep it interesting. We can only hope.
---
You can't sneak at all in Daily Ops. It's a real FU to players specced into stealth.
---
Anyone know if an instigating/aim damage/faster crit pump shotgun is magic? I'm trying to avoid magic weapons tbh. I've used it a bunch and sometimes it seems to deal a lot of damage, but the spread is too tight for me to be able to make out the damage numbers. I'm not wearing 15% block armor.
---
Pvp?
---
I stopped using it when I realized I was messing with other people frame rates and game.play.  I'm not a fck nugget.
---
You don‚Äôt have any mods that could be causing this, right?
---
Nope, any
---
Pretty sure they are gonna make the paladin Roman person the east coast elder after they settle in
---
I do but it‚Äôs on Xbox. There is a spawn near top of map I can‚Äôt remember exact spot
---
I can also understand that point of view üòÅ
---
Must be nice because every time I find her she only has chems or junk. One person on Xbox had her and I joined and got clean straight jacket but that was it
---
I use a Two Shot Cryolator and it's pretty good in PvP, I only use it against bloodied builds tho.
---
Use the BOS vendor is watoga. It sells the t60 mods. The raider plans are at pleasant valley ski resort.
---
The wastelanders theme is just beautiful... There are so many layers to that composition...I especially love the faint electronic beat that softly runs throughout the entire piece.
---
The radio tunes I think are fair. They pulled some things from fallout 4, but I think they should have used more of that music, especially since fallout 76 is only 25 years after the bombs dropped. Which means that the 1950s culture that was popular should be more evident in this game.. the one piece of music that does not belong in fallout 4 or 76 is the hideous Cole Porter number "Anything goes". 
---
What bothers me most, aside from the horrendous singing voice he had, is the fact that the song came out in 1934... which doesn't even fit with the theme of fallout 4.. which really borrowed from the 1950s.
---
So there is no way that anything goes should have shown up in any fallout game. 
---
I would like to hear a little bit more of the music on Rosie's radio.. and I think the jukeboxes need to be updated.. I love classical music and I love their choices of classical pieces, but they don't belong on a jukebox.
---
Yeah I just had a Vampires 25% faster fire rate, faster movement while aiming Ultracite Gatling Laser just disappear from my inventory. Couldn‚Äôt find it at all, just paid 30k caps for it too
---
Try the other Fallout games too. The first one I ever played was New Vegas on recommendation from a kid working at Game Stop. I was blown away. The Fallout world is so freakin awesome. I love the retro-futuristic vibe and the twisted humor. I‚Äôve always liked post apocalyptic stuff too, so the entire Fallout world is so up my alley. New Vegas hooked me in with the world, the lore, the awesome characters and quest story lines...like I say, it blew me away. Then I played Fallout 3, New Vegas again, then 4, now 76. I think it‚Äôs one of the best video game series ever made. 
---
AND...if you like dragon and swords type stuff, play any and all of the Elder Scrolls games. They are made by Bethesda (who make Fallout), and they are the exact same style of game, just with dragons, swords, and sorcery instead of post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland. Many would argue they are better than Fallout, but to me, Fallout is number one. 
---
Anyway...keep plugging away. It‚Äôs a great game with a good community. And consider the other games in the series. The more you know about the lore and the other games, the better it is. But even though this is the latest game out, it‚Äôs the first chronology, so you have a unique perspective that way if you play the other games. I would love to play them all for the first time ever, but in chronological order of the lore.
---
Electrically Charged + Unstable Isotope + Strange in Numbers
---
Strange in numbers fusion both mutations, it's a bug since forever.
---
That is why I simply turn them into gamma rounds instead of trying to explosive bait a base. EB takes too long and me changing to gamma rounds is just an inconvenience to others.
---
Yes better to let the sneak commando guys one shot all the wendigo and not participate in the boss. I have litteraly no issues with this on pc
---
I regularly listen to NV, Nuka World and 76 radio on Spotify. While they don‚Äôt have the in-game versions of ‚ÄúTake Me Home, Country Roads‚Äù or ‚ÄúRing of Fire,‚Äù I prefer the originals anyway.
---
Yes! The scrapbox is now pretty much the entire reason why I will keep FO1st, and the tent was essential to me early in the game. I placed my tent outside of Foundation so I could jump from my camp in the forest to Foundation without paying. That saved me a lot of money.
---
The bonus atoms are nice, but I don't think I could survive without the scrapbox.
---
It did this to me yesterday. When I logged back in after dinner it was corrected. Proper loot bag and wheel.

I have enforcer and a regular shotgun, and I don't cripple as often as I theoretically should. I can stagger sometimes, but never cripple as far as I can tell. Something seems off.
---
If only, I appreciate the sentiment haha
---
Yeah screw the guys that actually use it but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason to grief someone‚Äôs base or harass someone for having an inactive one
---
The problem here is that now we've gotta grind something that we've previously already grinded, and thats bullshit. So I have to level up these legendary perks to output the same damage as before? That's like prestiging without the prestige, I'll give up legendary perks just so I don't have to regrind all the work I put in this year.
---
She was not good to me. I‚Äôm hoping today or tomorrow will be better
---
Where did I say that ping and Frames are d√©pendant ? 
---
But the result is the same : d√©lays in displaying object. And wheb you try to stick aim to this object, it diesnt working.

As I said, you seem to have never experienced what I speak of, good for you, but it doesnt mean it doesnt happen to ogher players. And yes, beleive it or not, when the game allmost freezer you cant aim consistently

New to fo76, they have trap camps??

I'm in love with this shot I took from the Crosshair. I'm not the best photographer but I think it came out alright.
---
Nice....
---
Great, thanks
---
Nah, no point. It's not doing any processing to generate ammo so it doesnt take up server space. I think thats the main reason why the ammo factory up north is so secluded from everything else.
---
Yeah it seems like it doesn‚Äôt happen for everyone but the majority seem to get chugged hard. Idk man I‚Äôm just tired of starting colossal problem or line in the sand and 3 people use Tesla‚Äôs and drop the rate to like 5
---
I tried to do a silo run around level 40 and got annihilated by assaultrons and the sentry bot.  I was put off of trying again until level 180 and I went through it twice in one day no issues.  Probably overkill but now I know where those damn turrets are located.

Stay in mine I did last night and got all screws I could because you don‚Äôt lose nothing and that chest at the end sucks

I don‚Äôt know what biv is if it‚Äôs a pc thing I can‚Äôt help I‚Äôm a ps4 user

Go play fallout 4 if you don‚Äôt wanna deal with pvp

Yeah also PvP. The dps is what counts in pvp
---
About 4 days ago I lost my main weapon... It was a three-star vampire 50 caliber.  One day, after doing a colossal problem, where it apparently did nothing to hurt Earl, but did keep me alive... I fast traveled back to my camp and as I was going through my inventory I discovered it was gone. I didn't drop it anywhere because I didn't die and I didn't drop anything intentionally... What happened to it, I will never know.
---
It was an essential part of my early game. I set it up right outside Foundation so I could fast travel there without paying. That allowed me to set up my camp where I wanted it, and still be able to travel quickly to a location where I could sell a bunch of shit I dont use.
---
I have only recently started to have a large amount of caps, so I have started to use it when I am wandering.
---
No, workshops should produce extra resources when someone else joins the claim.
---
It's supposed to be "rebuild America" not "shoot your neighbor in the face for a tin can."
---
Use radaway for mutations
---
You can get it from a workshop on the north side of the map. Just claim it and you should be able to get some. It‚Äôll take a bit. I‚Äôll grind some out for you considering I don‚Äôt have much to do until the new season starts lol
---
Sounds like what you‚Äôre wanting is similar to what TES and other MMO‚Äôs generally do. For better or worse, I doubt we‚Äôll see this change. There is a certain aspect of realism(albeit loose in some regards) that Bethesda has wanted to maintain. Shelters will be the closest we‚Äôll get to this, which we still know little about so it is possible it could be an underground instance or just instanced interiors to our structures. Bethesda wants their assets to be tied together by the WV map they created, and is trying to make it free more alive. If you were to allow players to build larger camps somewhere off map it would make their limited map feel even smaller.
---
I'd settle for the deliverer doing a comeback.
---
I'd probably kill myself. 
---
They need to actually add new weapons to the game. Like a gun runners arsenal update for 76
---
Last I checked they were curable with the mutation, even though they're not supposed to be, they've never fixed it.
---
My first character scrounged together some raider armor as soon as he was able for tough situations, so around level 15. 
---
My second character, who was ultimately a full-time PA wearing melee build, started out with level 25 excavator as soon as he could craft it, and now rocks ultracite (some saint was selling calibrated shocks modded legs so I bought a pair). It looks cool and protects pretty well, pairs well with the grounded mutation.
---
My third character, who was only going to use PA for nuke zones, earl, and lucky hole mine waited until he could craft max level excavator. He ended up being a tanky shotgunner though so I'm going for a set of T65.
---
This. So much this. And while they are at it, combine keys or delete duplicates.
---
I feel you bro, who gives a fuck that dude chose to impregnate some bitch that leaves his ass the moment his kids are born. Fuck outta here with this, its no wonder griefers reak havok on players, they're all a bunch of trash neckbeard betas
---
I'm on PS4 an can make the costume and hat for free.
---
Same with the skeleton. And civil war outfits.
---
I did think so idiot.
---
I'm particularly worried since I don't have any fancy gear. My shotgun isn't magic or explosive, I don't have Reduce Damage While Blocking armor (though I have no idea what that even does to make it magic), so I am worried I will be going through ammo like crazy and likely dying more often, which didn't happen before. I guess we'll see.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I made end game in a week. Shoulda wrapped it, bought her a plan B, or had her swallow like a real woman.
---
I've been wondering idly about the lack of 1st-specific atom shop stuff, thank you for posting!
---
I purchased the annual subscription when it first came out, very glad I did. Occasionally I will get on the public server when I need to do group events.. but honestly the majority of my time is on a private server playing the game without any interference.
---
I thought it meant that too.
---
I can give ya one, and anyone else, one if they want!
---
I‚Äôm also stuck here. 
---
I was able to insert the ghoul blood at some point and the fuse but it still didn‚Äôt work. 
---
Now I don‚Äôt have any ghoul blood and I can‚Äôt gather any new ghoul blood. I guess because I did it already?

I‚Äôm very curious about this emptiness, what does a god game make you feel after you‚Äôve participated its boss fights? Everlasting joy and eternal life?

Hi, if you send me your PSN I will send you a request, I can give you some bits to help you level up. I am in the UK but do play from around 4pm through the night due to my husbands shift pattern but am happy to help out if you are on. Intelligence is what you want for levelling quickly. I can give you military fatigues which have +3 intelligence, and there are a few foods and drinks that can help too. Keep an eye out for armor with +1 intelligence too.
---
Yes they are viable. I have a bloodied commando and I typically use stealth, but I have no issues when stealth is broken. You don't get the stealth bonuses in the boss fights anyway since they are engaged with other players in the event.
---
Someone using a bloodied weapon, which does more damage the lower your health is.  You then outfit perks like Nerd Rage and Serendipity to maximize survivability  and rad yourself up to reduce hit points.
---
bloodied is still much strong, but that is clearly somewhere around 55%. Nowhere near double
---
New instrument weapons, maybe a violin crossbow?
---
No doubt.  I don't use the magic stuff I have on public servers at all but it has gotten pretty out of hand.  Every queen is a race to get enough hits in before someone melts her to get credit.  I've seen so many lower level players get screwed out of rewards from it though.
---
Personally I screw myself out of rewards.  Just did SBQ that also made collosal problem trigger and in my efforts to make the mine timer I fast traveled before getting credit for scorched earth like a dumb ass.  Wanted that flux too lol.

I was hopping around camps last week looking for plasma grenade plans.  Found one but was just shy of vendor costs.  I got on my mic and asked if we could make a deal with my other items.  He gave it to me for free.  I was so happy cause it was last item I needed for one of the badges.  I did drop a lot of stuff for him though that he could resell to recoup.   
---
I love the people in this game.  99% positive. :)
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
I miss the having the key ring instead of a hundred keys scattered throughout my misc tab
---
I still have 7 of some key from the Watoga region...please take it away.  That damn holotape too
---
It's over.
---
Not relevant but okay.
---
Nope. Also not possible to buy right now.
---
Sorta will. Insta still does double but it‚Äôs not being multiplied against anything else anymore. So just a flat 100% boost on your base damage with everything else added onto it
---
I generally keep 2 shot and quad. Its big value is freezing, and those do it better.
---
Has season 2 started??
---
That‚Äôs a damn good gun
---
Mine works fine last time I checked...
---
Its good but I wouldn't say rare
---
Or use photo mode if you dont use power armor.
---
Do you mean the one with a certain initiate missing an eye?
---
I play a ton and trade a lot with other players. I could not play without FO1. The ability to trade things with my other characters in a private world is almost as invaluable as the scrap box.
---
Did you look at the actual damage numbers in the chart that was hyper linked in that post?
---
Lvl 100 supermutant 108 damage from bloodied, 57 damage from junkies.  Thats nearly twice the damage.
---
Thanks, I will hold on to it
---
They do this on purpose. Almost every item they sell has flaws, either false advertising or isnt working. The only thing they fixed as far I know was the water wheel and this also took 2 months. 
---
Don't think they want this game to be good or even flawless, that's not their intention with fallout 76.
---
So annoying not to be able to switch quickly between weapons fighting earl or the sbq, using the wheel and equipping the wrong weapon...
---
You didn't notice that all the objects you place inside of it are floating?
---
You definitely should. Guns like that are worth a lot of caps and vampires weapons are increasingly popular nowadays
---
Same
---
No im a level 76, but he had a vendor in a small room behind an open powered do, he must have floor spikes glitch connected to the door because when he activated the door, i was killed instantly by floor spikes.
---
They aren‚Äôt floating on my screen and my friends didn‚Äôt see any floating
---
There are different types. Some are cleverly designed and automated so that once you enter you get ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô and take damage from things like Tesla Arcs or Flamethrowers (so you can‚Äôt fast travel away) and once you die the owner collects your junk. 
---
Then there are the people that have blueprinted punji board stacks and while you‚Äôre distracted (like at their vendor machine), they drop the blueprint and it kills you within seconds. 
---
Always store your junk before exploring. If you see a stash box, stash your junk. Always. Even if you‚Äôre positive you stash your junk 10 seconds ago... stash it again.
---
Its five points on a special per max legendary perk. Up to six of the seven specials can be increased in a build for a total of 30 added points up from 67 you have at level 50. You cant use it to go over 15 card slots per special. My if you have multiple over 10 already you could always respec the points. To get to having six maxes though you will need to get to lv up to a little under 650 level.
---
Kinda thinking the same thing. How many games do you continue playing on the same character after you beat the big bad? Yet I‚Äôm still killing earl daily. Seems like personal preference/bias if you‚Äôre not enjoying the endgame more than it being the fault of the creators.
---
Oof your comment belongs in r/cringe .  As if I‚Äôd ever prefer a video game over a family.  Check your priorities mate.
---
When you look at all the items added since the beginning and all the patches/fixes/enhancements that broke things and that are still broke, the bunker is close to the bottom of the list of things to be fixed. I don't know why they don't care about their product.
---
Hmm?
---
I wouldn't sell it for caps, more trade only
---
Excuse me?
---
What where you asking?
---
I would also say so but recently but heavy guns like were massively duped so I'm not sure they're worth much for trade anymore. The market is in kinda a bad place
---
Stop being a tool.
---
I use wireless internet
---
It‚Äôs already been addressed in tests by multiple other players. Bloodied is going to be doing roughly 70% of a mutant weapon. I‚Äôd rather trust the majority over a post that tested 3 weapons and has numbers that don‚Äôt match.
---
I don‚Äôt use an Ethernet cable but thank you for the help
---
I asked "what?"
---
Like what do you mean? "Or what? Are you serious? Reduce obtainable scrips?"
---
There you go then...
---
not exactly rare, but a great weapon for tanking and still being able to maintain decent DPS.
---
FFR, mainly for PvP reasons.
---
The limb damage isn't a bad one if you want to cripple enemies in the process, although I'm not sure if the lightning attempts to latch onto any specific limb.  It does provide a chance to stagger them though, I think, so it's potentially useful against Ghoul mobs and things like that.
---
not till patch 22
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
That would be neat.
---
We also need things like the actual sniper rifle, 1911, grease gun, single shotgun, classic assault rifle, service rifle, assault carbine, laser rcw, telsa canon and obviously some more instrument weapons.
---
Ya so that you could give more legendaries to the machine.
---
I'm not saying choose a video game over a family idiot, I'm saying choose freedom over a family especially when your wife leaves you like the bozo who posted this. That reply deserves r/cringe more than my comment, but then again this is what happens when you have kids you stop thinking for yourself.
---
Well then your lucky because you'd be the only one.  Can you link a pic?
---
Kinda want to go find a trap house now tbh thank you for the info!
---
Whew. Haven't logged in a few weeks. Wanted to make sure I didn't miss the new season start atleast. Got annoyed with the grind. Wven tho I wanted captain cosmos, ill just make sure I get this BoA gear this season. (If its still BoA themed)
---
Nice
---
There is a (barely) marked exit in one corner of Earle's arena.  If you follow the train tracks, you'll find it.  It has spinning yellow lights around it when it's time to escape.  Why Bethesda chose to obscure it as badly as they did, I have no idea.
---
Ideally, though, you can just stick around and let the mine collapse on you.  It doesn't count as a death, and you'll just be teleported outside Monongah Mine (potentially into a Nuke Zone) with all of your loot intact.  The only thing you miss out on is a small assortment of useless ore in the red box, but you get everything else, including potentially hundreds of Screws.
---
Literally me. If anything I just use what I get from her to sell at my vendor but that's about it. I've used the same legendaries for a long ass time now lol
---
Have links? What do you mean mutant weapons?
---
I fallow the PTS forum very closely and theres been no mention of mutants changing what so ever.
---
The Brotherhood of Asteel
---
No.
---
Currently out of town but when I get a chance to hop back on I will!
---
Explosive shotgun! Cheap ammo and tags everyrhing in a horde
---
Why?
---
From out my friend's front door in Oregon.  Almost looks like the Vault-Tec rep will be knocking on doors soon.

If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I‚Äôve got extra of everything but the super rare masks. I occasionally sell one of each for 150 caps. If there‚Äôs any specific ones you‚Äôre looking for, I can help you out.
---
Damn, that's a very nice collection!
---
Probably should have done the year over monthly. The year is cheaper over long periods of time the monthly just steals from your wallet.
---
How it not relevant, disease cure wont cure mutatiins hut radaway will
---
now it is called "Armor Ace" for season 2. but they changed the menu button to just be called "SCOREBOARD" [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons)
---
Thx, still trying to get more.
---
 Bless you that‚Äôs awesome thanks, hopefully get a crew of people to play with. The intelligence thing might be why I‚Äôm struggling this time round. Maybe I had different clothes or a different deck of cards and had more intelligence lol.
---
My PSN ID is FameSpear.
---
Send me a request and I will accept it as soon as I can! Thanks for your help üòÄ
---
Absolutely not, increase amount you can turn in/collect during sale instead
---
So should I switch to a wired connection?
---
I think they should *reduce* the limit to 40. That way we'll keep playing for longer. I mean nothing makes me want to play like having more stringent limits to keep me coming back.
---
Mob specific armor sets will be an important thing for bloodied stealth builds.
---
Ha they scared the crap out of me! Just pop out of nowhere!
---
This is without a doubt, the worst idea I've ever heard.
---
You might as well just give away your extra legendaries when you cap out. Same result for you, plus you make other players happy. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I had the same problem. It was solved by server hopping, and finally a private server let me do it. I also did the analysis on the PC before the T-fuse, I am not sure, but I think that helped me.
---
I was gonna offer my help too as a father of 13 and 11. I understand the grind and struggle, but I am on PS4.
---
What about something like that:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTrCoVouCBc&amp;ab\_channel=KloneWolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTrCoVouCBc&amp;ab_channel=KloneWolf)  
---
Lets call it a special kind of race.
---
Thx for the tips ppl!! I'll start a transition to PA build
---
Well my base has been across the street from there for months. Come in for the free workbenches, stay for the outrageous deals!
---
This just increases the grind.
---
Did you have to collect more blood or was it somehow still in the analyzer thing for you?  I still have the fuse.
---
‚Äú...why does it need marked anyway?‚Äù 
---
Who are you, Derrick Taylor?
---
The only ones you make light er by bulking is aluminium and lead. The rest you bulk to sell
---
Cancel auto renew, that's the only way. That makes since though because you bought 1 month of it, you get 1 month of it.
---
If you login when the atom shop is unavailable, things revert to default (same thing happens when you login on PTS because there is no atom shop).
---
I explained why I started with monthly in my post.
---
Just curious because others have also suggested a private server.  What is different on a private server that may allow me to complete the quest where a public server will not?
---
Cool, man, thanks, that's what I'll do, and I'll set a calendar reminder for 10/1 to do the yearly sub.
---
I‚Äôm in the U.K. my PSN is Madrajin the community in 76 can be really supportive. Feel free to add me if you want someone else to give you a hand, mention Reddit in the request üòâ
---
still in the analyzer thing. I also tried to get more blood, but that was not possible
---
If the internet is coming into your property wirelessly (like a mobile phone), then that's the issue, if the internet is coming into your property via a copper or fibre cable, then it doesn't really matter if you connect to the router via wire or wireless (but wired is better).
---
It's how the internet reaches the property/your router that matters, not how you connect to the router.
---
I can imagine. But probably not so easy to sell.
---
Aluminum and lead are the only things that save weight from bulking.
---
Use against wendigo adds in the Collosal Problem event. You won't die ever again, however you would be better served with a 50 cal or lmg due to the mini gun spin up.
---
That brings on a whole new meaning to the phrase 'the floor is lava'....
---
The benefits actually improved recently. We get something new and unique each month (like the rug, the sleazy bed, the new skin for the armor workbench). 
---
Also the Red Rocket Garage came back but only for FO1st members. 
---
We get discounts on certain items as well. The Red Ranger Power Armor bundle? 20% off only for FO1st members. 
---
It‚Äôs far better now than when it was ‚ÄòLook, have another skin did the CPD Riot Armor‚Äô or ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a skin for the survival tent‚Äô.
---
Someone here said it has to be on a server where this quest has not been done since the server was rebooted.
---
Just wait till the BoS bunker gets here ü§î
---
Lay off the crack jack.
---
I just got a minigun: Bloody, 25 fire rate. 1 perception.  Eny thoughts?
---
I live in Chico California which neighbors Paradise California and is now dealing with the complex fire. It never ends in Norcal.
---
Thanks, this is really good news.  I hope it works. 
---
It‚Äôs super frustrating to grind without actually playing the game.
---
Well, the last remaining of fallout 76's origin finally did something good to someone. I miss the workshop fights from the early days
---
I would have to see that. Never heard of a tesla one shotting anyone at full up.
---
OP didn‚Äôt ask about curing mutations. They asked about ***curing diseases***, and if having the Plague Walker mutation prevented that. 
---
Nothing indicated they wanted to get rid of Plague Walker.
---
Workshop posts usually consist of people crying about getting killedüòÇ
---
Horrible idea
---
Makes sense, thank you very much!
---
This^^
---
Go back inside or wear your mask, very bad for you.
---
Get a refund. I'm sure once they notice enough people are requesting refunds over how broken it is, they'll do something about it (not really, but we can hope, right?)
---
It'll probably be a reskin of deliverer
---
that was a ppk
---
Oh I was killed haha!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Assorted_lights
---
reddit users do not represent the average player sweaty
---
new vegas had the garand, 1911, and 9mm ammo so they could do it
---
Weirdly in sf the orange sky day wasn‚Äôt the worst for Aqi, today‚Äôs it‚Äôs visibly less apocalyptic but aqi is significantly worse
---
My mistake, you dont have to be so jerky about it, but hey you be you,
---
This is what I do! I wait until I'm almost out of the mine and switch over to my hazmat suit using favorites wheel. Works like a charm for me, no rads üëç
---
I've tried the spots it says, they didn't have it
---
I wish they buff the smg and add the Maria (Fallout: New Vegas) skin for the M1911
---
Only fix I know is a private server. Plenty of people on here will help, just ask them.
---
I only use monthly subscription, and sometimes I cancel it and instead of continue the one I start a new sub since the old isnt able to activate sometimes.
---
I never had a skip of my current sub when choosing a new subscription, so I guess you won't either.
---
But as always when real money is involved, ask the support. They react within hours when it's about money.
---
Add Uhni. :)
---
Camp placement should take precedence over tent placement.
---
Basically the problem is that there‚Äôs something wrong that after one person does it, no one else can. So, going on a private guarantees no one else has done it.
---
1911s that use .45 ammo and paint it the way you'd want it (maybe add a "light in shining darkness" skin in the atom shop?)
---
You can't do anything else though, you have to be stuck staring at that screen and the tiny text. I'd love it to be a dump everything and come back later system.
---
I craft my ammo in around 5000 blocks at a time, I would go insane trying to match that with this thing.
---
I‚Äôd buy them from ya and sure any are welcome they don‚Äôt have to be super rare and yes I‚Äôm on xbox
---
How do y‚Äôall get so many legendary items?
---
1000 max , :(
---
You can be viable with zero legendary items. If you dont feel like min-maxing you'll still be totally fine. Fun is far more important than peak performance in a game like this.
---
The rare mining helmet you can get as a drop from the Colossal Problem event seriously wouldn't look out of place in Wolfenstein.  It resembles the eerie silhouettes on the cover to The New Order.
---
Nothing I said was jerky. It was simply clear and direct. 
---
If clear and direct bothers you, that‚Äôs unfortunate.
---
Agreed.  I had to sell a bunch last night due to the terrible purveyor rolls.  Then I hit my caps limit, and am hovering close to my stash limit.
---
1000 max :(
---
It was way better than expected! The excitement of searching around the powerplant for eachother, not knowing if youd get shot in the face, back or from above! Havent had that feeling once in the oh so dangerous wasteland
---
More World War 2 weapons in general would be fantastic. But the M1911 is my #1.
---
You sound absolutely awful.
---
Your first comment "thats irrelevant" was kinda jerky, I misread his title, simple mistake but you had be sure to get your smartass remark in, but hey like I said you be you.
---
The one thing about Fallout 1st that doesn't make sense (along with the discounts not being shown as 1st), is that if you don't currently have 1st, it doesn't show what you could have in the Atom Store by getting 1st.  I had 1st for one month in February, it shows me what I have, but none of what is available.
---
This is the main selling point for almost all micro transactions is that you get a "preview" of the product and are enticed to buy it.  I know you get a private server and unlimited junk space, its just odd that the cosmetics especially "timed" cosmetics aren't shown off to those currently without fallout 1st.
---
I agree on the workshops, if its due to server status, or just intensive work they should just make an Auto Place Blueprint tab for each workshop, only available for 1st members.  All this would do is when logging out all of your current workshops are saved to this tab.  These Blueprints would be un editable, and would be automatically placed when taking the workshop its saved to on the next server, it also places itself exactly as it was (this saves the hassle of trying to place it yourself, and due to extractors).  You can then edit the workshop once placed and the game will save over the previous blueprint when logging out again.
---
Oh, I ran into that vendor a bunch of times before I finally got the outfit one. Are you Xbox? I was able to get a witch costume and clean ranger suit from her. I don't think the other stuff was rare, but I bought her whole stash ha. You're welcome to one of those if you'd like! No charge.
---
Try closing the game and then opening it, hoping on a public world, go to the terminal, make sure the T-type fuse is installed but don‚Äôt put the blood sample in to the centrifuge. Go straight into terminal and analyze. It should work then. A friend of mine figured it out, he plays on Xbox, I tried it and it worked, I play on PS4, and another friend tried it on PS4 and worked then too. My brother did it on PC and it also worked. He was using the steam version. Hope this helps
---
And one Wasteland &amp; legendary perk
---
Only to neckbeards like yourself mate
---
Yeah and the light source is floating behind your right shoulder I swear, not even coming from the helmet.
---
Not even remotely the same
---
Worse than I remembered. I barely play at all any more.
---
What do we want? Key ring! When do we want it? Now!
---
Yes I‚Äôm on Xbox and I know when i got straight he jacket I bought everything even if not rare. I‚Äôve ran into her all the time at least once a day but never clothes. But that day I got straight jacket I had to join someone to just get that. There‚Äôs three spots I find her at and most times it‚Äôs chem recipes
---
Dude had a base full of em and he was selling over 100mil nuka cola quantums.
---
Because people are still paying for it and the microtransactions. Surely, if they were doing something wrong, the money wouldn't still be rolling in.  /s
---
It can be great. It really can. 
---
I had a workshop battle at Dolly Sods Campground during the wood collection part of the BoS event.
---
The score ran up 2-2 before my XBOX glitched out.
---
I loved Maria, in NV. Would be amzing to have her back. This song expresses excatly how i feel. 
---
https://youtu.be/fZSiBj4vCiY
---
And now its stuck in my head... but god damn do i love me aome B&amp;D.
---
i had no idea it wasn't legit.. i honestly thought it was the raider ammo machine i was grinding towards  lmao
---
I‚Äôd keep hitting up player vendors and not pay more than 100ish caps for it.
---
yes keep happening, the game even thinks I'm not subbed to 1st even though I purchased it 1 week ago ...
---
Everything we ask them to do? Bug fixes, scrip &amp; vendor limit changes, cut some of the grind. Another top post today is how it's taken two months of playing everyday to finally complete this latest season. I will place good money this post will be written by somebody else in the next week. It reaches the top of the sub so much, sometimes people loads of people agree and I get upvoted to oblivion, the others I meet players like you who are complaining, I offer a solution and your answer is, "They're not going to do everything we ask them" well what's the solution then? Make another post into this echo chamber lol
---
Your reply *wasn‚Äôt* relevant. That‚Äôs not an insult. It‚Äôs a just a factual statement. 
---
Again, if a simple statement of fact is offensive to you, that‚Äôs unfortunate. But that is a ‚Äòyou problem‚Äô, not a ‚Äòme problem‚Äô. 
---
If I had said *‚ÄòNo, you stupid idiot, RadAway doesn‚Äôt do anything about diseases. Learn to read, moron.‚Äô* that would have been jerky. 
---
You‚Äôre projecting emotionalism into the first comment. That‚Äôs on you. Not me. 
---
Have a good day.
---
I think you just have to keep trying &amp; server hopping. I was looking for a particular plan also and tried the locations the wiki suggested and it took me a while, but finally got it. If someone else in the server buys it before you, it won't be there to purchase anymore I'm assuming
---
Shoot at anything outside of vats. If you see each pellet do different damage then it's magic. If you shoot in vats and can't read the damage, that means each pellet did different damage and it's magical. If you can read the number then it's not.
---
You are a legend bro! Thank you so soo much!! This camp is a awesome setup too.
---
Also, update the personal terminal to remind you about all the dailies, not just Biv or the Scout Master.
---
XP... everything is about XP, kill or tag everything as fast as possible at all times, play the game in a team for the buffs but essentially solo, other players are of no importance.
---
All the Alpha and Beta keys!
---
That‚Äôs pretty much why I just always run a mic whether I‚Äôm in a party or game chat. Can easily switch between the 2 Incase I need to communicate with someone. I like that the area chat can be heard by anyone within bounds. I had a guy try to communicate with me through emotes even though he had a mic since I couldn‚Äôt hear him. 
---
He was low level so I assumed him to either be new or someone who started another build. I quickly realized he was new once I had to explain to him how to go into audio settings and make sure his chat volume/ master chat or whatever it is was all the way up. Afterward I could hear him and he tagged along while a friend and I were just running dailies. Even helped him build his base with a fusion generator to power all of his stuff, some defense turrets, and decor to make it look nice.
---
Edit: Everyone seems to run their bloody builds differently....
---
I use healing factor mutation to avoid stims. 
---
Usually I end up with like 100s of supers and Even more regulars.
---
If I do have to use them I only use them when I‚Äôm inches from death ... || &lt;- like maybe less than that lol .
---
Is your weapon using an alternative ammo type (e.x. .38 receiver on a .45 weapon)?  Not sure the cause but If it is this problem your ammo inventory tab shows both .45 and .38 equipped from the example
---
If that's the case I found I had to drop/store then reloot the ammo that is not the type the receiver uses to fix it (e.x. receiver is .38, had to store the .45).   Should fix it until the next time the receiver is changed
---
Please ask a courier on the market subbreddit
---
That's what I was starting to think, ive been pretty lucky finding stuff on the first attempt, but I guess my luck ran out lol
---
If you have more than you can use just drop them for someone else.
---
You know this game has a website, right?bethesda.net
---
All I get are heavy automatic weapons.  Which I know is -the- build, but it's not mine.
---
Got 5 of them today and one combat rifle.
---
I don't know about effects, though.  Usually rotates between mutated, junkies, and zealot.  It's not a good system.
---
I just want a weapon I can use.
---
The dam is the one I tried day after day with no luck. Fingers crossed the monument works out. Thank you so much! Someday it's going to be mine!
---
Wait, what? I run solo but I have a Medic's Handmade as my primary. Do I actually have to be that close to a teammate for them to get healed by my crit?
---
I'm on PC and it is a reproducible issue with ash piles, my PC runs cool.
---
I've had pairs of almost identical rolls more times than I remember, or doing multiple rolls and getting large biases towards specific weapon types (eg 8/10 being heavy weapons). Yes you'll get it very occasionally but with multiple weapon/armour families and a pool of effects for each of 3 slots the odds of getting twins is very low, and twin after twin after twin should be astronomical. 
---
Last night I exchanged for 10x 3* ranged weapons and was actually amazed at the variety. There were repeated weapon and similar effects but importantly not on concecutive rolls and certainly not as twins which is almost unheard of.
---
And I have noted its not just the Purveyor where it happens - crafting, random critter drops, event rewards all have given me almost identical concecutive items.
---
Not the case here. Just a fixer I haven‚Äôt primed. Weird stuff. That‚Äôs a good thought tho.
---
It may not have been relevant but it was a mistake, I unlike you dont feel the need to go online and give people shit over a mistake, I'm not offended at all, I made a response to a post I misread you in the other hand had to be a jerk about it, I couldnt care less.
---
Same. Have been stuck here for months. I've tried all the different things they suggest. I can't get it to work.
---
By all means, if posting about it helps you sleep at night, then go for it. All I'm saying is we aren't dealing with Bethesda anymore. This is ZeniMax. Everything is a cost/benefit problem for them. Making the changes you're asking for will cost them money, and there's no way for them to charge for it. It doesn't lead to more sales, it doesn't sell new copies. New content does. Exposing people to the atom shop every day does. Removing some of the grind for a monthly fee does.
---
Too bad. We had a good one too. Like 6-4 or 6-5 to his favor
---
Plans you know don‚Äôt matter besides fixer, SS, etc
---
I doubt that, mainly because of the mods and different caliber. I personally think the ‚Äúclassic 10mm pistol‚Äù from Fallout 4 creation club would be much more likely to be a skin for the 10mm
---
Yes you basically have to hug them to heal them with it!
---
At that point you may as well use a friendly fire shishkebab, it'll be faster!
---
This is how Fallout 3 bartering worked but in Fallout 76 there is no underselling for the seller's last currency which sucks
---
You can pm your gt if you want, and if I find her again I can let you know!
---
Fuck right off with that idea.
---
*wont
---
Really appreciate and I‚Äôll do same as I know she changes her stock when ppl join. I‚Äôll pm you
---
Yeah I lost out on my rewards for Encyptid because the game tabbed out right as we won and I couldn't get back.
---
Happened 2 different times now where I take Posiedon Energy Plant and the game crashed 30 seconds later.
---
Lost all my junk since the game tabbed out in combat, I died, then couldn't tab back in to collect my junk.
---
Aw, boo. That's a disappointing. I was thinking about changing my build to support my friend if he ever comes back to the game, but I guess I can't rely on that weapon.
---
It's most like Diablo 3. Each world is different t, has a relatively low player limit ans there's no requirement to play with others if you don't want to.
---
Everyone is farming for the best versions of certain weapons, and there are various builds - though it is harder to switch in Diablo due to the class system. Optimized builds are somewhat extreme, even to the point of not being thst much fun to play (my opinion, of course).
---
50 Poison Resist
---
I've been relatively crash free, until I had one a couple of days ago. A turret at a workshop I'd taken over took a dislike to Grahm. After some shots back and forth between them, the game crashed.
---
I always report it when its that insane. Jesus louise, poor server lol
---
I keep saying this. I feel like they are a very vocal minority of the total community
---
And I gave you a chance to correct yourself. Your second post was still incorrect. 
---
You gave ***inappropriate advice*** based upon the question.  I pointed that out.  Not to embarrass you but to give you an opportunity to correct yourself and to point out to anyone that read your post that it was faulty advice 
---
I didn‚Äôt give you shit about it. The fact that you took it that way is on you, not me. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure why you have a chip on your shoulder and are trying to tell me how to post here. But you definitely took it the wrong way. As I said, that‚Äôs unfortunate and wasn‚Äôt my intent.
---
I requested a refund and got my atoms back 3 days later. Can still the bunker too, not that I‚Äôm going to until it‚Äôs fixed. If enough request refunds they‚Äôll be more on the ball to fix it. Enough people spoke up with the treasure hunter hat and insurgent hat removing eyewear and facial hair and that was fixed after about a month it‚Äôs release. And those were in game items.
---
Jesus could you just answer the goddamn question
---
Right and half the time they don't want the workshop or the junk they just want someone to fight with them. I know the risks and accept them.
---
They added the sexy and legendary MG42, might as well add this while they‚Äôre at it
---
If they really wanted to gate the ability to just spam buy purveyor rolls, they should have done it by limiting the number of legendary rolls you could buy, not the number you could trade in. (Ie, you can only trade in x script per day, or only X amount of each legendary roll is available each day).
---
By limiting the trade in they leave you with worthless legendaries you just want to scrap taking up stash space.
---
Maybe it was done in the hopes there'd be an active economy trading them by folks who needed to get space, but everyone is at their script limit so they don't want to buy.
---
Unless the idea
---
Yes and the modded 7 shot, bloodied explosive that one  taps the hordes is totally fine..... 
---
I use a 2 shot tesla and have no lag at all on my end. Not going to stop using it because someones pc can't handle it.
---
Do the explosive ones do it also? If so im guilty ill put it away for now and use my be 50
---
Yeah I've been searching like crazy, the hunt continues!
---
50% less damage on average for bloodied builds is not 'nothing to be worried about'.
---
What was the message?    If the silo mentioned lock out or lock down. It means someone else launched from that silo and it is in a cool down phase.    You should be able to use another.
---
Like in NW, it's a little closer to an even playing field. But I've never once got to fight, I get snipped by someone who's invisible, that's not pvp that's assassination.
---
Wow... Honestly we'll said mate, seriously. I couldn't agree more. You nailed it big time. A lot of people try and come with this argument but give no detail as to why then get mad with the comments but you've explained and made every right point, I've gone to make posts like this but never really knew how to explain it, as a pvper who understands 100% what you mean I appreciate the time it took to write this mate. Good on you, I expect down votes and arguments but everything you said is what the majority of pvpers want. Cheers.
---
Enjoy your weekend and take care. üëçüçªüòÉ
---
I think it‚Äôs because of the season is over
---
I didn't even realize. Thank you
---
So then why post this? By your own admission they're not going to change it lol my point is, if we're going to keep seeing the exact same posts, why not act on it instead of saying the same thing over and over and upvoting it/ having the same discussion? It wastes more time than seasons.

---
I had this happen to me yesterday. I run bloodied, in an SBQ fight a gulper got me while firing at the queen and I got stimmed... all of a sudden I'm watching my rads go away in a panic wtf happened?!?!?! Then I figured it out. That queen fight took longer than they usually do.
---
Np next season is coming soon
---
This happens to me as well and it bothers me :( I‚Äôm not too sure if it‚Äôs a bug
---
It‚Äôs anecdotal, but I‚Äôve been having an extremely hard time keeping CAMP plans in stock lately. It could be a flood of new players who started when 76 went to XBOX Game Pass finally starting to flex their caps.
---
That's not right, it's the 12th now.
---
I get most of my misc plans from Whitespring or Watoga. Both locations have their station vendors plus others just a quick run away. Players vendors may often be cheaper (but not always!) but you are more likely to need a good slice of luck to find the less in demand/dropped plans. Also by using Bots it's possible to play the various daily/player limits off against each other much easier.
---
No chip on my shoulder, just misread the title, not trying to argue or be a dick just pointing out what I read, was the advice bad yeah but again I misread the title, either way no point bitching for the rest of the day, I'm not embarrassed I am fine having mistakes pointed out.
---
Hologape board??  Is there like a camp
---
Thing for storing tapes.    Especially those overseer ones
---
Next Tuesday they will be back when new season drops!
---
Thank you. This is it! 
---
Does server hopping help?
---
It was already answered by u/Arsenic_Touch. And I was trying to help you avoid using faulty advice. 
---
But here‚Äôs the answer again:  While diseases should *not* be cured when you have Plague Walker, that‚Äôs not how it works right now. Diseases can be cured while you have Plague Walker, either through Disease Cures, Antibiotics or the Water Fountain at the Whitespring Gazebo.
---
Yes I believe you can still cure disease with the plauge walker mutation.
---
Your strength affects your Carry weight.  To that End, melee build with  15 base strength, and after bonuses for SS underarmor, add/subtract for various mutations, motion assist servos in the PA... pip boy says it is around 20.
---
  I finished my SS armor set last night.  All deep pocketed.  With the high capacity backpack, my base carry weight is 445
---
Assuming OP didn't toss it or sell it, always check the "missile silo state holotape" you are given from the enclave quest before bothering to head to any silos.  It's possible for there to not be any active nuke zones but all three silos could still be in cool down.
---
Anytime I plan on launching nukes I check the status first thing and then jump servers if needed.
---
I‚Äôve only seen it happen 100% of the time when you swap accounts on your system. So if my girlfriend logs in on my Xbox it will reset emojis and I have reselect them on the atom shop.
---
Bloodied is still melting everything and I don't see any problem. There are numerous videos now on YouTube showing that there isn't much difference. Only thing that ppl can't do is 2 shot an end game boss lol. Nothing bad about that whatsoever.
---
Yeah I got a medics explosive fixer and planned to heal people in the Earle fight, I couldn't heal anyone unless I was up close to everyone.
---
Then let the mistake be pointed out (which is all I did), accept it, and move on. 
---
All good?
---
It's in the skins tab of the atom shop I believe.
---
quad, vampire, bloodied are really nice, especially vampire since it accounts every pellet fired, then its more freely
---
Welcome - I also created my account for similar reasons. Every time I was googling for help in Fallout or Red Dead Redemption, I ended up often getting the most useful responses on Reddit.
---
Sadly, this response might not be super-useful for you (apologies). I've not noticed the particular glitch you mentioned, however, a move I've made recently is to remove turrets from my CAMP set-up altogether.
---
According to lots of folk on here, they take up a lot of CAMP budget, but don't really offer a great deal in return.
---
Obvs, if you feel your turrets are worth the budget cost, keep them. I've found I've been mostly okay without them since I removed them.
---
Hopefully someone else with a similar buggy turret experience will join in here with a more useful response.
---
Did you actually decrypt the codes?
---
I‚Äôm sick of dropping 3* or 2* guns and armour daily. Get rid of the limit full stop including bullion and caps
---
Not if it still is the most effective build and still easily destroys everything
---
YA LIKE ME
---
Is it necessary?
---
I'm just upset I didn't have the option to get offended when she complained about them eating each other.  What's a little light cannibalism between friends?
---
Well, just playing the game. Do events, most of those grant you a legendary item in the end, some of those give you two if you hit boss.
---
It's doesn't do it as easily but it hasn't made it impossible like people think. Watch the video and see, I'm making a point that the nerf isn't bad. People think they're doomed and gonna be firing marshmallows but they're not, the only people who may get hurt are speed runners if anyone but there will be ways still.
---
Welcome to the murky world of turrets. They do have an annoying tendency to be blind to enemies although oddly the moment you spot them they wake up again. It used to be far worse but was 'fixed' a few patches back. Same with the targeting of friendlies including merchants and at times even your own camp - it's improved but certainly not Fixed!
---
Well said and true, but in reality you would just change the unfairness to owners ..they should just remove it from Adventure mode and leave PvP for NW. Maybe bring back survival mode for the PvP players, at the end of the day they should of kept it, but because of a lazy dev team or lack of funding, they got rid of it. It was perfect I think conceptually .. but I agree workshops should be a fun place to be, it would allow a lot of creativity without all the wanna be pvp players who think they have skillz by shooting you in the back.
---
This is 100% a useful response! I placed my CAMP in a high-traffic area to make it accessible (the intersection of 64 and the railroad tracks), but it means I'm constantly having to deal with enemies attacking. 
---
The most annoying thing is to hear the distant "pop........pop" of a super mutant who apparently can outrange my missile turrets. :/
---
How would it make the map seem smaller?
---
mine was fixed in a weird unintentional way
---
decided to get rid of all my notes and holotapes to decrease the stash lag.
---
picked up all of them and when dropping I was able to drop the flincher farm one as well and it was no longer marked as a quest item.
---
upon booting the game again the note was not back. FINALLY!
---
Its an improvement over the current system but the limits are still a huge pita. I wish we could get an official statement on why the limits are in the game design
---
I‚Äôve never done that i just go to the site nukacrypt they have the codes so you won‚Äôt have to go threw the pain of decrypting it
---
Wow I never considered that, I‚Äôll go buy the game today
---
try to use the cable. Do you have wifi connection?
---
It can.   As mentioned there is a holo tape the will give you the states of the silos.    Look at that.   My rule of thumb is if I load into a world with no nuke zones, I pick a silo and go.   If there are nuke zones I hop.   Or I will check the holo tape and see which one is available.
---
Yeah I know about the site, I just thought that it was a necessary quest stage to actually decrypt them. However, I still cannot enter any silo.
---
Yes. Silo cooldown is server based.  3 hour cooldown on the server after a silo has been launched from.  Need to find another silo or a server where the silo you want isn't in cooldown.
---
Server hopping let me get past it both times. Took nine tries on the first character, four on the second. Try the terminal, doesn't work, exit, restart, run to terminal, doesn't work, exit... Don't bother with the fuse until the terminal works.
---
The north-facing door of AVR is closest to the terminal to save you a little time. Just gotta keep hammering at it until it works.
---
Good luck.
---
And yes server hopping can do the job just make sure the silos are ready
---
The links were unnecessary. I'm not saying that people aren't asking for it, and I'm not saying that I don't think that they should increase the limit. What I'm saying is people have been asking for this since it started. Nothing has changed because there's no profit in it for ZeniMax. Exactly the opposite actually, the limit is there to force you to log in every day, which exposes you to the Atom shop. They are driven by sales and profit and they're not going to change something that has been shown to increase their revenue.  It doesn't matter how many people ask or how frequently they ask, it's not going to change.
---
I have a quad gauss shotgun and it has 32 rounds.The other affects are +1 preception and limb damage.
---
Oh and i have a question.If i have limb dmg on a shotgun that means i can cripple faster right?But i have the enforcer perk already so is the limb damage really worth it?
---
I‚Äôd love a daily scrip limit of 500 with a max holding limit of 2000 or 3000, sometimes I get way too many legendaries I have to just drop them, stash box is full player is full. My mule has tooo many scrip weapons on them üòì
---
I keep thinking about how an M1 could work with the weapon mods system and be able to be fully converted into an M14 or a Mini 14
---
I haven't gotten any hate for being a healer tank yet.  Most people jump into my public team the second I announce that I have empath and team medic.  Just be ready for your overall damage output to be kinda meh unless you go junkies/use a strong legacy.  Also: Please don't use Medic's weapons.  They're not great, just use Team Medic to heal people and you'll be fine.
---
I guess literally playing the game and seeing for yourself isn't an option?
---
Tank
---
I think creating public pvp teams and buffing the output on public workshops would really help with organic pvp. Making these worth the effort to defend would be great.
---
After all...the toughest enemies in the game are other players.
---
And honestly......if you don't like pvp stay away from the public pvp team and workshops.
---
amaaazing blog, subscribed!!!!
---
You didn‚Äôt have to decrypt it all you needed is to know the code but it‚Äôs fine
---
Even if they don't want to get rid of the limits...just let us turn in the weapons/armor for tokens or some shit and we can only convert a certain number per day like the treasury notes.  It has taken me since the implementation of the legendary scrip until now to burn off the hundreds of accumulated weapons/armor i had been muling on my character (god bless 5x weapon weight reduction armor pieces).  It is such a shitty/dumb process.
---
Good idea, just be sure it's Skyrim.
---
That too, I posted that a long time ago, didnt want to rez my own post.
---
give me the easy upboats too
---
Hmm considering it hasn't been out for two years...
---
Anytime. And thanks. That should get you through the next 10 or so levels. Just keep an eye out for legendary armor. Most of the events with the exclamation mark give legendaries scaled to your level. Have fun.
---
Try both.  I‚Äôve been playing a 1H melee / high health build since I figured out builds.
---
PA, healing factor, and a vampire switchblade.  
---
When I Feel the need for some heavies, its either a vampire 50 or a  vampire gatling plasma.
---
I remember that from back when I used the regular turrets. They sucked. I'm using missile turrets now and my biggest complaint about them is they will randomly start shooting at a scorchbeast from the fissure sight from so far away that they aren't accurate at all but will sometimes lure him over to attack my camp.
---
I would if I could but I only have enough perk points for one
---
Bring back the M3 Grease gun, it was basically a machine pistol in New Vegas. Or they could do like an Uzi or Mac 10.
---
How are legacy weapons effected?
---
I'd gladly help vote or do anything to get that pistol in game
---
&gt;What I'm saying is people have been asking for this since it started. Nothing has changed because **there's no profit in it for ZeniMax.**   
---
&gt; **They are driven by sales and profit** 
---
Therefore, if we uninstalled fallout and cancelled f1st... They would see their profits hit and woud listen. 
---
&gt;It doesn't matter how many people ask or how frequently they ask, it's not going to change. 
---
So why put up the post in the first place? With respect, you're very very confused and your points are so far all over the place I wondered if you was trolling. I'm done ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm honestly welcoming it.  Whether bloodied/junkies/whatever build, the game right now is far too easy.
---
Always kill the baby crab. Instant meltdown
---
From what I can tell, NPC attacks only happen when you're at CAMP, if that helps - so you'll always be there to fight them off when they happen (if anyone looking at this thinks I'm wrong, please say so).
---
I think player attacks can happen at any time, but I'm yet to experience one at level 75.
---
As a fallout fan that's new to Reddit, I recommend also checking out the fo76 marketplace sub (helpful for pricing/trading legendary weapons), the fo76 build sub (for advice on how to spec your SPECIAL attributes and Perk cards), and FO76 filthy casuals (they're just good folks that enjoy the game but don't take it too seriously)
---
When you have a kid I don't have the time. Especially when I want to sleep cause I work 10 hrs from 4am-2 and come home to watch my kid and do stuff with her besides sit around and play games and make her watch a tablet or some shit. Nah. Its not.
---
By picking up a Blight
---
On it ü§ô
---
That bug has been around forever and has nothing to do with soloing. Sure, more people means more chances for someone to be able to loot the remaining cannisters, but I've had the event fail due to missing containers with 4 or 5 people actively looking for them.
---
Really though, with how abundant scrip is compared to the cap, does it matter much? You're essentially talking about being prevented from bending down to pick up a penny.
---
Weirdly I've not seen anyone test them... I imagine he will soon though as he and other have done ballistics. Be good to know. Going off ballistics though I still think legacy weapons will be OP, although AAE may be the top dog, TSE even.
---
limb dmg isnt that remarkable, if u can get one with ffr that would be amazing, or explosive (wich isnt wiable for gauss)
---
Or just have pvp automatically enabled for both parties...
---
Keep your creativity in your camp. If you want to waste your time decorating workshops, try private worlds
---
Definitely, same here. Much needed imo. üëçüçª
---
I bought 3 skyrim VRs how do I see the 2nd and 3rd legendary effects?
---
I don‚Äôt agree, I always felt that if they wanted to include PvP they need a new engine and game style. This is a pve engine, and the glitches, the crashes and game breaking bugs aren‚Äôt an environment conducive to enjoyable PvP.
---
If you are going to do pvp with this sort of engine, I don‚Äôt get why it isn‚Äôt instanced but available from the adventure mode.
---
Another feature that would make PvP more interesting is incorporating more of the environment. Hacking terminals to build additional defense, but under the stress that you can be killed.
---
Imagine a scenario in which one team has 4 minutes to build a defense (and need to coordinate on resources and workshop build) then another team attack, then reverse.
---
As it stands now PvP isn‚Äôt fair to the player who aren‚Äôt interested in the min-max grind. It‚Äôs also mechanically awful.
---
'effective' has several meanings. damage is just one of them. people fixate on dps way too much.
---
there are also several implications to bloodied dealing 50% less damage that went over your head. 'now it takes 2 shots to kill a super mutant, big deal' is the usual suspect. except, there are what? 50 of them in west tek, for example? that means a west tek run now takes twice as much ammo. and that's assuming you could one shot them in the first place.
---
turtle's video also implies that TS is performing better than B in a bloodied build, meaning that bloodied weapons are now worthless. specially if you consider that TS doesn't really require a build or you to be at low health. why play with 19% hp, or addicted to multiple chems, when TS and AA respectively will outperform you anyway?
---
and let's not forget about bosses. yeah, melee builds can one shot them when buffed to hell and back and under optimal circumstances that are staged specifically for youtube views. but realistically speaking it takes thousands of rounds of your preferred ammo to kill Earle. now multiply that by 2. yeah, fun.
---
I found a guy with 100's at a workshop so i went invisible and changed the ammo type and emptied them all, after he caught on started a workshop claim and destroyed them all and killed him for 15 minutes, i then posted it on xbox lfg page and about 10 people showed up and pestered his workshop until he left. I unfortunately got my post reported and got a 24 hour ban but it was worth it.
---
This is something that needs to be brought up more for and more open dynamic cause rn the game is just stale and needs some player vs player action.
---
same reply I typed for sly_1.
---
I‚Äôll wait to see how it is when it‚Äôs live. I can honestly say if I feel a large difference then I‚Äôll be leaving. I‚Äôve spent two years working my build and trading for my weapons and to have that all change would simply be unacceptable. 
---
I hope I‚Äôm wrong but this gives me bad vibes. Also notice how tse is seemingly the top dog now for some inexplicable reason. Does not seem to be the way it should be.
---
I will accept my downvotes now lol.
---
Thank you and you too, hopefully this will generate a more healthy conversation on the topic.
---
I think the files for it have been in the game since the beginning, I remember seeing data mined pictures of it.
---
Laggy servers have RNG issues. You'll also notice that the effects tend to be from a limited pool too. Really good if you're looking for specific effects, though.
---
Wow downvotes over a typo cause of big fingers. No wonder I don't ever bother coming to this sub.
---
I got a broadside and then identical missile launchers. I did get a mix of other stuff after that. But it was a disappointing first 3 rolls
---
My man üçªü§ôüçªü§ô

Oh, Whoopsies...

I‚Äôll take that penny if you don‚Äôt want it

Ohh yes!  15 minutes I‚Äôd been stood there then this level 18 appears out of the bushes... ‚Äú I‚Äôll save you‚Äù
---
Ohh thanks!
---
For a counterargument, I feel like Bethesda has made all the right choices when it comes to how they've handled pvp in 76. Basically, once they realized that the vast majority of their playerbase didn't want to go around killing each other and destroying camps, they all but removed the feature entirely. I see anti-pvp posts on here daily but pro-pvp? Maybe once, twice a week? And as well written out as yours? Almost never.
---
I understand that there are people out there who wanted this game to be absolutely brutal, to be able to just attack whoever they wanted, whenever they wanted. But the reality is that's a very small number of people. The popularity of games like Fortnite and PUBG as well as hardcore, team based survival games like DayZ definitely played a role in Bethesda's initial decision of a multiplayer based Fallout game with pvp. But it was the wrong decision and they've done a good job backing off that while making the game into the pve team based experience most people wanted from the get go.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again, yes, many of us have wanted and asked for a multiplayer Fallout game. But it wasn't because we wanted to kill each other. It was because we wanted to share the experience live with our friends, together.
---
Bethesda seriously needs to get on the ball and implement a dual server option, similar to what other MMORPGs use. There needs to be a hardcore survival server that features full pvp and there needs to be a more RP based server that has either very limited (akin to our current Adventure Mode) pvp or no pvp at all. I'll die on this hill. Get on it, Bethesda. Especially if you aren't gonna update Nuclear Winter, at least give the pvpers something.
---
It's anyone's guess right now. Until patch 22 hits on the 15th, there's so many different builds that will be affected. Bloodied are concerned with not being able to drop enemies fast enough when dealing with mobs, 
---
Personally I think sneak builds might move up slightly  in popularity, especially  with anti-armor weapons.
---
But, just give the 76 community a few days to try all the combinations of builds after the 15th and there's going to be 100's of 'looking for....' posts for the new meta build.
---
With about twice as many new effects, how about all those bow effects on ballistic guns? How about magical debuffs that make enemies drop more caps or chems?
---
Oh and leaks suggest a sten gun is getting added at some point soonish
---
Usually die to doxing but I usually take a photo and send to bethesda for stuff like that. Workshop ones are annoying.
---
Put your CSS on a quick button, that's the only solution, besides not dying.
---
No, I have realistic expectations from game developers. You have got a terrible attitude.
---
I respect your opinion and some of your ideas for more old school games modes I would also be interested in. But I think that because the game is unbalanced that's what brings some charm to it. Anyone can use the tools available to tip the scale in their favor whether it be numbers or map advantage. The open world part of it allows for a unique fight every time because its so chaotic.
---
As for those who don't want to PvP, I get that its not fair but I am not a normal build. Other then basic damage cards I'm all tank and do okay. But part of the fun I used to have was avoiding PvP like they are Jason Voorhees, if I get caught I'm screwed so I got better at laying low and avoiding it altogether at first.
---
But to each their own, I just felt the need to show that the scale has tipped to far in the balance of PvE vs PvP.
---
Yes!  I‚Äôm excited.  I actually enjoy the grind
---
Stop doing it so fast

Ah yes I most definitely did that *said whilst I sit on my quantum throne in my quantum mansion*
---
The scrip limit should be raised to 420. üòéü§ôüèæ
---
Happens to me all the time with my shotguns
---
I understand but at the same time I think it will be good, it will open doors up for more builds rather than the clich√© that is bloodied. As I said though I understand your concerns, I just don't see any real problem which ever way I look at it, regardless of all points being made. People were and are fixating on not being able to do damage, enough of it anyway... Now to me I see the tools to make different builds being implemented with this new patch. But this is simply my opinion from what I hear and see. I think it's good for the game on a whole, it will also bring a new meta which all online games need.
---
It's not that, it's more of people continously asking "what happened to the Weekly &amp; Daily Challenges?" Or "Did Season 1 end?" I've been seeing these posts all week long. Better to do some research ahead of time before jumping to asking questions.
---
" turtle's video also implies that TS is performing better than B in a bloodied build, meaning that bloodied weapons are now worthless. specially if you consider that TS doesn't really require a build or you to be at low health. "
---
That is unclear, as all of the tests in that video were done in angry Turtles own words "with nerd rage" meaning he was running a bloodied build at less than 20% health.  
---
So yeah, if ts outperforms bloodied at low health that is a long long long way from saying ts is now god tier because you "don't need a build".
---
You'd have to test ts at full health vs bloodied with nerd rage procced to actually give your claims any credence.
---
Try going into her BIOS and turning off Intel SpeedStep and Intel SpeedShift. Both of these have issues with Fallout 76.
---
If you are really concerned about ammo, just do what we all are going to do, prime your guns and get the ammo-perks.
---
Most definitely. Perfect timing with the new update imo, builds will change as pvp is now stale and to much of the same thing. üëç
---
I agree I don't want that brutal of PvP like the examples to mentioned. I liked the balance we had at first but I know that is gone for good. I would just be happy with private teams being able to group aggro for PvP like before and workshops to be buffed to promote them as PvP battlegrounds. The game can stay primarily PvE, just the back tracking on PvP went a bit to far for me personally.
---
Only works for frag grenade explosions
---
honestly you guys should always have radaway or diluted radaway as hotkey.  soon as you step out of that mine, drink one.  now it gives you time to react
---
I have spectrum internet and Wi-Fi.. 99% of the time, when I am being disconnected from a server, it is because of them. Spectrum equipment absolutely sucks.
---
I'm a casual, lone wandered too. I like to pay it forward in my vending machines. I sell all plans and recipes, regardless of what they are, for 11 caps (it's 11 because I hate that Bethesda takes their tax and I want a clear 10 caps - I know I'm crazy) and all ammo i sell for 1 cap, regardless.  
---
I do get annoyed when I see players selling plans for incredible amounts - you can't take that shit to the grave with you
---
There are no downsides to other builds though. You‚Äôre allowed to stay at full health so there is no cost for the benefit of outdamaging a bloodied build with a tse weapon. This, to me, defies logic and makes bloodied obsolete.
---
1. Anyone using a container near a commonly visited spot for character trades made an unwise decision. It‚Äôs generally accepted that those areas/containers are where we dump ‚Äòfreebie‚Äô stuff for other players. 
---
2. Crafting low level Fixers (level 20 is lowest IIRC) is a nice gesture. I‚Äôve done the same, and then converted it to .38 so there is a decent weapon available to use up all that ammo.
---
If you removed all magic weapons and all magic armor then I would be onboard.  The reason PvP is a dumpster fire is it‚Äôs more of a gear comitition then anything to do with skill.   The ‚Äúgood‚Äù PvP games have balance and equality.    Fallout has none of those things.    
---
You mentioned that you had a fun experience early in the game.   I believe you did.   That same experance today would not go the same way due to what I mentioned above.   You also mentioned a team or support aspect.    That is great for people who play in a group for us solos being ganged up on is not fun.    
---
The last thing is the biggest nail in the coffin.    The market has spoken.   There was a PvP mode.  It devolved to the same very small group of players.   They shut it down because it was not worth it.
---
If they released a mode with all legendarys removed and you had to choose you faction at the start and were locked into that I would give that a go for the reasons you mentioned.   It certainly could be fun.
---
And don't forget the most uncommon one (in my experience from looking at displays in camps), Clean Mr. Handy Fuel.
---
This is more what I meant. Or a Pvp automatically enabled for everyone zone. If you go in, you know you can attack or be attacked already. Fair for all players.
---
Steel, aluminum and lead are the 3 that drop weight. Rest increase weight or stay the same.
---
I got it in beta but I quit after a few months because it just never ran well. Always game breaking bugs and weird visual issues. Came back during the end of my quarantine period. Finished wastelanders around the time season 1 came out. So until recently when I finished the season I hadn't realized how much nothing there is to do. These last couple weeks have been dauntingly boring. Idk how anyone is level 300+. There just isn't that much fallout to play.
---
But hooray for season 2 being around the corner. I enjoy playing for sure. I just have nothing to do while I'm playing.
---
We just got a new workbench last week.
---
That's the gun I use to solo Apc. Hold on to it with your life. Mine is called Lucinda.
---
But then you have to re-equip armour. Imo the item bar isnt great on console when paired with lag. I have my CSS named so that it's at the top of my Apparel
---
Did you try the Light Footed Perk? It makes you immune to trap camps
---
She's... boring?  Not interesting.  Doesn't have enough dialogue just like all the other npcs
---
Yeah I've been crashing alot, crashed 3 times yesterday, its strange somtimes i can play for 4 plus hours and somtimes i crash within the first 10 mins, event viewer says its a heap corruption with ntdll.dll.
---
That was my thought, especially with the sale this weekend. Like, who's NOT hitting up the Rusty Pick? My anal retentiveness to hoard everything like it's going out of style brought me to check. 
---
Yes. 20 is the lowest and good call with the .38 conversion. I'll get some out there when I play later. Thanks for the reply!
---
I‚Äôve seen them at station vendors a lot, and some player vendors.
---
Define "tank" build.
---
as for melee 2h or unarmed has always been better than 1h and I suspect that will remain the case after 1 wasteland.
---
The nerf isn't consistent though, the larger the gap between the base damage and it's strongest receiver/damage increasing mods are then the more damage players will lose. So ballistic heavy guns come out really well, while many others are doing less damage than they should under the new system.
---
From playing the PTS I'm fine with the nerf but a lot of people will be disappointed with how badly it's been handled, without even getting into the inconsistency of damage perks
---
Bloodied, junkies, aa, vampire and quad I guess, and probably ffr on most shotguns is the logical choice if magic effects like limb dmg, bashing dmg and 33 vats weren't a thing in VATS. Most 3rd effects are pointless but faster reload is probably most useful or 25% less VATS cost if you use it, I'm still using a 2* B 33 gauss shotgun and don't see any need to get a 3*.
---
I'd say Vault 420 but let's be honest that was already in New Vegas
---
Point taken.
---
If I remember my numbers correctly, I‚Äôm 15 STR, 13 PER, 11 END, 3 CHR, 9 INT, 5 AGI, 4 LCK
---
Most of the STR points are given to the usual melee perks: Incisor3, martial artist3, barbarian.  Prior to SS armor, I was in PA a lot more often, so I gave one point  to one gun army for the heavies.  Couple of good rolls gave my SS armor +50 poison resistance and +25 RR on top of its base resistances.
---
Fireproof gets 1 for SB sonic attacks.  Ironclad gets 1.  
---
PER has tank killer3, and I gave stabilized 3 INT, nerd rage2, first aid and pharmacist 1 each.
---
healing factor takes care of any damage post fight, and the vampire weapons give back health per hit.  
---
Not indestructible, but it works without having to carry a boatload of stimpacks.  (I use way more diluted radaways than any other chem)
---
I think Deathclaws were considered kinda mythical in the first fallout like most people didn't believe they existed
---
Yes! I've tried to always do this (although for 10 caps) with plans. People need them and appreciate them (I'm a sucker for any plan/recipe). I leave my camp near the Wayward for that reason. 
---
There have been some plans I've paid a pretty penny for (Lever Action, for example), only because I couldn't find it organically. But, for the most part, if they're less than 50 and I don't know it, I'm buying that plan! 
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Fireproof. Max Rank.
---
I only have the one that i play with.  Seems it had to do with when I played while the atom shop wasn't available.  Never ran into that before and been playing since launch.
---
do not forget tank killer, some nice anti armor goes a long way against tougher enemies
---
And calling bloodied builds cliche is cute and all but it‚Äôs the single most well thought out build in the game utilizing a multitude of perks working in harmony to maximize damage. 
---
Making farm builds nearly as effective in damage output makes no sense.
---
Remove survival mode, set a cap to max damage, remove chipping damage before PvP, remove PvP at workshops, remove PvP from here and there...
---
How safe do you want the wasteland to be? Let workshops be a battle zone. You walked there, it's war.
---
Not saying commando without sneak isn‚Äôt viable cause it is. But on one of my toons I‚Äôve started using a bloodied power armour heavy gunner. The furthest thing from stealth I can get and with emergency protocols I‚Äôm tanky af. Just another option if you don‚Äôt want stealth I‚Äôve been having fun with it.
---
No, it wasn't supposed to come out now.
---
This. I‚Äôve been playing MMO‚Äôs since Everquest. Was rotting love with Elder Scrolls Online. Bought Fallout 76 the first time it went on sale on Xbox. Was still wrapped up in ESO. Wasteland came out and logged in to try it again. Haven‚Äôt logged back into Elder Scrolls Online since. The world just looks amazing.
---
Oh I agree that magic weapons and some of the imbalances damaged the interest in PvP for sure and I don't want a full time PvP mode. Really I'd be happy with just the team aggro for pvP returning for private teams not public.
---
As for solos being jumped, I have always been solo apart from my one friend who I still play with. I have been jumped but its a wasteland. Leveling up PvE monsters jumped me and killed me more so I don't see the difference in situations.
---
As a solo player your choosing to go alone so you must adapt to remain hidden as you will be seen as the prey. I used to hide my camp far on the corner of the map to avoid it being found by players for that reason as I was terrible at PvP then so I do get it. I just think PvE players take dyeing to another player way harder then they should when PvE characters do the same thing to us all the time leveling up.
---
Wrong floor
---
Don't make me call The House Un-American Activities Committee....
---
One of my older Characters was actually a heavy gunner. Level 70ish but no bloodied since it was played during the tse era. That character was a ton of fun
---
Tank killer is def nice.bloody mess would pair up really good as well
---
Tank Killer and an investment in VATS/Critical Hits goes a long way.
---
Also, Adrenaline.
---
I caught this in wendigo cave right after using some radaway
---
I didn't even know that was a perk card. Is it under strength
---
you know power armor with a heavy weapon
---
Autism single daddy here... you get all the feels. On PC or I‚Äôd help out how I can...
---
Treat every camp like it's a trap camp and then enjoy them when you finally find a good one. I love seeing how many different ways I can die at well thought out trap camps. If you're not carrying any junk on you then death has no real penalty in this game.
---
Ooh that would make sense because the emojis are directly tied to the atom shop (as evidence from swapping between accounts). Atom shop not available =no emotes. We scienced it.
---
Heavy gunner, pa, emergency protocols, dodgy, ricochet, vampire weapon... invincible.
---
Yeah ! They made it with the vendors
---
Great suggestion.  OR even some middle ground where any time 2 players not on a team are within workshop boundaries a pop up for all players announcing "you are in a disputed workshop!  pvp will commence in 10 seconds!"
---
and then a countdown starts.  This gives people time to tuck tail and run if that's their thing.
---
I think we need a second to appreciate how you spelled appreciate.
---
Server seed, time joined server seed and frequency hitting the loot table
---
Perception. same with most commando perks
---
It does yes I do one pick lock 2 PA and usually run in 7 minutes.
---
Is that under agility?
---
Yup. What a pain in the ass. You can skip all of that.
---
Exactly
---
&gt;You'd have to test ts at full health vs bloodied with nerd rage procced to actually give your claims any credence.
---
you mean one of them, because you ignored the rest. but even then, yeah, low health builds will always deal more damage than full health ones. but that doesn't change the fact it's absurd that an AA or TS weapon is comparable to a bloodied one in said low health build.
---
not to mention TS is infinitely more versatile than B. you can play at low or full health, with or without a build. and according to turtle's video, bloodied weapons are now only marginally stronger than regular ones. so you might as well just pick vampire's and become invincible, even at low health.
---
I don't see the outcome changing much even at full health, too. yeah, bloodied means more damage which means more armor is bypassed. and *that* means that the effects of this nerf will be even worse for junkie's builds, I mean, turtle said it himself: AA is outperforming it.
---
that makes no sense. there are several implications, side effects, to this nerf, and none for the better.
---
Looks like it happens when you kill them all 2 fast.
---
After they come out, let them walk for a bit before attacking
---
Bloodied Unyielding whatever is viable whatever you do, as long as perks and mutations are where they are supposed to be.
---
Thank you for this information I will most definitely look into these perks.. 45 to 50 dps it's cutting and only 4 to 8 dps on acp or sbq
---
Dataminers agree there's a seed based on server creation time and the time you join the server. Rolling legendary in rapid succession causes it to hitch even more.
---
It's never worked as intended.
---
Tank killer, concentrated fire, bloody mess, better crits, adrenaline, tenderizer, covert operative... and watch the heads pop like water balloons.
---
Salt free and fun pvp exists!
---
All that said I'd encourage everyone who actually likes pvp to try LOW LEVEL pvp.  up to lvl 40 or so the game is shockingly well balanced without god tier gear, legacies, etc.  Especially nowadays with VATS broken in pvp for the most part.
---
Gonna need you to add about 2 zeros on the end of that number there, then we've got a deal.
---
Now to have this set up how would I need my specials?
---
They did that on purpose, so you couldn't even get ALL the scrip so you have to come back EVEN MORE
---
Seems like it‚Äôs possible to steer while running screaming. Or it could just be coincidence .
---
Earle and Queenie both have Static Damage % Reduction, making it so even with anti armor they still take less damage then other enemies.
---
how has that changed from now though?  Like a vamp weapons make you more or less unkillable in pve, people tank iss with them today.  So if that persists post nerf, so what?
---
Adrenaline is under agility, yes, add bloody mess under luck for an extra 15%. Depending on the style commando you are (run and gun or sneak) add something like covert ops in agility and crit perks under luck.
---
Bethesda probably want us chasing that perfect gear, grinding till our minds are broken
---
ùÖ°ùÖ° 1 is the loneliest number that you ever do. ùÖ°ùÖ°
---
You can use this site to plan out your specials before moving points around
---
https://nukesdragons.com
---
That it'll be a good tank build, made more viable because it's doing more damage proportionally from 21 to 21 than bloodied.
---
Most people saying strangler heart is better got it through trade exploits before Bethesda patched it.    It can't be traded now which means no one can mod it for you. 
---
And T65 doesn't require Vault Steel.
---
There is way less headache in putting together a set of T65 and the damage resistance is better.
---
Ok. I choose not to initiate and keep my workshop and you can keep on shooting your gun fingers at me till they fall off.
---
So, since you're never coming back (they wont ever remove the limits unless it's a Fallout 1st thing) mind reinstalling just long enough to give me all your stuff?
---
I don't see how that changes the fact that you'll be wasting twice as much ammo, at the very least.
---
or that you'll be in constant need of flux.
---
I still feel like I can do better than 4 to 8 dps on them.. at that point I'm basically relying on the others to kill them and that's just not okay with me.
---
The Nuke Zone respawn is a PITA - you can't jump there but Beth can put you in time after time.
---
I have CSS on the selection wheel specifically for this reason and it helps that i have memorised my armour pieces for rapid refit. If yours isn't easily and quickly found you can  prefix each piece to sit concecutive on the list so you have to waste minimal time searching.
---
Personally i play as a PA Vampire's heavy gunner. nothing screams "Tank" like an immovable object. i plan on sinking 3 or 4 legendary perks into special stats to further boost my inability to be taken out (PVE standpoint)
---
If you aren't bloodied, this is my suggestion.
---
Take concentrated fire, commando perks, tank killer, Tormentor, bloody mess and an antiarmor silenced weapon. Covert ops and Sandman.
---
As a commando, you'll do great damage. Mutations: speed demon and eagle eyes.
---
Wait can you also skip the reactor repair or do you need to use the terminal for that?
---
please, next time try the search function first
---
Weapons degrade slower in daily ops so that's what you're seeing. Outside of daily ops I use my flamer for stealth, it might even be better than my rifles after the patch.
---
Choosing not to iniate doesn't mean attackers can't still initiate.
---
I‚Äôll share my build with you. Albeit a bloody build. But there‚Äôs cards in there you won‚Äôt necessarily need since you won‚Äôt be bloodied. Gimme a few to whip it up on nukes and dragons and I‚Äôll share the link.  In the meantime my rifles are built as such:
---
Powerful auto receiver, aligned long barrel, precise stock, Swift mag, reflex sight, suppressor
---
I appreciate it my guy.
---
I live this idea, I also love the idea of making caps a 1500 limit so I can just sell 3 serums and be done
---
Then they will still just sneak up easier then before from any angle and snipe you before any prompt would pop on your screen.
---
Best perk is an armor piece with take 15% less damage while blocking. You‚Äôll see why
---
I don't dispute any of this, but I think you are blowing it out of proportion.
---
I suspect whatever is 2nd best, maybe its ts or tse, maybe something else.  But whatever it is, it will be a lot closer to bloodied than now. 
---
We've known this all along.  the changes will bring the gap between builds closer together so there's no longer this massive gulf between bloodied and all else. 
---
Other builds become stronger in relative terms.  That is the entire reason for the nerf in the first place: changing the damage bonuses to be additive makes damage output more linear and predictable for the devs to balance around.
---
As for none of this being good, I suppose it all depends on what you want out of the game.  Personally having played on the pts I find my characters are still effective and I can still enjoy the game.  So for me, I'm not in the "sky  is falling" camp.  
---
Yes my bloodied characters will require some reworking to get them to a state I'll enjoy playing but legendary perks will easily get me to that point without having to make any actual sacrifices.
---
I  wasn't expecting it in patch 22.  I have given up on expectations for this game. I never expect  anything in any patch.  When it drops, I take a look and see what's there.
---
The inside the vault article mentioned daily ops and one wasteland, so that's all you're getting most likely.  I didn't see the legendary perk system mentioned, so I assume that's not coming in the patch. Or if it does, it will be like Colossal Problem: it will drop with the patch, but it won't drop with the patch (meaning you won't be able to use it Tuesday when the patch drops).
---
This thing has been in my vendor  for weeks and no one's ever bought it.  I know someone is out there though, so it  stays until someone who can love it stumbles across my little shop.
---
So I absolutely LOVE the gauss shotgun and the build I have for it.  It‚Äôs prob my favorite of all the builds I‚Äôve made.  The perks are one part of it....but getting the best mods on the gun and rolling a good legendary are key too.  The best combo I have had run like this(and remember the baseline damage with no mods or perks is 105 for lvl 50)
---
-Roll the shotgun until you get an unyielding 2 or 3 star.  It will work like whoa with the VATS perks. 
---
-Add the vicious receiver....makes your crit hits insanely high.
---
-Add the extended barrel.  It will give your shotgun range like a rifle.
---
-Add the forceful stock.  It almost doubles the durability.
---
-Add the perforating magazine.  Adds armor damage.
---
-Add the short scope. 
---
The shotgun will function like a rifle with all these mods.
---
As far as perks, obviously max out all the shotgunner and skeet cards, but also max out your VATS and bloody mess cards.  You get limb damage bonus and +15% just from those two.  
---
With this build, my baseline damage is 475 per shot and it almost triples on critical VATS shots.  
---
Hope this helps.  Got any questions, lemme know
---
I'm a clich√©, bloodied is because it's the norm and to go to. There are even numerous perks that work in favor of bloodied but non that do high health in terms of damage, resistance to a point aswell. There will always be a difference between a farm build and a high damage build regardless. Otherwise all builds would be obsolete, there would be zero point to making a build with that logic.
---
I like it and it works fine. Sure, it should be able to get relocated more easily, but it is decent enough.
---
Run and gun. Sneaking isn't as fun to me.
---
Yeah!  
---
It seems that they even made mags for the Mauser C96 that had up to 40 rounds in them! The trench carbine versions even had a longer barrel.
---
So many options man! The pistol was simply amazing piece of engineering.
---
Thank you! Just let me know. :)
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7f3459d&amp;d=sf2sg2s60p02pg2ph2pp2pi2e30eu0cu2ce0i11ir2ar2an1a03la2l71lt2lv1lu2
---
Yeah it looks like outside of your desired weapon perks and demo expert that‚Äôs really all you‚Äôll need to maximize damage output.
---
gotcha, I mean there's no reason you can't be both.  PA with heavy guns will be mostly str, so you can also have melee perks to swap over to when you want to change up your playstyle.
---
I have a pa heavy gunner that can change on the fly to shotguns or melee and it's fun having 3 builds in 1.
---
"Variety is the spice of life" and all that.
---
All that said a heavy gunner pa build will be the easiest to get going post nerf as it relies on the least gear (pa is easy to acquire) and the easiest to play.  The only hard bit is ammo but with daily ops and/or legendary ammo crafting perk it won't be a big deal moving forward.
---
There's some replayability in the game, like trying different builds or doing the vault raid with raiders vs settlers, but there's no real consequence to any of it. You miss out on one of the factions' end outfits and potentially the slug buster, that's about it. You can still reach max rep even with the faction you "betrayed". And it seems like bethesda is letting you buy important stuff like the ammo converter, chinese stealth suit, etc with gold bullion if you miss it from playing
---
Actually, the biggest missable thing I can think of is the unique PA helmet skin from the fun and games quest. If you're mean to ra ra and don't try a PA/photomode clip into the room, I think your character is permanently locked out of it. Can't buy it anywhere and can't trade for it afaik
---
The world existing in it feel smaller. Fewer people interacting with camps, etc and instead just traveling to their mega camps off map
---
Ohh is that what that is? I actually found another Interloper in The Deep
---
Is limb damage any good on shotguns?I know it has a magic effect but it will probably get patched.But the enforcer perk card makes up for the limb damage right?
---
I have a mutants,quad,suppressed vampires,gauss and regular all exploding and I use them for different events or enemy‚Äôs all 3 shotgun perks enforcer and scattered all of my shotguns are 3* and I‚Äôve never rolled a bloody one and it‚Äôs funny because I roll bloody weapons or pick them up from legendarys all the time and I‚Äôm not a bloody build I gave a 3* bloody mini gun with exploding bullets to my friend who‚Äôs a bloody build he‚Äôs helped me a lot and given me awesome weapons also it‚Äôs good to have help in this game
---
He must be the only one. I personally know 3 other people with the bunker and all our stuff is floating.
---
You can skip that too. I power armor glitch through the two grids at the very start. No need to get the card and scan. Then down the hall to the end and past those two gutsys on the right Once in the next room reactor stay left. I pick lock level 3 the first door on the left. Then second room on right you PA glitch through the door no need for terminal. and PA glitch again right in front of you and your in silo. Sounds more complicated then it is.
---
I still feel like pistols and explosive are getting thrown under the bus again. That would completely kill my favorite characters.
---
If you build around it, a bow can be a BEAST. I have a bloodied + limb damage compound bow which oneshoots most enemies and hits Earl for over 250 with each shot.
---
I can clean all rooms with it. Silent as fuck. 
---
It's definitely a VATS weapon, and you can use it to freeze bosses or to tag everyone with Explosive Arrows.
---
Bows are heavy hitters. I am getting 3k of damage with mine.
---
Then thats not called initiate. You want a warning count down then at "Go!" It's a free for all. If not then the first shots will always be kill shots from most of the Meta builds I know.
---
And since you won‚Äôt be bloodied you can tweak some with and still be super effective. If you have a faster fire/less vats cost rifle with your gun setup like that you can almost hit infinite vats shots and your crit meter will basically recharge every third bullet. I know that‚Äôs entirely accurate and I‚Äôm not claiming to be an expert, so if anyone else chimes in with alternate or better info, it‚Äôs always welcome.
---
I'm expecting Steel  Dawn in  January 2021 and Fractured Steel in maybe May or June 2021.     That's just a rough estimate based on what happened in a previous road map with Wastelanders. In the road map they said Wastelanders would be coming out in Fallout 2019. It got delayed to April 2020. And back then there was no COVID.
---
Back when there was no COVID, Fall 2019 meant April 2021.  With COVID,  the delay this time can only be worse.
---
Karma in the original fallouts barely meant anything, and I think you could farm it by killing slavers in random encounters. The most it did was give you a few new dialogue choices, and potentially a few smaller quests were locked behind a karma gate or had additional choices at certain levels. You had bounty hunters sent after you as a childkiller, but that is technically not related to karma, although it's pretty closely tied with a negative karma run. FNV really had the biggest impact from reputation, and that was very easily exploitable. All the big factions had a character to whom you can just turn in random stuff to get to idolized immediately
---
The legacy ones cause the issue , it‚Äôs really what his problem is. That‚Äôs why people think ‚Äú my Tesla‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt do this ‚Äú justifies the hate and down votes really it‚Äôs just legacy explosive Tesla‚Äôs that are the problem they make radiation rumble and earl complete shit shows
---
You can mitigate this by targeting the nuke as far to the south and east* such that it only just grazes fissure prime....you still fight at v9 it‚Äôs just that the nuke zone is so far south that you very very rarely respawn in it.
---
(*)It doesn‚Äôt work as well going to the west instead. You can target as above to just graze the grove to the south of v9 as well to get a chance of a colossus
---
Spawn as well
---
Oh really? So the Colossal performance really is the normal performance? Damn, that's brutal. 1 reload breaks the gun...
---
One thing I haven't seen mentioned, are you sneaking? Running the sneak card while crouching with suppressed guns and covert operative really helps
---
Be flamer here...its probably the most powerful weap. I've used.
---
Even with the constant repair, it just disintegrates anything I point it at. And the range is amazing given the ballistic payload (due to explosive).
---
Dude I gotta try this lol. Only never ran it much because of the exasperating objectives
---
I think you've been away for too long üòÖ welcome back!
---
The issue is legacy explosive Tesla‚Äôs not all Tesla‚Äôs , it‚Äôs where the disconnect in this discussion starts ‚Äúnot my Tesla‚Äù is not a good response but neither is ‚Äúall Tesla‚Äôs are trash‚Äù
---
Lighting changed with wastelanders.
---
I‚Äôve snatched up a few things. I haven‚Äôt noticed issues with anything, only item up that I can think of as broken is the bunker. Can you tell me all broken atom shop items I must be missing so I can keep missing them?
---
I use an Xbox controller on pc. When I‚Äôm in vats the d-pad left and right will switch targets. Not sure what keyboard key does the same, but you can switch targets. Try the arrow keys maybe. The

Run and gun.
---
Huh I know one dude I played with had a basic ts tesla no explosive lagged the hell out of rad rumble
---
I rarely see these "God tier" players people on this sub talk about. ("hacked items, pvp items, that spam aid) Most more like me, average players. A lot of them are clueless and don't even seem to know Pvp is work shops. Sneaking up isn't necessary, out of curiosity I've went to workshops and killed players 100+ levels higher than me, using the same "strategy" I wrote in the OP. They don't even seem to know Pvp is a thing.
---
for that raider/slaver feel, they could be slaves armed with nothing but bomb collars on their necks and their usual scavenger rags. you could even hit them with the butt of your gun to make them cower like the vermin they are.
---
for a less "evil" aesthetic we could "hire" a settler to go scavenging for us
---
Edit: either people really dislike the cannon of slaves in fallout, or no one wants to have a paid employee at their camps.

---
Bringing back the cap explosion perk would be cool.
---
Yeah, I don't like using legacies and "magic" guns since they're so clearly broken from intended gameplay. I've got a few magic ones I've found(don't use), but no Explosive Energies (I never found any, and I won't buy them).
---
TSE is apparently out-damaging everything else by a huge margin. hopefully it's just an oversight, but still.
---
more to the point, TS is not 'closer', it's literally out-damaging B in its own game. 'closer' also does not mean that AA should outperform junkie's with 0 drawback, or that a vampire's weapon at 19% hp should have about the same damage as a bloodied one (only ~10% less if turtle's testing is to be believed).
---
other builds are just as weak, weaker actually. we're all getting F'd over. but my point is that now there's no reason to be bloodied/use bloodied weapons.
---
Or your ally could be a vendor
---
That‚Äôs very odd. Seems weird that they wouldn‚Äôt allow that on PC when they allow that on Consoles. 
---
Does that mean that you can use the Quick Stimpak option and Weapon Switch option while in VATS on PC?
---
I‚Äôm having difficulty with this.  In the CAMP menu the item has a circle with a line through it.  It shows that I have all the required components in order to build it and I obviously purchased it through the Atomic Shop.  I was able to place the rustic water mill in water no problem, but having difficulty with the generator variety.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Thank you!
---
If you're gonna be a little bitch and cheat in a game that's piss easy anyway, just go dupe a few million rounds and be done with it instead of shitting up the servers for the rest of us
---
I hate when this happens. Try fast traveling again after you arrive if you're in a bad spot - it almost always puts me at their actual camp the second time, for whatever reason.
---
I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs just the same keys that are bound to the Quick-Heal and Quick-Swap functions.
---
Sorry to burst you bubble, but I hear that there is planned to be a limit on the number of special focused legendary perks that can be equipped at any one time. It‚Äôs currently one but could increase to 2 or 3 maybe if lucky
---
Starlet Sniper is in the store for today only
---
So much this. I hate hauling a fatman around just cause I reached my limit! My stash might be filled with stims.
---
If the exploding weapons are week I‚Äôm all set playing all of my favorite weapons explode I‚Äôm a lover of all shotguns I‚Äôm almost level 300 and put way to much time into this game and money to try and change what I like or my style it‚Äôs really messed up because I really like this game but I won‚Äôt want to play if my guns are trash now
---
I dont think it does. Im not notecing any difference from when i was high health.
---
Yes, that's how the term is used in the game. Taking a work shop "initiates" pvp.
---
You can, yes.  It's the Z key by default.
---
My brother used this method and it worked for him too
---
Difference is that beth. Leaves them in game like a rare old vinyl record. It's not hacked or magic which I too wont use.
---
I found a way to the one that's caused this ire today, but I'll deffo try that tip next time I end up in a similar situation (it happens often, so I should be able to test this soon). Cheers bud.
---
of course you can, it's Z, not sure if thats standard
---
I don't do pvp but really don't have any issues with people wanting it back in the game.  If you play in pacifist you really have no worries.  The one question I would ask is how would you deal with player vending?  The reason I ask is it shows everyone where your camp is.   
---
 Player vending has become a huge part of the game and I personally would not want my self or customers being picked off while shopping ( i know just play in pacifist mode).  Nor would I like my camp or some one else's camp obliterated while shopping.  I get the roll play aspect but at the end of the day the only thing you can get off a dead player is some junk.  I do agree with the sentiment of what you wrote, and it was very well articulated.  Nice job.  One last question did you play in the survival server a lot?  I think it's a shame they replaced that with NW without actually trying to entice people like me to try it out.  I would have loved to be a neutral  player and set up shop and provide customers with Intel, meds, ammo, etc.
---
It is not harder, you just use more ammo.
---
Or maybe a Guitar Case Heavy Gun? It could be swapped between a .50 cal and a Grenade Launcher. Just imagine the builds!
---
- Critical Hit Meter recharge rate. 
---
- Value of loot found
---
- Durability and starting condition of looted gear.

Was he on PS4?
---
FYI : Fractured Steel will be separated with several updates/Patches not one big update, deadline for Fractured Steel is march 2021 after that we can expect a delay since ‚Äúwinter ‚Äú begins at mid-December Until March
---
Everything will be more clear within the next few weeks
---
Nope.  Only thing Luck itself does is affect how much crit charge you get per hit, and the condition of weapons/armor you loot.
---
It's annoying, but the game tends to spawn the player before the foundations of a camp if you're loading the area for the first time from a fast travel. What this means is you will fall through the foundations instead of staying above them for cliff bases, but the second fast travel will position you fine.
---
TSE returns to reign once more.
---
My gunslinger says yes, please!!!
---
Or even a automatic Crossbow, like in that Van Helsing movie.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted. We can‚Äôt build high enough for an elevator to make any sort of sense right now.
---
What was the badass pistol from fallout 4 looked like a Walther PPK Handgun like James Bond would use
---
No, I don't think they want a fight at all, because Nuclear Winter is there just waiting for that.  They just want to make someone else's life a little less pleasant -- probably to make themselves feel better about their own pathetic existence.
---
If you really need a decent weapon roll focus on trying 2-star. Other than that it‚Äôs just dumb luck and throwing yourself at it as much as you can stand to. I have more luck from drops and rewards tbh
---
Yep
---
It could all be avoided if they would just learn to set the spawn point by moving the CAMP module.
---
Is a good idea usually to not move around till you're sure that the camp has finished loading in.
---
Otherwise you'll get stuck in the foundation or could fall off a cliff even tho they designed it to avoid that very thing.
---
Good for you, next session starts soon, and I figured out last time I don't need subscription to do the legendary run, so a lot of free stuff next two months:)
---
no
---
Nope, bubble not burst. the legendary special stat cards at max rank allow you to dedicate 5 extra points to one special. but they cannot exceed 15 for perk card slots. i currently plan on P.E.A. Perception to increase blast radius of explosives (for crowd control as well as more splash for my VE weapons, as well as glow sight for those glowy boys. Agility for more AP refresh and Dodgy since dodgy works in power armor. and Endurance to boost my max HP farther to allow my vampire's stuff to have more space to regenerate. i tested the adjustments on the PTS and for a Special stat perspective i am confident in my plan
---
Y
---
I've definitely found myself stuck in the foundation one more than one occasion :)
---
Players or Bethesda?
---
Edit: is there some sort of spawn rule related to the location of the module?
---
I would not be butt hurt if another player killed me if the environment was equal.   I know I am a middle of the road player.   Better then some worse then others.   
---
If you took the mechanics of any of the previous fallout games and made them MMO. Then I would be fine.   
---
Make roles clearly defined.   Dweller or raider or ...   and like any other fallout game,  I see a lone or group of enemy‚Äôs I can choose to flee or engage.  Like I said,  I think it could be fun.    
---
Fallout 76 would require way to much work to be a reality.   And frankly most people like it the way it is.
---
No stop begging
---
L
---
In one NV run I wanted to finish with the Legion and an evil karma. Because you gain positive karma for every ghoul and raider you kill, and rarely lose for murder or plot choices, I resorted to mass thievery. I‚Äôd kill every NCR soldier in a camp and then pick up every bottle and can strewn on the ground and marked as owned. Then I‚Äôd dump it in the nearest trash can. I became evil by housekeeping.
---
Why avoid any camp around Seneca rocks.
---
From what I read you can get up to 6 points to spend for legendary perk cards. Each point of these 4 rank perk cards will cost 100 normal perk points. This will def. Give an advantage to veteran players.
---
Ah, I see your error. 
---
You meant to say that you could rank up one legendary perk card whereas you actually said you would invest in 3-4 legendary special related perks which is somethings you can‚Äôt do
---
I would not be opposed to 2 new pvp focused daily ops that run along with the pve one, one where everyone starts with the same gear and is free for all and one that is 3 v 3 where each member randomly spawns with a unique load out.   
---
I would also enjoy the removal of all open world pvp as well as changing workshop locations into mini horde mode events with resources that allow every one to use them. As it is now you really never see a well made workshop and it feels like a missed opportunity.
---
Yes yesterday I got 3 ultracite pistols. I‚Äôm a junkie auto rifle build and have no use for them. Almost like the 2 rolling pins I got from Uranium Fever.
---
Yes!!! A 1911 would be amazing, but it shoots .45, like a real 1911, and it‚Äôs more powerful than the 10mm or the revolvers.
---
Tanagra town, you say?
---
Bought a month of it recently, and spent that month hoovering up huge amounts of junk to build a surplus. With the amount I play the game these days, that surplus will easily last me into the foreseeable future.
---
value of loot which is good endgame
---
It‚Äôs definitely not, look at the Market Sub.
---
Might sound odd, but I think a 10mm bolt action conversion would be neat.
---
Why would I sell it?
---
I like it.
---
I actually shot her in the face once :)
---
True.....but that‚Äôs not what the guy said (looks like he meant something else though). Yes you have up to 6 legendary card slots, but currently only one of those can be SPECIAL related, so you could rank one special up by 5, not 2 or 3 different ones at the same time without redistributing special points as well. There is talk that this might increase though....we shall see
---
Half-life crossbow!
---
They really need to adjust the CAMP device functionality to allow us to rotate it and adjust the direction people spawn in at.
---
Only spawning north of it causes me so many troubles and budget on what otherwise would have been a perfect camp location. 
---
Let me rotate that direction south so people spawn safely at my front door.  .o  ,
---
That or bring in welcome mat functionality.
---
This time, for me, it was a camp just east of Central Mountain Lookout (which is east of Top of The World)
---
Yes. So it's fair. If anyone gets the first shot free then it's not. It is the way it is for a reason. If I own the workshop and I AND all my turrets get first shot on you then you're never taking my workshop.
---
We don‚Äôt have official info about Bomb event , all we have is speculation about it ‚Äú Auto launch nukes ‚Äú let‚Äôs hope next week we get Fall Roadmap or Trailer fall content to see what happen with this event
---
Most iconic handgun of all time? Yes please. Not to mention fits the lore great for retro futuristic.
---
Okay, I'll pass this on to the team
---
Worked for me when I ran the sample FIRST.
---
THEN put the fuse in to complete quest.
---
There REALLY needs to be some attention here. I don't care if it was slow as hell, but even just having it auto-retry in the background would be something at least.
---
Only the shot that doesn't hit is wasted. :)
---
While you might need twice the amount of ammo, you get much more now from the legendary ammo-perk, and even more still when you craft ultracite ammo. 
---
As for the flux need... so what? On hit on hemlock holes will net you about 500 violet flux, other places bring the same for other flux. Stabilizing agents? Nuke WS, a run there can bring you around 50 of those. Enough to get 50 stable flux, which in turn will translate to 25K of 5mm. (equip ammosmith and super duper to up that number!)
---
With that I fail to see where ammo could be any problem at all.
---
Let us have Athena for an ally and Sophia as a vendor!  ^  o^
---
It's most useful on shotguns but not that good unless you find it satisfying torturing enemies before just killing them. Enforcer is still good itself to use even without limb damage but if you want to cripple constantly you probably need both.
---
I feel like a spawn mat would be ideal - let me out people right by my front door, near my vendors.
---
I guess some people could abuse it by setting it over a cliff edge or something, but I'm sure Devs could remedy that.
---
Hardly rare with how duped they are.
---
I get that, but I would actually spend more time chasing gear if I could actually fucking scrap it. I also see the argument that having a limit forces people to hold onto gear, thereby taking up stash space leading to frustration and funnelling people towards fallout first‚Ä¶ But for those that have fallout first, where the scrap limit is removed, I think a limit makes no sense...
---
Portable power is useless and if you want to have high charisma, level it up to 9 so that you can share a 3\* perk card.
---
Yes.
---
I agree. Unless you have a broken piece or eat food.
---
Speaking of. How do we eat in the power armor....
---
The market sub and discord is full of the same duped items. It took me 3 weeks to get rid of a B2515 50 cal.
---
I'd tolerate the griefing to get that survival mode feeling back. Wasn't a great implementation but the wasteland felt different when other dwellers could potentially be a threat.
---
Cool, thanks, I'll try it out. I know the damage numbers are all over the place outside of vats, but haven't used vats with it yet.
---
How about no, give us ammo sub types and the rest of the fallout weaponry.
---
It was a Walther PPK. It was called the Deliverer.
---
It probably wouldn't hurt armor users too much if they decreased the rate of hunger to keep the well-fed buffs active longer. Between the 50% you get from there, it's easy enough to just pop an anti-biotics for 100% resist. Only problem occurs in nuke zones where I think the best resist you can manage is 90% with food and alcohol.
---
Take your pick Bethesda! We‚Äôve all offered solutions for ages, it‚Äôs time to listen and implement change!
---
- Remove the scrip limit
---
- Lower the max scrip cool down (I.E 12 hours)
---
- Remove bizarre scrip values (I.E 9/24)
---
- Allow scripping for leftover scrip value at a loss to the player
---
- Allow scrapping of legendary items (chance of legendary modules?)
---
- Or change scrip system to mimic gold bullion (I.E scrip for tickets of some kind)
---
Every good weapon was duped.
---
This doesn't change the effectiveness of these weapons. Ppl still trade valuable items for them.
---
yep. though i am still debating on if i also wanna boost luck, and move some points around more to increase agility and charisma so i can have both suppressor AND lone wanderer when playing alone
---
I'm sure the game would decide to just leave them on an edge or the floor below if that's the case.
---
If trap camps are an issue just set it up so that it cant be directly next to trap devices or trigger points.
---
Right? Same. You can watch some YouTube vids on it. Or I can show you sometime. Psn is delsquest
---
Yeah. This. Is so bored of putting all of my junk legendaries on sale / selling them to vendors because I have about four weeks worth of scrip stored and I‚Äôm running out of stash space.
---
He didn't say Steel Dawn was coming in Fall.   He mentioned "patches in the Fall with the Brotherhood of Steel."  The stuff in patch 22 qualifies as Brotherhood of Steel content, technically- *but it isn't steel dawn*. With Bethesda, you really have to pay very close attention not to what they say,  but  to ***what they don't say.***  What they don't say  is a greater indicator of what is or is not coming.
---
Not once did he say "Steel Dawn" when talking about the Fall.  If he didn't say it, then it's  probably not coming in the Fall.
---
It's annoying haha.
---
This is a fucking awesome idea
---
Ha hell man that is crazy it really was, yes that thing was my baby and looked beast with silencer ahh I miss it :(
---
If you record yourself dancing backpack kid dance i ll donate some pipe weapons and some nocturnal pipe 5star
---
Not bad, how about a heavy ballista?
---
I see people wanting B .50 caps all the time with no responses so demand is definitely there. Same for Vamps 2515, etc.
---
First months you were playing people werent using legendaries and other shit rn If someone with full asassin sent armor attack you you will never able to win . In fo76 pvp is just invisible people with their assasin sent set using quad tesla while drinking their 1000 nuka cola quantum trying to kill each other Because most of the people dont like pvp they wont add pvp stuff and bethesda trying to make majority of people not every people
---
After the way they "added" the service rifle as a skin for the handmade I would 100% expect that to happen with the 1911
---
Like almost all German made weapons. We kinda just are good at building these.
---
God yes. That's the sort of thing that makes me so frustrated about the game. There's a whole perk set dedicated to auto pistols and there's not even any weapons for them! Like, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they did that, what's the point?
---
Glad you posted this and hope it gets visibility. I enjoy camp building, but it's hard to destroy a camp after putting hours into it. Would love to be able to save them and choose which I want to use. I know the blueprinting system is suppose to do this, but we all know how well that works. This would be very profitable for Beth also, people would buy more camp stuff from the shop if they had 5 camps to build with. Plus having prebuilt holiday and community event camps.
---
Edit to add: I almost think it would have to be in the atom shop somehow so we could choose which camp similar to how we choose loot bags. Maybe have it as a progression reward. 1 co for every 100 levels up to like 3-500. 3 camps would be great. 5 would be amazing.
---
Hold on man! We have to wait for the "You knew what you were getting yourself into" weenies around here to justify being obnoxious because its an "intended game mechanic"
---
Yes, well see, but I wouldn't be surprised if one could have a rank 4 perception card and a rank 2 strength card...just guessing until beth puts it in the notes.
---
Hello from the other side:
---
I am an Xbox dude. Either way thanks for the tips dude I‚Äôm glad you hit me up!
---
Legacy Flamer and Cryolator are bugged. Every energy explosive projejct is counted as wearing usage and that is not happening for ballistic explosive hits.
---
They are really too overpowered during daytime farming, but I'll have no hesitation in burning down some naughty guys preferring raider demolition.
---
I think always North of the camp device is the spawn point?
---
Yeah, tents can be replaced easily, unlike camps.

I‚Äôm having the same problem in PS4. It‚Äôs been maybe two months and I can‚Äôt seem to fix it. Super frustrating because I‚Äôd love to advance through the storyline but every time I go back the terminal says it doesn‚Äôt recognize the sample. :(
---
Well it would explain the 10% loss
---
Yes there is two of them now. I want to know if we can actually visit the place they are coming from. This and the human face statues scattered about Watoga may all be connected
---
Since they've added an MG42 I think an allies side LMG would be lovely, Like a Bren gun or PPSh or something. I also think artillery needs a massive overhaul, it's ***ARTILLERY***, not explosive home defense, if my camp is somehow in the heart of watoga, I should be able to hit camp venture, maybe a bit closer like firebase hancock.
---
No. See linked comment below.
---
Not to speak of other bodily functions ü§Æ
---
Interesting, the mob specific gear is really tough to find compared to vanguards. I think the popular consensus is that it's trash so everybody scrips it. According to FED76, hunters/strength/better sneak heavy combat armor is 1k, while vanguards is 10k.
---
I too hope that they let us apply more than one special related legendary card.....
---
I‚Äôd like more points in agility most so It‚Äôs maxed out to 15 (from 3). With just one perk card maxed I could redistribute those 3 to somewhere else like strength, endurance, charisma. One point in each would be good in any case as I could add barbarian for tankiness and radicool to improve that, and then add another point in suppressor as you say....and also max out adrenaline in agility.
---
I would like to be able to effectively add in another 10+ normal perk cards though....the things I could do with that....I can see how OP that could get though
---
Fine
---
Yeah, same experience (somtimes). I do wonder about rng though. Played about 2k hours and dropped about 4 handmades while rolling pins drop like dead flies. Not much diff with perv.
---
A second or fourth teleport usually gets me in the right spot. The worse I've seen happened yesterday. I kept spawning between a resource extractor and some stairs. I couldn't get out and the game refused to put me anywhere else, so I said fudge that vendor and left.
---
Just swap out the rifleman perks for command perks and then tweak to how you like it.

---
Because, in the famous words of Todd Howard, "It just works!"
---
... As it should be. Building up a work shop takes time and resources. If there's a load of turrets they should be able to attack someone coming to you. As it is they walk past all your defenses even though you both know they are there to attack you.
---
Quite honestly, not only should the 1911 be in game, but if we got an MG42 in game, we should have a Browning M1919A1 machine gun.  The game should also have a legitimate Browning Automatic Rifle instead of the Combat Rifle. Or replace the Assault Rifle with a Vietnam era M16. Rename pipe guns into handmade guns, add the handmade shotgun, add the .44 bull barrel. Or add weapons from previous fallout games, just with updated textures like the 10mm SMG.
---
Z and C, says so in the bottom of the screen when you are targetting an enemy in vats.
---
I have tested and spawned into the nuke zone and if I just wait I end in a rad death nuke zone spawn infinite loop, fun times.
---
Maybe you can have a camp and a off map settlement
---
Great idea, always wanted to build another camp with all my learned plans but cannot let go of my current one.
---
I also would like new weapons but then we have an issue them being  there just for the sake of being there. If this was weakass weapon, would OP still use it?
---
We can only hope.....Fingers crossed

Super helpful as I see I'll need 12p and 8l to run what i think will get me decent dps

Just gotta pay attention, bruv.

You are saying because it works for you, it works for everyone.  Way too many times, my event team arent doing any events and literally 3 times in a row, me and 2 others stood in a different instance and both left because of that.

The stealth is bugged as fuck. I have chinese stealth armor, 20 agility and all the perks, yet I am in danger while not even attacking. I got from hidden to dangwr while no mob around in the mole miner event. 
---
It is maybe 200 post out here about how bad stealth is, and even the developers are saying they will look into it. So just because it works for you, doesnt mean it works for everyone. Its the worse attitude to have, this center of the universe attitude. Good for you it works for you, we dont know why it doesnt work for us other. Maybe chinese armor bug. Maybe perks bugs as they rank up, which they do! Latest yesterday a youtuber have video about bugged perks as they rank up.

Anytime!

November still Fall , December is winter
---
Yeah he is messed up with BoS content overall, we don‚Äôt know which BoS he meant Steel dawn or fractured steel
---
Yeah my camp does this and I have no idea why. I've moved the camp module several times now and it still spawns me or anyone visiting my camp at the bottom of the cliff.
---
Luckily there is a path leading up to it otherwise it would be alot more annoying

Analyze the blood first then install the fuse.  If that doesn't work log off and back in and do again

I'm on Xbox and not only had it been crashy, I've had to unplug the console and restart it in order to get the game to load properly.

Yeah, counted my points in regular perks to max out my legendary cards. I've got to think hard on what I really want tho...given the cost to switch!
---
Not even the ash piles, nor the meat piles, after everything Is cleaned up the area where it all laid still breaks the fps. Only thing that helps is fast traveling away and back. A really weird bug.
---
Bug is my guess. I had one close enough to mine that I went for a gander, all the vendors were operational and the CAMP seemed legit. Just greyed out and couldn't fasttravel.
---
*Critical Savvy* if you are using unyielding set and have high LCK. Especially so if you can reach the 34 LCK breakpoint (for critting every other shot = 50% critical refill rate per shot)
---
If you are not using unyielding and have low LCK, i would imagine *Four Leaf Clover* would be better.
---
Definitely not *Better Criticals*.

I‚Äôm going to assume that your perk cards and weapon choices/armour perks  along the way just aren‚Äôt set up right. 
---
If you want you can add me on smithy_bmx and I can give you some tips and advice on where to get stuff you‚Äôll need or on any build that you might want.

---
made a few adjustments on the points that seemed either wasted, or could be better used IMO.
---
What about daily ops or is that apart of one wasteland?
---
I want to ban those who use hacked weapons for example,   Literally just use common sense.  Yes if its bethesdas fault and more like an innocent glitch than an exploit, yes of course dont bermaban that. Common sense my friend.  Thats all im asking.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the trap camp community would abuse the spawn mat somehow
---
So what?  The road map said Steel Dawn is coming in the Fall. But Jeff didn't say it was coming in Fall. If he  didn't say it was coming in  Fall, then it most likely isn't.
---
I never had issues with the bunker however the blood eagle hut thing was a pain everything went through the floor, had to place the item I wanted them pick it up and position it to get it to sit on the floor of the hut
---
Yup, it‚Äôs still coming with Patch 22
---
I would generally agree that of these, Better Criticals is less important.  Any critical is worth more than an ordinary shot, so the more of those you can do, the better.  You're right that in a Bloodied build, Luck alone might make Four Leaf Clover *and* Critical Savvy somewhat overkill.
---
It depends though.  I mean, I hear the critical sound effect go off all the time as I have Spacebar held down, but unless I'm burst firing, I don't really see the critical damage reflected in the damage numbers.  I don't know if they are just wrong, or if it's possible to simply outpace the game's ability to process it.
---
If you move around the camp device to different locations in the green circle it will change your spawn point, i did that until I found a spawn point that I like üëçüèº
---
I have consistently spawned north of my module. It might be NE or Nw but it's always been north of it.
---
Tri
---
I'd also like the 5.56mm Pistol, the 12.7mm,  Hunting Revolver, Plasma Defender, basically all the guns from New Vegas. Such a great selection there. And while we're dreaming about things that'll never be, the Ammunition breakdown and crafting system from NV. Best we'll get is fucked in the ass by the damage nerf and One Wasteland.
---
Eh I dont see it that way  
---
I see it as a way to finally bring back a huge roster of weapons and to flush out the balancing system. Having more weapons means that not only can we have more variety. Having more weapons would allow them to better balance and flush out the weapons throughout the level lists and maybe a lot of the new guns could be high level exclusive, so they could be actually usable without being legendary. It would add more endgame and maybe even spread the guns throughout the regions to make it somewhat easier to get the gear you need. Maybe even make some guns expedition exclusive to incentivize people to do them.
---
Also imagine all the atom shop skins they could put out for each new gun. Also with new weapons it could help repair the economy a bit from all the duplication.
---
I randomly ran into a wanted person at the crater and I normally ignore them but I got this new v exp gatling laser and had on my good pa. So I dumped on him and started a short battle until I hopped over a barrier to reload I hopped over and they were gone. It was short but sweet lol!
---
Well our characters don‚Äôt anyways
---
Thanks do you happen to know when patch 22 is coming out?
---
It is Northeast.   Don't believe the doubters.
---
Yeah I was about level 5 and I thought this level 400 dude wants to go PvP with me and I was like not a chance I'm outta here, now I feel really stupid as I could of probably got some neat stuff
---
Except not enough people will Uninstaller or cancel their memberships for it to make a difference, and at that point they would just cut their expenses, downsize the department  eventually shuttering the game. It will never get there though, because people will just leave their subscriptions active and then come to reddit to make themselves feel better.
---
My points haven't been all over the place. You just don't want to hear that your bitching and moaning is pointless. You want your feelings to matter to the developer, and you can't stand the fact that they care more about profit than about what you want.
---
Good luck with that mentality. All you'll do is stress yourself out and accomplish nothing.
---
Either get use to it or play a different game.
---
Oh lol bummer. Good luck mate
---
It‚Äôs still 3.5 months away from Winter still time to see if Steel Dawn is coming with their schedule
---
It sounds like an issue with your build. You shouldn‚Äôt be combining melee and heavy weapon cards period (unless you Are farming a low level area and your build doesn‚Äôt matter)
---
You can run a sniper or pistol with melee build if you want options but you can‚Äôt run two builds in the same tree at the same time.
---
Once your build is more optimized, things get easier to kill and you use a lot less ammo
---
Edit: Regarding the weight perks, there are backpack mods that require friendly rep with each of the factions, getting one of these will free up three points.
---
Also, think carefully about how much weight you have on you, for my most optimized builds I don‚Äôt have weight cards. For example food is everywhere, there is no reason to horde it
---
And the classic potato gun damage
---
Yes I couldn‚Äôt fast travel to this camp either but I went there and bought an anti armor 3* fixer for 10,000 caps
---
Next week 15th September
---
Nice find. üëç
---
you could just fast travel away
---
Yeah this is why I run melee. Less of a problem lol
---
Welcome to Fallout 76, enjoy your stay.
---
If my dumbass could at least make a few suggestions, I'd take your weight reduction and crafting perks and swap them out for damage perks, only swapping those out for the previous ones when you're either overencumbered or actually crafting. My heavy guns character has many non-combat perks like Ammosmith or Super Duper but I only equip them when I'm crafting. Same with Pack Rat or Lockpick. That should help you with dealing a bit more damage, I'd think. Also, choose your current weapons wisely. The temptation to use multiple weapons at once is so strong in this game but the reality is that you can only really run 2 or 3 at once. I was trying to juggle .50, 5mm, fusion cores, plasma cores and flamer fuel all at once before finally accepting that it was more viable for me to just stick with the .50 for long range and flamer for short range.
---
If you aren't bloodied or junkies, try to find an anti-armor legendary. Possibly instigating too for trash mobs, I think if your rate of fire is high enough it applies over multiple opening shots. If you're used to a good heavy weapon though your base dps is something like half with a commando. Where commandos make up for it is with being better at landing headshots and sneak attacks.
---
On my commando I started out with a quad assault rifle. The dps is lower than combat rifles, fixers, and handmades but they have super low recoil so it's easy to stay on target when aiming.
---
Later on I ended up with a junkies combat rifle, an anti-armor fixer, and I think a furious handmade. The fixer is what I stuck with, especially with the nerf to junkies coming up. The fire rate secondary effect is best but aim damage isn't bad, I think that's what I've got.
---
Thats closer than i thought it'd be only 3 days away
---
All i really want is R91 assault rifle
---
here is a rough plan of how i would dedicate those legendary perks. since they updated NukesDragon for the legendary perks. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f179f36&amp;d=sq2sr0s32s01sb2s22pq1p10pe2ee2eh2ek1ei2cm2c72cr0cu0ic4ib0ip2id2s12a12a72a01x43x93x83x63lt2l71lu2ls2xq3xe3&amp;m=051c9fe87b3](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f179f36&amp;d=sq2sr0s32s01sb2s22pq1p10pe2ee2eh2ek1ei2cm2c72cr0cu0ic4ib0ip2id2s12a12a72a01x43x93x83x63lt2l71lu2ls2xq3xe3&amp;m=051c9fe87b3)
---
though it is not final until Patch 22 hits
---
If your short on lead there are several places with dumbbells and weights you can get 80-90 lead per collection, little bit of server hopping and you've got lead coming out your ears. The best place for this is the prison I forget the name of, the one where maddog lives, because it has a bench for scraping right next to the weights so no messing about with O.E etc.
---
Twice yesterday I got kicked off the server within a couple hours. ü§∑üèΩ
---
You‚Äôre a good man.
---
Yes I don‚Äôt use them I can make them but I‚Äôve never rolled one or had one drop  but if I ever change my build it will be around this gun it‚Äôs basically a 5 *
---
Just use a flamer with the healing flames card. "Stop running from me! It wont hurt you! I'm helping!!!!"
---
Just put on power armor before mapping to them. Those are usually pretty cool camps to visit.
---
Sad that anyone still plays this game
---
I always thought they were hackers lol immediately went to another server.
---
Lol, some don't know any better.
---
Niiice. üëç
---
Thanks for all of the feedback!
---
I hope this helps bc I ran into the same problem but I haven‚Äôt seen the way I got around it posted anywhere.
---
1. I installed both the t-fuse and the blood sample on my first try and it didn‚Äôt work.
---
2. I tried the solution on Bethesda‚Äôs forums but it didn‚Äôt work.
---
3. I exited the server I was on.
---
4. On new server, I went onto the terminal and selected ‚ÄòAnalyze Blood Sample‚Äô WITHOUT installing the t-fuse.
---
This worked for me just a few days ago so hopefully it helps.
---
I‚Äôm so bad at pvp.  I need to do what you do
---
Yeah, kinda in the same boat to be honest.
---
My account name is cagyleopard6462 I am 145
---
I was talking about my 2 shot. But i can see the confusion. I have had truble selling those i got. But i kept one of them. 
---
I got a Minigun earlier today: bloody. 25 fire rate. 1 perception. Is it worth keeping/selling?
---
Fucking this guy. You have a magic Gauss Shotgun my dude. Enjoy it.
---
Some lead farming locations I used:
---
Vault-Tec University: first floor and Vault underground both have gym areas, while workbenches are on the first floor.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary: many handweights on the playground, and workbenches nearby.
---
If you have Pack Rat perk, you could try [other locations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lead_(Fallout_76)) as well.
---
Man, I can't even get those plans to sell for 10 caps. So I usually just dump them at the overseers camp, or if I'm stopping by somebody else's camp and they've got reasonable prices and/or a nice camp, I'll unload all my extra plans, chems, junk, and legendaries for them. Not worth the .25 in my stash.
---
I have a full 15 points for melee or heavy weapons depending what im doing. Not a huge fan of melee Against the raid bosses but love it for everything else. 
---
It‚Äôs nice to have though, on those servers that lunch like six consecutive nukes and exhaust my ammo reserves it‚Äôs nice to still be effective without bullets
---
Also, if you want faster fire rate, don't shoot in first person.
---
Exactly, and not only that but one can simply be unhappy with how the new camp turned out, and having to rebuild the old one (including the objects being green but not being able to be placed) can get really frustrating very quickly.
---
I have an Instigsting Explosive pump shotgun that I've used for over a year. Anti-Armor would be a good one, but the explosive one is what I like. Naturally, vampire shotguns are pretty solid, too.Really though, if you want to do a shotgun then you should run with all the shotgun perks on strengths and the enforcer perk on agility.
---
10 years is a long time. We shouldn‚Äôt worry about the future. Just enjoy the present state of the game and if you don‚Äôt, voice your opinion.
---
What stats you got on your mini just curious to see if my ts 25 gauss mini would go magic
---
I have written randomizers and unless you put in the effort they are going to suck. 
---
One specific thing randomizers usually rely on is the clock. If you roll too quickly, the seed will be the same and you will most likely get a same or very similar roll. 
---
One thing I've noticed is if you alternate between buying a weapon and an armor piece it gets more varied rolls. My guess is that it resets all of it's values that it uses to generate the random values of you pick a different object type. 
---
So pick slowly and alternate and see if that helps. I did 6 rolls like that and got 1 out of 3 good armor and 2 out of 3 good weapons
---
That would be a very hard thing to do right? Hack into a game like that
---
While we're at it, maybe the fusion powered mini-tank could carry more weight than a person with a backpack?  
---
Also, the jet pack should either not eat fusion cores so fast or last 2 times as long as the SS Jet pack (which uses no resources whatsoever).
---
Congrats and if it was someone passing the plan to their mule character, they should've done it on a private server or gotten someone to guard the ice machine for them.
---
I'd love to get the Fixer someday. Never got the plans despite doing Encryptid a few dozen times. Saw the plan in a vending machine once...for 30K caps.
---
I‚Äôm a melee build for 95 percent of the time. Come the queen or colossus I swap perks to heavy. I‚Äôve also got 8 in commando I think it is? Can‚Äôt remember. But as I say drop your psn or add mine and send me a couple of screen shots of what your running
---
I think it has to do with a camp loading in or out as you open your map.
---
Ah shit I thought it was op messaging sorry mate
---
I run a AAe combat rifle with a quad 25%ffr assault rifle.
---
&gt;Obviously most features of the game are tied to an online server
---
apparently it'd be really easy to host local worlds. it seems the main server does very few things and most are just security checks.
---
I got anti armor, 50 limb damage(thats the magic), and 250 dr while reloading
---
Yep, it has crashed over 2000 times for me since launch, and every day twice a day since the last update. I am kind of getting used to it now.
---
not sure but i'm sure it will still show the red text if you are trying to steal from someone else
---
Common sense would require people to differentiate between using hacked weapons and non-tampered weapons.
---
And that is my whole point in my reply here, you do not differentiate but want to ban those that are able to kill a boss in 2 seconds, no matter if it's legit kill or a kill with a hacked weapon.
---
Cannibal cannot be activated in power armor. Also being an herbivore is more convenient anyway since you can grow your own crops and make soup super easily (also soup is great for us speed demons since it fills both food and drink meters). Personally I prefer carrots since enemies have a harder time destroying them vs corn or razorgrain.
---
Why not use bandolier?? You‚Äôll be carrying a lot of ammo with you at all times, so why not make it easier to stay stocked up!
---
Lag is a different story. There aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbloodied servers‚Äù or ‚Äúheavy weapons servers‚Äù, which is what people claim.
---
Question: How many players here have quit playing the game for the day because their stash and characters inventory was full to overflowing with unwanted legendary items?
---
I know I have!
---
My opinion, there shouldn‚Äôt be a limit on selling. There should be a script currency limit of 2,500-3,000. 
---
Here‚Äôs why:
---
We buy one for 100 sell it for 40 so the taxman just made a 60% depreciation tax. We get them for free for completing events/quests then sell them to get ‚Äúprofits‚Äù that we then use to buy a random for 100 just to sell 98% right back at a loss. So why have limits when players are just going to spend every little bit they have every day?  If there were no limits then more people will play longer. That may even mean more people will spend real $$ for fo1st and atoms because just maybe they‚Äôre happy to play the game.  A system like this rewards the industrious player while not hindering the casual.
---
If the devs are worried about crashes do to script sales at grandma‚Äôs house don‚Äôt have them.
---
It's probably not that rare, but it's really good for fights where you don't wanna use stimpaks. I have a Vampire's Gatling Laser and I don't have to heal during SBQ fights anymore. I'd hold onto it if I were you.
---
Your comment implies you don‚Äôt play anymore(you say it‚Äôs sad) what‚Äôs more sad is the fact you don‚Äôt play, still follow one of its forums and actively comment üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yea half way through Earl's 2nd health bar too. No one had lights on and no teslas either. Used the last of my fusion cores as well and got no reward for it. On the plus side I did farm some cores for the first time and wow is that easy I should've been doing that every time I got on.
---
That's pretty good. Also try to find a furious explosive or faster fire fixer/handmade/etc for the tough bosses. If it's gonna take 10+ hits, you get a 50% damage bonus from furious
---
Cool thanks for replying mateüëç
---
You have high expectations which Bethesda will never do (and even if they try to do, it will be at 20% done properly). Between countless bugs with gauss weapons, magical weapons still existing and some weapons having close to none modification capabilities I don't see it.
---
Some weapons skins having at least few skins while other ones not having even one since release speaks for itself.
---
A lot of times when this happens to  me I FT to the camp a second tume and it puts me at the camp.
---
Dude we're neighbors I go to school in Chico
---
I hope when the servers do shit down that they do this, purely from a game preservation mentality. Having a game completely unplayable one day is extremely disheartening. I hope this is a long way off though.
---
Hmm
---
You need to work on your build. You shouldn't be having this much trouble and seems like you are trying to spread yourself across all fields of play rather than focusing on one to give yourself an advantage.
---
Looks like a decent heavy gunner build - my main is a commando but I do have a similar character. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty much allergic to QoL cards though like bandolier, travelling pharmacy, green thumb and gunsmith though so my build maxes out the heavy gunner perk and would try to add in blocker to strength, cut perception down to 3 points for glow sights / concentrated fire and swap gunsmith for maxed out demolition expert on intelligence.....unless I could go down a faster fire rate route instead. I also love maxed out adrenaline
---
I'd suggest you use vats once and take a look at the screen, reading skill is required.
---
How's it feel on explosive weapons?  It'd be nice to see the fatman in combat as more than just "lol, gun maek bewm."
---
Naa, that dude doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
C and Z can switch the target on PC.
---
I have seen them as well and after a leaving the map and coming back a few minutes later they are either green or gone, so just a guess.
---
I've  gone through that emptiness several times on 76, but I keep coming back.  It's a kind of meditation.  I'm very excited about legendary perks though! I've really got to think about my build and carefully buy the right legendary perk cards and ranks.
---
I think it would be great if we could buy a copy of the server to run on our local computer instead of renting one with Fallout 1st.  It could allow us to customize our own Fallout Worlds and share them with others
---
I didn't know that was stacked that much.

---
&gt;Except not enough people will Uninstaller or cancel their memberships for it to make a difference 
---
So you're stateing not enough people will do it. And then literally the following sentence.
---
&gt;and at that point they would just cut their expenses, downsize the department  eventually shuttering the game. 
---
You're all over the place. Why are they shutting down departments if no.1 not enough people will do it no.2
---
&gt;It will never get there though, because people will just leave their  subscriptions active and then come to reddit to make themselves feel  better. 
---
Where is the part they're shutting down departments if nobody can impact it and everyone will come to reddit to b\*tch? I think you're spouting a number of different points you've read online, and specifically this sub but you have them all mixed up and intertwined. You're consistently contradicting yourself from one sentence to the next. It's like when someone reads just headlines and says those when someone mentions something in the news. I can see what you've read on this sub and are regurgitating but you definetly don't have a grasp on the points youre making. And you've flipped flopped about trying to give different reasons as to why it wouldn't work with zero consistency. Pick a train of thought and stick with it.  I'm gunna take a step back. You've made a post about something you later claimed,
---
So from the beginning the game was rigged and was going to offer zero discussion as you'd already made your mind up. What a pointless echo chamber karma farming post if you already knew how many times people had said this and you don't think what you're saying will change anything. I'm still saying troll.
---
I'm a PC/gamepass player as well, I have 1st and I'll be on for the next few hours, so just give me a shout if you want to try a private server. 
---
I just did that quest yesterday and a private server worked a treat for me, but I don't know if I just got lucky.
---
EDIT: Same goes for anyone else that might be having issues they think a private server would resolve. Just give us a shout, I'm quite happy to invite anyone that needs it. Can either DM me on reddit, or ping me on discord (Gingie#3269)
---
If anything I try getting guns that dont share ammo as I eat it as is.
---
Every gun does that. A ts shot weapon counts as 2 hits for durability. A standered laser with a sitter on it counts for 5. And those are doubled if the gun is explosive as well. It's not just legacys
---
Still trying to get Whoopsies, hasn‚Äôt heard about Wendigo cave as a location, will give it a try.
---
Enjoy the newness of the game.
---
What makes it worse is that since its Bethesda, its actually believeable they would do it.
---
Sounds good tho
---
This bug is frustrating, tried about 6 times now using different methods, still no dice.
---
I'll try the private server thing somehow.
---
I usually end up with around 10k .50 cal rounds on my heavy after a lead run - you can go through ammo fast, up to around 2k-3k during an SBQ fight, so 10k isn't unreasonable if you want to make sure you can do three queen fights back to back. That makes bandolier a bit of a necessity, which cuts into your ability to run a melee build, even swapping unless you dump all the ammo into your stash when you switch. Maybe consider using a plasma or laser gatling, then you only need batteries included.
---
Every once in a great while, the system seems to throw a lot of extra mobs at you. Had this happen in a silo, then at the Queen event, it appeared that 50 or so creatures popped every time the Queen landed.
---
Took us almost the whole time to kill her, people were running out of ammo, but it was one of the best fights ever.

I know what you mean, usually I try rampaging the purveyor after throwing scrip away but on the first day of the sale I got a few good rolls
---
Happy cake day
---
I've been thinking about this exact thing for a long time now too, and even posted a couple comments about it. The engine *can* do it; we can build up entire Settlements in Fallout 4 and then save them and even transfer them between PCs with mods. It should be very much doable in Fallout 76 to save an entire C.A.M.P., and then switch between them, as said, without having to rebuild the entire thing. Simply blueprinting parts of buildings just doesn't do the trick.
---
As for how many slots we could have for this, as well as whether those could be sold for atoms would be up to Bethesda. What would also be amazing is *trading* those saved C.A.M.P.s for other people, for free or as a bartering item, or to your own alts and so on, although I see how this one might cause a lot of issues.
---
Also, whether it would cost currency to swap to a different C.A.M.P. would be up to Bethesda to decide; the materials used to build that C.A.M.P. would be tied in that save slot though.
---
But yeah... I've built some amazing homes for myself and it has felt awful to let go of them forever simply because I want to build somewhere else on that character. Having at least like 3-5 of them available would be nice.
---
If you hate it now, just wait for One Wasteland

You can to an extent.  Usually immediately run into something the second I take off running though with no time to try and avoid it lol.
---
Who uses instrument weapons?
---
Thanks for the kind award /u/Smitje!
---
Doesn‚Äôt the SS jet pack use action points?
---
E is the use button, so I think X or square for a PS controller. It's the same button you'd normally use for lockpicking
---
No joke was one hell of a battle but failed the event lol...like you said it seemed like 50 adds would pop up when she lands. You turn around and see her infinite army charging on youü•∫
---
I think I leveled up three times...there were so many creatures to kill.
---
If you're meaning for dps, prolly not.  I like the Luck effects for entertainment value. I like my Mysterious friends.  Nothing like a quick revive when I get stupid.
---
Also, I play Snipe and my Stranger triggers almost every time I target in VATS. Love to sneak a mob, target the furthest enemy, Mysterious Stranger comes out and draws aggro, and I just stay in my crouch and pick off mobs shooting them in the back of the head with Sneak bonus.
---
It's the simple things you treasure.
---
^
---
Should have been more specific, I just meant resources you eventually have to renew like fusion cores.
---
If this did happen there shouldn't be any build limits anywhere at all.

Makes you play dead by daylight so stay as far as possible
---
I never get PvP‚Äôed as I take the workshop and leave right away. I also stay right on the edge of the workshop area while claiming so all I have to do is take one step and am no longer in the PvP area. Easy peasy. My only compliant is being notified of having to defend it, take it over or that so and so is contesting it.
---
The issue isn‚Äôt how to make pvp better in this game...it‚Äôs getting people to want pvp.  The majority of players want nothing to do with it.   So naturally the developers abandon that portion of the game to appeal to the mass amount of players.  Fallout isn‚Äôt a pvp game.  None of them ever have been.  They are a single
---
Player games, and most single player gamers don‚Äôt want pvp.  Not saying that‚Äôs good or bad just stating a fact.   The pvp fallout community is vastly smaller than the non pvp.  So Beth is gonna appeal to the masses. Like it or not, Pvp will be completely removed from adventure mode before long.   It‚Äôs just a matter of time, expecially since most pvp is considered by many players as griefing.
---
Thanks! The bandolier and bear arm looks interesting. I dont use energy weapons though
---
I usually keep a weapon if its my best, but I use and carry like 7 heavy weapons at all times. It sounds pretty good. Plus with the ammo factory you can make about 1k 5mm bullets and hour which is 2 reloads. I primed all my other heavy weapons, so my minigun is there to keep me from wasting the good ammo. I'd buy the minigun if you'd sell it.
---
As someone who carries enough bullets to blot out the sun, bandolier and batteries included are a must, I could cut back on stims for reviving people and cut traveling pharmacy. All of my guns are VE so grenadier helps with tanking against hoards. Base perception can only be 1, and with a Max legendary perk it becomes 6 leaving me with one unused slot for green thumb
---
I agree with OP. I'm well over 2k hours in, and the only things that keep me coming back is the community/discussions/trading. Otherwise, 
---
I would have quit long ago.
---
I dont play with a mic, but wish I could find similar players to enjoy the game with. Sadly all my fo76 friends have left.
---
Thats mostly a problem with explosive energy weapons. Use gunsmith
---
Honestly I‚Äôm excited as hell. The game needs more end game content and this will be good
---
Ive usually got a bunch of diluted ones on me most of the time. I keep my health rad gated most of the time, so if things are dicey and I'm actually taking damage for some reason Ill pop one for the slow 15 PT regen pr whatever it is, and you can revive others with them during events.
---
If youre on PC what's your IGN?
---
Damn, is it that bad? My vampire's plasma thrower broke from 200% during a solo run, I can't imagine it breaking even faster outside of a daily op but I haven't used it in a while
---
Good one
---
Theoretically, every Explosive weapon except for the AGL should be very minimally affected by the additive change due to the lack of mods that increase damage. AGL should still work great, regardless. Bloodied or Junkie's won't boost Explosives as much, same as everything else, but you should be more than fine.
---
gunsmith and luck of the draw
---
When legendary perks arrive, you can get a respec-free extra three Strength perk card slots to run Traveling Pharmacy and lose the PA-and-hazmat-suit-denying reliance on the chemist‚Äôs backpack, while still keeping whatever other Strength perks you already value more that T.P.. Just a thought. (But yeah, in the meantime I hate it too when I respawn in the nuke zone.)
---
I would love it. They should add also a carbine rifle (5 mm carbine fron NW), sniper rifle from FO  3, a watz laser pistol/rifle, m 1 garand, a m 60 machinegun plus new mods for curent LMG, cryolator, 50 cal machine gun and gauss rifle.
---
Great suggestion!
---
As long as it comes with an OG mode that way new players in the future can experience the harsh empty world 76 was at launch.
---
Anything yet?
---
I'd happy if they buffed the pistols too
---
You'll have trouble keeping up with a commando's ammo requirements just by looting even if you're spreading it across .45 and .556. Get some excavator armor and go through Lucky Hole Mine, it will yield a ton of lead ore. If you're short on steel start looting weapons and scrapping them with the scrapper perk. Acid for smelting and gunpowder is dropped by bears, cave crickets and snallygasters.
---
Batteries included works with fusion cores. Can never have enough batteries for your best toy
---
i dont think so
---
Healers aren't hated, but accidentally stealing everyone's rads at an inopportune time can lead to some sudden outbursts of profanity. Especially during mid combat.
---
its a cosmetic, its worth whatever people are willing to pay for it
---
Then that will be a probelm in someone elses camp lol
---
I put penta barrels on my magic gauss mini gun.
---
Yea ik. Gunsmith is still broken (I think, seems like it at least) and luck of the draw ar max rank still does nothing lol. That thing is the definition of a glass Cannon lol
---
Honestly fallout 76 is a walking in the park compared to survival modes on 3 &amp; 4. 
---
Dont worry about sucking at level 80, I was level 100+ before I got a build that was viable. 
---
For less ammo and more damage you need to look at the meta builds.
---
 You have bloodied, which although very powerful requires some decent and expensive armour + lots of perk points spent in damage and energy resistance. 
---
Then you have junkies, by far it is the easiest build to play, with the armour and weapons being a lot cheaper and easier to come by. (Most people will tell you to go vanguards with your armour however they are all wrong. Get yourself some bolstering armour)
---
Then there is mutations, they are essential for this game, adrenal reaction/marsupial/healing factor are three that I wouldn't play with out. 
---
With you perk cards, things like lock pick, hacker, superduper etc are all ones that need to be swapped out for damage and AP refresh. Only equip them when you need them. 
---
Then there are what are classed as quality of life perks (QOL). these are things like white Knight and lucky break or weight reduction perks. Try your best to avoid running around with these equipped. 
---
I would suggest going for a sneak/vats/commando , make sure you put plenty of points in agility/luck/perception. Concentrated fire perk is you friend, it allows you to start popping heads with ease. 
---
If you are after ammo then your best bet is to farm chems with the pharma pharma perk, once you have 100 + of a few of then make a post on the market place forums. Things like physcotats and overdrive with sell for 40 rounds of .45/556 with ease. 
---
If you are on ps4 incam probably donate some ammo and stimpacks, I'm not non for a few hours though.
---
Oh and one final thing, till you get your build sorted stop using stimpacks, honestly just die. You drop a bit of junk if you are carrying it but other than that there is no real downside to dying.
---
Yeah, apparently with [Update 22](https://imgur.com/a/kATARGl) as per their own website
---
It's not a problem it's a trade you're giving durability away for high damage , I use a be flamer myself so I know how it feels to hear the snap every 200 rounds but it's stupidly overpowered when used sneaking and you're lucky it's be and not tse those break every ... two shot üòâ
---
It doesn't help that much even from when it wasn't broken, which I'm pretty sure it still is. It and luck of the draw still dont work
---
As a recent Rifleman to Commando convert, a Handmade works well for me. Currently using a two-shot but I'd love an anti-armor one. Still looking.
---
One of the most useless legendary perks there is. Who in their right mind would spend 300 perk coins (that are not easily re-obtained after you have scrapped your perks and used them all up) for a perk that you basicly already have. It takes couple seconds to swap the normal lockpicking etc perks when you find (rarely) something you want to open.
---
I just remember that a picklock worth a 10-caps-bounty....
---
Can you use multiple legendary perks at a time? If so it would be very handy. Added strength and poison resistance from funky duds would be a great help during boss fights
---
Perpetually overencumbered (or so it seems) - WR armor will help you a lot.  Excavator with motion assist servos (+2 STR) and calibrated shocks on each leg.
---
It took me quite a while to get high DR armor with 2nd or 3rd star for WR for ammo, aid, junk, and weapons, plus one with AP regen and one chameleon.  Add Deep pockets.  High capacity backpack (at the cost of reduced RR).
---
SS Underarmor for +4 STR, +4 and +2 on 2 other Special categories, + 15 each DR, RR, and ER.
---
Only equip crafting perks when you need them - otherwise, use those points for either offense or defense.  Same for lockpick and hacker.
---
Decide which you want as primary - melee or heavy.
---
15 STR, I give most of my points to melee, but give 1 to bear arms,  1 t bandolier, 1 to one gun army, 3 for incisor, 3 for martial artist.  AGI gets 3 for stabilized.  PER get 3 for tank killer.  It lets me switch btween melee (vampire switchblade or SS ghoul slayers, depending on where I am),  and auto/semi autos as needed, adn still do a decent amount of damage To whatever I‚Äôm trying to kill.
---
Lucky hole mine + excavator for lead.  If you find everything, you‚Äôll walk out with about 600 ore.
---
Smelted with super duper3 and chemist, you‚Äôll get more lead than you know what to do with.
---
healing factor mutation will reduce the number of stimpacks you need to carry.
---
Vampire weapons.  My faves when I think I need a heavt are a vampire 50 and a vampire gatling plasma.
---
You do it in 13 mins without glitches?
---
I totally agree. I have a camp at the top of Seneca Rocks and if I re-camped somewhere else, I'd never be able to recreate it the way it was. Certainly not with the blueprint function, as it's so picky with where you try to place the blueprint.
---
Followed this?

---
Gunsmith is not broken. It definitely helps
---
Ps4 here. Thx tho!
---
When did gunsmith break? Either way its a balancing thing. Are you using improved repair kits or manually fixing your weapons? Weapon artisan is helpful if its the latter and you arent already using it.
---
I second this
---
I would run a bloodied or junkie build but as I am a junker I gather all the junk I see and sell it or turn it into ammo. So a good amount of mu perks a spent on weight reduction
---
I thought exactly the same thing, thought I was going crazy too
---
Would like a skin for my Shishkebab (Benimaru) too. Idk what's up with the hammer either it's not *that* great of a melee weapon.
---
Even still I don't want to completely respecc because of a bug
---
Personally at this point I doubt PvP would return to how it was and player vending does cause a new challenge but the wanted system helps with that if they did. Killing a player or damaging your camp unprovoked cause them to become wanted then other high level players will hunt them down and take there caps. Being just a murder in 76 has always been punished, it just used to be punished by the players who were against that playstyle. 
---
But I don't think it would get back to that point. I'm fine with just allowing private teams to be able to group aggro for PvP so at least we could easily fight a workshops together. Right now if I'm attacked at my workshop my friend can't help me unless he gets shot.
---
I did play survival but for me it was a bit to unrestricted and because of the low player base, that was all that happened was PvP. I like a more natural mix that adventure mode used to bring.
---
If you one shot most enemies I'd recommend grim reapers sprint, it's very helpful for groups of enemies
---
Crit will still help. Max out adrenaline and skip the covert ops. Tank killer is good, still go for bloody mess. A rank of gun fu is useful. Depending on if you use Vats, dodgy will help you be a little more tanky since you‚Äôre going to get shot at, but it costs AP. In a run and gun build you‚Äôll need to stack damage with adrenaline since you don‚Äôt rely on stealth multipliers.
---
Energy weapon have always been made of paper, still the same and always will be :-)
---
Only two mods I use on my flamer are vaporizer nozzle and napalm canister, since explosive makes up for the poor range. Everything else lowers durability too much IMO
---
Jeez are you all masochists lmao. Why do you want these things to break so fast. How is it fun playing repair simulator?? I'm out of repair kits I had saved from the SBQ and I had like 20. And yes. I have all the perks. It still breaks way too fast
---
If high level box rewards legendary loot, this perk will have more worth to invest.
---
Same. Cheaper than month-to-month (It breaks down to $8.33 per month vs. $13 on the month-to-month plan). Plus you get 1650 atoms each month (which I guess works out to about $16 of atoms per month).  Stashbox changes everything.  Private servers are nice and the survival tent is nice.  
---
If you do the math and use the monthly subscription more than 7 times a year then you should consider an annual subscription instead.
---
They need to add handguns to the game first, not the upsetting, passive-aggressive BB guns we currently have.
---
But yes, more handguns! I would like this.
---
I'm right there with you! A few hours a night on the weekends after the kids are in bed. Currently at level 51 on my laptop since August. Had to start over after a storm zapped my PS4.
---
Still a good time with a lot of great people!
---
This is why, even though i like the flamer and energy weapons, i will never use them lol
---
2 sec earl kill, is not legit when world record solo is 20 sec.
---
I don't mind it at all , I only use it on boss events to deal tons of dmg and run around whit 300+ repair kits in inventory ... I need to burn some of those üòÑ
---
Any idea if they're planning to bring back the othet stuff like the Beret, Uniform, Flag and Standing Emblem? 
---
Been away for some time, wouldn't mind being able to grab these.
---
Yea i agree. This thing is a power house (and it still kicks like a mule even on the PTS with the nerf) but it just breaks too damn fast
---
I know that. It's mainly for completionist reasons as the Ultracite CS plan is quite possibly the only PA mod plan I don't have. :)
---
You mean my quad explosive cryolater? Just throw it away
---
They had those, but they removed them because griefers used them for trap camps and spawn killing (long before Pacifist Mode).
---
Dont think they should be
---
Yes you can. Starts an event called a colossal problem
---
Personally have better luck with the penta to trigger magic. For me anything under a 140 fire rate is iffy. Though there is now video proof that even a 98 fire rate can have magic. So yeah tri is better if you can have consistent magic otherwise go penta.
---
How bout an explosive one?
---
Everyone on here is so weird. I come to reddit and it seems like you all WANT the nerf, want to have your wepaons break, it's so bizarre. Everyone else not on reddit seems to say the opposite.
---
I've played since beta so even with legendary gear  I found fun. I do agree with you that it was and still is a bit unbalanced and duping has not helped but imo that's not a good reason to punish PvP. That would be like removing SBQ because of magic weapons doing to much damage. Its not solving the root problem.
---
Also not everyone PvP uses that build, only the very aggressive loud part. I'm a full PA tank build that is made with surviving damage my main point and do just fine in PvP.
---
Neither do I, but they have sucked since beta, they've had opportunities to fix but they never do... my BE laser rifle destroys things, mainly itself :-)
---
There a currently 4 different paint jobs for the Super Sledge other than the base one.
---
It's not a bug. Flamers just break fast. And explosive ones break twice as fast
---
I mean theres nothing to fix. It's not broken.
---
Your aim is for fixers or handmades mainly, try to get AA or bloodied, TS kinda bums out on accuracy bc of the additional shot. Combat rifle and assault rifles are good too but the main ones to get are fixers and handmades
---
Yeah, a new currency would be a headache, just remove the script cap and limit the sales. Just like legendary modules and vault steel.
---
Because I'm a bit crazy, I use a radium for most pve adventure. I also occasionally grab a workshop for the xp. I find it also works well for pvp.
---
Best I‚Äôve gotten is and instigating, reflect damage while blocking Tenderizer. Was really hoping for a Bloodied swing speed one.
---
Make a LFG
---
NUKE ZONE FOR YOU
---
It definitely is tho. No gun is supposed to break that fast. And why? If anything a flamer is just a barrel of fuel, it should break really slowly.
---
i have them for 250 caps each. I would say go to my camp but it's not there. 
---
BUT if you come to me at lost home i can sell you the ones you need. I have all of them. just tell me which you want. GT: rammadeus. Your GT?
---
Gunsmith is working perfectly fine this guy just doesn't understand that the quick durability loss is a balancing thing
---
I reckon it‚Äôs the commando mindset.....made worse by running with weightless armor for a long time (not any more though) that‚Äôs made me super frugal. 
---
Given the choice I would have blocker over ammo weight reduction for sure though. Running with PA does need efficiency though so I might choose to invest in power user instead of batteries included or maybe a cut down combination of both. 
---
If you ran with Faster fire rate weapons rather than explosive ones you could do away with demo expert as well and solve that problem entirely. 
---
Regarding grenadier, I am sure that grenadier did nothing for guns with an explosive legendary perk, so grenadier still doesn‚Äôt seem right to me.
---
My heavy gunner is only level 140 ish though so I couldn‚Äôt use legendary perks in the way you have been able to.
---
The best thing I got from this sale is caps from vendor robots when I sold the garbage Grandma gave me.
---
It could still function the same way as with the vendors, put a vendor there and people can come visit it.
---
So far the tri barrel eats stupid hard. I cant imagine the penta doing anything crazier but i do intend on trying it out
---
Haha lol
---
That would be ideal yeah
---
I know Steel Dawn won‚Äôt happen yet but will the BoS still be arriving in patch 22?
---
Yea, the extra accuracy is kinda tempting me
---
Ok man
---
I agree...that would be so much better...esp when we get 3 legendaries per ACP...and you can only turn in 3 a day for scrip
---
Yea, that one is spendy.  I‚Äôve seen it twice - once for 15k, the second was 12k.
---
At least when the nerf happens I have the option to go to other parts of the map and fight appropriate levels, finally use guns that were previously unusable due to poor ammo crafting (I'm looking at you, LMG), and maybe try a build other than bloodied without being severely outclassed. If you're using an extremely fragile weapon you need gunsmith and if you don't have it that's your own fault
---
I'll humor you...
---
&gt; world record solo is 20 sec
---
According to whom?
---
Ive suggest this a few times before and it never gets any traction, usually gets the immediate downvote treatment then lost to the void, glad to see this one actually going somewhere
---
trickle that shit down yo
---
"Fix"
---
Only very minor presence during Daily Ops mission with new one npc
---
?
---
ehrm...
---
Just because it does not work on a gun that's been outside the scope for ages, does not mean it's broken.
---
Oh I completely agree with everything you said, that's why I decided to have a "dying breath" type post to at least say I said my peace and tried. But your right, if the game was not Fallout the PvP part of the game would not have been treated like it did. Just sad Bethesda can't try something new without having to create a whole new universe to do so because the fan base will protest anything new with the title.
---
I need dps more than ever because of the nerf tho. So by dumping like 5 points into intelligence for it im not super hyped
---
Bloodied would be a dream! Five bucks says she gives me machine guns tomorrow lol
---
Oh lad you shouldn‚Äôt have stoppedüòÇ items back from beta that aren‚Äôt available now can get you so much good things
---
I think we all are given the chance. Thank you regardless. :)
---
I'm not all over the place, your ability to comprehend a point that counters your own is just severely lacking.
---
If you want to bitch and moan, then bitch and moan. You're not special, you're not the only one, and you're complaint isn't magically going to be the one that changes the way they do business.
---
Normal non legacy flamers still break fast bro. This game is cooked
---
I‚Äôm aware. I didn‚Äôt say I was using a legacy now did I?
---
Most of the ones mentioned are from NV, and since Fallout 4 they're making in game weapons more stylish to the nature of the setting. Which is why pipe weapons exist and the use of a assault rifle which looks like a busted exhaust
---
It only works if no-one else is has the agro of the enemies look at this https://youtu.be/8OONwLXf2p8
---
Bye Felicia.
---
I used to have diluted ones, however they're a liability when doing the imposter event. So i switched back to normal ones
---
We have .45 ammo in game, and what gun symbolizes the use of .45 better than the 1911?
---
*ghoul looks in my general direction from a mile away*
---
YOU HAVE CONTRACTED RAD WORMS!!!
---
Wait. The radio is player specific and changes due to current location?
---
Lol I just rolled that on PC
---
not the point, so not gonna discuss this. point is, you guys as a community is exploiting, and i understand it beacuse of the fucking grind bethesda making you do, but you dont even admit game is bad or you do exploiits. you all just sit there pretending everything is fine, thats the problem!!!
---
Yeah, this. I can legit not remember when the last time was that I needed to open a 3\* lock or terminal. 
---
Silos maybe but that's just about it.
---
I think there is a price for the HUD  at Vault 76 cc. 200 or 250 gold bars üòÄ -   but if you know how to get them free please share üòé
---
Was one of my favorites in NV. Was really looking forward to finding one when i saw the game had .45 ammo, but no...
---
I got a j pa str sheep staff, I'm pretty happy with it
---
Blood eagle, super mutant, grognak‚Äôs battle mace, and the new season has a spiked bucket- I‚Äôd rather have new weapons full stop tho, the trend of skimming weapons into totally different models doesn‚Äôt seem as fun to me (albeit easier to balance). I‚Äôm just wondering why it took half the game‚Äôs lifespan to get some new melee weapons that weren‚Äôt from far harbor ü§ß

---
I‚Äôve had the same weapon and exact same effects roll twice a few times.
---
Use a mule? That‚Äôs a good option
---
the problem is your CAMP is built to fit the terrain it sits on. placement in another location will not allow floors to sit proper. i know this by trying to relocate using blueprints
---
The reason you go to game events is to bypass the currency limit- you get a handful of legendary rolls (up to 6 if you‚Äôre clever) when you launch a nuke. I don‚Äôt see a point in complaining about mama mumbles when papa Earle is giving me 8 legendarios a day on the side anyways
---
Was this lucky soul wearing a scout outfit? Lvl 40ish?
---
The environment in Fallout is never equal not even for PvE. What's the difference between a player out leveling you and stomping you as apposed to a deathclaw that surprised you and smashed you out of nowhere? There is none except how people take getting killed by a player which is generally worse for some reason, guess its more personal?
---
I wish they would make the factions joinable and really fit the role but that does not seem to be what they are going for that and I feel people would be upset they couldn't join them all on one character.
---
I would settle if they just added back that private teams can group aggro PvP so if I'm getting shot my friend can actually help without him having to get shot first. I would be fine with that and workshops being buffed to increase interest.
---
bethesda tends to go after troublemakers on a larger scale.  they go after the hacker and the dupers rather then the resulted items.  duped is MUCH harder for bethesda because duped items become legit items.  if they see a badass weapon on your toon, they cant prove that its duped or not.  now if you are holding 5 or 6 of the SAME badass weapon, now they caught you red handed.  they know its 1 in million chance you got 5 of the EXACT same copy of that weapon.
---
i remember seeing angryturtle stream and his GF embarrassed him because he jumped in her account and saw a collection of duped armor.  she claimed ignorance but it was 110% duped.  she has 5 legendary scout armors with SAME gold rolls LOL.   if she or anyone has such luck, one should be buying a lotto ticket then playing fallout.
---
so owning any suspect god roll items is no problem, 90% of players already do it (wither they are aware of it or not).  i know i own few items that i know may have been duped or not (but its legit to me because i bought it).   you cant simply say "i will not buy duped items" because you CANNOT tell.  unless all you want to do is buy pipe rifles and baseball bats, large percentage of good items on sale are duped (but now legit!)   i dont stress about it, i just stay away from obviously hacked items and just enjoy the game how i want to.
---
You don't need to be so hyper focused on dps, i dont really understand this. You have the most op gun in the game you don't need more dps
---
Not long ago you were a good guy for using a Tesla and just tagging everything and legendaries.
---
The SMG, the tommy gun one, is pretty low on the list for good commando weapons unfortunately.
---
It has some advantages, like the huge magazine capacity, low recoil for ADS and a decent rate of fire, but VATS accuracy is not very good at longer distances and it suffers more damage drop off than any other commando gun.  Because of limited mods, it‚Äôs also not as AP efficient and you have to sacrifice some damage for an armor piercing receiver.
---
I had a two star b/ffr version for a while, when I was playing a bloody unarmed character a lot and was looking for a cheap automatic for some ranged capability.  It worked ok, but mostly because bloody automatics are/were just insanely strong.  I don‚Äôt remember the asking price, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have paid more than 5k for an SMG, even with two outstanding effects.
---
I‚Äôd sell it, because it‚Äôs a decent gun and someone will get some miles out of it.  Be aware that you‚Äôre not likely to get rich off it.  The person who buys it is likely looking to get starter/mid range gear on a junkie build.  99% of vets will already have something better, and usually want faster fire rate as the second star.  The price is up to you, but I‚Äôd feel very, very lucky to find a buyer at over 8k.  2-3k seems to be more reasonable for the budget of someone who could really use it.  
---
If you‚Äôre feeling community minded, that‚Äôs a great starter gun that would be perfect for a raffle on the trading sub.
---
...... All right, my mistake. Maybe I have a heavy sequela since I got my flamer broken and chased by Earle around that facility for two rounds.
---
I want a bear claw skin for the mole mine gauntlet
---
a wooden catana skin for the board
---
And a scythe skin for the super sledge
---
Any of these are fine really.  Combat rifles are basically Fixers without the sneak bonus and the assault rifle is ugly but quite effective.
---
No, the camp stays where it's been built. You're just able to build another one without demolishing your old one as it's saved into a slot.
---
I'm not trying to be a prick and go against you just saying the gun is a lot stronger compared to others , the durability is the only downside I use only napalm tank and vaporization nozzle to have the biggest durability Whitout losing dmg because explosive makes up for range and instead of having a big mag where the gun breaks before you need to reload I prefer reloading more often but that gun has a bit more durability just my opinion
---
What do you think would be fair in terms of loosening the restrictions to?
---
Upvote
---
You buy the helmet and it comes with the mods, you just have to put them on.
---
So annoying that the q4 fractured steel is prob delayed ala wastelanders again imo.
---
ah i understand now.
---
Junkie doesn't require any perks, but... it's going to not be much better than anti-armor or apparently furious after the incoming nerf.
---
I still for the life of me haven't figured out blueprinting. The blueprint budget gets full like a quarter of the way through and ai cant blueprint my entire base.
---
Ha, never considered that. I like the minigame but not the perk swapping, so I was planning on just having rank 1. Most camps had level 3 locks so rank 1 won't auto-unlock them, but I can totally see trick camps switching to level 0 locks.

Think what confuses people is that, at least according to my experience, there are always two different spawn points.

I sign-up for it every 4-6 mos to load up on resources and free up some CAMP storage space.
---
What weapons and armor are you using? Are they modded for max damage/protection? Just curious. I would farm lucky hole mine with excavator PA to get lead.
---
Even without VATs I'm hitting 1600-1700
---
I own the T-65 helmet üòÅ - HUD is separate purchase as a mod.
---
XP is always a good excuse to do stuff in this game. With LegPerks and the Season 2 Run, it's really one of the main reasons to do stuff.
---
I've come to a point in which I throw Legendaries on the ground after taking my daily 150, and only keep reduced weight ones. I get way more than I can scrip anyway, and the weightless are the reserve for the days I don't play enough to get more. 
---
It has worked well so far.
---
But that requires a steady amount of drugs and that's not easy to do.
---
I'm with this guy. When I see a camp like that I keep on walking north, to that patch just west of the Crater. You know the one, with the herds of Radstag all over? I like deer hunting up there. Usually until I have enough meat  for a couple dozen explosive baits. THEN I come back and blow that scab factory to smithereens!
---
Camp building is just about all I am interested in. I would love to have multiple camps and then choose which one I want to use when I load in.
---
1600-1700 damage
---
I have that as well and I just don't understand where it's coming from.
---
I know it's Electrically Charged + Unstable Isotope when you or a teammate use/share Strange in Numbers but I don't have either of those mutations on my character. 
---
Unless Strange in Numbers somehow shares mutation effects between team members there is really no explanation for this happening on characters that lack those two mutations.
---
Scrip limit is bullshit fr
---
Fixers &amp; handmade are your end game but don't overlook decent interim weapons like the combat rifle or even maybe assault rifle. A good roll on these weapons can often be better than a so-so one for the fixer/handmade.
---
Oooo, I‚Äôll have to get on that. Still seems like a lot of ingredients though.
---
I bought a hooded rags, is that a good buy?
---
Mules are life.
---
Yeah I agree.  The encounter you described with chasing back the attacking ‚Äúraiders‚Äù who were other players sounds like an amazing time and I‚Äôm sure it was.   But that won‚Äôt sell atoms...lol.  And most single players just wanna farm xp and plow through npcs.   It is what it is,  the fan base for fallout, which is who mostly bought and plays this game normally.  They don‚Äôt want pvp content in games they play.   Ie: single player fans.  It‚Äôs a hard sell and Beth is doing what any good company would do I think, appeal to the majority.
---
Highly doubt that, I usually have around 30/40 luck and I seem to drop same rubbish as before. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Pschological projection followed by straw man arguement
---
Already sold it, but honestly thanks a lot for taking the time for the detailed explanation!
---
Explosive energy weapons always break quickly.
---
Sweet I already got that have to move perks around for luck and perception
---
People have said it's tied to the ash piles.  I have the mod that turns piles into presents and dont ever notice frame rate drops but tbere will be graphical glitches if alot of people are using them when I look at the presents.
---
Bethesda knows that with the modding community their games have, they don't die like most other games do, so they know that even after its demise, 76 can make them a whole lot of money if they sold it as a "Memorial Edition" or something like that, so you can bet all your sweetrolls that they are going to release it.
---
Or at least that's what I hope.
---
Or better yet, if a player is within a camp, and pvp with camp owner is not currently taking place, trap damage == 0.
---
How nice of you to point out your own shortcomings. Saves me the effort!
---
I actually love you, thanks a lot üòÖ
---
Sounds like AA is gonna be very good post patch, so who knows...
---
i already done that quest some time ago
---
Fixers actually have higher base damage than combat rifles. They come with a calibrated receiver that just boosts critical shot damage and it's still higher, I think it's 48 per shot versus 40, which is pretty significant.
---
Yeah, it's not the point when you are asked to prove your words.
---
As for the rest of your rambling... gtfo, you don't know me at all. i was one of the first that told beth, whitelisting processes is not the way to catch cheaters.
---
You are just a salty old hag that has gotten her bra twisted and is now unable to react in any other way than to attack.
---
So once again, by Felicia.
---
Half the stash space, no scrip, no vending machines, no damage cap.
---
Madness! Madness I say!
---
If you're going to use big words, it helps if you know what they mean btw.
---
21 and they are already dropping free stuff. Dang
---
There should be a prompt for when you're picking locks owned by players. Camp locks are obvious. Locks that already in workshops that appear safe to pick are less obvious as to whether or not they're owned by a player.
---
you are correct, your choices are mostly meaningless in fo76.  your choices may vary the BS details, dialogues etc.  in the end the result is same.  only time it ever matter is when choosing how to hit vault with foundation or crater.  the quest to hit vault is very different and each one has a different unique legendary that you can get.  its the only time i saw your choices matter at all.  
---
another times i saw your choices matter is commander daguerre's questline.  if you proceed correctly, ATHENA will become a vendor that randomly visit your camp.
---
It would make sense for that game world to follow the story like we experienced. 
---
Having Wastelanders come in would be tied to completing Scorched Earth, like getting the Prydwen was tied to getting the signal repeater up and running (whether you helped or not)
---
Kinda, we are getting daily ops which are based around the BOS on the 15th of September. Bethesda has more info  [Here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview)
---
But be prepared to hear both yes and no
---
That's the quest you are asking about?
---
How do they become a liability during Encryptid?
---
Make sure to get grouped up with high levels it‚Äôs a boss battle down there.
---
I guess I'm weird, since I don't sneak with rifleman.
---
Maybe I'm just weird like that.
---
What is it called?  The targeting hud?
---
A good player starting early. Respect
---
I like this, and hope they could do it.
---
But what about displayed items?  If you have items in a display case in camp A, and switch to camp B do they just go back to your stash?
---
Ok now ill be even more confused lmao.
---
Object lacks support, object can't be floating, object can't be in water...
---
"FINE SIT IN THE DIRT!"
---
Are you saying I can get my camp budget back if I delete everything stored in my camp budget? Does this still work?
---
Addictions don't wear off so as long as you steer clear of addictol and radscorpion egg omelettes it's just a one-time thing, around 5 each of the five chems you want to get addicted to. But for a handmade, after the nerf, there's only around 5% more damage than you get from anti-armor so it's maybe not worth the addiction penalties.
---
those aren't rare or anything. The good stuff is Hunters long coat, longshoreman, winter jacket and jeans. You can sell those for 5k+
---
They also have the wrapped cap and some clean versions of things which i don't think spawn in the world.
---
AAs or explosives are nice, but. from what I‚Äôve toyed with, a lot of it depends on how you use it.
---
I am a melee build with auto/semi-auto as a secondary (I give 6-7 PER points to rifles -  ground pounder, tank killer3, concentrated fire1, and I can‚Äôt remember the others.
---
With that disclaimer -
---
I got a 2 shot explosive handmade from Fashnacht (wildly inaccurate hip fire, but great when using the scope).  Explosive + wild shots makes it decent for tagging mobs.
---
Got an AA fixer at meat week - really high damage when sneaking, but no more than a regular fixer when hip firing.
---
Scoped explosive combat rifle does more damage than the AA fixer on hip fire, but less when sneaking.
---
Explosive lever action - much better hip fire accuracy (and) damage than the TSE handmade, AA Fixer, or expl. Combat rifle..
---
Vampire SMG (.45)- great for tagging at events like UF, but still has enough power to kill any MM that gets in the way.
---
expl. Ghoul slayer 10mm SMG:  SS ghoul slayer switchblade is faster and more efficient.
---
I didn‚Äôt have the supplies to share when I was lvl 20
---
Cmon bruh you really think they hold it the whole time you‚Äôre logged off
---
It doesn't
---
Yeah - because its a combination of many things that cause the hitching on certain parts of the LL
---
Someone is going to reverse engineer the server code at some stage (if they haven't already) so I wouldn't be too worried about that.
---
Well when we are logged off our characters just kinda cease to exist
---
I don't think I even had 36 radaway at level 21 lol.
---
Not great I don't think
---
Brotherhood of Steel Commie Whacker!
---
More weapons drop than armour so I do 3 weapon scrips and one armour. Perfect
---
Nah you just start playing a different one üëΩ
---
Didn‚Äôt have supplies either but now I drop stims, radaway food and water to the low levels who wave back to me
---
I believe so, I need to see the catalogue.
---
Crit savvy. Better crits is a trap card. Four leaf is nice but you usually don't have the slots for it as there are better cards to use in its place
---
When you act as a pylon, you either have to constantly spam them or use vampire weapons with a high rate of fire and big ammo capacity
---
With no great and safe way to trade items between characters? There should be a in game mechanic to transfer between characters without relying on friends, storage containers or private worlds.
---
i personally have seen it work on both Explosive weapons, and weapons with the Explosive prefix. Missile Launchers, Auto grenade, and Fatman. on explosive bullets legendary the explosion itself looks the same size, but i feel it does make the blast damage radius bigger
---
I do when I see them. It‚Äôs a rare sight tbch
---
Powerfist.
---
Yes! I also highly recommend low level pvp!
---
Ive seen this term B2515 tossed around a bit, what is it?
---
Probably was a vet player with a new char
---
This post makes me want to resurrect my BF2 Knife &amp; Pistol server.
---

Technically.. isn‚Äôt delayed because winter starts at Mid-December until march 2021
---
Ahhh. I usually run a full set of troubleshooters armor for it, so I'm usually fine.
---

---
Without limits an online game like this would be horrible for new players. Its that simple. If you have too much shot in you stash then sell it cheap or toss it at a train station to help other players
---
Hey, so I looked.  No option to buy it with gold.  Can modify it on my helmet though.  Pretty sure they're free
---
With Daily Ops coming and stealth being disabled, I‚Äôd been doing some thinking and planning on how to work around this with my rifleman turned commando.  I dropped Grounded because a b/ffr plasma rifle is one of the better options once stealth is taken out of the equation.
---
Either an auto or flamer barrel can shred enemies, even outside of stealth.  I think the flamer barrel may fall under rifleman perks, but the auto barrel is still excellent.  Since Ops are mostly short range fights, the travel time of plasma bolts isn‚Äôt an issue and flamer range is fine.  The plasma gun is loud, but disabled stealth makes that a non issue.  Noise is the only reason I don‚Äôt use a plasma rifle now.
---
I also just finished a suit of protocoled T-65.  Since I can‚Äôt sneak, I may as well have as much defense as possible.
---
I agree. Like I said its just sad that we couldn't' get a different type of experience out of the universe then just the single player feel without going completely different like fallout shelter. But yeah your 100% right just sad its that way as others got a taste of the game they wanted and it was slowly taken away.
---
I got a full set of unyielding so yeah
---
I had a feeling. That would be an exceptionally odd difference between platforms.
---
No, I have 3 of them
---
Dang üòÅ I thought that I had a rare buy. üòÇüòÇ oh well, keep on looking I guess.
---
add klennm if you want help, I can give junk, food, weapons, armor, a build made on nukes and dragon, and etc.
---
How come better crits is a trap card? Is it bugged?
---
You can do it solo aslong as a friend stays in a server. It‚Äôs an option if your finding it that hard with your stash?
---
Never got the chance to see his attack effect, he was killed instantly on 5 occasions I did the event.
---
You have up to 6 legendary perk card slots. The 6th/last opens at lv 300. And you can equip as many s.p.e.c.i.a.l. legendary perk cards as you like. So no, there is no limit.
---
Thanks for the award kind Sir! /u/KhroneBerzerker
---
I'd say pretty much any if you consider good secondary and tertiary effects can outweigh a bad primary. My full hp commando uses an AAE combat rifle and a Suppressors 25/25 combat rifle. The AAE might seem like it has more bang but the Suppressors near zero ap makes it a beast.
---
The level 21 wanted to trade with me and when I accepted the trade request my guy was loaded with stims and Radaway
---
Make sure you grab the holotape
---
but did you do your dailies for an extra +80 script?
---
This post came up as recommended. Why would anybody follow this. Are you aware of what a joke 76 is and how Bethesda screwed so many people?
---
You can slot in 6 in total although that will require you to reach level 300. Not to mention the next 300 or so levels to get enough perk coins to upgrade the legendary perks.
---
May have been an alt. What lvl are you
---
Yeah, except the assault rifle was used in flashbacks before the bombs dropped so it‚Äôs just a stupid design. It wouldn‚Äôt kill them to add some pre-nuclear weapons with weapon designs more influenced by America‚Äôs arsenal in the 70‚Äôs. I feel like Bethesda is trying to force a 40‚Äôs tone over the game with the music tracks and weapons and it‚Äôs limiting how they can evolve the style of Fallout.
---
They should first release the new FO76 weapons such as the light machinegun (M60) and 10mm SMG as a Creation Club item for Fo4....
---
Would be nice as the helmet cost a lot of gold. I also see that people say that the x01 mods should work on the T-65, so I could buy them at the Enclave from Modus. Thanks, I will see if I can mod the helmet as it is now!
---
The exact same thing happened to me as well today. I was just standing there stark bollock naked with the diseased mirelurk spawn nibbling my feet when a level 18 appears and shots the thing.I did get a bit cross and blasted him with my gauss shotgun.
---
Afaik none of the npcs can jump
---
Heh, can you imagine the cryout? :)
---
Are the slots account wide of character specific?  If I have a level 300 main, will my new level 5 alt have six slots unlocked?
---
For bosses you cant go wrong with an anti armour
---
Started like 4 months ago and I‚Äôm only level 70
---
The Chinese Assault Rifle from fallout 3
---
Ah. Most likely was an alt then
---
Thank you.
---
you can shove 6 legendary special cards into your 6 slots. bewared though. your perk card slots only can get to 15 MAX so you cannot cram more then the normal amount of perk cards into each section (like 20 STR worth of perk cards)
---
That is non-trivial, especially with the upcoming additive math.
---
Slots are account wide but the perks are not
---
They already tried that and people complained about them diluting the pool. How many people have you seen with a settler gauntlet or sheepsquatch staff? And how many do you see with a deathclaw gauntlet or power fist?
---
Pretty sure perk slots are account wide. But they only activate at level 50. And the legendary perks are only leveled per character.
---
I run bloodied and I‚Äôm just happy to be saved. People
---
Just run by 80% of the time nowadays
---
Most likely yes
---
Do you not want any balancing factor? Game gets pretty boring when you just run around destroying everything in half a second with no downside
---
You don't have room for it.
---
It didn't have the scarred body that scorched things usually have, but it was glitched so I can't say if it was passive or hostile.
---
There should not be a limit on selling, just a limit on total currency on hand say 3,000 or so. The trickle down effect will still happen because we buy for 100 &amp; sell for 40 until we run out of script. Then we grind events which means more high levels in game to help lowers win events. 
---
Then your mule can hold tradable items not junk!
---
Oof. I'm at level 252
---
&gt;their own pathetic existence
---
I think you might be projecting a bit...
---
Okay, so at level 50 on a new character, if I have my main at 300+, then that‚Äôs when the level 50 gets their six slots unlocked?
---
If you want to use realistic weapons  go play litteraly any other game.
---
Happens sometimes, use a different silo
---
I have that issue when I die in indoor environments....after death I can see my character standing at the respawn point, however I have to click A and select a Respawn point on the world map instead of just respawning as normal. If I‚Äôm overweight when that happens I can‚Äôt respawn anywhere then as well
---
Guaranteed there are always people who need the info
---
One example of the ingame interface not giving enough information. These topics shouldn‚Äôt be left to speculation.
---
&gt; How do we eat in the power armor
---
Emergency Induction Port.
---
I would also add Skeetshooter for better spread and accuracy. Bloody Mess adds nice effects.üòÅüòÅ
---
For now, two pieces of poison resist armor, fireproof perk and an asbestos torso lining work very well.
---
After Tuesday, the legendary poison/fire resist perks are going to make Earle very easy to deal with, not to mention legendary mirelurk queens and blood eagles with molotovs.
---
That's 5 slots you can use right from the start when the patch drops next week. :)
---
B is bloodied, 25 is 25% firerate and 15 is 15% faster reload.
---
well when you come to another players locked door its red and when you hit unlock the lockpick mode activates.  But it seems with the perk all you have to do is press x and any level 3 locked door will auto unolock.  So it will be easy when you are locking around someones base to accidentally unlock a loocked door with one button and get a warrant.
---
No challenges till Tuesday
---
You‚Äôll get better luck using a sub dedicated to this sort of thing. This sub doesn‚Äôt allow bartering posts.
---
They‚Äôll be back Tuesday with the next season.
---
My opinion game play would be better for low levels because high lvls would be more willing to run low events instead of grinding dailies and bailing.
---
Hahahahahaha!
---
there is a bug where if you die you respawn dead, this was really prominent when the update came out but was patched but still lingers, maybe thats what your experiencing?
---
I have a bunch your welcome to take one if you want
---
my TS/E flamer is one of my strongest guns. I expect it to be delicate
---
Why did this get removed?
---
Now they just need to add a cooking station at Earle‚Äôs fight...
---
The Red Rocket garage door is bugged as well, Bethesda doesn't seem to care to fix it.‚òπ
---
Not cool bro üëé #savetheowls
---
If you are going with bloodied, definitely go with Emergency Protocols. PTS Note for Upcoming Content: &gt;!Inside Daily Ops, the ability to use a Jet Pack helps a ton with trimming off time to unlock the best tier of rewards.!&lt;
---
I play full health power armor heavy weapons, so I stick to Jet Pack, since the utility is amazing, but for keeping yourself alive as a bloodied build, Emergency Protocols is best.
---
Love the 1911. Would be great
---
Should be, but I haven't she's the pts myself. Just did some reading and watched a few videos. They could always make changes last minute
---
I have one of those as well. Just picked up the mishmashed ts set for encrypted. It helps, and you should be able to get the pieces pretty cheap.
---
Hell yeah!
---
The legendary run is over
---
I want the .223 pistol to make a reappearance.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.223_pistol_(Fallout)
---
Alright. Thanks for the input mate. Whats the changes they are making on tuesday, in this respect?
---
It‚Äôs the name of the unique 10mm pistol you get in Fallout New Vegas inside the dinosaur gift shop
---
If this is happening a lot, then it might be worth a database rebuild just in case.
---
You will find instructions here if you need them.
---
https://ag.hyperxgaming.com/article/3074/why-you-should-rebuild-your-ps4-database-regularly
---
It does best way to check is to shoot in front of you
---
Exp energys are the most over powered thing in the game so they brake alot that's the down side there will be no "fix"
---
No, were not accepting it but realising that it will be fixed since they've made the same mistake in the past and always fixed it then.
---
I tried bromancing him and got the cold shoulder.
---
Thanks a lot Beckett.
---
I just wanna find love in the wasteland.
---
I love this idea! I have a cool Halloween camp. I was going to just leave it there until Halloween, but that is so far away, and now I found somewhere else I want to camp. If I could just save the first camp, I could do a new one and go back to the old one for Halloween, no problem!
---
that was one of my favorite songs too why did there have to be a gender reveal party
---
Well every time I try to play the game. I‚Äôll see if it happens to other games
---
He's just not that into you.
---
Get the Raider Punk.  The way he calls you 'Tiger' is really all you need.
---
Nice. Itll take me ages to level up the cards though. I've prepared however, I have 27 level ups and 11 perk packs waiting to be opened
---
The game used to have these, but players abused them to trap you and kill you instantly as you fast travelled to their camps. So they were removed. But workshops still has them.
---
We do need a .45 pistol.
---
I would like to see the Webley. It could be modified for both .38 and .45.
---
You can really only blueprint small, stand-alone  structures and some of their contents. I experimented with it in workshops. It's handy for NW because you can blueprint a small defensive structure and just deploy it. I made a platform to shoot from, and a small hut with a turret inside. In some areas it looks like part of the map, so it's a good place to hide.
---
Yep. Looks closed when it‚Äôs actually open, but still can‚Äôt walk into the garage. I just took the garage door off until they fix it.
---
Not sure if you're aware but there's no real reason to try and escape the mine aside from that chest near the entrance. I always stay behind to loot and kill more spawns. You'll just be put outside the mine when the timer goes off. You don't lose loot or rewards.
---
I honestly feel they could at least extend our storage by at least 50 or possibly 100 or extend the scrap limit by 50 just to make it abit more breathable and still be restricted though
---
I like this statement even being a primarily bloodied player. I might have to use it. Tch, thanks for the heals baka. Lol Thanks for the chuckle.
---
It's been a while since I did that quest but I seem to remember that there was a terminal in the auto cache that you have to hack to register the pipboy.
---
You did that?
---
Edit: 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Elusive\_Crane](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Elusive_Crane)
---
Wiki link. Check if you did all of that. If nothing works, try fast travelling away and going back in, that usually fixes most of the Wastelanders related glitches.
---
I am ok with PvP being at workshops however i would love if the turrets you built actually defended from intruders.
---
I tried doing a nuke a long time ago. Sadly I got to the end and realised I had no idea what the launch code was...
---
Same here.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
That plus a dense mod for chest armor finally stopped me from constantly killing myself.

The overseer ones need only be brought to the overseer (make sure you have at least 100 scrip worth of room).
---
wtf? do you have +luck on every piece of gear?!
---
Then I have no clue. Sorry.
---
You‚Äôve accepted the game
---
Which one? I'm not violating rule 8 beacuse I stated specifically that I'm not promoting or condoning the usage of these, I'm documenting glitched weapons as a hobby.
---
Can power armor start to take damage better than the guy with the back pack too?
---
Become friends with the raiders and get yourself a ammo machine for your camp
---
I said that cause it was a funny response and if you can‚Äôt figure it out go to setting and read
---
I didn't know about skeetshooter, so as a shotgun main, thank you for letting me know that exists
---
I will do the same, but will have to relocate my vending machines from there. Sux that this is an issue,  as it is pretty much the only functionality that Bethesda would have to test thoroughly. Apparently quality control is not their forte.
---
Even if you write you are not condoning or promoting the use of these, you are by making posts like this. And the one before this. Reporting.
---
Thanks man. When are you getting on again?
---
Then I count myself fortunate that they work as well as they do!
---
I think it is under Perception.. but not a 100%.üòé

The countdown can get glitched. If you fast travel away, then back again to the silo, it sometimes fixes it.
---
About a week ago had a 200+ drop a Vampiric Tambo just out of the blue. Didn't know if he was just cleaning out inventory or being generous, but it was appreciated.
---
Didnt say you once was against exploiting. Didnt say you never reported. I am saying you gave up. I am saying you are placing your tent down to glitch a spawn. And I am saying, that you are ignoring that glitches and exploits shouldnt be allowed (due to dissadvantage for players who dont know them and play the intended way), and I am saying that bethesda don't give a shit. And to make everyone happy, you guys pretend glitching is not your fault and a part of the game, and bethesda pretend they dont know whats going on and everyone happy. Thats what I am saying. I am saying that those players who play fallout 76 on a high end game level, are tunnelvisioning this game. That is what I am saying. I also observe how fucking nasty this community is, but completely fucking ignoring it. All you hear and all that is getting upvoted, is those nice moments. Everything bad is getting ignored HARD. time after time. This is hard facts. 90% of the time I am porting to scorch queen, she dead by the time I get there. Design fault? My bad for not being there in time? Yes, blame me. Blame the player that ported to the event, exited to play. Blame the guy who wasnt there and oneshotted that shit. Its not bethesdas fault for having a massive failure of an end game event, nope. Its not the players fault either for nuking the shit out of it somehow, when sometimes I see 12 people shooting non stop on her and fight takes 4 mins, but other time she dies in 2,5 sec. Something isn't right here. But who's fault is it? Its MY fault! This is the community atm. Its discusting. Yes, I am old and angry, but I am right. Thats the thing. Tell me to gtfo, tell me nasty shit, I dont care. The point is, what I just said, is right. You guys as a fallout 76 community, is completely ignoring the bad stuff, living in a tunnel vision world.
---
Maybe one year for me, but basically yes. I had 25k steel after my month
---
Hmmm.  I was able to romance him with both my male and female alts..... but I used the flirt option as I was progressing through his main questline.   If you didn‚Äôt flirt with him, maybe it‚Äôs too late?
---
It‚Äôs an option, but it isn‚Äôt a good one.
---
The bear thing should have been a skin. 
---
When it comes to skins, they should exist mainly for the weapons everyone goes to. Like, DCG or 50 cals. 
---
Creating new weapons which become irrelevant or are not used (Tenderizer syndrome) are good only for overloading the server. 
---
Gimme a Ghostbusters skin for my Tesla, damn.
---
I'd rather have a BoS whacker.

\+10% Damage when hitting a BoS Initiate.
---
I've seen it rarely too. I wish there were more adds in the fight by default, makes it a lot more chaotic and fun. Those fights where she rarely lands are a snooze.
---
They're really useful for smaller, grouped together items. For example I use the conduit and rug glitch a lot and have full shelves, and potted tato and corn that I'd rather not have to redo... that said I haven't moved my camp in months.
---
Yes but without limits we would see massive inflation on simple things like ammo and stimpacks.
---
Plus there wouldn't be any "cheap" legendaries because people like me would just end up tossing anything that wasn't a God roll weapon. The limits are there to keep the game balanced and fair.
---
Yeesh, 
---
1. How am I promoting the use of these weapons by making a post? I'm not encouraging others to use these, and NW Weapons are fairly widely used,almost like legacies. I'm using my own time to make these write-ups to inform others, not promote the guns.
---
2. Where do we draw the line between legacies/other hacked items? You can argue that everyone that posts about the beam splitter handmades are promotions, by your logic.
---
And you‚Äôre still commenting üòÇüòÇyou DO know the recommended is based of the recent searches and views of a person.
---
Also, as a result, some people are selling great rolls and they don't even know it.
---
You got plenty bro. Settle down.

Why is it fun to play ‚Äúhave an overpowered gun that can kill any normal enemy in 1-5 shots making the game boring and it having normal durability‚Äù? Do you not know what game balance is? If you expect every gun to have the same durability should should‚Äôve quit at the start when you realized they don‚Äôt or dealt with it. Not making a pointless post complaining to people who don‚Äôt agree with you
---
I've had that problem, the game has crashed on me in the middle of the fort defiance event
---
It's been like this for a while. Since you need to use VATS frequently, you'll probably want the Action Boy perk.
---
Agree with this, although I have to say there of plenty and I mean PLENTY of really neat looking firearms from the 40s that would look great in a fallout game with or without modification from bes
---
They'll probably make it a skin.  And if they do, I would say there really is no hope for this game, and definitely not for anybody at Bethesda Game Studios Austin if there are people to greenlight such a thing.
---
Thanks a lot. That worked
---
That's not a thing
---
A lot better than complaining on Reddit and not wanting to use the options available and then still thinking for fuck sake tho isn‚Äôt it. So crack on :)
---
Hey nice one for it being suicide prevention day.
---
Tri, I have it on all mine cuz the extra damage is worth more in my opinion over accuracy. especially once one wastland drops and you have hit enemies harder than a semi truck.
---
Yup - I still blow myself up occasionally even in PAüòÅ
---
The game needs more weapons, full stop. Even if they're almost identical to other but with different mods, I wanna feel unique Atom damn it!
---
Mama mumbles and papa Earle ahhaha ! Cracking me up
---
Wendigo cave is down near atlas on the map. Theres a quest that takes you there. But i forgot which one.
---
Thx üëΩüíö
---
I thought they fixed Tanagra Town after the Christmas event?
---
Same here, only decent guns I got are untradeable (Gauss Minigun) where I already have a decent version.
---
I have a mule. It is an option. It‚Äôs a ridiculous option that in no way should be necessary to play the game. But you think the real problem is people trying to get the actual problem fixed? Instead people should use bandaids like mules? I am sorry but that is simply ridiculous.
---
Tbh why dont they just make currency not have a cap?
---
All the rare masks were 1%
---
I'd go all out and have a 1x1 square room with switches(that are labeled) that control a lightbulb over each letter, but it would murder the c.a.m.p. budget.
---
I have hardened receiver, thought it was better than vicious?
---
Aww yeah, I've tunes my build to let legendary strength flow right into the mix \^\^
---
The same way we catch diseases?
---
Yeah, the only mob-specific armor that's somewhat in demand is Troubleshooter's for silo runs and the Encryptid event. I got all of mine from vendors - mostly by getting lucky in finding dedicated armor sellers with a wide selection of merchandise.
---
Apparently there are enough Fallout 1st members that most people I talk to in game are genuinely surprised I don't have Fallout 1st.
---
If you can't find a Scrap Box at my camp, it's because I don't have one...
---
I will use it on level 1. That way I can get rid of six perk cards and the constant swapping. I don't really care about the auto unlock part.
---
That‚Äôs actually explained in the lore it‚Äôs got like I pee recycler or something
---
This whole game was about you being a detective  to figure out what happened. It requires your imagination. All of our answers are filling the gaps with imagination based on the info. Assumption without knowing. Your answer that it doesn‚Äôt make sense is the same assuming we are all doing but we are choosing to make it work. I guess we won‚Äôt ever know if it actually makes sense unless they give us all the answers which would be boring.
---
The only tool I see is someone telling me what to do in a game I paid for. Feel free to join a new world.
---
I caught it after being in starving and thirsty (-50% desiese resist each), rad-x active (another -50% plus mutation suppressed) and still took 10 minutes and multiple stims
---
What does she do with them
---
No problem
---
It's not just Bethesda, Interplay made the rule back in the day. Bethesda simply enforces it
---
Yes, but the awkward thing was that the bullet holes are very inconsistent.
---
It took a few tries just to say "steam".
---
I‚Äôm replying to you, dude. It‚Äôs probably because I follow Wasteland. A good game. No need to answer me if you weren‚Äôt gonna address the question.
---
People go insane for bloodied faster fire fixers and handmade rifles, but you can totally rock with an antiarmor SMG, an instigating assault rifle, an executioner Tesla... Your perks and build will determine your damage, not your weapon. 
---
My fav commando weapon is my bloodied + limb damage SMG. Two stars.
---
Well we leave it to the moderators to decide if your posts are against the rules or not.
---
Yes, I've noticed more crash-to-desktops for several days now.
---
Not really hunting for em, i got the set of unyielding because i wanted to get rid of a rare item and the guy offered that
---
Great accuracy, low magazines, fast reload. I can get behind this. How about a .38 (Super) mod? ;)
---
Gather lead, acid, cloth and steel. Craft your own ammo. With the right perks and route you can get about 4K 5.56 in about 30-40 minutes.
---
The exploit was patched a long time ago, there's literally no harm that can come from this knowledge spreading. People who are in the market for buying hacked or exploited weapons will be going for more effective things than this anyway, they're probably buying the 3k damage BE alien blaster rifle
---
Same here
---
Maybe the settlements can in some way benefit your camp. Maybe there‚Äôs a new resource extractor that you can buy for gold bullion which can only be placed in your settlement or something to that effect
---
That we CAN agree my dude
---
If they could somehow make a crossover of wasteland, FO76 and FO new Vegas
---
I‚Äôd shit my pants and never leave my controller again!
---
Your camp is portable
---
Yeah. Camp is essentially JUST ammo factories and vending machines? I saw that right before my game froze and crashed
---
This would be great, rarther than being forced to move server or loose access to your camp, place a backup camp that doesn't remove your old one.
---
This affects all charging weapons, including bows. Haven't had it happen in the PTS yet but it's been in the game for a while and doesn't seem like it's fixed
---
Cannot upvote this enough! My camp is at Top of the World and I‚Äôd love to be able to move near Flatwoods for farming/snaptail gathering sometimes. 
---
I am also imagining all the extra budget I‚Äôd have by removing things like water purifiers and food. It‚Äôd be a great release alongside perk loadouts. Massive QOL improvements
---
You comment makes zero sense.
---
There is a fast travel point at the family cabin east of it. Still a bit of a way but better than the fort
---
I got the exact same secret service arm pieces recently within seconds of each other, except one was left arm, and the other was right arm. I'm currently wearing both.
---
Guided Meditation üòÅ
---
How would there be inflation more peeps playing would mean more supply not less?  Cheap ones for who exactly low lvls who can‚Äôt use it anyway because it‚Äôs lvl 50?
---
You are so right.   I have all four.   The combat rifle has FFR and FR, and it's easily my favorite gun for all-around use.
---
I save Healing Hands for only the most toxic of the toxic bloodied players.  Otherwise I never run anything that touches peoples rads, unless they ask for and agree to something specific (sharing rad sponge to go running around a nuke zone, etc.)
---
Thus is good intel. Thank you Cassey
---
That why I dint get it. If it wasn‚Äôt bugged it would have been a cool buy

This is some bullshit...

I love OP guns.
---
Do the gun runners exist yet?
---
You can glitch through the doors letting you do a nuke in 15 minutes
---
You need 150 extra perk cards to level up 1 legendary perk to max. 
---
Just slot in the 5 you want the most and keep levelling up as usual. Scrapping the perk cards you don't want too soon will lock you into a single specific build. Getting the perk cards and level ups to switch builds again will be time consuming, so be careful. :)
---
that's genius
---
There‚Äôs lots of the small weights laying around that can‚Äôt be picked up and scrapped also, like in the Rollins Labor Camp.  Considering how lead is one of the few resources that higher levels still often need to farm regularly, this is super annoying.  I don‚Äôt necessarily want to have to hit the Lucky Hole mine every time I need to replenish my lead supply.
---
If you increase the supply of caps... the decreases the value of a cap... which leads to inflation. You need more caps to buy items since they are so plentiful.
---
Honestly such a great weapon, On my way! Of the best heavies that isn‚Äôt legacy and it shreds the queen, for my experience I killed it in sub par 5 minutes
---
I‚Äôve noticed less problems. Especially now that I updated my Nvidia driver. Stupid driver never auto-installs like Ive set it to do. Never notifies me of an update like I‚Äôve set it to do. But when the game starts lagging...I check the update.
---
Totally. They could add the BAR the M1 Garand, and the Browning .38 but just don‚Äôt for some reason.
---
I just do my daily quests and get about 50 scrip
---
You just described the whole game, a buggy mess with devs who don't care.
---
I never had any opportunity to do so. Ever. A friend said to keep flirting but it‚Äôs never been an option.
---
Gotta wash those feets bro üôÇ
---
I spawn 100% of the time literally on top of my module at its current location. But other players spawn a little North which is sadly right next to a cliff...
---
Man that would be awesome, there are also so many wonky prototypes from the 40s-50s that would fit perfectly in fallout.
---
Also worth mentioning, the Chinese had Galil rifles in the fallout 4 intro, so maybe a Galil as well? Lol who knows
---
Your personal hygiene seems troubling if it affects robots.
---
On a more serious note, that happens when the server decides that the mobs have not had any human player interaction for a certain amount of time and just kills them to spawn in a fresh batch. 
---
Normally that's done when no one is around and the corpses are cleaned up immediately so we shouldn't even be able to witness this but Bethesda coding is, well, different. ;)
---
I agree. They should handle scrip the same way they handle bullion. I‚Äôd rather have a stack of scrip notes I can turn in later than a mule who‚Äôs only use is holding garbage I intend to get rid of but can‚Äôt.
---
That would be a funny feature for the bath tub ;)
---
LOVE this idea. I end up never moving my camp because of how much time I pour into each one, this is a fantastic idea.
---
Not the person OP is referring to, but happened to me yesterday. Inexperienced with the game, running bloodied. Exited the mine and got destroyed by rads, dropping about 200 screws. Luckily this guy stood on top of my bag to prevent my stuff from being stolen. You guys are awesome :D
---
Im more surprised how I am able to get hurt from standing on a punji board, while in Power Armor. Those nails must be one of a kind lol!
---
Could it simply be to keep a stable in game economy? It infuriates me to no end.
---
Happens to me all the time with all manner of monsters.
---
Iunno.  I thought it was if they spawned for other players, to prevent overleveled stuff from ruining your day, but I don't know for sure.  Or why Whitesprings bots would be included, but it has happened for me.
---
The new vegas pistol is a hi-power.
---
Yeah, this is the closest/easiest FT location to the munitions plant.  I learned that when I had to do one of those Boomer daily missions there a couple of times.  
---
Actually, a lot of the workshops are some distance away from any FT point, and you end up just having to make that walk.  A lot of times, the closest spot has a difficult mob spawn (or several of them) which makes you think twice before just hopping there,  The Red Rocket complex is a good example - the closest FT destination is the House or Scares, which has a Wendigo and several ghouls to deal with as soon as you spawn in.   That cabin by the converted munitions factory usually has a scorchbeast flying overhead, etc.
---
Happened to me when the atom shop wouldnt load up. Closed the game and reopened and the store loaded and everything was fine. It probably cant verify your atom puchases/free claims when the shop is down
---
Just happens sometimes and always has.  I fricken swear every time it does happen, all the trash mobs spread out and attack everyone else and all the mirelurk kings/queens and deathclaws pile directly on me all at once and ignore everyone else.  Basically sit there and watch everyone else fighting mongrels in the background while I frantically try to stim surrounded by butthole mobs.
---
I'm still waiting for my dad to come back from the store.......its been almost 32 years I dunno what he is buying?
---
I guess I don‚Äôt understand how script has anything to do with the value of caps or the supply of them?
---
the 9mm is, not the .45 auto
---
Someone finally said it. I would love this. Have been saying forever I wish I could build a new camp without having to move one. I love building in this and like to try out new ideas and areas I come across.
---
Hm, okay. But I remember right now that the assaultrons mention some robot killings they are investigating. I was afraid the first time that they might be coming for me, but they were just walking around like normal.
---
The question is about all currency limits..
---
Anyway if we are just talking scrip, if there was no limit to how much you could scrip- everything would be scripped and nothing would be left for sale- which again hurts new players.
---
It's a trade only item so yes, it's really good
---
It sucks here in Oregon where I live. I can't see 2 blocks down the street.
---
Yep.  Spent any saved up scrip I had, and now I‚Äôm down to the 150 per day plus whatever I can get from events here and there, and I‚Äôve yet to score anything I might ever use.  Some stuff has been worth selling, I suppose, but there‚Äôs been a crapload of Broadsiders and Laser Pistols that aren‚Äôt much use even if they are bloodied or junkies.
---
Tbf it probally  shouldn‚Äôt even be an option
---
You show them to her, and she gives you 100 scrip, ending the quest.
---
Also, the board is just in the pawn shop and it‚Äôs for a bunch of paper notes. This holotape is part of those notes but doesn‚Äôt go onto the board.
---
I'm sure I do, let's see what happens....
---
Ofc whit a correlated effect : 
---
you don't smell bad
---
 +3 charisma +5% better prices and bots don't die when you walk by üòâ
---
Yep, 15 points into Perception and Agility, here I come.
---
Yeah my favorite is having a mirelurk scream a disease into my blood.
---
Very impressive.
---
Boy that escalated quickly Lmfao
---
Cheers man. Im a bloodied boy too haha. Pretty sure my play style is more like darkness from konosuba though üòÇ
---
Perk points, 5 pieces of ss unyielding, food+herbivore, mutations, under armour...plus at times it seems to glitch and boost numbers even higher when food bonuses expire and you eat again. No idea if it's just a visual thing tho, but I am at least at 30 all the time. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Interesting. I think I‚Äôm going to go try this.
---
:D
---
Have you logged into the PTB recently? That always resets my emotes, I don't use any loot bags but I wouldn't be surprised if that was affected in the same way.
---
LOL - hardcore junk management !!
---
There's lots of good folks out here. Maybe they just didn't notice :)
---
üëçüòé
---
The body of the post is only talking about script. How does it hurt a new player as in below lvl 50 that you are not selling that lvl50 bloodied rolling pin?
---
Thank u for the thorough explanation &lt;3 new players like me don't really know about this "secret" stuff, it's nice when people help each others
---
Got bloodied 33/250 50cal
---
Perk loud outs are coming. I‚Äôm just going to wait for that. That much grind to Auto Unlock things doesn‚Äôt really grab me.
---
ya, I was standing right beside him/her and suddenly they just dropped (literally) like someone took all their bones at once,
---
The fallout wiki has a handy table with all the shotgun perks, might as well get them all if you want to get the most bang for your buck.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons
---
What do you play on? I might be able to help you out
---
Yup, amazing serious apocalypse battle armour? Watch out for those tick bites tho!
---
Yep.  Well said
---
Or a Service Rifle/Assault Carbine/Marksman‚Äôs Carbine 
---
But they probably wont add it because they were jealous of New Vegas‚Äôs Success
---
You can carry a non-auto handmade on a rifleman and, if you don't mind clicking really fast, only be about 10%-15% behind a similarly built commando against bosses. The lever action is terrible for sustained damage per second (the bloodied gauss too to a lesser extent), it's only useful against things it can kill in one shot.
---
For that build I think if it were me, I would take starched genes to get the speed demon mutation to help with reloads, plus a rank of class freak. Pair it with carnivore or herbivore and food is not a problem. Depending on what you're carrying you might also be better off with traveling pharmacy than bear arms.
---
Me too! I've never headed to the exit. Just check corpses for loot and waited to teleport.
---
I saw this video and I read something in a post but I can't find it anymore ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm not sure if it's the truth but I'm prepared üòÅ
---
 https://youtu.be/zOdFvSHzR_Y
---
Bc that rolling pin is easy scrip for low level players.
---
I spent my script server hopping and buying vault steel. does not matter it is not on sale, now I have most pieces of the strangler heart armor.
---
But the RNG gods must love me as i picked up another instigating explosive hunting rifle during an event today.
---
Oh that's just a couple of typos:
---
Can't be placed on water: Object has a restraining order and can't legally be close to water.
---
Lacks support: Object is too depressed to work properly and requieres psychological assistance.
---
Object is floating: Object smoked a couple of joints and it's too high to stay put.
---
Pawn shop?  Scrip?   I‚Äôve only been playing for a little bit and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve run across this
---
It's more to keep the engine stable. The barbell benches were a usable object in FO4. They probably still are in FO76 but I never checked and it doesn't really matter.
---
The problem is the way the engine handles game objects you can interact with. 
---
All usable objects consist of precombined meshes. For objects that would change the way they look after they've been looted those precombined meshes would have to be disabled and replaced with different ones. For the entire map. 
---
It basically means that all those areas would behave as if they are in camp areas. All the trees and rocks the engine "bulldozes" when you build your camp? Disabled precombined meshes.
---
Ever been to a budget glitched camp and experienced the massive lag? That's how it would feel all the time.
---
It's an expansion of the FO4 settlement system and the only difference is that the occlusion culling in FO76 is handled slightly better.
---
If you mean like Tadpole scout, no. Kind of a sleek look but I don't think it was a stealth suit. Honestly it happened so fast and I was still pumped from the mission. Maybe level 40ish. Think it was you?
---
Run this religiously for my carnivore dude. Was doing it on my private, ran in to start collecting and watched the food cannisters disappear. Loaded out and back in, same character, only to watch the cannisters disappear before I could grab one. Loaded in a diff. character, all the cannisters stayed.... Buggy gameüëç
---
Freedom?
---
This. There's like no other current games on hand that limit your **basic currency** not only by daily gains, but also a hard cap.
---
PC!
---
When you really think about how long ten years is, it‚Äôs a very long time for a video game. Had Skyrim only had a 10 year lifespan when it released, it would still be going on today and for another year. 
---
That said, I want an offline single player mode of 76 after the game dies as well. I don‚Äôt even want to think of all of the wasted money I would have put into the atomic shop by then (and now)
---
I would see a weapon like a BE Flamer being useful either as a sort of last resort (I.e., when you‚Äôre near an inconvenient death and need to clear out enemies quickly for breathing room) or as a way of taking a quick chunk of HP out of a boss (I.e., time limit is approaching, everyone‚Äôs got their tags in, and you just want to get it over with already).  The fact that it‚Äôs going to break after a coupe of reloads is just the price you pay for having that ‚Äònuclear‚Äô option available versus dying and/or failing an event.
---
I really do hope the legendary perk system finally drops with patch 22. But [the latest  inside the vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview) made no mention of legendary perks.   It only mentioned the purveyor sale, daily ops and meat week. Which leads me to believe those things are all that we are getting.
---
Or the legendary perk system could be like colossal problem, where it's in the patch but... not in the patch.
---
I mean I'm gonna use it but it's gonna be the last perk card I rank up. default rank is all I want out of it.
---
yea ik, he didnt know the dc mask was rare
---
Junk Jet FTW!
---
Owl Lives Matter ü§©
---
Oh sorry where can I find one of those?
---
Yeah i dont understand why you would cap a currency, wouldnt you want players to be able to spend what they have? Like you basically lose people interacting with your events or anything because you neglect the fact they dont earn anything.
---
gucci1879
---
Ouch, that hurts. Not same but servers have been lagging lately. I was trying to cook food. Motion kept going but couldn‚Äôt get menu to show.  Tried 3 times without luck. Went to an event and poof, the cooking menu showed up in the middle of the event.
---
Damn, I'm on Xbox. I've got a spare fixer plan and some guns that could be helpful but I'm not good enough for the master race üôÉ

I'm hunting for the Forest Camo Jumpsuit so trying to complete as many events as possible so this bugging out is quite annoying

---
DM sent. 
---
The mods don‚Äôt like it when we give out the names of other subreddits, even when it would help keep this sub more organized.
---
Appreciate your generosity!
---
Photomode 2 doors, voila, launch prep. Poor form to jump ahead in a silo someone else has already started, but sometimes you don't have the time to wait..
---
So basically you want to bypass the cost of moving your camp and fast travelling? 
---
What if someone has a camp in one of your slots. Do you take up what would otherwise be a free slot because you logged in first? Would that not make camp placement even harder than it already is?
---
Biv E. Ridge. From the Nukashine speakeasy. Under Big Al's Tatoo Parlor.
---
i mean i completed the motherload some time ago
---
Yeah, it sux. It also trembles/shakes if I am in PA, pretty annoying.
---
I‚Äôve played Rifleman since starting my character, but have all the necessary perk cards ready to switch over to Commando once One Wasteland drops.  Just need to convert my Furious FFR FR Handmade and Instigating Fixer over to automatic receivers and I should be good to go.
---
I'd be okay with the SS jetpack taking fusion cores
---
One thing I've noticed is that everybody seems to be selling more weapons and armor, which would make sense. Now is the time to shop player vendors.
---
I've often thought this.
---
Fallout 4 and the beautiful foggy realms of far harbour   we will always be able to visit. 
---
But when the last server of 76 goes down,  we'll never be able to pace the empty streets of watoga again or admire the sunset from the top of the world.
---
We won't know until it happens since you can't play NW on the PTS
---
Unfortunate. There should be one
---
Lol I wouldn't worry, his argument is basically saying "don't raise awareness for aides because that's promoting it"
---
There‚Äôs a guy in the basement that can only make handmade and super sledge skins.
---
He tried doing something for the Grognak axe twice, and broke the weapon both times.
---
He‚Äôs back on handmade and super sledge duty.
---
I doubt it since none of your other perk cards work in nw
---
Wait the game is just gonna stop and shut down after ten years?
---
i think the main thing you would miss out on having the online server is the bug/glitch creation engine thats hard coded in to the server
---
Yea but I don't think they should. Plus other guns do the same.
---
Don't forget people having to suddenly close up their vending machines because else their gains just vanish into the Void.
---
Yea i can agree with that
---
Yeah, was just about to kill Earle when the server crashed.
---
Confirmed. Heard my Xbox getting ready to explode if I didn‚Äôt leave.
---
This or have a friend enter the silo.
---
Are you on right now?
---
hopefully enemys will not spawn in camps anymore
---
I got blodied explosive 15 reload lmg
---
Wondering if they apply to NW special stats when equipped.
---
This guy is the best guy there. I love you for not forgetting this post &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Yea,and the worst thing is that its supposed to be a crowd controllig weapon.
---
I logged onto get some gold and scrip then leave.  Once in I thought I'd play for a bit and was in the mood to do some events.  Then rolled 3 trash high weight weapons and though screw this.  Logged off.
---
Also saved slots for workshops, blueprints just don't cut it when trying to set up a workshop repeatedly.
---
I would like to see .223 and the needler gun from Fallout. Plus the Chinese Pistol from Fallout 3.
---
This one has far more value for me than the Crit cards.  I can always use more AP to keep VATS rolling.  The only time I usually find a need for a critical hit is on bosses/bullet sponge enemies, and in that case I may pull in some 4-Leaf Clover cards beforehand.
---
I have seen them for 5K! Outrageous.  Got mine at Pleasant Valley and now Commander Deguerra is wearing it with the Sheepsquatch helmet. Looks fabulous üòéüòç
---
No problem dude, thanks for the gold
---
I can only assume that a ghoul managed to teleport in with you and attacked the bots. The server decided it's best to replace the "faulty" batch with a good one once the ghoul was dead. You can sometimes see blood in the shopping area but you rarely see a corpse and since robots don't bleed it was most likely a ghoul.
---
That also happens in West Tek with the mutant hounds or down in Watoga with the bots. 
---
In West Tek it happens when a Scorched Officer is nearby and manages to off a hound.
---
I often arrive there and all the hounds are either lying dead on the ground already or they die the moment I enter the interior cell.
---
In Watoga it happens when a Scorched or one of the other random spawns manages to take down one of the bots patrolling the perimeter.
---
I guess this happens all over the map but we only ever really see it in locations with different enemy factions.
---
My god-tier dream weapon, right now.  10,000 seems to be quite reasonable for that, as well.
---
Lost in the range of 350,000 caps worth of unyeilding armor ( every piece I wasn't currently wearing) doing this. Still transfer every morning, but always wait for a friend to at least hold the server, if not the item. Sorry for your loss.
---
This is precisely why I am playing modded fallout 4 in my free time instead of 76.
---
 I use better crits for boss fights and good with salt if just farming.
---
It's not really much of an opinion, just a reality for online games. When so much of the community already complains about the game being too easy in all respects, and then there are others who cheat with hacked or exploited gear to make things even easier, removing more difficulty from the game isn't a good choice for them and they won't ever do it
---
Uh, they made the lighting look gross when wastelanders launched but other then that idt there's been a recent change
---
So the build height is determined by whatever the highest structure is in that build area (within reason). I have my camp by the acid/lead cave in the south part of the map and i can stack stairs 8 stories high there. Basically from the ground to the stop of the rock archway. An elevator would be phenomenal there
---
The limits all severely hinder the game for sure. I remember when I first started and saw my stash had a limit and that alone pissed m off lol. And then I realized at one point that limit was 200 and then 400. That's appalling lol. 800 still isn't enough in my opinion and I despise having a mule but I finally had to make one just to stop myself from losing my mind. I know I'm not the only person who loves to collect and that limit alone almost made me consider not playing when I was in the early stages. Limits here, limits there, limits everywhere!
---
Bethesda caters almost exclusively to the PvE community now. I miss the old days where both communities got what they needed, for the most part.
---
I ran into a father and team a awhile back and they were gr8.
---
I do not understand the bethesda damage algorithm at all. They tried to explain. 
---
  I am 120 with high ultracite power armor and high armor underneath but I get Radworms from a charred ghoul as soon as I look at one...maybe not that fast.
---
  It can kill me in a few swipes and when I spawn I have zero damage to armor.
---
This would be such a massive improvement, imagine having a backup camp if your normal place was taken in a server!
---
Get rid of hacked and magic gear then. Don't destroy everything else, that will just make people use illegitimate means to get the dps they're used to. You can't switch up damage models like 2 years into a game when people have spent months trading for stuff, only to be kicked in the nuts and have all that fun and dps taken away. It ruins the fun and all the time spent trying to get better stuff. Now my OP melee that I spent months trying to get does like a few hundred more damage than a crafted bat. That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen
---
They have to remove it at one point.
---
According to Angry Turtles latest video, AA is one of the legendary types which suffers least from the nerf. Bloodied is still good for damage, but AA is not far behind while Junkies falls slightly behind AA. Vampires might also be good if you don't want to use stims since you aren't missing out on as much damage anymore either. Explosive is still really strong, but needs the fully ranked demo expert to shine, so AAE is better than AA if you have one. TSE is actually super effective against mobs as well, but far less effective on bosses than bloodied/AA.
---
I want more Flatwood Monster encounters. Like hoards of them. And a secret base where they operate out from.

Because Earle is a glitchy mess that not all players can kill without a decent team, and many teams don't know what the hell they are doing? And then you get close to killing him and he goes into he ceiling or through the floor, vanishing? Or his body disappearing after he dies? I stopped going to ACP unless it's real high levels and even they can't handle it sometimes and I'm running around using all my stims on everyone else until time depletes. Earle isn't a good example imo lol
---
Doubt it. I dont mean the literal gun runners. Just same idea. A ton of new guns come in
---
Read the book too, fascinating occurrences,  America's paranormal central!!
---
don‚Äôt forget the survivalist rifle and the brush gun/medicine stick and also NEW MELEE PLEASE
---
You gotta be on console or something, it‚Äôs not uncommon to run 2-3 ez earles in under an hour playing exclusively with randoms on public PC servers these days
---
Do I smell a commie:/
---
Vault steel isn't limited in how much you can buy.  Just server hop.  The only limit is how much scrip you can get a hold of.
---
Glitches, cheats ect
---
For lead you can hit Charleston fire station for 70-80 lead and all 3 silos have their own gyms with about 60-70 lead =] hope this helps
---
You read that in a mean tone inside you'r head dude because you see you'r self as a a good guy and the other guy as a bad guy to you.Now stop crying that some one proved you wrong.
---
Bethesda would need to fix their damage formulas first, including but not limited to rebalancing. Not this make everything a bullet sponge nonsense that is coming up. Commando is king for long range, rifleman should be up there as well...but it's not. Let us say they add the 1911, would it be actually viable in endgame with the way pistols work in 76? 
---
I would love new weapons! Hell new mods for existing weapons. Iam tired of looking at the toothpick(revolutionary sword) they call a sword in this game, an option to change the blade to a cavalry sabre. They could make a killing releasing atom shop skins for more weapons, engraved revolvers, charms a la COD for your weapons, sheaths/scabbards for your weapons when they are put away.
---
Yes, this. Saves six slots in silos.
---
Also, VATS using fusion power *as well* as AP is straight up bullshit and I hope whoever thought of that steps on a lego every day for a month.
---
KayPOWXD, I would  :-)
---
Very doubtful, there have been loads of XP glitches since the start of the game.
---
Ugh.  That sucks
---
So should be an easy ban then or? He is still playing active tho, that's why I am wondering.
---
God yes, it's annoying that just playing the game and doing events gets you legendaries faster than you can even turn them in.
---
Smoother performance at the trade of of 20x more greifing, people who can 1 tap the queen and much more dupes.
---
Your argument just seems to be that you disagree with my point and therefore it shouldn't happen, but you fail to consider everybody else who disagrees with you. This is not fallout 5, this is a casual online game. Everything you ask for or complain about will affect everybody else who plays the game. And you're hardly speaking for all of them.
---
This must be your first MMO/lite, since this isn't that rare. Warframe just had its 3rd or so major damage overhaul not too long ago, and that game's been around much longer than 2 years. Hell, many other games like this just have server wipes every few months. Everything you worked for, completely gone forever. This game is generous, bloodied stealth commando has been the dominant meta for well over a year without any changes. 
---
They should have gotten rid of hacked items a long time ago. They should have fixed damage overflow and all the other damage bugs a long time ago. That doesn't invalidate any other balance decisions they make. If people are looking for godlike stats and need to cheat to have fun, they shouldn't be playing this game anyway. Fallout 4 lets you do that without forcing everybody else to play like you. 
---
Trading in an online game is always a risk. You pay for meta knowing it may one day not be meta. Being an uneducated consumer is on you.
---
Also lol, "a few hundred more damage" as if that's somehow a bad thing
---
Heh, read my mind. Cant do pts so have to test tankiness similarly at west tek, aka no stealth or vats
---
I absolutely massacre those places on private server
---
Which town is that?
---
XP glitch, but it's not serious enough to warrant a ban :-)
---
Great for PC, PC isn't the only people who are members of the community though lol just because it works on pc servers doesn't mean It works everywhere else. I always try to tank the wendigos and heal people when they go down and somehow most of the time the event still gets wasted.
---
In reality power armor should make you almost invulnerable to everything in the Wasteland.
---
You lable it with small letters, or neon letters, whatever floats your prydwen, at leas then you aren't going to lose it, it is 100% sellers fault if he puts something cherished up for sale if he never intended to sell it.

Got a laugh out of me so I'm down for a violin crossbow

Grafton pawn shop contains a semi-scrapped quest that‚Äôs important to wastelanders. It‚Äôs something you should really only consider doing at around level thirty, after the patch drops on Tuesday. It also has no reward, so it isn‚Äôt worth doing unless [spoiler], and gives the holotape mentioned in this post, which currently cannot be stored. Also, half of the items need to be found with a guide online since there is no in game hint suggesting their location.
---
Scrip is used with the purveyor at the Rusty Pick to buy legendary weapons, modules and vault steel (the second two are components for certain craft able legendary gear). 100 is needed to roll a three star weapon, which is the amount rewarded for turning in all 14 overseer tapes.

I finally got the kid to sleep at 10 PST last night, and sat down to play around. Blast zone popped up near me and I ventured in to get the achievement. Then realized I had never actually tried the colossus challenge. So I go in and am waaaayyy underpowered. Had fun shooting around and died a lot. By the time I'm racing to exit the cavern, my kid wakes up crying. So I just left the game on and went to check on him. When I came back 20 mins later I was still dead, floating outside the mine.
---
Unarmed/melee has been hit the hardest as it relies on a  lot of perk/buff stacking
---
Probably just pick up lvl 1, it still way less hassle than equiping 3 lockpick/hacking perks.
---
And remove 2 of the .44's
---
No more hitting for 3000 put it that way :-)
---
Well, it does have an innate 42% damage and rad resistance with a full suit.
---
Mules is the dark path, leading to the evil inventory management:/
---
It‚Äôs the rad aura of glowing ones doing that. Which is scorchbeast guano.
---
Hard to say, but a 1gb PC update translates to 8 or 9 on consoles, so that's also a factor
---
it is entirely possible that someone could be this level. if they've been running around with like 30+ INT and boosters and playing several hours a day since launch. I put in some serious hours during 5 months lockdown and barely used boosters. Had low INT. And a lot of time was me just dicking around in game (150 hours in 5 months looking for a red asylum) and i managed to get 3 alts to 50 and my main gained about 250.
---
Fallout 4 had welcome mats to change your ft spot dosh 76 have them too?

it‚Äôs smaller than Wastelanders in size but not scope.

An issue I have is that they nerfed some of the hardcore survival aspects and watered it down so much that the game loses its flavor of a "survival game."
---
It's also annoying to see other people whine about something (PvP) that has been here (albeit flawed) since the game's inception. Yes, by all means, balance PvP. Nothing about PvP is perfect, however, that doesn't mean yeet it to hell and have the game lose its core survival aspects.
---
I'm definitely not opposed to different servers for this, if that's what it comes down to. But I'm tired of people saying that Nuclear Winter is the only place where PvP should exist. When we got the game, we didn't come here to only play PvP in a lacking, underdeveloped "Battle Royale." We were promised so much more, only to have it snatched away from us because of foodbuilds who whine too much on reddit.
---
It just increases the durability drops have so it usually venders for more caps.
---
No, the camp slots are personal. It just saves your camp's layout and it's location so that you don't have to demolish your camp if you ever decide to build another one.
---
Example 
---
Your old CAMP is located at The MIRE 
---
Your new CAMP is located at The Forest
---
You're getting bored of your old CAMP, so you open a menu, and Activate the second CAMP that you previously built or are in process of building, the other CAMP is then deactivated but it's location and layout is saved so when you want to use your old camp again, it's right there just as you left it.
---
While Deactivated, someone else can build his/her CAMP at the same location, and then I guess you wouldn't be able to activate yours, you'd get an error message that someone else has their camp built there already, but as soon as that person logs out, you can activate your saved camp again and it would be there just as you left it again.
---
The stash limit is a joke and the server been the cause is a out right lie. So I can have 8000  different items if they weigh  0.1 like most outfits but if I have 100 heavy weapons im full and you can't increase the limit bullshit.  I play relentlessly and always at max everything with in seconds of logging in. There is no fun it it any more all the time gating need to go. Seriously.
---
Basically, yeah.
---
If all power armor could have a bit more carry weight that‚Äôd be so much more helpful than having to find the calibrated shocks plan. Imo all power armor should have a carry weight  of +50 but the Excavator is still the only one with +100
---
Nah, it's nothing major. Idk if you have played back then but at christmas 2019 cheaters were able to wipe your entire inventory...including the pip-boy
---
NW is a steaming pile of shit on PC with all the cheaters, so nobody plays it, plus no PTS version to test :-)
---
"Poison" damage even more so.  I could forgive them for mixing up 'poison' with 'venom', but neither of those covers that weird shit that Mirelurk Kings shout at you, and you don't even need Power Armor to protect against poison, you just need to *not eat the poisonous thing*.
---
Lol
---
Most Pointless post of the year award.....
---
world wide web?
---
I'd rather bank on the game going on indefinitely, I guess until they start to lose money. But by then, perhaps there will be another type of Fallout MMO, so
---
I was expecting a 10 paragraph rant
---
Sounds like shit compared to my baby https://imgur.com/gallery/mYHKxCF
---
Apparently an infinite fallout 1st stash doesn‚Äôt affect servers but a slightly higher stash space will...thanks Bethesda
---
I died once outside the mine bc I couldn‚Äôt get my PA on quick enough and my loot dropped.  Fast traveled to the train station, suited up, and ran in.  Maybe took a few minutes at the most.  My bag was gone...
---
Yeah this is totally possible without being banned. It could be their only character, and with all of the buffs available in game it‚Äôs doable without cheating
---
So the shaft was too much for you?
---
thx for info
---
I just moved my camp to the Mire and it's a good location with a junk extractor and enough water for 5 industrial purifiers, but freaking Radtoads spawn there and sometimes run wild. I set up three laser turrets and they usually keep them at bay, but not always. It would be nice if they didn't spawn there anymore.
---
Even beyond that it sells itself. Many times I want to build a certain aesthetic but I‚Äôm so apprehensive because I love my current build. If I start down this new path and don‚Äôt enjoy what I‚Äôve done, now I have to rebuild from scratch and memory.
---
I want different CAMP styles to match the different feel to parts of Appalachia.
---
Whitesprings, Westek and...  I got nothin
---
Wavy Willards?!!
---
Lol! Do you even know what you are talking about?  Nobody past a curtain lvl really consumes more than a few stimpaks and ammo will soon be abundance by the hand of Beth.
---
No, not THAT gun.  *That* [gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/That_Gun).
---
It is a lot of shaft.
---
In kind of wondering what the third w is, since you don't find legendaries in watoga anymore. Honestly, it's been bone dry since meat week.
---
Almost certainly the case with newer/less experienced players.. At this point, I'm just selling my good/epic rolls for a bargain because I've accumulated enough and don't need the caps. I get satisfaction making someone's day with a crazy deal.
---
Yes I it keeps making me want to change my build but I‚Äôm waiting to see if explosions gets nerfed because I‚Äôm an exploding shotgun guy all kinds
---
Yea hence why I'm shifting towards ranged now. :(
---
It's the base of it that does the damage.
---
Will miss the good old days...
---
All I got was garbage.  Will still be taking out the garbage over the next 4 days due to the scrip cap lol
---
Or fixed or as Jim jefferies would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been down graded‚Äù
---
Honestly, I'd rather this method then the raids. The highest difficulties sucked if you didn't wall breach. And the raids were hella buggy.
---
Definitely a horrible grind though.
---
good idea (for fallout 2nd, 17,99 a month)
---
Once I realized the silos all had gyms bro I was all over them üòÇüòÇ
---
For the first time in I have more treasury notes then I know what to do with but it sucks that I can only trade in 20 a day it's really pissing me off that I have enough to get what I want but still have to wait till next weekend cause I can't trade it all in this weekend
---
Cold 45 and two zigzags...
---
Nope.  Did it just the other week.  Not sure about glassed cavern tho.
---
spoiler: no bethesda content ever comes out when they promise
---
I was scrounging for supplies back then
---
Zzzz i started playing a month ago and I have a full set. They should buff it and make it harder to get
---
So you become the person from Minecraft =)
---
That would be nice üòç
---
This is a really sick base, thanks for sharing
---
3 into agility for dodgy. You could take 3 out of intelligence and put it into luck for luck of the draw, no need for lower gun wear and tear when it repairs itself ;) this would free up 2 more skill points from int for starched genes and you can get speed demon and marsupial, game changers. Would recommend dropping lone wanderer to 2 which frees up another 2 for you to put into class freak, you could take them from endurance too and drop fireproof to 1
---
I never wanted any help when I walked out of the vault the first day or the second, never. In fact I would tell them to get lost. This game is so easy I would get pissed at anyone trying to ruin every bit of challenge this game has to offer.
---
Hey there! No problem my dear friend! For a small monthly payment of 9,99 you can enjoy holding more stuff!
---
What are you, poor?
---
Do you have a vid or pic from your camp and the location? üòÅ I love camp builds
---
Yes I want now
---
Thank you very much üòÅ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Good point. Not sure why CAMPs dont take advantage of the same spawn point rugs you can place at a captured workshop to travel to that exact spot and not somewhere random
---
Was that the punch bowl glitch
---
Me too
---
FYI, there's no vault steel daily limit. You just server hop and it refills. You're only limited by how much scrip you have.
---
No, you get them right away.  I have a lvl 7 with all slots unlocked
---
Sq staff is probably the most badass melee weapon next to a stealth combat knife
---
Maybe that was their plan make a game so shit that you have to mod it fallout 76 would be a moders paradise (not saying the whole game is shitty but there's a lot of shitty aspects)
---
Happened to me the other day, bunch of bullshit.  If someone is actively falling down the same mine shaft maybe deploy the rocks after they land.  Got to spawn in the rad zone in regular armor and whoever launched centered the nuke on the mine.  Slammed radaway and stims and hoped for the best while getting in my PA.
---
How about a skin for the handmade that actually fits in and doesn't clip through your hand
---
Everytime I go down there it‚Äôs an odd random event.  Today there were two dead ‚Äúbullys‚Äù laying on the ground.  Whenever I find the trader, it‚Äôs just all the plans for bows
---
Unless they switch up how events work in their entirety, then I don‚Äôt really see this switching up anytime soon. You spawn into an event, you participate in it, if you die it makes sense to respawn where the event is.
---
They added 45 in honest heart dlc, it‚Äôs was op as I remember because I would one shoot npc and and I wasn‚Äôt a pistol build.
---
Molalla, OR
---
Watoga med
---
"The majority of players want nothing to do with PvP."
---
Where are you getting these numbers? A lot of the PvP community isn't on reddit. This place isn't the end all be all in terms of player base.
---
And even if the PvP community is as small as you claim it is, why not balance things and give both communities what they want? It is possible to reach a compromise and give both the PvE and PvP communities what they want. If PvE was the minority, y'all would be kicking and screaming for the devs to give y'all the non-PvP content you want.
---
I believe it is a Rose quest.
---
Fuck, they took away the watoga medical spawn?
---
What level are you ?
---
Can you scrap the cards from all characters or is it separate for each?
---
I would gladly give your stuff a new life :) if i can't use the stuff i will find someone else that can use it and give it for free to them
---
Major pubes is an amazing screen name
---
Let me log back on and I'll take some pics and maybe do a walkthrough!
---
I'll give you my debts /s
---
Back during launch you could disarm grenade bouquets or other stuff and continue to get xp. So I know a lot of ppl did this until they got up in the high numbers
---
And I‚Äôm 310 and took a 6 month break last year but played everyday other then that break
---
Still a rifle, the only conversion it has is the auto barrel makes it use commando perks
---
BE flamers aren‚Äôt even good against bosses
---
Pretty sure it's just a reskinned and slightly changed refreshing beverage. No addiction chance
---
The idea is to feed the devs enough money that they enjoy making the game last look at WOW and other online mmo type games they live on cus we indirectly pay the employees when we buy merchandise this is how we help them help the community
---
i find that one less times than i find the good trader tbh
---
Rip power fist. The new nerf wrecked it lol.
---
These limits are intentional to keep the game going. Dozens of threads every day bitching about them and they all go straight into the void. Bethesda doesn't care that you don't like it, it's there to serve their purposes and will continue doing so until the game dies
---
Might be better to change your rifle build directly into commando, since your special requirements overlap.
---
Moving to heavy means moving special points, which tbh you're probably better off doing on a new character, especially with legendary perks coming.
---
This is the price you pay for exploiting the game.
---
Why would I play NW when COD Warzone is free? Why would I do Hunter v Hunted when there is literally no rewards for doing so? I can agree with you there.
---
However, those things were added as an attempt to give people an outlet for PvP albeit, very lazily done. The problem with PvP in this game is that ever since slap damage, the removal of Survival mode, and the ever present Godmode bug from legacies, people have been leaving FO76 for other PvP options. 
---
The problem with PvP is that Bethesda blatantly ignored the one end-game activity that people wanted to grind for. If this game is supposed to be a ‚ÄúForever Game‚Äù as Pete Hines said, then getting rid of PvP was terrible idea. When I think about how robust this game could be, I think of what ESO is like in terms of PvE and PvP end-game content. They feed each other and create a loop of content where the rewards help you in the opposite activity.
---
I have over 1300 hours on PS4 alone and everyday there was groups PvPing at Whitespring, workshops and everywhere in between. The reason your experience feels this way is because Bethesda intentionally made budget cuts around PvP as a way to save development money. Instead of making a more robust game with variety in gameplay, we are heading down the road of having a post-apocalyptic Neo Pets game. For crying out loud, this franchise is Bethesda‚Äôs legacy. PvP is in the lore and not expanding on it with the Wastelanders narrative is an extremely huge, missed opportunity to bring players back and expand on the activities in-game.
---
I remember seeing Pete Hines say ‚ÄúWe were surprised at how many people didn‚Äôt want PvP.‚Äù Yeah no shit because everyone doing PvP wasn‚Äôt complaining on Reddit‚Äôs feedback loop. When I heard that statement, it became pretty clear that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt play their own game or understand their player base whatsoever.
---
10mm is .45 on steroids so if anything it'd do less damage
---
The WWW is at it again with more viruses
---
Nah, they could just go up to you and yeet your inventory out of the game. good times
---
Come and take my workshop. It's full of resources and there's a zero chance I'll murder you.
---
time gating is not content. just pointing out it's a scummy way to extend a game's life and shows how (in)competent the developers behind it are.
---
If you read my comments there is no mention of what I want.  I just state what I see, you generalize my play style based on your own presumptions.  And if you don‚Äôt see the majority of players, youtubers, redit posts talk about pve, not pvp your not looking very hard.  Only a very small amount of content or posts are devoted to pvp.  
---
As I stated it‚Äôs not about changing the game with pvp changes it‚Äôs about getting the majority of players involved in wanting the pvp.  Go into any random server and what will you find?  Mostly the entire server farming or doing pve events.   Very few if any are engaging in pvp.  
---
So think of it like your Beth.  Who would you support more?  Who would get the majority of updates?  Prob the majority of players.
---
Like in Dune, but I always wonder about No2s
---
Assault rifles are real fun. Great rof. Low recoil. Much like a handmade, but with lower dps.
---
And that reload speed!
---
The mad hunting for XP has also ruined some events. They should had changed the legendary run repeatable from XP to maybe complete events successfully.
---
I do this with workshops. Saves a LOT of time in Berkeley and the big Red Rocket
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever found the good trader down there.  I find that vendor bot near charleston station more than i find a vendor down at lost home.  Are there any other good spawn points foe rare vendors?
---
It‚Äôs not exploiting if you genuinely think it is a feature of the game.
---
I'm not complicit. I wasn't aware of the glitch until after.
---
Inject that shit straight into my brain folds. 
---
We need more classic weapons.
---
Daily scrip limit is rediculous more people would put time in daily to grind legendaries if they could turn in a bunch instead of getting weighed down after turning in max for the day
---
Gives people other experiences than workshop pvp to be salty about haha. Can you imagine all the reddit posts?
---
You can get rid of the phantom budget. Someone posted a how to guide on here so it takes up a small sliver of budget.
---
I wana know where this info is from what I read b4 launch beth said forever

"Unlike the previous Fallout games,¬†Fallout 76¬†is an online, multiplayer-focused game that¬†requires an internet connection. So what happens if Bethesda has to shut off the servers at some point? That's not something Bethesda is thinking about, and least not in its conversations with the public, because the company believes Fallout 76 can¬†last until the sun burns out"
---
I like my bloody 10mm...not usful in every situation. But not terrible either üëçüèª
---
Just have punji's and other traps not do damage unless they're hostile. Honestly doesn't make sense to allow for indirect PVP when direct PVP has been disabled for a long time.
---
Levels above 50 especially 100 are irrelevant anyway, it's all about the best gear and that is mostly bought within trade hubs and for real $$$.
---
Yep my store has been closed since a few weeks after the treasure hunting event.
---
I've been wanting to try better crits for boss fights instead. At boss fights I have a feeling crit bar fills way faster than my button mashing to activate the crits.
---
Why, how will this make the game better for anyone? I want Bethesda to work on fixes of all the bugs, not chase after the whack-a-mole problems.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply bud. That‚Äôs some good info to mull over before Tuesday. I don‚Äôt know anything about the bosses so I appreciate you not spoiling those completely. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd suspect they‚Äôre an enemy that likes to stagger, since that‚Äôs my main weakness with the shredders. Fortunately I have tons of other fire power to fall back on if need be. I‚Äôm excited to try these out.
---
My secret service armour with the effect where you get more resistance the higher your health (dont remember its name) outclassed most of the power armour in the game and it's kind of annoying because I like power armour but i have no use for it
---
Nerf and more nerf, it‚Äôs the only way they figured can keep people staying in the game longer.
---
The thing is, not all of those weapons are only from FNV, and while Bethesda might wish to sweep that game under the rug, it still exists. They can also pull inspiration from Fallout 1/2, which are still (I feel) in line with the spirit of Fallout.    
---
The Desert Eagle, original Plasma Pistol, Bozar, .223 pistol / That Gun, Mauser, G11, M72, and Pancor could all be explained in-universe and I think they'd fit in pretty well with what we have.
---
Lol berry mentats next time you can't find them you won't be disappointed
---
This would be fantastic. Building/designing my camp is my favourite part of this game, if I could build at another location that'd be great
---
No kidding. Good idea.
---
Yeah :-/ I noticed when I first entered the mine it gave me like a 3 second ‚Äúserver not responding, controls disabled‚Äù notification, but after that everything seemed fine. My guess is that it was a fluke and really bad timing, like the server glitched at just the wrong second, because I could still open the social menu and scroll through teams and such
---
I agree. The looting interface needs to be re-worked to include an area around you; not just 1:1 with specific containers.
---
I know. I was making a different kind of joke.
---
Duping everything and anything. Don't forget that feature at launch.
---
All three aren't very good.  Surely there is something else you could play.
---
That's irrelevant to what I said. It will not get changed no matter what you call it
---
Try going into your game data files and deleting FO76 game files and your online backup. Don‚Äôt worry it won‚Äôt delete your game progress. 
---
Sounds like you have a bug on your end.
---
None this week we are between seasons , back on Tuesday
---
It was what the other guy suggested
---
Yeah, sorry, my reddit didn‚Äôt load comments until after I replied.
---
I think you have a hard time understanding humor.
---
I've never bothered looking for another. 
---
I know one can spawn at the camp site the daily photo op sends you to sometimes. BUT you have to run all the way there. Also. Someone who joined my game for this found one at tangara when they left lost home.
---
Only time since wastelanders is this week I found a 3 star super mutant on top of building near verta bird landing
---
Couldn't they disable the ability to set traps in a certain radius of the mat?
---
It's reflected in the condition and from what I've noticed, mods of weapons you pick up. The same trash with mods and 1.5x condition will sell in NPC vendors for more than the equivalent looted by someone with low luck
---
I think he means daily events.
---
Even the lights on Pa contribute to the lag.
---
I must have missed the announcement.  That‚Äôs pretty lame considering the 150 trade in script  ceiling.  I‚Äôve got 30 legendaries and no way to trade em in.  And it looks like I can‚Äôt even earn script either.  What good is the purveyor sale if you can‚Äôt even participate in it.
---
And please make the slots account wide. 
---
Or something like that.   
---
It may mess up balance a little bit, but I'm tired of building a new character only to have to slog through gathering all my plans again, again, again.
---
Herpes?
---
The Gauss mini  scratches him lol. I only know cause I got the damage rewards. I watched a video of a guy with a fixer taking him out in like 5 or 6 shots. He was probably a level 400 something.  Maybe the Gauss shotgun? Or plasma mini?
---
That isn't a guaranteed legendary anymore. It's always a crowned enemy but rarely a legendary crowned.
---
Fucking sun beams coming out of the ground.
---
No thank you.
---
Nope. Ty though
---
Not much crashing but when I'm in my stash, vendor, etc it gets frustratingly laggy.
---
You need a better gun. Get an anti armour handmade with 25lvc, then you can vats queen in the face from stealth all day.
---
Also: stay in stealth. 2x damage. Shoot the head. Another 2x damage.
---
VFFR RW Minigun
---
JFFR RW .50 Cal MG
---
Ber 33/25 Handmade
---
Mixed results. Prefer doing the event with my vampire PA character.
---
Without sneak head shots, you do 4x less damage. It's the way the game is built.
---
and the original dev team did new Vegas so his point stands
---
I love it I literally have days were I pick up EVERYTHING!
---
BE handmade does 130. B33 does 180
---
Do you mean daily quests or public events?  
---
And if you‚Äôve got 30 legendaries, do you mean you‚Äôve already hit the daily 150 scrip limit?
---
Vampires ffr handmade is what I use. Decent damage and you never die.
---
What gets me is that I have to server hop to get steel. There is no purpose. I don‚Äôt mind the bullion time hate but this hopping is silly. I wanted to make 7 pieces of solar armor, had to hop to 14 different servers.
---
Unless someone is feeling charitable you're not getting a tenderizer plan with what you have. 
---
I got another and it cost me a silly amount of flux. 
---
the deep miner can and chally outfit will probably set you back aboot 5k max
---
I use a bloodied minigun LD/RW and I haven‚Äôt failed one yet. My alt is a Junkie shotgunner and I can make a fair bit of damage with my magic DB shotty. 
---
Teammates help but I‚Äôve done it in a duo. Haven‚Äôt tried to solo it yet.
---
Have been on the market that shall not be mentioned?
---
I can spare one raw fertilizer.....
---
People often forget that the OG Fallout games had modern-Ish weapons
---
For instance:
---
The desert eagle
---
FN FAL
---
H&amp;K CAWS
---
H&amp;K G11
---
H&amp;K P90c
---
Pancor Jackhammer
---
And, if we want to count tactics,
---
The Beretta M92FS.
---
So yeah, a beretta would completely fit lore wise, based on stuff like the P90 and G11 existing in universe already
---
There is going to be Meat Week 2 very soon which should help you with Chally outfit and the tenderizer plan.  As for the mask I have seen it go for about 5000 caps. I am on PC.
---
Daily quests are not popping up for me anymore.
---
I have 30 legendaries that I cannot trade in because I‚Äôm at my daily 150 script cap.  I want to earn more script through my dailies but they are not popping up for me.
---
.... griefing? 1tap the Queen? Haven‚Äôt experienced either in the last 5 months.
---
Joshua Graham‚Äôs A Light Shining In The Darkness is my favorite pistol out of all the Fallout games. It‚Äôs basically the pistol that belongs to Fallout John Wick. Not even kidding, the Way Of The New Canaanite perk teaches you the center axis relock stance, same stance John Wick uses in his movies.
---
(I‚Äôd love it if they added .45 Auto pistols to the game, But they‚Äôd have to add modifications to it so we can make it look like a Colt New Agent like Joshua‚Äôs pistol.)
---
Thing is, I don't need crazy gear and weapons to be good at PvP. This argument of "oh PvP is broken because of hacked and magic weapons" is something used to sweep the issue of actual balance under the rug.

Here you go!

Im down to 6 lol

Gonna scrap wht im not gonna need
---
Go to the market
---
I managed to get a bloody 50.cal and like two the fixer
---
They removed the ghost budget from the ammo machines on the PTS. They also made it so you can no longer place your camp if you have one of those machines present.
---
There's a "method" that was posted in the PTS on the thread about this, but I could never get it to work, nor could anyone I know with the ghost budget. So your best bet is to wait until the new patch and see if it fixes it for you.
---
The 2star BSS shishkebab I got yesterday says otherwise
---
Ok, but HOW refreshing are we talking
---
Stash limit is bullshit. Needs to be at least doubled if not quadruple.
---
Exactly. It's gone too far in favor of the PvE community and has completely screwed the PvP community over.
---
I'm not saying i don't believe you but do you have any kind of like.. evidence?
---
We have MG42‚Äôs and Browning M2‚Äôs already. They‚Äôre in 76.
---
i guess i was saying i don't believe you. Fancy that.
---
Pete hines said 76 would be up for at least as long as he‚Äôs alive. I don‚Äôt think Beth is gonna bring this game down anytime soon
---
Only PC
---
PvP could make the game fun and challenging again.
---
That would be such a good approach to the whole easy to hit limit issues.
---
OP's not even posting to the right market sub xd
---
I use B40RW Gauss Minigun and it does well.
---
It does more baseline damage....but the vicious adds critical hit bonus.  The key to this shotgun is the VATS and critical hits.  If you max out you perks for maximum critical hit and VATS....you will fill up your critical meter in 4-6 shots.  With the other shotgunner and skeet cards maxed out....your critical is almost 1100 damage. That means in one 8 shot clip you‚Äôre guaranteed a critical hit.  I‚Äôve taken down a level 90 mirelirk queen....2 shots. Level 50 scorchbeast...4 shots when he lands.  Any enemies level 40 and under ...almost always one shot.  I always use VATS and sandbag the critical so that I can deal massive damage for bigger enemies on the first shot.
---
Ive got a chilly outfit and miner mask i could do 10k for
---
How do we know Notch and Todd Howard aren't the same person, have they ever been in a room together?
---
Ah ok.  Yah I‚Äôve seen the vendor at the photo site, unfortunately for me it‚Äôs always the bow plan seller.  Ill try tangara
---
Technically, every gun is rare. 3 stars are rarest, naturally.
---
But is your gun DESIRABLE?
---
Well.... sort of. It‚Äôs basically impossible to die with a gun like that. And it has really good secondary and tiertiary effects. But it will burn through ammo soooooo fast. 
---
I‚Äôd personally go for a V25 or V10 Gatling Laser due to the 1300rd cores you can use, but your gun is pretty good for survival.
---
I use a vampires 50cal for the same reason
---
Trust me, I'm balls deep in that. 3 accounts of my own + 3 of my boyfriend's accounts. We have our stuff on each other's accounts as well. We've had to devote entire nights *just* to sorting. So yeah. Definitely evil.
---
I drop everything. Scrip mostly.
---
Bloodied power attack powerfist plus meat and chems = 10 seconds to kill Earle.
---
Z and C for some fucking reason
---
Nice!  I think I‚Äôm done with the purveyor sale already.  I don‚Äôt have enough stash space, scrip, or cap to get rid of all the junk
---
From what I could find when I first encountered this, it‚Äôs possibly a leftover from a planned questline.  Like, an investigation almost like ‚ÄòEnclave CLUE‚Äô. 
---
But that was all basically educated guesses. I never saw anyone say they found datamined info. 
---
Could have been interesting.
---
I dropped 100 stimpacks, 100 radaway, and 1000 5.56 to a level 25ish player. I was on a level 3. Guy looked at the bag and thumbs down. Probably felt bad taking it, little did he know that my character was a mule with thousands of chems and 250k 5.56......his loss.
---
I hate you and everything you stand for your a monster and thats not rite lol
---
That's a straw.
---
Ding dong Vault-Tec calling
---
It is a known fact that the most succesfull people and companies sometimes have to take certain "risks" in order to achieve things. If they want to make their game big, keep old players coming back for more, and earn new players for a couple of years more,  they should really invest in better servers and increase player amounts per servers, including more enemies. Otherwise we will see this game soon dying and their "game budget" would fall flat dead with it - like a letter with the post...
---
Doubtful. You can design a loot route that is long enough to have the first part of the route recycle. If you really wanted to you could continuously loot the same route over and over again.
---
If you want to go on some leveling runs or just want someone to play with, I'm usually on after 8 PM est.
---
Apparently they are at a bus stop. I have no idea where that is. I've been to tangara like twice.
---
Get an explosive one if you can. The explosive effect also triggers vampire effect, double whammy.
---
Oh that‚Äôs crazy
---
What, hold up... THEY'RE REDUCING OUR STASH SIZE?!
---
I can confirm this as i got 60 vault steel yesterday to finish the PA set...but that is 600 script i went through. Use Power patcher perk (check this online?? I think I have this correct) for a material boost only 27 vault steel per part instead of 30.
---
I thought it was only world drops that were bugged. The purveyor pulls from a separate loot pool if im not mistaken. But either way, I've gotten quite a few melees from her and very few have had limb damage.
---
Here‚Äôs my advice for a newer character. Explore all of the forest region and grind there, then go explore the toxic valley and grind there by then you should be level 20 or 25 which means you can go explore the ash heap and grind, by then you should be level 30 you can explore the savage divide but good luck grinding there‚Äôs lots of high level enemies, then you should be level 35 go to the mire and grind, you should be level 40 which means you can finally go to the cranberry bog and grind. I know that sounds like a lot but it‚Äôs not. Oh yeah don‚Äôt forget to pick up quests side quests and dailies and really grind the leader of the pack event it gives legendaries and xp it‚Äôs great for low levels. Also try to start thinking of your build now. Sorry this was an essay.
---
but they were??
---
Damn, I always wanted 400 scrip so I could immediately scrip the 10 Junk 3* weapons I get from Mama Mumbles when turning in 1000 scrip, that way I‚Äôm not over encumbered for 3 days. But I like this idea way better.
---
(That being over encumbered for 3 days 1000 scrip nonsense ended after I made a scrip mule anyways.)
---
I‚Äôd love this. Just camp out in a workshop and kill anyone who comes to do the defense events
---
Write support or something. There is nothing in game you can do about this. Go plead to the customer support, i think, is your only solution.
---
I just hope they remove camp damage altogether.  No reason at all for it IMO
---
Hope i wont experience any if these but I appreciate the heads up
---
That seems to be the case, given how exploitable the game is on PC.  It seems the clients are doing all the heavy lifting, rather than mostly making calls to a server.
---
But people still bought them before? It just feels forced now rather than being able to earn some for a few items here or there.
---
I vote for death sentence, just wiped the account clean for all cheaters, dupers you name it. Only way to teach them a very important lesson in life and make decent people out of them......    I'm not really serious or am I;)
---
Pete Hines says a lot of things...
---
try the search next time, ffs, this has been asked and answered like 10 times today
---
what meat and chems do you use?
---
Sorry for the inconvenience but the main point of the post is to find more people to play with üòä have a good one
---
Tali, you've had too much to drink.
---
Most of these will probably just be atomic shop skins. The Laser RCW probably won‚Äôt even happen.
---
Almost 44 but remember I‚Äôll take ANYTHING my level or not
---
Hahaha
---
Same. I only noticed a rug was floating but everything else is attached to a floor like it should be. Lots of bugged camp items for sure but didnt notice much with this bunker
---
Ok but I‚Äôll be wearing power armor and a Gatling laser
---
I use a quad gauss shotgun for the spawns and a 2 shot ultricite Gatling with ffr
---
Hahahaha
---
Mabye try somewhere else than the two most over fished places and one that doesn't have legos anymore.
---
I‚Äôll definitely try that later.  Yah I think I‚Äôve been there once looking for gold ore when I was very low level and had no resources lol
---
Fallout may never have been a PvP series but my human kill counts in every Fallout game can get ridiculously high.
---
Ok my username is gargoyale
---
Fully agreed. A true shame that Bethesda decided to cater to the whiney foodbuilds.
---
Strangler isn't even worth the grind since they nerfed it. The poison damage is negligible at best, better off going for T65.
---
Auto laser pistol, auto pipe pistol, auto gamma gun, auto plasma pistol
---
But yes i agree, we need more.
---
Ok i specifically said dont bring it up
---
I mean you have a point.  Todd could also be Musk.  Or Musk could be Todd who is really Notch.

Who is real and who is fake =)

Welcome to the beauty of the Appalachian Mountain range. 
---
[My real life view of them](https://i.imgur.com/Fvlrk04.jpg)
---
Sorry to waste your 15 seconds.
---
Yeah that is pretty stupid. It seems like they meant to restrict it to 5 per day and forgot to have it not reset per server, but it really should just be unlimited since scrip is already capped. They said in the past with the plan overhaul and the cap stash fixes that they want to minimize server hopping
---
Even worse.
---
200% refreshing
---
Eh whats your username so I can add you back
---
Season 1 is over. Next Tuesday is start of season 2.
---
The last season ended last week and then the next one starts Tuesday. There‚Äôs a week off in between for some reason.
---
B2525 fixer.
---
The higher damage the better. You may be surprised at how well a Gatling gun does.
---
Damage formulas. 
---
Earl has a ton of % reduction, and a ton of armor. By the time your average gun hits through the % reduction, the damage has been reduced so much it‚Äôs barely tickling his armor. But a big fat 500 damage hit that gets 80% knocked off by his reduction still has 120 damage to hit his armor with. Now, it‚Äôs something like 400 armor, but with an average Armor penetration of around 50%, that becomes 200. 120 vs 200 armor is going to net you about 45 damage per shot.
---
Compare that to a Minigun pushing 110 damage hits. After reduction it‚Äôs at 22. Vs 200 armor that‚Äôs like 4 damage a shot. Sure, it‚Äôs firing way faster, (~10x the fire rate), but it‚Äôs doing 1/10th the damage. So you‚Äôre burning 10x the ammo/durability for roughly the same damage. And losing damage with more frequent reload times (double the capacity but 10x the ammo usage means 5x as many reloads). 
---
Granted I‚Äôm roughly calling these numbers out, but you get the general idea.
---
they added a cattle prod
---
Same as here
---
There is no legendary modules limit. You just have to hop servers after ten.  In your inventory you can collect as many as you want but they weigh .1 lbs a piece. I had 70 at one time when I was trying to take advantage of server rolls.
---
No , it‚Äôs coming on Tuesday 
---
https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1304041162987143172?s=21
---
Id like a retro power fist skin.
---
I remember that. I recall Aten_ra saying it increased instability to have people server hoping.
---
I think the BoS expansion is story
---
Considering none of your normal perks apply in NW, why would they? I‚Äôd almost guarantee there‚Äôs no connection
---
Oh ok
---
It gives to put you at the southern border automatically with a relocated camp machine having some effect on it. I think they were super worried about trap bases and still why we don‚Äôt have fast travel mats. Still wish you could atleast point at what border they spawn at. They also are more likely to spawn towards the vendor units so if they overlook the edge you have a 50 50 chance to spawn at the right level.
---
TIL 
---
This is excellent news
---
Yeah Angry Turtle has just released a video about it. TSE and AAE are looking to be meta relevant post patch. Especially paired with Demolition Expert card (obviously).
---
Oh okay cool, thanks. From what I understand daily and weekly quests are how you get score points for next season, correct?
---
It‚Äôs a great Scorchbeazt weapon for new players. Accurate, hard hitting, ammo efficient and common ammo, does bonus damage to all scorched enemies.
---
Only creature drops are bugged with this purveyor drops are fine
---
Question I run a non stealth Bloodied melee build I usually keep line wanderer rank 3 for its damage reduction (20% right?) Would you say the damage reduction received from empathy, class freak, and strange in numbers while solo is better or worse than max lone wanderer?
---
Its by design. They don't want people to play the game for a few weeks, blow through content, and then stop playing, so they put these caps on. And the amount of time is the really annoying thing. You have to log on every day for over a month just to get the T65 PA.
---
The auto barrel is in the same category as the shotty barrel.  Are you sure it only counts for 1 and not the other than?  I feel like if the shotty conversion doesn't count why would the auto conversion count?
---
You lose sneak critical with explosive you know, and sneak critical is superior to Vats critical FYI.
---
BoS expansion, daily ops, and a whole bunch of other things are being added soon.  
---
Outside of that, I don't mean this in any malicious way, but if you don't enjoy grinding, Fo76 probably isn't the game for you. Bethesda mmos are by design incredibly grindy, and it takes a certain type of person to enjoy that sort of gameplay. I haven't gotten bored with the game because I play with others (anything's fun if you do it with cool people) and enjoy turning my brain off to grind after work. If you don't enjoy grinding, you might want to consider finding a different game to play
---
Ok there is only one monster In this game I even worry about with my x01 power armor. I haven't bothered trying to make the 65 because of the mods and I don't feel like farming all that gold. It's the diseased king mirelurk he has one. Poison damage or something that when it hits you maybe it stacks but I can't heal through it all the time if I just fight him head on. Anyone else have this problem. I have blocked and the flame resist perks.
---
Currently I have the auto conversion, semi auto, charge, and the charge shotty
---
probably vamp magic mini
---
Ha.
---
Well that, some nutcases setting fires, and then the failure on the part of the state for not keeping up with the clearing of underbrush. You also have the eucalyptus trees which so many people started planting back in the 70s in the hopes of striking it rich which have very flammable oil to them. As one of my buddies put it, if 2020 was a state, it would be California, just one bad situation after another.
---
I 100% would buy the game again in an offline mode.
---
Happened on Xbox two nights ago but not today or last night
---
I had to inform my buddies of that. Some said that's BS, others were like...so what are we getting. Gave them a breakdown, mentioned how daily ops works and how the guy for it looks like he is from Metal Gear, etc.
---
Yeah someone in your group launched a nuke. Silly, but that's how that works
---
I run BE and Bffr and can stay in sneak with my BE no problem. Get better damage on Earle with explosions in stealth. Queen is impervious to the explosive though I think.
---
Just the ambient score when walking around is SO amazingly reminiscent of Fallout 1 and 2 (and it was the same in FO4) and I absolutely love it for that.
---
I‚Äôll even go so far as to turn off radios because who wants to hear that when beautiful music is available?
---
I absolutely LOVE this idea. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 2000 hours so far, My first day in 76 was the last day of the first Fasnacht. First day in I set my first camp down behind the Helvetia post office and that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs been 2000 hours and 430 levels later. I‚Äôve seen dozens of amazing camp spots but I never want to move from my spot I‚Äôve been in for 2k hours. 
---
Having 3, or even just 2 camp spots like you mentioned would let me keep my forever camp at Helvetia, and indulge in my inner builder by setting up a second camp elsewhere.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
Sounds like a good idea, yes?
---
From Vault 76, you go to the Wayward. Then to Flatwoods. Make sure you visit the agricultural center to get the Overseers tape.
---
Swing through Sutton and visit the Overseers childhood home. (The overseer is in a different building in Sutton. Hit her up now, or wait until you finish the main game.)
---
Go to Morgantown Airport, then explore Morgantown H.S. and Vault-Tec University. 
---
Now to Grafton. Nothing there really affects the main story, it's basically a side quest area to help level up. You'll unlock several daily quests you can come back to if you ever need more XP.
---
Then, start heading to Charleston. 
---
Also: Get the Charisma perk "Inspirational". (Extra XP when you're on a team) and join a public team. You don't need to quest with them, just be on a team for XP.  Join a "Building" team because the +INT bonus hels you earn more XP.  (You'll also earn caps whenever a teammate completes a quest)
---
I launched last night at alpha and a guy launched bravo before and then someone launched Charlie after me on Xbox
---
I got bored waiting for wastelanders to drop, after the economy crashed from d00ping I started getting  a photo album of all the funny teddy bear poses. 
---
Its all about finding stuff to do, there will be so much of the Mao you haven't properly explored. Go forth and search for the easter eggs.
---
By comparison, this grind is significantly easier than the Vault Raid grind. Just afk meat week and you'll be swimming in treasury notes. Then take a few minutes every day and redeem them. You'll get there before you know it.
---
Level 8?  Depends.  Awkward camping trips with your uncle for starters.  Than the creepy baby sitter.  Usually followed by the aunt who is good looking but a raging alcoholic.
---
I think the dude/dudette is high or drunk? Cuz the post makes no sense whatsoever?? :) What does script have to do with quest or dailies?  :)
---
The thing is, from level 100-300 its quite easy to gain xp, but from 300 to I think 1000, its harder and you get less.  So yeah i get the part people can be around 300-500, but at some point people do get bored if the same grind. So how on earth he manage to get to whopping 2700. Its not like anything we can immagine and compare. I have played so much and I did break too and Im burned out for the second time, and I al level 180. I fully understand you are 310 and others 500+ , but I dont understand close to 3k level.
---
Alternative suggestions for vanguard's?
---
Needed my tenderizer,- got an aa,fss,90% day before sale. Definitely just world drops bugged.
---
Or you heard about it, tried it and are now worried that the ban hammer is coming your way?
---
Is there some circumstance that makes world drops bugged with limb damage I'm not aware of?  I have gotten a ton of swing speed drops recently and if not that, then it's power attack.  Not a melee build at all but I always keep the best swing speed knife I find because stabbing things really fast is fun.
---
I wonder, because I got the 30k cap without even trying, and I was wondering what to do with caps at some point? I bought one serum and have a lot more to go, but is there any end game caps sink somehow or?
---
No idea what the drop rates are, but I got the outfit on my 3rd day of daily ops and I hadn't gotten a rare reward before that for elder tier. The suit and mask are 2 separate drops as well, so it'll take a while to get both.
---
So the youtuber AngryTurtle put out a vid this morning that goes over some of the legendary effect and their damage potential. If you use that as well as other people‚Äôs info/experiences from the PTS the choice (specifically for heavy weapons) comes down to this: do you want to do the most amount of damage possible or do you want to do less damage but be tankier for less investment. 
---
Bloodied builds are the highest (or second highest*) amount of damage you can achieve. The downside is you are less tanky and because bloodied builds require lots of very specific things (perks, armor effects, etc) it takes a lot more time for someone to reach that max damage potential. 
---
The alternative now seems to be Anti-Armor builds. While there are some instances where Junkies builds do slightly more damage its mostly going to come down to the amount of armor an enemy has. With one wasteland maxing out enemy levels for you when it matters (as in not against scorched or wolves) the enemies are going to have enough armor that the damage difference will favor Anti-Armor over junkies. While you will still be doing less damage with an Anti-Armor build compared to a Bloodied build, the barrier for entry is basically non-existent. Anti armor weapons are currently cheap, you can use whatever armor you prefer including a stock Ultracite PA and be a tanky bastard, and you have a bunch of extra special points that you‚Äôre not using on perks required by bloodied that you can use on QoL stuff to make the game more enjoyable for you. 
---
TLDR; it depends on your play style. If you want to min/max damage at an increased cost go with bloodied. If you just want to be able to get through all content without spending a bunch of time and sacrificing other things go Anti-Armor
---
*Per Angry Turtles most recent video it appears Two-Shot/Explosive weapons are now (again?) the highest damage weapons you can get with the caveats that: Earl and the SBQ are immune to explosive damage and he was still in a full bloodied build just with a TS/E weapon instead of a Bloodied weapon
---
Edit: Additional caveat. There is a question regarding magic damage and whether a Junkies/FFR/FR weapon (which is magic) would have a TDO higher than an AA/*magic secondary effect*/FR weapon. Since heavy weapon builds use PA for the perk they will require the weapon to have the magic effect so it‚Äôs possible that specific junkies weapon is better than an AA weapon
---
All of them nyahahahaha
---
That‚Äôs 4 W
---
I think is the camp circumference, besides the circle you have to build, there's another, bigger one, to separate that camp from others, i moved my camp next to my husband's a couple days ago and even trying to have it as close as possible, I'm still kinda far from his, like, there's room for another camp in between with some extra room
---
500 yellowcake? Maybe 300 screws and some other bulked junk on xbox tell me your my hero
---
I read that and the only thing I could think of is when you drink before getting into a conversation in Fallout 4 and your character drunkenly says ‚ÄúConcur...‚Äù when you skip dialogue.
---
No you can't it happens occasionally in a busy server that the numbers don't get updated and it looks like you are doing critical damage. Just jump in a private server and test it out. You will notice you immediately loss sneak critical with explosive.
---
Just a FYI the game is really not designed to be good at 2 weapons.  So you really need to pick pistols or rifle else wise you are going to miss out on a lot of perks that make rifles good.  Also from every post about pistols I have seen on this sub they are not worth it and you are going to have a bad time with them.
---
Now if you don't care then rock your bad self out  and have fun =)
---
Yes thats true but you see the downvoted I have for asking for ban? Thats the problem. Yes, i understand bethesda scamming us with bugged game, but why this community still support exploits? Yes bethesda should fix their game first priority, but doesnt mean that a player should be rewarded for hard exploits. Yes legendary perks scales with xp, enough said.  You wiuld have min maxed those cards if you exploited, literally no need the insane grind. Yes. Give me those cards max level without need to work for it.  Thats what this guy gets as a reward.
---
Executioners LMG +Limb Damage....it‚Äôs absolutely amazing. Earle dies within 7 mins.
---
Try soap when you shower. Maybe a little mouthwash too.
---
If it's any consolation, without watching a video of how to do it the silo part alone is like being a headless chicken running around, even with the markers (They always appear even if it's your 1000th silo) so you haven't missed much.
---
I have a friend who's been playing since day one. He's passionate about fallout to the point of obsession. Usually plays two separate characters simultaneously (Both are Bloodied Commandos with maxed out gear) while nonstop grinding boss fights. He has a disability, so he usually works from home for half the day, then spends the rest of his day playing fallout. Both of his characters are level 2000+ and I've known him since launch, so I can tell you from experience that it is possible to get there without exploits.
---
There's this one level 7 player joined my public team, followed me to Whitespring, fist fight bunch of lvl 65 ghouls, didn't die, just to deliver me a radaway &lt;3 Added the guy on my friend list straight away. That kind of player I wouldn't mind exploring the wasteland together oh and I'm bloodied build.
---
Totally agree... I even posted this:

Vanguard.
---
A low level does that to me I heal all my rads and use the stimpack in front of them and shoot them a thumbs up. Then I wait till they‚Äôre out of sight and refill my rads with toxic goo.
---
(Tis the thought that counts.)
---
So glad I reached 300 recently then. Hope that ammo card is as good as I think it will be
---
Thank you, that was nice info. Its hard to understand, but nice to know, specially if its more or less legit.
---
Correct
---
There was an auto-axe that's been data mined a couple months ago. Looks pretty fun.
---
One fun thing I like to do is play endless survival in whitespring. I go inside, shoot a bot, and have the whole facility attack me. Then I see how long I can last before an assaultron beams my head off. It's all about making your own endgame!
---
I have nothing against grinding, but I don‚Äòt want it for stupid challenges like build x of y in your camp. The RPG character really needs some love.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nah, probably used the godmode glitch. I really wish they'd ban players who did stuff like that the day patch 22 is released. No legendary perks for them!
---
Hell yeah I am. I need a legendary tenderizer. I mean I need a real one so I can put up this trouble shooters for sale.
---
A bit late to the game are you, In a few days it won't matter that much. What will matter is two new legendary Perks that are kinda broken or maybe it's intensionally.
---
Happens at least once or twice every play session for me. It feels like a second chance. Some prince of persia shit. That's what I tell myself any way.
---
Even people on Reddit that do know these things can be pretty defensive of their right to use these weapons.  I posted a thread asking people to stop using these glitch weapons and stop ruining events until Bethesda fixes it and a lot of the replies I got "talk to Bethesda I'll do what I want".  We all know that Bethesda is unreliable and in my opinion the community is actually more reliable.  It's my hope that people will eventually get the message that they're ruining events by using these weapons.  It sucks because it's not their fault that they're loadout became a glitch, but it still doesn't make it any more polite to ruin everybody else's event.  The thing that bugs me is there are a group of people that are well aware of what they're doing and just don't care.
---
Yeap because most of us don't even want it them in the first place.  
---
I can farm 3/4 minimum of every resource in 1 location and it will take me about 20-25 minutes, faster than any workshops produce them a fraction of them, and with no outlay on building costs for the workshop, Ammo falls from the skies if you go after miners and scorched, the only difficult things to get are "full" Fusion cores and Plasma cores, and now I can generally farm 6-11 full Fusion cores in one 2 hour session, and with the ammo perk on I can get 5-6 Plasma cores on the same run.  
---
If they workshops aren't wanted for score, they aren't wanted at all.  
---
I can wait for the commie skins, I just want the green house so I can start throwing stones ;)
---
Dude. I love that spot! Just northeast of berkely springs right? The radtoads give good extra junk and meat to sell. Everytime I come back to camp theyre wreaking havoc, but it doesn't cost too much with the junk extractor right there.love the atmosphere of the mire
---
That's where I thought! I grew up there. My grandma had to ship out along with a ton of high school friends and family who stayed around the town. It's freaking nuts.
---
Are you from there as well or just your friend?
---
Your spawn location for your camp is based on where you move your camp device in the camp, you always spawn kinda north of it. Try moving it around and you‚Äôll see your spawn point change.
---
neither
---
I think level 9 comes next after level 8
---
I really enjoyed the enclave story. Hopefully we are getting more of it in the near future.
---
Not true. You can use as many as you like (up to the max 6 slots). I'm currently using 5 myself.
---
Where did you hear this rumor?
---
This weapon damage calculator should answer the question. Let us  know.
---
Having to build in or take out stuff like camps takes up a lot of server memory. So does having to suddenly scale nearby loot and enemies to a new player's level. And tracking your current quests, inventory, player state, etc. It takes a few minutes after you're in the server (less on a SSD and/or a good PC) for all of that to properly load and set in. If you server hop within 20 seconds, that tends to cause issues
---
False, you have 6 slots and you can use them all at once.
---
This is exactly the sort of attitude that I was referring to when I said some people know about the glitch and just don't care.  We all know Bethesda is not great about patching things and overall as a community we've done a great job of making up for it by being all around responsible players.  But somehow thinking that the money you paid for the game is more valuable than the money anyone else paid for the game is really an example of the problem.  I know I would be bummed if my favorite weapon was causing glitches but I definitely wouldn't keep using it if I knew for a fact it was ruining everyone else's experience.  this is an online game which means you're not the only player and you're not any more important than anyone else.  Try real hard for just a minute to be an adult and take a small inconvenience on to allow others to enjoy the game.  yes it's ultimately bethesda's fault in bethesda's problem but that doesn't mean we have to be inconsiderate of one another.
---
Yeah theres a little bit of control but not much. Its sometimes enough though. Apparently the test servers have had a chem that can be crafted from the vocal sacs that makes you immune from the fear scream for a period of time. Whether it gets into the game or not remains to be seen
---
Marine layer kept the ash and smoke filled air from mixing with air at ground level. That‚Äôs why you could hardly smell any smoke, it was all trapped above us causing the orange colored sky.
---
~~Probably saving it for a huge Mole Miner lore update~~
---
I dont think so.  angry turtle was using his on PTS.  I think they will have a real problem with long time players if they do that.
---
Because the devs copy/pasted most things from fo4 and skimmed the rest. There is currently nothing in the game that can be converted between a shotgun and any other damage types. Rifles and pistols can be converted between semi auto and auto though
---
Thank you very much. Youve been very helpful
---
End game is a joke.  End game is camp and atom shop as well as level 1000+ needed and secret discord server to do the latest exploits.
---
Maybe u/ladydevann could help here, if you give her more information.
---
Dude, you are acting like an entitled asshole. The guy responded with a measured point. Disagree all you want, but, Christ, don't be such a fuck stick about it.
---
I was really impressed with the underground Chinese base aesthetic
---
I mean I‚Äôm on Xbox and I have a video on my feed of me staying in sneak and hitting some criticals with my damage ranging like 300-500 on earles head. I dunno what ‚Äúsneaky critical‚Äù. Can‚Äôt even google that but I‚Äôm in sneak, and doing regular and critical hits very regularly. Javis116 is my tag.
---
Thank you for being mature enough to alter a minor portion of your gameplay to allow others to play.  I hope this gets patched and we can all go back to playing the weapon we like but until then we need more adult people like you who know that ruining the experience for everyone else doesn't do the community any good.
---
Yep.  same thing happened to me a few months ago.  I ended up launching my first nuke a week later.  I was at the purveyor.  I still have the screenshot.
---
Most likely the game just puts you in a default spawn point because the area isn't fully loaded in on your client
---
I to use a suppressed instigating 10m pistol with my lever
---
I hope there‚Äôs a next gen upgrade.
---
Why are you accusing me? It was an honest mistake, the person didn‚Äôt even tell me it was a glitch. I literally thought it was a feature in the game. I‚Äôve asked higher players before to build me stuff because I‚Äôve only been playing this game for a month.
---
Nice. Ty
---
They said they will fix them almost two years ago and they still haven't. It's pretty safe to assume they will remain broken forever
---
I'm not sure if it's just legacy ones but I will certainly agree that it's not all teslas.  I really wish we could narrow down what specific attribute is causing this and then less people would have to alter their play style.  Or God forbid Bethesda just fix a bug they created.  regardless a big thank you to everyone out there that has altered their play in order to let others have fun.
---
Whoever downvoted you is probably jealous they don't have legacys 
---
Take my upvote
---
I think this would encourage people to do a lot more exploring and such on the map too if you can save one spot and try out another.
---
I have a blueprint that contains 2 floors and 2 walls and the lights "communication", just claim a workshop and use the letters to speak
---
I can tell you that the attacker can initiate PvP and deal damage before the server can communicate to the defender that they are in danger.   You can hold down the "build" button anywhere in the workshop to claim it, and the second you hit "yes", the defender's bar goes red and they're usually down inside of a second.
---
I take poorly to getting ambushed in my workshop, and I figured out damn well how to get it back.
---
Yea. Me too.
---
True. We can only hope lol
---
Ty man
---
That's Grahm's brother.
---
Oh my god you help the game so much... NOT! It‚Äôs okay snowflake that some people are using a game mechanic to their advantage. It‚Äôs not like we used outside programs to dupe thousands of legacy items into the game. Not everyone has hours to play each day and farm materials to get a measly amount of ammo. The servers don‚Äôt lag at all and if you have a problem with lag you can pay $15 dollars a month for your own server.
---
The DVs are because you don't even understand what's going on and are asking for bans based on your perception w/o any conclusive fact.
---
eg, this high lvl... I play really a lot, I'm retired after all. I use 2 accounts and have multiple chars over lvl 400. Combined they reach well over lvl 2000.
---
Yeah I don't know why everyone thinks it's the super OP gun. It can one shot trash mobs just like a dozen other BE guns. If we are using heavy guns I would take a b/ffr ultracite gat or gauss mini over an explosive flamer at a queen or EarI any day. I have a bunch of different explosive flamers and it's not really worth it trying to find fuel to kill trash mobs. 
---
I don't even really think durability is the problem. It's lasts about as long as its  200 shot clip and it'll one shot any trash mob. If you have to hit a couple enemies a few time that's like a hundred fifty to two hundred kills per repair kit. That sounds pretty balanced to me.
---
Not quite, if you are interested in the effect AngryTurtle has a great review video you could watch to see it‚Äôs usefulness.
---
For the love of the GODS, YES!
---
It constantly happens to me, too,  
---
It especially happens when i don't have bird bones on my character, Almost like it thinks i'm traveling too fast and the game says no, But this is mere speculation as to why
---
That explains why I see people in the glassed caverns at SBQ events I guess. Mind you, there are enough deposits there to not really need an immortal one.
---
It's not someone's PC it's a problem across all platforms it's just not a consistent problem with all teslas.  No you don't have to alter your playstyle because Bethesda put a bug in the game that breaks it for everyone else when you use a certain weapon.  You don't have to change the way you play to cater to something you didn't cause.  But don't pretend that the problem is because of people's systems not being able to handle it.  It's well documented that this is a bug across multiple platforms under very specific circumstances that we have not completely narrowed down yet but we know is Tesla related.  I'm not going to continue to argue with people who are not mature enough to make a minor change so that others can play.  I will just say that this sort of issue really is a good litmus for the community as far as who is willing to alter their style for the greater good of everyone and who is going to say "not my problem screw everyone else".  the Tesla was one of my favorite weapons and I have completely put it away until this bug gets patched.  Am I happy about that no, is it my fault no.  Do I feel like I am a part of the community if I continue to ruin other people's experience, no.
---
I don't know what it's like on PS4 or PC, by the time you pull up the world map to fast travel somewhere on the XBox you will be dead...  
---
Remember most generic players are foodie builds where quality of life perks, over-ride maximum attack perks, so they are not optimised for PvP.
---
Gauss minigun isn‚Äôt good against bosses either
---
That's exactly where it is! The radtoads aren't usually a big problem, they're more of an annoyance. I may get rid of my defensive wall so that my turrets always have a clean shot at them; as it stands now, sometimes they go behind it and just keep whacking at it and the turrets can't get at them.
---
I stopped playing for a while after the season, but daily ops seems like a pretty fun thing to come back to. Soloing elder is a bit of a challenge with the wrong effects lined up. Although it doesn't take much time, it feels exciting to go through. Also a great way to test weapon versatility. Did my 6th one so far and already trying out different weapons to see how they fare. Story content itself won't keep this game going, they delayed wastelanders by like 7 months and many people got through the whole questline in one day. The only thing you can do to truly stay interested in the game is to enjoy the gameplay loop/grinding or repeatable content like that
---
Can it play "Fire on the Mountain" as you kill folk? Or "Devil Went Down To Georgia"? That would be EPIC.
---
I read the same rumor in another thread here but it was confirmed to be false.
---
I'm aware it's changing from multiplicative to additive, but thinking they still may help.   Which two legendary perks are considered broken?
---
True
---
Lots of good answers here. But I have a strong theory that he takes way more damage from every kind of gun when multiple people are shooting him in the head at the same time.
---
It melts mobs. First I saw it was in  riflegaming video from about a year ago in a top 10. Same roll and everything I  can't use it as it messes up frames/textures to much.
---
" I'M WEARING A HERMETICALLY SEALED TANK"  who says it has a perfect airtight seal?  didnt notice the large gaps in the pwr armor?  even if you assume it has a seal, assumption is most seals are many years old.
---
look at the nasa space suit, the helmet is 100% sealed and locked onto it's torso while pwr armor is not.  finally  HERMETICALLY sealed, you are assuming all diseases are airborne only.  you can easily get a disease from a cut(or a bullet wound).
---
Yep, I'm on the pts and all legacy weapons were erased. Confirmed to go live with patch 22.
---
Sounds like you've finished with F76 then. Time to try something else.
---
I made a post about this exact idea haha, go Bethesda go!
---
Servers are getting hammered right now because people are using the ammo factory exploit. Bet your server had workshops with dozens of them down.
---
Swing speed, limb damage, weightless, and +agi are the four bugged ones. All unarmed and a few melee weapons can only drop from enemies with any combination of those effects. The reason why is missing keywords, but the reason why other sources are safe is because they each use different leveled lists (although many of the newer sources of items are just copy/paste from the purveyor lists, hence why stuff like the dragon and ripper are missing from them all)
---
Silly is the wrong way to describe this. The same thing happened to me and it's absolutely fucking unacceptable. I contacted support about it but they wouldn't revert my quest to being incomplete so I could do it myself.
---
Nope, some of us even got rid of Travel Agent. If you have all plans and recipes, caps become worthless.
---
The plants don‚Äôt shine thru if you have a pair that came before wastelanders. I personally like it tho, that‚Äôs most of the appeal of the armor to me
---
Instead of a circle around the survival tent it should be a small square just as big as the tent itself. There‚Äôs really no need for it to have a build circle when you can‚Äôt even build around your survival tent.
---
I just started playing again and I can't believe I put so many hours into what it was at launch lol.
---
I found a really gorgeous spot in the Mire with a waterfall, so I built my CAMP around it.
---
\[PHOTOS\]([https://imgur.com/gallery/MRaDb2i](https://imgur.com/gallery/MRaDb2i))
---
IIRC if you get Elder rank you have like an 80% chance to get one of the unique rewards. And all of them except the War Glaive plan can be dropped/traded.
---
Going to be completely honest I'm not that thrilled with it and have been considering moving back into my T-51.  It's got a cool look but the rad resist wasn't as good as I hoped and I can't change the look of it.  Glad I did it to at least pick it up though.
---
lol I will upvote too.  I wish I had a legacy...
---
idc, but I do want to see them fixed. I have my own nocturnal explosive gatling plasma I found in 2018 and it's ridiculous how overpowered stuff like that is. I would be fine with broken gear if there was some skill or luck floor to getting them, but it's just cheaters regurgitating the same ones into the economy over and over. Getting tired of seeing one everywhere I go just because they're so laughably broken
---
Good deal. Read it on another thread. Glad to hear its false!
---
Yeah I'm not really agreeing with you on one. I have a primed bloodied faster fire rate Gauss Mini that rips the queen's face apart. I will admit though that with a penta barrel it destroys my flux and isn't worth being used for that reason.
---
As long as i don't get Graham agro'd on my camp I'm good
---
I want more also
---
Did you miss the entire thing where they said "without relying on friends, storage containers or private worlds".
---
It can't be that hard to implement a fucking shared stash. Hell Borderlands 2 of all things had one. Although given Austin's history with this game I'd bet they would screw it up.
---
One of my Fav movies it would be cool to see :)
---
Technically every 3\* is rare for any configuration. Just like rolling a dice 10 times and landing on 5 every time is just a hard as rolling a 2, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 2, 3, 5, 1.  Also, technically the less sought after it is, the more rare it is because everyone just scraps it if it is not sought after. I guarantee you it would be harder to get your hands on a Nocturnal Limb damage DCG that it would be to get your hands on a BSS one.
---
It just works
---
The gauss rifle could use a clandestine skin, to match the other gauss weapons.
---

---
&gt; ‚Äû...after the economy crashed from d00ping...‚Äú
---
So December 2018? :)
---
Yeah, just focus on rifle build and use the pistols for show
---
Never happen.
---
No one looking at the red text when they try to open a door. They run and press open, assuming everything is fine. So yeah , op has a point.
---
Can you have multiple of the same stat? Say two Strength cards? I find it unlikely but heard some people in area chat talking about filling slots with all of one SPECIAL perk.
---
Great Idea. I put a lot of effort into my camps,and have spruced it up with some Atom Shop items. Hate to think it would one day be gone just like that. Would be nice to drop in occasionly just to revist old,familiar territory and do a explore of the world that I've come to know. As long as it was done for all platforms.
---
I bought this game with the expectation of walking into a dangerous wasteland. From every interview and trailer they released, thats one of the things they really drove home. How every player encounter is an intense experience with not knowing how things could play out. I pvped in this game since beta, role-playing a raider the entire time. At first, it was pretty close to everything wanted. What I wanted was more of a hardcore survival experience, raiding peoples bases, taking resources and other things. 
---
I look back on this game and can't help but be disappointed in hows its turned out. Dont get me wrong. I enjoy the PvE aspect of this game and continue to play it despite it not being what I wanted. But it could have just been so much more, so much wasted potential. Im still holding out some hope for private servers and modding. Thats probably the only way I'll ever get what I've wanted out of the game.
---
Really good online games attract the best skilled gamers. That is why they have professional gamers and Twitch streamers that make millions. None of them are playing Fallout 76. Instead, the player base for 76 are the worst and least talented on a technical level. The best NW players are just average Fortnite, Warzone, or Apex players. When you see people on this reddit saying they don't want PVP, that is why. Alpha players are playing better games.
---
No because its harder to get xp after level 300.  Also i dont know why you defend players either, you say you ask for ban for not knowing. No i did not, I asked it to be checked! Looked into. If they legit, nothing to worry about either.
---
I agree 100%.  I think about this every time I get into PA.  ‚ÄúWhy can I carry more outside of my fusion core powered metal suit?‚Äù
---
So are you intentionally ignoring that word balance? Ffs
---
Getting the achievement is separate from completing the questline on your own.
---
You can still do everything yourself including launching a nuke.
---
Did you get any good plans?
---
So end game is high xp and atom shop. Got it
---
No, but there are 4 ranks and it wouldn‚Äôt be efficient cause u could have over 15 strength perk but u can‚Äôt equip more than 15 strength points worth of cards
---
Good idea
---
150 days after the release of wastelanders we get posts complaining about a ‚Äûgrind‚Äú that would take 35 days to complete. Woah.
---
You just lied.
---
I disagree. I run a build on my main that is good with Heavy Weapons and Shotguns both, as well as Melee. While it requires the occasional swap-out if perks, it‚Äôs definitely doable.
---
I do agree that since Pistols and Rifles use a different Primary stat, that‚Äôs more challenging.
---
They already technically did pull inspiration from F01, the plasma caster is the original model for the Plasma rifle.
---
Stone bench ::)
---
No, being exposed to rads with the perk heals your hp but your max hp still decreases, quite rapidly so in a nuke zone.
---
Wait, you guys get to respawn?
---
Lol!
---
The limits turn hours of my game time from running around doing fun stuff with other players to sitting in my camp debating what to throw out or walking across the map in slow motion overburdened with garbage legendaries. Makes the game boring and worse for the community.
---
Somehow I've still never been there.
---
That would be so incredible.  You could also more easily move your camp to farm whatever scrap you needed most at the time.  Wish this was a thing.
---
It's a very good perk if you don't have a bunch of AP Refresh on your armor.
---
I would love this but wouldn't work, to move entire camp while in a live game would take a lot of server power from other services. Personally I say keep the same concept but make it so you can choose what camp slot you want to load with like how characters work, basically want to use a different camp then head on to character/camp and pick your character and your camp slot so it doesn't delay starting the game.
---
That‚Äôs too much work. They have to keep up producing original and high quality merchandise for the Atom Store.
---
Yes to this! I love pistols and getting entirely new one would be great and could be worked with lore as it was brought by the brotherhood.
---
I'm on PC and I've had all the problems you mentioned with him. Had a run where he disappeared just yesterday.
---
I could be wrong, but I think there's something wonky about the math behind it.  Like, the bonus is calculated off critical damage alone, not a percentage of the sum of normal damage plus critical damage.  It doesn't end up being as big a deal as the percentage would lead you to believe it is.
---
Subject to change in Tuesday's rebalance.  This is the kind of issue it was intended to fix.
---
Unarmed weapons as far as I know are the only bugged ones
---
Edit: I think there may be a few others like the other post said that are just mislabeled in the game files
---
they probably think reduced damage and stabilized perk is enough to wear power armor... as a hoarder with almost full carryweight all the time i never use power armor again. Backpack mod alone outperform cw and not talking about legendary. You can easily make 1ton difference....
---
That's a great idea, also increase the camp budget, at least double or more, I'm tired of living in a two floor camp without ceiling, haha.
---
I spent probably over 1000 scrip, and I only got 2 good weapons. One was an Explosive Combat Shotgun and the other was a Two-Shot Explosive 10mm SMG
---
This was after getting 3 Mutant Slayers Pipe Pistols in a row, 2 Bows with awful perks, and way too many Harpoon Guns and Railway Rifles to count
---
I love the RNG so much
---
Always good finding plans
---
damn i feel the same as the camp items that lack support
---
I feel like there should a "Digital Library of Congress" that would store the source code for influential pieces of software to become open source at some point in the future or when the product is no longer available.
---
I've been having a lot of crashes lately, although some seem to be related to people using particular hacked weapons on PC at boss fights.
---
Arg, sorry ... PC
---
No, one special stat card at time which has 4 ranks (+1, +2, +3 and +5). Meaning you can't use 2 x STR cards for total of +10 STR.
---
I have seen a wide range of prices.  One even sold for 25k caps.  But it may have been a cap sink for a high level player.  But it can spawn near a well known spot.
---
there's a fixed spawn in the world. 
---
i suppose someone could trade something if they really wanted one and didn't know
---
Don‚Äôt worry, we have a big nerf to all our guns incoming! Isn‚Äôt that exciting content :)
---
Hey libby üçª
---
Step one : put on Chinese stealth armor 
---
Step two: fast travel to the overseers camp
---
And await new vault dwellers.
---
Step three: sit next to overseers camp ( I like to crouch on top of one of the work benches or the stash box)
---
Step four: stand up and scared the crap out of the new vault dweller then chase them all the way to Socum Joe's shouting " free supplies to noobs" 
---
Extra style points  if you have a flaming shishkebab in hand or manage to scare a group of friends just starting together.
---
My psn is x-Rickrock-x, hit me up I can get you some materials and stuff to get you going
---
Honestly? Follow your quest log. The opening quests are bursting with xp, and useful gear for your level. 
---
It also walks you through mechanics of the game like obtaining clean food and water, camp building, etc. it also gives you schematics which help building your character. Speaking of schematics...
---
Loot and breakdown every gun and piece of armor you find. Every scrapped weapon and armor gives you a chance for mod schematics. No joke you can play for less than an hour and make better guns and armor then you can find if you just keep scrapping and making new versions. 
---
You should also setup a camp sooner rather than later. The overseers camp in flat woods is a logical place to begin making gear as it has benches set up for you. Eventually, your going to want to need a place to rest (for that sweet well rested xp), craft/repair weapons, make ammo, collect food and water, etc. it doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy, hell throw down a bed, stash, workbenches, water/food and your set. My first base was a haphazard jumble of crafting stations thrown on the ground. 
---
Ultimately the game provides everything you need in the form of junk and schematics if your thorough.
---
Good luck vault dweller!
---
The halloween store basement wallbreach still works. Theres a 3 star sentrybot down there. From spawn in to kill its about 3 minutes, plus server hop time, so 4 to 5 minutes. Not bad for a guranteed spawn
---
It was never 200, it launched as 400.
---
You can't.
---
Im reasonably sure they said at some point that the floating issue is fixed in the next patch. Also I hardly think it‚Äôs fair to place blame on the employees when it‚Äôs likely a combination of poor management who rush products through rather than allowing suitable testing time and the fact that such a small team is working on the game to begin with.
---
It just needs guilds and a pvp world that‚Äôs actually fun. Elder Scrolls is a great example of a thriving pvp world that‚Äôs always running, and makes grinding in adventure fun because you can get things there to make you stronger in the pvp land. Guilds are needed so people will actually talk to each other and coordinate activities like dungeons, raids, and pvp strategies. 
---
I have a feeling FO76 will evolve toward being more like ESO over the next 2-3 years, and I‚Äôm looking forward to that because I love the gameplay and content of ESO, but I much prefer the world or Fallout.
---
You can do this just save it as a blueprint
---
crippled a legendary sheepsquatch not half an hour ago.
---
I sell them for 50 caps max. It is a fixed world spawn on the westek rooftop...
---
**Yes please** but only if stored camps can ALWAYS be placed exactly back where they were, no exceptions.
---
Blueprints can't always be placed back the same way, or sometimes at all. Green when placed is not always green when replaced.
---
I absolutely loathe people that go to workshops and shoot low levels in the back while they‚Äôre in a menu and then say ‚ÄúIt was a PVP area they should have known better.‚Äù 
---
People like that are truly the lowest scum in 76 history.
---
Correct.  Some are easy like join another team with a player or take a photo at your camp.  Level up is one where it can be a grind depending on your level.  It is account wide so people level up their mules and it counts.
---
Weeklies are a little harder like taking over 5 workshops.  Not to bad.
---
Agree on all counts especially the camp budget, 2 yrs down the track and it is still pathetically small considering all the camp items being sold in the atom shop and the the scrip limit is terrible, just been to the purveyor and after about 6 rolls of the dice came out with crap gear already had got my daily scrip down to 14 scrip so I could not even scrip them, so I just dropped all the gear on the floor as my vending machine is full, so any legendary's I pick up between now and tomorrow will either be sold at a vendor or dropped.
---
Oooh, the mythical "banhanmer", that has never banned anyone gltiching anything in 2 years...
---
WoooOOOOOooooh!
---
People might be confused about the fact that you can't use let's say 2 x STR cards, only one of each special stat can be used at the same time. Meaning, you can't have two different STR cards to get total of +10 STR, but only one card giving max +5 STR. But you can use one card for LCK, one for STR, one for INT etc etc at the same time.
---
Amen, I vaguely remember a snide comment from Fallout 4 about the armor being designed for operations in hostile environments. But the disease things on a minor inconvenience.
---
Anything that doesn‚Äôt suck!  Too expensive for what it is currently as we will all invariably switch to whatever the current ‚Äúcool head‚Äù is I currently rock the reclaimed mm mask with my secret service armor. At least it has a head lamp. And honestly armor isn‚Äôt exactly exactly the du jour cosmetic.
---
Maybe add rad resistance or invis.
---
Got ya. It's bugged but OP's claim of limb damage only is wrong.
---
I've gotten some nice melee weapons from it then.  I've given most of them away because I don't run melee but that is kind of a nice bug for those that do.
---
Yeah but Vampires is very sought after
---
You describe exactly what i was experiencing ü§£
---
2 easy and quick to check mag spawns here

---
I have no experience on this myself, but i remember reading some post awhile ago that claimed that only direct hits have the ability to cripple, not the explosive splash damage. No idea if this is true or not.
---
game struggles to load what we have
---
That would be nice, i would like to see a daily increase from 150 to 300. Maybe I just hoard loot but I feel guilty when I drop a few 3 stars in random boxes or just sell them to a vendor. If possible I track down newer players and give them a boost.
---
First person i was told it works. No promise
---
They already have something that highlights targets so it‚Äôs definitely not impossible. Perhaps they could do something later that lets you mod headwear in general.
---
Make more windows, delete lights.
---
Lights will kill your build
---
Try to build towards these cards if you want to be tanky:
---
Strength: barbarian and blocker (max them out)
---
Endurance: fireproof (unless you run dense chest piece), and rejuvenate 2 stars (this is for AP and health)
---
Agility: dodgy and action boy (dodgy uses AP to avoid damage, so you need action boy and rejuvenate to feed AP into dodgy)
---
Luck: serendipity and ricochet (maxed out)
---
With those cards you‚Äôll be quite tanky. Just slowly work your level up until you have those cards and the special points to equip them. 
---
Also, try to do the brotherhood of steel fort defiance quest line early so you can get the brotherhood of steel recon rifle plans and make that gun for yourself at any level.
---
I think Grahm can spawn with any super mutants voice. There‚Äôs his normal voice like what he used in meat week, and sometimes he spawns with a voice from those slow talking grumbly super mutants that sound like they have a speech impediment.
---
Well one gun army definitely makes earl stop in his tracks. On my heavy, I prefer junkies over AA
---
My game rarely crashed before. After the last patch, I've been crashing a lot more.
---
I always sell that kind of stuff at like 100 caps per star rank of legendary. I live right outside a station so lower levels can pick up some easy script if they've got the caps.
---
3 3* and 2 2* is what I aim for
---
ok.  I am also trying to take into account of patch 22.  Seems like anti amor and junkies are neck and neck with non pa users.   I was thinking stabilized perk may bring AA over the edge.
---
Looks like i was right. Both posts removed.
---
I love this. I haven‚Äôt moved my camp since BETA because it‚Äôs built juuuuuuust the way I like it. Being able to slot in new camp builds and new locations without the broken blueprint system would be amazing. It‚Äôd let me have camps with different themes and use different atom shop items I bought. Endless potential. Great idea!
---
Definitely seems like a decent enough gun to run for the time being. Definitely can change once we can solidify the new meta in the upcoming patch.
---
I totally agree but the benefits do not out way the hassle of being in a public group and either being followed around or begged for gear/ammo 
---
It's got so bad that I am now back to lone wanderer and not being in a public team and not using both of these mutations.
---
Have you played on pc? Nearly lvl 500 and only experienced this a couple of times but when I played on console it was every other day
---
Yes!  That would be amazing!
---
I'm not sure what to say about all that. I guess the way I built my girls character might more on that spectrum though. That toon can take all the abuse and keep going, definitely one of the tankiest characters I've seen not using power armor.
---
You heal any health that is not affected by rads. It doesn‚Äôt heal rads so it won‚Äôt actually affect the rate you receive rads
---
Are the cards permanent or can be swapped?
---
What about VE?
---
Is that on PC or something? I‚Äôm on Xbox and I‚Äôve had this happen twice in months of play. I just ignore the messages, block the player, or help them if it‚Äôs a reasonable ask (and again, I was only harassed twice for free stuff).
---
They still cripple as when i run out of AP i just spam the trigger and normally see at least one enemy hobbling along.
---
Same exact thing happened to me. Pretty sure you at least still get rewarded as if you launched it but I could be wrong
---
Was it 400 to 600 then? I thought there was another number in there and it didn't go from 400 to 800 but I'm just going off of what I've read from people talking about it. My bad, like I said I started when it was 800 I've only heard about the other limits before it from reading posts and shit and I got a shitty memory lmao
---
There are power armor pieces on display at the Purveyor's. Have been since she was added to the game. It'll happen.
---
I have not played solo once since the teams function was launched. And not once have i been followed or begged for items. Only couple hearty greetings now and again. Jumping into or creating a team takes 1 seconds and has only benefits when compared to non-team solo play. But everyone can play as they like ofcourse.
---
This gets me everytime. Especially when I see people build an almost entire city block with different structures and you cant build a small bungalow.
---
Yeah I figured it wasn't just consoles having these problems
---
Yeah
---
Because when the game launched there was no real end game except hoping and praying. Then, due to incredible demand, they introduced the purveyor. So to keep people from just running through the 1000 legendaries they had built up and instantly having a strong end game build, they introduced caps to limit people. It's trickled through their design philosophy every step of the way since then.
---
They could absolutely reduce some of the caps with no negative impact on players longevity, but for the most part people who've set a goal to get x kind of gear would get their goals much faster and quit playing much sooner if they did. Then beth loses potential income on atomic shop and 1st sales.
---
People are unaware that is a gun in new Vegas
---
I also forgot about how it should work like armor so you can wear that and cosmetics.
---
Mine just changes resolution, it's fucking bizarre. My desktop  resolution is the same as in game but halfway through an earle fight  my resolution pops to 720p and annoys the shit outta me. Sometimes restarting doesn't even fix it
---
You sure it was Lucky Hole Mine?  I farm it for lead twice a week and can only recall one spot with ankle deep water.
---
I would give you a reward for this but I'm stingy, like bethesda. So no the two only developer won't work on the PA. Excuse me while I'm crying in the corner
---
Cosmetic only. They took away legendary Free Radicals Mask, they won't add more useful headgear. The helmets that give breathing perks are already sus
---
Good talk, buddy.
---
Well, I do take mainframe cores with me pre made. But that‚Äôs not a glitch. And I break the lock and hack the terminal rather than fix the reactor, again a shortcut but not a glitch.
---
Happened to me last week. Been playing since Beta, have clocked about 420 hours and was still waiting for kid free Saturday morning to have no distractions to run thru a silo and all of a sudden got the trophy for "I am become death". Took me a bit to figure out it was a team thing.
---
Bet! Thanks, its sad I have to use an exploit to get what should be available easily in game lol
---
It doesn't affect the charge, only the spam fire
---
lol.  "I got this legacy fair and square.  Never mind I have only been playing for 7 months."
---
And don't forget
---
Emergency Deduction Port.
---
Enclave bunker sells it but you'll most likely have to servor hop a bit. The "general store" one by all the workbenchs and stashes. I forget exactly how much but it does get a bit pricey.
---
So often it doesn't work. Also the blueprints have limits which means you can't save you're entire house
---
Other than finding the occasional sheepsquach idk where to go. Damn, windegos aren't even legendary now, just glowing.
---
It‚Äôll be a long while until the next one, so they‚Äôll have plenty of content since then. Wasn‚Äôt around for the beta but this is just as filling as the other games when it comes to meaningful quests.
---
Not enough npcs right now though, of course. Last couple of quests didn‚Äôt really have any npcs around, and I get it‚Äôs mostly because of us, lore wise, but there‚Äôs only so many people always online.
---
Keep going into quests expecting to meet npcs, only to find them dead. There‚Äôs also their whole Mayor Grafton joke about robots.
---
Go photo mode then un photo mode
---
Damn I guess I was getting lucky cuz it used to be that every second to third server hop id get a 3 star Goul
---
Try burrows, capital, generals, radio dish just north of west tek, sometimes the damn.
---
Edit: Harpers Ferry when it has supper baddies.
---
I honestly dislike the shit outta the devs and don't understand how they have pride in how they treat this game
---
The ss helmet has a headlamp
---
Always hit up awol at least 1 3star there.
---
Do we speak about how their is almost no difference in damage/radiation reduction between PA?
---
Lol thanks.  It was my in game name until someone reported it.
---
Bet, thanks. Like, im just trying to take advantage of the mumbles sale and buy some modules while they are cheap
---
u/ladydevann would you be able to pass this wonderful idea on?? :)
---
Happens to me at whitesprings, I‚Äôll run down the stairs to the shops and then it bounces me back to the doors
---
Bet, thanks
---
Drusell wasn‚Äôt asking you
---
It gets people logging in every day to do all the capped bullshit. Just like other MMOs where you can only do so much of a certain thing every day. It's an ass backwards way of having dailies in the game.
---
No problem happy hunting out there sorry my first comment was a little snarky!
---
Hopefully sometime in the future A Gunrunner Arsenal Update. Balance out all weapons, buff some that are severely underpowered, remove weapons that are essentially useless and just a waste of space.
---
Meh tbh I kinda like them. I hope they don't get fixed. I like big explosive guns. They're fun. I have a BE gat plas and using it to just detonate whatever is in my way is some of the most fun ive ever had in any game. Idc about balance. A game at the end of the day should be fun. They don't hurt anyone (unless we are talking about lag, which should totally be fixed). So I say leave em be.
---
If you can get to the 3rd floor of fort defiance you can find quite a bit
---
also

---
A poison resistance option for PA of some kind would be great.  Legendary perk, w/e, some option
---
Agreed. You are doing it great
---
Went photo mode with show player and without took pics still ghosted.
---
Same on PS4. Been playing public teams daily since they dropped and never once followed or begged for anything.
---
That happens to me too. I go to run west tek only to be followed around by a bunch of level 15s looking to leech XP from me. I dont mind usually but man that can get annoying fast.
---
Enforcer appears to be bugged for a lot of people. Used to cripple every 2 to 3 shots but now I'm lucky if it's 1 in 10.  Not sure when it happened as I've mostly been using a magic pump action. Found out when I picked up a low level shotty to try and solo Radiation Rumble
---
It depends on your build but anti armor or bloodied is pretty good
---
I once got two ghoulslayer ffr radiation guns from earl. One off the body one for completing it. Kms
---
I have the max gunsmith perk and my tse lever action and handmade breaks so quickly after I always have to bring both guns with me cause even if I repair them to full health they will break during the colossal problem event and same with my stealth armor it has never broken until about a week ago and now it breaks every 5 minutes
---
if you don't want to be bloodied or junkies then i suggest instigating if not go for AA or furious. you'll do silly damage with instigating with the right perks.
---
Yea they have a very backwards thinking. Instead of making the game satisfying and addictive, they attempt to make people struggle so that they will have to spend more time in game. Weaker weapons, tougher trash mobs and rarer legendaries, then in the end after all the trouble we get rewarded a one star rolling pin by the endgame bosses.
---
Thats rare? Oh...
---
The fact that a dog can bite you through power armor is just silly.
---
What does your heart tell you?...
---
what do you play on? i have thousands of them that i‚Äôve collected and never used.
---
In the next update
---
We add companions
---
WE NEED IT
---
Haha just messing. Great post!
---
Explains why item physics is client-side.
---
I spent about 1250 scrip so far on armour pieces,  trying to get either a set of bolstering combat armour or scout armour.  I got everything but bolstering.  The rng gods just don't like me. üò£ now I have tonnes of armour pieces to get rid of.
---
You get a free unmodded ultracite as part of a quest it may have been that.
---
Had this happen to me but I got stuck suspended halfway down the shaft in clipped into the rubble, since I didn‚Äôt die and couldn‚Äôt loot I just danced the timer away. üòÖ
---
There already is. It says "Steal From"
---
Yeah. He also said that this community is the equivalent of a spoiled child, which is spot on imo
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rare but it was the only one he had that I hadn‚Äôt learned
---
thanks a lot guys. 
---
Found the blood.  After got a problem analyzing it.
---
Managed to finish the quest ONLY thx to the guy who has a private server (premium fallout76). That's so poor
---
The idea is to feed the shareholders enough money that they want to continue making the game last.*
---
I thought the underground fire/lava mine was fuckin sick too
---
TIL trading is not "fair and square"
---
If you get gamepass the game is included, will still need to pay for first, but worth looking into 
---
But no, the steam won‚Äôt transfer over
---
Stay tuned
---
On xbox, pulling up the items you have favorited and trying to pick what you opened it for literally makes the game stutter, at least when moving while it's open. It turns into a slideshow and lags like crazy just from looking at your favorited items lol
---
&gt;while Bethesda might wish to sweep that game under the rug
---
Reason number 500 that the Fallout fandom is just... absolutely terrible overall: Fans who keep on trying to push this narrative despite numerous references to their precious New Vegas.
---
I know i have to buy the game again but will the data transfrer?
---
Base carrying capacity with full set of PA should be 300
---
When you wear PA, you lose the various benefits of your other armor pieces.
---
No, it won‚Äôt transfer.
---
And I‚Äôm saying if you get gamepass you don‚Äôt have to buy the game, it‚Äôs included
---
Also the backpack perks. So for example, I lose the chem weight reduction in the backpack.
---
Just checking that you know that legendary armor and backpacks are unequiped when entering PA?
---
ok thanks for letting me know
---
Take a break, hopefully the bos content is legit, come back for that and just login on Tuesday‚Äôs for the freebies
---
I feel the same way. With the slow removal of PvP, we are left a game now trying to become a co-op game but built to be a survival. Its wierd and feels like the game lost its identity.
---
Four Leaf Clover is very bad. The odds are extremely low, despite what the description implies
---
I got a great flamer recently too and did this on earl.
---
Went back and took off a mod or two that didn't impact damage (or range, surprisingly big difference long nozzle made to actually hitting), doubled the repair with weapon artisan, and put on gunsmith.
---
The damage is so far beyond even my TSE gatling plasma, I figure gunsmith to get more out of it is actually worth it *shrug*
---
Still only for certain fights and weighs a ton.  But it's nice to be able to say "fuck this scorchbeast" and it's dead in a second
---
And the vault 94 mask. Seriously, at least the helmet has an extremely bright headlamp.
---
The main stash space should be 1600 since people just create other characters. Each year it should increase by 800. Or just let us buy more with gold bullion. Like 500 pounds more for 500 gold bullion
---
Yep. Its not just legacies. Thats what I'm trying to say.
---
Huh
---
Yep, takes time but if you do it over and over with big items it works
---
if you are going to fight, fight to win?
---
I only do vanilla runs every now and then  to keep it fresh in my head in case they eventually patch the glitches you use to get through the silo, or when I‚Äôm running it through for the first time with someone who hasn‚Äôt done it before. And then I will go the whole nine yards. Even then it‚Äôs only about 20 minutes max. I have enough firepower to take on everything the silo will throw at us even if they do nothing.
---
When they had the Legendary Run challenges for building I only ever did those at workshops. I like how my camp is currently and don't want to risk having undeletable shit in my camp. I had to deal with having a extra stairs and floors for months because they could not be deleted. The building needs an undo or revert feature really bad.
---
I‚Äôm going to be honest - these two (and other team perks) shouldn‚Äôt be activated if your in a team of just yourself.
---
True. If I'm in a public event with a ton of low levels and see them struggling against the sbq i just pull it out and melt them away
---
How on earth did you get up there?
---
Also, great job on the photo for the camp!
---
the Fallout 1st tents used to let you respawn on them on death, that doesn't seem to work anymore...
---
If the resources were buffed you would see more people taking them and building them up to defend them. Back at the start the ammo factory was the only good workshop and it always saw action. If you wanted pvp go there and you would get it. But they nerfed its output of ammo and since then it hardly gets taken.
---
"Your C.A.M.P. could not be placed. Place a different C.A.M.P. or find another world."
---
Serum recipes are pretty expensive, and buying gold every week.
---
You can actually find pretty good guns in peoples vendors and you can buy bobbleheads for specific buffs.
---
I actually think Beth did an amazing job keeping some value with caps
---
&gt;So I can have 8000 different items if they weigh 0.1
---
Have you tried opening you inventory with 8000 different items? It lags like crazy.
---
I agree with this 100%. It would change nothing for pve players but it would help promote pvp at workshops only.
---
&gt; So should be an easy ban then or?
---
IIRC it was you who said that he's playing mmo for over 30 years... That leads me to believe you are getting senile when you forget what you are asking, that fast.
---
I defend people who do stuff legitly, and I still believe in "innocent until proven guilty".
---
And just because you can not imagine something, that does not mean it does not exist.
---
I've had the same issue with West Tek and the super mutants. Nothing more frustrating of finding an very dead and very unlootable 3 star legendary. Whomp whomp.
---
I agree, highly doubt Bethesda would ban anyone at this rate. Seen too many camps with 2-4 of these machines, seen them multiple times as well.
---
It would probably drop their income of FO1st, if they did ban. Something Bethesda definitely doesn't want. So I fear that Bethesda is afraid to ban anyone for this reason. Some of the camps I saw, were from FO1st members (I know cause they were using Camp items only obtainable from FO1st.)
---
I love this idea
---
A lot of them can be good if they have magic effects. I‚Äôve gotten a few from events or purveyor but once I unlocked it I crafted first time and got a 2 star bloodied one and I‚Äôm bloodied so I said good enough
---
&gt;  conduit and rug glitch
---
I‚Äôve occasionally been harassed but it‚Äôs easy enough to ignore then fast travel out.
---
Actually had a level 22 follow me around the bog today, stimmed him a few times but got tired of carrying this guy that went out of his way to not tag the stuff near me, forcing me to use ammo instead of melee to save him. 
---
But that kind of thing is rare, and I kinda enjoyed showing him a preview of a high level area
---
I will happily listen to mole miner grunts and other noises whilst I slaughter their brethren during Uranium Fever
---
Where do you draw the line?
---
If you ask me, PvP should be free of restrictions. The most dedicated sniper can't take you out in a single shot, and that's silly. A hammer to the head should have no damage cap.
---
Do we allow Gauss shotguns? Why?
---
Explosive plasma Gatling devils?
---
My dream PvP is revolvers only.
---
AWESOME!! Im so jelaous that wasnt my idea! Its just fabolous! &lt;3
---
First time in forever last night I had a level 37 asking for over 5k screws gears lead and steel and weapons. I ignored him. I let him tag along for 2 queen fights and a earl fight. So he should be happy
---
Appalachia metal
---
I‚Äôve been thinking this since launch. I have a cabin I‚Äôve been building since then in the northwest, and as much as I want to try something new, I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it
---
I've recently moved CAMP to a completely new location because when I accidentally moved the box, I was unable to place any of my blueprints back where they came from. Blueprints are terrible at placement. OP's idea is that the placement of the entire CAMP be saved along with the structure, and everything should pop back in right where it was.
---
I want to duel wield in exchange for no vats, it would be a horrible build but damn fun
---
I think it's pretty simple where you draw the line.  Group events where people have time invested such as encrypted and colossal problem should not get ruined by one person's weapon.  Line in the sand other group events where people have less invested should be completed without Tesla's if at all possible.  when playing solo where you will not affect anyone do whatever you want.  It's just a matter of being polite at this point don't ruin other people's fun because unfortunately your gun got glitched by Bethesda.  The annoyance level is directly proportionate to the amount of work people have invested in the challenge.  If I launch a nuke and my frame rate gets dropped to three because someone can't put away their legacy Tesla I'm going to be unhappy.  If I'm not able to pick up junk after lying in the sand I'm probably just going to be ready to move on to another event.  Me personally as someone who is trying very hard to be a good steward for the game I have totally put down my Tesla until Bethesda fixes this.
---
Yeah it'd be cool to integrate a way to do this or just have a way to customize what plays from the radio at our camps. I mean, you could just go around with your mic on and have your mic up to the speakers youre playing music from... It'd be low fidelity but kinda funny to have literally a sort of radio station of your own at the rusty pic, granted you'd have to stay there and fill in with your commentary between songs
