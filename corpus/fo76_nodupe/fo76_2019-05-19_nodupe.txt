No problem.

---
I didn't say that. And pacify should always be an RNG chance. I was taking about not being able to send one home as a pet or maid. So what if it's niche. Those cards are supposed to somewhat mirror each other but they are broken. I say that because to get an animal as a pet you don't need just Animal Friend. You have to have Wasteland Whisperer as well.
---
I’ve heard about a lot of interest and guys trying to organize events like this but never seen it live up to its hype. I hope you can pull it off!
---
I sell full, 100% cores for 45 caps.  Bargain basement prices.
---
I want to be wrong but I think I have to go with 
---

---
D) Neither
---
Again, I want to be wrong but I used a Holo at Level 76 (no pun intended) at an Ash Heap Tower and the supply drop was utterly worthless.
---
Now I'm Level 82 and want to try one nearer to The Mire or Cranberry Bog and see if it is different.
---
I picked that up about an hour ago at one of the plan spawns between the plasent valley cabins fast travel location and the raider PA spawn. The 2 that are in the same "building" seem to be random armor plans from what I can tell
---
Aren’t they at almost every location?
---
Hm I’m not sure then. Which type of combat armor are you trying to modify light, sturdy or heavy?
---
Dude this was definitely a good call. Between that and a short walk around looking for a workbench, killing all the mole miners in the area, I walked away with enough ore for 200 lead and 250 steel, along with over 300 steel scrap from the more miner loot.
---
I haven’t tried controlling for Charisma yet, but I definitely will. Like I said, there’s a lot more analysis to be done, this is just my preliminary results. I’m still collecting data too :)
---
To make you buy Atoms.
---
Because everyone wants it
---
Well then it’s either bugged or bgs genuinely don’t have a clue. I’m sure it will be changed as obviously in the survival mode that makes no sense
---
Finding out what happened to the other slipper is the new endgame.
---
This. Main character lvl 172 who’s mele, sniper is 111, Demoman is 102, and gunslinger who’s 91. Whatever mood I’m feeling I just change characters. Like you said stacking exp buffs and teams are game changers for alts.
---
I just saw some guy making a big arena on XB1 at the car arena thing. Was that you?
---
Also there is so lame stuff in atom shop :(
---
The title is worthy of a r/nocontext award
---
Yep Xbox 1
---
Dude,  tell me about it.  I'm trying to be a wasteland scourge and all these restrictions are really cramping my style.
---
Thanks!
---
It would not.  It would require Bethesda to do a little programming though, which they are averse to doing.
---
2 minutes on my phone,  best I could do atm

Nah not me, I’m right buy top of the mountain station
---
Except it's not in the atoms shop. Those bulb letters are far worse.
---
Thats a two shot explosive shotgun. Most likely a combat version. I have one and that’s probably the best way to describe the sound. It crackles with every shot, and the combat can put out a lot of shots fast.
---
Old glitch where you were able to scrap foundations/stairs and make the camp "float" in the air
---
I know somebody who made a dragon camp, and another who made a bigass blimp
---
It’s an interval of 30
---
30, 60 or 90
---
Can’t recall off the top of my head
---
I would lose the 1h melee and get some weight perks. Swap cannibal for fireproof 3. I'd lose sandman because it's rarely useful, also the perk for not triggering traps trade for dodgy or something. There are basically no traps and you'll be immune to mines with fireproof
---
How in the world does one acquire one?
---
“I fucked up the joke and now I’m mad you don’t get it.”
---
residual imaging left by someone who logged off kind of like the power armor that remains when someone fast travels away at times.
---
It used to be it'd just store your whole camp and most of time make it impossible to place it again. I prefer this way more
---
That's incredible
---
I need me a bow. Its so aesthetic and a joy to use.
---
Right?
---
To use a gear to repair a Bowie knife!
---
Thank you. I literally just found it before you wrote it.
---
It's the true endgame
---
Technically serum recipients are 23k. Nobody buys them though.
---
I actually just found the Bot at Janet's Soft Serve. On PC if anyone needs it lol
---
Update: Photography works with the cargobot from the Collision Course event, but I had to be about 12 feet away from it (right as it was setting up to drop off the package).
---
We should be able to place extra cameras we have in our vending machines. I have 4-5 spares in my stash (would have more if I didn't stop picking up broken ones that I keep finding). I'd be happy to sell them for 10 caps a piece as it looks like there are still players looking for them.
---
Sweet so we have a temporary way to restore the stats. Now that I know this I’m leaning towards it being a bug. One can hope it is at least. Thanks for the information.
---
I got mine off of a sub on Reddit for sales of items (for caps or trades, not real $). I don’t think I can say it’s name. I just had to grind for the daily cap limit, selling all the weapons and chems I picked up as I cleared areas. Then when I had over 5k, I started watching the market for this game on here and I got a 2* tse Combat and a 3* pump explosive for 7k as a package deal. I’ve been busy making shotgun shells in my spare time ever since. It was designed to have a player to player market, so save up your caps, then go treat yo self!
---
Don't swim past the buoys, touch them and then swim back towards the docks, then go to the next buoy.
---
But why is the blueprint budget smaller than the CAMP budget?
---
Smae exact same situtation with me. I was fine one moment but then when i quit to the menu amd back to do an event all my stuff is delisted and no message that my camp spot has been taken.
---
Are you on XB1?
---
well you guys proved no reason to come back thanks. that many downvotes for asking if things are better. Great community left!
---
I completely understood the point. It was simply a thought I had.
---
He can also stimpack you!
---
Mentat addiction, huh?
---
Thanks! Next we need a list of the bugged items, so we dont waste our time trying them
---
Personally, I wish the animated cards were [just slightly] better than the non-animated ones. Such as Picklock having a bigger sweet spot, or Rifleman 1 having an 11% damage increase instead of 10%. Like you said, it seems like the animations are a wasted effort...
---
It’s Pink, if that helps.
---
No
---
I got 5 legendaries yesterday from non-legendary scourge....   4 from West tex 2 hours ago as well.
---
Nope ps4
---
I will, thank you!
---
Yeah, happened to me today, and it is tedious as hell to go back in and reprice everything. 
---
I’m pretty sure BGS knows about this but I’ve read nothing in the dev notes about it.
---
A level 400 set up in PVE gear and with the pacifist toggle on (so they don't accidentally damage someone's came through some trees) will get absolutely wasted by a smart and decently equipped/perked L30 PVPer   
---
Levels are meaningless when one person mounts an attack when they're set up for PVP and their target isn't.
---
this would be a good idea and not super op because I can run through the whitesprings with level 3 can do and get a ton of food from the trash a passive way to get food could be nice and be something worth fighting other players for
---
You will benefit from more valuable caps, as you have the max.  The tax increases the value of your 25k.
---
Putting my Dev hat on, I don’t think they want you to stop suggesting things.  Player input is very important, and they don’t want to shut down creative thinking.  
---
Also, just because you don’t see comments on this reddit, or quick feedback or changes in game, doesn’t mean it’s not seen.  
---
&lt; saying this for BGS cause I suspect they want to and can’t.  Because.... reasons.   &gt;
---
Only when I’ve been teamed up. When that happens one of us won’t have the pictures count so we have to leave the team and then the photos work.
---
They’re available on the market for that console too. Facebook has some markets too.
---
Haha, I used to do that with paint brushes in Oblivion.
---
its an event I have only seen it pop up once though
---
If your stash gets to 800/800 it resets all your stores.
---
You said the simplest solution is that all crafting cards cost no points
---
I’m saying your solution (as you have resented it in your first response) lets players have more crafting capabilities than they have under the current system 
---
So yes, the current limits make more sense than the passives cost now points
---
Otherwise, tell me how a 5 INT character can have both gunsmith 5 and science 2 to add a fancy mod
---
Can I add you too lol?
---
Uh, ok.. .the git gud.
---
two levels a day with cranberry relish and well-rested is really not that hard.  you can't let yourself get caught up fixing up your camp and checking vendors and all that if you really want to level, take the workshop for free fast travel, hit the big mobs. I like monster mash just for the hordes of ghouls, and of course nukezones.
---
I can't get the plague a musical instrument ones to stick.
---
No team required.   If you see someone go down, stick em with a stimpack and its done.
---
Ya not too far off from there, maybe slightly east. I changed it though to the west of the site up on the mountains at the edge of the ash heap. Pretty far off but it’s epic watching the nuke explosions and scorchbeast attacks on watoga
---
Classic.....
---
Definitely A, B very highly unlikely or there would be multiple holos, not just a single bundle, unsure about C.
---
A TIP:  don’t spawn in at the closest location to where it is if someone is holding him.  Spawn in somewhere else and walk, otherwise that kills him!  Not to mention don’t be on a team.
---
I think Survival needs 5 things right now and it would make a huge difference: 
---
1. Cap reward limit raised to 100 caps, make Adventure cap at 50. Survival should be more profitable. 
---
2. Reinstitute the bankruptcy penalty, but make it a death sentence—100% Damage and DR debuffs in PvP—effectively forcing you out if you’re broke. 
---
3. Make all players (except teammates) invisible on the map, but add a “Heat map” system that shows where action is happening. You should be able to find players, but not be pointed directly to them. Stop showing the current leaders.
---
4. Make CAMPs destructible again but protect really expensive things like rad showers—they do really screw up the CAMP repair system. 
---
5. Raise the daily vendor cap to 2000 in Survival only, making the junk and aid you collect immediately valuable and giving an additional incentive to play the mode.
---
Still trying for Elder, though it's underwhelming.
---
Because in the beginning of the game, they didn't want people writing Dick on the side of their house, do a search of this forums and people have. written crazy stuff and inappropriate stuff on the side of the, they knew it was going to happen, so they put it out of reach of a lot of people but now it's probably time to drop the price ..
---
I run a Bloodied build on my second character. Not a big deal for me since she’s almost dead already. Kind of a waste of a stimpack, but I’m happy to help on XB1.
---
https://youtu.be/gAmOSIwe86E here are some of his voicelines and the case file
---
Trying to be helpful, but most people won’t even sell a TSE for less than 15k caps. You can probably get a two shot in your price range though.
---
you don't need more than 100 of any junk. let 100 be your guide. if you have less than 100 you need to go get that specific material for sure. if you have more than 100 you can sell that for profit. the goal is 100 across the line. the end game is 100, when I am not 100 I go make myself 100. when you are 100 you never have storage concerns. 100 is motivation to get motivation to sell motivation to search and retrieve. take a deep breath... clear your mind...become 100.
---
They did that very early on with their first bug/request response. We pushed back harder &amp; got FoV sliders, fps unlocked to physics &amp; I think a few others for it.
---
Keep being persistent with the suggestions.
---
Thanks its kinda hard keeping caps i guess not sure a good place to farm for caps.
---
Thanks for sharing.  
---
&lt;runs away skipping, lalalalalala you can’t destroy camps anymore, Hahahahahaha &gt;
---
Had to include for all the “wimps” (your words in another comment) out there who read the thread and don’t have the whatever to post a response.   
---
Camp immunity in Adventure mode was very well received by the casuals, and BTW they spend $$$ on atoms, hint hint.
---
I'm not sure if there is an order at all. My first and only BOS plan from Technical Data was BOS II. Now that I know that there's more I'll be sure to keep turning them in.
---
Carry weight and an ore mining productivity bonus....
---
I can't stress this kind of thing enough, I constantly try to talk to other to try and help them along with this, because it takes a little focus, and common sense.
---
I just wanted to know if there was a place with loads and if there’s a route I could work out
---
I would say that the Wendigo ending happens 1/10 times. Its rather infrequent. 
---
I agree, when people actually participate in the event it's easy peasy. But, you know, you can't lead a horse to water and make it drink it.
---
I don’t think you will have enough points to get shotgun heavy and melee all top tier. You can only have 15 points per SPECIAL and you max out total points at 55 I believe.
---
There's been an issue with turrets &amp; spotlights randomly disappearing for a while now. Can you tell if the vanished turrets are still taking up budget? If you didn't put them directly on the ground or an environmental object, you might be able to retrieve them from storage after storing whatever they were originally placed on. Otherwise, you might have to move camp to get that budget back, if that's the issue you're having.
---
Also, you are correct in that "destroyed" turrets should not be completely disappearing; if there's no sign of them at all, it's likely bug-related.
---
Get rekt griefer. Enjoy survival mode.
---
Good for you :) Just know that I'm not leaving anytime soon, and neither are people like me. BTW I get atom shop things too, just not your bitch-ass  FRIENDS WELCOME  sign lmao.
---
For merely wanting to defeat the creature that’s terrorizing Appalachia? 😭
---
I would if I could destroy CAMPs like I'm supposed to be able to.
---
I have gotten the:

---
Electrician
---

---

---
Photogragher
---
Rail enthusiast
---
Bugged that i know of:
---
Musician
---
Well the idea was to focus on heavy/shotgun, and melee just to be as an option if I needed it with whatever cards I end up getting from packs
---
No, when you get mad at a bunch of low levels for wanting to get some form of EXP. It's difficult at that level
---
Thanks! My walls are up, but I've got one section of roof that won't go.
---
Good for you.   I never said you should stop playing.  Keep on trucking! 😁
---
If they did do this, then they'll have to tax it hard to try to make it balanced and not abused.
---
I'm talking like NCR level taxes here.
---
Still waiting lol. I just want the weapons to feel like.. Something. The out of wack damage on every gun puts me off
---
found this a few days ago.  also enjoy the jaws easter egg
---
Too bad the ammo is always running out for me on mine lol
---
from what the word on the street is there is .. and I've seen some on ppl although I didn't ask cause I'm not creepy .. but this is why they are rare .. also I heard .. between you and me.. don't tell anyone, that there is a random # assigned to a newly generated character that doesn't change but affects loot drops/awards so make more characters play more often and buy more atoms ... cause this is the word of the lord .. amen
---
Yes but by rare we're talking 0.03% drop rate. It's pure luck. Some people, like me, can go months without getting one. Some people after a couple of tries.
---
Bad that i know of musician
---
Do you think those people don't know what they vendor for? Please stop doing this, they're purposely listed low to help people who need them. It's like you're taking from the community charity bowl at a church.
---
nothing to see here folks .. it just works .. move along
---
Oh, I will. I'm not JUST  a douche. The missions and stuff can be fun too, it's just my most enjoyable experiences in this game revolved around destroying C.A.M.Ps with those that I play with and then fighting with the people coming to defend it or just claim the bounty. Now it's all gone.
---
Melee is always good for backup. Especially shotgun builds. 9 shotgunner perks, plus others like blocker which is useful. Bloody mess. Tenderizer. Figure out if you want to be in power armor or not also.
---
Isn't it just ambient power like other lamps?
---
Everyone started as noob so that’s totally good but trying to hit and run is not a good way to get anything from this event, especially when this sheep follows its attacker all over the place, making it impossible for those who can actually kill her to do their part
---
Let's play guess the platform. You play on PC.
---
What all do you have in your stash box? Get the perks that lowers the weight for items when you carry it. It helps out alot
---
“A little” just turn it up in your settings
---
You have to hookup a power emitter. Power doesn’t have to be hooked up directly to lamp or most lights for that matter.
---
im surprised this thread doesnt get more attention. its true every word. makes pvp lame. survivabilitiy doesn't matter and all that matters is how good you are at sneaking around, lasering someone down quick and re-positioning.
---
I would say someone from the hood would use a 10mm SMG or a Handmade. 
---
But a fshewwwer sounds like an explosive shotgun to me.
---
The NCR IRS would like a word.
---
At what price? Just started vending yesterday and wondering about prices.
---
And this is why I raised my price for Serums to 500 caps.
---
Initiate doesn't drop since they added the rest, that's why you started with Knight.
---
Thanks
---
Get it, I have 13 different mutations and I don’t regret any of that. Equip max level starched genes and class freak and you’ll be fine. Healing factor is a great mutation.
---
And camping up on top of the shack IS a good way to do this event? Sometimes you just want to feel included, man, and the whole point of this game is to team up. So what if they don't do any damage? It's still damn fun to have that adrenaline rush
---
Is power armor needed for any content? I haven’t found any cores yet so I had assumed they are pretty rare to come by.
---
Same here, sold mine quickly.
---
You just need to wrap around the perimeter of WS. You still need to be careful. The supermutants to the north can level up and there's a SB to the South. 
---
It gets harder but that doesn't mean Watoga, the city in the south east is the hardest area. 
---
It sounds like you're looking for adventure. That's cool but that's what you're going to get if you do. Crazy high enemies. Just wait until you meet a sheepsquatch.
---
Over a staircase by any chance? No prob! 😊
---
Thank you!! This was driving me bonkers! 😊
---
No. It just splits the projectile up into smaller sources of damage. This however makes it easier to kill people considering you can stagger someone with 1 projectile and the rest will do full damage through sentinel. One reason it is so strong.
---
Montana
---
It's just below the alligator I believe
---
I need way more than 100 lead and steel like daily lol. I can go through a ton of 5mm on a SBQ.
---
I believe they should. Your end game camp should be able to completely refresh you after questing.
---
TIL, thanks.
---
Not super fancy, but it works in a pinch!
---
Thats keeping it 100!
---
I mean I’ve had the same 3 star marine drop a week apart... should you report me for duping!
---
Ahh, ok I don't see power emitter, must have passed over it or don't have the ability to make it. thanks. Wish it had told me when I purchased it
---
Theyre easy to find once you learn the map spawns. Everything but nuclear blast zones can be done without power armor/hazmat suit. I dont wear PA personally. Your build will eventually have either power armor or non power armor buffs to specialize in. Theres armor and weapon repair perks if you feel you need them also.
---
You can buy them from production, but they are considered medium armor, so they are mostly comsetic.
---
OK, will do. I have pack rat level 1, I think, and as the previous poster stated, I do try to keep 100 of everything I'd need to craft. I do keep too much ammo, too, and I've been trying to sell that off.
---
I’ve got the same problem. I just rebuilt my camp due to another another problem and have no patience to rebuild it again to deal with this bug.
---
medic 2 at most is all you need stimmys are easy to get and easy to craft .. they weight alot you tend to sell more than you'll ever use and they drop in survival .. personal experience is .. I drop it as a mut cause I do alot of narcotics and my perk pts are valuable so I tend to only max at 2 or 1 .. you really don't need to max class freak
---
You're purchasing your right to actually communicate in this game and therefore say naughty words Bethesda would have to put resources into censoring/responding to complaints.
---
Feel like it's the reason we can't leave any long messages easily. Like leaving notes or terminal entries
---
Best CAMP yet.
---
100 is my magic number, but I'm still in FO4 mode where I scrap and stash everything, so it creeps up. Ammo too. And purified water is supposed to be "so important", so I've got 50 lbs. of that, I'm sure.
---
Yet they have small letters for like less
---
Oof. Just read what I wrote, lololol dumb ass

What was for dinner if you don't mind me asking?
---
Dude, I sell Magazines, bobbleheads and stealth boys for like 25 caps and no one buys, I thought it was a steal of a deal. :/ Maybe Morgantown just isn't prime real estate.
---
What if you dont get all the scrip? Those pesky 2 that u cant get cause u didnt math right? Am i stuck?
---
I would like to unsubscribe from that program
---
Yes it’s absolutely an awesome adrenaline rush (kudos to Bethesda!). But yes when someone took the pylons it’s best to keep the sheep close to the shack and shoot her from the roof top with heavy weapons. She will dance in the same spot but won’t fire her laser very often, making her an easier target, it’s as if she has a hard time aiming her beam. The splash damage when explosive bullets hit the ground around her helps a lot too. Also the suicide eyebots don’t fly high, when you’re on the rooftop they can’t bomb you.
---
I would be down for this, I could finally open my medical store/ eatery. In a place people would be able to visit.
---
Turrets are a *huge* expense. I removed two of my four missle turrets, since this camp location doesn't get attacked often, and I got 1/8 of my budget back.
---
It’s under power connectors. Just use a connector that goes on a wall or roof close to the lamp. And hook a wire to it
---
What level are you? Don’t worry about cap farming and endgame weapons till at least 80
---
I think she would be traveling with clem,  they will surely have wonderful conversation.
---
Hook up a power connector near it.
---
Every train station has a board with poster on it. There's 3 posters at the moment. Reading each of them gives you the new quests.
---
yes i should your name motivates me to do so!!
---
although I have looted almost the same if not the same legendary when killin multiple enemies in and around the same time .. whitesprings is notorious for this .. some enemies even not labeled as legendary will drop legendaries which seemingly are copies of what you just looted on another dead enemy
---
Meh. I prefer rushing in and dying maybe 5 times and using like 30 stimpaks, It makes the reward feel better
---
Me either.
---
I've got a piece of two of armor that lower weapon weights by 20%, so I don't mind doing it.
---
Yeah, I got a vampire super sledge, so alas, Ol' Mr Handy now rests in my memory box, awaiting the day where I say "ahh, fuck it" and shred em.

Perfect, many thanks.

Not surprised to see this from someone who has A Clockwork Orange as his avatar.
---
Ammo 1cper dogfood6cper only sure movers. Plans rare and not, but they move slow. Lil bit of serums, but I see them for less than 500c on people's vendors. Since you can sell them to the robovendors for 500c sometimes I clear the daily capspool with them.
---
One if my favorite movies :)

---
I've walked in several times on different characters and had one spawn. Maybe it's not an "every time" thing.
---
Hah yes if she’s defeated then the reward will feel great. I tried melee once too but end up dying more than 5 times and lost the battle lol
---
What on Earth are you talking about?
---
Doing that challenge was hilarious
---
Healing Factor has no downside. The only reason to not use it would be a bloodied build. It heals you, very quickly, when you are in hidden status. To give you an idea of the heal speed, it heals faster than you can drown. I tried drowning to help a buddy get the swimming badge. I started to drown but then HF kicked in and kept me alive.
---
You'll never need a Stimpak outside of combat and if you are sneaky and such then you can get hidden between fights and negate the use of Stimpaks almost entirely.
---
I can't say that it has any effect on Stimpaks as I never use Stim in a situation where HF would be in effect. Stims are emergency use, within combat only, thanks to Healing Factor.
---
Yeah,  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I can say with fact i got all three jumpsuits and both enclave masks at one finishing uranium fever.
---
Yeah that really only works on lvl1. But just like in 4, new Vegas and 3, you can guess 3 times, exit the terminal and do it again. Just don't try the 4th time or you'll get kicked. The tries reset when you exit the terminal.
---
Well. Maybe you can add this data to your research. 
---
I got a 3* Furious gauss for my first (and only as of now) purveyor purchase. Before that, earlier today I found a gauss as well, I haven't found one in a long while. It was at the observatory, I'm not sure if it's an usual spawn there. Also I logged in there. 
---
So maybe the found gauss influenced the RNG. Maybe because I logged in next to a regularly occurring spawn influenced it (although I found it in an interior so maybe not)
---
I don't have it so i can't provide personal experience. However, I'd like to mention it only works outside of combat. Not sure if you're aware of that. So you'd still need to rely on stimpaks during combat.
---
Impressive use of the double period.
---
Thank you 😊
---
I agree. ( downvote all u want)
---
I had to fight off a scorchbeast that the cargobot had aggroed. And all the Scorched who came with it. And THEN, finally the cargobot. Ran out of ammo for my main weapon by the time that all finished.
---
In my experience you have to be very close to the subject.
---
I sell my holotapes for 1 cap a pop, just to get rid of them
---
We did a similar thing at gulper lagoon, seemed to work a treat! Glad you did it and thanks for the info
---
&gt;and for some atoms we can build one in our camp or make it as part of the rewards for the end game medical badges
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Alternative skins could be sold for atoms, but the machine itself should be available to everyone. Same goes for things like refrigerators since they're not just cosmetic and provide useful game mechanics.
---
Don't tie it to the scout challenges either. Instead, if the Auto-Doc is in game reward it should be a quest reward. Ideally, I would have given it out at the end of [An Ounce of Prevention](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/An_Ounce_of_Prevention). They were able to patch in Ultracite Power Armor to one of Fort Defiance's terminals. It'd be nice if they could do the same for Auto-Doc plans in the terminals in the medical center.
---
Also without power armor im at 700 damage resistance plus flat damage negating perks. Which is really good. Pvp is mostly done without power armor as well.
---

I have found its better to pick a specific weapon type and build around it. if you go shotgun go all in for shotgun, heavy ? all in , etc. there are builds who use universal perks only  and carry a lot of everything and they are viable but they spend way more time micromanaging than I prefer. also the more choices you have in weaponry the more inventory you have to manage in ammo and junk needed for repairs. 
---
example if you make a black powder rifle sniper, for ammo all you ever need junk wise is lead and steel - which means all other ammo types and gunpowder can go on the vendor. add wood and adhesive for repairing the rifle, sneaky sneak leather armor maybe? stealth centric? add cloth leather and ballistic fiber to your watch list. get the tricorne hat and ranger cloak and drop big old crits on stuff that aint even aware of your presence, super fun. 
---
My main is a heavy / power armor user. not any old heavy. energy weapons heavy specific, not just any heavy weapons specific but laser gatling heavy specific. not just any old laser gatling either its a vampiric laser gatling  whats that even mean !!?? I keep super stim packs only everything else med wise I sell. I use only fusion cores, they power my power armor and my weapon, I never have to craft ammo. I sell everything else, in fact I got 700 plus shotgun ammo still waiting for a buyer if you want. as far as junk needed because I wear X-01 armor with jetpack I need a small portion but wide range of repairing junk. aluminium,  plastic, steal, gears, plus laser gatling junk adds crystal fiber optic bundles etc. the advantage of my build is I spend hardly any time in crafting menues. I am required however to farm fusion cores. you get those from sentry bots at white spring or by taking power plants , I prefer power plants, Its probably faster to just make them but I would rather hold a powerplant longer than spend a few minutes in a crafting menu. thats me. you are you your needs are probably different. many people like to shift through junk and micromanage many types of ammo and junk many dont.
---
Yeah, that's how I'm used to doing it. Just noticed this and hadn't seen it before.
---
A downvote from a leaf-eater is worth 10,000 upvotes from Odin. To Hell with what these vegetarians think lol
---
I really want TSE turrets. Even with power armor the damn TSE turrets rip through my armor.
---
Agreed that there doesn't seem to be many mic users.  A couple things to consider...1) Some have families that are asleep, so they are quiet  2) some have mics off due to background noise, and it takes time to remember and fumble about turning it on.  3) many grew up with FO as a solo adventure, and old habits are hard to break.

I actually found a new spawn in front of gorge junkyard today
---
Seeing two of the same weapon does not signify duplication.
---
Seeing vendors with 350,000 junk for sale and when I look I see they have tens of thousands of pounds in weight of items. THAT signifies duplication.
---
Aha! I recognise your name now. I'll put you on the post
---
I thoughts ghouls are people who took hell of radiation but survives. While some had went crazy and are feral. Some are friendly.
---
I can help I need to revive someone in water too, what’s your psn
---
I've had it several times recently. Glowing creatures for the weekly. Mirelurk hunter for the tadpole. Various scorched creatures. Etc. I've had fine luck previously with it as long as their names appeared on the screen
---
I know, but I don’t want to get it only to find that it completely nerfs my stims. That -55% Chem effect would be a killer, especially if class freak was bugged. Just wanted to get my facts in order before getting it.
---
ive seen 7 so far from random enemies, my most recent was an Assassin's Machete with +50% limb damage and +1 Strength
---
I have it happen on par quite often I use a bloodied melee build so I'm shreking but idk why that would matter
---
Nuke it.
---
I pay 18k with perks and grape mentats for a serum recipe. When player vending began, I had one recipe, now I have 8. All bought from Whitespring bunker.
---
Hmm don't know of a way to directly destroy it, but i have heard of griefers spawning enemies and then luring them into your camp so they can destroy by proxy.
---
I wish I could destroy the camps where you spawn inside and they lock all the doors so you can’t get out without fast traveling twice :/ so lame. Don’t set up as a vendor and lock your damn doors
---
I noticed that I got Cpt before Sgt, that's why I'm selling Sgt. I haven't turned in many pieces of data, maybe twenty. I guess RNG is with me there since it's certainly not with me on legendaries. I'm carrying around four three stars I couldn't trade back in yet...
---
So if you charge 1 cap lower you save one cap in taxes...
---
You realize this equals nothing right?
---
This fool (meaning me) ventured there and not knowing exactly what was going to happen triggered Encryptid from the terminal. Took a look at the map and there was a crew of 3 higher level players very close by (me ~45, them 150&gt;&gt;). They joined right away and another joined from some where. Of course I died once quickly and out of the kindness of their heart, or from not noticing I was useless, revived me. After that I hid around the fringes and would snipe when it was vulnerable. Also took shots at a couple of secondaries. I’d run in and revive anyone who went down. In the end my foolishness was rewarded with credit for finishing this quest. It took quite awhile and with was a major lag fest.
---
Were you teamed up with anyone?
---
Man i never killed any vendor yet still get tons of wood from boss fights 🤮
---
Bethesda’s website.  Problem solved.  Or search bar in this sub.
---
In the mean time you can get bear,owlet, firefly,wolf, and wendigo
---
Yeah, they are a pain, imagine dealing with 9 of them at the same time tho /\_\\
---
I wasn't on a team, and didn't witness the damage so I can't say how he was destroying it.  Just going by the message I got from the other player and damage after the fact.
---
if you accept a random team invite your camp can risk being destroyed. i am unsure if wanted players can destroy your camp or not. its why i do not use any sort of locks at my camp. currently one of the few ways to make yourself wanted
---
Do you have any locks on your doors or purifiers?  I think if someone picks them they become wanted and then your turrets attack them which can cause them to attack your base.  Hopefully someone could confirm this.
---
Lol i got a 3* exterminators wood leg from the vendor and I got a 1* nocturnal knuckles from the queen today! So it’s been a tough day today the least!
---
People say orbital strike beacons for some reason are able to. Huge oversight.
---
Bloodbug Peppersteak! But actually I had an egg on rice.
---
I'll bet that's it, I think I have a lock on one of my purifiers, and turrets right beside it...
---
I think this got downvotes just because it comes off as smug, because I honestly agree but dislike the vindictive nature behind this comment.
---
Like, I *truly, genuinely* hated Fallout 4's story, I've never felt more insignificant in a story than 4, it felt like nothing you did mattered because regardless of your choices you were either a clinically insane good father or a good father. You're allowed to enjoy it, mind you, it's an OK story, but in a medium like a game it came off as really, *really* one dimensional.
---
I will say though, I *also* didn't really like 3's story all that much, as in *that* one I felt shoehorned into either a clinically insane good son, or just a good son. 3's saving grace, as you've said, was the side quests.
---
I just wanted to say I agree, only *sometimes* bethesda can tell great stories, even their environmental story telling is sometimes lacking. Half the time I hear "*environmental storytelling*", the example is like a skeleton in a room with a pistol.
---
For every twenty or so generic skeleton in a room with suicide implications, I feel there's only one real story like the one in 76's vault school where they like, boarded up the school and started eating each other.
---
I personally don't think its necessarily the story telling that brings me to Bethesda games so much as the scale of them and the ambition behind them. It seems every time a new fallout is released it gets critically panned as hot garbage for a bit before it gets the kinks fixed, and usually there are kinks because they always try to do something new. 
---
Fallout 3 *barely ran* on my PS3, and was somehow even less consistent on my PC, and I loved it. It was Bethesda's big transition into real time action combat.
---
New Vegas literally blue screened my PC at the skydiving place outside of goodsprings *every time*, and I still loved it. It was a perfect mix of action combat and respectable story telling, and I loved it (I mostly thank Oblivion for this one)
---
Four really clamped down and made the gunplay actually tight and responsive, and I loved it. My issue here was ironically the direction of their ambition, as it went from respectable story supported by meh gunplay, to subpar story supported by strong gunplay.
---
Idk what message I'm trying to convey at this point, I think its mostly that I'm used to people telling me "*insert most recent fallout title* is trash.", I heard it for three, I heard it for new vegas, I heard it for four, and I most certainly heard it for 76, and the only one I can agree with is probably with four.
---
Yep
---
Been lots of mob kiters now. The griefers are butthurt that they can't grief, so they kite mobs to your place, and stealth out.
---
:D I sure could've used that stuff!
---
Im lvl 97
---
Shit you on pc?
---
I played NMS at launch for hours and hours. Loved it even though no one else did. Got bored of it. After the atlas rises updates I got sucked back in for a bit. Then 76 came out. I tried to play NMS one day when fo76 servers were down for an update and lasted a full 2 minutes before I closed the game bc it was instantly boring.
---
[removed]
---
I think it got downvoted because this sub think Bethesda is immune to criticism
---
It’s definitely possible, I have one of the jumpsuits. The odds are pretty low though, from what I’ve heard :(
---
Best mod imo is furious, especially with a full auto radium. Not sure if AA effects the rad damage though.
---
Ya, constantly crash during the day from eating/drinking. Some type of audio glitch.
---
No longer allowed here. But good find.
---
Would you trade anything for it?
---
Been reading chatter on an upcoming ammo converter.
---
Wait what
---
We've found a witch, may we burn 'er?!
---
You amaze and baffle me. Kudos for the mega effort. What surprises me is most people would rush the start, so they should have allowed pick ups for players that take the time to explore. Start game would have a mini boost with this treasure trove of junk!
---
Nope, I have not reported anybody, until it is obvious. On the other hand, 2* gun with same perks and same price looks like to me duplicated stuff.. If I know how the process I would forward to beth in very first minute..
---
Depends what is it
---
Actually now that I think about it, I saw the guy on the map and he wasn't wanted...   I should have went to the camp to see him do it...  My turrets weren't destroyed which is strange, if it was mobs I would think they could have taken them out, or the guy that messaged me would have killed the mobs.  
---
I guess I'll never know.  Also I thought you got a message if your camp was attacked?
---
Ghouls WERE people. Of course, those persons once was a humans but when you (let's say) cross some border you are stop "suffering" from radiation and it don't hurt your genes anymore but instead of that you start healing. When you noticing it then you know you're a ghoul. As long as radiation can kill you, you are a human (following fallout logic). So.. Yes. Ghouls are people that took really big load of radiation but they are not humans anymore. 
---
In my personal opinion there should be possibility to became one but it have to be : 
---
a) super rare (character need to have "ghoul*" genes gave by game and god of rng).
---
b) when you have around 5% of health and rest of  your hp bar was radiation. Then if you have "ghoul*" genes you will became immediately a ghoul and start healing and loosing rads (if in radiation zone)
---
*name chosen to help with visualization how things above work.
---
Which shouldn't be the case
---
Thanks man!
---
Do you use any chems? I think healing factor has the worst (largest effect, -55% downside) of any mutation.
---
My Bloodied build uses Healing. And a lot of radiation. I had to shoot myself in the foot without armor with an explosive gun to die in water.
---
I want the Rambo explosive arrows. That would make the crossbow worthwhile.
---
So are they are good gun radium and do they trade well?
---
I was about to write something similar to this. 
---
Many players have never had mutations so they are sold cheaper to allow some experience and experimention. Frustrating looking for cheaper mutations on an alt as prices are inflated due to “resellers” who aren’t even keeping them within the community
---
Saves the customer a cap though.
---
Hold the same button you do to grt into build mode
---
Throw junk into your vendor cheap. It’ll fly out the door. Put popular junk at decent prices and you’ll hit cap in no time. The hard part is finding enough stuff to buy to stay under cap while keeping your vendor open.
---
Or at least make emotes that don’t have animation
---
10%.
---
Make 10% of caps spent going to a camp go to that camps owner.
---
Bethesda gets a CAMP sink and players get a tiny revenue bump.
---
That def ain't it, chief, this sub is more than willing to criticize when Bethesda's fucking stupid (bag PR, stupid support ticket networking, bottle PR, really just any major time Bethesda has fucked up). Given 76's rocky release, we've seen it first hand that this sub will crucify the people who made the very thing its about if they're being fucking stupid.
---
The hostility is what I mean, I guarantee you, people here will criticize bethesda but your take on it is *suuuuper* polarizing.
---
In math, purveyor is so expensive, player vendors are better
---
Every server has at least 1 guy with pp jokes or tiddy bar neon signs.
---
Flannel shirt and jeans, raider under armor, and under shirt and jeans are not hard to come by. You should be able to buy some if not all (or the plans to craft) of them at the whitesprings shops.
---
I'm gonna guess either silo or enclave bunker. Maybe Sugar Grove.
---
Why are people downvoting opinions? 
---
This sub has issues if it downvotes an opinion.
---
I want to just play i will never spend my money on Bethesda game's again there trash
---
Na i get you but yeah that what i was wondering kuz they dont carry over the next day, i think we shouldn't be capped at all . haha
---
Green thumb goes on every build of mine - double plants when you pick - at level 4 you can cap out the vendor easily for 1600 a day and food  is always super easy and convenient. 
---
1. billings homestead + corn and razorgrain crops + Green thumb = 500 to 600 caps at the npc vendor. 
---
2. picking every blue flower and blood leaf from the vault to the agricultural center will yeild a crap ton of healing salve which are game changers especially for lower levels. Add chemist for double yeild when crafting the heal salve and you can heal tank a scorchbeast by level ten. (just a guess probably should science that before making that claim.) point being healing salve is amazing for early and mid game. 
---
3. water melons. I am level 230 ish 900 plus hours I still keep green thumb on. I dont cook. I eat water melons for food and water. I don't have to go get wood for boiling water or cooking crap, I only have to pick 10 crops and i get 20 in my inventory, thats seems to be about the closet to perfect amount for me to carry. they spoil over time and generally I run out or only have a couple left by the time they spoil. it also coincides nicely with my junk and scavenge runs. by the time I am low of melons or they're about to spoil I am usually pretty full and need to repair / recover. so it makes return trips nice efficient and stress free. also I have 50 crops at my base, people come steal my melons, thats ok, I always have 10 scattered around my base somewhere.
---
You do realize that stat sheet is based off of total sales and not active player count. The only way you will get active player counts is if the publisher posts them. So of course a free to play game like apex is so high on that chart, because it’s free.
---
3 had one you could buy for your house, it basically cured anything.
---
If you asked me, shit was broken LOL, but in a game like FO76, I think it'd be perfectly fine given diseased enemies seem to just have a fucking 100% chance to give you radworms.
---
Yep. A little while ago I saw a level 3 running around flatwoods while I was attempting to milk cows, and he was gracious enough to die for me. In return I gave him some stimpacks and provided his camp with a few amenities.
---
Blueprints, I don't even bother anymore. They won't select all and having to select EVERY SINGLE ITEM is insane. It is easier just to rebuild if I move.
---
there’s some videos online of dudes 1 shotting sorchbeasts with regular crossbow. If you get the right armor and perks this thing is a FRIGGIN BEAST. But yes some new legendary prefixes and mods would be epic
---
I was so glad that they made The Enclave into this secret shadow government.
---
Okay thanks. That bolstered my hopes to not give up :)
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who picked up on this and/or finds it amusing. Putting lead in kids toys 😂
---
But it only kicks you for a couple seconds not until you get a perk much later.
---
Unless your saying its the same set of words... Then that is news to me!
---
Will we be getting any good posts anytime soon?
---
My problem is the plasma gatlin reload amount.  Sometimes it reloads to 250, sometimes 90, today is even worse, reloads were only bring the weapon up to 31.  Can't kill anything when the gun is going into the reload animation every 5 seconds.
---
Here's hoping it gets fixed soon.
---
You have a lot of time on your hands...
---
I need to know what she has against me. Last time I visited I got a *** stalkers crossbow.
---
I'm online now, I'll add you in a sec.
---
Ok thank you. Was pressing every button to no avail and was getting frustrated I couldn’t figure it out 😂
---
That's literally any sub to ever exist. That's *literally reddit*. There isn't a single sub in existence that doesn't, to an extent, use the downvote button to wash out opinions that clank and butt heads with the general norm.
---
Also just because you say it's objective trash doesn't suddenly make it objective trash, there are still other viewpoints that can totally validate the underwhelming storytelling. I'm like 100% certain this was FO's take on generic triple A gameplay, and it certainly felt so.
---
Happened to me.   Someone brought over two scorchbeasts.   I arrived at my camp and there was a single dead scorchbeast next to my base that they must have killed and the remaining one did a ton of damage.    Repairs weren't to bad all things considered but I did learn one lesson.   No more frog habitats.   Those habitats were a real pain to replace so I could rebuild the base.
---
yes specific resources for ammo of course for all the other unknowns 100 is my general rule of thumb, for me I keep more than 100 of radioactive material. and aluminium, I take the power plant shops for fusion cores, often I build nuclear generators and nuclear waste and aluminium are the 2 things that have vexed me in the past. so I will let those go to 200 but 200 is just 100 twice so I am still 100. :) I double up on the 100 if the vexation is strong.
---
why is this game missing features from fallout 4? Is it to add them into the atom store or something?
---
Yes! I'd be down for recurve and compound bows. They could even add in some shooting ranges across the map.
---
Farm outside west tek. Takes me about 45 minutes to hit 1400 daily limit.
---
I genuinely would have never known what it was until I saw this, so thank you.
---
...what?
---
#I was so glad that they made The Enclave into this secret shadow government.
---
Farm the mutants outside West Tek?
---
But junk is so common.. And ammo weighs so little.. I dont get why you cant be good with 2 or 3 types if you give up things like weight reduction and 2x harvest ect. Im new so i could be totally wrong but it seems all you need is a max card for what ever weapon. 55 is 10+ points after 3 special is maxed... What am i missing?
---
I'd launch more nukes but i hate silos. Everything looks the same i get lost very easily
---
Sell purified water is an easy way easy on.  Also weapons though scrapping them can be more valuable.  Then you bulk the junk and sell it.
---
They scrap into stuff. Fur is ballistic fiber!
---
Crap. I'm building up my 5.56, .308, and shotgun ammo to sell and there might be a bug that only gives you a miniscule fraction of the value you set? Not good. First I heard of this
---
Yup
---
They have been since Fallout 1. What are you on about?
---
Selling junk/aid/ammo to players
---
Is it really a Chinese knockoff if the original is also made in China?
---
Enclave vendor only.  No plans unfortunately.
---
They are literally top tier in pvp. My BE laser rifle, with beam splitter and full auto gets to 300+ damage on paper, and I believe, now I don't fully understand myself, but the beam splitter makes 5 projectiles from the one, it is also I've heard, a hitscan weapon, instead of projectile, so much more accurate, and faster, at range. You can kill people outside of the games rendering limits of distance. It kills everyone, even sentinels in a fraction of a second, and it's fire rate because of auto is ridiculous.
---
If the "random" loot generator works like other games then yes every player is assigned an ID, but that ID is factored against the complete date, time, and other things and has no bearing on on chance. Every player probably has the same chance of getting any individual item to drop but they have higher statistical chances of that item dropping at specific unknown days of the week/month or seconds of the day. Making more characters does noting to increase your odds. You will never be able to identify that you have a "lucky" character.
---
They are decent, I bought a TSE one before the nerf for 2.5k. They aren't sought after, BUT with the amount of bloodied builds, they are actually amazing for PvP. Nothing shits on a sliver of health like a chunk of radiation damage.
---
No it's a diff set of words. But it still seems quicker than removing all the duds
---
Have my upvote, you're just getting downvoted by salty explosive laser rifle users who want to keep their boomsticks they bought on eBay. The reason is laser rifle hits for around 100, split into 8 beams is around 800 dmg per shot. Combine that with the fire rate of auto and you're dealing several thousand dps with insane range.
---
Power is funny in fallout.  Some things need direct attachments, but to make building things easier, some things like lights just need power “nearby”.  You can experiment with wires and connectors to see how close it needs to be.  There isn’t a special connector you have to use... any power connector will work.
---
This is fucking incredible.
---
I just use the thumbs up.
---
Not a bug, but rather a game breaking combination of effects happening. Hitscan weapon, so accurate as hell at any distance. can be converted to full auto, beam splitter for 5 projectiles. Top weapons in PvP right now. They shit all over even BE handmades and the like.
---
The things destroying right now are the gatling plasmas and laser rifles.
---
prolly not intentional .. I don't think anyones that old enough to know whom of which you speak
---
I would also like to join on this, need it done as well. Is that cool?
---
I like the following me emote. I wish there was a wait emote too
---
It has 90 rad resist on it. Worth grinding the event for badges
---
I’m gonna use this to make the brotherhood blimp from fallout 4
---
The annoying thing is everyone having them in pvp lol.
---
He has suggested it’s against the rules to trade with fo76.
---
Use the other subreddits.
---
With the nerf, everyone is easy pickins now.
---
at level 4 you can get daily caps stash naked simply by choosing green thumb perk. pick every flower from vault to flatwoods sell everything.follow the river from slocums joe to hillfolk hotdogs, sell everything. follow the west side river from hillfolk hotdogs to billings homestead, pick corn and razorgrain patch. that's the easiest way to cap out of sells for the day on any character that I have found so far.
---
Maybe vintage Nukashine? I'm about to log in and I'll give it a try
---
Bethesda stated at one point they were going to replace the explosive effect on energy weapons with s new effect at some point. It will happen just a question of when.
---
Yeah we are having trouble getting into the down state though, anyone have an idea?
---
Run some stealth melee, ghouls would hit you very rarely and you could still one-shot them without bloodied damage.
---
I have been saving up 1 off each bobblehead since the beta in hopes that a display case would come someday.

Late answer, but the tests are part of the actions to earn merit badges in Archery, Hunting, First Aid, etc...

I do outside of west tek and Huntersville.

You Sure you haven't just unchecked it under Data and Quests ?

You think that's bad you should try out the automatic tesla rifle, guaranteed to bug out after around 10-15 minutes of shooting enemies

Any alcohol that you can brew that turns vintage.. I drank a vintage lead Bellini, and it worked. I guess it just had to have "vintage" in the name
---
I honestly prefer it for the game it is, but I understand what you mean. It wouldn't work in ESO, but here it just kinda fits imo. If it bugs you, I'd recommend server hopping some. I know some nights I'll log in and never see a soul, then the next I'm bumping into a new wastelander every few minutes.
---
Yeah I ended up getting it but thank you it was super annoying to find
---
Ok
---
I have logged in a couple times just today where my camp spot is taken and I have not had a price reset.    This isn't even counting the numerous times in the past week this has happened.  If its a bug then it seems to be selective.
---
You are going to get mixed opinions on this question. Personally I find this game super fun and enjoyable bugs and all. The game has its "are you kidding me?" Moments but that is overshadowed by the many "that shit was cool/fun!" Moments. Friends make the game a whole lot better. With more dlc yet to come I believe this game is becoming a greater game than when It released.
---
Anything that allows you to ferment it twice to add the vintage label on the drink.
---
vodke, rum, whisket(my fav), beer etc .. anything of these new age fruitloop drinks made by the robot and his ridiculous quest is not vintage my good sir/madam
---
No worries, took me 150 levels to figure it out, haha
---
If you want the best stuff, you have to trade with others in this game.

I have pretty bad game stutter often. (I think stutter is the term people use for it?) Lots of mini-freezes with unresponsive controls. Started with the patch that introduced the free range event. Xbox One X.
---
Ok, watch out for missiles and nukes. Those can add up
---
How much dog food do you eat that you need to manufacture it?
---
Yes. 1400 from vendors.
---
Useful ones go for 50 caps and I have tons of em, others I sell for 20.
---
Blueprints are more for smaller segments that are complicated to remake, but not stable for whole houses.
---
Thanks, I'm only level 12. Didn't know that
---
it's bad cause it's buggy and glitchy and repeatative annoying and filled with creepy people .. it's good because of creepy people
---
you can build your CAMP which is limited but limited enough make a penthouse for ur bunnies .. events are frequent and stupid most of are only done for a 'rare' which never appears and bosses ... well ... no but yes .. i guess you should get the game .. like I did then you'll have more concrete answers
---
I don’t use them, but sometimes have them in my vending machines.
---
There are easily 30-40 cap stashes in the forest and ash heap alone.  Do a search for known cap stashes and level up your cap collector and equip fortune finder.
---
checked every menu, including the miscellaneous sections
---
Whatever you say pal. Grow up.
---
What happened to returning the favor? You just left after all that? What the hell man
---
you aren't missing anything. I simply explained what works best for me. I hate inventory management more than most people, so if you want to use 2 separate weapon types and manage more than one ammo type and you're ok with the bit of extra inventory management by all means go for it. no one knows what make's you happy more than you. FOR ME and me alone I find I am much happier when I specialize and reduce inventory management in the game. I bring this up to you because it was not a factor I considered at lower levels. mistakes were made points were wasted ;P it all worked out in the end though.
---
New Vegas had great ammo crafting mechanics.
---
After joining many events, i finally ran my own today. I normally act as one or more conduits but everyone that came seemed more than happy to rush to them. Killed that sucker in no time.
---
My only regret is that I kept on reviving players. It's automatic and I forget that others might be waiting for the chance to complete that quest. Sorry....
---
I mean it is not impossible but it is improbable because names are also probably given numerical values on to of your player ID and a lot of other things, but then again it is often better to be lucky than good.
---
Never mind, it's the server. I activated Nvidias system that shows frames and I have solid 60FPS when everything lags and speed test gave 94Mbit/s as internet speed
---
Private servers would be a loot-fest. Lately, finding anyplace not already looted is next to impossible. The sheer number of  returning players is causing stability issues on top of all the new content.
---
Looks like it’s about to pop out of the smoke and cause some ruckus for some Romulans,...er, super mutants.
---
Only if they come at you from behind.
---
*Giggity*  😂
---
Xbox, pc,or playstation?
---
Do we know if there is a connection between the anatomical-skeleton factory in The Mire and autopsy board game bones?
---
Members ... When love is gone, there's always justice.
---
And when justice is gone, there's always force…
---
Ah, PC. My bad should have stated that
---
The guy who hid flame jets behind disposable half-height wood walls was pretty brilliant. You could combine this with a spikes pit for extra effect.
---
I think those are just explosion turrets. Doubt they would be TSE. But yeah they do lots of damage to me but I want them in my camp.
---
Doesn't happen every time to me - but often enough.
---
 Usually when I am doing sometime important or just finished.
---
Have to restart the game and hope everything is still there.
---
have any other mounted plans been found?
---
Damn, sorry man I'd help but I'm on xbox.
---
I want an vampiric explosive gat with increased fire rate. That would be my dream heavy gun.
---
I like Final Render and JuiceHead
---
Oxhorn is the lore master and I like Norespawn for building.
---
Captain noob. You won’t be sorry
---
I do not know, because I have yet to find that location.
---
Options
---
Thats hot
---
They are used to make mods for the Shepard' s Crook. You get the plans from finishing the Free Range event.
---
It's like a roll of the dice. You dont know what you're going to get. It's like killing a 3 star legendary and getting a rolling pin. But, sometimes you get lucky and get something nice. Just have to look at it this way. 
---
Lastly, not everyone has high end gear to sell or even care about it enough to grind for it.
---
Sorry, xbox.
---
when i sell i only put up legendary items or rare outfits
---
that said when im shopping i only go to camps near whitesprings, Berkley, or west tek now because they probably have a few leg's
---
I had a guy come to my camp because I have vending machines up just to ask me if he can rez me in water because my camp is next to water. I didn’t have a mic so I thumbs up’d and ran to a cliff and jumped into shallow water so he could rez me. Feels good man. Lucky for me I have friends that play so it was easy when I needed it but I was glad to help someone get their backpack.
---
Yeah I use to watch a lot of Juicehead when fallout 4 was at its peak I’ll check him out again
---
someone downvoted lol
---
ITS A JOKE BRUH
---
Yes and no. It's like an orgy - first served, first come. When enough people respond, the flare vanishes, and no more people can join in. It's not meant to pull an entire server, just get 1-3 people to come help you with whatever. Do you really want 28 people descending on you?
---
Again, look at Division 2. It's out now. It works fine. A call comes in, you look at what the help is needed with, and where the call comes on the map. And you respond or not.
---
Juice head
---
Oxhorn totally forgot about him I’ll give him a revist
---
I have an BE lever and I’m super hood lol
---
You should have thrown hands
---
Yeah, there is. I worked it out.
---
The drink should say vintage in the title ie: vintage tick blood tequila
---
In my experience, If you're going to the forest, ash heap or toxic valley the goods tend to be on the lower end. The mire and the bog tend to have better, higher level and higher quality goods. The Devide is a crap shoot. 😂😂
---
Love his videos.
---
You don't know what I mean by broken. You place a wall that wants to turn around backwards and end up tearing half your structure and building it differently. An object won't place because it's floating. But you exit and reenter the build menu and it goes just fine. Now with the latest patch when you move your house is no longer blueprinted in one piece. Every individual wall, floor and roof panel is a blueprint and it becomes one giant jigsaw puzzle. That's broken...
---
Good day this is captain noob and today I have...
---
I think the theory is right to an extent. This is the reason that I am not spending my scrip each day but saving up to 1000. My rule now is to buy 1 2* weapon and if it sucks jump servers. Then repeat. If I get a good prefix or explosive I double down and buy 3*s.
---
Nawh. I run around with a lead lined and a high capacity and the just swap between the two
---
Oof
---

---
welcome to life.  its full of disappointments.
---
What
---
Vampires Sytinger..... Or bloodied or two shot explosive syringe
---
Well if not then yeah it’s selective. Also I should mention the first day player vending came out, I found a world after already placing my vending machines and putting things up for sale, and once I found a new world where my camp was taken, and I searched for a new one, my camp was completely gone. And yes, I closed the app, restarted it numerous times. Server hopped. All of it. My camp never appeared even with there being no camp in site where my camp should’ve been.
---
Norespawns, final render and jug fire build videos
---
Condition.
---
Me too.
---
power armor is outpaced by legendary armor in the end game. I am level 230 and use power armor for the jump jets and targeting HUD, the yellow and black prototype paint job makes me happy in the pants as well. by pairing that up with a laser gatling I am indestructable in pve even by the queen, nothing in the game can hurt me. 
---
end game pvp is all about who gets that one shot\\hit off first, damages can reach into the thousands. no armor or health pool will save you from a fully maxed out pvper who gets the first shot off. SO I turned my vangaurd set into scrip to save the carry weight and reduce inventory clutter. I just wear a shirt and jeans under the power armor now. In PVE I can tank the queen and the entire bog of critters, but a player can still one shot me. makes perfect sense in a world where a dude with a hammer can impart more kinetic energy than a railgun. 
---
I like power armor because to me fallout universe IS power armor and guns and lasers. also its nice to get in and out of and not have all that extra stuff to be wearing and going around in the craft bench or at the vendor. when I get out of my power armor I only have to avoid scrapping or selling my tshirt and slacks. 
---
the down side of the power armor is also getting in and out of it to go into beds, instruments and work benches, the loading animation can get annoying af after awhile. I get around this by doing all non power armor crap in one run when I come back to camp to recover. oh but when I forget something OMG grrr.
---
I’d be into this if it was a very, very rare plan.  Mostly because literally everyone would have them and wouldn’t make it cool.
---
Watch out for the glowing pee
---
Or letting us plant in flat areas away from any existing object instead of "object is floating" or "Nothing is selected" or "Object is intersecting with an existing object"
---
Comic relief.
---
The lead lined only has 30 capacity btw
---
Can I find a drink in the wild and ferment it again? Also, how long does it take to ferment?
---
Still bugged, eeyup. Just tried to do these thinking they might be fixed by now.
---
It has been proven multiple times that if a cap is at charelston start. The vendor bot sapwns under the railroad bridge and the walks up to the tacks by the round fill up station to the west of the station. If ya don't believe. Look on u tube and be in lightened.
---
Happened to me and my friend once so we shot the hell out of it
---
Where is this and how did it get nuked? Seriously though, your CAMP looks cool
---
Only stuff certain liquors you craft yourself are going to be able to go to vintage status I think the ones that can are the rock blood tequila and lead champagne alongside of nuka shine
---
Yeah, but I don't think everyone is experiencing those issues, I know I'm not, and I just moved my base. Only floating issue I've had was plants that wanted to float or sink, but I've built in that location before and I think it's just a thing there. 0 issues building, entire camp was blueprinted.
---
I usually end up doing double duty and revive other conduits while being a conduit. I had to stop reviving people with booze because the animation takes so much longer... kept getting me killed.
---
Its a lot of fun, i can shit on the squatch in 10 hits or less with a PF and take noticable chunks of health from the imposter. The queen just eats it and  pisses radiation on me. But you gotta get the perks, weapons and unyielding armor fo it to be at its best. Im still plagued by weight problems and im trying to rely on as little weight perks so i can put damage instead
---
Aren't they basically useless other than crits, if you use dense and fireproof?
---
I’ve teleported onto the event &amp; the last 3 times it wouldn’t activate
---
Is the Shepard’s crook just used for herding Brahmin and a low level weapon?
---
This bug is fucking awful.
---
I don't think camp location plays much of a role. I've seen crap right next to Whitesprings or wildly priced meh stuff, which is worse. And, I've gotten some great deals in the Forest. It just depends on the player.
---
Saddest is when you hit the jackpot and start buying up only to have the seller log off (because you've put them at max caps or whatever) before you could buy everything you wanted.
---
Looking for help as well. Will be on later tonight. 
---

The limit keep a people with piles of duped weapons from cashing in on the vendor. I’d rather it stays imposed.
---
You never know. She's still working today and is still a well-known in artist circles. It could have even been the voice actor's idea. It's almost spot on.
---
has he got it yet?
---
I couldn't do it to him he roasted me and it hurt
---
Indubitably.
---
I'm a fallen brother
---
Yes got it today FINALLY.  Took me 2 rerolls.
---
You still need to get this done?
---
I need to do it still would like a hand
---
I do yeah. Kinda got screwed out of helping
---
i only sell legendary stuff, if its not sold i lower the price up to 3 times. after that if its not a god roll i turn any unsold items into scrip
---
Let me switch characters. Gt?
---
He insulted me too and i whacked him for insulting my honor
---
Add RoundyRoundy and I’ll help you out
---
First get your hard bargain perk card maxed. Then go to the mothman statue collect all of the mothman eggs laying underneath it. Then walk down to where the river is and grab the rest. Make them into omelettes and sell them to the vendor for nine caps each. Also get chemist and super duper perks, you can make radaway and other chems when you get the plans and make a ton of them and sell them. Do all of that along with a west tek run you'll be at your daily max easy
---
I’ll join you
---
Mikeeparks
---
Honestly I'd just love a 'no mic' emoji. I usually just use 'confused' lol
---
I’ll invite you. My camp is on a lake. Return the favor?
---
Thanks man. Do you need it too?
---
You have it backwards. Only some of the new drinks can get vintage.
---
 Rifle gaming
---
Alright guys pack it  up nobody's topping this.
---
I only sell Legendary stuff that's level 45-50, two-star, and that people would actually want. Everything else gets turned into scrip.
---
Hey you! Now's our chance to escape, won't get another one
---
Id like to get some help too and will be glad to pay or return the favor...
---
GT enchiladajones
---
Nope I’m good
---
Anatomical skeleton factory?!?
---
I think the build cap is actually quite good now.  I have like 9 turrets (2 missile, 2 heavy laser, 4 heavy mg, 1 spotlight) along with 4 vendors, one of each crafting, etc.  Point is it used to be just 2 turrets ate your entire budget, so its quite good now
---
All the Nukashine locations have empty bottles Nukashine at them. It's a nice touch.
---
this
---
Riflegaming
---
I got it as a gift and started playing not really understanding that it's really an MMO. took me awhile to figure that out because you don't see very many other people. If you're looking for friends add me same name in the game.
---
There are a ton of straight jackets in Ft. Defiance. 40 caps a piece.
---
You’ll use 12 of your 15 strength points just to equip the damage and weight reduction/reload perks for shotguns. You could put those last three points into unarmed or melee, but then you won’t have enough points the perk that gives your melee armor penetration.
---
I use shotguns/heavy, and I recommend using a melee as your backup weapon. Shotguns shells are relatively expensive, and heavy weapons can be clunky. Having a quick weapon you can whip out to kill trash mobs is really helpful for this build. But I don’t recommend actually putting points into melee AND shotguns/heavy at the same time. You just don’t have room for it.
---
Love the idea, but some safe guards need to be put in place. Wouldn't be fair to downvote someone for not having what you're looking for, even if everything else is priced fairly or cheaper than market value.
---
I love it I love it I love it I love it. No more wasting stimpaks when I’m not actually in a fight, it all heals itself, with class freak 3 Chen effect reduction goes down to 13%, easily negated by perks
---
Lvl 160 on main 120 on alt 1 and 50 on alt 2.
---
On my main (PA/hvy/shotgun) I average 3 level ina 4 hour play "day". Fist hour is running any of the high level events, awol, uranium, free range, dropped connection,hord (mire,bog,divide) then I do west tech, ws and every so often one silent night.
---
If I'm really feeling frisky I server hop till I see a "good" server with alot of high lvla on it then I run all 3 silos (if available) and nuke the queen each time.
---
The only xp boosts that I use is rested.
---
  
---
My alts are not as far into their builds but I generally do the normal grind (first part of my day. And I'll then join friend in doing whatever they need done.
---
As to leveling. If you know how and really want to grind it's events &gt;mobs&gt;quests.
---
Hope this helps.
---
I'm on PC and will be more than happy to take ya along with me as I do my daily routine. Just send me an invite
---
I will never clame a workshop since it's sucks for xp and there's nothing I need from anyone them. I craft my own cors to 200% when I remember to put on the extra aor food. If not they craft out to 120%. And I usually Cary 20 on me.
---
There is a visual bug right now where if someone buys ammo from you and they already have some of that ammo it will show as the total ammount of ammo the buyer has as the sale.
---
For example if they buy has 500 ammo and buys 100 from you the sale will show he bought 600 ammo (500 already owned + 100 bought) even though he only bought 100.
---
I see. i like survival aspects and what would i do with this room in my stash! So i dont mind crafting up food and ammo before i adventure out. 
---
I know you cant breakdown ammo but can you sell it to any vendor? Right now im running 3 pistols (which would prob drive you nuts lol) but aside from .44 .45 and 308 i have no use for this other i find all over. 
---
May transition to a true sniper but then ill have to keep 1 pistol for close up... Maybe 2. And a few nades.. I just cant help my self
---
I play a couple hours per day max, about 300 hours total since game release. I had no problem accumulating 1000 scrip in the week leading up to the legendary vendor's debut. So the first day I cash in my scrip for 10 - 3 star legs. OK so that's 400 worth of scrip, three days to cash in if I don't collect a single other legendary. Well, I like to keep playing, and I legitimately continue to collect legendary weapons I'd like to trade for scrip. So even with my modest game time per day I'm finding legendaries faster than I can scrap them out for scrip.
---
150 per day isn't enough.
---
They use a Bloodied Explosive Lever Action Rifle, and they think it makes them “super hood lol”. Not sure how to translate that last part.
---
Both do, the swimmer one counts as 2 if you do it first
---
Thanks I'll go there now.
---
my wife is like that, she picks up everything that isn't nailed down. i am much more selective. when we quest together, i am usually waiting for her to finish looting....
---
its south from whitespring station. i often connect on nuked servers (so the camp dont take damage but i take lots of RADs :P
---
Forget the ship.. he figure out how to make round bases!
---
Yeah 3k is cheap when it's easy to get 1400 a day.
---
I think it didnt let me res you because i dont have any normal stims only super and diluted
---
We asked with mics and everyone seemed to be done? Sorry didn't realise you still needed it.
---
Whitespring. It’s called the dome statue, talk to my boi Pendington, he’ll hook you up
---
It would be great if the bumped it to 350- 500. It’s infuriating building up a surplus of legendary weapons and having to wait 24 odd hours to get rid of it.
---
Grab that super sledge and follow me!
---
Not in my experience lol.
---
Thats my plan im at 16k rn
---
speaking of, anyone know how to get the longshoreman outfit?
---
hey can i help? i need to do this also!! im on pc if anyone sees this
---
I debated getting it the other day at 12k but didn’t. Definitely would have snatched it up for 3k
---
You forgot to help out the other guy
---
It’s like starving yourself to death just because parasites will steal the stuff you eat. Track down and ban dupers and delete duped items, there’s no other way.
---
Theres a random warehouse which has a terminal which describes how to de-bone a human and prepare it for those hang-up skeletons you have in classrooms.
---
Agreed, it is super easy to hit the 150 scrip limit with just minimal grinding. I'm ok with the 1000 scrip limit total,but the 150 a day trade in needs to be removed.

---
Ooh. Fascinating! Is it a marked location?
---
Oh ok, thanks for the clarification
---
Very true it wouldn't be fair. I know my vending camp would have 1* lol I just have some common plans and some rare for a good price but dont manage it at all is just not for me. But I love visiting player vending.
---
But kinda sad when I see a serum selling for 1500 and next closest vending selling same for 200 caps
---
Nope it's in lights. Under lamps.
---
I think pack rat is kinda bunk... I mean your going to break down junk and store it right away right? Feels like the ones that reduces aid and food. I keep way too much of that on me all the time. Plus chems sell pretty well so i stop when im near by and sell most of it off.
---
Then I'm glad my first roll with the Purveyor was an anti-armor gatling plasma!
---
its new, ppl just trying to get that one weapon they haven't been able to get yet, or those hard to find supplies
---
I got you, it’s a glitch that Bethesda doesn’t seem to be working on. 
---
You can use emotes while sitting. Get out your camera, make sure you have it in your hand before sitting down. Sometimes you need to look through the camera once before sitting, but with camera in hand you can now use the emote wheel freely. Enjoy! I do this all the time when I’m trading at my shop from my vendor window
---
I usually go lower than 100 for some stuff but have used this rule to keep my stash under control. The exception is adhesive... I have like 260 at the moment and can’t make myself get rid of any, or stop picking it up. To many bad experiences of running out.
---
But im not dropping my water... 20 at all times and its hotkeyd so a quick 3 tap and that meter is gone for a while ☺
---
Unarmed melee is the most powerful melee you can get for the perk costs for non power users,
---
unarmed costs 3 points incisor costs 3 and martial artist costs 3  incisor and martial artist I consider must haves for melee builds which means if i use anything else but unarmed i end up one point short. 
---
However with unarmed i put 2 points into starched genes and get twisted muscles and talons, that gives you max damage melee using only 11 perk cards. unarmed weps do not work in power armor so low and mid level you can run into gear walls and have to step back and grind some to get past them. 
---
As far as ammo selling you have to use the new player vendor station in your camp.
---
See exact opposite experience for me. Anytime the SBG ISS or CT popped up the whole lobby was there. Did SBQ 3 times in a row tonight.
---
Just make non-combat perks passive. Things related to crafting, lockpicking hacking, fast traveling and etc.  
---
ANd for crafting/modding just use SPECIAL check:
---
Game as it is: you need to equip lvl 3 Gunsmith and lvl 2 Science do mod some weapon
---
How it should be: you must have lvl 3 gunsmith, lvl 2 science (not necesarily equiped) **and** have at least 5 intelligence (3+2)
---
Not sure on what your weight should be but if you truly believe it's a bug. A few things to check or do.....
---
Make sure armor isn't broken, otherwise won't matter if you have pocketed.  
---
Make sure no diseases. Sometimes its bugged and won't show if you have one. If you can spare a disease cure, try taking one. 
---
Any mutations that give negative strength? 
---
Or perhaps did you have a mutation before like marsupial (which adds carry weight) and now it's cured.
---
Can unequip all armor and perk cards, log out and back on and re-equip everything. See if that fixes it.
---
Oh cool.  Thanks
---
Hmm, I spent way too long trying to find it there the other day. I guess I’ll try again.
---
Commie Wacker
---
Nice write up! Way more thought went into it than mine :) Mine was just a drunken rambling that blew up.  I definately agree that they should be available in game as a quest, it would be a huge missed opportunity if they didn't. But I still think we have to assume they will likely monatize skins / voices via ATOM shop (again, it would be a missed revenue stream if they didn't)
---
Also the assaultron sheepsquatch impersonator, that quest even ahd the robot modification platform in it.
---
Well done Sir and/or Madam and/or Other! &lt;3
---
Thought this was the Vault Boy
---
If you’re on PC there’s a mod that adds exactly this
---
I agree, but for the sake of it I'll play advocate here.
---
What about me and my bloodied build? I'm operating with 19% of my Max HP. At best. Am I expected to just tape down my stimpack hotkey. Assuming i have infinite stims, it doesn't even make sense when the bot double fists me to dead in one lunge, skipping the downed state entirely almost every time.
---
The absolute cleanest fights I see are when I'm not juggling conduit or aggro and can just shove my 50cal up her ass and hold the trigger w/o worrying about stims.
---
Aww shit. I wanna make Serenity now...
---
Or......increase it by 10 so we can trade 4 3* at a rip
---
WHAT?!?! roflmao sorry but WOW...
---
No problem
---
It’s does, but I actually think the bot spawns much easier by lady Janet’s soft serve. Back when I was searching I believe he spawned almost double the hops.
---
At a minimum i would prefer the limit to be a weekly maximum instead of a daily cap.
---
We need more of those tests, THanks for your reports! i can finally scrap my Endangerol and free some space on my stah
---
I know :( i couldn't believe it. At least i still have the code. I guess we'll have to run through the silo again after restocking on ammo.
---
Nah. Saddest is when you finally find something decent, but the seller put it at 25k.
---
It’s like that game Moonlighter now. Half gathering and half selling for profit.
---
I’ve got my camp in the Forest specifically to sell to low level characters so I have lots of cheap meds and maxed out low level weapons and armor. I tried selling some good level 5 legendaries but higher level players keep buying the damn things, presumably to scrap them.
---
You can use the left/right arrow keys for fine adjustments.
---
I’ve never seen a dead vendor and have been playing since release. That’s so weird lol
---
i agree with white fox shotgun needs to be fully specced in. if youre gonna mix mele and ranged I would go with unarmed 3 incisor 3 martial artist 3 plus the talons and twisted muscle mutation and 2 points in starched genes. then as ranged I would go sniper or commando. maybe even explosives, up to you what flavor you like. also defensive perks - you can go for resistances or you can go for stealth 0- thats a completely different set of choices.
---
I took off traveling pharmacy the other day. Went up to well over 600 weight. Quickly put it back on and pretended I didn’t see anything.
---
Well I hope you have a complete WIN this time around... still SMH at this
---
Much appreciated!
---
Are you looking at what your strength stat is listed at on the stats tab or just counting your perk cards? Is the armor broken? (I'm assuming the armor in question is +1 strength and deep pocketed, otherwise your calculation about +15 cw is off anyway.) Do you have any diseases? Are you addicted to anything? Do you have mutations that negatively affect strength?
---
That would be awesome
---
Same thing for me, I found a bunch of legendary enemies since the update, compared to previous.
---
Ah, great, because mine was affected too. It would be good to hear how this shakes out. Do you have a link to your thread there?
---
It used to be a round 280 or 290. Im not sure about diseases i did have one that gave negative stats to aiming but my game did start to lag through out the fight with queen so i might have missed it if i did catch another one, so ill have to look around for another disease cure since i dont have one
---
Same. Just seems too hard so I appreciate those with the patience to do it.
---
That's absolutely brilliant!  You must have so much patience to make something that cool.
---
Really? I can toss them in my trade station thingy and people seem to be buying them.
---
So far I done two sbq after the vending update and so far it felt like everyone drop what they were doing to go fight it
---
This is way less productive than it used to be though. I was getting tons of caps pre-nerf but afterwards I basically gave up cap stash runs
---
If no one has helped you,  I can tomorrow afternoon. Got stuff to attend to in the morning
---
I haven't run into that, but if I really want something, I just look on the market or bazaar. Of course, I never really want much.
---
I completely forgot about renaming stuff. That can help a bunch.
---
Good on you. If you're gonna sell common crap, at least have the decency to mod and repair it up, right?
---
Or come buy disease cure at my shop for 10 caps a pop 👉🏻😎👉🏻
---
As someone with a medic character. I'd be all over this.
---
I’m lvl 136 or something, I lost track. But I’ve got around 40 unused levels, lol
---
This works
---
Challenge accepted and this would make it very fun and cool to be one of those who have to work hard to get it.
---
Responder bot is both rare and has a timer. He just dies on his own after a bit anyway. I wonder if that’s what happened to OP.
---
Some of the prices I see out there are laughably high. I feel bad for any sucker that buys from them.
---
I would like this idea. Too many time I have wasted caps and went to camps that were selling items for absurdly high prices.
---
You would be surprised my friend
---
Fact #2. Fuck Yao Guais
---
More broken doesn’t matter anymore, they removed overrepair bonuses
---
Can we get neon letters that don't take 500 hours to line up
---
Not since the last patch.
---
Doesn’t count on this sub, but thanks! That was confusing and fun. Explosive shotguns are the easiest way to die on purpose or on accident in fallout 76. I had to overcome my own healing factor mutation when I did it.
---
O.o how did you guess?
---
Perfect, I was waiting on mine to ferment
---
 Im looking at the perk chart for strength , ill take a picture and ill try to upload it in a minute.
---
My chest piece isn't legendary but i does say that it gives extra carryweight , but it does +15 to carryweight and oddly enough it hasn't been broken or damaged since i have a perk that fixes armor every once in awhile.
---
Im not addicted to anything and no mutations.
---
Ill try to upload a picture of everything .
---
I invited and messaged you.
---
Fasnacht stuff sells for a pretty penny. Just because you wouldn't pay it doesn't mean others wouldn't. You know nothing.
---
Fact #3 Yao Guai typically spawn in packs 2 to 3 occasionally you’ll stumble upon just 1 or if your unlucky enough you’ll get mauled to death by 4
---
I love that it feels like Fallout normally does, but then I can go to someone else’s camp or work with others on events if I want. I usually have voice chat disabled, but once in a while it’s cool. I also play with my brothers so we trade a bunch of stuff we’ve been collecting for each other and do events together.
---
I solo the silos great for restocking, but q'n the nuke is a pain after having to get the codes, nothing is close to "real" but try to burn the world again and they made close as it can be?!?!?
---
I uh gotta disagree with you buddy lol I've seen people sell em for 500 caps easy
---
It doesn't affect budget, maybe you have to many things stored
---
Don't look at the perk chart. Look at the stats tab.
---
Can confirm Janet’s is a much better place to server hop - side note I also found a new spawn for him today on the road in front of the gorge junkyard
---
Well what does it say when people get better shit from vendors then the scorchbeast queen?
---
+1 for excellent spelling
---
Is that third legendary effect even worth it? Why not go for 2 star? The best effects are on those first 2. Or do you really need that +1 agility effect...
---
Enough so that you never have to worry about food again...
---
No it was Some dip shit who snuck up like no one was watching him, turned invisible, then swiped him with his gauntlet. I’ve gotten the vendor about 15 times and have had him die on his own in anywhere from 2 minutes to an hour! Very unpredictable on its own. Also I have had a few D bags that have shot him as well tho. You never know what type of player will show up I guess.
---
No.
---
Fact #4: If you die by a pack of Yao Guais and had an ass ton of Junk you are basically fucked.
---
Wow ! I've hated every floating camp I've ever seen but I love this.
---
Once you get a bunch of caps and start doing nuke zones, buying a cheap-to-produce mutation serum recipe is helpful. Can sell each one for 500 caps (or a bit less to stay under the 1400 daily limit). Just costs ultracite, stable flux and common materials depending on recipe. 
---
Look at required components when deciding which recipe to buy. Whitesprings nuke zones produce a TON of fluorescent flux and some yellowcake, and SBQ zones produce a lot of violet and some crimson. Cobalt seems to be less common.
---
Yeah you should be worried...you cheat you get banned simple as that
---
If I see the the masks that cheap I’m buying them all and flipping them for 300. That’s still a steal from a week ago when vending first started. 
---
The common clothes and non-legendary stuff I agree with.  Why would anyone spend more than 30 caps on a level 30 shotgun.
---
What are you talking about? As I said I'm not cheating.
---
&gt;having an extra weapon as back up is always a good idea even if you sarent specced for it but trying to max out shotgun and melee
---
I dont use fusion cores. So I sell them how I get them, which is usually used. I have yet to find a full fusion core
---
ill add you :) if i cant find someone by then id be more than happy!
---
I don't think they're ever at vendors. You just have to grind the plan spawns and hope. Savage Divide and Mire spawns should have the best chances, while the Ash Heap should also be possible.
---
Platform?
---
It is at least better than people with camps that are selling items for absurdly high prices. I saw one dude selling wood armor for 1000 caps, all plans and recipes 500 more caps than their worth, one star legendary guns for 5k, and stimpaks for 100 caps a piece. The guy was mid 200's in level, so he should know better on how pricing works. Those type of people are the ones where I will search for a switch if they have one that is tied to their vending and turn that shit off.
---
Do you even English?
---
The robot is super fragile, even the radiation damage from the water can kill him in a minute.  I tried to hang out there once while waiting for people to come over, and he just died standing there.
---
Fact #5: Dusky Yao Guai are just assholes
---
Can u throw a gernade in there to pop it out
---
It depends more per region than by level. Aside from horde events (which almost always have a 3* boss), you will usually come across legendaries by pure luck, and some formula based on the enemy type and level. In my experience, super mutants and ghouls are the most likely to be legendary while scorched and mole miners are the least likely. In the cranberry bog, mire, and parts of the savage divide you will start seeing legendaries on a regular basis
---
Well, about a month ago he decided to go rogue for some reason and snipe the rare mobs without telling anyone. It created a lot of drama since there are hundreds of people on the server who do these hunts and it was a well organized thing. I think he was going through some tough personal issues. Anyways since the entire hunting community hated him after doing this, he decided to switch servers.
---
Every gun that you see that drops people really fast is most likely an explosive legendary weapon. Others may have mentioned this as well, but it’s even more deadly if it’s a two shot legendary on top of the explosive. I think the ideal 3 star is those two plus anti armor.
---
I’ll be on in a few minutes to help out with the SB and hang out with the body.
---
What sort of junk do you suggest? Normally I break it down and put it in the machine in bulk.
---
Quad auto tesla, but I've had my AAE Handmade and even a non explosive Handmade bug out on me.  The worse is when I switched to my shepherd's crook and it too did no damage!
---
Yes to much English. I very best at my place of learning.
---
I thought it was a new edition because I just found it myself at lvl 140ish
---
Not a 100% but mine was also a little buggy... I did it to get the camera to do the Pioneer quest line.. I haven’t done the quest line but there should be 7 spots to go to. Try on the pipboy to cancel the quest and then reactivate it.. Hope it works
---
Faschnacht stuff does sell for 200+ caps. And those are in limited quantity - quite the opposite of common
---
I bought a mask for 666 that I didn't get during the event, not like I'm gonna get it now that the events over so it's a seller's market. I'm glad they aren't higher
---
lol good players don't use explosive legendaries. Those are for the scrubs who can't cope without OP gear.
---
I put a Faschnacht Beret on sale for 500 caps on day one of player vending and it was like the second thing I sold.
---
My friend sells them for 1-2k easy lol
---
Why are you fast traveling to camps and complaining?  Thats not how the game is constructed.  Fucking sick of shit posts like this.
---
Exactly what a cheater would say
---
Now I want one, I need to raise some caps cause I have like 276 or 300 caps at most I think
---
Check out jug gaming on YouTube for round houses.
---
Okay. I'm not sticking around to fight the scorchbeast. I'm headed over to Charleston to take care of a few things. This post was my PSA to those who had such difficulty finding the Dead Terrorist and his / her camera.
---
Fact #6 If you scored some good junk and you’re ready to head home, a Yao Guai is on his way to hand you your ass first
---
If anyone ever got banned for reports then you can bet they'd be complaining on the forums. So it probably doesn't happen.
---
you can only have 15 points in strength - 
---
shotgunner  9 needed for maximum damage
---
scattershot    3 reload will suck without these. 
---
bandolier       2 ammo will be a pain without this.
---
14 points total you may be tempted to swap bandolier and scatter shot with melee but then you will have shitty melee and shitty shotgun and shitty weight problems.
---
Snow idea
---
Yeah so I’ll hang out there for people to travel to
---
Only ones are possum and AS ones, probably will be released as AS
---
This post is it. The one near my camp on the southeast side of whitesprings now gets 3 back to back swift hits on me after the latest patch. As a melee build, I no longer fuck with them. They have become to me what scorchbeasts are to many people.
---
Nice! You deserve upvotes for that.
---
Bruh i got 5 mutation serums for 500 each best thing ever
---
Ignore that asshole. So long as you're not cheating, you won't get a ban. Plus there's also the possibility that they didn't actually report you, they just wanted to be cry babies for dying in survival mode
---
Atom shop but most haven't been released yet
---
Nope
---
I tried to send you a friend request from IGN roundyroundy so I can join your server
---
Pretty sure those scout challenges don't work if you buy or are given the things. You'll have to get out the hard way. Sorry.
---
Thank you! I hope so too 😂
---
Love the new frogs. Goes well with my lamp fish. I hope they continue to add more stuff like them to the game
---
I think explosive limb-damage works against NPCs too. However, players have quite low hp counts compared to high-level monsters, and I think that doubles up as limb damage hp, so players would be particularly vulnerable.
---
Yeah I gotta disagree with you here. Price stuff however you want, there are people out there who will pay for it
---
Done!
---
A lot of vendor inventories look like NPC store inventories for me basically everywhere I go
---
Crap. 
---
Is Queen of the Hunt repeatable? Because that’s a good cryptid farming technique.
---
another thing to consider is shotgun is a really good up close weapon anyway - melee would almost be redundant, with shotty and long barrel and scope you can get decent range out of it. the stuff you are going to mele ends up in your face FAST and shotty does damage better up close anyway so youd be better off just keeping shotty firing,
---
sounds like we found who you killed
---
Well we should have Already but Bethesda forgot fallout 4 existed
---
I wasn't polled, why do you claim nobody? You mean.... you won't.
---
"Unkillable" heroes in tin cans that think they rule in PA 😂
---
I just got to remember to take off my auto stim stuff :)
---
Nah definitely wasnt me. He wouldn’t kill me even if he was cheating
---
/u/pokerplayr &amp; /u/Roundy_Roundy Thanks guys. I'm on the way!
---
Mine didn't trigger first time either. Found and looted the tourist again and it triggered
---
Just lose them. iirc not only are they the heaviest ammo but missile launcher and fat man are useless af so nobody uses them
---
I’ll help are you still going I’m level 65 I believe
---
I beat it with a bunch of randos this morning, nbd.
---
oh my god how old are you little one?  do your parents know you're on Reddit?
---
those damn frog hordes attacking my fusion core farm at thunder mountain keep me well supplied with adhesive.
---
Sounds good
---
Many a True Nerd
---
Have to face the facts , SBQ is NOT worth the ammo .
---
I love the side note lol
---
You won't get banned for pvp.  Trust me
---
How did you make the saucer section round?
---
Yeah and it's not cool. I miss all those extra features. The stairs going down the middle in the same square and then up plus the stairs going to the left or right of a floor piece. It's needs to be back now.
---
I spend most of my time in the mire and cranberry bog, so thankfully haven't seen much of that. My problem is when I see completely standard gear selling for braindead prices. Regenerating +rad resistance leather leg for 2750 caps? Assassin's fire rate bp pistol for 4000?
---
I'm pretty used to disappointments though, I find many people with good prices and items but as a high level I just don't ever find much I want. I would suggest to not waste your caps fast traveling, just run over to the camp and clear a few locations on the way there. The exp and loot will make up for any disappointments you find at the vending machine
---
Thank you for this.
---
To anyone that wants to show up. I’m standing next to the body.
---
IGN roundyroundy
---
Literally any drink that says "vintage" in front of it
---
YW
---
I’ve been chasing one for awhile. Our best bet is getting enough legendary scrip to be able to do a ton of 3 star ranged rolls. I had about 500 saved and got some decent stuff, but eventually if you do it enough you’ll get an explosive with possibly two shot on it
---
With the magical power of stupidity. People say or do all sorts of senseless things if you give them the opportunity to say or do otherwise. 😉
---
yeah, make sure you don't have Weapon Artisan perk enabled when you repair it for that quest, or it's going to take MUUUCH longer. 
---
Also, I believe there's a beat-up crossbow sitting around outside the Palace of the Winding Path, if you wanna grab one now. Look for the archery target, and then there's a table nearby with a crossbow on it.
---
I have tse 2* handmade for 4k
---
Nuclear winter came early
---
Have you tried playing a dragonless run through yet? It’s an entirely different game without shouts.
---
Coming to the end of day 3 .... still haven't seen a drop better than 2* ... and that was by the SBQ
---
I don’t have a mic but I’m a good listener
---
It's odd. He's labeled as Ansel for me. Thanks for this anyway.
---
damn you todd howard!
---
It took me a minute I thought you were referring to the missile launchers then I realize you’re talking about the fat man
---
Fact #7: Persistent stagger hits from a Yao Guai is equal to stepping on Legos after the soles of your feet were just recently skinned....
---
Let the pain of that sink into your brain.
---
This is very comforting.
---
Thanks.
---
Cool thanks!
---
AMAZING!!
---
Ill buy it. But can it be tomrrow or on monday?
---
This must be the one.
---
I have to jump through hoops to make a cool normal house within the rules and this boi just makes a fucking starship
---
Lol
---
Dude no offense but go outside
---
You selling this???????? I’ll give you 5k caps for it
---
Yes, they can drop. Had a day where I fast traveled to Flatwoods right as the event fertile soil was ending. It tossed me into the event, the person finished up the event, and I got that super rare white responder fireman hat. I flipped out haha
---
Is this offer still up?
---
And Saphyrice wins Fallout 76.
---
... take us out Mr. Sulu, warp 5.
---
Not planning on it.  If so, it would take much more than 5k to pry it from my hands. ;)
---
Idk man.
---
This looks like THEIR server to me.
---
Yea I can do it tomorrow for sure, monday not so much
---
Legendary modifiers on armor can make regular armor comparable, but for nuke zones its either hazmat suit or power armor
---
This isn't a terrible idea, but I think the reward tiers that you suggest are generally bad ideas.
---
Damn lol have fun with that godly thing
---
yeah getting pretty tired of the level 20 pipe pistols for 500 caps, junk, and ammo at RIDICULOUS prices-type vendors.  :(  I only visit places I have a reason to or stumble upon.
---
Thank you for providing such an excellent example of irony. I really enjoyed it.
---
I stressed out and cry and scream and kick small animals while making my chicken coop of a C.A.M.P. and someone made the Enterprise??!!!
---
I hope so tomorrow too im not sure tho because i may have to work but if i get home early tomorrow if i do go then hopefully i can buy it off you
---
You can still buy serum plans for players for a fraction of that price. I bought about 7 of them for 3.5k each a week or two ago, and I bought several more for 5k less than a week ago. I think I got a pretty good deal, but even twice what I paid is less than it is at the enclave.
---
I just keep making them because I want to spread the love
---
Can and will vouch for Jim. Great guy, thrust worthy and resourceful.  WILL do business with again. :) &lt;3
---
I paid 200 caps for the owl mask. I had one on a previous play though and wanted one for my new character.
---
They do show the typical signs...
---
I imagine that missile launcher damage is highly dependent on perks (demolition expert) If they were potent fresh off an enemy it would be one less reason to keep the perk equipped.
---
That's a good question.  I just assumed it gave me a better chance for TS and/or Explosive?
---
Sounds good, message me and I’ll be on
---
They would be so bad if they didn't cause so much 
---
***S t A g G e R***
---
Xbox sorry.
---
They spawn as male (Ansel) or female (Anna)
---
fat man is useless, yes. but daisy cutter is not. It weighs like 2 pounds, and with the right perk your mini nukes weigh very little also. with the explosive dam/rad perk it does some serious damage. I routinely carry 20+ mini nukes, and never have capacity issues stemming from that.
---
Same just happened to me yesterday, I sympathize.
---
I miss the raider armor from nuka world and the outfit mannequins
---
It should be lower. Dumbass.....
---
Eye eye capt'n
---
Via xbox or reddit?
---
I had 10k 50. Cal rounds when I started one fight. Came out with 5k, a two-star pipe wrench, and my reward junk stolen.
---
correct
---
Either/or Gt: HerbalxAssassin
---
Bethesda came up with a brilliant casino idea then told everyone to spend maximum an hour there per day.
---
I can confirm you can’t revive someone with anything other than a regular stimpack. Super and diluted do not work. I just saw this today trying to help someone do the revive in water.
---
Anyone know how much it costs?
---
Not sure why they don't work, but I do know you can't use supers to revive someone. I usually have 140 supers on me and can't revive unless I have regulars as well..
---
OH! And when I try to put door into existing doorframe: "Cannot place here, item appears to be floating"
---
yup, same here. I'd be hosed without that perk.
---
Yes.
---
Sad truth...we have so little endgame stuff. Should be guaranteed 3* or 2 , weapon &amp; armor imo. Cant say the Pepsqick event is worth anything either lol
---
Nope he is pretty common
---
Nice!
---
Yes, there is.
---
Okay thanks
---
&gt; Pepsqick
---
/r/ihadastroke?
---
Random Event Vendor - seen him at the last section of Free Range on one of the routes, and in the middle of the large dried up lake. The first time I saw him I couldn't afford his plans, second time I nabbed them.
---
He was released during the start of Wild Appalachia and the introduction of Wasted on the Wasteland. He sells two unique recipes.
---
Some people don’t wanna spend the time to find that stuff legitimately. I once sold the civil war dress for 1k caps back in like December. He just wanted it and had the extra caps. I tried to tell him where to get it but he wanted to buy it instead.
---
Q25 tesla wrecks me if I fire at a crowd
---
Is their a certain random event trigger like crossing charestlons bridge or does he just appear?
---
I had a small room with a door on the roof, blueprinted, had stairs under room leading to the room. Could not place it with the stairs in place, had to put another set of stairs in a different position, delete the original stairs, fill the hole in the roof. It would then let me place the blueprinted room where I wanted, then remove a tile in the room and put the stairs back to the room, remove the other set of temporary stairs and fill the hole in the roof. Simple as.
---
Also anyone else getting the game saying you have nothing selected, when you do? Then having to quit out of build and back into build to place an object.
---
Every single explosive weapon makes the same noise...
---
Best of luck friend!
---
That is freaking incredible!!!!!
---
Unfortunately I’m not sure! I was just running down the road and I saw a robot and almost shot him until I saw the Brahmin! If it helps I was going east to west on the road with the 64 right under the junkyard
---
We have dungeons soon right? Would be cool.
---
I miss the mannequins too. I...never played Nuka world. 😅
---
No but your mom does. Everytime we take a break im on her phone in this sub
---
I suspect there's a lot of pointing involved, mostly.
---
Gotcha, appreciate it 👍
---
Disagree. Lead, acid, plastic, gunpowder = 500. Steel = 1000. Everything else 100. Gotta craft ammo somehow......
---
Nah. I got one a couple weeks ago, still have .
---
No power in the 'verse
---
Have tou tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Did the trick for me a couple weeks ago.
---
yeet
---
This is my new favorite post. Also those are explosive weapons
---
The only thing close to the sound of a tse shotty is a flechette harpoon.
---
Not really with it until lv 15.
---
Dude I’ve owned all sorts of explosives and they all sound the same when they hit something
---
cool..thnx for.the info
---
yeah, sure thing little guy.  Its way past your bedtime.
---
i have a lvl 35 be assaultron head btw lol
---
Shouldnt that be a nuka cola dark?
---
The sheepssquatch , sorry for spelling lol
---
Where’s a good place to get screws? I never have enough feels like
---
Won't you lose your progress?  I'm over 100 and it took me so long to achieve that.  Thank you for your time into this matter.
---
A shotgun sounds way different than my handmade auto. I have a collection of them too.
---
Yes.  Multiple photo tasks over multiple weeks just stop working.  I’ve had some success trying the weekly again a few days later.  Too burnt out to worry about trying this week’s again.
---
Me and my ‘Bloody Hell’ Gordon Ramsay bloodied rolling pin build would like a word
---
Sledge? Nah just a board at that level lol
---
\+karma
---
I carry the 2 lb Daisycutter everywhere I go. Whenever I find the nukes people drop, I take them and randomly fire them into the air. Who knows were they land? Not my problem man.
---
Whatever you say
---
Scrip the wood leg right away! People have reported that three star wood always turn into one star after restart. Don't let a tough day become tougher tomorrow lol

Sneak, Covert Operative, Escape Artist, All 9 Rifleman, Tank Killer and/or Concentrated Fire, Bloody Mess.

---
Fairly easy to kill, and decent loot. What’s not to like???
---
Straight up, helped about 6 different people transfer stuff between their accounts. My account was flagged and banned. I don't think I'll ever buy another bethesda product after this.
---
how do you have 50 cans? I'm always nearly out from eating it all
---
Yea that did happen because I cashed out all the scrip before I hit her up! Lol. But I did make about 15k in sales in the past couple hours so the day ended on a positive note!
---
At first when I was a noob, yeah. Now i know better at level 177
---
Ok hero
---
I need to go to office areas or mechanic places
---
Kinda like garage sales... our crap could be your crap.
---
I've also never understood it either.
---
It's not like many of the mods have unique models. Sure, some do. But how many guns can you tell at a glance have a hardened receiver compared to  a vicious?
---
Well, as far as floating camps go this one gets a pass.
---
No you won't lose your progress. I've uninstalled twice trying to fix issues, it's one of the steps Bethesda will suggest if they ever get around to your ticket. On that note if it's been 2 weeks with no reply I would start a new one
---
If it wasn't meant to be taken, it wouldn't be a publicly available bag
---
also, I seem to remember an announcement of "get rid of the duped items if you don't want a ban", have no duped items, still banned. My money goes with me
---
Lost something good did you?
---
Nasi lamek?
---
One handed, two handed, unarmed.
---
Other damage perks only effect one or the other, slugger, gladiator, iron fists.
---
Incisor effects them all.
---
Honestly this was all handled badly. Makes me glad I didn't upgrade to the power armor edition.
---
Do you need the code pieces if you can just use Nukacrypt? Although I totally understand not wanting to and actually wanting to find the code and decoding it
---
Nah, it's just silly that people can do such things without repercussion.
---
For example, if you die during a Queen fight, I shouldn't be worrying about rushing to my bag before it gets stolen, I should be worrying about killing the Queen.
---
I still get a good 4000-6000 in about 1.5 hours across the map so I wouldn’t say it’s less productive.  Just tedious.  And it’s up to whoever to put in the time.
---
You die you have a chance to lose your junk simple enough... Now we should be happy it's not armor weapons or meds that stuff is more valuable
---
This is the best balance suggestions I’ve heard for survival absolutely hands down.
---
Milking Brahmin is shared across anyone on the server so if anyone else killed them first there’s a cool down till anyone can try again. I think it’s once per hour.
---
bitch gave me wood
---
Its beautifully horrifying. Thank you.
---
Yep! go to the lake near thunder mountain power plant, and go just south from the lake, factory is VERY close by it and should be a map maker when you are near the southern edge of it.
---
Also, according to the note, get ready to be drafted into the skeleton war...
---
I’ve learned to stash my junk before taking on the queen
---
we need that limit, why reward mule characters and dupers. If people actually played within the expectation of the games rules we would not have this problem. If you want to make a request, make it to them to stop but I would not hope for a positive reply.
---
Yeah almost every weapon in Fallout 76 is based on a real life weapon, except for the energy weapons of course. e.g. 50 caliber machine gun = M2 Browning, gatling gun = 1876 german gatling gun, combat rifle = BAR/PPSh41 rifle, auto grenade launcher - MK19 grenade launcher, pump shotgun = close to FN P-12; there are many weapons as such out there.
---
Who doesn't stash their junk before fighting the Queen? That's on you pal.
---
Stealing is raiding. You can pick the lock on someone's house and get a bounty, but if you take their loot, everything is fine?
---
They got them moves like stagger
---
OK, how about 1000 limit per weekly refresh?
---
Pretty sure it’s a daily
---
How do you start this quest anyway?
---
How come you were NOT using a BOS hood in that pic? lol
---
I have no problem losing my junk, it's the fact that people can just steal with zero consequences.
---
I know.
---
But whenever I go to the Hunter’s Shack, it’s never activated.
---
Soon for me I hope.,just wish I could do more then 150 a day... I was thrilled that I was under 600 carry weight without thru-hiker equipped (for a little while at least lol).
---
Level 122 and have used the mod from day 1.
---
If you have parasites/dysentery, gum should help. Plus an action point boost is always welcome.
---
Check it out in your personal terminal
---
I'm not sure! This was my first time launching a nuke, so i have no idea if i actually need all the pieces in my inventory. But, after launching it once, all 8 pieces are still in my inventory. I think if they were mandatory for launching nukes, they would be removed, right?
---
But in any case, I was happy to put in all the legwork this time.
---
no if you have a mxed card you cannot have another maxed card if they would just let us split them back up after that would also solve the issue
---
I see. Guess I’ve never had a need for it.
---
The difference is you died and dropped your loot. It's no longer yours until you get it back. Your camp is always yours
---
Very nice!
---
Can't use my t60 now &amp; I can carry more than my excavator pa, I can carry 460 out of pa. &amp; 450 in excavator  pa
---
Last time I had to defend against mutants and 2 SBs!
---
that's the same for me as well
---
no some will be stationary go back and look again only the final one you get in a perk pack is animated
---
3 SBs for me again today.   Twice.   Wtf.
---
You’ll need another keycard
---
Losing junk isn't the issue... It's the raiding without consequence which is.
---
Oh me and your mom gunna be up all night. Pretty soon you’re gunna have to start calling me step daddy. And you aren gunna talk to your step dad like this
---
I really hate when I had 2 scrips of daily limut left and can't milk it out,  they should at least remove that limit so we can sell a one star something to make it 0
---
Thank you 4 months later 😊
---
I mean, it’s a pretty small repercussion for dying, is how I view it. I guess it could initiate pvp, whatever, but I don’t see any reason for a player who does it to become wanted. (And I’ve had my shit taken when I died a few times.)
---
I launched my first with no codes just Nukacrypt so I don't think you need them but I could see how finding them all would make it feel more special. They expire at the end of the week
---
I'm going to take that map of teddy bears and photograph all of them.
---
You're going to go through weapons.  Every 10 levels so you might as well not get invested into anything.
---
Did you listen to the holotape?
---
Nah, turrets don't attack if you picklock or hack. Did it twice on a person's camp in front of a turret only got wanted for 20 caps. Found 5 people throughout and none of them wanted to kill me was a pain to get rid of the bounty
---
Deep pocketed armor: 50
---
15 STR: 225
---
Unyielding set: 75
---
5 more STR (Radicool): 25
---
5 more STR (+STR on every piece): 25
---
High capacity Backpack: 120
---
Strong back: 40
---
Solar powered: 15
---
Herd Mentality: 10
---
You’d have 42 STR and have to be low health on a team. Your carry weight would be: 585.
---
what system, let's go follow them
---
It's not different. Picking the lock on someone's base if far less threatening than stealing their bag of junk.
---
Any open fissure sites, once nuked, are sealed. No other scorchbeasts can spawn from it (this is localized to the server. Once the server terminates, the fissuee site is reopened)
---
I poured a little lemon vodka in it, so it’s my Nukashine.
---
Bugged.  They’ll fix next week!
---
That's a fun story! Nice work! I had a similar experience the first time I encountered the sheepsquatch, for some reason two spawned and I had to fight both. Took a good 700 rounds and I had to find a spot they couldnt melee me.  Was an exciting moment when I realized I survived.
---
It's a bag of scrap lying on the ground. Doesn't come anywhere close to raiding. It's really not difficult to find more junk.
---
Wait. People do that without it being a joke?
---
didnt know you were into dead bodies.  gross.
---
A mediocre kit drummer here.... Best of luck with the drum corp. That's some pretty cool stuff. I have to admit I never learned a single paradiddle, and it shows 😁
---
Level 22 XBox, camp is on river. Willing to die for a decon arch. 😈
---
Still need help? I've done it but happy to give you a hand
---
This has been the case in every fallout game since 3.
---
Good luck with it, I'll play the drums at my camp in your honor.
---
What if you die again before you get to it? What if your game crashes? What if you just decide "fuck it" and leave the game before taking your loot back? Then there would be nothing lost from anybody taking it. Once you die, it's not your loot. It's not stealing because you don't own it. It's a world object. If you don't want to risk losing it, don't bring it with you
---
If no one takes it how do you lose it?
---
Yeah, it's a real bitch. For lead and aluminum
---
It's sort of like going to a flea market. There's all kinds of people there.
---
You have the people who are selling decent stuff they don't want for cheap because they just need the space.
---
You have the people who have some business acumen who actually want to sell stuff to make money so they run a good shop, prices aren't cheap or high just... eh.
---
You have the people who have a bunch of bait items to draw in people, priced high, but they don't expect anyone to buy that stuff.. they want people to buy the small things they have for sale at slightly padded prices as an impulse or guilt buy because you spent so much time gawking at all the rare and expensive crap they have.
---
You have the people who have a ton of stuff but all of it's crap, but you don't know till you got all the way to their store to find out so you buy some crap anyway so they restock that crap because, well, you bought it. (The dollar store business plan)
---
You have the people who have no concept of money, they probably are playing on a TV they bought from Rent-A-Center for double the msrp, and everything in their shop is priced double what its worth "because it's convenient for you" and they complain that vending is a waste of time because nobody buys stuff and people mess with their camp.
---
Then you have the crazy people that put random stuff in their machine, whatever lights up that bulb in the back of their mind that day, and if you don't like it screw off. Mentioning that you don't think they will sell that weird stuff may make them block you or server hop. (I may fall into this group as I've stocked a machine with tea pots of various types today, next to a machine full of top tier under armors at materials cost, and I know someone will buy both of them).
---
Oh and the people who are just trying to trap and kill you. I'm not sure if real flea markets have  an equivalent to those people, but if they do it's probably the people who try to get you to sign your kids up for free modeling contracts without mentioning the photos cost $800 or who tell you they're entering you for a free trip but it's actually a timeshare presentation.
---
Eagles eyes for the +4 perception and the +25% Critical damage.
---
not "people" -you have shown throughout this that you give little credence to hardware 
---
at any rate, have fun complaining rather than finding people who have improved the game performance and trying what they did
---
The collector we are on 24 of 25 we just in search of 1 magazine to complete
---
For tradeable items you can share the task with friends you have to sell items to a train vendor and your friends they buy them back that also counts as them finding them
---
It feels good. Then I scrip my weapons and roll for new 3*s and get all heavy weapons and can’t scrip them again until next day. Stash is full yet again.
---
They're assholes.... so there's that
---
Right now there is a bug where items can't be inspected at the vending machine unless the owner of the camp is there. It means that if someone wants to sell legendaries they have to stand at their camp and do nothing. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
---
WITCH HUNT WITCH HUNT WHO'S WITH ME?
---
This sh*t right here. If my wall is green that means go. Not “the item is floating/intersecting....”   no no it’s not damn you
---
Well, if you'd actually read my comment properly that would have helped you respond better...
---
And yes, it is rading. Stealing is raiding.
---
You have contracted Swamp Itch.
---
Can we have a scope at least? Or a working aiming sight?
---
Did they ever fix the bug that caused them to use all of your fusion cells?
---
I’ve been in a similar situation, except the people I was facing had Sent/ass. I lasered them with the Vats Crits, and they reported me for hacking because I could actually kill them.
---
Still nothing.
---
To this day, whenever people say “you’re getting banned” I say “When, I need to mark it on my calendar” 
---
If they give me a date, I mark it on my calendar and on that day, tell them they were wrong, and laugh about it.
---
best and highest amount i've heard of so far 👌
---
I love the Fallout franchise and there was no doubt in my mind I was buying this game. I played it nonstop the first 2 weeks of launch and no longer had anything to by the third. I came back a week ago and enjoyed seeing all of the bugs that would make the game a hassle to play fixed and all of the new content that was added while I played other games. 3 days later and the same problem arose again. I ran out of things to do. Maybe that's just me doing everything to fast but other people I met playing said the same thing. You really have nothing to do at times. I love playing the game but get bored doing the same things to get better gear for my character or more of the same items I already have. Right now the game is pretty void of end game content but the things I've heard about the upcoming DLC seems pretty intriguing. I'd wait until E3 to see what Bethesda has planned and if you like what you've heard and seen then try it out.
---
I feel like somehow homing arrows would break the game with bugs or something. Idk I don’t think they can implement it perfectly.
---
Time to shred some gnar gnar powder brah
---
yep.thats fixed now..i remember using 7k fusion cells in one shot lol
---
Ouch! I never fired the one I had then read about that bug and I was very glad I didn’t experience it lol
---
I’d also like to tell you...
---
It’s not all about weight.
---
I use a 1 Str sniper and I have no difficulty lugging around 20 ish legendary guns and a lot of loot.
---
I’d recommend more weight reduction if you go down this path of weight however.
---
You can rename them... lol
---
I thought they did....
---
This isn't a particularly difficult subject. Something as simple as a 2 minute timer to reclaim your junk could be started before it's free real estate.
---
You're over complicating it.
---
Oh, whine some more. How about you don't suck? Don't bring items into a situation where you can lose them? Welcome to the wasteland.
---
They did?
---
Inspect the chassis and you'll see an option to rename
---
You can.
---
Dog Bowl for best boy Dogmeat. He was at Doggy Day Camp on Reclaimation Day.
---
Ok, thank you so much for the help.
---
I panic shotgunned Insult Bot the first time I ran into him cause I was in the middle of fighting a pack of wolves at a meth lab and he surprised me.
---
I simply disagree with the mechanic. No need to get rude...
---
I guess its good that I have been using the old 99 cents isn't a dollar tactic for pricing. I've been accidentally saving caps.
---
I have unyielding with wwr on 3 pieces, 1 ammo, and 1 junk reduction and it’s stupid the amount of stuff I carry! 4 pieces have +1 strength (also armor plated back pack) and I think it says my carry weight is 475 (usually stay between 375-425)but when I get inky PA my weight jumps up to 650! Sucks I can’t go to a nuke zone until I shed some weight!
---
What's between you and the 400 caps marsupial serum would cost? It is by far the biggest qol mutation available.
---
Bethesda should let them snap together ffs
---
Lol you wanna tell me I didn't read. Did you even read what you just typed? What is "rading", is that when you take a gamma gun to some bitch?😂
---
But on a more serious note, picking up trash off the ground is not hostile. At all. You're just asking Bethesda to force people into PvP.
---
How can you tell when a bag was intentionally dropped or dropped at death? You're telling me I deserve a bounty because I found some a bag of copper and steel lying around?
---
Someone consistently following people through an event and picking up every bag in site would be a dick move, but again, if you know you're going into a fight where you might die a few times, *stash your shit*.
---
Your ignorance is showing bud... they added this months ago. Get with the times.
---
oh wow look a nuke zone, who would have guessed it has people in it?
---
Now we're talking
---
that's crazy, but also smart
---
You mean, add it again because it's so **awesome**? Check!
---
You're unbelievable.
---
"Show me numbers of how many people are playing a game."
---
So I did
---
"Those numbers don't count because that game is free."
---
Okay, fine. That's why I also included the likes of GTA V, just to emphasize the difference between a "Popular" game and a "Not Popular" game.
---
How about something like Assassin's Creed Odyssey? It only came out a month before Fallout 76, but has 4,500,000 registered players. More than double 76. Or is that not good enough either?
---
And guess what? The rule for "active players" you have? It also applies to Fallout 76. Do you have any idea the sheer number of players that bought the game and abandoned it when it first came out? 
---
Actually, I'm over it. You're clearly going to keep fishing for some contrarian argument that doesn't even make sense, so I'm done playing your game. You're more than welcome to be as wrong and deluded as you want, and be equally surprised when the game doesn't come close to meeting your expectations.
---
They did, I have my Enclave X-01, my Mothman X-01, and my X-Cavator armors.
---
i'll look into this
---
Bravo. Simply amazing.
---
My head canon is that the sonic boom when the bombs dropped left 99 percent of the population deaf.
---
She aint dead. She just doesnt like you and prefers to have you think that so she doesnt have to deal with you
---
I think implementing an arbitrary timer over turning a game mechanic into a crime for the player would be over complicating it, not the other way around
---
Bloodied explosive laser rifle
---
I see what you're saying.  I never found a use for it either.
---
If you're still looking for someone on PC, I need the revive/revive in water/revive in a team trio. We can trade revives.
---
This!!!!!

TSE Tesla = win with this thing

---
It's an online game so progression is saved on bethesda servers. What you will lose however, is any saved images/pictures from your travels. Those save locally.
---
an impulsive, insecure child on the internet spouting nonsense.  what a unique character you are.
---
You don't have to agree with me, but there are plenty of ways to make it easy to tell if it's someone's death bag. Literally just add a "steal" option, instead of take.
---
And I do think you should at least get the option at revenge.
---
It's the hitscan laser mechanic making the explosions so accurate. I have a BE laser rifle, automatic, with beam splitter, it melts anything, even imposter sheepsquatch in like 3 seconds flat.
---
True
---
How do you get up there?
---
Why you gotta be such a dick?
---
I'm not saying that it's a great idea by itself.  It's just brainstorming ideas of a potential change to the mechanic.
---
Anything is better than the current system.
---
What if there was a limit on the type of weapon you may turn into scrip? Like no more than 1 handmade each day? Even if someone duped theyd still be likely to be getting scrip at the same rate as someone who grinds organic legendaries
---
I would love this
---
Just like Aquaman, Aquaboy/girl is useless on land...
---
That would be frustrating if you had a couple of weapons of the same kind that you got legitimately. I got three harpoon guns from the vendor on my first day and I don’t use them at all.
---
Why you have to be so sensitive? You probably want a participation trophy too don't you? For the record i was just joking around, no need to get all butt hurt.
---
Yeah I don't worry about boosts from food and drink. I'm pretty bad at making builds and stats. Not good at things like meta builds and whatnot.
---
I ate 2 tubs of Great Value Neapolitan ice cream after this insult....😖
---
I could grind all day if they would just remove the daily cap
---
Fact #8: You thought Yao Guais were bad? Wait until you see the Giant Robo-Guai
---
776 with maxed out buying perk card
---
You just want Bethesda to add pointless shit that clearly no one but you wants because you mad you lost some junk. Quit whining on reddit and play the game, you'll get it back in no time. Good luck, have fun!
---
Saw a ghoul slayer gamma gun for 22000
---
I can guarantee that you could have gotten back whatever junk you lost in the time it took to respond to me and everybody else in this thread. It really, really is not that big of a deal. The system is fine as it is
---
The highest I’ve personally maxed out at is 540 at 40hp
---
You can sell your backpacks in vendor machines? I thought it was character-locked, like the ProSnap cameras
---
What have you gotten?
---
I’ve been selling them at my camp as I’m role playing a brewery called “bubblegum brewery”
---
They seem to sell well for 20 caps
---
Yes, this.
---
Right until a 3* handmade takes up all that stash space again, rip
---
Agreed
---
It was a joke on the title. Hood is slang for ghetto, gangster, or thug. Insert translation. Whshhheww. Right over your head. I forget that not everybody uses the same terminology or slang.
---
That’s not bad at all. My numbers dipped super low so I stopped (and cap ‘searching’ was bugged pretty bad for me) but if you’re pulling in 4-6k in that time, it’s not bad at all. Good to know cap stashes are back :)
---
You can sell the mod plan, not the backpack itself
---
Fact #9: When asked about the end game, Todd Howard just frowned and the growl of a Yao Guai was heard in the distance.
---
LOL
---
I know people are down voting all your comments OP but I agree! Only scumbags see someone die then go and take their stuff. A.) anyone who has any valuable junk is not going to leave the game or not come back for their bag B.) The idea of a timer is GENIUS. That should be a thing even if it’s only 60 seconds. C.) if you take that bag within 60 seconds it should initiate pvp. I’m with you 100% and I think this is the only real complaint I have as far as the game goes. I shouldn’t have to fill my box with 200 lbs of random junk because the world is full of poacher assholes. Honestly it doesn’t happen to me that often any more. Got killed today after buying 25 flux on my way back to my camp and surprisingly the guy didn’t take my bag.
---
Same here. Very exhausting
---
200 lbs is 90.8 kg
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Because it looks crappy :D Looks like a WW2 pilot cap :D
---
rip
---
WHY ARE WE PAYING TAXES AND THE EVENT COST IS STILL SO HIGH?!?!
---
I've got powered gates and security doors set up at my camp.
---
First switch seals the front doors for safe shopping, and the second switch seals the panic room/emergency exit.
---
I left the game and cried on reddit ;-;
---
Lol. I'm good.
---
I can only get the ones at the Free Range to work.
---
Is this the one you need marcupial for to get to ?
---
I have one at my personal vendor for 1k caps u can add me im on rn my ign is Sweetness87
---
Okay, that is good to know!
---
Once you have the schematics learned you can craft as many as you want
---
I’d love that but the limitations are likely in place for server stability
---
Dieing is already pretty inconsequential. Potentially losing abit of junk just adds to the game. Plus possession is 9/10ths of the law they say. Its not the same as stealing outright
---
It was confirmed that all Ps4 games will work with the Ps5
---
Were you by any chance influenced by the Fallout 4 mod?
---
Yes, it would be a stretch for FO, I got carried away a bit there.
---
You don't mean the Super Mecha-Yao Guai?! I heard those were just legends. Stories passed down from C.A.M.P. Fire to C.A.M.P. Fire....
---
I know that it’s not appearing on the power armor station and I’ve gone to that terminal and selected the section to unlock the power armor schematic many times but nothing happens
---
Hmm
---
Np. Sorry I couldn't get the name of the quartz gazebo thing.
---
I tried around back with both my jetpack, marsupial, AND the crossbow. It's also blocked like the other side I had tried before. 
---
For that matter, I tossed an artillery smoke grenade, and those aren't even functional mortars up there! :(
---
Yea honestly I’m a big hoarder. I’ve been keeping all my weapons in anticipation of the new vendor and weapon weight reduction is the best thing that’s ever happened to my unyielding build! I suggest anyone who likes to keep legendaries to go out and acquire some unyielding weight reduction pieces. You will not regret it!!!
---
I just got one yesterday
---
Solution: Instant perma ban for scripping duped items.  It's easy to tell if there are duped items in an inventory, even easier if you're comparing one weapon to a list of the players scripped weapons for the week.  Would be a simple way to ban some cheaters.
---
🤔👍
---
Visit Morgantown Airport...
---
THIS!  I just float around this game. Grinding. Living. Do some quests.  Trying and keep upgrading weapons.  Not really about 1000% optimum maximum domination of the game sand everyone in it.   It’s pathetic how much time spent (wasted), just farming workshops and routine spawns.
---
Huh.  Ok.
---
Ha, what a timely post for me. My main is level 350 now so I thought I'd start a new toon. Just got out of the vault and was thinking how very badly I wanted to loot everything in the vaulit but couldn't. Seriously why can't we loot our own room at least ***cries***
---
&gt;Dont be discouraged
---
I don't believe the RNG isn't evenly weighted. I've used probably about 2500 scrip since it started, and I've had some amazing rolls. I have multiple characters (which does help), but still didn't have 1000 scrip for each one. My strategy was to go for 2-star ranged weapons every time to maximise the number of rolls I have. 
---
So far I have a QE Handmade, AAE Black Powder Rifle, B/25FR Railway Rifle, F/25FR Gatling gun, B/25FR Railway Rifle plus some of others that almost as good. I did not see an even spread of weapons or legendary effects,
---
On top of concepts for the Scorchbeast Queen there was also the Level 90 3-Star Legendary Diseased Stunted Scorched Glowing Albino Irradiated Dusky Yao Guai.
---
At least that is what Todd was trying to pitch but those are just rumors....
---
Jumping off of buildings is fun anyway. Win for me, win for you.
---
I would suggest shadowed combat armor, but you will probably end up preferring decent legendary effects over anything else.
---
Yeah the search thing is working again so it’s great.  Pop a cap bobblehead and hit the populated spots first and do a little hopping across the map and it works out!
---
Go pick a switch outta the back. ill be done with her soon
---
First no, second yes
---
The answer is no. Vanguard, Bolstering, and Weightless are all prefix modifiers. You can only have one.
---
That’s pretty amazing, make sure you move your caps off before it reaches 25k, or your stuff will sell but you won’t get the caps!
---
Well you have the explosive shotgun with is kinda an echoey "fsheeeewwww" then you the explosive .50 Cal which is all like " fshewfshewfshewfshewfshew" then you have the explosive gatling gun that goes like "fshew    fshew     fshew" in a really deep voice.
---
Underrated comment
---
Lol I know! I sold a furious laser rifle and it took me to 25, the guy was still there so I hurried up and turned off my xbox :P
---
Me love you long time :D
---
I actually just finally got the Responder Fireman Outfit from a Real Blast event in the Savage Divide. So, it can be gotten at high levels outside of the forest and not just from responder events.
---
lol that’s a swift way to handle accounting issues 😂
---
Shotgun, thank you
---
Yes, you can have a Vanguard powered piece. I have one.
---
Vanguard powered
---
Bolster powered
---
Weightless powered
---
Are all possible. The first piece is a prefix modifier, the powered is a major modifier.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
sell it to the purveyor for script
---
Holy brahmin you’re a real legendary traveling pharmacy
---
What's "script"? I want that
---
That is true. At lower levels they do come at you hard and fast.
---
They just need a sound bite of Picard saying “Damage report?” if someone attacks it and it will be complete
---
Or... Increase benefits for a successful completion to also encourage participation and reduce quitters?
---
Whatever ends up fitting your play style. Weight reduction pieces are always great, but you might want to go for unyielding or vanguard based or some specific faction resistance based on how you play
---
Lol this is the greatest list i have ever seen on this sub.
---
Would bolstering or unyielding be better for a bloodied rifle sneak build?
---
I'd say either the 3* TS limb damage or 2* TS ffr
---
The first...you're doing a significant amount of limb damage. The last is also pretty damn good though.
---
10mm or 10mm smg?
---
I was asking myself why enjoyed this post so much, being so useless...
---
I hear that was supposed to be a miniboss that preceded the last boss which was a Yao-guai riding the scorchbeast.
---
Lol, word from management folks.
---
Ok but have you seen WV right now? Their tax money is going to OTHER states. Their state is slowly dying economically.
---
It depends on how much you use and your build supports VATS. Without VATS the two star will do the most damage. With VATS it gets more complicated.
---
I run a bloodied automatic build and use all Bolstering/sentinel pieces with one Bolstering/chameleon piece. If you don't want to run bloodied look into Vanguard armor set
---
Not max level and Gatling VATS cost is high. I don’t think it will be in demand. I think it’s worth 40 scrip.
---
100 is a lot, I only keep 40-100 of a few key items that I use a lot, for everything else I only keep about 20 (2 bulked) and other stuff like leather, glass, bones only 10.
---
I generally just do a run to get the specific stuff I need, like a lead run and/or a plastic run if I needed shotgun shells. But I've been playing a long time, I don't need much anymore, so most of my junk is for ammo, repairs, and producing chems and serums that I sell.
---
I've sold about a dozen fasnacht masks at 500 a piece. Just because you don't want to spend it does not mean that no one is willing to spend it.
---
agreed
---
Tell me when the LMG gets some mods. It has five slots for mods and yet the only one it has is a Prime Receiver.
---
Can we maybe get something to rechamber it to use a more common ammo type at the cost of reduced damage?
---
Super sledges aren't even that good.
---
Happened to me to.
---
Well because you skipped the step that gives you the plans, it looks like you wont be able to ever get them
---
Both, although I would argue for unyielding more than bolstering since the point of a sniper would be to not get hit at all
---
Don't know how to fix it..but what platform are you on?
---
Xbox I don’t have a pc yet
---
You know? The sherpdorch
---
This is one floating base that I’ll approve of. *applause*
---
Saints row 4?
---
Just killed an SBQ, got a one star ghoul slayer leg armor... And yes 3 star loot drop rate dropped a lot since latest patch. Many of the three star glowing ones only drop wood piece or drill. Good news is they improved the imposter sheepsquatch loot, I haven’t got any wood from that event lately.
---
Happened to me first time I used one fighting a SBQ. Hurt my SOUL. Mainly bc all I brought  with me were energy weapons. My friend couldn't stop laughing
---
Move to some place with a deposit, found many nice spots but its best to have a deposit of some kind
---
Just the bullets probably
---
This

Thanks! http://imgur.com/gallery/XPwCtT0

Regular bubble gum is 50%  for longer I think but yeah I have speed demon and I chew the shit out of gum
---
I assume Squatch, if only because that's the only other "boss" event?
---
2* two shot fire rate imo
---
So your popping gum every 2 minutes?  I have speed demon and I’ve never really needed it. Always seem to have plenty of water and various food to pop.
---
Yeah, they aren't worth their weight to sell, their value to weight ratio is so bad it's easy to find free dropped ones from other players if you do use them. I wish you could scrap them for nuclear material etc.
---
I do have an Instigating Fatman however, it's more just for fun though. Nuka cola grenades are good enough honestly and only weight a fraction of a mini nuke.
---
They count for those rare "chew gum" daily challenges. That's about it IMO.
---
Maybe other people have already bought all of the good stuff people are selling. Idk about everyone else, but all of my good stuff sold first &amp; all I have left for sale right now is ok junk lol
---
Yea they are working on a fix for it.
---
I’m sure you will get what your after soon, good luck!
---
No hand outs in the wasteland. Get out there and scavenge.
---
Nah not every two minutes but I chew it a lot and I go through water super hardcore, food not so much glowing meat is easy to come by
---
Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately sounds like you're running into this bug and will require a ticket opened with Bethesda to repair your account.
---

---
My guess is the Purveyor isn't intended to be the primary means of legendary grinding, it's supposed to supplement it by giving you a way to trade trash for potentially useful stuff. Considering that, the caps prevent you from using it as your sole source of legendaries.  
---
Personally, I think the Purveyor is fine as is (the only issue being the wood armor/assualtron head weirdness). I'd rather see the grind for legendaries addressed in other ways (such as having 2/3 star enemies drop 2/3 star items, remove syringers/drills or allow them to be legendary, allow us to change armor types from light to sturdy to heavy, etc).
---
Come on guys...its a 30 minute run and you have 100lbs of junk OR stash it ..you dont need 500 of each junk. Take a pic of what you need to repair weapons and armor
---
Sugar Grove, you're welcome
---
Also plain gum is 50% for 10 minutes
---
I got lower level gear when I went for a 1 star. That was at lvl 20. Don't know if you went for 3 star or not. That might be the problem
---
Yes I am, I always carry a literally a ton of food, chems, aid, and water on me. Without thru hiker, traveling pharm., and my aid and chems weight reduction leg and arm, I weigh close to 1000 lbs, but with those two perk cards and the armor it brings me down to close to 190 weight.
---
What are your ideas then?
---
This is the kind of shit that makes me sick. Exploiting the game because you don't want to farm for the badges, so using a bug to gain from it. Just farm your own. Its as bad as duping, doing this.
---
In the pop boy at the bottom of the data tab is the clock. I've seen it mostly after 11
---
Oh my god thank you
---
hit me up. ign PeskyAlien
---
if this is the opinion of the fallout community at large, i absolutely apologize and will stop doing this. but i don't have the impression that that's the case.
---
in fact, before player vending was a thing, i saw sellers posting serums on the marketplace for 200 caps and specifically mentioning that they could be resold to vendors for profit. that's how i even got the idea to do it in the first place. so i thought this was common knowledge and that it benefited both the seller (they can make more money per day selling bunches of serums to players for 200 caps than they can selling them to vendors three per day) and the buyer (they're making a more long term investment, but can turn an eventual profit with minimal effort). it seemed not only like a win-win, but also one that was intended to happen. 
---
would love for more players to weigh in on the issue; i'm more than happy to admit i'm in the wrong and stop doing this if sellers really didn't intend for this to happen.
---
Gotcha thanks!! I’m not very good at these kind of events. I’m a rooftop sniper. I panic too much lmao
---
And grenades.
---
i don't see any reason this should inflate serum prices. sellers who raise their prices seem only to be doing so to stop reselling because...spite? if you're really pricing these things low to help other players (and not just because that's what their value deflated to once everyone on the marketplace was churning serums out left and right), i don't see what problem you'd have with people being able to finally make some money off of an economy that's broken for those of us who don't have tons of time to play.
---
Thanks so much!!
---
I want more things interactive in the vault 
---
Firt time i played i turned off all th lights like someone in real life
---
Heyhey if youre still lost, go out the elevator, fall down 1 or 2 levels and go under the ruble ramp. They can't hit you.
---
World spawn only, or if you’re lucky find it in a player vending machine or trading sub.
---
I'll give you 2k for it.
---
I'm on pc.
---
What do you mean?
---
That’s really amazing. I used to do that too but had to free up slots for other perks so I dumped a lot of supplies.
---
People shouldn't be able to hide in their indestructible camp in Survival for sure
---
I tend to use purified water and ionized meat and always seem to have enough
---
You can craft a high level version. Also I forgot that the quills can be made into a throwing weapon. But other than the event and making the weapon/upgrading it, I haven't found other uses.
---
More like, hey look a group of bos dudes hanging out lets nuke them haha just proving its not dead people just like to bitch and are anti-social.
---
Not a lot of nuke zones on xbox tbh but I have som ionized just in case
---
10mm handy
---
What "Dungeon" ? Ark pharm where it explicitly states it's just an event?
---
I've found myself playing the game less because I can't take full advantage of the legendary gear I'd usually farm up.  I used to just farm for hours and if I ended up with a bunch of junk I'd vendor it or just drop it for someone else to find.  But now that scrips are a thing the hoarding impulse I've tried to keep in check goes into overdrive and it just seems like such a waste to junk anything anymore.
---
It doesn't help that I'm STILL trying to unload a few of the three star weapons I picked up on day one on top of all of the gear I wasn't able to turn into scrip before and the stuff I've picked up since then.
---
I managed to fix it. Took a while though
---
I would but I don’t particularly have the Nuka Quantum stash anymore. Sold them when I had to do my monthly stash cleanout.
---
Just yesterday I was conduit for all three and died, and not did no one help me but someone took my junk immediately. Some people just don't want to win I guess.
---
Thank you so much! I never would have gotten through that solo. Let me know if you ever need someone to take potshots from afar for you and I’ll be there!
---
Apples has a pretty good list of permanent buffs. 
---
Add whiskey for +2 str. Psychobuff,+3 str. Deathclaw steak +2/Deathclaw wellington +3.  (wellington's harder to make). 
---
ribeye steak/grilled radstag adds +20 lbs. Mystery meat pie does as well, with a bonus +end boost.
---
With adequate planning these are easy enough to keep sourced that you'll have them all on hand as needed. Whiskey and psychobuff are dead easy always have on hand as they don't decay.
---
What platform are you on? I'm willing to pay 5k on PC.
---
The progress only triggers when you pick them up from a spawn position.
---
Got a video? I'd LOVE to see that! 😂
---
That's less than 150 a day...
---
I'll keep this in mind, thanks for the suggestions 👍
---
What stuff did you get from your 20+ runs?
---
Have a great time, and win some competitions (if y’all are doing any) 
---
👍😁
---
I'm against a no limit thing, however the limit really does need to be bumped up. At the very least to like 300.
---
The only 3rd effect that actually affects dps is reload speed, and even then it's not that big of a deal. I'd rather have weightless in most cases, sans like a harpoon gun or a dragon
---
PS4 here soz
---
PS4 that's what I wanna sell it for too
---
I hid in the elevator at the top while the robots killed the scorchbeast.
---
I went to an SBQ and it was only me and the dude that launched. 4k+ 5mm ammo in and we've got her down to 25% after the 'refresh'... server crashes... gg ...
---
Shopping... well... probably less stressful. :P
---
I got a 3 star lvl 1 hunting rifle on my new character.
---
Just a heads-up, two shot and anti armor are mutually exclusive. They never appear on the same weapon. 
---
Also two shot and explosive are both somewhat less effective than they used to be, though still quite good.
---
Experience, caps, the s'more recipe?
---
You forgot all the people tha tg just run around trying to take photos of the various scorched but never actually shoot anything...
---
I cant do it i'm a hoarder, but whenever anyone of my friends needs something I usually have it. Plus, if so run into actual new players not new characters, I'll usually drop a small care package for them with water, radaway, rad x, disease cures, and some home cooked meals for them....
---
Also, Marsupial gives +20lbs.
---
Goddammit, I've been playing the game for almost 500 hours and didn't realise you could join an event directly from the map...
---
Ty
---
How much?
---
got that already, bloodied build with unyielding is my go-to 👌
---
Darn. I run a vats/pistol build so I've been grinding for that one for a while. Good luck on your sale.
---
I get on I sell three 3* weapons and every day I have to leave 30 scrip behind
---
Hey OP, I contacted Bethesda and was told to wait 24 hours. They said nothing else besides pointing me to their forum and apologizing for the trouble.
---
Is this similar to your ticket response?
---
Cheers
---
Ah the Scroched-Rider Yao Guai. I've heard stories of those, passed on only by Level 300+ Vault Dwellers with C.A.M.Ps that are deep into Cranberry Bog.
---
I don't know, but changing the new player experience by making the "newbie zones" easier and adding friendly creeps isn't going to make the game better.
---
As bad as duping?
---
  No.
---
Lazy?   
---
Without a doubt.
---
I admit, it took me a few hours to click on that.  I know myself too well. If a game has a well timed comment, joke, or surprise I can be broken for hours. 
---
I was not disappointed. I may actually be able to hold some composure during the next play through to see what other surprises are in store.
---
How did you get the screens?
---
Needs more dakka dakka!
---
It’s a known issue. They rarely drop right now, and only in containers and super mutant meat piles. No one is selling them. Hopefully it’s patched soon.
---
You didn't miss much if it makes you feel better. 
---
If you really just have to have it for a collection you can get one on Ebay for like $20 bucks.
---
This is so fucking badass
---
Too many factors to take into account but I’ll guess you build your camp on a spawn point. Prob close to a super mutant area?
---
Ive seen only Bivs daily and Tadpols dailys. I wish it would contain every repeatable daily on the map.
---
It's coming.
---
bravo /clap clap good read lol
---
Who knows if it will ever happen..... but, dataminers have found files regarding legendary Power Armor in game files already. 
---
So could potentially be added some day.
---
I found one at camp venture in a container and one from a player vendor. Haven’t found one since
---
Ah didn’t know that. Thanks for the heads up
---
Biv is the name, drinking's the game. And *I* and in *first* place, doll.
---
yeah I could see that if i used ballistics. since i use power cores i dont store any ammo in my stash i farm fc generator to about 50 or so burn them up to about 10 or so rinse repeat.
---
Join a guild. You'll find a lot of BOS, Enclave and Raider groups on Discord.
---
But it would be better for us who have ton of leges. I'd be happier being able to scrap once a week all I have accumulated than I'm with the current system where I get the scrap 4-5 items a day and loot another 3-10 every day.
---
Not much troubles my mid forties vanguard automatics build but these guys give me grief all the time
---
Literally never seen someone shoot a flare besides me, lol.
---
If they did that, one duper could ruin the entire market.
---
That's almost the exact combination of legendary stats you DON'T want to see on a heavy automatic gun like the gat. Plus it's not even max level so it's not even a good gat. You might get 500 or so if that from the right buyer but honestly I'd just scrap it for scrip and hopefully you'll reroll something useful.
---
I’m a bloodied build and that pistol be an awesome setup to have fun with for sure!!
---
I would offer 7k easily 🤗
---
Been up there. Awesome place. Love it! Very nice and helpful captain.
---
10/10, would go to warp speed with if necessary.
---
Didn't even know this was a thing, very cool :D
---
The initial insult on me wasn't bad, it was when he said that he was contacting the "burn" ward that got me laughing
---
Yeah cuz they can code for THAT safely.
---
Are you serious? This literally hurts absolutely no one at all. It doesn't affect the servers or the ingame economy. There is 0 negative outcome from this. Stop being a crybaby because you dont have any friends to share it with you.
---
marsuprial, bird bones, jet pack I'm just throwing at the wall here.
---
Wishful thinking lol
---
Something is wrong when scorchbeasts are easier to kill.
---
Can you craft a fast travel mat like in FO4?
---

---
this is my current plans for my next build- one of the frustrations i have with snipers are the ghouls and fast movers that get all up in my face. I will be going for shadowed and chameleon light weight leather armor. will be using unarmed melee to deal with the ghoulds and crap that manage to get in close. my thoughts on using leather is that I should only be using melee sparingly so the low endurance shouldnt be a big deal. I might even try wood. pvp isnt really a goal just wanna drop big old stealthy crits on npc mobs.
---
They probably also don't know how. I'd rather take this cap for now than let the dupers launder their ill-gotten gains even once.
---
I always build in quiet areas and have no aggro until I put down crops, defences or generators. 
---
Now I plant crops when needed and stash once done, and only use candles and lamps for light.
---
same here, but if it goes unsold im not gonna hold onto it
---
Upping the scrip limit won’t make anything better. It takes 6.5 days to get max scrips. Think of all the legendary you potential have just to get the scrip. Then once you turn that scrip in that’s between 10 3** weapon of 16.6 armor pieces. Now take a moment and think about how much caps you can make in the same time (9k). Compare your chances of getting a good legendary out of 10 3** weapons of having 9k caps to try to barter with. Looking at it like this. It seems pretty reasonable to think your chances of obtained good legendary is high. Let’s go back to increase scrips. If they start to up the scrip limit it’s going to cause it overly easy to get a decent weapon. Causing player who kept playing to chase good weapons bored of a game that gives you glitched badge challenges.
---
Found him in game the other day, then proceeded to poo on his bed. Sorry not sorry (from a loving subscriber)
---
But is it worth it? Considering that 2* are 50 script and 3* are 100. I would assume drawing 2* is smarter but evryone is going for 3*.
---
Love her videos
---
Juice head is kinda cringey imo
---
always sounds great in theory then I see bloody build players get their ass kicked by rad roaches.
---
In “campmode” go to to floor decoration and it wil show you the jar to make
---
Id pay 10k and im on ps4 too if youre looking to sell it
---
I haven't played division two and what works for one game won't work for another though (like server wide). 
---
Even some things that work in WoW won't work in FO76. 
---
I'd only have it so it goes to the same server otherwise people would be constantly getting their hopes up that an event is up (like free range) only to find that due to them taking a few seconds the world they are now trying to join is full and they have to try cancel (which normally crash's my game)
---
Deathclaws don’t drop hide.  It’s so silly but keep at it!  Meat bags, tool boxes and yellow boxes in the bog.
---
Get rid of trash/non important enemy spawn points within a certain distance in around your camp. Fast travel points are a something needed as well.
---
Thank you, I try :P
---
I never mind cosmetics stuff in the atom store, it's a way to find MMOs and I get a lot of fun out the game. 
---
As there is no subscription in game like there is in WoW I just sink 7.99 for some ATOMs On the game on the first of each month as a self-subscription. 
---
It means they get some support and I get extra ATOMs to play with (I do a lot of dailies/weekly and in-game challenges too) 
---
I've though of some more robot ideas (Like a Doctor/Nurse that can cure disease and addiction, and one that will give a random mutation but can only be used so often). I'm going to create a new post with the added ideas if you'd like to be tagged :)
---
So its just simply a broken weapon like the old tse's.
---
A limit is needed, but it should me increased, maybe doubled
---
You can’t buy it from someone. You have to find it yourself.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is always looking for new Initiates. We have an active group on Discord. PM me if you're interested.
---
Tell me about it buddy basically only game I play since I got my Xbox 2 months ago.
---
i feel really bad for you.  your recent comment history frequently tops out at 1 "self like", but other than that, mostly downvotes.  You do not play well with others.  
---
And why I feel terrible for you is that you do not seem to realize it.  I am sure you appreciate any and all attention (even negative), so incredibly starved for any fleeting acknowledgement you seem to be.  I feel for you, even if I think you are a fucking garbage human being.  :D
---
Give me my Resolute Veteran and my Nocturnal 50cal and that Scorchbeast will be my next Scorchfeast.
---
Against a Level 60-70 Yao Guai, any weapon I have is about as effective as a pellet gun or a whiffle ball bat.
---
Mind you I am Level 82 at the time of making this post.
---
Go with where your heart says. 
---
My first one was in Morgantown because I am petty and remembered when Sanjay sent me on a run at Lv2 with Steelheart in a city full of ghouls. 
---
When I nuked it, I rejoiced. Then shuddered when I heard the responders alert come on. "Sanjay here! Letting you know that Steelheart is ready to come online!"
---
Steelheart got mauled by a ton of Bloated Glowing Ones and I walked away with a ton of Hardened Mass, High Rad Fluids, and Fluorescent Flux.
---
Hey it's me the guy who helped you can I have some payment please was going to ask but you crashed. I'll take $10,000 paypal
---
At the very least make it 160.
---
That sucks
---
Check here for people who’ve found it and go to them. I stood at a dead tourist corpse for 20 minutes earlier and three people got the camera.
---
I've never had an issue with him, but I haven't been watching him for long.
---
Most people probably have to grind to hit the daily limit.  30 1 star weapons isn't really easy to come by for a casual player.  50 1 star armor pieces is no better.  A lot of us saved up random legendaries in anticipation of the vendor, but I'd guess that most would be lucky to get a roll every few days by just playing the game.
---
Thanks I’m hoping to find that
---
Lol. If I saw the name, I'd know it. Also, I didn't crash until after leaving the team and later on drinking Vintage Nukashine. Nice try tho. 😜
---
that doesn't make any sense.
---
you get the plans for the armor before you have to scan the suit.
---
Ah, then it worked? That's awesome. Thank for helping out.
---
Ive spent most of my time on junk piles and lead deposits and rarely have to use the extractors because I am efficient with scavenging without thinking about it and can deal with not being on one for once so am quite happy to go without.
---
I saw this And I want to make the PRYDWEN
---
._. but Im too dumb I guess.
---
If your on Xbox I can repair it free of charge to 200% but I will not be on until 8am currently 1:48am my time if you want...
---
Unyielding Marine armor FTW. Perhaps urban/scout armor since it can be legendary
---
I moved mine again, after I had two concrete ramps sitting by themselves, unable to move them because of  **"Cannot place item: Intersects with existing object"** . The (not so) amusing thing was I had completely stored my entire camp, with the exception of these two concrete ramps... and I STILL COULDN'T F\*CKING MOVE THEM!!!
---
So, I just sucked it up and paid 40 caps to move my camp 5 feet. Concrete ramps stored. Problem solved... at least that one. The camp building physics and mechanics suck in this game... but, then again, it's still just coding.
---
Her drops have gotten awful. Like really bad
---
-*slow clap*- 
---
Bravo.. bravoooooo!!!
---
Do you use guns or melee? If you use guns, invest in gunsmith. If you use melee weapons, invest in makeshift warrior. You’ll be breaking stuff a lot less often.
---
If you only want materials, check here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/
---
Agreed. The nay sayers of this are only saying so because they are casual players.
---
I’d be interested in the maths of getting a ‘good’ weapon. 
---
Starting with a melee build for example. I want a 3* Ski Sword
---
There’s over 40 melee weapons, a 2.5% chance to get the weapon I want 
---
20 melee legendary effects(5%); 4 different major effects (25%) and 6 minors (16.5%). 
---
Let’s say I’m interested in 3/6 minors, 2/4 majors and 4 primary legendary effects. I’ve got a 2.5% x 20% x 50% x 50% chance of getting a good 3 star legendary. 
---
That’s a 0.125% chance of getting a good 3* roll, or 1 in 1000 rolls 
---
Even if I’m interested in 10 melee weapons, that ups the odds to 10/1000 rolls 
---
That’s a 0.125% chance of getting a good 3* roll, or 1 in 1000 chance
---
Even if I’m interested in 10 melee weapons, that ups the odds to 10/1000 chance
---
If more in demand effects have a nerfed RNG the odds get worse. 
---
Happy to be told if I’ve got the maths wrong, the Legendary Purveyor is not going to flood the market with god rolls
---
Omg this is amazing I wanna see for myself in game
---
I saw this some time Back and it was like wow 😀
---
Thanks for that offer but I've come to the conclusion i should have purchased fallout 4 considering how in depth my lone-wolf concept of my playthrough is going. I'm never on consistently enough to play this co-operatively. Thanks for the offer 😁 what do you do to get so much material that you can repair so thoroughly?
---
Do sbq and get repair kits i have like 100 already i dont fix anything at the workbenches anymore
---
Just unlucky.  I mean really, they're hurting themselves, that stuff takes up space in their STASH so they're hoarding crap.
---
This happened to me Friday night. I’ve had a reply asking for a screen shot of the error message which I did. I then had a message saying    they’re are a few people are having this problem and to keep an eye on the forums.So no help at all.
---
if it isnt nailed down, take it, scrap it, and store it for later. if your stash isnt 75% junk your doing something wrong. 
---
bulk what is not needed and sell it to vendors. keep at least a few bulks of everything
---
Excellent narrative
---
Make it an interuptable channeled ability
---
This will keep productively busy. Thanks chief 👌
---
Looks at self in mirror...
---
It is possible that you have your camp built on a spawn point. Normally, enemies will only spawn every few hours. However, if you also have a vendor active and running, every time a new customer either runs/sprints into your camp or fast travels to your camp, a new batch of enemies will re-spawn. If your camp is in an area capable of spawning high level enemies, then your camp, its turrets and a whole lot of other shit will get destroyed. I speak from personal experience. I built my camp next to a spawn point. No big deal as I used to rare;y ever return there, so the only enemies that would spawn would happen when either I arrived back, or a random player passed by my camp. Now, however, with my being an active vendor, I have visitors quite often, meaning I have hordes of high level enemies also reoccurring quite often. My inevitable solution? I will eventually have to move my camp.,, or stop selling stuff as a vendor. if you are in the a similar position, you may likely have to do the same.
---
there are two perks you can use. Fix it good, and Weapon Artisan. Fix it good is for armor, and Weapon Artisan is for weapons (obviously)
---
All that matters is that your mom loves me and we happy. Nobody likes their new step daddy and I understand that. Someday i know you will respect me tho...even if i have to beat it into you. Go pick a switch off the back tree ill be in shortly
---
Once you start rolling 3 stars, unless you keep them then you cut the grind to 10-15 1* which you can get in two/three W/S runs or frankly if you want to buy crappy 1* from player vendors for 80 a pop
---
Well that makes that quest seem even more fun....I am also a sniper type who doesn't handle preAsure that well...
---
I can see the two shot since it ruins accuracy in vats but I don't see how it can be better than Anti-Armor. Yeah the extra ammo is nice but your using more of it to put something down since your not ignoring any armor. I could see it having potential if you're running armor piercing mags. I don't use them on my handmades cause I rather have more ammo in the drum mags.
---
I'm ok with just 25 caps. I would rather them go to a good home to someone who will use them. I am at the point where caps don't matter very much anyway. I mainly only charge what I do because I know I need to keep some income coming in.
---
Farm, farm, and farm I completely farm everything everywhere I go unless it's something I know I don't need or use i.e. cloth and glass. What materials are you needing and I may be able to tell you a few places to go to get them. There are also 2 perk cards that allow you to repair to 200% fix it up for armor and weapons artisan for weapons. There are also perk cards that allow for slower deteriation of armor and weapons too....
---
It's to the point where it isn't really an option to have a preference. I take what has the most usefulness and use that until it breaks. Trouble is there are large gaps where I'm bare fisting it.
---
And Right duh. 
---
There are perk cards for this exact reason 😅 I've been waiting to get those cards until I'm level fifty because I didn't want to waste special points based on cards. I'll make a note of that.
---
But isn't a med box just a stash?
---
This happened to me. I had added a player and teamed up to help him out. He was only young so I said I’m going to have to delete you as a friend after I’d helped him. Deleted him and left the world and then got disconnected from server after trying to join a new world.
---
Oh good point I like those. I'll never find those in game scavenging will I?
---
That's awesome
---
Could be a simulation like in fallout 3.
---
Only from queen and encryptic
---
B... B... But I want pipe weapons! Ok, mostly I'm interested in 3* legendaries, but still...
---
Disclaimer: I'm not really a PVP guy and just did this for the first time today out of curiosity, and because he was being an assignment, so that's why I'm asking if this is working as intended or an oversight.
---
Thank you! I appreciate the reply on both posts!
---
Yeah perk cards are great  for this I realize. Where are the best places to farm?
---
its a common tactic for would be raiders. wanted baiting is used to lure in those who are cocky. currently attacking them allows for any team mates to retaliate, since you killed their chum. most of the time the wanted will carry next to no caps and no junk to avoid losing anything, and gaining a good chunk
---
Vault-tec scientist 1: d-do think we should stop gassing them 
---
Vault-tec scientist 2: nah they’ll be fine

IM A GIRAFFE 🦒
---
It told me that that always say its what's inside that counts, but all that I had inside of me was acute radiation poisoning.
---
It sounds like you’re not looting anything. I don’t know how you’re managing to run out of what you need unless you’re level 6 or something.
---
mostly depends on the weapon.
---
Harpoon gun? Yes.
---
Cryolator? Heck yes. 
---
Minigun? Eh... Maybe? 
---
MG42 LMG? I can see it.
---
Fatman? Maybe not.
---
I had no idea.
---
If you want a regular supply of adhesive you can grow,crops to make vegetable starch then scrap the vegetable starch down into adhesive, you’ll need to plant corn, Tato’s and mutfruit, this can be growing away back at camp while your out picking up junk to scrap for materials, as you work your way around the map always clear buildings and grab everything, scrap it at a workbench and then stash it in your stash box till it’s needed, before you know it you’ll have so much you’ll have to sell some to to keep within the stash limit
---
What grind are you trying to get around?  Grinding for better legendary gear is the whole game at a certain point, one way or another.
---
Thanks chief. Perk cards are a good answer. What about best places to go specifically to gather lead and adhesive?
---
Depends on what you want schools offer a wide variety of things. I usually hit both schools and server hop hit them again don't have to farm for a few days after that haul black titanium in ash heap or mine beside whitespings mole miners are loaded with it. Screws, springs, ballistic fiber at camp mcclintock, venture, and building in bog town with the drop down from roof entrance... If you need anything other than that let me know and I'll try to think of a place you could go.
---
Thank you with this God tier advice. It's like I'm playing a whole new game
---
Also using Pip-Boy while sitting, I just cannot understand why so can’t sit down and have a nuka chill
---
Lucky hole mine for lead and crystal (Excavator recommended, Acid required). make a farm for adhesive, Razorgrain, Mutfruit, and corn. you can use those to make vegetable starch
---
I'd sacrifice a small goat for some unyielding or bolstering power armor.
---
And power armor definitely needs chameleon, it's just such a shame that right now..... Power armor is only useful for radiation resistance to me. As I can carry more without it and wearing it ruins my stealth.
---
Happy to help, have fun out there
---
As above, super mutant meat bags are best for this in my experience
---
Not sure if you saw my reply further down but you do not have to work the teddy with the syringer all the way. Bust  out your strongest weapon and shred him down to almost no health and then switch to the syringer for the coup de grace
---
At least it worked that way for me with the kill-wolves-with-knifes-part
---
So I don’t need my 3000 lead...?
---
my camp is a modified variant of the floating camp design, it sits on 4 "legs" high enough so no one gets stuck under it
---
Thanks for your help Chief 👌
---
Ah. It was a fun experience but it seems like they should at least become Wanted.
---
Ah, it was a fun experience. But I think they should at least be made Wanted.
---
Remember kids dont feed the Yao Guai!
---
See originally I was grabbing everything but I was always so frustrated from being constantly overencumbered, so I started only grabbing tagged search items and that's probably what screwed me over. Either way though I'm constantly low on lead and adhesive.
---
Yeah, 2-3 Whitespring runs a day is definitely not how casual players roll in this game.  I suppose people might start server hopping to find nuke zones(I already do it for flux), but those that play 1-3 hours a day are never gonna hit the daily limit on scrip without having a stash of legendaries to cash in.  I probably have 50 3 star melee weapons to cash in, but eventually I'll run out and have to either buy or grind.
---
Well, tag lead and adhesive for search.
---
Modded rifles also weigh more than a FATMAN.
---
Thanks Chief 👌
---
I've sent a letter to the Pope for your admission to sainthood. Thank you 👌
---
Np
---
beware of mole rats in your farms. they can ruin everything if you let them.
---
Quad + perforating mag has inferior armor penetration to anti-armor + drum mag, but slightly faster sight transitions. I preferred AA + Stinging on my handmade but then I used semi-auto.
---
Two-shot is horrible.
---
Amazing! But how’d you get it to float?
---
any mutant camp in specific?
---
I put the note in my vending machine for 0 caps so people can send me the message "so and so bought you've been insulted"
---
Isn't the stealthboy mod (torso) basically just chameleon for PA?
---
BRO!?!?!?!?!?;?;?;!;!&amp;%%#-88 NO FUCKING WAY!!! 100000% not even a joke right after posting this a hop ONE MORE TIME. Find the pack brahmin but No vendor or eye bots. So I wait a minute to see if they spawn in later but nothing... Then I look back at the bridge and there he was staring off at the Poseidon energy plant like fucking Steve rogers staring at that lake then just as Cap bestows the shield to Sam, the not bestows the hunters longcoat to me. IM WORTHY!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂
---
I'll be sitting on the front porch waiting for them vermin. 
---
Long as it takes.
---
Yes it is but I'd rather have emergency protocols as the mod. And a chameleon piece of armor then other 4 unyielding. Just like normal armor
---
Where's bliv's best friend bricky?
---
That's what I've been doing I just haven't been coming into contact with enough. Adhesive I have plans for farm building now, but lead will just be constant raiding for supplies.
---
Yeah, Science perks should all be merged. Science
---
Science allows for all ranks of energy weapon modifications (ranks 1-3)
---
and a new energy gun perk would be nice, starting at rank 2 and going up from there
---
Mad Scientist would add 3 different effects, depending on rank
---
2. +25% durability on energy weapons
---
3. +15% energy weapon damage
---
4. +10% chance shot fired is recycled
---
Infact... If the helmet can be legendary aswell.... Wearing power armor would actually give us 6 legendary pieces.
---
In this sense the only thing increasing the scrip limit would help is players trying to exploit a new system. To a average player 150 scrip a day is a challenge in its self. Telling a player you can reroll one gun and one armor piece a day for a guaranteed 3*. That’s better loot rate than fighting the queen or fighting imposter sheep squash.
---
Not that I’ve heard of. Just people saying they’ve had some luck when searching them, but some haven’t found any. Supposedly this will get patched so they drop more often, not sure.
---
Can traps are your best source for lead at lower levels. You’d be surprised at what has lead in it. I pick up a lot of pencils and building blocks.
---
I wonder if you'd get more customers if you put your shop near the vault because it's free to travel there?
---
2am, I’m done for the night.
---
Not sure your level or where your exploring. 
---
When you go into repair something and you are missing a component, it gives you the option to tag for search. Then if you stumble on pencils somewhere there will be a magnifying glass next to it indicating it’s something you need. 
---
Early on, just pick up everything, scrap it and dump into your box. Don’t get too clingy to weapons. Have a firearm and a melee.  
---
  I can also fix some stuff for you and maybe be a bit of a bullet magnet. 
---
If you want to roll together tomorrow night... xb1-GT: gr8dne42
---
I'm annoyed that only one of the shotguns is useful because the others don't have magazines, and thus no piercing mods.
---
I isually justcstock to Morgantown, White Spring and Poseidon for my cap stash runs, and once a day I get one that is over 100.
---
Link to were you brought it from?
---
Maybe go outside and play a game of jump rope?
---
Can traps! Perfect. I know a few good places with lots of those. And yeah I noticed almost all the kids toys have lead in them lol
---
Say what you will about this game it still has a few good kicks in it
---
I am IMMENSELY impressed with this.
---
Thanks for the tips Chief. I'm a solo traveler and I was trying to figure out how the pros get along with their supplies. I appreciate you 👌 gn vault dweller
---
if your still basing pricing oof the reddit market you wont sell i dont think. so many peeps undercutting each other now prices will be rock bottom. although. with the scrapping of so many legendaries maybe the prices will start to go back up?
---
Literally the most logical idea Tbh,
---
Ok Derek R Thomas. :D
---
You should just buy it on the market. I've bought some as low as 1k but typically 5k.
---
If you want to run a mutant build there are detailed guide on the web. Briefly, yes you gain rads, about three quarters of your health bar should do it. You then put starched genes perk on and remove the rads.    Best check out a guide for locations and some of the finer details. For a sniper build there are 2 or 3 mutations you do not want..
---
LOL thats a lot.
---
Since I'm rolling for a gun to use myself, I think 2 is is fine and good. I'd sure love a B25 that's weightless or has reload speed, but just having B25 is well enough for me.
---
If you're rolling for things to sell, 3* is better. Though I'd try to only spend what you have to, personally. Once Bethesda adds the missing Murmgh's Mystery pick, that'll easily be more efficient. (Unless you're gunning for straight armor)
---
Not sure why you would say “R” unless you arrrr a pirate
---
I don't know how true that is, other recent online games I've played that use the guild system seem to get on with it OK. I think the main thing would be that it's opt in, so you'd be getting people who are looking to play socially, hopefully that would translate to more interactions via mic/ messaging.
---
My issue is I don't want to be running around and suddenly have some 14 year old chatting to me. Might sound mean but I have no interest in talking /playing with younger people.
---
Nuke zones.
---
I'd just be happy if there were times on events so you don't waste 30 caps going to one with 30 seconds left. Or if fast travel costs scaled to how much time remained. 1 minute left, 5 caps travel.
---
Yeah, i have a vague recollection as well. I'm not sure if that's referring to in game factions like the enclave ect or player made factions though. Think the details where sparse to non existent
---
If I had a better build budget my arena http://imgur.com/gallery/9N0ZF5m would be X100 better. However here is a shameless plug of some images of it. I used the ground to make sure I saved on floor pieces and this consists of only x10 foundations and 8 roof pieces a fair bit of wooden walls but its mainly lights and decor... if anyone has any suggestions on how to improve it or save some space it would be appreciated.
---
Mine goes pew pew pew...sploosh
---
Quad + faster fire rate? Personally I’d put that at the top of that list. Sneak on a MIRV mod and you got yourself a Kamikaze Kannon!
---
I got mutations healing factor - only carry 3 super stims for "oh S\*\*t" moments which rarely happen cause I use a vampiric laser gat. evrything else is sold for 5 or 1 per. took off traveling pharmancy and traded it for blocker.
---
If you can place the brahmin pen at your camp it's easy. Try to milk, store the brahmin pen, place again, try to milk again. Its tedious and probably took me a good 30 placements to get ten mil, maybe more, but every time you place it it refreshes the brahmin.
---
id rather use my instigating fatman
---
The damage is correct, you're just shooting that twice at once. 
---
So if your damage is 400, as long as both shots connect to your target you're going to do 400 x2
---
i pick up all of itwhen i loot. get full and ready to fast travel and throw away anything that spoils first then throw away heavy weapons I havent scrapped till I can get back to camp once I get back i scrap/sell  all that mess.
---
I just logged on to a sever with WS nuked and got 5 1* legendaries on the houses to the right. 
---
That took 15 minutes
---
Had over 30 lb of space in my stash
---
I use a gatling laser or plasma and it is pretty easy to kill actually.
---
sugar grove, national astronomers research center and charlston newspaper place, gears screws and springs. more than plenty.
---
I've seen it yesterday, took a quick photo while I was up there.
---
Amazing camp bud! [https://i.imgur.com/Ec9tjPV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ec9tjPV.jpg)
---
The most reliable place I've seen them is the Bos vendor in the Whitespring mall. He should appear next to the vendor selling all the outdoors stuff (not the one where the crafting stations are).
---
After trying Watoga, Sutton, and other Raider and BoS factions, I've seen it there at least three times.
---
I’ll try that, thanks
---
AFAIK pretty much only PC players have the experience your talking about.  I think most of the trolls live on the console platforms.
---
You missed an obvious one. My gunslinger uses a quad explosive western and it's a heck yes.
---
Yep, multiple times. Gunna try and find the other tourist.
---
I often kept wondering if i was just missing something when looking for a new perk card to pick.  I kept looking for a rifle weight reduction card but never found one, good to know i’m not crazy.
---
So assuming they're all weapons, 25 scrip.  Where you gonna get the other 125 as a casual player?  You could get lucky, but you also might not see a legendary in 2-3 hours of play.
---
Luck and or playing a lot. 
---
Level means nothing. I could start a new character today and it wouldn't change that I've been playing and looting since the b.e.t.a.
---
Quad double barrel gets you 8 shots for the price of two
---
What’s your point? 
---
That some players won’t hit 150 scrip so it doesn’t matter and the limit is fine?
---
Dang. Good luck out there
---
Roar! \*slaps\* Roar! \*slaps\* Roar! \*slaps\*
---
And we just get the rejects? No wonder my stuff from there has sucked so bad.
---
Honestly, I'm a pretty casual player and I have no trouble getting 60-240 worth of scrip per day (assuming I'm not server hopping) just with one run at the Whitespring. 500 should be the minimum scrip you can get per day if not more. 
---
Or maybe 100 per scrip vending machine. Which would be more tedious, but at least possible. Or allow us to scrap legendaries (any star) and receive 1 scrip as well as unlocking mods for those items. That would help offset any scrip reward limit from the scrip vending machine as well.
---
Spin up is just silly.
---
All I want is to shred people with a base damage minigun
---
This would make lice life easier. My 5.53 kills me .. a girl can only run to the prison and fire dept so many times in a day 🤣🤣
---
I continue to have the same issue but I have found that if I change the angle/ move around the object - the photo will register.  It sometimes takes 5-7 photos.
---
that and buying from farmers.  current rate appears to be. 1000 cps for 1.49 US dollars. 
---
everyones all "repair kits are pay to win!! boo bethesda" and in fact the player base will always make any game pay to win if they have free trade. 
---
" Does there's one way to have massive bottle caps in a very short time?" Many players may have this puzzle. We are here to help you solve that puzzle. " &lt;-- Does me think a chinese gold farmer Many players probably do. 
---
Developers are some of the dumbest smart people I know. they can write code and eliminate variables I couldn't even fathom. but they fail to realize the simplest truths and learn anything from game developing history. free trade = pay to win every time. there is no way to stop it there is always a work around by the farmers.
---
It’s called the land of super duper. In game exploit and glitches have led to a group of elitist. Who have 90% of in game loot waiting for the next glitch waiting to flood the market.
---
Hard Bargain perk recommended (unless you run a bloodied build with unyielding armor)
---
) pick up stuff... sell to a vendor ... 1400 caps per day easy (very little effort
---
Or... if you have plans for marine helmet or top-hat or civil war coat: craft (with Super Duper)... sell to vendors (takes less than 5 minutes).  
---
Or... grow crops (tatoes are best). Get Green Thumb perk. Pick crops. Sell to vendors. (Tatoes sell for 2caps if you have Hard Bargain or high Charisma).    Can also farm/sell purified water. (these methods are tedious)
---
Farming for legendaries and experience:
---
WestTek or WhiteSprings 
---
- you can also sell all the stuff you don’t need to vendors
---
I just want a crossbow sight ;~;
---
I totally agree. This happens more than half the time I go shopping.    
---
I think this also should be considered by those that build at cliff's edge. If I spawn at the bottom of your cliff, I ain't coming back.    
---
Full disclosure...my place is next to a river, and I have all sorts of jiggery-pokery, and I cannot stop people from spawning in the river.
---
Should get a PC bro, consoles are falling behind.
---
Like I'm running around with like 5 stimpacks, gonorrhea and AIDs, and 200 caps
---
As far as I know (used to have one) it’s a bug that Bethesda is aware about. They posted something in someone’s thread a while ago to say they were looking into it or something, keep hold of it and if it gets fixed, the value will rise!
---
I usually buy a g&amp;b 5 whenever I see it. Otherwise nope
---
Heck even if it wad just some sort of randomization when they spawn with alternative components, even if it was just legendary bots.
---
You can farm caps buy caps trade for armor and guns  do everything possible in the game but to get on the next level you have to exploit the game somehow.
---
Try deleting something in your CAMP and then relisting, it worked for me
---
typically if it reloads the whole clip at once, its okay/good single reloads on the other hand are iffy. like the single action revolver
---
That would make enemies at least interesting indeed
---
yes, same with the harpoon gun.. but divided in two
---
Also I read somewherr the liberators were meant to be able to replace the heads of other robots to control them. That would be a cool look even if it is just cosmetic.
---
If you paint it red it will shoot fasta'!!!
---
Again, a great idea that can and still be executed
---
Devil’s advocate:
---
The fat man is a big weapon but largely hollow.  All the weapon weight would come from the canister.  The true weight comes from the missiles, which sit at 6lbs individually.
---
The handmade is a thick dense piece of metal and wood.  I can see why it’s so heavy.
---
Uhh, I had a camp and Yao Guai would spawn literally next to it on every login and when someone fast travels to my camp.
---
Now with the addition of vending machines, some people would lure it to my camp and leave it destroy stuff.
---
I had to move my camp and I'm glad I did.
---
Thanks.. just sucks to know I could of got one is all
---
1str 15 per 4 end 4 chr 5 int 15 agi the rest in luck 
---
Get rifle perks stealth perks critical hit perks gunsmith lone wanderer tank killer gun fu adrenaline bloody mess tormentor 
---
Get a hunting rifle or combat rifle with suppressor until you can get a lever action. Get a chameleon armour piece.
---
It's a roll of the dice if you nuke the queen. Either you get a good lobby and she dies in 10 mins or you chase her around for 30 mins and she flies away, leaving you with no loot, no ammo, and no dignity.
---
Available?
---
Yessir
---
Psn i'll join in
---
With enough atoms, this could be yours......
---
My PSN is hillbilly_beast-
---
This! Last night she gave me a Fatman that I’m stuck with till it goes in the grinder tonight lol
---
Yeah, it's kinda silly. Then again, "swapping out a different receiver drastically increasing damage" is also silly, so.
---
...Ok, a few points. We don't know what your level is. We don't know what you consider to be a "the coolest gear".
---
beware of the red stained lips
---
Never thought of it that way. I just wish we didn't have such disrespectful individuals playing games. I think they should be punished in a manner that's fitting. Noting too drastic but settling.
---
Personally I’d say the other guy was a bit rude but maybe he just thought you really attacked him. Did you say or do anything to make sure he knew it was an accident?
---
I'm lvl 74, explosive two shot shotguns
---
Depends on how you quantify "better".  2 shot and anti-armor do more damage _per round_. Quad chews through more rounds but doesn't need to be reloaded as often. 
---
It's apples to oranges.
---
Fuck ya!!!
---
Well, for the same reason a guy with a hammer can impart more kinetic energy than a guy with a hand held nuclear powered rail gun. it just works.
---
Considering I ran into a camp that had a "glory hole", complete with a price list for specific things all done in the tiny steel letters, if that was the case they should have made those ones super expensive too lol
---
Ouch I put my spare beret up for 200 I should have asked for more lol
---
You probably caught someone in a bad mood. Most times I accidentally hit someone it’s been a non-issue.
---
That's weird, mine has been showing increased damage over a single shot since the last patch.
---
Na there gonna decrease it too 100
---
Appears that the guy in charge of multiplayer mechanics has been afk for the entire development of FO76... some flaws are so basic that my 3yo could have spotted them.
---
No didn't have my mic on at the time and everyone left pretty quickly anyway.
---
Definitely, absolutely, maybe, possibly......
---
Well everybody moaned when it was 400 and continued at 600. It’s all settled down now so I’d guess not.
---
Personally I’d rather see a CAMP budget increase now.
---
Just turn pacifist mode one.
---
it's the exact same as the vendor cap refresh time, 20 hours after selling something to the vendor at the last refresh.
---
example: yesterday you logged on at 6PM and sold anything to the vendor to drop them down from that that day's 1.4k caps (doesnt matter by how much), today the caps should refresh at 2PM. if you dont end up selling anything today until 7PM, then tomorrow it will only refresh at 3PM.
---
Hey. That's *super* hammer to you, bub.
---
I sell all ammo at 1 cap a piece and no one really buys it still.. I wish we could add bulk prices for things like ammo.
---
Yup. I don’t even know what I’m doing of late. Stash is full despite constant grooming. I rarely have more than 50 of any junk except of course lead and steel for ammo. That’s the never ending battle. Might have to give up my Vampire’s LMG. Makes me an invincible killing machine but man, I spend the next few days making more .308’s. 
---
We have this cap on the Legendary Exchange machine so if Whitespring is having a good day I end up holding a dozen items (all heavy) that I can’t do anything with. 
---
I have reduced everything in my vendors to the point where if anyone bothered to look they’d buy the whole lot, but I’m with the snobs who camp overlooking the Bog so a bit out of the way. Don’t really wish to move my camp to the increasingly trendy middle area of the map but... such is economics. 
---
I say bring in fishing to the game and I’ll just sit in my porch and do that...
---
Nice. There's a few areas in the map that let you build around and inside already existing locations. There's one around North, west right near Top Of The World.
---
Now you're getting it.
---
I'm thinking this needs at least 1701 upvotes, but no more.
---
Lots of people crying about this. The reason the rifles and handmade are so heavy, is that they hit like a tank. I’m pretty sure they could be lighter, and maybe nerfed some more. Your choice.........think hard.
---
Higher level players tend to do stuff like that. It's a way of giving back and helping those lower level or new players
---
I often tried to mix events and workshop defending and found its better to just hunt scorchbeasts for XP rather than get around other people with pvp enabled. if I go to an event and turn on pacifist I forget to turn it off and end up embarrassing myself. or I forget to turn on pacifist and end up attacking someone on accident. 
---
  With a shop I can just leave the pvp setting to on and go kill scorchbeast for a good chunk of XP and I never see any other players usually. heck one lap around all of the fissures is almost a full level. Drops suck but after awhile that stops mattering. 
---
OH to answer your question - yeah you should expect it but he was also probably being a bit rude, usually you can tell when someone shoots you on accident. I got jump scared running around a corner once and shot a guy in the face on accident. he then one shot me. it was to funny to get stressed about really lol.
---
I have definitely received level 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 on different characters, depending on their respective levels.
---
No flamers are a good option.....
---
you cant loot what you already own
---
It still happen ?
---
It’s almost impossible to mink a brahmin. Milking is another story....
---
Nope.
---
SBQ event crashes 50% of the time. 😡
---
My IP is correctly located in my country (which is kinda small) and I'm not using any VPN
---
Any other armor..... come on.
---
&gt;  Instant perma ban for scripping duped items. It's easy to tell if there are duped items in an inventory, even easier if you're comparing one weapon to a list of the players scripped weapons for the week. 
---
If it's easy to tell duped items you need to go work for bethesda, because they've already told us they can't tell what items are duped. The only way they knocked out duped items before were if they were stacked in massively unnatural numbers. Now dupers know that and they don't stack massive amounts of shit anymore.
---
PC! Will edit post
---
I like the “wanna group up” emote animation. The avatar looks like they’re saying “right this way” or “after you.” BUT it’s confusing if used out of context. I’d like another icon to be placed on top of the same animation, like they did with the “wave”/“goodbye” emotes.
---
If I've got 5 scrip left at the vendor I won't scrip an armor piece. I'll go farm up a legendary weapon just to avoid this.
---
There is not much end game, and alot of high level players have massive amounts of junk, or purposely find low level gear to give out. Just to help people get off to a good start. We want to see the game thrive and helping new players keeps them in the community. When ever I see someone fresh out of the vauilt I'm make a brother hood reacon rifle and drop it in the body, along with some ammo n water. Overall the community is great out there. And we just want to help
---
How do you guys manage stash space when your vendor caps are depleted? Do you just drop the common junk like steel/rubber?
---
What do y’all play on?
---
I hope they add this too. The avatar could look at his pip boy and tap it like a watch, the icon could be a clock with spinning hands ⏱
---
beware, it is a scam. the scam of preventing you from having to struggle to survive in this wasteland. to feel the joy of starving to death, dehydration, bleeding out, irradiated, broken limbs and unable to proceed only to fade away forever. 
---
&gt;!i personally like to stalk new players and give them basic supplies.. as well as a gift of some plans i'm not able to sell at my camp's store.!&lt;
---
The dead.. what now? Lmao
---
Get some weapon weight reducing armour
---
Mole rats called, they want their title back
---
I do it a lot. Even though i am "only" level 60, i have way too many weapons/armor that i dont use. And since these take a lot of weight in my stash, i give them to other players who might use them.
---
Not saying it's impossible to get a TSE (I've gotten exactly one in 173 levels). But they are rare, legit ways. Bought from dupers, for about 5-10k depending. That's...just a few days grind in this game.
---
Lol, that last part was a joke, and apparently went right over yours. :)
---
50% of the MF time. This is the one thing that really pisses me off. Dumping tons of ultracite ammo getting to her to 25% health then trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr screen freeze and you have to restart the game. 
---
Don't get this anywhere else just the sbq event. 😡
---
It's a fair response seeing as you have pacifist mode off.
---
Sheepsquatch been ok for me.
---
The limit will be due to server constraints, same as stash and camp limits.
---
Whitesprings or queen. Not really anywhere else good for do and weapons/armor.
---
Sitting right at the limit in a 3x4x2 cabin.  
---
Think something's bugged to be honest, as it shows 16% in storage, but all I have in there is a brahmin pen and 15 plants (3x carrot, mutt, corn, tato &amp; grain).  
---
Only got a basic water pump and no defenses - turrets or traps. 
---
Tried taking everything out of my store, didn't make a difference.
---
Platform??
---
Seems like crops really demolish your budget
---
he was a part of Rose's raider quest. he is rose's scorched raider boyfriend
---
Aww man. I can't wait for it to happen. I got my camp rebuilt and have players spawning right in the middle of all the vending machines. I have so many customers coming by it's crazy at times.
---
Cannot for the life of me remember him
---
keep pacifist mode on unless you are looking for a fight
---
Xbox
---
A serious case of CAMP envy here. Brilliant work on this, CAMP, while i can't make a simple box without intrusion from the landscape,and exceeding the budget. Well done. 
---
Meantime,enjoy this song in the spirit of the build. 
---

---
considering that the raiders where earlyish in the main story line, it is understandable. if you see him that means someone was on the quest and had to take him out at rose's request
---
&gt; My guess is the Purveyor isn't intended to be the primary means of legendary grinding, it's supposed to supplement it by giving you a way to trade trash for potentially useful stuff. Considering that, the caps prevent you from using it as your sole source of legendaries.
---
The way it works means it can never be the primary means of legendary grinding... You've got to turn in legendaries to get a reduced amount of them compared to what you turned in. It takes 2.5 3 stars to get one single 3 star back.
---
I think the scrip machine needs a small buff, 200 scrip a day would be fine and we can leave 3 stars dropping what they do currently. I get plenty of 3 stars already from them. I got 4 or 5 today with minimal farming, which means with very minimal farming I've exceeded my daily scrip limit.
---
Those pieces I farmed today aren't good enough to keep or sell so they're off to the scrip vendor, except I can't sell them all at once. Also I'm going to farm tomorrow. I'll never get rid of all these legendaries. I was really hoping to convert all this trash in my inventory, but I guess I'm shit out of luck. I'm already hitting the scrip limit pretty easily on 3 toons a day most days (sometimes I don't have any time to play) and still end up with surplus legendaries.
---
Funnily enough it's the interiors which run far worse than the world-space for me (on PC).
---
Kinda feel they need to do a performance pass over all the locations, even if it means stripping out a lot of the non-container junk.
---
The main things I want to shoot have so much armor that non-gatling plasma/guns basically do nothing so I don't mind doing a bit less nothing if it would weigh less.
---
The whole point is that you shouldn't need specific legendary effects to get what every other weapon type gets with perks.
---
Don't agree with the active passive perks slots, but we do need to bed able to spec and store 'perk builds' to quickly load a specific combo of perks... At Camp. SBQ killer. Day Traveller. Night traveller. Ghoul killing. 
---
These all require slightly different perks and it is a faff to keep swapping individual cards out every 5 mins.
---
Ye I know but currently that the only option
---
Ah right thanks man :)
---
I am looking for a PC player who's willing to die whom I can resurrect, of course if you need that I can die too.
---
Not in the game yet
---
Dude they add the armor but not the helmet 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
I'm going to try scrapping them, did scrap a few but stopped when it didn't move the budget bar.   Get all the resources back so doesn't hurt to try.
---
Yeah?
---
That’s stupid tbh thanks man lol
---
I do it all the time. Like people said it’s a way to keep the game going.
---
So you are saying that if I bought a legendary from a random person and it turned out to be duped I should be perma banned? I'm sorry but there is no logic behind that statement.
---
Oh ok np, some are in pc as they were taken from the dev room and duped but they ain't I'm console yet
---
Okay thx man!
---
I thought either I was going crazy or maybe the enemies were using stimpacks, thanks for helping me realize it's a bug.
---
Props I’d rather pay 25k or trade ultra rare items over doing another shitty badge or crappy “missing camper” joke of a event.
---
If you're gonna take our money at least fix the damn roads! So many potholes with stupid giant bats flying about I'm always late to work, I work at the Whitesprings Golf club. Someonee gotta clean all those meat piles up. 
---
Also need a HOA in my area, that floating camp around the corner is an eye sore.
---
i agree. 
---
not because of modding in the first place, which is still a huge aspect for me, since i have about 60gb of mods in Fallout 4. no, i want single player for Fallout 76 because having all these people running around the map kills the immersion. 
---
i actually came to like the NPC free world, gives me much more post-apocalyptic feeling than all the other Fo fames. but then i‘m in some factory, all stealthy, and some idiot in power armor comes stomping in and ruins the whole thing. 
---
i hate it so fucking much.
---
That will not be a fun experience at first! Thanks for the advice though👍🏻
---
I like it. 11/10 rating. I’ve really wanted some type of NPC that could guard our camps since the turrets are stationary and can sometimes act up. This would be helpful.
---
Good job dude
---
I'm thinking it should give you a warning saying that if you sell this item you will only get (whatever the remaining amount is).
---
I love this thing but the entire system is flawed in too many ways IMO.
---
It’s not available on Xbox. You can only obtain it on pc and ps4. It was taken from the devs room back in beta. If you scrap the helmet you automatically learn the plan to craft them. Since they were “in game” players were never punished for having them. Only pc and ps4 emulators were able to get in devs room. As far as Xbox goes wear the combat helmet with gas mask. Looks close enoigh🤷‍♂️
---
no, i saw a vid from Jug on yt about a round tower, and in the same second, i had that idea\^\^
---
Spot on

Around 10-15k
---
Was he at big Fred’s bbq shack?
---
It's normal for us to give out stuff. It's also a custom for us who have been playing a good while a d helping g out others who are low level or new to the game. We even give stuff away to those who need it at times. As long as it doesn't eat into our resources when we need it.
---
You will understand some day young grasshopper. You will master the arts of donating to other players and disappearing without a trace. 😏😇
---
Ah, well it's fantastic!
---
Symantics
---
bethesda needs to add travel mats right now.  the ppl spawn under the ship very often.
---
the easiest whay to get in is teleporting to a near location and back after it is fully loaded.
---
This game is wonderful we all roll out of the vault with nothing. We have the choice to live vender cap day to day. Or to find a way to profit off a free economy with zero check and balance.
---
I've come across hundreds since beta, but I'm not a Chem user or magazine reader, so I pass them by. Plus they're heavy. I don't want to drop it in my inventory, then search for it and read it to get a 15% buff against the Flatwoods monster.
---
You can buy all the flavors of Nuka-colas at the whitespring and get credit toward the challenge. A player-vendor is just another vendor. There's no guaranteed spawn there, which makes it no easier a task.
---
I grind for my caps. I have just about every piece of kit that I wanted in the game--bartered, traded, and paid for. If I want to kill a horde of super mutants for a copy of Scout's Life #4 now rather than pick it up and carry it for-freaking-ever until the very specific need arises, that's my choice. I don't consider it a waste of caps (especially when my vending machine keeps me dangerously close to max caps!).
---
The whole point was that the challange was merely to acquire a set of items. Sometimes they let you buy it; this time they didn't. I just want some consistency.
---
I love the freedom :)
---
&lt;3
---
Depends on your level and your build.
---
From personal experience - after level 35-40;
---
- WhiteSprings is better fro a melee build.  Loot all kills, grab everything possible (weapons, junk, tableware, glassware, clothing... ...).  Sell everything you don’t need to vendors before scrapping. Scrap remainder useful materials ;or after you reach the 1400 cap daily limit)
---
- WestTek for ranged build.  Gather all weapons and junk. If over-encumbered, scrap laser weapons first (they give plastic and other useful junk).
---
Use caps to buy whatever you need from player vending
---
The true Yao Guai experience summed up right here.
---
A) Not everybody has been grinding this game since Launch.
---
B) A lot of the time casual players at just looking to re-cap and clear up some Stash space.
---
C) There still are newbs looking for Lvl appropriate weapons/armor.
---
I try to set up in a low-med lvl area and sell simple things to help them out, Disease cures 10 caps, plans @ 25-50, recipes 15-20, any ammo that I don't use for my principal weapon at par, far better than some clown trying to sell a single star for 25,000 caps... but that's just my opinion YMMV ;-)
---
Where I'm from tapping your watch like that means hurry up/you're taking ages, definitely not wait.
---
I put a lot of free stuff in mine. A few stimpaks, disease cures, Radaway etc and plans that are common or that I have a lot of. I’m always near maxed out on stash so it’s easier than dropping stuff somewhere. Only annoying thing is when a level 200 will come and take all the free stuff. Yes like you need 5 mole miner gauntlet plans and 10 radaway. Now that is just being greedy.
---
I.E. it means nothing.
---
I'm still saving my only nukashine for when I finish the main quest someday. Hopefully I won't teleost forever.
---
How does thumbs up mean lead the way?
---
I'm too old and fat to jump rope.
---
Even though they're a major pain in the ass if you don't kill them before they get to you, I won't lie, I actually kind of enjoy stumbling across them. If only because they're a ridiculously good source of springs and acid.
---
I'm sorry it happened to you. I had it happen to me a few times but for sure the last time when I lost the rifle that I had favorited. Like you being favorited I was unable to drop it or scrap it so I'm not sure where it went. Be prepared for a bunch of people on here to tell you that you accidentally lost it or sold it or something because they refuse to acknowledge that it's a real bug and really does happen. Again I'm sorry if I had an AA handmade I would hook you up
---
made my day xD
---
ok. sweet tea on the porch?
---
It’s amazing to see what people do with it . 4 months ago I was living day to day with caps now I’ve got everything I could possibly think of in game along with 15 characters at max caps. Just from seeing and predicting the market
---
League of Legends
---
Hmmm, that sounds better
---
You think using insanely OP weapons is bad?  
---
Fucking commie, this is America bitch!
---
Yeah you are ignorant of computers. You can pretend you "fix computers" when you're probably nothing more than a geek squad kid.
---
This one recipe book would weigh 250 pounds with no way of reducing it through perks or armor  :D

---
You're not going mad. They changed it in the last update.
---
It was revamped a few patches ago to better reflect responder's last stand against scorched.
---
yep, they changed it to make it more accessible
---
no
---
So only hope is to try to find someone to save?:/ 
---
I always play alone. Damn.
---
This is actually a great story and would’ve been better for the game than the real one
---
id love it if the LMG got more mods, i made a few suggestions in another post. two possible receiver changes.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bngt7u/new\_weapon\_mod\_suggestion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bngt7u/new_weapon_mod_suggestion/)
---
Thanks. My first camp was near there and used to go use the vendor all the time. Thought what’s happened when I couldn’t in.
---
Too bad they already have. All they had to do Waze change a single mod on each duped weapon or armor to make it untraceable. So all you're doing is hurting legit players not dupers.
---
I'd be fine with it if they have special affixes that are more power armor focused. My suggestions would be along the lines of: Reducing durability loss, fusion cores last longer, you cause a mini nuke explosion when landing, unarmed attacks cause stagger, no swaying when using a scope.
---
I personally don't want to see or hear everyone just stomping around in their power armor, simply because all of the pieces on it literally provide the same exact legendary effects as non PA gear, but with higher DR and rad resist.
---
It is pretty funny how some of the most random items will go viral. And just as quick as it started the fad will disappear. You do have to be quick on the market which makes it a lot of fun.  Miss a few days and you might have a hard time giving away the same item haha
---
The the15thboss player was unable to login again after this happened. Hope they have got this sorted now. Are you locked out as well now?
---
Yes. Not getting any help from my submitted ticket but they have replied. I’ve just deleted it and trying a reinstall to see if that fixes it.
---
it's a mix of the right perk cards and legendary armor, power armor's only benefit's are the carry weight increase and no fall damage but you would struggle to sneak up on a deaf person in power armor
---
Yes, even the daily today (take a photo of a player in power armor at Charleston Capitol). It worked for my BF but not for me 😩
---
I cried when I got mine haha
---
More mods would be great too, but right now I'd settle for not having to grind lead for an hour to get 15 minutes of shooting
---
Nice try, but no i don't work for Best Buy
---
the only "kid" here is you- It is amazing how people I work with who play it on PC "have never had half the problems people talk about" not to mention others saying as much online and yet for you it is "it isn't the computer, it is all Beth's fault"
---
well, change the (suggested) receiver to 5MM, and just kill a bunch of minigun super mutants and boom. plenty of freeish ammo
---
And medic
---
okay so just like the earlier fallout games.
---
because i see everyone constantly running around in power armor. i always felt like the playstyle was rather annoying
---
My best gun is the handmade rifle i have the bp but where can i find more to scrap for mods?
---
My only worry with doing that is that the damage would get nerfed and put the LMG back where it was in the first place. If they change it to 5mm, but keep the damage where it is then I'm all for it.
---
Are you kidding me?   
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bma8pe/hey\_you\_youre\_finally\_awake/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bma8pe/hey_you_youre_finally_awake/)
---
Yeah that's not bad. Chances are the vault was definitely an experiment.
---
Plus every day is October 23rd too
---
While a cool idea, they said that its not instanced and that it would show up as an event.
---
Okay well you're now lead emote developer at Bethesda what would your " lead the way" emote look like?
---
Read the rules. You can’t post this here. Report it to Bethesda.
---
 Don’t other hunting down the codes and solving it by hand. Look up nukacrypt and it will give you the codes for the week. Depending on what you want from the nuke depends on where you want to drop it. Morgantown offers cobalt flux and a massive amount of ghouls for hardened mass, glowing mass and highly irradiated fluids.  Harpers ferry yields violet and crimson flux as well as either ghouls or mutants. 
---
whitesprings offers fluorescent and yellow if your hit both the golf course and waste disposal site right above it. This will give you ghouls and mutants. Of course you have the queen but the only loot she drops that is worth it are improved repair kits and ultracite power armor mods. I’ve nuked almost everywhere and those are the only places worth while. Although I did seem a video about nuking the nukacola power plant and the campfire tales event and it seemed decent but it relies on the event going on after you drop the nuke and not before. I’ve also dropped a nuke on my Blair while holding onto the workshop and that was fun, defending against waves of enemies in the nuke zone, It didn’t really give me a lot of loot more of a “well that was interesting but I’ll never do it again”  moment lol.
---
Sorry to hear that and hope you get back in. What platform are you on?
---
Do you have lots of friends on your account? I met a player and chatted to them and they had 300+. The only fix this player came up even after raising tickets was delete all friends and then it resolved issue. It was not me who had this problem so I can’t verify so I have to say do friend deletions at your own risk. But do think this player was genuine. I do hope you get a fix soon
---
Well thought out. I like it!
---
If you manually fast travel before it warps you again you can break the loop.
---
Ha I have no friends. Have about 7 as never accept request of people I don’t know and being female get quite a few weirdos sending messages etc.
---
And I’m on ps4
---
Get help -- I've done it a Watoga 3 times and top of the world once.
---
The Watoga robots just love shooting at it.
---
Huh?.. I don't know, just giving feedback not claiming to be some kind of expert.
---
I never use PA unless it's a dud SBQ raid lol
---
1700 hours in, expectations met and surpassed .
---
If you’re gonna quote me at least quote me verbatim and don’t twist my words.
---
But that’s exactly what you seem to like doing, twisting things to fit your agenda, like the data you provided.
---
Anyway you have fun convincing people of your argument, because I’m definitely not convinced.
---
500 atoms?
---
Pretty sure that's a skin for a backpack, not the plan.
---
the atom shop backpacks are skins for the original. you need the plans for the backpack to use the atom shop skins
---
Ok sorry, still where's my quest?
---
In my opinion, if one wants to avoid these situations, should have always active pacifist mode.
---
In any other case you're accepting PVP.
---
Some things you can do:
---
\- Scan &amp; Repair in Bethesda launcher.
---
\- Log out and back in.
---
\- Attempt to restart the quest by going to Camp Lewis.
---
\- Travel to Vault 76.
---
Thats cool man, now I'm inspired to pull down my campnand do something special...
---
I didn’t find a knowing volunteer, but I invited a new player to my team then went into the wendigo cave for him to be attacked by mirelurk kings. Poor guy
---
Im on PS4 and so was the player who had issue. I’m not an expert but when you add a friend on PS4 it does load into the Fallout 76 game profile as they are tracked in the social R1 button area. Therefore it does probably write data into the save file on the on line server. If you have a friend you can easily re-add perhaps you could delete  them outside the game. Then run the game - this may re-write the data in your server profile and maybe fix the issue. A long shot maybe but as long as you can add the deleted friend after it may be worth a try
---
Interesting science project to examine. I will power up a power plant in each mode and compare result. 
---
survival mode is extremely hit or miss on the pvp. I've dont things there and no one has been on and other days its been full on pvp land.
---
Quality post.
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
Supposed to be an Ash Heap event reward.
---
it may be harder to do, since a lot of the backpack challenges require you to have the Prosnap Camera. you can scrap and rebuild your backpack the higher level you get once you earn the plans though
---
the higher the backpack's level, the more carry cap it gives
---
Yeah that sounds like it would work. He was a young kid and only helped him after he said ppl kept killing him and he kept losing his stuff and caps. I don’t want to add him again as I’m an adult and shouldn’t be encouraging kids to talk to strangers. I did tell him this and not to be sending random invites to strangers. Just waiting on it installing again, see if that works.
---
 I think they can be gotten from the terminal in the room with the workbenches and power armor stations.  Right next to where you scan them.
---
Good luck
---
Lol cheers
---
Thank you good sir.
---
To learn mods you can craft the basic versions of the weapon and scrap them (many times)
---
Quad crossbow is better than anti armor crossbow
---
especially because most of the legendaries you get from the purveyor are garbage
---
I know but I've completed over 100 ash heap specific events and I haven't seen one. Also there were posts on reddit on different awards from events and it's not there.
---
Yeah the ones in Flatwoods are greedy with their milk ;) took me a while to milk them 4 times. Then just did the Free Range event twice and they all give me milk. Done.
---
What level are you and which system ?
---
No but you can have more than one backpack. I use High Capacity by default but I have it hotkeyed, I also have the Armor Plated backpack hotkeyed so I can switch between Carry Weight and Damage Resistance where appropriate, like during SBQ/Encryptid or PvP
---
Amazing skills man and work!!!!!
---
And thanks for making everyone's camp look like shit andhere I thought I was getting good at building stuff. 
---
No but seriously mind blow by your camp.
---
I love Power armor but legendary armors surpass it by far in end game. I would say power armor is most usefull beginning and mid game just burning through levels but once you get up there youre nerfing yourself a tad using it. I am level 230 plus. I use power armor and vamp laser gat, I am indestructible vs the queen and all her minions, however in pvp I get one shot easily. jump jets plus marsupial plus bird bones is why I get frustrated when im out and about out without power armor. the mobility is just too good. that and the yellow and black prototype paint job for x-01 is cool as heck.
---
I guess someone picked up that table fan right in front of your nose and no you are angry... XD
---
Could've been fixed. I was double checking the stats very diligently at the time. Wasn't playing much since, but I still recall 513 being the rad resist at the time.
---
*takes my seat in the front row*
---
you can surpass carryweight by far with deep pockets and the right perks armor
---
There's no level cap but going to some of the places it requires would get you murered a lot. It's worth picking up the quest to get it started though.
---
Yeah I got a standard backpack and the high cap one. Swap between the two...
---
Fridge backpack reduces carry weight? Hell no.
---
Unless it keeps food fresh for weeks
---
Well, I can’t speak english well sorry, but I know they are korean
---
This reply cracked me up. xD
---
On the way to the vault in the south? Yep a few days ago I stopped to get a photo of me in the cart as a tribute.
---
Sneak, Escape Artist, Chameleon. I'm pretty much invisible to all enemies most of the time. Power Armor has great damage resistance but you don't really need DR if you aren't taking damage. Stay crouched, try to avoid enemy line of sight
---
I am currently good with camp and stash limit sizes currently. a bigger camp liit and a large bubble would be nice but I cant say I want for anything as is.
---
They like the stagger against sentinel/cavalier in PVP.
---
heheh you pasted to the wrong one mate market is -----&gt;
---
Wonder if  a radscorp got inside the facility somewhere and they made the best of it. xD 
---
There were some parts that are natural cave in the vault.
---
Bet that was a rude awakening for what to expect out there, or maybe they thought it was an anomaly. Cause the Overseer seemed surprised by all the weird giant animals.
---
i like the toot toot horn noise it makes, but i run laser gat anyway.
---
YEEEHow?
---
Nobody can say they speak for the entire community, but as someone who sells cheap serums to help low levels out I'm super annoyed with people who do this. I've started yanking things out via my stash as the caps are rolling in, and switching to only selling one of each serum type at a time to combat this.
---
Getting 200 caps only takes you a few minutes of grinding so I feel it’s cheap for items that you currently can’t get in the game (except for the fasnacht man mask). 
---
Personally I really don’t mind spending a few caps on an item I dig.
---
Ah, it staggers like a shotgun but has the range and DPS of a Handmade? Looking at the Numbers the DPS should even be better than the Handmades ones. I'm starting to understand.
---
there's some powerful autism at work here.
---
thank
---
A few hits from a BE or AAE Railway (JE in my case), especially when its horrendous automatic piston recoil is controlled via vats, is enough to outright pulverize anyone in pvp. And that's relevant because all the level 200+ players are running around in end game gear, and a strong offense is your strongest defense.
---
Don't forget backpacks
---
Would you be down for another visit to the Capitol Building? I'm still trying to complete the challenge too
---
But the counter argument to this is if you are paying enough attention, the subs and player forums (and things like LFG on XBOX) are FLOODED with the exact same 10-15 items being posted by a LOT of different people.  Pay attention to what is being sold a lot, and you will lessen the chance of getting in shit by participating in the problem.  Having a bloodied explosive laser or handmade or whatever the hell, it’s not normal that hundreds or maybe thousands of players possess as many as they do.  In the beginning yes it was a little different to be able to tell, but now it’s not.  It’s perfectly simple to do some research on something you want to buy.  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
But compared to a Light Machine Gun, it's DPS is still not very impressive.
---
In theory, but the reality is more like the cat spawns in before the foundation, gets stuck then despawns or permanently dies. I always keep mine outside and away from foundations to prevent this. Maybe it's not as buggy anymore, but I don't know.
---
Oh, now I get it. In my head it sounded like it would include ranged which was confusing to me. Thanks
---
Yea! Ill be home in about 40 min! Send a friendrequest :)
---
PC
---
It's just bad manners and/or they are simply a dick.
---
Hitting someone else in an event is part and parcel, most people don't want to hit another player but exploding guns and melee can easily deal unintended damage.
---
There's two "serrated knife" mods available at various vendors. Look for the one that says large or big. That's for the Bowie.
---
Really do be careful what you wish for. As yes we need a better build cap, we most certainly do not need more people spending their money in the atomic shop for overpriced stuff. It's your money but I would rather not spend it at all
---
Over 100? I'm sure I've got you beat by a magnitude....
---
I've never found this or the Ultracite Gatling Laser (Cran. Bog reward, supposedly). :(
---
A friend of mine just found the Cryo Mine as a Cranberry Bog event and I've never seen that before. RNG. :\
---
yup - sigh -backpacks look cool and fun but I would rather keep my jump jets and smexy x-01 - I mean I am nerfing myself and all by a little bit. but after a couple hundred levels its not like anything can hurt you but other players anyway. I am already rich and have tons of mats and caps. so the carry weight isnt important to me
---
One trip through whitespring will easily grab you the 10 1*’s you need to complete that.  Or keep a number of 1 or 2* items to balance it out every day.
---
shrug emoji

The Railway is so easy to maintain. Besides, you can't put a long recon scope for incredible vats accuracy on an Lmg. Sometimes it's as easy as whoever sees who first and is quicker on the draw. I love my Lmg, but I wouldn't pvp with it as an opener. My JE Harpoon gun hitting at 1320 at the moment on the other hand will be what I hit you with first.
---
What could be better than a two star furious pool cue?
---
I'm curious, but does this skin make every armor that it's put on look the same? or are there variations of it like the Mothman skin?

---
Yes, I thing so,same looking ,Every Power Armors.
---
How do you get the camera? Thanks for the information
---
I rarely fast travel to other camps as I have spawned inside the foundation and can not move far too many times.  I just go to the nearest map point and wander over from there.
---
Oh.. thank you for the heads up. Hard pass for me then.
---
Okay thanks for the info we will probably give it a try hahaha
---
Your intuition is correct, the weight of items in the stash seems to be the original number, not affected by any perks.
---
Well I'm never gonna bother with doing research on the things I buy (not an active buyer anyways).
---
If I buy something from a random person I meet ingame I shouldn't be risking a ban. You can't base a banning system on whether or not you are paying attention to forums and subs on reddit. There are too many people that are unaware of the trading community so that wouldn't work. They will have to find another way around the problem.
---
Same problem. So close to tossing Xbox out the window (3 times now hanging up after the 4th bullseye).
---
Photomode of course
---
I wish people would stop giving them attention they don’t deserve.
---
You would do, or a jet pack
---
I love my LMG too (AA25), I still cant decide if I go Automatic or Heavy (startet with shotguns), right now I'm switching all the time, but it's time to decide (have 112 perk points left :) ). I hoped the railway will speed up my decision. :)
---
When I travelled to it I ended up on the pylon, then jet packed over
---
Yup.
---
FO4, you mean?
---
I think I'm going to skip refrig. High Cap, Armored, Standard are doing pretty well. I'm not sure the next one I want.
---
I'm guessing an oversight
---
the camera will be on the dead body of a tourist wearing a nuka cola t-shirt near some of the tourist hot spots in Appalachia. it is random each server/instance. you will also get their bucket list to complete as a side quest once you fix the camera.
---
So you can't learn them then, just buying them? Also, if you know...what vendors would sell them?
---
I feel some information is missing here as that doesn't just happen.
---
Good luck and have fun. My main is a heavy gunner, my alt is auto rifles. Can you guess what either of them use? ;)
---
tell me and tell me why please. :)
---
it does, but the in game timer is much faster then IRL timer. you can check the in game time on your pip boy menu's data section
---
I think I got both serrated versions at R&amp;G, but I've seen them both at the shopping mall in Watoga and Harper's Ferry too. My main can't mod the Bowie without purchasing the mod. My alt learned the plan from a treasure map cause she's stupid lucky like that.
---
Here is a question to ask:  
---
Why would any player severely undercut the the NPC vendor prices when it requires pure or stable nuked flora to make and they can simply sell three to clear out a vendor themselves?  
---
Serums don't just give you a mutation, they enhance it if you already have that mutation- and people who have learned these serums are rarely in need of caps
---
You didn't read, nobody is talking about duping, 150 isn't enough for anybody.
---
ooooo! good thoughts! this might also explain why everyone was so suddenly turned into a scorched, ie: they werent.
---
It happened for me. I don't have speed demon or any diseases
---
My main started shotguns until level 44. That's when I got a TSE .50 cal. 170+ levels later, I just have a serious heavy weapon collection and it's a hard habbit to break. So, why break it when I can make another character. My alt is level 95 and it was just easier to make a character designed from conception to use auto rifles.
---
The only way around the problem is something they’re already doing.  I think people don’t realize what the purveyor is truly meant to do.  It’s meant to close the gap on inaccessible items and make them more available to the masses.  The market will slow down, and then they’ll have a better idea of where items are really coming from.  And no, because you bought something you didn’t know was duped you should not get banned, I agree.  BUT, what I mean is anyone who is playing this game knows what weapons are meta and I don’t think some window licking level 30 who just started last week is going to know what a bloodied explosive laser rifle is.  Therefore the ones who DO know what they’re buying are part of the problem and shouldn’t go unpunished.
---
Thank you so much for the post ❤️
---
Amazing ❤️
---
Oh, I know that sound. It's the sound of another player taking away my opportunity to get legendary loot.
---
I think, and I could be mistaken, it has always been this way because weights are tied to AP cost in Fallout. I remember that being a theory a while ago, anyway.
---
If that's really why they did that with rifles I don't see how they could ever fix it outside of a Rifle weight reduction perk.
---
Fallout has some weird ways of managing things. Another rifle-ism weirdness is how do auto Plasma and Laser rifles have more recoil and less accuracy than a handmade? I think rpm is somehow tied to recoil there.
---
You can do the same with harpoons. :)
---
Very much appreciated! Someone really should update the various wikis...
---
I feel like I'm getting too old for the griefing bullshit to deal with. I prefer doing co-op with my buddies, I play the game actively with 3-4 other active friends and we're high level, but we have yet to touch Survival because we're not much into PvP. Do you think we're missing out?
---
I read "gimp" so yeah i'm stuck with that image.
---
It seems prices started to rise again within the market communities when bot vendors started to pay a decent amount for them, then came player vendors. 
---
Prices aren’t increase out of spite but why sell under bot vendor prices when people bulk buy what your trying to give out to a community to use, not to resell. Giving newer players a chance to explore the world that mutations bring. Most of the community of newer players don’t know how to raise caps fast nor turn a profit hence the reason serums were sold at below cost. Unfortunately these opportunities are taken away from them from players looking for that quick profit. 
---
I myself could do this but have found many other forms of gaining caps, it’s harder to find items to buy to keep below the caps limit.
---
Each to their own I guess. I’d rather give back to the community and help the beginner to intermediate players
---
Ah you see comrade, it is made out of the finest stalinium and stalinwood. Quality comes at the price of weight.
---
Also comrade, you can forget about the gym. Carrying this baby around will make you very stronk.
---
Honestly, I don't like the idea. More often than not I leave a C.A.M.P empty handed. I'll always try to buy something, I don't want my journey to have been in vain, but it's not always possible down to what's available to buy and whether I agree to the set value. It would irritate me knowing people are profiting directly from my window shopping. 
---
I also feel like I should be the one getting paid for becoming a piece of rebar in a foundation. C.A.M.P loading isn't very consistent... Sometimes I can get clear, other times I get stuck. It's irritating either way and I don't necessarily want to reward the owner for the experience.
---
I think they might of done that on purpose cause people would farm it for all the screws they give, but if you jump high enough you can grab them from over the invisible wall
---
You missed *character face plants and camera starts rotating* as the fourth step.
---
It help to have marsupial too
---
He should set his microphone to area and put on some engine sound clip from youtube and let it repeat
---
nope, you can use the terminal and re-read the plans again.
---
The plans aren't locked behind any quest part, merely on an unlocked terminal in the basement of the building with the fusion reactor in it.
---
I'm convinced someone accidentally dialled up their attack speed too high
---
Ouch!
---
can you do a video clip and show us what is happening?
---
Science Master does not reduce degradation like Makeshift Warrior and Gunsmith. It only moderately increases the CND bar - not quite the same.
---
The Science perks have an added benefit of making energy weapons cheaper to craft.
---
I want to talk about the recoil on semi and auto laser and plasma.... A handmade rifle has none. An assault rifle has little. A submachine gun has a bit more.
---
A laser rifle? Off target in two shots. Plasma? Have fun shooting the roof. Why?
---
Also, try ghouls. Run Sons of Dane, for example, and you'll at least get a plasma core. No idea why that's a thing.
---
I love the rusted mottling on the chest panel.
---
I just want it because i like the gun and it has decent damage. But sadly it's very good for pvp and so it's hard to obtain
---
Sounds a bit like the miss of slow metabolizer perk or/and you've had the parasites disease.
---
One mans trash is another mans treasure I guess but I tend to shop around whitesprings the mire or cranberry bog and see all sorts of good stuff, I figure if someone’s living in cranberry bog they’ve probably got nice things and a pretty good arsenal lol
---
As far as end-game is concerned... I rarely go to SBQ anymore. I always feel empty after the fight... both spiritually and via my ammo bags. I feel like Bethesda should add a new piece of loot to the Queen: A t-shirt that says, "I fought the Scortched Beast Queen and all I got was this lousy T-Shirt"
---
Personally, I'm having more fun fighting Sheepsquach, renovating my base to accomodate the vending machines or trying to complete scout challenges and new events.
---
Just outta curiosity but what's the point of keeping a Standard backpack when you already have ones with advanced mods?
---
Wow man, thank you for this very in-depth comment, you answered everything that i wanted to know. Thanks!!!
---
Always a 50/50 gamble visiting a camp on the Western side of the map. Are those 10 weapons level 50 legendaries or simply low tier weapons intended for people levelling up? I always try and find the owner to check their level.
---
Why swap between high capacity and regular capacity? Any particular reason?
---
The further they stray from 3 the more unsatisfied I'll be, that's just me but this is fucking annoying to everyone I'm sure
---
You’re right, maybe i should just wait for E3, and see what new they might announce. Thanks!
---
So pew-pew tops toot-toot...?
---
I have armor plated and no reason to do any more scout challenges.
---
I'm not sure. I wish it was higher because I really want to see something other than wood armor.....
---
But quite honestly it's kind of nonsense to spend an hour collecting legendaries to hit the cap when you could invest the same into getting more quality legendaries without Wood armor, urban scout, etc. It's trivial to hit the cap with trash legendaries, but the return feels like more trash.
---
The Purveyor reminds me of accidentally farming Drills again.....
---
Level 350?? What?
---
Carry weight.
---
Armor 30, Standard 60, High Cap 120.
---
I like to use High Cap as a crutch when I end up over encumbered and don't feel like going home to stash for a bit longer. It's like having a permanent Buffout/Grilled Radstag except the penalty sucks.
---
tbh they should raise the base damage and make the "fusion cell conversion" do the damage it does normally now. 
---
and have them in the Legendary pool
---
Oooh, that's why it worked that one time for me. I thought they fixed it... but then the next vending machine didn't work again. Good to know how/why. I'm going to have to make sure I only visit occupied camps from now on.
---
So I must to ask you before comment, do you have parasite disease or Speed Demon mutation?
---
I don't know that one but might it be something more rapid but less damage with some effects?
---
Ah I see. I have yet to acquire an advanced backpack mod but I'm shooting for the high capacity. I'll probably ditch my standard when I do though. I'm a sucker for more inventory space...
---
no not really pvp is stupid in this game - the fights are always over super fast, I have about a 30% win loss ratio when defending my workshops. every win has been on the return after theyve one or two shot me. the only time I have managed to kil people who took my shop by force is by hitting them when they werent ready. seems like for most player who pvp its whoever gets off the first big shots.
---
I wish this was true so I could (ab)use mules but it isn't. :\
---
You have a chance at level 50 but it isn't guaranteed at all.
---
That's because of the Glow Sight perk.
---
Dude, I can help if you’re on? I need to do the swimmer revive in water, let me know if you’re about
---
All junk (or items) are useful to someone., 
---
some specialise in obscure eg the junk required for recipes that may also break down in “scrap all”. 
---
(Royal jelly, cooking oil, bloatfly gland, bugfly proboscis, etc)
---
Or go more common junk very often used (ranging from 1-3c/each) no need to bulk.
---
(Plastic, aluminium, lead, acid, cloth, steel, gunpowder, adhesive, screws, nuclear waste, antiseptic)
---
If you need it, chances are everyone will.
---
Then most common ammo for 1:1 is shotgun and 5.56
---
45 and .308 may also sell at the ratio but less often
---
Kindly ask someone to borrow the plan. It's glitched at the moment. They can place it into a container and you can pick it up to autolearn it without consuming it. Then give it back. All done.
---
I really like the armor pack for flat +90 DR. High Cap is 0 DR, -60 ER, -60 RR - not the best thing to wear long term.
---
farmers sell things for cash on the internet. 1000 caps is 1.49 US dollar currently, its pay to win and pointless, a normally played charcter without god tier gear is just a loot pinata.
---
I've killed myself collecting water... Some alcohol gives you a false sense of security with an HP buff. When it expires, your rads sharply increase. Better hope you're not collecting water at that moment...
---
You guys are not that great either, we’re always kicking you guys around.
---
I'm level 350 lol
---
Yeah I have heard something about that glitch, makes sense why I saw someone's vending machine selling the High capacity for 2500 C.
---
Did not know that it gives you energy and radiation resistance penalties though... shit. Thank you for the heads up.
---
Oh ok sorry gotcha. 6:26 am in the East Coast of US and I have yet to sleep. My mind is mush
---
My CAMP spawns you on the road nearby.  Testedit with my kid to make sure.
---
Fact #76: Yao Guai. Yao Guai never changes.
---
I’ve been wondering about this same thing, I’m so torn between getting the lead lined in the hope of some ghoul protection or the fridge so I can unequip good with salt and maybe go for ricochet instead, if you go for lead lined pls come back and let us know how you get on with the whitesprings ghouls and how useful it is and whether it’s a must have, I’ve only got the 8 badges so it’s one or the other so definitely following your post to make sure I pick the right backpack lol
---
Fact #6: Albino yao guai bear claws have great aphrodisiac properties. If you are a masochist.
---
How did you build this
---
But why would you leave everything that you possess at a place that you wil never return to?
---
Vampiric laser gat - I still suck at pvp but I can tank the queen and the entire bog at once with my face without so much as using a stim pack in x-01 power armor. and I look cool as shit doing it too. gonna take more than a whistle and damage boost to give that up. :P
---
I was actually really angry when I unlocked it and learned about the penalty.... Most of my points were earned in challenges and not Campfire Tales. I would have never bothered if I had known. I hope they drop it to a more reasonable -20. That -60 RR is murder to mitigate.
---
Now it's just my last ditch replacement for whiskey/Buffout/grilled radstag for a carry weight boost to fast travel home/to the Purveyor. I don't use it for anything else. :(
---
Does the lead lined stop you getting any rads from glowing creatures and Whitespring ghouls or does it have its limitations
---
It’s required for one of the Possum Badge challenges, I believe the rail enthusiast one. You have to kill a load of enemies up to around 50, plus add mods etc
---
Then don't do that 👍
---
I used to feel guilty for dying stupidly. I would just run head first into danger and die stupidly, flail my arms until someone healed me but felt guilty about them wasting a stimpack when I did something stupid.
---
I don't feel guilty any more as any time I do die, it could be to help someone!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe theres only one other skin you can get with badges that I know of.  Its the possom skin which is just darker than the tadpole skin, their pretty much identical besides one is dark and one is light.... pretty lame tbh.  All the good skins are in atomic shop it seems.   So yeah I wanted to see for my self so I used some badges on the skin.  I pretty much regret doing it, but oh well.
---
 I'm LvL 45 and struggling on a couple of bits.. the first aid thing is pretty easy to do though.
---
Sad that that's what it's become. My friends and I are in our 30s and we're fans of the Fallouts since 3 and we just play it like we were playing the single player games, only together. I'm 400+ hours in, level 110 and haven't delved into the deep min-maxing and aspects of god tier status scenarios, and I may never really get into that part as deep as some others would. All the duped guns and gear from before, all the black market deals going on on the internet, just feels like people that partake in that are just ruining what made the Fallout series great. People I feel are treating this game like a griefer's haven, with folks on both sides just duking it out with impossible modifiers.
---
I feel kinda stunned when I realize I'm a small minority at this point of players at my level who actually play the game in a much more subdued casual way.
---
They’ll be stored
---
Lol have the same problem
---
High capacity reduces your rad and energy resistance significantly... By 60 points each. The standard has no drawbacks and give you an extra 60 pounds.
---
Im on now :) Just hit me up!
---
Had this also!i just selled it to a vendor because i reeeeally needed the space
---
I am level 238 - I still use x-01 power armor and gave up on pvp - you are correct about the strong offense being the best defense for sure I kill some peeps that took my shop but only when I get to attack them first and they aren't ready.
---
Why don’t you rent it? 
---
There is a market community for FO76.
---
I hadn't yet, but I went the route of assuming this was the case. I used my explosive weapon to take him down to no health. The problem was that, even at low health, all my weapons do a good amount of damage, so even that last five percent or so was one-shot kill territory. But it took forever doing 5 damage at a time with the syringer. And then the low level yogi startled me and I killed it with the wrong gun.
---
I ended up getting lucky and running inside the cabin at middle mountains, the 78 glowing yogi followed me up on to the porch, and froze outside the window. Not gonna lie, I did half expect it to CTD as soon as I killed him again because why not.
---
For the wolves, I did the leader of the pack event, so they spawned in at level 10. I happened to find a level 50 bowie just before that, so they were a piece of cake.
---
Reddit auto mods will delete any links but search for T-51b on Ebay
---
Whether you’ll be able to place from those stores plans is a whole other ball of wax.
---
Now that I know this, I may just stick with the Standard. That's ridiculous. It's not enough that they make us go through hell and back to acquire the badges through Challenges / repeating the boring Campfire Tales a million times, but they also have insane drawbacks like these. WTF Bethesda.
---
what system are you on?
---
whats it called
---
Makes total sense. It's horrendous. I think I'll wait and see if they change it up before committing my hard earned badges (I'm at like 5 P. badges now)
---
It doesn't do anything but hurt guys running one character.
---
The...who now?
---
Well, the good news is the 'revive an ally' bit that's been caausing a lot of grief should be easy ;)
---
That chick with the Machete outside Vault 76, doesn't her body despawn whatever items we put in there? I feel like I've left stuff in there and it disappeared several moments later. I was watching from the corner to see if anyone had come by to pick it up, and they didn't.
---
I hope so. 800 still feels like nothing to a hoarder-mentality player from the days of Fallout 3-NV-Skyrim-4
---
well thats impressive :D
---
legendary bone club is the only other thing i know off
---
PS4
---
I’ve rented mine for 1k, i think this is the normal and fair value of renting.
---
If you're playing Adventure mode and do not care for PvP in this game, it's pointless not to have Pacifist mode on. I'd do that to avoid accidentally hitting people.
---
i really hoped to get hands on a usefull alien blaster so thats sad
---
but the addition of the boneclub seems really cool i need to get hands on one of these
---
Thank you!
---
if yo uwere on xbox i would have made u a flaming staff
---
👍🏻
---
Do a search for find the tourist, there is a list of locations to check. The tourist is on the map at one of the locations
---
Damm righteo cheers
---
Okay sweet thanks
---
I feel the same way, I want a legendary alien blaster too :(
---
I believe every player coming across the sofa in picture 3 takes the very same photo ^^
---
Hear hear! I really want to use the alien blaster but even at level 50 it's nigh unusable outside of the forest region.
---
I think that it’s unfortunately more than that in my case, since ammo is gone.
---
I was thinking the same thing, but did it anyways! The same with Morgantown sign.
---
Yes, however the ammo is gone.
---
Mostly we don't know where someone spawns unless we see it ... had someone spawn inside the building but then have to guess the exact spot. No I don't have a mic and no I don't have someone to test it with currently
---
Fun theory, but Appalzchia isnt north of the Commonwealth.  It's very south, and west of the Capitol wasteland.  And the scorchbeasts, stirywkse, presumably die off without their queen.
---
so i could be online soon what about you?
---
Hotel?
---
I am at 900 hours for every person who has griefed me I have interacted with or been around hundreds of different others. I have saved and stimmed many and been stimmed by many strangers. you dont notice the neutral and good players as much because each server has such a small population and you just dont interact with them as often whereas griefers go out of their way to run people down. you are not in a minority at all sir. the minority is just so loud and obnoxious they leave a bigger impression.
---
May i ask where you get the stats on the perforating mag?
---
If I get stuck in your foundation or a locked room I have to fast travel away to get out. I'm not coming back to spend more caps. It's just annoying.
---
So of course, much to my own horror, this happens at my camp roughly half the time. I have no way around it as I'm not moving. I love my spot, it's never taken, and I've spent my entire budget building it for the sole purpose of vending. When you load in you're actually fine--if you don't move and let it do its thing. If you run forward you pass into my stairs and foundations and you're probably not making it back out.
---
I can take the lost sales, but I'm always bummed they don't stay for a tour and gift.
---
The best thing I found is pick one of the spawn locations, go there and server hop in that one location until you get it. 
---
I have had most luck with Colonel Kelly monument.
---
What perk gives 25% increase in fire-rate?
---
Last night I was at Black Water mine tunnels clearing out the remaining Mole Miners after doing Uranium Fever and ran into a Glowing One with no arms named Freddy Lange.
---
Isn’t that the Wavy Willard kidnapped kid?
---
i dont get this games obsession with limits... Everything is limited and caped.
---
How tf u have so much camp capacy xD is it possible to higher it ?
---
Handmade is one of my favorite weapons in the game. I'm not a huge fan of the big guns. I agree with this, there needs to be a perk card for rifle weight reduction. But I sure would love a 90% weight reduction Handmade.
---
Is this in survival or adventure?
---
Its a second star on a weapon, you can either have Explosive or 25% Firerate or 50% VatsCrit Damage or 33% Vats Hit Chance or 40% bash damage or 10% dmg while aiming.
---
\&gt;14 screws  
---
What have we done
---
The dream setup is carrying armoured, standard and high capacity. Go up in carry weight as needed but you lose a lot of resistance with every step
---
There is also a Radscorpion Egg Omelette as well ... O.o 
---
You'd think that would be hard to get seeing as the vault was sealed before the nukes went off ^_~
---
As a fellow bar owner I shall certainly stop by.
---
With an orbital strike, can't have competition now ;)
---
adventure - they nerfed payouts in survival and adventure picked way up for awhile because you were still getting caps payout based off level. since the Cap to 50c it seems to have dropped off for me.
---
It’s an effect you can have on a gun, I’ve got a bloodied +25% faster fire rate smg that shreds
---
yes! thank you sir I forgot the name
---
Hehe :P
---
Can we just use deterrence theory? ;)
---
The camp will get stored, some sections may be separate but in theory it should be able to be placed down as is. 
---
But that is in theory only. Actually managing to place it just like that is another tale. Chances are that you need to rebuild, but all your components are stored.
---
 I found a Skeleton Story yesterday that finished the story of Vincent who had the passwords for the Raider cache... I found him between Sunnytop Ski lodge and Top of the World inside a locked tractor trailer, and I'm 1,000+ hours into the game. :)
---
Wait, the Marine Armor Helmet is available in the game? Any idea where I can find the plan?
---
Calmex boosts sneak attack damage
---
the weapon is a shame atm
---
There is a junk pile near Morgantown that may fit the bill. It's not right next to the station, but it's not all that far. 
---
If you follow the rail line south from the station, past the trainyard you will come to a bridge. Just below that next to the road is a junk pile.
---
&gt;Why do you have a dog bowl?
---
Preparing for all the cans of dog food you’ll be eating post Reclamation Day, obviously.
---
Wait you got any duplicate recipes? ;)
---
You need one for one of the possum badges, this will be why.
---
It's also actually quite fun to use, I really enjoyed this challenge.
---
I got mine After server hop Waverly Willard’s Water Park about 6 times. When u spawn in, run straight forward and they will be the tourist directly in front near a car. Can’t miss him.
---
It is possible to get rid of the unwanted item, I followed the instructions on a previous post that worked.
---
Something to do with building walls on the unwanted object and then scraping the items.
---
Not sure exactly, but it worked.
---
That's so cool. I really want to find a spot with the idea of building around existing props now because of how small the budget feels. I can barely decorate after building my camp.
---
Unless you're Bruce Willis.

They should erase duped items, not impose caps on them

You call Scotty to beam you up. Obviously.

Thank you! I just need to know it's stored as a structure, I'll just pray I can put it down as it is.

Ah cool. Thanks man.
---
i actually run a shop with the sole purpose of helping out lower levels its way more satisfying than trading god rolls and i usually sell them for 100 to 500 caps so everyone can afford it whilest not feeling the need to accept donations most of the time i do it for free anyways
---
helping low levels is the "endgame" for a lot of people
---
Todd Howard is the lead scientist in this experiment
---
The upper cap on what you are allowed to carry also stopped me from playing so much, I kept farming junk and moved it over to an alt, then they added a maximum weight and now that alt is useless!
---
Yeah avoided this stupid quest. Seriously fucking around to get a little more space. No Thankyou.
---
You're right, there is no logic behind that statement that you made up.  Thought it was implied that the person getting banned has duplicate items on them - a piece with the same exact rolls and durability, which proves they are involved in some form of duping.  If they recycle two of the same item within the week, flag the player and check their inventory/stash for other duplicates.
---
Guilty conscience?  I wonder why you'd want cheaters to go unpunished.
---
Technically he’s not even alive yet
---
Is the vendor bot still there? I went in on one server and there was a dead Protectron in the corner by the counter he used to stand behind.
---
Found mine at “Forward Station Delta” ( by the Glass Caverns).  It spawns on a table located on the walkway).  
---
There are additional locations (3-5 locations).  But I only found it here (on 3 characters)
---
Me too... Why can't i scrap my thousands of useless ammo (*cough* fusion cells *cough*) that take a ton of weigh in stash :(
---
Went for the armour version I’m mostly a sniper build but the extra damage buff comes in handy when I’m spotted and get mobbed
---
Dead for me too.
---
You're awesome, thank you so much. I'll definitely check it out next time I play. Thank you!
---
Shopping didn't do this, not guaranteeing 3* legendaries on sbq and it constantly crashing did this.
---
I just sold a quad ammo one for script
---
The same exact thing is happening to me man. Did you happen to find a way to fix it?
---
I have a quad and a ghoul slaying version
---
Can confirm my quad explosive 2barrel is way stronger numbers wise than a tse combat shotgun. Not to mention the higher dps, it's almost automatic.
---
This happened to me, a guy just started attacking me when I went up to trad with him, but then he stopped. After about 5 minutes a ghoul came running up to me and as I went to swing at it the guy ran right into my sword and then killed me because I technically attacked him back.
---
I don’t mind the player vending, I’ve never had more than 500 caps ever before. Now I’m up to 1200. Selling magazines and ammo is where it’s at for me.
---
So I've am very clueless apparently lol I just  saw this lol
---
Working a real bar at the moment but will check when I get home. Which do you need?
---
Didn't realize that was change in adventure mode as well.
---
Were you with other people? That didn’t work for me, had to find one when I was alone and kill it, then it triggered
---
I dont care about leveling up at all,,,I just want a game I enjoy playing and I got that in spades.
---
Saving this. My spouse thinks I'm crazy cause I have several spreadsheets printed out similar to these for other quest , it makes tracking and combining things so much easier. When I can photograph a lead deposit, then build a lead resource to check off to parts of separate challenges instead of doing them each individually it's so much easier.
---
Also very likely that these players with good gear are on their 2nd, 3rd... character
---
It's never mentioned ingame so it it very easily missed.
---
Seems alot of players never knew as well!
---
Probably my least favorite of the four. I do like the dynamic of being able to mix pieces from different power armor sets and still have a uniform look in the end. I tossed together Ultracite arms and a torso for the superior dr and added x01 legs and a helmet to patch up the poor rad resistance, then I slapped War Rider on it all. Looks kickass and has good mixed bulk.
---
That said, I hope don't abuse this model very often. My example is just the silver lining on a storm cloud. It's a really cheap and shitty play, and I fully understand why people do not like it.
---
I mean, from a code standpoint it's literally comparing 5 integers: durability, leg1, leg2, leg3, itemId.  If all 5 of those match on an item in a given players inventory that item is almost certainly duped -&gt; flag the player.  If they have a third item that matches all of those integers I'd make the assumption they didn't get all three items legitimately.  With single star items that players are more likely to have multiple, increase the limit to 5 maybe?  It's just about impossible for someone to legitimately have 5 bloodied 10mm pistols ALL with a  durability of 82.  If they scrip two of the same add them to watch list, if they scrip 5 of the same.... I'd say account ban.
---
In 2 out of 3 yes... That's why i can't get my head around what the problem is.
---
What the hell are you going to do with all of that junk? If you're hoarding so many resources that you can't even carry them on an alt, and you keep adding more, then stop! Bulk it and sell it, stop hoarding things you will never use.
---
I think I spammed through the animation after I noticed it was a dupe or didn't care about the card lol
---
Sell it? It's for crafting weapons and armor to get the mods!
---
I think you should take Marine armor because its the best Armor in the game and it looks Awesome.
---
No it seems it was not implied. Anyways, I'm guessing many dupers are clever enough to not have identical items on one character. Most likely they have transfered it to a mule or multiple.
---
I agreed that they should be flagged if they sell multiple items that are identical and then check their inventory. And if possible keep tabs on them for a while to see if they are infact duping items. But insta banning people just like that? No.
---
Curious to how you got the idea that I don't want cheaters to be punished. You obviously didn't read the other posts.
---
The shovel aswell
---
We will just have to wait and see what they come up with I guess. Most likely they already have people looking into this.
---
It's why I still don't have the "kill the sbq" under that one kill tough shit challenge, even after I've attended over a hundred queen fights at this point. Maybe even over two hundo.
---
You gotta landed the killing blow or it doesn't do it
---
well thats some news everyone hoped for at long last we have our all mighty suppressors weight reduction +1 intelligence god roll shovel!
---
get your shit together SBQ your ass gonna get wooped!
---
My wife got a 3-star instigating, explosive, 33% vats railway rifle last night from a sheepsquatch drop. It's good for mole miners but it's nice to know where it's really useful.
---
I've been told only legendary death claws have ability to drop them. I've gotten 2 so far and both came from crates
---
Yeah I don’t have that one either, annoyingly
---
Sorry the duplicate plan and 1* pipe rifle isnt a good tradeoff for all that spent ammo.
---
Correction, its not the best armor in the game. If you buttressed the armor, its in the top 3, but not best
---
True, but then you shouldn't be maxing your inventory space then!
---
That reminds me, I have 700 steel I need to convert into .50 cal ammo later...
---
Probably someone who spent too much time on the fo76 trading subreddits
---
I went to people’s camps who were selling them, bought them and sold them for script
---
It got the best ballistic damage resistance and laser resistance its the second best armor after PA!
---
I really like this
---
Eh, are we talking about the same game? You seem to be naggin about F4, but this is F76
---
great gun for PvE but in PvP people usally dont have their HP at maximum.
---
It's to keep you logging in every day.
---
Can you share some screenshots taken with the lens? I’ve been very curious about what it actually looks like
---
Why am I not suprised?
---
Yes! I've found It too, hovering near Whitesprings, the NCC-76A. Amazing.
---
Thats what I just thougt about you. Then tell me which armor is better.
---
I had a rad stag in my house blocking my hallway. Had to kill it. Then it’s body was stuck so I scrapped my foundation and wall so that I could build it back on top of it.
---
I want a spiral staircase
---
But, why?
---
Cheaper to craft, not cheaper to repair.  
---
Lasers don't have moving parts so they should never have recoil.  
---
Plasma is a bit of a different story, real world attempts at making plasma weapons have interesting results with quite a bit of recoil!  
---
Like I said Plasma Ammo isn't very consistent or reliable in drops, you could run Sons of Dane or even the event that goes there that summons the 3\* Wendigo (which is actually kinda consistent on giving plasma guns and ammo in my experience) but events aren't reliable or always there. In contrast to Fusion Cells where you could spend 5 minutes in Watoga killing bots with a hammer and you'll have enough ammo to break your Laser Rifle in just as much time.
---
Combat, metal, marine, hell, you can make leather better depending on effects
---
Not my Camp, but honestly it depends what you build. They had no turrets for a start - which are probably the most expensive item.
---
2 is just wrong.
---
WTF?
---
Impressive yes. Practial - no. I am currently over 200 my weight limit and my stash is completely full. I don't even know what to do with myself.
---
I meant what is better than marine I know PA is shit but with the right perkcards it can be good too.
---
fast traveling?
---
Ment scout, not marine.  And im not saying marine is bad, but its not the best. Combat Currently is
---
Well its gone from 400 to 600 to 800.
---
At this point I'd rather have a camp budget boost tbh
---
YES! 
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
I kept going place to place trying to find them and couldn’t so someone here suggested to go to one place and server hop the same loc until it spawned. Went to Wally World and got it third time.
---
The waterpark worked for me. She's laying in the parking lot leaned up against a car.
---
I found someone with a CAMP designed to kill players the other day. It was on the cliffs to the west of Whitesprings. They had a super long ladder up to the top where you opened the door and see 3 vending machines, but no floor in front, I fell to my death on those spiky boards on the other side of the cliff
---
It is, it's supposed to be alien tech, the most powerful handgun on the planet, and a simple level 25 .44 revolver is more powerful.
---
You are my true hero!
---
Hey! Sorry for the delay. [Take a look](https://i.imgur.com/WxrjHqq.jpg). Can you verify if that's right? If so I'd be interested in mapping all types of RE.
---
In fact better question - how did you export them?
---
I'd be happy if I could place more of them.  Lots of camp budget left, but apparently I maxed out my lights budget.  While we're at it, I need 2 more vending machines.
---
Also they may have too much stuff, need the stash space and are feeling generous :P
---
ie: me
---
Valuewise it seems like you are getting better end of deal.  As far as in-game functionality, no idea.
---
Scout is bad but Combat and modded marine are nearly on the same strenght.
---
You can get the crook, club, and staff plans from Free Range as well as the mods. Crook has horned, electrified, toothed, glass covered, and spiked mods. Staff and club both have burning, barbed, burning barbed, electrified, poisoned, and heavy mods. RNG to get all of these is so damn low. I farmed the event constantly for about two weeks before getting all the plans. But I have them all now, also on PS4, so if you want any of them I can craft you any of the weapons for cheap. And afaik there are no legendary versions of these available currently
---
Why? Melee?
---
There is a theory...
---
 That Appalachia is the most deadly Wastland Paradise  filled with the wastelands most hostile creatures and and abominations, a deadly paradise that nobody gets to leave nor get to enter its an environment to hostile for even the brotherhood of steel and the enclave to handle it forcing them destroy records of it this is why nobody knows about Appalachia.
---
Pretty sure Combat armor with BOS paint rates better. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmv494/datamined_list_of_all_weapons_and_armor/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
There is the list.  I hope I linked it right.
---
“my server “....? When did we get to choose? I feel so left out.
---
Lol, its like talking to a brick wall... just Google it if you dont trust the info you recieve. Bye
---
[Ohh, you're a jumper! Watch out for Samuel L jackson!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm7B7WzAA1M)
---
Sticks and stones may break my bones,  
---
But insults will never harm me.  
---
But a shotgun to the head sure shuts you up Mr Insult Bot.
---
so as a future trade item its good value
---
Pve melee is 10x better. Death claw with swing speed is like 4-8k a hit...no bullet comes close to that dmg output (ignoring bloody build hangups)
---
I already did but did you Google for the modded marine armor....
---
Who is she? -  Mole Rat Grandma. Or Grandma for short. Granny for shorter. Gran for shortest.
---
Why does she sell only legendary items? - Because Granny loves you.
---
 Where on earth does she farm all this legendary gear? - Granny sees a lot of dead people in her journeys. Plus, do you really REALLY think those machines grind up all the legendaries? Granny may be old, but shes smart!
---
TL;DR - Love Granny.
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---
I choked loud enough at work at "asthma masks" for people to come and check on me.
---
Bravo, my fine human shaped animal.
---
Have a fresh upvote!
---
When I did a transfer there were some meds, boiled water, and I transferred in some grilled Radstag. Honestly didn't know you could do this. Great idea.
---
Well when I get black out drunk I tend to remember bits and pieces too
---
Explosive + 33% vats not possible on same weapon.. But cool story bro.
---
Balance. Lol. They can't XD
---
how do you send a ticket to bethesda?
---
Yes youre right, but I dont like the gameplay style, I should have added this. I have a BSS+1STR Powerfist, it really hits incredibly hard without any other perk than Incissor. But I dont like running at enemies and hitting them. Or my Instigating+40% Power Attack Grognak, it hits so much harder than anything I have, but I want to shoot things. :)
---
Yeah the chest piece got 61 ballistic damage protection and 61 energy protection but the marine armor can get a 84 ballistic damage protection and a 34 energy protection and ballistic is better to have because nearly no enemys use a energy weapon.
---
Plus there is modus he could have communicated with the enclave latter years of the wasteland fill with resource but he didn't this means that modus is trying to build his own enclave to take over the current one in control
---
no ty
---
I think so.
---
Some people will farm legendaries to sell. Some people will farm caps and buy legendaries. Some people like me will do both. Vending hasn't changed the game. If anything it has given me a new way to do what I already was doing. 
---
I agree with you that the queen is not worth it he ammo investment, but that was the case before vending.
---
Yeah it's way out of whack.
---
 I once ate 7 deathclaw steaks and it didn't even fill up my food meter all the way. 
---
It's also not uncommon for me to drop stacks of 50 spoiled foods at a time too.  I don't even try to get fresh food to cook any more, I go for canned and boxed goods now.
---
Bethesda is aware of this issue. It's a new bug in regards to camp placement and being somewhere at the wrong time when something happens. For now, its probably easier to put camps out of the way.
---
...what about reduce the cool down to like 150 scrip/6 hours?
---
When you have too much stuff one day,  you will see a low level person and think: "Ha!  I can drop 50 weight on this guy, and he's gonna love it!"
---
and then you'll still have too much stuff.
---
I did the same thing but at Wally World
---
Yeah, mine has done it twice this morning on XBOX. Gets to about 22 seconds and game crashes.
---
Like a double decker couch???
---
You still need to earn money. Yes, you can go to all these places but what good is it if you don't have Caps or Script? You still need to get legendaries to get Script. You still need to grind for Caps. I see the player vending more as garage sales. It's the junk they don't want or just want to get rid of.  The legendary vendor is just a slot machine so it isn't a sure thing in getting what you want. So it's more Flea Market then shopping mall.
---
That's what I assumed too. There's definitely precedent for other vaults having containment trouble with molerats and of course radroaches.
---
A decrease because they keep nerfing pvp in this game in both modes even when there is absolutely nothing to do in this game for high level players. Survival is not high risk high reward anymore.  What do you do in adventure as a level 238?
---
You see the problem is that legendary drop rates are so low it's almost impossible to get a decent gun. Now the purveyor doesn't only give you a guaranteed 3* it also lets you decide whether you want armor, melee or a gun. It makes farming actual legendary enemies basically pointless. Why spend hours farming west tek when you can just log in very two days and get three 3* weapons from the purveyor?
---
YEA! Then we could all watch TV together and be buddies!
---
*If you get stuck in the perpetual shining you can just relog by alt f4.*
---
Did you really need a PSA for this?
---
That would still be pretty convenient. Even if Samuel L Jackson is chasing me everywhere.
---
My quad fire rate radiums and railway rifles agree!
---
WTF. Upvoted.
---
Is it different than a night vision scope?
---
Make it so the legendaries you get from the vendor can be sold to her within the same purchase session.
---
I save up 1000 scrip because I want the sell back option, I get 10 3 star legendaries and I don’t like any of them. I can sell them back to her for 400 scrip and get another chance at 4 legendaries.
---
Now that is something that duper’s cannot abuse.
---
Who? Do the beach boys actually play this game?
---
I could see why you would think this, but you'd still be wrong.
---
The closest thing that I have personal experience with and that I can think of as closest to the fat man, is the Carl Gustav. It's a similar idea, just a simple tube that launches missiles. There's been several versions, the M2 (1960's version, so probably closest to fallout material/design) weighs in at a hefty 31lbs, unloaded. The M3 at a much more manageable 22lbs, unloaded. The M4 at a svelte 15lbs, unloaded. The M4 version is very recent, 2014, and shows the great lengths that have gone in lightening the weapon. Most likely through material changes.
---
Now. Compare that with the AK, the real world version of the handmade. A Vietnam era AK weighs 8.5lbs, unloaded. Already almost half the weight of the lightest Gustav. The AKM, a more modern version, weighs in at 6.5lbs, unloaded. Far less than half the Gustav. And rifles really aren't "dense" as you say. The receiver is usually a piece of simple thin, formed steel (you can look up AK receiver on google and see it's basically just a piece of thin folded metal with some stampings). I've held an AK receiver blank, it's lighter than a console controller. And there's lots of space inside the rifle for things to move. Springs. Pistons. Bolt/Action. Etc. It's not "dense". It's a bunch of well machined parts fitting together. Even the wood (or furniture as it's called) is rather light. As it's usually some type of composite. You'd be amazed how light a rifle actually is. Especially compared to a giant hunk of formed metal that most rocket/missile launchers are.
---
Looking at pictures, the Gustav is actually much smaller physically than the Fatman. The Fatman appears large and bulky when held by characters. A lot larger than a Gustav does when held by soldiers. The mini nukes appear much wider, hence the need for a channeled approach, rather than an enclosed tube approach. But even then. Despite it's hollow appearance, the Fatman still appears larger than a Gustav, with a lot my physicality and material too it. It's basically a giant metal sled style launcher. So if anything, a Fatman should weigh more than a Gustav.
---
So in reality. The handmade should be lighter. A lot lighter. Not only just compared to it's in game weight, but also especially compared to the Fatman.
---
TL;DR Realistically the Fatman is too light, handmade is too heavy.
---
For pve: Cheap cheap ammo. Seriously. All you need is steel to make ammo. Noore need fir lead ore and acid and gunpowder. So when I am farming legendaries I am also farming ammo. Additionally I can pick my spent ammo off of corpses
---
I got rail enthusiast what was bugged for you?
---
But it's a lot more reliable than farming actually enemies. When i visit west tek sometimes i get no legendaries at all, sometimes i get a few 1* and sometimes a get a 3* or maybe even 2. But even if i am that lucky i mostly get garbage drops like wooden armor and not even 3*. But at the purveyor you can choose not only how many stars it has you can also choose what kind of weapon/armor you get and it also scales with your lvl! It's so, so much better.
---
Brother, I have two questions.
---
1) how do you get in?
---
2) do you make spaceship whooshing sounds when at the helm?
---
Ooh yes, ill be away all of next month training, its gonna be a long month
---
Never heard of em.
---
It blows my mind how some people still expect good game design from a studio that is, demonstrably, incapable of delivering it.
---
I know 7.62 ammo gets bought up frequently as a conversion type.  Switch to that, let it be made in 150 stacks, and I think you’ve got the LMG in a good place.
---
I have a nice one as well (vs super mutants) and love breaking it out, but it has to be special occasions because of the ammo type
---
I remember being low level and wanting to find any kind of ranged legendary that I could wield  ...
---
They are very good with a bloodied build
---
My quad tesla is much more useful than my anti armor tesla which always seems to need to reload just before the enemy is downed. Awkward.  With the quad I can down enemies and reload during breaks in the action on my terms.   I guess that did not change your mind did it?
---
An odd statement considering it would be assumed the same random applies to purveyor vs. events/encounters.
---
"All legendary items are garbage"
---
Compared to what?
---
Totally agree with that last part, it’s definitely only limited by your own imagination. I’ve also decided to roleplay as a shopkeeper during the Fasnacht parade and got sucked into it ever since then. I new run a store that makes at least 5-15k each day just selling things that people want. I’ve learned to focus my daily runs on stocking these items, weather its gathering materials, buying plans to resell, or crafting rare weapons. Ive developed a large friends list of frequent shoppers that come by my store regularly, some even drop me all their duplicate plans for a free gift, or usually just nothing in return. It’s crazy, now when I log in and just stand idle, I’m making money constantly. Hope your business model continues doing well!
---
Fair enough
---
I still have to farm crappy legendaries to feed to the machine though. You could buy them off of people who don't value their items, but over time everyone will catch on and 400 cap 3*s won't exist anymore. Then someone will either pay a bunch of caps to buy legendaries to feed to a machine to get legendaries or they will go back to farming.
---
Insane inflation already happened, unfortunately. Saw someone offering a BE Handmade for *90k* *caps* a few days ago. I think stuff like duping has completely screwed the economy and it would take large-scale changes from Bethesda to have a chance of salvaging it. 
---
In my humble opinion, nothing in the game should be valued over the cap limit and require someone have multiple characters/accounts just to circumvent the cap limit and have enough to do a transaction for a single item.
---
It's a shitty thing. Pacifist mode will prevent a repeat.
---
Right. The balance of the game has been complete nonsense since day 1. So many weapons types are garbage and the perk system is jacked up. You can  make super powerful builds or complete garbage builds. If you build your character a certain way, forget using half the games weapons.
---
idk if im already cashing in shitty legendaries and using the scrip to pay for other shitty legendaries than i would like to also not be limited to a 150 scrip daily. understand what i mean?
---
this is more of a general twitch question you can just google than a r/fo76 question
---
Thank,you for the heads up
---
Do you still have them? And would you happen to be on PC by chance? I cannot bring myself to wander around the ash heap for days.
---
Yeah well and the best place to farm legendaries is whitesprings. Visit the golf club once and you'll be loaded with legendaries. That's kind of lame don't you think?
---
What a dick thing to do.
---
Sure I'm ok with loosening the limit, but I guess my point is if you feel like the legendaries received from purveyor are crap, you'll still be twisted just now it'll be double the 'crap' you receive before you make the statement.
---
I've gotten a few bloodied, explosive, nothing much, but the couple i got with those modifiers sold in vendor at least. Nothing yet to actually use on my char and I'm by no means an excessive player (lvl 161).
---
Haha I’ll take a screwdriver then ;) I’d order a beer but depends what country you’re in :P

Still got a bunch to get, I got a spare oak holler lager currently (someone just got my spare White Russian recipe)

You cannot factor in grounded mutation, because you can add that with ANY set of armor, so it is a wash.

This is the best thread I have seen on here, literally ever. Thanks for that I hope they use some ideas
---
Very little, like all other ammo. I have a bunch in my vend for 2c each and haven’t sold a single one since putting them there. Ammo is so cheap and easy to craft, not to mention you pick up a bunch at random.
---
Those are the ones ive done and aren't bugged
---
I seriously cannot comprehend how a game ends up with this many awful design decisions incorporated into a single game, and still sees release.
---
This piece of shit should have been scrapped and built over again from scratch. The perk system is garbage. Weapon and item weights are garbage. Character scaling is inappropriate for first person play. Servers lag all the time. Shooting feels like shit. Guns do no damage...
---
Its utterly ridiculous, just how bad this game managed to be.
---
Selling well at 75c for 100%’ers
---
You gotta consider that not too many people can contribute 3+hours a day on a game. If daily limit is increased, most players won't be able to hit the limit as there are people out there who are struggling to hit that 140 cap.
---
Why no mic? Xbox comes with one in the box...
---
Oh yes ur right xD have 5 rocketturrets
---
I love pictures, too!! I hate that I have to delete them, honestly.  And now outs full of pictures of angry or dead animals for challenges, so that sucks on loading screens.  I used to have cute fun pictures of players.  It is somehow fitting for a post apocalyptic game.
---
Welcome to Bethesda games. There is no rationality behind Bethesda's choices. Most of the attributes are just randomly added in the game without thinking anything further.
---
Unless they are there, your stuff will probably despawn by the time they get there. Or will be taken by someone else visiting the vending
---
If anyone needs to do this and would like to do it for me, PC here!
---
I’ve personally got the ultracite gatling laser plan twice. You can get it by doing Census Violence. You can also get the Assault Rifle plan from Census Violence as well.
---
Vats builds do more agi more AP...
---
There is hope!  For some reason, it just started working.  In case I did something that helped, here's what I did.
---
1-daylight, 2-killed everything around me in the area first, 3-went left to right in sequence.
---
Actually did it in 30 seconds!  But I don't think that mattered... At that point I just had so much practice...
---
Most of them are probably second or third characters.
---
thank you very much!
---
Daisy cutter and MIRV mod, for when I want to wipe out the entire region for less than 5lbs of investment.
---
Helps that I'm a heavy weapons user, so its weight is even more reduced...
---
right i see that point too, but basically im thinking in numbers. because if i can make scrip faster than i can by from the purveyor more often. and essentially multiplying my chances of getting a worthy leg. quicker. basically im coming from the point of view of a loely lvl 82. im in somewhat of a hurry to get a good gun because in my experience exploves weapons rule.
---
Just replied to another guy how I did it.  I think it is either left to right, or kill everything so you aren't interupted.
---
 I'm guessing there is a subtle glitch in there, but it can work.  Good luck to you!
---
Also if they took cap off, all legendaries in market would raise in price because people would now buy them to scrap them. 1* are as low as 50-100 caps now.
---
Thanks! Stop by anytime!!
---
I use 4 railway rifles. Quad/explosive, AA, Bloodied and Vampires. The quad is my favorite without question.
---
Fusion maybe, but not plasma
---
Probably the most annoying part, but then again the 1 and 2 star trash is what I accumulate during normal play so I'd be off on my numbers regardless.
---
Plasma cores usually sell for about 10c a pop for fully charged ones.
---
Thanks. I’ll try that out and let you know how it goes.  Also, submitted a ticket to Bethesda, so if I get any information from that, I’ll share as well.
---
I don't dupe and I have 6 identical 1 star instigating shotguns... So fuck your shit method lol, you're not as smart as you think you are and they took that into account. RNG happens and someone somewhere is going to have a couple of the same exact things. That's the nature of RNG. What they did was ban people who had unnatural numbers of the same item.
---
Nice. 
---
What system are you on? My new character is an ambulance of sorts (power armor medic) and I was going to do something similar to your hospital. 
---
If you are on PS4 we can team up. If not, I'll ha e the market cornered a little more. Ha!
---
Would recent not have worked in Social? I don’t really have many people to play with so I wouldn’t know haha! Besides I’m on PS4
---
The Crossbow needs one too
---
Ahhh
---
No, I think they’re referring to the Marine Tactical Helmet which is just the gimp mask looking one, not the armored one. 
---
This was my little secret after they nerfed the civil war top hat, but I guess it’s common knowledge now. If you get the plans, you only need 1 glass, 1 plastic, and 3 rubber to craft one. Add on super duper and you’ll get more. They sell for around 30 caps each with hard bargain on. Do one or two grafton runs for rubber and Morgantown or watoga high schools for plastic and you’ve got your 1400 for today and tomorrow easily.
---
1⭐️ wood left arm...
---
Ultralight marine armour weighs much less than ultralight combat armour, in my experience
---
WAAAAAAGHHHH
---
Holy hot damn. Thats pretty cool.
---
How would you have said it in a way that read nicely?
---
Looking at the issue though, does 150 a day allow too many legendaries to be rolled? 
---
If you think that the purveyor and the scrip limit is allowing for too many strong legendaries then fair enough, though if it isn’t then why have the limit that low, particularly if game play is meant to allow for progress?
---
What is happening? I don’t quite understand.
---
Eh, I think it's only obnoxious at the moment because of muled legendaries.
---
Personally the stash limit is back to being a nuisance with vending.  I'm trying to sell my reasonable but not god-tier 3 stars for pretty cheap (1000 or so caps) and things are getting tight to a point where I'm grinding stuff just for weight. 
---
Doesn't help that I keep rolling LMGs for my trade-ins.
---
Il help you out give us 10 mins
---
Cool...
---
There is no hardcore the entire game is casual and not very hard at all the only ppl complaining about the limit are mostly no lifers with way to much time on there hands
---
If this were fallout 4, there would be a mod to let us do it already xD
---
Crashes when using items from your Pip-Boy is quite common. On PC at least.
---
i got you. psn is scottienoeyes
---
Standard message my friend.  "Several of us players" are out because of this....  I think there are hundreds if not thousands of players out if you consider games draw in millions of players so don't think this is a trivial matter to Bethesda. Thank you my friend for your input.
---
Killing blow only
---
Well I know where I'm headed on my explorations today.
---
You are very welcome.
---
Feel like I need clarification. Is the shooting test the Archery test?
---
Oh. I’m on PlayStation. That sounds sucky as hell.
---
More Dakka, more better.
---
Well you Lack Common Sense so what do you know? ;) 
---
Jokes, Thanks I just though it would be really cool and a good way to introduce Robots into our CAMPs :) 
---
Plus the money they would make from people buying the skins for their favourite robot friends. 
---
Plus a Robo Dog/Cat for new players!
---
This has been posted about since the first day of the legendary purveyors. Same as Assaultron heads. Shouldn’t be a surprise at this point.
---
See now don’t you feel a sense or pride and accomplishment
---
That's actually really cute.
---
You're just unlucky. There are some *great* deals to be had out there.
---
I agree. There are a few as others have noted, but there needs to be more. Another that doesn’t spoil is Brain Bombs. Major ingredients are Sugar Bombs (the kind that gives rads), mothman eggs, and brain fungus. Anytime I’ve got a few sugar bombs on me, I FT over to the mothman museum, grab all the eggs, then FT to Whitespring Service entrance and grab all the fungus.
---
I have 364 plans for sale :) everything I have in the game, minus a TSE hunting rifle I got for free trading in camp plans haha. Back in the day you could get a really good gun for the powered gates plan. Thank god they let Grahm still have some rare stuff! Mirror ball seems to be the hottest item right now, 1-4K :) 
---
I was really hoping to see more traps in camps but still haven’t seen one :( and not the spawn trap haha, we all see that one Beth
---
They just need to add the workshop fast travel mats to camps.
---
THANK YOU. I've been looking for the house for months!!
---
Absolutely! Do something...
---
Any ideal for a fast way to get the revive? Jump of a High place?
---
Perhaps Lt. Thomas was one of those people who write 25-page reports.
---
I wish i was as cool as you OP
---
Now make a list of all the objects that you can interact with. I wish the world outside the vault was as interactable as the vault was.
---
I support this 100%. Just think about it. Let's say you're investing 8 hours per day playing the game and getting legendary weapons from enemies yet you have the same limited capability of having the 150 scrip just like the other player who, for example, just played for 1 hour that day and got that amount. He invested less time and effort and got the same result. So I think scrip system should be more rewarding to the players who play more and spend more time in a game farming legendary enemies. Just take any MMO for example - people who were farming dungeons all the time had better gear cause they invested more time in the game and got something better than the others out of it
---
Someone contacted Bethesda support regarding this and posted that they said there could be no restorations of items losing stars and no refunds of scrip, having said that and looking on the positive side at least they are aware of it and with any luck maybe we might get a fix on Tuesday
---
Have you tryed to turn on the stove in the vault?
---
Totally agree CAMP fats travel mats would be so useful. Not quite sure why it's not a thing.
---
Or 3 serums and your done :)
---
That's the mask I wanted the most, never got it, so I'd pay 1-2k just for it lol
---
No! Now I wanna make a new character and try, lmao
---
Too many 'innocents' would suffer if they fully erased dupes.
---
I’d use my tse lmg but the damage is lacking with the high rate of fire it’s kinda useless to me unless they buff damage output
---
I still want it.
---
Okay thanks, I'll put them a bit lower since nobody ever visits me
---
I feel like every scorched-earth event I've been attacked by all three... Sometimes all at once
---
If you have armour with weapon weights reduced by 20% is very beneficial for things like this. I have 2 pieces and to top it off I've also added pocketed mods too
---
Trust me its cool first time i played it took me 10 mins to see what i can do
---
death has consequences..
---
Another player and I were talking the other day and both agreed that we think Bloodied gets the next nerf. Just theory, but maybe something to consider.
---
Just come back tomorrow people.
---
In that case would you be interested in selling it?
---
This is great :)
---
Ace thanks, do I add you as a friend and then invite to group? Never grouped with anyone here before so excuse a silly question
---
Fact #n: Yao Guais validate PA users' existence xD
---
No. I got it from a friend of mine in a clan so no
---
That could work bring it back from Nukaworld. Maybe even add a reciever for the handmade so it can be 7.62 again
---
It's so frustrating fighting a queen for 20 mins, breaking my weapons and armor, wasting my ammo and meds, just to get a stalkers rolling pin and some plan I already know. Or grinding for any legendaries for that matter ugh
---
friend me
---
I think the current limit of 150/day would be fine if they turned it into a weekly limit of 1050 instead. I know that would exceed the scrip limit already, and imo you should be able to hold more than 1000, maybe 1500. That way you don't have problems with your number not being divisible by a couple of legendaries you found, and it doesn't hurt people who grind out a ton in one day and then have other things to do later in the week
---
Just thought I'd ask, lol
---
I have about five I carry and together they are  my ‘main’ weapon.
---
 For most targets I begin with an anti-armor an Executioners (I start with AA +VATS and switch to Executioner when target health drop gets near half) and have a Ghouls version and a Scorched version if that’s what I’m facing. I have all of them primed receivers so I can craft twice as many rounds. Even with the need for a stable flux per 36 rounds the extra damage is worth it.
---
 I still wish they would increase the number of rounds I can craft though.
---
I'm sure others can give more detailed responses but it's supposed to be a rough representation of the toughness of the enemy (above the usual base) and the chance of getting better drops.  You've probably seen the legendary enemies regenerate their health if you don't drop them quickly.
---
The drop isn't guaranteed, but while you may only get a 1 star drop from a 3 star enemy sometimes, you should never get a 3 star drop from a 1 star enemy if that makes sense.
---
Karma
---
The resource extractors shouldn't have a limit anyway, the time of extraction should be the only limiting factor.
---
It would likely get more people actually involved in workshops too.
---
Dame plz make it a mini mr handy "mr handy jr"?
---
Coz normal size handy will get in the way
---
Yeah it makes total sense it is really frustrating getting 1 stars from Imloster Sheepsquatch and Queens though. I feel like those event based 3stars should always drop what they sow
---
Okay sent request
---
Lol no worries you want to sell me that two shot handmade
---
Yes. It’s not night vision at all, it’s just a pale green filter
---
I joined a nuke SQ event that had a bunch of high level players (i.e. it was under control) and took a few seconds here and there to snap pics of all the scorched that showed up.   That took me from 2 to 9 but still looking for that last one.   I know you can take pics of the dead bodies but they do disappear quickly so you can't wait till after the event is done.
---
People will buy them I burn through them like crazy it's just for whatever reason there really easy to make but priced high by default.
---
It is not something that can really be controlled. 
---
You can move your CAMP machine to somewhat control the general area in which people spawn, but the biggest culprit is in the game itself.
---
The game doesn't load in a player structure until you are close enough to see/interact with it. Since you are Fast Travelling, you often and do appear before the game has had a chance to load everything in and you end up trapped in a floor, etc.
---
My CAMP gets visited by a lot of players the entire time I am online. I have spent hours adjusting and moving the CAMP machine around, having people FT in, etc. to test different locations.
---
A mat would be most welcome.
---
I thought about getting the prime reciever, but I'm worried I'll still burn through ammo just as fast and have added an extra thing to farm making it even more of a pain.
---
Sorry... not for sale :-)
---
But thanks again for the help
---
I'm perpetually carrying around armor that reduces the weight of all my weapons by 60%. I also happen to be using bear arms. My quad automatic handmade? 7 pounds. My instigating MIRV? .64 pounds
---
But you need flux for that and it involves going into a nuke zone. Potential nuke launch and all that. I just like picking up dodgeballs and spoons
---
You really don't want that gun. "Two shot" on a shotgun is pretty worthless because it only adds one pellet, not an extra round. Anti-armor/instigating/furious/quad (except on pump action) is the way you want to go. Also be careful with "explosive" at close range. Without the right perk (fireproof) or armor (dense) you can end up doing just as much damage to yourself. Something to think about before you go blowing caps.
---
Crap how I do it? Sorry my chat is weird
---
Anyone else getting flashbacks to Oblivion and the pencil stairs glitch?
---
I haven’t been in a nuke zone for over 3 months (no joke) but friends just give me them or I grab them from the reddit market for around 40-50 Caps each  :)
---
Cool, how do it do it sorry?
---
Attaching a longer barrel to reduce the weight for almost all guns is top tier tho
---
If you're still on and on pc, I'd try it now
---
I already traded now, but I’m a bloodied build and I’m already of the same view that there might be a nurf. Wouldn’t just devalue this one but 1/2 my weapons. Bethesda will be Bethesda
---
But it completes like a misc. quest if you press the interact button on the purveyor (E on PC, X on PS4, A on XB1).
---
Is it a gauss rifle or a tesla rifle
---
I had to modify mine after someone messaged me saying they had spawned in the locked area and couldn't get out. I ended up making it so that the ground floor was unlocked and available to everyone, then lock the upstairs so me and my buddies can drop ammo and gear safely without worrying about a random swiping the loot.
---
They keep it low so you have to come back everyday, look at atoms shop and then scrap it.
---
Id give you silver if I could
---
Yeah that’s one way to do it for sure
---
I hear ya and don't disagree but we have to get to a point where the.1% of dupers don't control the game for the rest of us. They did their damage, if they get hordes of weapons from the vendor there is no difference from the hordes of tse they have today. I really want to see us move on. I mean what does it do it they have stockpiles really? They can sell stuff for trade, caps, or cash on eBay? It doesn't affect the game that much as long as the exploits are closed and they can't crash the servers I think. But I do hear what you are saying and do agree with the frustration.
---
Waaaaaagh
---
Just thought I’d ask glad to help
---
The shoopdawoop
---
I'd say, yeah. That's a decent trade.
---
You'll definitely be able to trade the minigun later if you don't like it. Bloody explosive is really popular.
---
The third effect on the LMG is better than the third effect on the minigun, but we all know that the LMG comes with the curse of having to feed it. The minigun doesn't have that curse, ammo is much easier to gather/craft.
---
Two Shot is really underwhelming these days. I'd probably just vendor it for the scrip.
---
I need it too, if you give me about 15m ill be on bud!
---
Can quad roll on a Gatling laser/plasma?
---
I'm curious about how it interacts with their ammo mechanic.
---
I upvote every thread about Fast Travel mats for visibility. 
---
They never should have been removed from the B.E.T.A. They are integral to C.A.M.P./Workshop building and once Bethesda discovered whatever bug Fast Travel mats had in the B.E.T.A they should have made it a priority fix.
---
I have nothing to down myself I'll try to find grenades or something my gt is A Used Stimpak
---
Seems that the rule of thumb is they'll show  picture of all the armors if it has different styles, but if it just shows the one type then it will turn all armor into that one, cosmetically.
---
No no no Bethesda should add in the alien rifle
---
I have some grenades, we just need a high ledge to fall from
---
Where do you farm your legendaries? I’m just coming back to the game after a long break and when I cleared west tek, I got nothing. I got some off SQB, but I can’t always rely on that popping up.
---
Alright yeah just message me on Xbox when you're ready
---
There have been a couple of posts with testing that put it around 35%
---
Waaaaaaagh!
---
occasionally in a White Springs nuke zone, a pair of level 90 Yao Guai can spawn in the garden/forest area between the rear lobby entrance and golf club. two people in hazmat suits with speed demon can aggro them and drag them into a pincer attack on the 3-8 people congregating outside the entrance of the golf club and watch them demolish the unsuspecting players.
---
players sell to other players cheap to help each other learn muauions. otherwise we can just sell them to train station vendors for 500 and other players will have to buy them from the train station for thousands of caps. please dont abuse their generosity. thank you
---
The only CAMP in the game that is allowed to float, based on the approval from FO76 community.  
---
/r/fo76 *^(certified.)*
---
Maybe. People have been saying that for a long time. I'm not so sure. Bloody guns are not really that unbalanced. Not like bloody melee, not like TSE's. 
---
I've said before that if they wanted to nerf bloodied melee they'll do it by nerfing unyeilding armor.
---
Well no...but you probably wouldn’t want it anyways! Just 800 pounds of junk
---
Go practice!
---
Same reason you cannot sell/drop/trade anything with atom shop paints or outfits from there. If you could just sell/trade the objects then there would be no point in paying for them. Plus you could buy kits and immediately sell them for caps making it so you could just buy your way through the game with real money.
---
Sweet! Fugetabout three star ranged. I want a bloodied shovel!
---
Yeah crashing while using Aid items in the Pipboy is still a thing. It’s the weirdest thing because it only happens from the Pipboy. 
---
The majority of the time I use Dogfood that I have favorited from the favorited menu. When I do randomly cook up some food and try to consume it from the Pipboy that’s when I experience the random chance of a hard crash.
---
 Perhaps the checks that game does for spoiling food bug out when consumed under certain circumstances?
---
I think I'm in love
---
Maybe they could... Idk fix there fucking game maybe?
---
I have had crashes from learning plans. So spoiling was no part of it.
---
That does seem like a better approach to balancing it.
---
 I have never played Bloodied, but this guy was telling me how he can get some pretty insane numbers on some of the Bloodied Heavy Guns. That can drive the DPS up pretty high. 
---
Just throwing ideas around trying to prep for what feels like the inevitable.
---
Mine guess buzzzzz womp. Tse Tesla checking in
---
I spawned inside another players locked area in their camp, so I had to fast travel again to get out without becoming wanted. Luckily it was right next to a train station, but still come on, this is ridiculous.
---
Improved repair kits aren't from the atomic shop
---
I understand that, but the improved kits are not even atom store items - i assume i've got these from quest rewards at some point.
---
It would be like blocking the BoS or Nuka PA paints from sale because other PA paints are available in the Atom Store.
---
2 shot, Quad, Incendiary  light machine gun 🤤
---
Beach boys ain’t shit, always gonna be doo doo wit them stupid stealth boys and cav armor😂
---
Start one yourself
---
Exactly, agree... if they want to do microtransactions it’s a no brainer for loads more “outfits” they’ll have the stuff from Fallout 4 for a start... but no, repair kits... *sigh*
---
You on now?
---
If you’re duping legacy weapons &amp; high tier weapons to cash at the exchange you have large issues in life haha.. also to my knowledge it’s been fixed.. so no worries on that, plus even if people are duping for scrips guess who’s fault it is that duping is in the game. I can’t think of any multiplayer rpg type game that had this issue just saying😂
---
Ok im on, my "find someone" is acting up, can you join me? Gt OmnipotentZeus0
---
Rifles with modifications on them IRL weigh at least 10-12 lbs.
---
2 shot, Quad, Incendiary crossbow now that is next lvl wish i lt could be real
---
Damn I love your thinking on the outfit
---
Alright I'll invite you it says your offline
---
his name should have been Charlie then... not Willy
---
is this like a personal attack or something
---
Well, maybe you should have elaborated on that in your post, because I'm sure many would agree that those things are broken and we all have first-hand experience with some of those issues - especially the wall snapping.
---
Yeah it was recently data mined or something
---
Good luck but I hope you take a moment to rethink priority here. Fo76 or real life? Come on man 😎 
---
Good luck and check back in when you return, we will be here
---
2 shot, Quad, Incendiary double barrel ? Some legendarys will never be found 😔
---
I find the lack of love for the zetan's in this game disturbing.
---
I'm going to say the opposite as I participated in 3 successive and successful SBQ fights yesterday alone; nukes are being launched CAVEAT IS THE AIMING when the nuke is launched. If it's not leaving Drop site V9 clear from rads I can tell you that my mostly dead Bloodied Unyielding lvl 230 ass is not coming. :)
---
I love my .308 lmg, I would use it all the time if not for the ammo crafting issue you point out and the relatively small magazine (I use 250 drum, not sure it there's a bigger one).
---
For the same reason a Daedric Claymore on TES games would weigh like 60 pounds, balance. In all fairness the actual dps of a Fatman is trash compared to a good handmade.
---
Weird, I am on PC and have never seen this issue.   Every once in a while I do get the crash on picking a lock though.
---
2 shot, Quad, Incendiary cryolator? Just imagine it
---
Well actually it’s seems there might be multiple queens or that when one dies a female takes the mantle, it’s likely that Appalachia was bombed to hell till nothing lived there anymore given the nukes are fabricated within their silos so they don’t ever have to stop firing
---
Thanks XD
---
I would have loved to wear the tactical ops underarmour  as an outfit, if it was available as an outfit I would have bought it
---
You initiated pvp. Anything that happens afterwards is your fault.
---
Nah, we all give stuff away. Just don't forget about those kinds of gifts when you get to be high level.
---
I wouldn’t mind fighting them if I couldn’t be hit while I was jumping away with marsupial but it seems that there is a huge delay every time I do that, as I still get from like 10 feet up in the air
---
The LMG is an amazing weapon but I agree, the ammo crafting is nowhere near as efficient as it should be. If it wasn't for the ammo usage I'd use it over my double shot handmade any time.
---
This. Either there is not enough content or it takes too long to complete.  ‘It’s ridiculous that I have to take pictures to get an essential item’ or ‘waiting in line is the only endgame now’
---
Watoga will get HS2 before we do 😂
---
So what would you do if you're participating in an event with someone using a melee build, and you yourself have a heavy weapon build?
---
Some folks afk while doing other stuff so their vendors can run.  Put on Happy Camper and profit?
---
Fact 3 run
---
When you get to a high level in Fallout 76, Raider Power Armor is useless. Giving it to a low level player will at least get it some use instead of scrapping it.
---
[Can you guys say Colorado?](https://youtu.be/xO4LaAHJqxw)
---
Fuck Yao Guais. I killed 4 of them yesterday, including an albino (I'm level 44). Luckily, they can't fit through doors, so that which did not kill me, made me stronger.
---
The whole point of Bethesda being able to offer the improved kits was the condition that they could not be sold, traded, or dropped. No Pay to Win. If you don't need them, just destroy them. You can't sell or trade items modded by Atom store skins either.
---
I love this idea, ESPECIALLY the Cargobot. That one is really creative; I actually really like the idea of being able to summon your STASH or a needed bench to you anywhere, anytime.
---
I'd have pacifist mode on.
---
Shopping is the new endgame 😉.
---
I like this idea.
---
I mean, it's for kids so...
---
You're a super spy.
---
i just added you and will be sure to stop by
---
I thought you get a standard lens attachment from getting possum badges.. never knew about night vision.
---
Was it legendary?
---
I think that Bethesda would love to allow us to sell or trade anything at anytime, if that's all it was... unfortunately, human nature being what it is, exploits are sought and duping commences and things are made worse for all of us..there's no way around it.
---
Legendary level 1 opossum. Cant remember what dropped though.
---
Just a thought, but why not both options?
---
Just accepted once I saw this msg. ;)
---
I wouldn't even mind the low damage that much if it wasn't broken. Most of the time it will shoot a second delayed shot that misses most of the time. If it worked well, it would still be somewhat possible to use it with the converted fusion mag. But with the rare alien blaster ammo, it needs to do at least 5x its current damage to be anywhere close to useful
---
Yeah, mostly I drop stuff for people that I don't need or take up too much space, as people have done for me whilst I was a lower level. There's no need to be cautious, I've literally never met a single hostile player before after many, many hours of playing.
---
I would honestly toss in a Mr. Farmhand (fixed) that would harvest crops or go scouting to acquire the desired crops such as cranberries or something.
---
Christ people will jump through so many hoops just to defend any flaws in this game lol. You have no idea how “thick dense” the virtual item is you haven’t held it, it’s arbitrary and OP is right.
---
Yea sounds great
---
That’s Chads special stash... they got no Internet, remember?  😉
---
I hope it’s because Bethesda wants to add more Zetan’s and a Zetan focused DLC. 
---
How cool would it be to have a DLC focused around the Flatwood’s monster in a similar vain to Lying Lowe focusing on the Sheepsquatch.
---
Fun Fact: Yogi Bear was named after Yao Guai.
---
All I can think of is start a new character and run there to see if it's that one character or your game. Should ask support over on the bethesda website.
---
Thanks! I've been lost in the wastelands wondering where these are.
---
Yeah I know lol his name was Willy though and he was even dressed like Willy, top hat and all
---
it hasn't been that hard to farm or buy fluorescent flux and one flux lets you double the number of rounds per materials cost/instance of crafting. 
---
And it increases the damage at least on scorched type enemies and scorch beasts. So far it has been worth it to me and you can always change the receiver back if you need to
---
**BETHESDA ARE INNOCENT**
---
The strat guide indicated a bunch of alien mobs that could be fought. Id assume the Nuclear Winter DLC should cover it... I hope.
---
Yeah, when you've been playing for that long you've just had more access to the loot generator.
---
I could make a new character and use explosive guns and three star melee weapons the whole way through.
---
Time, luck and most importantly... we've lived through the ups and downs in the market. Bought stuff when prices were low.
---
I just use mine up to get rid of the weight.
---
Maximum potential. Only 3* legendaries can drop a 3* item, but that doesn't mean they are guaranteed to. A legendary without any stars will not recover its health, and is not any stronger than a non-legendary enemy. Higher star legendaries do get a health/armor buff, and some of them (like mirelurk kings or bloodbugs) even have a (stronger) poison/bleed effect they inflict on you
---
Yeah, only give it to players directly, there’s no way to ensure they actually get those gifts if you just drop it at their camp. Or put it in your vending machines for free
---
stop dictating how others should play, fucktard
---
Long time Cannibal here, looking to join. 
---
How donI do that?
---
OMG! there is SO much potential isn't there?!
---
I just ask that for one day they remove the fast travel cost for camps so we can really zip around..
---
on a side note, once we can place things around our camp, I'm wondering if we'd be able to fill a bowl with gumdrops and bubble gum at least (and a reminder kids, only take ONE!)
---
Woof
---
*groan*
---
I just bought it after the rest because i already know it will be needed for challenges.
---
There was a fairly popular mod for Fallout 4 that did exactly this. It simply allowed for the user to choose what layers of clothing/armor/under armor showed up on top of everything. 
---
Not hard to implement from a design perspective, no clue as to how hard that would be to implement in 76 from a coding perspective.
---
stop selling trash yourself
---
Yes that is definitely a must!
---
Wouldn't that be nice?
---
Team tactics.
---
If you are hostile towards another player, such as shooting a wanted guy, you are hostile to all members of his team.
---
It's a common baiting technique.
---
Stalk your victims. Watch where they go. Who they are running around with. What weapons are they using. A little recon will go a long way.
---
Not all junk can be bulked. Some like scrap gold can be sold unbulked.
---
It's 830 and I've just read the stupidest thing I will read today.
---
As a bloodied heavy Gunner I would look for bolstering over unyeilding armor (sentinel preferably) for that tank like effect...maybe co centrated fire or grenedier over glow sighted (equip that for nuke zone or uranium fever event)
---
Most players just give stuff away if they're not using it, I have given alot of low level stuff away. I've never had a bad experience with it, not sure how you would. Throw up a heart and FT away if it's still sketchy
---
That one might actually be bugged. I tried 6 times already with a lmg. I can't statistically believe there is always someone that can get the last hit,while i'm using the fastest fire rate gun in the game.
---
I stalked a low player killing a Yao guai, kept stimming him when he fell. Never helped, other than to cripple the legs.
---
PC.
---
It's a rando looter shooter grindathon. You grind for gear or you grind for caps to buy gear.
---
You can't get around it. Sorry.
---
Double barrel shotguns are the highest damadge shotguns in game. So yeah it's always gonna do more than any shotgun.
---
Yep!

Stimpacks ammo

I had a mod for fallout 4 like that and it was just brilliant, the freedom to better craft our individual character looks would  be a massive improvement. 
---
Bethesda has implemented many things from these threads, here’s hoping this becomes one of them.
---
I refuse to use PA so I end up collecting full sets and dumping them on random players
---
Did you complete the quest and get a recall card? If so go to the shack and use the terminal. People will join you. Otherwise you have to craft one or stay on a server where you see people gathered at the quest locations and join them after they trigger it.
---
Because the handmade probably does more damage.
---
Really? To think I dismissed my strategy guide because it had all sorts of incorrect information. Here it is giving us glimpses of stuff that hasn’t released yet. 
---
I can see it now. After Nuclear Winter sets in the Zetans have the cloak of darkness they’d want to run around with unfettered access to all of planet Earth.
---
This is off topic, but hopefully Nuclear Winter gives us the Winterized T-51b paintjob they show in the strategy guide. In the game files it gives extra energy resistance just like in Fallout 4.
---
Combat Armor's premise is that it offers even protection with DR/ER.  However, it ignores rad resist entirely.  Marine Armor pulls away from DR/ER, but gives you RR in return.  So, it's the *most* balanced option - perhaps balanced to a fault if you don't care about RR.  RR starts to matter if you're melee and want to use Bloodied to the fullest extent against the Scorchbeast Queen, because her constant rads are a big problem for non-PA users.  However, most players will just don the PA and call it a day.
---
There is a hidden benefit to Marine Armor though - the Marine Dense Mod is vastly more common than any of the other Dense mods.
---
You get no xp for shopping.

Stable flux

That’s pretty cool!
---
Very interesting......
---
S’mores, many many s’mores.
---
Plans, clothes
---
Yeah
---
the entire gameplay is basically just focused around grinding loot to sell to other players now, It’s essentially a business owner simulator.
---
Initially I liked the update, but have realised it has now taken centre stage as the main thing to do. And quite frankly it’s boring now and doesn’t make up for the fundamental issues with the game.
---
It was a step in the somewhat right direction, but still shallow at its core.
---
Or increase it up to 200.
---
Nooooo oooo!

Attention Bethesda Games Studios:  Hire this person.  Or at least let them work freelance per idea or something, lol.  
---
Upvoted.
---
👍👍👍👍
---
Dude once left me ultracite, I only took the core since I already had a suit of ultracite
---
Even if you don't have decent guns or armor I would put some in your vending machine because people looking for it will come and maybe buy something else
---
Nah, anywhere you want.
---
I like nuking non traditional locations. Dry lake bed. Grafton steel. Monogah. Charleston is fun. Nuka cola plant.
---
Hell, nuking Morgantown is pretty awesome. I've dropped a few onto the ash heap and cleared mines.
---
Seriously, anywhere you want.
---
It's always fun to see the unconventional weapons reveal their hidden utility in situations like that.

---
I had fun when I played in 2012 and when I played it again in 2016. and if the person has yet to play it, they should. Witcher 3 blows it out of the water but both are VERY good games to play
---
Calm down, dude.
---
Just did it. Thanks. Should be by in a few.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Start a new character! I've done it twice, with different builds and "starting" in different regions
---
stims and canned meat stew are my most two popular sellers
---
Easiest way is through facebook. EATT - Establishment of Appalachian Taste Testers.
---
I mean I dont know... I am just hoping the stuff they had for Zetans wasn't for nothing.
---
Id love for an invasion force style event to go down. Some "Independence Day" level event.
---
They really need better controls for this. Half the time I get dropped in the pond myself next to my camp. At least the spawn protection seems to work against rads from the water long enough to get out. 
---
Had one guy make a camp over mt storm reservoir and I spawned stuck on the  bottom of the lake. Almost drowned stuck in my power Armor
---
Icy what you did there.
---
yeah but how? I've watched videos and tried a lot of things, never been able to make stuff float.
---
I’ve always felt like it was a apocalyptic simulator to see how people would react in real life. Some people would leave supplies to help the less fortunate week people and some would build turret camps outside of white springs. Moral choices we know who to kill !
---
As far as I know, that helmet isn't even available in the game. It was found in the dev room some time ago.
---
Oh, is that actually a thing?  I noticed some Gulpers doing a crazy breakdance/contortionist routine yesterday too.
---
At the least I am sure they can see the potential monetary gain the in allowing us more flexibility in how we layer Armor and clothing.
---
I would consider that all black Tactical ops under armor in the Atom Shop if I could choose to wear it over all my armor. (Also if it wasn’t a casual under armor. Of which getting the Shielded lining is currently bugged and you can’t get lining higher than resistant.)
---
I absolutely love this idea! It may be one of the best ideas I’ve ever heard in fact and regardless of what Bethesda does this is definitely going to be a thing now.
---
Can you cross post this thread to filthy casuals please? It would definitely get a great reception there, we might be able to get it to gain some momentum!
---
Need that 300 cap the 150 is keeping my vending machine low.
---
I find the same thing . I have too many legendaries just through basic game play even without a queen fight. so I end up sitting on a backpack full of gear I want to scrap but end up having to wait to scrap it and become overencumbered because my stash is already full too.
---
most of the game is sort of a balance between currencies you can't have too much of, stash weights you're constantly micromanaging so you can actually fast travel still and world hopping to find obscure things that everyone else wants that never seem to spawn. that's what pushed me to take a break before.  not sure what to suggest either.  I love the game. I enjoy playing it a lot. but I always end up with way too much stuff I have to just micromanage that *that* becomes the game.  and no, I don't pick up all the junk I see anymore. I guess I just slowly scrip my weapons for stash space but there is that scrip limit....
---
I did a stint in the Corps back in the early 90s. Was in the lower brass line. Keep hydrated and stretching is key to help prevent injuries. You won’t find more people dedicated to music than those in DCI. Best of luck to you.
---
As a huge Halloween fan and being sad we didn't get decorations last year, I hope they add a bunch this year. Give me those Vault Boy pumpkins darn it!
---
“A player I encountered” would have worked.  Either way it doesn’t matter, we knew what you meant, the camp is awesome and the pictures are nice.  *thumbs up!*
---
Realism have you heard of it? Lol
---
In most hives in nature, if the queen dies, all reproduction is halted and the hive slowly goes extinct. I doubt its any different with the scorchbeasts.
---
Energy weapons with the "bullets explode for area damage" effect were removed from the drop tables.
---
Any that dropped before that are called legacy weapons.
---
you can move the camera clear into the air?
---
I do really well on serums
---
Not meant to slam you. Making a play on the fact that we don't get to choose servers.
---
oh... well that maybe explains it lol
---
A drill
---
Plans, keep all plans even if you know them, and sell the ones you don’t need
---
Yep, this crash its too common on PC
---
No, for 76. It’s called “better inventory”. It’s only active to the player inventory (not stash), but it gives weight by category, allows you to sort by sub category (like aid gets broken down into food, drink, healing, etc), and also give stack weights for individual items.
---
I got mugged by a Mr. Handy yesterday.
---
Worry not and keep killing.
---
I normally grind west tec, burrows and golf course.
---
I’ve had that, if it was fallout 4 we’d be able to pop it all in a bath tub and have it look like we’d disolved a body in there, this is the kind of camp decoration I need lol 😂
---
Mine just kinda did the magicarp...
---
As you spawn at a vendors camp HOP like mad. Youre lucky if their foundation is concrete and you get pushed out like a turd but if its the other wood foundation then man youre stuck between them.
---
Regular armor kind of has nothing going for itself other than the ability to have legendary traits right now. The whole character and equipment system is a mess because it's built for the single player games where going from scavenged items to pre-war relics is a form of progression, but in a multiplayer title it simply isn't all that interesting if everyone just uses the same few best items. Variety adds a lot more to the experience when you're in there with others.
---
I think passing this along u/LadyDevann would open to great content in the future!
---
They do not allow cross posting, but i did copy/paste this exact post over there. I hope youre right. :)
---
I'd say some of the more common sellers I have are:
---
* Treasure maps.
---
* Plans that would be uncommon to most players.
---
* The BoS version of the Combat Armor Helmet.
---
* Stable Flux (not Yellowcake, though).
---
* Two-Shot anything.
---
* Uncommon outfits.
---
* Bobbleheads.
---
* Marsupial Serum, at least in the beginning, less so now.
---
Things that don't move at my store:
---
* Ammo, even at 1 Cap, no one buys it.
---
* Stimpacks (fine by me, they weigh too much anyway).
---
How do you feel about them now, since last “balance” (nerf)
---
I have one that somehow stuck from that quest. Even after multiple completions of the quest, it’s still there.
---
My ammo was 1 cap a round we need to be able to bulk it no one buys it....
---
Mr fuzzy tokens, fairly priced ballistic fibre, ionised steaks, high radiation fluids, I’d buy all those things
---
Have had a lot of crashes when inspecting a weapon or armor in the pip boy. Everything just freezes up.
---
But, if you wanna concert straight junk to money, don’t scrap it. You can sell whole junk picked up in the world: phones, extinguishers, etc.
---
Great use of those lights! Awesome!
---
Serums sell them for 250c the sell well.. I may even drip mine to 200c
---
Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
---
astonishing
---
Extremely cheap meds/chems. Serums priced below 500. Canned dog food/canned coffee. Relevant plans priced decently. Legendary weapons with explosive/two-shot/bloodied/whatever else is popular, legendary armor with unyielding/weight reduction/etc.
---
I have a vamp explosive w/ auto rcvr that's pretty nice but the recoil is a bear and the steam cloud from firing may obstruct your view...but ammo is fairly easy to craft and RECOVERABLE!
---
Need weapon reducing perks on power armor pieces
---
I saw a YouTube gal showing how bad the debuffs effected her play style and build. She went back to the regular one.
---
If they really need it they will I just dropped 4k on .45 ammo the other day
---
I have summited a ticket about this and they are trying to get me to troubleshoot their software.  And they want to blame the issues on other programs on my PC.  They also told me to open incoming port 80... Wait what?  Most residential ISP plans don't even allow incoming port 80.  So obviously someone does not know what they are doing.
---
I'll be crafting up sweet rolls for it
---
Are you going to drop the nuke right by dropsite v9 because I don’t have power armor?
---
Really frustrating
---
possum badges, 25% chance, got 2 today
---
Yeah with all the perks it’s literally garbage now.. only thing decent on them is enforcer if you have that maxed. Then you can use them to cripple an enemy and use another weapon to actually kill it.
---
do the rare mobs not respawn?
---
i built a sign in my camp telling everyone i need to revive someone. waited for like 5 min for someone to show up and i got my badge.
---
Great work...gold tribble awarded
---
It would
---
Really suck if they changed ammo types for people like me that have been stockpiling or have a large stockpile of 308....
---
True but .45 weighs 0 on my guy and is way heavier in the stash. My constantly overweight ways are killing  my sales
---
I've done that three times, I play since beta. All the people I used to play with have left the game because there is nothing to do and they keep nerfing survival.
---
I could do it'd for you, if you want.
---
Just make sure you have the materials for it. 
---
Dm me you gt and I'll add you.
---
Can you upvote this so it has visibility?
---
If you get monster mash to activate, it's a pretty good xp payout.
---
They remain in their prone, sleeping pose but skitter around on the ground like roaches. It looks odd but also messes with hit detection so it is kind of a disaster.
---
I love the game overall but stuff like this pisses me off. Who do they think enjoys literally having to scrounge for hours just to get a common resource to Bulk up the otherwise unsellable junk? Who heard that there was an "exploit" to let you get a lot of plastic if you go to a particular place and it hasn't been stripped already and thought "Oh no can't have players gathering this resource easily" I'd understand if it was used heavily for end game gear but it's not it just makes it tedious for no reason. And I can even deal with that if I think "Oh well they just didn't think about it when making the game hopefully they'll improve it at some point" but the problem is it was working alright it was just a little boring and they said let's actually take that away. Plus it breaks the immersion because they're not made of freaking cloth.
---
they could have done a great many things with the X-bow and did not pretty sad to say the least Beth, I had an awesome \*\*\* and I sold it after killing 76 scorched with it.
---
I would start it ASAP then nibble away at the challenges as I leveled up to 50 so I can craft a max lvl backpack as soon as I unlock it..
---
I never have problems with them but that's cause I stagger them and break their limbs with Enforcer and my trusty shotgun that I have nicknamed Deadly Daycare...cause when a hoard of glowing ones are all crippled around me, that's what it looks like.
---
will ^^
---
thats what Ill do on my next build i should have said
---
If you’re actively using the player vending machines in your camp, you can make a lot of caps selling off duplicate plans you find. There are tons of weapon mods from Free Range that I always sell easily. The mounted insects sell really well too. I don’t grind the biv quests but I image those sell too.
---
I haven't messed with The Burrows. Worth time time, then?
---
Sent request
---
Omg I was wondering if anyone else had seen this!
---
At least once a day when I’m killing super mutants, at least one of them just stands with their hands up! I was like wtf?
---
I miss being able to spam this. It was crazy fun and a great XP grind!
---
Ok quality is going to be trash
---
This is a survival based game tho it's to be expected everyone is on they're own no one likes it when you lose all stuff that you worked so hard to collect. I understand it's frustrating but try not to bring stuff with you that you'll miss...
---
Exactly, meaning all challenges should be account unlocks and not only backpacks.
---
its all vr none of this is real...
---
that is a cool pic you took
---
What mats do you need per letter? And how much budget do they tend to take?
---
I've seen this elsewhere. Just a random loading error. It'll be normal if you server hop.
---
It could still be the story?
---
Very pretty
---
Rocket powered super hammer.
---
I go up to players and drop whatever I'm not using atm. Have given away full power armor sets some really good legendaries and what ever ammo I won't be using for a while. Yea there's been times I've dropped something for a random only to regret it later but eh I keep moving and farming and giving away stuff.
---
When I saw the skeletal war comment on that terminal I burst out laughing.
---
If there is no queen fight Distant Thunder can sometimes spawn scorched creatures. It's not a guarantee though
---
Interesting. Oddly enough, I'd quite like more immovable objects. I'm tired of going to a potentially interesting location and finding that everything has been stripped by another player. Maybe they could've made it so that instead of removing the items, clicking on them gave you one (only one per 24 hours, as with the boxed loot) but it's still there for the next player. I'm probably being silly, but all those empty rooms get tiresome.
---
i will gladly take it off your hands for my decoration purposes
---
I've heard the new patch is going to have a patch for 'concrete foundation fast travel' fuckeroonies..let's hope so
---
All my non used ammo is always set to 0
---
i did the atom quest yesterday kill 76 scorch with a bladed weapon and I kept trying to reload it after every kill. i'll stick to my guns...
---
So damn cool.
---
Hahaha "tax returns" we'll geta couple thousand caps back
---
So how do you get up there?
---
Pretty cool, huh?
---
Any drops you want from the Queen you can probably buy from a player for way less time and wasted ammo
---
They really have a chance of a badge? I thought the only way to get it is either the challenge or the Campfire tales event, but its not a daily quest, you can complete it as many times a day as you can find it.
---
yeh i know that...just that someone told me that the quad assaultron was legacy..i was sure it wasnt..just wanted more opinions
---
It does more damage on the stat screen and does an additional bonus to scorched enemies on top of that. The bonus isn’t shown in the damage value though
---
👍
---
Can people actually buy items priced at zero? The few times I've seen them listed, when I try to buy, an error pops up, "Trade failed on server" or something like that.
---
I was finally able to complete it last night by hanging around in Flatwoods and bugging people over the mic, haha. Thanks though, I appreciate your offer!
---
:) seems that way
---
Unfortunately, his squad got wiped out by the mole-miners.  Final report was not submitted.
---
Meanwhile i carry literally 12 heavy weapons at all times with my heavy gunner. It's the funniest build ever &lt;3
---
The alien blaster has gotten weaker and weaker since fallout 3. It was an absolute god gun in that game. Still strong in New Vegas. And meh in fallout 4, though the hub’s version was okay thanks to the better criticals.
---
I really hope we get a way to upgrade it eventually or it gets the buff it deserves
---
Most definitely, you get about 200+ xp per kill and a decent amount of legendary.
---
I have a 3* power fist with a bonus to power attacks, attacks on beasts and limb damage that does great against yao guai
---
It definitely leaves my stash dunno about the recurving end. All my recipies are at 0 too. Basically everything I used to dump at the station I now put in my stash for 0.
---
It looks dumb in my opinion, it makes me laugh every time.
---
I have 4 characters (129 / 89 / 87 / 55 ) it would take me around 2-4 weeks of grinding to unlock all of them with standard backpack + high capacity alone - and then that is also finding cameras as well and then redoing the same quests over and over and over. 
---
And that is not on top of any new utility items they add that might make or if I decide to restart a character. Simply put the current system would work fine in a single player game but it really adds nothing to a mmo style game.
---
And Lets face it a lot of the people who play this game have jobs / family's / life's they also do so its not like we can just spend 40 hours in a week to grind through all these things
---
It has to stay close to your player. I was up on the ship and just turned on hide player
---
“The helmet is all around (...)” what do you mean? It’s not.
---
I'll be giving that a try post haste
---
They're on the shelf behind the Mole-Man that trades in Legendaries.   So that's proof enough for me.
---
It would be interesting to see your take on the vault dwellers (players) who tend to just settle down and enjoy life. I'm being honest.
---
I could see some vault tech researchers questioning how it is possible for someone to just sit back and relax in an apocalypse. Take mine for instance. I set up a quant little homestead north of the vault at the edge of the farm. I make fresh lemonade and tea in the morning, have a bowl of Sugar Bombs fresh from the factory and brahmin milk. Around lunch time I have a cram burger with potato crisps with a Nuka Cola. At dinner I have a brahmin steak with a bottle of wine with starlight berry cobbler for desert.
---
Now that I think of it, I could just imagine my character pulling a Pyro from TF2. Everything looks delightful, but they are actually committing crimes against humanity as they go about their routine.
---
can only daily quests once a day, cuz they’re .. daily, u know? (feel free to correct me on this though)
---
and yes, those 2 dailies can drop badges
---
Yes, that was my point. I'm not big on selling, I would either drop duplicates right away or donate them to someone who doesn't have them. I was asking more specifically, like for a list of those unique plans since I couldn't find the answer anywhere, I wouldn't blame you if you don't know neither. That's because I don't really want to waste time on something that gives rewards I have already collected. Thank you though.
---
how many desk fans have been scrapped so far
---
Ooooh! So this is the cause. I have had 2 crashes this patch from spam-using stuff in the pipboy
---
well every challenge but these are account wide I can't get atoms for doing 90% of things across characters and dailys and weeklys are account wide as well just not these grindy ones
---
and lets face it running a athlete course 5 times isn't fun its just a grind to unlock something. Now the basic quest I agree should be needed to unlock the rest and plans should be no drop so people can't just make characters to sell plans to keep balance (if they want to make backpacks to only people who crafted them for some unholy reason)
---
Yup, this has been there since player vending started. When it’s brought up people want to claim it’s only a visual bug but it’s definitely not. The ammo is sold, the buyer pays 1c per ammo, but you’ll only get a tiny amount of the entire sale. I’ve sold over 1000 ammo and only got 8c. I screenshot before and after the sale to show I legit just got 8c but all that ammo did sell. It’s really shitty and needs to be addressed soon
---
Marine Tactical Helmet is in the game
---
(Same design as the underarmour)
---
I can craft it for you if you want
---

What about K-9 from Vegas?
---
Also, Rex from Fallout 2 is/was alive in 2072? So, Rex is around in 2076.
---
thx for the info ! Will keep trying :)
---
Well they said 16x the rendering. So your game is rendered useless 16x faster. The have you what they promised.
---
I'm not sure I understand you correctly. Yes, daily quests (Stings and things &amp; Cleaning up toxic waste) can be only done once a day and as you say, I have a chance of getting a badge from them. What I thought before is that I only have a chance for the badge from the repeatable Campfire tales event. Thank you
---
You're welcome. :)
---
You're missing out though... standing at the targeting computer... finger in the button... the power to summon a scorchbeast queen or flatten your friend's camp...
---
One of the better moments in the game.
---
I fully support this suggestion.
---
Legendary vendor is another route.  I got my TSE railway rifle there
---
Yeah. I really want them to fix this :( it's the worst when it *used* to be fine, then they broke it.
---
While I agree that there needs to be a perk that reduces rifle weight, or an existing rifle perk could have the effect added onto it, there are also ways of dealing with becoming overencumbered(which is the only reason this matters).
---
Firstly, reducing the weight from other sources.  Aid/Chems and Food/Water are likely the largest contributors to anyones weight, and both of those categories have a weight reducing perk.  Using those perks to any degree &amp;/or limmiting the number of certain items you have on you will do more for your weight than a perk that reduces the weight of rifles.  And since one of those perks is in Agility, outside of min/maxing damage, there's no reason to not use it.
---
If you pick up too much, are unable to fast travel and there isn't a stash all that close, there are still things that can be done.  Endurance reduces both the AP cost of sprinting as well as running while over encumbered; this doesn't mean you need to invest in Endurance outright, as there are food/chems that increase it, and you could even use Unyielding armor for the +15 Endurance with a full set(the +15 Agility, Perception and Lucky also help the typical builds, in regards to VATS, but don't buff damage like with Melee/Strength).
---
Other than Endurance, having more Agility and thus AP, also helps as it means you can move futher before needing to take a break.  Sneaking also uses a lot less AP while over encumbered and with Sleek on both legs, you move only slightly slower than normaly running speed.  Alternatively, you could use Speed Demon alongside Gun Runner and a light pistol you can swap to while moving; this allows you to cover more ground at the same AP cost wile over encumbered.
---
Of course, the best option would be getting ahold of  a full set of 3 star armor with the reduce weapon weight effect.  If you can get to 25+ Agility the only things that will ever really notice you in stealth are other players and Scorchbeast(and they cheat, stupid echolocation), so the 3 star effect that makes you harder to detect wouldn't matter anyway.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice
---
Same thing happened with the Mayor for a Day Quest. I was at the last stage, I’m not trying to spoil it for people who haven’t completed it, and I got disconnected from the server. I had to go all of the way back to finding the things from the saboteur. Not to mention, finding the saboteur’s things is also bugged in the sense of you HAVE to collect them in a certain order or they won’t be “collected”. Anyways, I was able to finish, but that took and extra 30-50 minutes that wasn’t needed.
---
The rare ones spawn every few days, in some cases a group had to jump through hoops to spawn it.
---
best thing ever... I love mine fresh corn soup and cranberry cobbler for days
---
You know you can just buy the plan now, right?
---
There are 5 mounted plans to get from stings and things. Bloatfly, radroach, stingwing, tick, and bloodbug mounts. 
---
From Free Range you can get the Sheepsquatch Crook, Club, and staff. Also mods for each. For crook there are the horned, glass covered, toothed, spiked, and electrified mods. For the clubs and staffs, there are burning, barbed, burning barbed, electrified, poisoned, and heavy mods each.
---
Thx for answering ! and Yea that's where I got most of the pics ! (I'm still looking for stingwing &amp; *snallygaster) . Will keep trying. :) hope you'll get yours too !
---
I coukdn't even milk my own brahmin. 
---
I tried placing a second fertilizer resource, and it wouldn't let me. I had half my budget left, plenty of razorgrain, and couldn't place another brahmin.
---
You can try different events my personal favorites are ( one violent night, camp fire tales, free range, scorched earth, any enclave events) there's one in the mire too I just can't remember the name... Something swamp? You have to kill a giant strangled pod? Well it has waves of enemies to kill and 1 or 2 legendary enemies will spawn up usually 3*... Also eat some cranberry relish or any cranberry based food or drink it gives you an xp boost for a few min...
---
Want to write "penis" on your house? Gotta pay up.

SAME PROBLEM . i literally farms legendarys till i cant carry no more. Haha might even stop playing JUST BECAUSE i have to wait a while 24 hours just to get rid of all those legendarys the next day. at least 500 scrips a day would be legit . haha

I snagged a plain quad double barrel for 100caps.  This thing is love!
---
:-)
---
Good to know that and thanks  ! guess what I'll need now is luck :P
---
Powerarmor user or not?
---
Just confirmed something else - you can turned creatures into scorched by having a SB use their attack on it.   I just watched it happen - so if you can lure a SB to some stingwings and get them in the line of fire, it will help.   Some other player killed the legendary Stingwing I found to try this with :(    But it should work.
---
Yes. Happened to me as well. Thought I was going crazy. Ended the night with over 70 and when I logged in the next day it was around 18...
---
OP,  priming the receiver is the answer - you'll be making around 100 ammo in average per 1 fluorescent flux (with Ammosmith 2 and SupDup 3).
---
Also I could trade you my spare primed 2* TSE LMG - I am looking or AA25 LMG or AA25 50 cal, not caps.
---
Because you're uncoordinated?
---
That would of been helpful lol not sure what's better I use power armour at the moment but only the excovator armor.
---
Would this build be better without PA?
---
I'm hoping for a candy basket in the style of the punch bowl when that time comes around, as to further encourage trick or treating
---
Its like this one's mate, but different. But the same.
---
Was just about to post this!! All the yes.
---
If we are willing to put in the time and grind to get star items to turn in, I feel like we should be rewarded for that. If we want to play let us play. --  Once I run out of scrip to redeem I find myself logging off for the day and waiting until it refills the next day. If they want us to play more we need more reason to play, and right now scrip is it. (For those of us deep in late game.)
---
As a side,  I know they limit scrip and other things in the game to try and guide the in game economy in a certain direction,  But I don't know why there is a trend in newer games where they feel like if everyone has a good gun then the economy is broken. Destiny 2 just did this with a huge nerf to the best guns in game. Definitely don't agree with this trend.
---
They'll make em a guaranteed drop but when you log on it'll turn into a Drill :p
---
I feel like they could add a normal mr handy as well that would go around and repair structures that have been hit a tiny bit but you can’t repair normally 
---
Otherwise this post is gold
---
Heart of the Swamp! Yeah, that is a rare one!
---
Yea only reason I bought it too
---
True but it’s useless no matter if it’s day or night
---
I just joined the Encryptid event. I was able to revive someone within 10 seconds
---
That's why I'm staying away from Survival mode. All the people who actually know what they're doing, with the perfect combination of perks and legendaries and serums and diseases so they can kill you with one shot of a 10mm.
---
This is exactly what I meant by a candy bowl on my porch. You better believe that ill be dressed up with a lawn chair sitting out front waiting for people to show up. :D
---
Maybe even add somewhat friendly PvP  where you can egg, TP, or Stink Bomb your fellow vault dwellers camp? Who knows?
---
How the hell did you do that on 2 days?
---
YEP!
---
Wanna go up to my room and build a fort?
---
Personally I got bored doing all of that, I think I did it twice and got bird bones which I didn’t want, so got rid and just bought them, when I bought them the price was really low like 150-200 per mutation, the recent update has brought their price up a lot though
---
I just recently got a 2 shot plasma rifle from the SBQ. My friend could hear the excitement in my voice. I've always been am energy weapon guy. My 2 shot plasma rifle hardly gets used. It's incredibly underwhelming. I use my beefed up laser rifle more.
---
Go register as a responder in Flatwoods tavern at one of the terminals.
---
Serums are too cheap to bother trying to get mutations in the wild.
---
I worked on getting the ones I wanted for a week and had no success. The chances of you getting one you don't want (and removing that specific one) are very low. Now you can easily get them for 300 caps a piece no rng involved.
---
I think I did that already
---
I gambled on like 8-10 of them because with class freak the negatives don’t matter much. Only serums I bought were bird bones and adrenal reaction because I was tired of the process of actually getting mutated.
---
Its a possum badge.
---
The world is your oyster. Just explore. Complete missions. Do side quests. Engage in the daily events. Talk to people. Build a C.A.M.P. There’s a ton of stuff to do with all the updates bringing new content to the game. Have fun!
---
That should start off a few quests that advance the story
---
Junk, legendary weapons and armor, ammo, fusion cores, plans, outfits, nuclear key cards, mainframe cores, any times of meds and mods. Just think of stuff you'd want to buy and throw it in there
---
Which event do you hop to get a badge?
---
I play on the PC too and I don’t have that many people to play with either. I could help you with quests and stuff like that if you’d like. I’m not currently on, but I’m probably going to be real soon. My IGN is IconsForHire.
---
I paid 3 or 4k for mine.
---
I tried for a couple hours to get adrenal reaction + marsupial without getting electrically charged, herd mentality, or empath - it's statistically (almost) impossible. I did manage to get everything but I'm stuck with herd mentality :/
---
Before wasting money on serums it's worth spending a few hours trying to get exactly what you want and see what happens
---
Pick up notes , read terminals and listen to holo tapes.
---
Cafepress it!  I'd buy that shirt.
---
Yeah, I don't think the scrip should be unlimited, but a slightly higher amount would be nice. 200 or 250, maybe.
---
The one at camp adams but its LITERALLY like a 15% drop rate BUT SOMETIMES it rewards you with 2 at a time but only sometimes haha might take you couple hours or so..
---
I would just generally say, endurance perks suck, sunkissed, cannibal and even ghoulish are a waste of perk points imo. I'm not big on explosives neither so I would drop the ordnance express as well, but if that is what you want go for it. I would get some kind of protection, Evasive in luck or Barbarian in STR if you are not PA user, Stabilized in INT if you are PA user for dmg. I would get something else in Agility so you have at least 2 points for swapping in Ammosmith while crafting ammo. You may want to consider White knight/ Action boy or Adrenaline for that matter.
---
I learned a long ago that this game is not particulary hard and you can steamroll through most of it even with unoptimized builds (like me) so you can do whatever you fell like basically.
---
This happened to my yesterday as well. After I shot him for the loot my wife yells, “WHY DID YOU SHOOT HIM? HE WAS SURRENDERING!”
---
Robocop is the best
---
That error is with vendors, haven't seen it on player vending machines.
---
Plus ammo for the railway rifle is cheaper to make, and buy.
---
Vault Tech C.A.M.P™
---
With exactly identical durability bars?  Very unlikely, angry stranger.  I have never seen natural drops stack, do your instigating shotguns stack?  Duped weapons stack.
---
If you are on PC, perk manager works after Patch 9.5 and it's a huge QOL improvement. Try it.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Buy a serum, but buy it from a player. If they sell it over 300 caps, don't buy.
---
Pretty sure the spawn in location is tied to the CAMP devices location. No need to move your whole base just move the CAMP then spawn in &amp; see where you end up.
---
It does seem to put owner &amp; visitors in slightly different locations but minor trial &amp; error itself can be figured out.
---
They still need to get in fast travel mats. Would've been proper to have them integrated when player vending launched frankly.
---
Nearly at the 4K mark, so with a bit of luck I should be able to get one then. Now to find someone selling one in their vending.
---
Because gat laser and X01 is badass and fallouty regadless of the stats.
---
ohhh that makes sense.
---
lets not, that would mean we now have three guns that use 5mm. 
---
personally i think .45 would be a better choice.
---
I thought you could adjust the opacity of those pop ups somewhere in settings.
---
♪♬I wanna be... your (^super) sledgehammer...
---
This is interesting but there’s too many holes for it to be a remotely viable explanation
---
You can usually get someone to place them for you as long as you provide the mats. No need to buy unless you want to use them 24/7.
---
For heavy weapons, people usually go for PA because of the Stabilized perk for armor pen but it is in no way a must. I was asking because of the lack of defensive perks that are kinda necessary for a low health build outside PA. There is also a PA torso mod that is good for low health build but I don't remember the name.
---
And a thing that tells time
---
I have been on the "it's a simulation" train for a long time, makes sense to me.
---
hey whenever you‘re back try to hit me up if you‘re on PS4 i‘ll try to get some shit for you maybe like plans and stuff that will come with updates and all?
---
If a mod to make the drum bigger I would scream like a little girl in excitement. I love my Prime AAE with reduced vats LMG. I mow scorched beast down in a second
---
And that is when you succeed to fast travel....most of the time, I have to go to the map 2/3 times to travel
---
 jetpack and modded legs for ap reg. bird bones and masupial mutation is also recommended.
---
its hard to explain in detail, but there are a lot of youtubevids which shows how it works.
---
btw, how do you get this "order of Mysteries" tag?
---
So, just like it is often in real life?
---
Did you already do this? If not I’ll come help.
---
I heard its coming, but it shouldn't. Not being legendary is a trade off for the greater amount of protection afforded.
---
Cool thanks for the advice everyone
---
The camp Brahmin hates me. Never provides milk just an attempted kick. End up going to the Flatwoods everytime. 
---
Spawned attacks on my camp increased dramatically with the placement of the bastard as well so I got rid of it. My camp has been in the same spot, on both characters, for months now &amp; I've never had a Charred Ghoul attack until that Brahmin pen. I'd say players visiting but my shop isn't exactly popular.
---
~10 min until touchdown.
---
I’d prefer to get my own so that I can always freely move them if I decide to change my camp design/location. Plus it’d allow me to change my planned name if needed
---
BUT if you're at say 980 script and you go to scrap a 3* weapon for 40 script... they'll happily let that happen...
---
AHAHAHAHAHA that’s too funny! I do kinda feel bad when they do that but then I think maybe it’s a trap and if I stand down then he will be like “HAHA STUPID BUCKET HEAD IM GONNA KILL YOUUUUU”
---
The MG42 is my favorite gun in the game but unfortunately it chews through .308 like its nothing.  They should either boost the amount of .308 you get per craft so it is on par with 5mm and .50 Cal. or simply change it from using .308 to 5mm.  The damage it deals is in a great place but could use more mods.  It only has the Prime Receiver as of now.
---
I can be on in a little while if you still need help!:)
---
The lines would be long with unlimited or much higher scrip would they  not? But yeah how about just a couple hundred more, I'm going to start leaving my legendaries in cash registers again : It's not worth hoarding the damn things at all trying to make sure I get scrip for them all. Once I hat max level for the day I'm giving those suckers away to someone
---
TBH fatman itself is just a big slingshot the mini nuke is the real weight
---
The night vision lens is in one of the vending machines at the pioneer scout camp.
---
&gt; If you build your character a certain way, forget using half the games weapons.
---
That's deliberate.
---
*Leaves the candy*
---
*Takes the bowl instead*
---
"I only took one. You didnt say what one I was allowed to take"
---
NO problem
---
Thank you for speaking up. I play an awful lot and have the same issue but didn't want to think it was across the board even for people who only play a couple hours a day. If you are having the same problem I am they need to raise the scrip cap. It shouldn't be unlimited I guess but it should be a little bit higher to be sure
---
my first roll was the 3 \* bloodied mole miner guantlet
---
Im surprised that I also prefer it this way.
---
When it dropped, I tried to play with friends and we had tons of fun, but as time passed I had to be honest and admit that I prefer it alone. Sometimes I went to the main menu, checked social and saw friends on, and closed the game! Other times I remember checking social, fully planning on joining whomever was on, but then felt a sigh of relief when nobody was online. I cant explain it.
---
W8......FO3 was a simulation?
---
The lack of head protection in this game is sad!
---
I got marsupial by accident once collecting water in the stream behind FW..
---
once i was ready for real it took me about 30 minutes of looking for what I wanted in player vendors.. lol
---
How does one find a guild?
---
Damn. Your world is full
---
Mine still loads 8 shells, but the fire rate is amazing, and so is the damage and reload speed. Beastly on Squatch and Queen runs.
---
Me too. It's something that's been talked about in the past.
---
They all stack if they're identical, duped or not.
---
This is the only correct answer right here
---
Ign: asully102
---
I'll be on later today and I'll help you out. In water I'm assuming?
---
It would fix half the problem. Loading the camp still takes too much time, you will still have a timeframe where you can run through the walls.
---
Emmet Mountain disposal site is the best place to gamble mutations. There is a decontamination shower just to the left inside the bunker, and a fat pile of toxic barrels to stand near just inside the bunker. Farming junk, selling bulk every day is more fun than gambling on the mutation combinations. I did it for 5 straight days of 4+ hours each day trying and eventually got tired of it. Made a list of every mutation I wanted and found someone to sell them to me.
---
I know, and there isn’t any reason why this helmet shouldn’t be in the game
---
Not WestTek for me, I did Emmet Mountain; there’s a rad shower inside the building (near WestTek and not as hard to clear)
---
On the first character, I basically hopped servers all day and got most of them. I’m ok with most of them. There were a few I didn’t want, and I did a bit of radaway magic back and forth towards the end there, then just stopped.
---
On the other two I bought serums and got just the ones I wanted.
---
Does AA work for energy weapons yet? I know it was having issues.
---
I've found I have one in my inventory, I stuck it in my vendor at a stupid price because I have nothing better to do with it xD
---
I got my first one really easily. I simply walked into a nuke zone with no power armour or hazmat. I stayed near the edge just enough so I could walk out before dying, got mutated. I wasnt trying for a mutation I just happened to get one while wandering in for the fun of it!
---
The rest I just bought serums. 
---
It's probably easier to there is player vendors. Many vendors sell the serums, often at a really good price.
---
I've seen others saying Scorchbeast guano piles can also spawn them.  I've only found 1 so far and I already forget what kind of container it was in.
---
Yeh, I've just started exploring again. So much to see in 76 and do. It's hard trying to get it all done and see all there is to see, especially when they just keep adding stuff!! Won't comlian though, still go loads of side quests to do and I'm 550+ hours in.
---
No this is a really late reply, but wanted to let you folks know that I scored a 3 star poisoners urban scout armor arm from the Purveyor today, so apparently that's one avenue to getting more legendary scout armor.
---
Scorched Earth spawns every type of scorched enemy, but its RNG.
---
Same problem here, killed 3 sheepsquatches at Free range and it didn't work, gave up afterwards. Honestly, to hell with broken, overcomplicated and photographic daily challenges.
---
Sure, dupers weren't bad enough. Let's flood the market with farmers also. Devalue all the things.
---
I see a lot of people mentioning TS Quad in this thread, did Quad used to be a major, instead of primary effect? AFAIK right now, TS and Quad can’t exist on the same weapon. Did that used to be different?
---
At the very least we can do this ourselves by decorating and putting items in our vending for free. But I would love to have it be an official event.
---
After I got marsupial bird bones and eagle eye I pretty much stopped.  But here's what I did.  Make sure you have a single starched genes untill you're good to lock it down.  If you have one card and use diluted radaway one at a time to gamble on which mutation gets cured.  I just did one mutation a day.
---
Seriously this. I know they tend to “buy” for the same amount at in-world vendors but they are sooooo much easier to make.
---
I have 150 or so on my heavy character.
---
Ok can you invite to team whenever you start my GT is E011EVEN
---
I expected this to be top comment :O
---
Yogi just wants his picnic basket and after the war they became rather scarce.
---
you are a god
---
I read people asking for that a while ago, unless it's a different challenge? I've just got around to doing the scout quest and it says "Kindness: Revive an ally". So either it's a different one or they made it easier?
---
So its not just me thinking...havent I done this already? But when I looked for the requested object(s) in inventory, I could not find them,
---
Any idea where they are saved?
---
It seems to me per session, it remembers/marks the “next” phase, but also (re)assigns the first.  
---
For example, I Obtained the object from both the wendigo cave and trapper site last night, then it assigned me the one near sunnytop, which, if I remember, is going to send me back to the path of the wind site - from which I’ve already recovered the object for rose 2x...
---
Oh shit its from the dev room? I got it from a pal, scrapped it, and learned how to make it. Hope I dont get banned
---
I thought chameleon effect/mutation only works for players (PVP). PVE mobs are not fooled by it, they only care about your AGI score and sneak perks and other sneaky modifiers.
---
That's fucking awesome! How do you get your camp to float though?!
---
And to think I hunt them and Scorchbeasts on a regular basis.
---
And the Fatman still does trash for damage compared to weight and ammo weight 😂
---
It sure is fun to use though
---
I carry one on my melee character because I occasionally need to shoot something. It used to be a Instigating Dragon, but now it’s an Instigating, Limb Damage ... something else ... Railway.
---
Toot toot!
---
Afraid I don't have legendaries worth that, just caps. Thanks though
---
Got hit twice back to back yesterday at least half the server showed up for both, had zero issues killing her either time. 
---
Its pretty hard to put any one thing in this game "in the same basket." The player base is wildly diverse, each server will be as well.
---
Got an AAE from legendary vender last night and am able to use it for about 45 seconds.
---
Serums always sell
---
That is so incredibly awesome, but I just had this vision of a player in power armor running past me towards a downed player going "WEEEWOOOOWEEEWOOOO" like an ambulance on the mic and i had to stop myself from laughing too hard or I'd wake up my fam
---
They could also add toilet paper as a throwable to tp camps
---
How many vault dwellers have fallen into a fissure site?
---
How many paper bags lost to the depths of the burning, green hell pits? 
---
How many noobs accidentally wandering into a blast zone with no radiation protection?
---
I believe you can only get it from the random Responder vendor by Charleston station (same vendor that has the Hunter's Long Coat)
---
And its probably for a limited time, as your right, they want them tied to individual characters. Guessing next patch or two the plan will get fixed.
---
This is A AMAZING IDEA!!! Its seems like you put a lot of work into this and i really like this idea!
---
Go to data. In your pip boy and check out what missions you have available. Sometimes they get un ticked. But mostly id say explore the area that is the forest... Once you get outside of that things kinda ramp up in difficulty. Start hoarding all of the scrap to get a basic base going then explore and uncover the stories. Make sure your looking thru notes for plans and recipes you have found and scrap all the guns you find to start unlocking mods.
---
Happened to me just yesterday. And yeah, I do recall that same error when trying to buy Spoiled stuff from vendor bots
---
i was devastated a while back when trying to get the whole set :( 
---
sentry bot helmet is as close as it gets
---
On my way!
---
I'm on PC. Don't know that I've ever experienced this. Same with my buddy I play with.  Might be a local issue.
---
A mathemiracle.  Did you get all 6 in one run?  Ive gotten two of the exact same drop from whitesprings before, but it only seemed to happen when legendary ghouls respawn.
---
**Daily: Trick or Treat?** 
---
Still broken for my character. No irradiated pumpkin seeds for me too.
---
Damn queued...
---
that doesnt sound fun to me
---
165 days. We can make this happen.
---
This is a great idea. I'd love to see robot and science perks incorporated more and stuff like this would fit perfectly for these concepts.
---
It’s from the dev room? Dang it... I bought one from a player’s vending machine.
---
Should I scrap it? Discard it in a lake? Not worry about it?
---
Leader of the pack over near the Ferris wheel
---
Ammo, meds, plans, maybe even bulk scrap. Basic stuff we use all the time
---
Only thing you need for PVE is a good legendary weapon, then you can have highly unoptimized build and still steamroll through most of the game. I'm not very well versed in PVP mechanics tho. Your points seem all valid, but I would like to ask how did you arrive at the conclusion the Heavy build is best for PVE?
---
No but there’s a quest inside one
---
Where do we find this thing?
---
Not on PC, sorry
---
Yeah people have been saying their glitched, occasionally someone manages to find one but their spawns are definitely messed up since the last patch
---
I wasn't a fan of big guns either, but, with the Stabalized perk, (requirement that you be in PA) big guns will fucking vaporize a large enemy, (I routinely drop SB's solo, and have several times dropped flocks of three alone) and absolutely decimate packs of enemies.
---
That said, the AK47, errr, I mean, "Handmade" is my go to weapon for medium-close quarters combat.  If you haven't already, try a good combat rifle w/powerful auto receiver, reduced recoil, (Stabilized? Aligned?) Shirt barrel and stock, stinging magazine, and a maxed out Concentrated Fire perk. I was dropping 
---
LvL 100+ players and big game enemies in my 30's and 40's with that combo. The Tank Killer perk cards are a big booster here as well, and apply to both semi-auto and full-auto rifles.
---
Sounds pretty accurate
---
Think they patched it out
---
And that's why you aren't a video game designer.
---
Would you consider trading or selling that one?
---
Thx for your information !
---
Inertia...or is it momentum? I can never keep them straight. I just came to me that it would be cool if higher agility nerfed incoming staggers.
---
Yeah I have to stockpile ammo and I still have to haul out my Gatling Gun when fighting a boss type enemy like a scorchbeast or the imposter sheepsquatch just because the ammo won't last.
---
You know the sheepsquach quest? Where you go into the secret room and find the Assaultron terminal etc? In the secret room there is a dead wolf and a dead fox in the yellow container with the animal parts. Take a photo of that, it counts.
---
Are you sure that's LMG? As they only come with 75-ammo magazine...
---
Ah, you just started the Tadpole challenges. I'll have you Revive me in water so you can knock off two tasks at once. There's a Tadpole world challenge named Swimmer. It's a fairly easy one to do with Revive in water being the toughest, so might as well get that out of the way
---
This is a very prestigious award! Or it was... until someone fed it...
---
If that was the case, and they made an intentional adjustment to the game,why wouldn’t they just adjust spawn rate or simply take one of the GBs out? 
---
I highly doubt this.  My guess is is simply a bug.
---
I don’t think you should worry about it, but I have heard if you scrap it you will learn the plan, might want to double check if I’m right because I’m not sure.
---
A week? You probably meant about a month.
---
I spawned halfway in the wooden base floor and got stuck there. Yelled help and the store owner gave me question mark emotes. This needs to be fixed.
---
Exactly.
---
Is regular 76 any better? Micro transactions, shitty gimmicks, boring?
---
Ive got about 8k.. I need decent gear... 1k on mutations is probably a good bet tbh. Thanks again ill keep a look out at shops and probably get 1 for free
---
Yeah you're right, I confused it with my .50 cal machine gun.
---
Maybe I’ll give it a shot. I do know someone who desperately needs their camp flattened.
---
It has to be the pip-boy, I thought it was just me so I was happy to see this post. It's the only time I crash is when I'm looking into it for food. 
---
The only thing better would be to stop from being overcomed so anyone can fast travel because of their weight, other than that I love this game and I've played since beta so I've been through and heard it all I've got almost 600 hours into the game 
---
    Thank you Bethesda  for the great game
---
Sadly not, I play on console, that perk manager would be game changing so I’m a little jealous lol
---
Big thanks for launching that, much appreciated!!
---
Yep, usually have 20k 5mm, 15k .50, and pretty much 0 .308 because I use it right away.
---
Sorry fellas, CAMP budget means we can only build cubes to live in. No forts for you.
---
I'm glad I didn't speed run the story line either. I had a balance of doing all the things, then finished the story line, but now I still have so much exploring to do. I am still apprehensive to explore the mire, because I seem to get wrecked everytime I go in there even with my ultracite power armor ;_;
---
Yeah, I bought a treasure map somebody listed for 0
---
Not at the moment, no. Just got it and would like to hold out to see if they help us out with this ammo.
---
It’s kinda like most fallouts. Look for a greyed out icon on the map and follow it. Do quests/build/whatever on your way. You’re in for a good time. For a game that has no npcs imo the story is pretty good
---
It’s a pretty cool view on things
---
I think it would be cool if the scorched where actually survivors of the bombs and the gas makes us hostile towards them - some cruel vault experiment
---
Not as bad, a BE handmade can keep up, but at long range theres no hope
---
What system do you play on?
---
Solomons pond in the savage divide sometimes spawns wolves.
---
Plasma gun beta wave tuner
---
??
---
Np, mate, happy hunting.
---
I have everything I need, I've been trying to find a deal on an AAE combat shotgun for my step brother.
---
😂😂😂
---
Ok thanks, I should be around later, just leave me a reply here when you next play. Thanks so much!
---
Does the other challenge complete automatically? I don't have it on my list atm..
---
Dying with only one spawn point has been happening for me since day one, I thought that was how it was supposed to be until I saw the loading screen saying I could spawn at the vault, but that’s never ever been an option for me.
---
Stop replying to a dead post to a dead game
---
If you're on pc I can craft a few for you for free.
---
Van make 11 different types of serums
---
Plans for the most part. Of course I'll check out any legendary offers, I've seen a few really good deals but they didn't fit my builds or cap amounts (was max caps on both characters until vending appeared).
---
Now I think I'm subconsciously stealing build ideas. The creativity, especially where this wanky building system is involved, it just amazing.
---
Have you tested if chameleon actually helps you stay hidden from mobs? I thought they only care about your AGI and sneak perks.
---
lol what price did you make it?
---
You have to find random spawn locations and server hop there for tameable creatures - when an animal can be tamed it will give the option to tame or pacify. You cannot just tame any animal. It must be a random spawn
---
Probably one of the most epic pictures I've seen posted. Super ominous.
---
Well for me it only is available as a level 20 which is pretty useless for a 50+ character. Making the plan the reward would at least make it more interesting.
---
I'm going to start stacking toilet paper rolls and raw uh.... Fertilizer.
---
A leveling weapon for my lvl 30 sniper

Morgantown if you need the crafting bits for stable flux. Generals steakhouse if you need flux. WS/Harper's for legendaries, and SBQ for the first time experience.
---
Plans, sometimes junk, and 2 star armor for the wife.
---
The clipping would be a nightmare for so many outfits though. D: And that’d bug me more than not having them.
---
Now explain to me why Daisycutter, which has 90% reduced weight, weighs 6 pounds. Last I checked 6 is not 10% of 20.
---
I need the plans for TP grenades.
---
I love this gun in general it’s good all around for me
---
I do love a combat shotgun anyway as well
---
No it’s inconvenient, I guess you want to retrieve your loot.
---
You know where you had to get wolf blood in the Ash heap? That's a good place to look at.
---
🤣
---
I'm usually hunting plans. Hopefully I'll find a plan I haven't got, and have often found just the plan I'm looking for. Usually I find nothing unknown, but there is always that one time I find exactly what I'm looking for. Or an unexpected bonus (such as a serum recipe).
---
I'll take a look at weapons/armour too, you never know.
---
But regardless, I just enjoy seeing other camps. Some have been absolutely amazing. It's great to see players creativity and it can be very inspiring. That alone is worth the travel costs even if they have nothing i need for sale.
---
It's one of those Demonstrate Scout Values. You have to look at the challenges, scroll down to World, and you'll see a bunch of them. You have to pick three from that list
---
Ohh so pasify isn't the same? That would explain what in seeing then. Tyvm
---
Well first you need a rusty key. :)

---
I am thinking of selling mine
---
You're either over exaggerating or you simply have speed demon and parasites.
---
I haven't done that quest yet actually, how do you trigger it?
---
Dammit Muskrat, I'm a conspiracy theorist not a cartographer! :P
---
I mean has it not been this way in every fallout with nv?
---
It's right near widows perch, if you fast travel there &amp; walk a tiny bit northwest you'll run smack dab in the middle of em.
---
Was the first place I thought of when I started that challenge, used it on both characters thus far.
---
I also have this problem.
---
I was lucky enough to get a 3*** Ghoul Slayer Radium rifle dropped when I was just a level 25.
---
It absolutely shreds through the enemies at Whitesprings, but it is still got no mods even though I have made and scrapped about 7 😭
---
All I want is a suppressor
---
Just wander around the forest region, toxic valley (up north), and then the Ash heap (South East). Quest come to you over time.
---
Adding those 4 vendors, good bye decorations. Lol
---
They did fix alot of bugs since release 😁
---
To be fair the Fat Man is garbage in this game.
---
Ha! That's pretty much what I was going for. 
---
I think the Firebreather firetruck/ambulance paints are coming out next week, which are pretty much the only paint so far I particularly like, so I figured I'd start up a new character
---
You’re a wonderful wastelander! I used to drop water and dog food at vault 76 entrance. Someone said paperbags will disappear shortly after you log off, now when I have extra I leave them in the lunch pails at the train stations.
---
Exactly. Thanks for putting the info out. I just woke up and scrolled through the feeds and found this post
---
The mire is tough stuff. I was exploring the other day and was ambushed by like 5 glowing mirelurk kings, a diseased mirelurk queen and a glowing hermit crab for good measure. After dying like 5 times running a sniper build i decided to change the perks up, jump in my pa and try again with my instigating super sledge. Took a while, but I got it. 
---
Those hermits ain't nothin to fudge with, my friend.
---
I think the only limit / problem Bethesda has is the amount of data there using - I’m sure they have many good ideas in the works but it would be hard to implement for because the game storage would be too big (it’s already quite big for some consoles)
---
Thats nice not on xbox but thanks though
---
I think it's because of basic repair kits being Atom Shop items, and no repair kit is suppose to be merchandise. Mainly socialist economics.
---
Just toss this out there, quite a few of the tadpole &amp; possum challenges are currently impossible to complete due to triggers not activating or items just outright missing (stimpak diffuser whatever the hell it is).
---
I did athlete, hunter &amp; archery (crossbow being the biggest pain out of those imo). I know swimmer can be completed as well so that's a good one to stick with.
---
I'm hoping they have some new legendary effects specific for power armor. But I have a character that loves in the PA and the resistances make the difference. But when I need to travel around, since I got a cool and hip backpack, I can hop out and go loot crazy 😂
---
You start by looking at a “sheepsqatch ate my brother” poster, they’re free in the atom shop so you can craft your own. Do the first part of that, and then do the “investigate the park” bit to get to that part quickly. But it’s nothing drastically difficult.
---
I don’t use Facebook - is there a discord server?
---
Not on pc*
---
Go to Big Fred’s BBQ northwest of Whitespring. If the quest Free Range doesn’t trigger immediately, just server hop a couple times. Once it starts, inspect the robot in the middle of the Brahmin and get the crook weapon and use it on the Brahmin. After they start walking for a few seconds and stop, wolves will appear
---
Just surf shops, don't pay over 300 per though, i sell mine for 200 and people seem to eat them up and i know I'm not the only one selling cheap serums, might take a bit to find a cheap seller but we are out there.
---
Thanks for replying. I think I have scrapped about 100-200 now and have all but 7 mods 🤣
---
Once I get those 7 I was going to offer a radium rifle modding service. But dunno what to charge.
---
Dunno, I hit "C" on my keyboard a couple of time, so it's probably 2,000 - 4,000 caps.
---
I don't expect anyone to actually pay that.
---
I also have a Commendation medal. no idea where from, I assume a quest, that i've put at 25,000 just 'cos I can. Again, no expectation of selling it (and i kinda hope it doesn't as i doubt i can replace it)
---
Regular armour having legendary traits is what makes it the best armour in the game. Regular armour is the only way you can surpass power armour damage resistance and now with the most recent update you can have more storage than good power armour with calibrated shocks. So in reality power armour has nothing going for itself.
---
It seems they fix indeed a lot of bugs. But new bugs arises and old bugs coming back with it.
---
My Gatling Gun is the reason. :)
---
Its like a Combat Shotgun with an infinite magazine, much better range and accuracy. The switch from my AAE Combat Shotgun to the AAE Gatling was an eye opener for me.
---
I like the cut of your jib.
---
Only for me as far as I can tell.
---
I can move fine on the over world but whenever I enter a building through a load screen I have inconsistent movement. Being in power armor seems to cause it every time. Gets really aggravating when I cant play just because I can never move.
---
Just pop a rad-x before collecting water.
---
I'm in the same boat for PC.. I'm starting to feel like I should have jumped on this while it was still red hot..
---
gl and safe travels when you finally get it!
---
My advice for the mire, a stealth approach. Probably my favorite area, but you definitely need to approach it slowly rather than all guns blazing... Also a miners hat, the torch is excellent with the bright mod for seeing the really dark areas, a flick on just to check the surroundings really helps. I use a Bloodied Sniper build for PvE, then switch to AA in Pvp. I'm the mire a high damage rifle will kill most things with ease, its just you gotta watch out for things that come out of nowhere with speed, Cave Cricket pierces have pulled my pants down a few times lol.
---
Maybe shell drop a 3* wood chest lol that way it becomes a 1* later. 
---
#LaughsInBethesda
---
&gt; cant craft a better version...
---
So when you ar in the craft menu @ the PA station, you can see the pieces, but all you can see is 25 for the level, or you cant see the pieces at all? 
---
If the former, once you select the piece, you should then be able to select a higher level - of course, your level has to be equal to or better than the level you are trying to craft,....
---
That's the Blackwater bandits leader. Someone was doing Key To The Past there and you stumbled on their boss.
---
True but still cheaper to just buy the mod (if you can find it). I mean how many calibrated shocks/jet packs does anyone really need anyway?
---
Yeah every game that gets updated regularly has this problem. I don't find it game breaking
---
Pm sent
---
Hm, I'm online now, I'll see if Grainger is glitched for me and report back.
---
Lead, brass, and gunpowder should be the rewards for ballistic ammo. Something similar for energy and explosives as well.
---
I’ve encountered most of those issues, yet I still play every day, Bethesda have really worked at fixing these bugs since launch and to be fair, they’ve done a brilliant job so far. 
---
Hopefully they’ll get these resolved soon too.
---
Nah, they've been cycling between players for a few months now, you are fine.
---
The game has so much problems that need fixing. Do you think a "trick or treat" mechanic is what Bethesda should focus on? I mean it is only one day and after that the event is gone and we are left with mindless grinding at Whitesprings.
---
Because caps are easy to come by.
---
Athlete, Swimmer, and Mammology work too. I actually found Athlete to be fun
---
Especially at Camp Venture doing the course running from a Scorchbeast
---
For example...?
---
Hey man! I normally adventure solo but if you would like some support or an adventure companion, feel free to add me- IGN: iGhostfire92
---
I can see this being a thing. Laggy servers seem to have a trouble mixing up the RNG sometimes. I've seen such servers generate almost exactly the same legendary items when killing multiple legendary enemies at (almost) the exact same time. 
---
Same with the mirrors at whitesprings. These have a very very small chance to drop a recipe. Yet on a laggy server I found 2 of them back-to-back. And treasure maps as well, I must have dug up 1000+ and the only time I ever found BoS plans (before you could get them at grafton) was 2 of them back-to-back on a shitty server.
---
That's what you get when you use commie weapons, you godless commie heathen.
---
I would hold onto it. Surely they will fix it in time, no?
---
Explains the lack of historical record to some degree, but someone (I think scavvers, not sure) tried something similar with Big MT, but people still talk about that.
---
I don't think weight has anything to do with AP cost, or if it does, it has a negligible impact. Poking around in FO76Edit, you will find that each weapon has a base AP cost. Weapons of any weight can have an arbitrary AP cost. For example, the 10mm Submachine Gun has a base weight of 3lbs and a cost of 28AP. The Handmade Rifle has a base weight of 8lbs and a cost of 32AP. Now, if we factor in what mods are available to each weapon, the Handmade can be a better VATS weapon on AP cost alone. While the game does a terrible job of communicating anything stat altering regarding weapon mods, using an automatic receiver on the Handmade reduces AP cost by 50% while increasing the weight by 15%. This is true of any weapon that can equip what is classified as an automatic receiver (except the combat shotgun which gains a 10% AP cost). The 10mm SMG receivers do not gain this AP reduction even though it is an automatic. For the Handmade, you can use an Aligned Barrel (-5% AP), Aligned Grip (-5%), Quick Eject Mag (-5% AP) and a Reflex Sight (-15% AP). I don't know whether these mods are added together first and then multiplied by the base or if they are just multiplicative, but I'll assume just multiplicative for comparisons sake. An automatic Handmade with the above attachments will use ~12 AP per shot while weighing much more than a 10mm SMG also modded for reduced AP cost. The 10mm SMG would cost 24 or 25 AP depending on if and how the game rounds.
---
I just ran through it this morning, it seems to be working fine.  Pretty funny too.
---
Getting those exact legendary parts is a huge dumb grind though, and if you try to wear non legendary regular armor while doing that you'll have a hard time even just staying alive in all the radiation in nuke zones etc.
---
Science, yo.
---
I’ve wondered this too, maybe it’s the minimum weight of the gun?
---
I would say AAE anything completely wrecks anyone crossing your path, doesn't have to be Gatling lol. Also, with the martial artist's effect nerf/bug removal on the gatling I thought the .50 cal was considered superior. Am I wrong?
---
Iv also got a free keycard if you want so you can ACTUALLY experience the whole nuke thing without chasing shit down. Totally not fair
---
Hadn't considered the possibility that my CAMP design (foundation extends beyond the cliff edge) could actually kill someone when I logged out. My vendor is above solid ground but the structure has sections with a view that aren't. Looks past time that I rebuilt to fix this potential issue. Thanks for the alert.
---
Did they actually break?  Ie, was breaking tied to disappearance?
---
And they are low level if you are doing hunter with a knife, too
---
This is due to large amount of new content added ( increasing everybody’s carry weight by 60-120) along with releasing old bugs into the game. The dupe wave put a lot of stress on the servers. Wait 2-3 updates it’ll be running smoothly
---
Many A True Nerd, Riflegaming, Widheon TV, Bad company Sarge, and Juicehead for news.
---
Yeah I watched a video where one dude took out a whole clan. It was pretty entertaining.
---
There’s a cabin to the east of vault 76 always has them
---
Dupes?
---
I have 95 improved repair kits,...
---
Stop bitching. If you hate the game so much then bitch about it on r/gaming to people who actually give a shit.
---
I will buy that waste off of ya for like 200 caps
---
 Not sure tbh, bought them off people here. Is bethesda still deleting those guns?
---
Shiz man that is sum scary stuff happening right there. feel bad for ya dude hope beth can give em you bak. did you take any clips btw. my deepest condolences that shit would make wanna quit the game.
---
Cue the NVG required challenges...
---
I think so
---
how many times I jumped trying to place this fuckin wire
---
[This post talks about its steady decline.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/baxsr8/the_alien_blasters_fall_from_glory/)
---
Yep, I’m most likely done and no, no video.
---
High agility and the sneak perks. Unyielding armor also helps a ton of you do a medium to low health build. I can sneak up to enemies in broad daylight and they don't see me.
---
I have an AAE .50 cal too, it takes longer to kill things as with my gatling. But my AAE LMG seem to be really a lot faster at killing things, but its too much ammo to be reasonable in a PvE session, its an evil PvP Gun though, so this is my only problem.
---
With a Heavy Built I could use my Gatling for PvE and my LMG for PvP.
---
Camp Fire event is where I got mine. Did the event 10 times seen wolves every time.
---
Fast travel to huntersville and just down the hill there's a cemetery with a few wolves.
---
One stab, one kill. Get the task done for the merit badge and head home with some wolf ribs.
---
Sbq fight , bring your camera too I’ve got 5-6 creatures off list in 1 picture before for Tadpole challenges
---
I think the deathclaw makes it even better because you can hardly see it  camouflaged there
---
giving stuff away to random dudes, camp near vault 76 with a vending machine of low level goodies priced at free, 
---
it's all good in the hood
---
I feel like most people who stomp around in power armor haven't played previous Fallout games and just assume it's the best because the DR/ER numbers are high.
---
That's not to say power armor is worthless. It can be very good with a bloodied or heavy weapons build and the right perks and mods.
---
Just go on the player market, buy a full set of 1 star vanguard armour, get like 2 perks that increase dr outside of power armour and you now have the same dr as power armour. After that if you just stay on the market for about a week you’d be able to find a full set of 3 star vanguard with tons of other buffs. Maybe sentinel maybe just FDC weight reduced. If really isn’t difficult.
---
I started a bloodied build as an experiment and it took 2 days to get matching marine unyielding (because I prefer the look of marine) and I’m sure you know how overpowered bloodied builds are compared to power armour. If you don’t then all I can say is that you don’t need full sentinel to pass out power armour.
---
yes i know how to sneak, i think my post was wrongly worded lol 
---
i mean how do people with power armor manage to sneak in this game since 9 of 10 players are always in PA and it‘s getting fucking ridiculous. 
---
trying to clear out a building being all sneaky and stealthy and some fucktard in PA comes running in, sees me sneaking, but doesn‘t give a single shit. how did bethesda think fallout multiplayer was going to work with so many different playstyles, it‘s beyond me. 
---
i LOVE the setting, but the n00bz in PA really kill the immersion. as if everyone‘s suddenly Enclave or BoS
---
I'd love it if, instead of pushing features for like a month, they'd just focus on bugs and quality of life stuff.
---
I love the new content, but things are borked all over.
---
Shiz dont quit it man pity loads of peeps cant jus giv you like 500-1k cap you'd get the caps to buy em bak in no time at al im not on til later but if you on xb1 will donate 1k to you as i would hate it if happened to me👍🤞✌
---
Nope some people have more specific answer but from what I know visitors spawn wherever you originally placed your C.A.M.P devi. You spawn just off where the device is currently placed
---
I'm south of Whitesprings, I keep 40+ 3* legendaries in my vending machines for 1500 a piece, 1750 for weight reduction or bloodied/aa peices. Generally sell one or two a play session. Also sell radaway, aluminum, acid, and whatever plans I come across. My only complaint is that I have to spend a large amount of time in my camp so people can see what all the effects are.
---
We can't stop here, this is bat country.
---
Okay, that seems reasonable. Thanks
---
That's a really good point. My lack of paying attention to the passing of time kept this from me.
---
Can they also stop gender locking them? I want the male mohawk for my female character.
---
Ding Ding!
---
this what i was trying to say, but i didn‘t wanna come across as some know-it-all uuuuhhh i played the previous fallouts and ya‘ll aren‘t even real fans, you know? this shit can go down south very quickly on gaming reddit. 😅 
---
but yeah, this. PA lost its purpose in this one.
---
it's only tied to where you originally placed the camp.
---
moving it after only slightly changes your spawn
---
50/50 plans and build ideas.  I’m role playing a 6 year old with my camp building skills, so looking to up my game there.  There are just some incredible camps out there.  Best ones I think are the tight and decorated builds.
---
gear tends to be secondary..  With 5 characters Im always looking for upgrades since I’ve specialized their gear a bit.  (All vanguard, all weightless, etc).  Most of what I have is 2 or non-optimal 3 stars so it’s hard to find upgrades even for sale.  Weapons I would need likely would run 20k at this point.  
---
I have most cosmetics I want, with typical exceptions.  I did find a responder police uniform which I don’t think I’ve ever seen before.  90 caps, wondering if I got a steal or ripped off.
---
&gt; The Tank Killer perk cards are a big booster here as well, and apply to both semi-auto and full-auto rifles.
---
That’s awesome to know!
---
I can’t see the pieces at all
---
I didn’t say that, it’s just annoying
---
I won't mind just being able to undersell an item to the machine. In other words, I want to trade in a 1* weapon (5 scrip) but vendor only has 4 scrip left. Let me just trade in the dumb thing. She can keep the change. I don't care.
---
Remember the drink despensers Vault tec have us in Fo4,  and how nice and relaxed it made those people who lived in your settlements, what did we spike the punch with?
---
Holy crap, I'd never noticed this lol
---
It seems different. My original CAMP device location would put me just outside my front door, but it put mt visitors in my foundation. Whoops.
---
I drug the CAMP outside, put it near my vendors. I spawn a bit further away than before, but visitors now have spawn a few "meters" North East of my spawn spot.
---
Must've worked got a few thumbs up last night, which I wouldn't be inclined to give if I got stuck in the floor heh
---
That doesn't really negate my original point though, if power armor had those traits it would be well ahead of regular armor again, and the core issue with the system is still that it doesn't really create a huge variety of builds, at best a variety of ways to reach the same place.
---
It is super frustrating that the "correct" way to play the game now is have as many level 50 alts as possible. The limit is BS.
---
That’s true and I hope they will
---
Que ? are you in the wrong forum, or did i totally miss something in Fallout 76 ? :)
---
What in the actual fuck would opening port 80 even do in this case? Is the game now an http website?
---
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise
---
My money is on these being duped items
---
Buyer beware
---
Emergency Protocold
---
Not in all cases, often times when the queen dies a female can and will take the mantel of queen, as long as she's able to reproduce with a male. We see this happen in mole rat colonies, as well as in some specific ant colonies
---
Do they even have the ability to do this? Many dupers are actively fishing for better items with their truckloads of duped ‘god tiers’, they are perfectly fine.
---
Its glitched, you can only do it once.
---
Sequence protein
---
Yeah honestly, I'm actually interested to hear what I might of missed.
---
I’ve seen this and speed demon fast reload also not working from time to time.  You’re not alone but it does seem to correct over a session (like how in FO4 if things got janky I’d zone into a cave to clear it up.
---
Let me know when you make that game.
---
That's great, but you kinda got jiffed. They should sell for 300 caps each.
---
With bear arms the most any weapon I have gets is around 4.7lbs
---
Good thing I crafted 40 of them right before the last patch
---
Some of us haven't been able to fast travel for quite some time.
---
Myself and my husband will stop by and check out someone's vending machine. If it's near the path we have to walk.
---
Do like that idea of trick or trick
---
Did you by chance use the scrapping machine at the Purveyor?
---
I just did everything the same with another alt.....only thing I did different was that I scrapped my legendaries at another scrapping location and I didn't lose my existing scrip.
---
Of course it’s glitched.
---
Is monster mash pvp and how does it work? Are you killing other players or just trying to get more candy than the other people?
---
cave crickets and level 54 gutsys are the only things that should be viewed as a threat in this game, they're crazy.
---
So basically... conan 76
---
That happened halfway through my first silo. I had to defend the officers as they prepare the launch and I just decided to launch it and leave. Its tough, I know.
---
He had a camp behind the billboard outside Flatwoods. I gotta think it was sitting right there, so he used it. Otherwise no transfer. Clever. I wish we could hang transfer boxes in our camps, but this is a clever workaround
---
Glowing mass, hardened mass, high rad fluids.  Not for “right then” use but for balancing out for people that are short on one.  Tricky to balance prices with flux and components.
---
This one might actually be useful so when they accidentally let duping in the game  the dupers arent making buttloads of rares.
---
Scrap it, learn the plan. Make more.
---
Robco. Mr. House is disappointed that you went to all that trouble and got the name wrong.
---
;-)
---
Yeh I hear you there, I hear that unique gutsy firing sound and run for cover until I can get a shot on it or atleast it location on it, they pop up anywhere.
---
Sometimes the door takes a while to load. Either wait or server hop.
---
Let that area load up and try again or server hop. This is mentioned daily
---
Ah thanks!
---
What does scrip do? I haven’t play for a month or two and just got back into the game
---
It’s one of the in-game pip boy games.
---
Shhhhh. The quad explosive railway's power is a secret. We dont want Nerfthesda hearing about it.
---
I've been dreaming about this for so long
---
Took me 3 nukes to get the wendigo.  I saw a lot of shutterbugs last queen for it too so it must be the most uncommon.
---
I'd be happy if they allowed perks to affect stash items. With the weights displayed its already halfway implemented
---
Same as most of the ones you find in the world.
---
All I hear is "git gud" in the ideal language.
---
Well, what do you call having nothing better to do than insult strangers you know ni th ing about on the internet.... oh that's right, having no life.
---
If power armour had all the legendaries that regular armour has then ofc it would be op. But I was just responding to your point that “regular armour has nothing going for it” when it completely surpasses power armour if you just spend a week or 2 scavenging through the player market a half hour a day. If I had enough points to change my special and get the perks I need to change my main power armour build to a non power armour build then I would have done it a while back.
---
Yah just echoing confirmation about this. The dailies CAN drop possum badges. I got several from them so far. I like doing them more than grinding campfire tales.
---
It used to not have a number on it, then after an update it did and the fact that its unmarked on the map...makes me very interested.
---
Add in stealth still acting up.
---
Somehow those Mutants at West-Tek can spot me up on the cliff, in chameleon, maxed stealth perks &amp; agility hiding behind rocks trying to get my HIDDEN back.
---
Then I'm stuck in DANGER until I server hop.
---
Doesnt happen everytime, but it's frequent enough for me to suspect something is wrong. Sucks on my stealth rifle build, that multiplier is a huge part of my damage output. Kind of forgot about it as I was working on my alt the past month. It's better than it was a few patches ago but I still reckon something is f-ed in the eh with the system.
---
Ts and quad do not exist together and never have.
---
aha, my bad, sorry, actually never heard about it, lol :)
---
I can help need it too xbox on now gt webfootfootball
---
Physics, yo.
---
Forgot that issue, but you’re right on that.
---
Second attempt I got a plasma pistol %#££¥€@&amp;$%
---
And I wanted one of the female looks for my male character. I don’t know why they decided to gender lock things.
---
I think its actually a type 56-4, since that rifle is vhambered in 5.56.
---
We will probably know in a few day's when the new patch is in place :)
---
Ok, so go do it.
---
Scrapping it teaches you to craft them, like the other armor set helmets. Go ahead and do that for yourself, just don't give out/sell any helmets you craft
---
yes but i am just fighting for them using a few rounds and maybe a stempack or so. the amount you put in for a shity peice in a fight isnt muh but to take 10 shitty peices u got in fights and cash them all in just ti get one or two shtty peices.
---
Or just fucking make those cards work passively
---
Don't forget the Gauss Rifle losing its charge without firing after holding and releasing the trigger...
---
Thank everyone so much for giving me clarity on this subject! ❤️👍🏼
---
Cause I don’t use the Gauss, but yeah it’s good you mentioned it. Hope Bethesda reads this.
---
Yeah, it's super annoying. Using stuff from your favorites bar is fine, but any kind of consumable from your inv has a chance of crashing your game. Food, chems, plans, all of it has crashed me...
---
Hmm..
---
Does that hurt more than an arrow to the kne ? :D
---
When you jump don’t flail around just because you’re unkillable like some cartoon character jumping out an airplane.  Focus on your landing spot.  Keep your legs tight and together.  Arms to the side.
---
Poise counts!
---
Yeah, that'll do it
---
Same issue here. Can't make those damn white russians.
---
It’s a bug report, what do you not understand?
---
I'd say the arrow because you can live getting shot in the knee with an arrow but a nuke to the face, not so sure lol
---
At most, you mean gotta mean. Even with the wooden furniture, a type 56-4 with a reflex sight and a suppresor would weigh at most 9 pounds. And M4 is even lighter cause it starts at like 6 pounds.
---
Heaviest modification you could add onto it irl would be like an m203, and even that only adds three pounds. 
---
Rifles are heavy enough after carrying them for an extended period; a conpany that makes heavy modifications and expects anyone but gear nuts to buy them is gonna be a company soon out of business.
---
Server hopping wendigo cave can give almost 1000 screws in an hour. I don’t think they are worried about farming
---
Literally only saw 12 caps each person dozens of times. Even if I had 100% kill rate ghouls would still be better to farm. So no survival for me, I'll def play if they have a reset/seasons but beth have 0 clue what to do with PvP.
---
Yeah, I don't think most PA users are trying to sneak. They just run in guns or sledgehammers blazing.
---
Yeah I love the pip-boy games, I beat Grognak and Wastelad a few days ago, they were really fun. Kinda wish you got stuff if you beat them, like atoms or whatever.
---
Lol :)
---
I’ve been playing stealth since launch (with an optional pa/heavy load out to switch to for nuke zones), and stealth seems to be becoming worse and far less effective than it was. 
---
I don’t expect to be a to just be able to walk up to enemies, but I’m being spotted from miles away with max sneak and 3 pieces of chameleon armour.  I even have everything as muffled or shadowed too lol.
---
I've been checking them with no luck.  I think I've checked 100+ of them so far.  My guess is the odds to get one are now less then 1%.  I'm 99.9% sure this is a bug and I hope it's fixed on Tuesday.
---
Upvoting for visibility.  Have commented on other threads about this issue, it's at least 2 months old now.
---
Thanks, and I hope you can get it.
---
Perhaps, but the game is still buggier than fallout 4
---
Love it.
---
Camp budget wouldn’t be bad that’s maybe make my stash storage lower tbh since most of my things are junk
---
If you need a respec at that level its quicker to make a new character and grind it to level 50+
---
Are you on Ps4?
---
Bethesda doesn't take bug reports from reddit
---
Ive had both for more than 4 months and they both survived the cleansing
---
Also Heavy weapons need their own category not connected with ranged
---
I’m on PS4 but thanks!
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
This is hilarious in how much detail they put in the opening area which you never ever see again.
---
I disagree I do think it does need to be unlimited script simply because I don’t want to wait in line behind the guy with 10,000 script. I do agree with upping the daily limit 150 is not very reasonable.
---
I beat it back in Fallout 4. IIRC there aren't more than two parts, you fight the final boss and that's it. Just make sure to fight every battle for that fat loot, and that should make you ready for the final boss.
---
Thank you for the offer!! :) I've already chased down another. We are gonna try again today!
---
I will call you comment 'A' and you are a good comment
---
No problems at all here.
---
Perma ban and take top offenders to court, the rest will vanish. Delete all the duped items, if they even capable of doing it. Nobody will stop playing just because their counterfeit toy got confiscated. People will welcome a clean environment.
---
But I will call you comment 'B' and you are a naughty comment
---
How the hell is it so high up and supported?
---
Nice try FBI...
---
No he makes [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LleeMp9aJH8) sounds.
---
The Chinese pandas should give copper because I'm 97% sure they are spy devices.
---
I should have worded it better you’re right. 
---
My point was tse combats with 8 rounds, cant compete with a quad with 8 rounds that isnt two shot. This inferred poorly that a non quad double barrel cant compete with the dps of a combat shotgun. As the reloads kills it.  I was focusing on dps.
---
Those are dogs
---
i want ammo crafting boosts in the atom store
---
But you got the achievement ! Was it your own nuke?
---
Shit you right lol
---
Man you have been visiting the wrong vending machines. Mine are full of usable 1-2* items aimed at players who have recently gotten to lvl 50 and are looking for an item that fits their build but is affordable. I have 10+ weapons / 6 armor for sale on my main and 40+ weapons / 20+ armor on my vender only character.
---
 If you want something better then you gotta talk to me because I can't sell a 8k furious swing speed switchblade with my cap issues right now.
---
I'd love an update on this also. This is something promised before the game released and after, and it is one of the main reasons for hubby and I buying the game. Private servers and modding support. I know modders are biting at the bit to want to make content and fixes for the game.
---
Last I heard from months back was just a general "sometime late in 2019" as a timeframe for it, but I've always been doubtful of that. It means cutting into their atom shop and revenue streams when we can finally have private servers, modding, and editing our own games/servers, so I am sadly not optimistic on it anytime soon.
---
Thanks for the tip! I did spot them when they did one of the later vendor tweaks a couple patches ago - but I forgot to go back and update my old post because I’ve been playing another character for a couple of weeks now.
---
the problem with the single action is that despite its higher base damage then all the other revolvers it has only two mods, making the western by default better.
---
i have a calibrated quad explosive 25% faster fire rate western which was hilarious before they "fixed" or "broke" sneak. sneak along with diminishing visual detection range, also used to diminish audio detection range. you used to be able to clear the golf club and west-tek with a revolver and never be detected.
---
 I took 5 from my patch, a few days ago. At 19 Radshields, I almost have enough. ;)
---
*insert velma saying*, "you stop that" meme
---
Rare plans and then I'll look at junk mainly Flux sometimes I'll see other things that I'll buy but if there are no plans or only a few I may not even visit.
---
Yep my own nuke, I tried to get the trophy/achie before because I thought it just meant to be in the zone but it didn't pop so I just went straight to the middle this time to take it to the face and that worked lol
---
Please tell it's powered by two fusion generators in the nacelles.
---
You mean reading challenges while listening to some molerat emerging and making an attempt
---
I actually prefer West Tek. That way I can double down and get my 1400 caps selling assault rifles or scrap the rifles for steel for my railway rifle ammo.
---
That makes it 10x better!
---
Glad I haven't done it yet! Guess I'll have to do it in one sitting
---
Yeah west tek is better for farming decent guns but if you just want legendaries to scrap then go to whitesprings.
---
You won't believe it but someone died right in front of me for seemingly no reason and I quickly revved them! After 2 days of trying... OH well, thanks for the offer anyway! :)
---
No problem!
---
Able to help too.  GT same as name here.
---
As long as you move the fast travel point to somewhere to somewhere out in the open, people can just stand and wait a few seconds for the base to load in. At least you won't be spawning in foundations that are loading around you. 
---
Of course it will be abused by people so they can trap potential visitors, which is probably why they haven't been re-added already. Maybe have it so you can only place them on terrain rather than floors or foundations.
---
And now apparently crossbow bolt climbing.
---
“Easy Women” is a phrase that needs to rot. Cool stuff otherwise.
---
For a while I thought my came crashed alot but I came to the conclusion I had crappy internet connection.
---
Yeah but it’s still cool finding rare mods like that
---
Where do they?
---
Yep! Now all I got left is mod 50 guns and read 20 mags and all the trophies should be done and would make it the second game I've platinumed
---
I have all of them but 1. If you're on xbox you can add me and I can let you borrow it until you beat it
---
That was AWESOME
---
No, and that's just RNG for you. Whatever it seems, it's just RNG. You farm enough (like I do) and sooner or later you get the same shit again. Especially one stars.
---
The ultimate sucker punch
---
It's just a receiver swap, you should be able to keep using 308. And by how they 'balance' weapons in the past, the 5mm receiver will probably do way less damage.
---
I think you can place small letters and write stuff yourself. Bit of a hassle, though
---
Thank you. Thought I was going crazy.
---
They probably just dont want the vendor to be additional storage space 
---
Like, if it were separate weight you could shove more crap in there at ridiculous prices to hoard more stuff
---
That problem used to be fixed but now it's back
---
Every time I fast travel to a player camp, I am usually able to move before their base spawns in. I usually run clear of where I spawned in from about 10 steps or so to keep from spawning into a wall or licked area etc. It’s a pain for sure.
---
I'm with you.
---
Yeah, I sell my leftovers for 100 caps and they seem to sell for that price.
---
For real tho
---
Got you in through the doors though huh
---
I'm mostly looking for doors that aren't locked so I can see the interior decorating. I'm still amazed that most people lock their doors even after the patch made it so players can't destroy camps. Not to mention about a third of the time when I fast travel to a camp, I'm placed inside and find all the doors are locked.
---
Otherwise I'm looking for plans and the hopeful to find cheap flux.
---
On top of 762 ammo yield, please please make more skins for heavy weapons including the LMG, gatling, mini and 50 cal. Even just the lazy gold and silver are better than the default skins.
---
Campfire tales
---
Exactly
---
There is no night in this game, everywhere is so bright all the time, only difference is the background.
---
Not just whitesprings, I've had it happen at other places.
---
I laughed at it.
---
Yeah I had issues with connection at my last apartment, but I have the best Xfinity package available so that isn’t the issue.
---
I love the toads in a bottle, but it didn't pop on my Tadpole to-do list, which was the last thing I needed. Anyone else have this problem with the frog habitat quest? I've but half a dozen of them and it still hasn't registered as complete. 😤
---
Stink bomb should give a 5min debuff that causes a players in a 10m radius to make gagging noises. And if they don't get out of the AoE in, say 3s, they vomit and pass out.
---
What the hell happened to fallout?
---
Find the lookout tower just to the ENE of Vault 76.  Climb it, and look around.  It will put more points of interest on your map.  Could have sworn there was one due south of the vault as well, but cant find it on the map.
---
Can anyone make me one on Ps4
---
This...
---
I’m simultaneously the first and last person.
---
I pick up and sell random stuff for cheap that may be tedious for more casual players to get (anything bulk, uncommon outfits). 
---
But I also use it for a storage bank safe from scrapping. I’m not trying to “rip you off” with my 100 cap pristine teddy bears or 1000 cap preserved pies. In fact I don’t give a shit about you at all. I’m storing them until display cases come out.
---
What system you on. I can give you one if your on ps4
---
Great idea, atm there’s a post it note stuck to the tv lol
---
I want to see more pipboy games
---
Easiest way ive found is to kill one or two enemies then use a repair kit. Did the repair challenge in like 2 mins doing this.
---
Lol I have Xfinity too...I can pretty much guarantee I'll drop internet several times during peak use hours...Xfinity infrastructure sucks. I'm not saying that's the case for you just what I found after digging in....do you use their router?
---
Found them yesterday. They are still there.
---
I think your right about keeping the limit but it should be upped to something divisible by 40, as the most you can currently gain from grinding an item is 40 the total scrip you get per day should be cleanly divisible by 40.  160 or 200 would be reasonable I think.  
---
That lets you grind 4 or 5 3 star weapons.  150 lets you grind 3 and 3\4 so a bump of 10 minimum is needed, a bump of 50 would be better and make it so you can get the limit in 5 days exactly.  It's a small and I think reasonable QoL change
---
This needs more attention.
---
I have over 300 candy sitting in my stash. Everyone who visits will get one. I'm ready!!
---
What's your luck stat?
---
Too easy to grief if they just do the Fallout 4 version. To work in 76, fast travel targets would need the following requirements:
---
* Must be placed directly on the ground.  
---
* Must be at least 6 feet from any other object.  
---
* Must only have one per camp.
---
That, I could see working.
---
fo4 wasn't fixed by Bethesda. modders patched out the bugs.
---
It's not meant to be a system of infinite Legendary rolls ...
---
The only priority fix they do is when a bug benefits the player
---
This happens to me with everything, not just SBQ... but for me they are all completely invisible. Can't tell you how many times Whitespring bots have saved my ass from invisible nonsense.
---
You can get the blueprints from the terminal were you finish the quest Belly of the Beast.
---
Bloody gatling gun. Pew pew pew and it's dead
---
Oh yeah what you described would be spot on
---
This game succeeds in not not failing to surprise you?
---
Came here to say clipping. Just look at the backpack from Creation Club in Fallout 4. It starts with straps, and they clip the vanilla vault suit, as soo. As I can I remove those straps. The clipping drives me crazy.
---
water filters need to be buffed up 
---
I mean come on 
---
having to go though all that bullshit  
---
to get a one use crap filter  ?
---
a sock or towel   can be used  to  filter water         
---
still have to  boil it 
---
but its the fallout particles that have rads
---
I also want the hanging bats and wall decorations you see around.
---
Vault tech: “oh we hope that vault 76 can re build society”
---
Vault 76: let’s go trick or treating!
---
The most issues I’ve had with them at this place the last few months is a slow down, not really a drop off. But I do know all too well of the issues with Comcast’s infrastructure lol. We do use their router. I found that resetting my system helps with the crashing for a day or so, then it randomly starts again. I haven’t tried resetting the router yet.
---
That is amazing, what are you on?
---
Only use PA in nuke zones. Other then that all stealth sniper. All you need is the right perks and armor.
---
Kind of a self defeating argument there. Why should the easy to acquire ones be as good as the ones you killed a 3* enemy for?
---
Are harpoon guns good
---
Halloween quest would be cool
---
15
---
Turned into MMO you should try it.
---
I do this! And then my husband wonders why I have so much more stash space available than he does!
---
Pioneer scouts
---
My favorite thing about junk is how all the toys contain lead lol
---
Ingredients:  1 corn, 1 holio
---
I heard that in their voice.
---
Anddddd that’s why you aren’t a dev
---
I do play it but wtf is this kiddie cutesy Halloween bullshit.
---
Similar experience... after the nuke I saw two players, one jumping up and down and using a jet pack boost for a second, land and repeats... another near him looks like he was running in place. However their GT’s showed them at the fissure. 
---
Two of my team were actively fighting the queen and one said he was right next to me... only thing next to me was a scorch...lol
---
There was a ton of normally spawned creatures and we killed the SBQ, then every single meat pile other than the queen simply disappeared. She also stayed in the ground not moving but we killed her.
---
For a good 5 minutes + not even a single scorch then a few came back but that was it. 
---
Heading to the sunken rail yard, I see a glowing Yao Guai... I kill it and take a pic for the challenge and screen says 3 Yao Guai... ??? I look and sure enough 2 more spawned in, not moving and you could shoot at them, lower their health to almost 0 and it would then reset. 
---
They didn’t attack at all... another bear appeared in one of the train cars again not moving. 
---
Going into the high school all of us saw the mutant hounds there doing the same thing. 
---
Not sure what happened, just all weird...
---
I didn't think you could have "floating" elements not accessible by stairs... sounds like a glitch. I'm not familar with one that does that, but with so many, who can keep up?  ;\^)
---
Happen to grab a screenshot or video? Posting it has a decent chance for somebody from Besthesda to see it; Might might it easier for them to know what's broken.
---
Trust me, that’s far from the worst!!
---
No it’s good for legendary effects but the gun is useless
---
It doesn’t even work in a dark cave so night time is irrelevant
---
Why would you want an explosive anything? They were nerfed into unplayability.
---
Don’t forget the White Knight perk card from the agility tree for cheaper armor repair and slower damage rates to add to the savings. (4 levels)
---
There’s also two nifty perk cards under Luck for weapons and armor to self-repair during combat, also multi-level.
---
PC :(
---
What platform are you on?
---
Well they’ll probably do events for Holidays?
---
Way too far and showing no interest in fixing their game breaker.
---
It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, the stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
---
Darn. I have like 20 of then on ps4
---
You just don’t know how to use them, they’re not meant to one hit kill anything, but they are perfect for crippling enemies.
---
because the scrip im using (to get this “easily aquired” weapon) wasnt  easily aquired. i had to fight 3* enemies to get the shitty legendaries that i used ti get the scrip that i use to get this “easily aquired” gun
---
Challenges...  there are a lot of challenges like learn different weapon plans. Well unless you randomly find them you’ll need to buy them to complete this.
---
So a quest random plan award....??? lol
---
You can get it from the tadpole vending machine
---
Because you can't build robots out of chocolate.
---
I think you buy it from one of the scout vending machines using badges, I think it’s the tadpole machine but check the possom machine too just in case
---
If you have bunker access they usually spawn in one of the lockers, I think in the medical wing or science wing.
---
And it’s dirt cheap. Just one tadpole badge I believe
---
I actually saw your previous post and thought it was a cool idea. 
---
I am a woman, and found this second one unfortunate. 🤷‍♀️ Can’t really stop men from using misogynistic phrases, but I can point them out.
---
At least you wait! My husband leaves me behind while I collect everything. So I get where he's coming from...
---
I nearly spit my coffee reading that last line
---
Now I gotta go do Monster Mash a bunch of times and save the candy for this
---
They're considered one of the best. I have a buddy that would buy that from you on PS4. Lemme ask him about it
---
I do go out of my way to buy them as well, if not for the challenges but to satisy the completionist side of me.
---
I'll give you 10k right now for that hunk of junk.
---
Thats the point though, players will have to visit the game daily to get their script allotment, keeping player traffic steady, increasing the odds you might buy something in the atomic shop. Its a psuedo Mobile Model.
---
My username is thescorchbeast but I might not sell it as I’ve just used it and it one shot a lvl 62 ghoul
---
Again, which shouldn't be the case as you lost all learned plans, all challenges, and all completed quests.
---
I'll try that out. Currently I'm trying out an AA LAR and it's okay.
---
Ok, thanks! Got it! It looks pretty nice in my house. :)
---
Ow yea might be a good idea to mention that indeed lol. I'm on PC
---
Cant exactly blame just the duplicators alone with bethesda's poor work that went into this game,
---
still the dupers are a massive issue to this game,  but not the only reason why this game is falling apart
---
Exploding harpoon guns are sweet...and have recoverable ammo. That's a good gun for a heavy weapons build. With the weight reduction my rifleman would carry that for fun!
---
I'll add you maybe we can make a deal I have many trades.
---
Thank you and you're welcome
---
Like
---
One of the community managers said they were working on it but I do not recall seeing an official patch yet.
---
Ok I just used it and I love it. It one shot a lvl 62 ghoul
---
A responsible home owner is a joy to any neighborhood.  ;\^)
---
It's not something you should *have* to worry about, honestly, but it's nice that you do. I would think it would be a simple-ish fix. They could:
---
* Check the structure for players and teleport them to a safe place with a message indicating why.
---
* Uglier, but maybe simpler, would be to check the entire build area for players and do an auto-fast travel to the same location without the camp.
---
* Even simpler would be persisting the camp for, say, thirty seconds after player log out. A message and countdown would warn all players in the build area that the camp is going bye-bye and that they should get someplace safe.
---
Lots of potential options that wouldn't cause honest people to second guess their build choices.
---
I really like that build. Thank you so much for your help. I think I have never been comfortable being such a glass cannon that I always feel I need those DR boosts. But I totally get what you're saying about the point being to oneshot everything. 
---
What do you use to pin your health and manage?
---
Sounds like a error display bug, should say stash limit reached (or something along those lines) items in fermenter are added to stash, not part of workshop budget
---
I appreciate the effort going into this post, but I just have to say that personally I really dislike all of these ideas.
---
You sure? I moved it one day to test &amp; it dropped me off a cliff I'm built near. Didn't relocate the whole CAMP area, just the device.
---
I'm tempted to do some testing, but I'm guessing others already have?
---
If you’ve done the BOS quest, did you get the plans for the BOS sniper rifle? It’s pretty awesome!
---
To bad I'm from Belgium but I'm on ps4... Would've been perfect otherwise
---
I’m in the same boat. Have you gone to some places like grafton station to buy all the plans there? Or all the enclave bunker plans? I’ve been needing someplace to sink all my caps as well and easily put 17k caps in at grafton. I thought I had them all but the boy there sells a lot
---
What platform are you on?  There's a way to do this on XBox.  I have heard that there's a way on PS4 too although I don't own one so I don't know for sure.
---
But if the server itself crashes, you're SOL.
---
Yeah you've got it wrong man.
---
Harpoon Gun- people want. 
---
Suppressors- not good
---
Explosive- Amazing!
---
Reduced weight- On a heavy weapon, that's an amazing 3rd perk.
---
Its not  a dev room only item. I wish that myth would die. It’s rare but it does drop in the normal game
---
Proof: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/FPABWb5
---
I revived a guy that was not on a team with me and got some quest accomplishment.. But have just started the scouts so now im wondering if ill have to get lucky a second time? 😔
---
Sould note that i was and am a low lvl and just got stomped in grafton. Some 50 somthing was near by and came to help but he got wrecked by his own nade i think. I just ran up and gave him a stim then followed him around (just in case) and he finished up the place. Not sure if this is the thing i keep seeing posted here.
---
You know I’m playing a Raider right? My tongue is placed firmly in my cheek.
---
They're very likely to spawn at the BoS graveyard outside of Huntersville as well, but sometimes they do sometimes they don't, and the last ones I saw were level 50 &amp; glowing, probably hard to one hit them with a knife unless already a melee build.
---
Lake where the swim test was or when the Wolf event starts.
---
How’d you get the flat roof on the outside like a porch cover? Mine only want to place inside the building and I had to resort to just using second story floors.
---
what is your current build
---
And beards.
---
Thats odd. Neither is full...
---
Pa dose not really require any perks to run. And it is a good middle ground if ypu don't have good normal armor, which dose take quite a few perks to run
---
Xbox..but thanks for the offer!
---
Most underrated response in this thread
---
Ah yea that's a shame. Thanks tho :)
---
Found one from a dude that claimed to have data mined it. Perforating was 40%, stinging was 20%. Thank you!
---
if youll die in a puddle for me ill be your friend.. lol
---
I do a lot of this already. Maxed out Light Frame, Travelling Pharmacy, PackRat, Str 13, my Agi is like 9.
---
My End is only like 6 though lol
---
Usually I find a discreet place and drop just enough to get underweight and ft to the nearest stash/vendor and sell/store enough to go back and nab it
---
That would leave the gun with the same exact problem it has now though...
---
There are only two viable full auto ballistic heavy gun ammo types, 5mm and .50 cal.
---
I just recently got a very nice explosive minigun and I'm **constantly** farming ammo, even with the massive amount of ammo you can craft for it compared to the LMG. I can't imagine how much more farming the LMG takes... I lied, I can I have two nice LMG's but I don't farm mats for their ammo simply because it's a waste of resources. I'll passively collect .308 and use it when I've got 1-2k sitting around.
---
Good Luck in finding a teammate
---
The only perk you'll really need is Power User to help conserve fusion cores.
---
good joke bro,  those dupers got banned,  and we still getting "disconnected from server"  and other errors that  seem to still be there despite the big bad dupers being erased
---
not defending the dupers in any way but funny how fast people are to shill for bethesda and only blame dupers, yes dupers do contaminate this game by flooding otherwise Rare items into the market, i can agree on this part but dupers are not the only issue plaguing this game its the crybabies who complain about pvp and ruin the other good things in the game,  pvp is trash,  game is trash,  the community? beyond toxic kind of ironic seeing how fallout is based around nuclear war.
---
Yeah it’s gonna be a great time and a good resume builder for the future. Hopefully I won’t get too injured :)
---
So taking what your designing is nothing more than a fallout clone of pubg or fortnight.
---
Here is a suggestion for you. Go become a modders and lrn to code and make a mod for those games. And play them.
---
Yes fo76 has issues and yes some bugs have come back. But be honnest even if none of the bugs came back and dupping never happened you would still be here whining about something else. The game is playable in it's current iteration and most folks won't see the issues that are committed on this sub . And if they do come across one they will keep playing.
---
TLDR: Stop trying to make 76 a clone of something else. If your so hot for this or that game go play it.
---
It's spotty as hell. Just did West-Tek run &amp; the more or less ignored me full on except for one spotted me (more like it just chose to tell him where I was).
---
Its...I dunno...even when HIDDEN you can tell they're looking right at you, and the game is just sending bullets in random directions to make it seem like they're looking. It get that they're shooting with hopes of hitting, like lighting up the Jungle in 'Nam, but when those beady eyes are staring _right at your soul_ it's a bit like "suuure you don't see me"
---
what console
---
Haha. Well it so happens I also still need that done :p
---
Burrows can be decent if nuked.... I like the whole area around Harper's ferry as its fairly Target rich.
---
Granted my i.o.u. beer is 25k caps but it makes everyone grin when they see it
---
I have a psuedo treat box. My camp is near an Aid box and an Ammo box, I have signs up for people to leave their spare aid/ammo and take what they need.
---
I didn't think people would do it but they have and it makes me happy.
---
Ok bud. 👍
---
It may seem like they’ve handcuffed us, but let’s admit most of us are packrats and will almost always be maxed out for space.
---
One thought I have after spending the last few days adding 2 vending machines to my base, is look around your base for duplicate items that you might be able to scrap to free up budget room.
---
I have 4-5 teammates and had set the base up with extra copies of stashes, crafting stations, 6-7 musical instruments, a lot of lights and a good sized indoor farm.
---
I ditched half my crops (I can compensate with Green Thumb perk) scrapped some extra stashes and some extra lights and bingo I had plenty of room to fill up two vending  machines.
---
Also, I took some weapons from stash and carried them on my character until I can sell down some weight, and it seems to be working.
---
You may want any to not be in survival unless you can pvp and then don’t attack back in adventure. Survival is about pvp and if you don’t attack in adventure they cant hurt you.
---
I would like to see a reply from Beth as to why they won't give us the fast travel mats. This has been asked for since shortly after the beta when we realized they had been removed, and they have not given a response as to why they were taken out or why they can't give them back to us. With player vending they have become a necessity, not a luxury item. I want players to spawn right in my vending area facing the machines.     
---
I have seen players who argue that some will use them for traps, so only allow them on the adventure side and a trap won't matter other then the wasted caps travelling to it.
---
I've heard people having issues getting the achievement if they are using their character from the beta. The only way to get it was to start a new character. 
---
Are you using a beta character?
---
No because I server hopped and had to quit out of the game, thus resetting the plauers on the Social tab.
---
Fusion cores are easy enough to Come by and last long enough without it imo
---
What's the first?
---
Nope... started playing a couple weeks after launch
---
Monster mash is sort of pvp but I've NEVER had anyone else their when doing it so it just killing ghouls in that case.
---
I rock a swimsuit with the Monster mask while wearing a backpack and seeing no straps...... D:
---
I build a shopping mall and had to down size to free up space. I just wish I could utilize all the budget and still sell stuff
---
Holy fuck, people are still playing this garbage?
---
I'm not in survival its adventure
---
I was a wastelander like you, but thenb I took a nuke to the face
---
Huh mine weighs around 3 pounds hmm..... I've been noticing a lot of odd weight issues in game lately. I'll log out with 200lbs on me and then log back in with 195lbs.... ok lol.
---
It’s fixed thank you
---
I should go Enclave to be fair, I know MODUS often sells the Gauss plans which I think I haven't learnt yet. Wish there were more fun things to spend on though, crafting guns is only really worth it if you're after mods or trying to burn through your crafting materials lol
---
yup, if we get an advantage from a bug it's gone by the end of the week.     
---
if it makes the game more grindy then it's a feature and left alone.
---
How many times I tried to jump and instead pulled another fucking wire
---
Well, shit. I never noticed that little guy. Thanks!
---
all i want is Halloween PA's; headless horseman, Grim Reaper, The Devil and Ghost, maybe even a Frankenstein paint that can only be applied if you have each piece from a different set on one frame
---
Teenagers: Mr Johnson gave crappy candy, let’s egg his house!
---
Vault 76 residents: SwagDaddy62 gave crappy candy, let’s nuke his house!
---
VATS is the best way to deal with the "slidie Bois".
---
Oh yah claiming workshops are also asking for pvp so that’s still an aspect for those. I server hop if someone far outclasses me in workshop pvp and try again but I loose 200 caps a death from players almost.
---
Stealth sniper
---
If we can't go trick or treating, can we really call it society?
---
I have a lv200+ non-PA and PA toons both. If you are planning to use your T-60 here and there when and if needed you are completely fine with not having any related perks, but be prepared that your cores will burn quite fast (especially if running alot, using melee power attacks etc). If you are planning to use your PA 24/7 thought.. I highly recommend of getting the related perks. Without them your gameplay will turn into junk/core harvesting one, because of high use of cores and expensive repair costs (which you will do alot without perks).
---
.50 cal:
---
Deployable MOD - deploys tri-pod mount/power armor locks in place preventing movement, increased RoF/accuracy.
---
Belt-feed mod - magazine becomes "bottomless" weapon can overheat causing increased durability loss until cooled.
---
Jacketed barrel MOD - increased RoF, weapon takes longer to overheat.
---
Baked in mods?
---
more gore than cutesy hopefully
---
Finally got my cannibal perk, may come later! &gt;:)
---
You got incredibly lucky. Serum plans used to be that price range before they removed them from the Queen's loot pool. Since then it's rare to find them for much less than the vendor bot prices.
---
IF they could figure out the punch bowl and fix it, they could make it hold candy for Halloween
---
Yeah I've got a 3 star troubleshooters/explosive lmg I use to run silo's with. It's great... for 3-4 minutes, then I run out of ammo. Then it's back to my minigun and .50 cal. I keep a gatling gun around in case I get low on ammo. No other full auto heavy weapon is as efficient in ammo costs. Harpoon gun with flechette is nice and gives a lot of ammo back but I can't get a good one.
---
I've got a 3 star bloodied .50 cal and gatling laser, 3 star junkies/explosive minigun, a 2 star aa gatling gun, a 3 star zealots gatling plasma for SBQ. Then a 2 star furious LMG, a 3 star troubleshooters/explosive LMG, and a crazy explosive cryolator. Lots of nice heavy weapons, none of them the ones I really want.
---
Yeah I just really didn't want to give in and we did it for waste oil so we could sell stuff like that to other early game players like ourself
---
If you're on PC and want to learn to craft them, I'll five you one to scrap. It's a 100% chance to learn on scrapping.
---
Lol! Why do they call people bucket heads? Are they even referring to humans? Cuz they will also say “I CAN SMELL YOU HUMAN” and I just want to know where Bucket head came from lmao
---
Preston is in the game now. Sending you to defend others settlements for hardly can be called anything but a reward
---
1. Where you in Survival Mode and not adventure mode? 
---
2. Did you turn pacifist mode on after lvl 5? 
---
3. Did you fire back at him? 
---
4. Do you have things locked at your camp and he picked the lock and your turrets turned on him? 
---
Tips: 
---
Make sure pacifist mode in on under settings/game. 
---
Don’t shoot at or slap or hit other players or be on a team in which one of your team does or you’ll all be victims. 
---
Learn to block for session! Also block via console! 
---
Learn to server hop quickly! 
---
Report function for bad stuff is at bottom of selection when you hover over players icon on map. 
---
Just a few ideas...
---
No. One week and everyone will be running with ultra OP weapons.
---
Lady Janet's Soft Serve North West part of the map. Walk past the flipped bus, its a random event so you might have to hop servers.
---
Yes! We’ll wear any crazy costume ideas and decorate our bases with spooky stuff and then we’ll meet up at watoga high for a game of monster mash
---
If I cant put a bowler hat on the Mr Handy like in FO4, its worthless.
---
&gt; the damage is lacking
---
??? That's literally one of the highest dps weapons in the game... You're bad at math sir/ma'am.
---
People need to come to the realization that you’re probably not going to get the item you have been wanting.  So play the system!  Sell all your unwanted legendaries in your shop.  Don’t be greedy or else your stuff won’t sell.  Once you have 10-15k caps saved up then find the item you want through the reddit auctions because chances are someone out there got the item you want and it’s worthless to them.  Problem solved.  There is nothing wrong with the current system.  I just got a 2 shot explosive lever yesterday with this method and couldn’t be happier.  Paid 8K for it.
---
Fair enough lol
---
250000 scrip.....maybe.
---
Take my money 💷
---
ok.. I need to do it in water tho for swimming
---
So? What's wrong with that? Everyone will have OP weapons eventually.
---
does not need to be a teammate, i completed it during awol armaments when a stranger when down.
---
I wish this helmet was n the game and I wish all helmets with lights n them like this worked and replaced the pip-boy light.
---
For a mod not a plan?
---
I'm on madigans trail atm
---
Do you mean the workshops? You lose it when you log off.
---
But what you build using your CAMP will stay. If your spot is taken on the server you are notified and can connect to a different server.
---
You are my White Knight. Thanks for the help vault dweller 👌
---
Yeah- and it keep producing resources while you’re away. So if you capture a fusion core processsor and log off for 24 hours, you’ll have 192 fusion cores waiting for you when you log back in. Oh wait- that’s absurd ;)
---
I'm a build of every kind but not focused on one thing. I'm more like a pack rat who carries stuff.
---
Thanks man, but yeah he was attacking my workshop so and I don't even know there was a pacifist mode or server hoping, thanks.
---
It should be ultra expensive the hand pick every aspect of your gear in an mmo; in my opinion at least.
---
Also that expense must only be earned in game...
---
Same! Haha! I’ve bought plans I’ll never use! lol
---
Damn and I thought I was mr extra ammo with ~10-12k 5mm and 5-8k .50 cal.
---
Shut up
---
No. Simple answer.
---
They don't know if a particular weapon in your inventory is a duped one or not. Only stacks of a weapon get deleted and only down to one. They don't take away people's weapons because it's a dupe.
---
[deleted]
---
With all the residents of the area limited to one vaults worth of survivors (all of whom have their own camp modules) I’m not entirely sure who’s paying rent to live there. Do the Whitesprings bots pay rent to live/sell there?
---
That's my point, if it was a high price, could we just buy a one time use mod. It would still takes ages but at least it would be guarenteed and I would feel like I'm actually progressing towards something.
---
I gave up fighting diseases seems like my character just sees a enemy and catches a disease
---
Mmeh. Just get 5 pieces of -20% weapon weight and it'll weigh 0 pounds :-)
---
Sometimes it's more enjoyable that way. I had no idea what I was doing with my main, kind of a crafty-stealth-rifle build. Definitely had to do some adjustments after hitting 50 &amp; figuring out what I was after, but she doesn't really fall under any strict build guidelines &amp; certainly isn't min-max.
---
Second I was after a bloodied unyielding melee just to see how high I can get the damage output. Both are enjoyable but I'm more attached to the main for the choas provided by the build. Only concern with the melee character is make sure to hit first! Haha
---
It already is Punch Out. The only viable builds anymore are melee. Which is why the game is dying.
---
Did they have custom names? I’ve seen named stuff vanish till I went to the bench and fixed it.
---
Are you still around? I've tried over 20 servers today
---
Mine too
---
This is just a wild guess but maybe at E3 next month.
---
Oh boy, you really got me.
---
At the end and you have your military ID, go to terminal outside of fort defiance attached to the pole to the right of the door as you’re looking at it. 
---
There you can download the plan for the BOS sniper rifle that’s already upgraded. You can build all levels from 1-50. 
---
You may want to check to see if it’s there now, requirement is that you have military ID so maybe you could get it early. 
---
The plan is a download plan per player, not one you can give away. 
---
It’s a really good rifle though...
---
Pipe pistols too. And two in a row for me might i add. Feels like a face slap.
---
so high perception and agility. how high is your strength and intelligence
---
They’re actually SAR3s made by the angry beavers at  Century Arms.  You can tell by the fit and finish. Anyone?
---
Made a post about this. Am I wrong or was this mechanic not even mentioned to us?
---
Dont think I have seen mention of it anywhere
---
It's really hard to build a character who can carry stuff and have a build for one purpose. I never had so many stimpaks before until player vending came out. I just buy the super cheap ones and dilute them. I'm up to 800.
---
Coincidentally all my friends also stopped playing. There isn't really an endgame, and the SBQ is both boring and pointless. I spend my time using non legendary weapons and armor, hunting big game. It's something to pass the time. I'm on my fifth character now, and already lvl 56 again. My advice is to try using only non legendary items, and using endurance perks more. It makes it challenging to live off the land, and I spend less time grinding since I'm not using legendaries. It's not perfect at all, but it's something to keep me entertained.
---
Keyword - workshop... you guys took a workshop and the screen literally says you open yourself up to PvP when you do. 
---
So the player fighting you was within bounds of the game and Bethesda warned you if you try and defend it. 
---
Sorry for the bad news here... 
---
If you’re outside the circle of the workshop you can also just leave and not have to do PvP.
---
More than one can be trouble.  Chain staggers hurt....
---
Hopefully borderlands 1 or 2. God those were easy
---
I'm on PC and the server didn't crash it was just my game being stupid when I fast traveled.
---
Yeah it would really help with the "I am in the middle of nowhere, and cannot fast travel due to many weapons on me.", you could either summon your stash to store them, or summon a weapon bench to scrap them.
---
I'm not sure I see why server stress should be causing a blanket reduction in frame rate.
---
Do you want me to add it to the list, because I can add it to the list!
---
Was never a platinum person myself, but remember all my friends completing borderlands 2 for a platinum.
---
Man.                        Brutal
---
Yeah handmades would be very thin stamped sheet metal riveted together.    Very light.
---
I wasn’t saying anything other than I don’t value your opinion
---
I think with the purveyour and vending everyone will have the three star gear they want in fairly short order...then Bethesda will unlock the other stars.
---
6 and 7. Int was 4 but I moved some from charisma over so I could use lvl 3 hacker
---
Pretty sure that's what makes it special. That and it only drops at lvl 25
---
Ha, duping already did that a week after launch.
---
Speaking of 80s-90s movie references, I named my 44 "Make my day, punk."
---
I just don’t value your opinion
---
I just play till I no longer want to play the game. I have maybe 2 plats. So close on every far cry game just got tired of playing them. If you look at my trophies on ps4 I’m high level because I play a lot of games but I’m all over the board, some games no trophies some a lot. If it happens it happens
---
Goddamnit, Todd...
---
I'm sorry I disappointed you, But that you for letting me know so I know the correct spelling for future! :)
---
Hey you. You're finally awake.
---
Yeah, I know it's special, but I've seen images of it before, and it actually shows that it's legendary, with the star after its name on the top of the screen, but mine doesnt, so that's what I'm confused about
---
I only plan on using PA in nuke zones and maybe silo runs
---
Could have used a heads up at least. A budget expansion or a set aside for vended items if they won't change this.
---
Our characters have the knowledge to build vast armouries but the idea of creating an unbroken window is waaay out there hahah
---
Try the PvP in Ark, it'll become your new worst lmao
---
Power armor builds have had the upper hand for ages, and this whole "spend two weeks trading on the player market" thing is in no way something more casual players get into in a game like this.
---
Ironically, the Prime LMG is much more ammo efficient.
---
All they really need to do is increase the number of 308. rounds you craft at a time the same as it's Ultracite counterpart.
---
Math isn't an opinion lol.
---
J got stuck on danger by a ghoul in WS who was two rooms away, and only that ghoul took sneak damage. The rest acted as regular damage, which sucks because I'm very much a glass cannon in this build. Also I love being in a tree at midnight, not moving in chameleon, and a random scorched spots me from a mile away, alerting the entire hemisphere
---
Input then.
---
Nope. Should be under explosive ammo at a tinker work bench.
---
Depends on the server for me. I had one yesterday where even non-legendary enemies were dropping legendaries.
---
It is conjecture on both sides.  We simply don't have enough information to know if Appaalchia was saved and is thriving as a relatively safer area, or if the auto silos scorched the entire reason after killing off the SBs.  We do know they are dead though or FO3 would've looked way different.
---
This happens.
---
Some servers are bugged.  I just completed a WhiteSprings run ... whole golf course and road around it .... ZERO legendaries ....
---
Some servers are blessed and others are cursed.  The RNG mechanisms for the game and its servers are not as "random" as the seem, but the algorithms Bethesda is using to run them so that it creates a bit of an addictive quality to the game,don't always function as Bethesda intends.
---
in reality all you will need to use it effectively is power patcher(cheaper repair/break slower) full charge (less/no extra fc drain while sprinting power smith (to do with crafting and modding it) power user (increase fusion core time) and fix it good of course which you probably already have
---
Serve is trying to load multiple large inventory’s. Put two player with 1600 pound inventory close  to each other and you’ll notice a dramatic drop in frame rate. The game in trying to load the inventory and run the game at the same time.  It’s not designed to have players with massive inventory.
---
I agree, nothing I've stated suggests that.
---
What you mean to say is you don't like to be wrong, especially when someone points it out.
---
"Hot servers" are definitely a thing.
---
Wait for Bethesda
---
okay downvote me for stating an annoying bug. 
---
bethesda, call your shills back.
---
I got one from shooting one the other day.  I don't think that's how pathogens are supposed to work.
---
It’s cool, but what was the building mechanics stopping you from doing?
---
It’s very buggy, a couple of times i did everything quickly yet it still said i failed the event, haven’t done it since. Boss is always low level also, like most events.
---
That’s fine! I do too, so that should kill two birds with one stone.
---
I can only make missiles and 40mm grenades
---
Yes, sorry. Poor choice of words
---
Same here.  Are there any vendors who sell them?  Failing that, maybe some player vendors who can craft one with regular durability will see an opportunity here...
---
I want the blackbird skin....missed it the first time
---
I stated my opinion and you thought I was making an absolute statement. That’s the only thing. I just don’t care  about the fact you tried to make my opinion useless. That’s what I meant by Shut up
---
I'd guess height limits
---
no u.
---
Then you really don't need any other perks than MAYBE power user, and thats a big maybe.
---
That does work but it’s a tad fucked that if I remove something to relist I have to delete camp items to put it back in.  If it was in I had the budget, when it comes out I should have the budget to put it back.
---
Killing people is wrong.  Mostly.
---
95% was wall and floor placement. I'd either have to place temporary walls that I'd later delete to get one I actually wanted. And using half or single panel floors when a regular one would be "floating" or "intersecting".
---
It's part of the game, so it's not wrong,just kinda douchey.
---
Can we have a sign-in book as well? It could keep track of people who visit your camp, then maybe have a ranking system that would pop up on your CAMP stats. Let people rank your camp and then people can see who the better vendors are. 1star 2star 3star.... just a thought.
---
not really but depending on the person you ask
---
Hey I'll take one if you're game!
---
I love this game. But if they don’t go big for Halloween like this I will seriously consider finding something else to spend my time on.
---
Page not found
---
the answer to your question is stated above: sellers can make more money more immediately by selling bunches of lowball serums to players rather than a few at a time to robot vendors. the handful of sellers i interacted with on the marketplace didn’t seem to mind that people were going to resell.
---
looks like more people are chiming in that this bothers them though, so point taken.
---
Your proof is invalid...Quite literally, the link is dead.
---
We harvest enough glass one would think we could fix windows since we can create and build fish filled glass lamps...lol
---
I don’t mind one or two... but man...lol
---
Suppressor is decent right it reduces damage taken
---
If you don’t like it, don’t participate. It’s that simple. No need to rain on everyone else’s parade.
---
They do actually have a lot of statistical info. They're in the challenge menu.
---
ok. noted.
---
really thought i was doing something people were ok with, wasn’t trying to screw anyone.
---
That’s true. Maybe hit the production wing and pick up a lot of the power armor plans. Even if you don’t craft the mods yourself, you could do it for others for some caps.
---
Honestly, what I like doing is being a shopkeeper, that’s my real endgame. And the reason why I buy all the plans. I like giving back to others, be it new players or mid/high level players. I like crafting weapons and armor for lower level ones for free or dirt cheap. Or trading legendaries with mid/high level players and giving them plans they haven’t found yet. Hell, sometimes I’ll even buy plans at full price from vendors like graham (ex. mirror balls, fusion generators, advanced power connectors, etc.) just to sell them low level players for like 25 caps. Why? Cause I don’t need the caps or the mats and like giving back. My motto since launch has been be the friendly NPC that Bethesda didn’t give us.
---
The diseased tag supersedes the legendary tag without stars.
---
I'm in Flatwoods right now.. Rampance FriendZed
---
Do you have the materials for it?
---
Yep, definitely.
---
noted, thanks for weighing in.
---
Store it, then replace it, maybe. Worst case scrap and replace.
---
I got this message if I tried to put prewar booze it the fermenter. I dont on the stuff I craft.
---
I see, you did well to get around it all!
---
How did they fix it? Just I’ve had 2 replies from my ticket but nothing saying how it’s going to be fixed. Just say look at the forums for updates. I’ve seen lots of posts saying the same issue but nowhere does it says how it was fixed. Can you help please, it’s been over 48 hours.
---
Maybe it's the server? I never have issues like these.
---
Whitesprings and Westek
---
Lol what? **You** said the damage is bad. It's quite literally one of the strongest damage weapons in the game. No amount of your opinion and bullshit is going to change facts. 
---
The damage isn't lacking, end of story. Your opinion isn't a factor in the statement you made. If you wanted to state your opinion you could have left it at I don't like it. I didn't attack your opinion I corrected the premise of your opinion.
---
TL;DR: Don't state something like a fact and try to pass it off as opinion.
---
Just start the encrypted event. No shortage of downed people there.
---
I can see that.
---
I said it didn’t have enough damage so it’s useless to ME. It might be good for other builds but not for me. That an opinion
---
That looks dope
---
Definitely the fastest way to get junk.
---
I tried adding you, but it couldn’t find you. Try adding us under ElfishFrixtion
---
unless people (like me) regularly deposit all of their junk into their stash.
---
i’m not sure about your point. by the time i saw the serums hitting the marketplace for 200 caps, the vendors were already buying them at the prices they are now (and again, that was a selling point of the low-priced serums—that they could be resold for profit). i don’t believe vendor bot prices reinflated the cost of serums, i believe sellers not being ok with their items being resold has.  
---
that said, i’m absolutely noting that you (and several others who have now weighed in) are not intending their items for resale and are in fact bothered by it. i don’t want to be screwing anyone over; i just figured people were ok with this. apologies to all generous sellers, and i appreciate you helping the community.
---
I tried adding you but it couldn’t find you in the system. Try adding me at ElfishFrixtion
---
True. It's always the ones in excavator PA that havent stored anything in forever.
---
No but you do get the chance to chose the contractor perk eventually. That allows you use less materials while constructing. I think less materials means more buffet to build. I could be wrong.
---
If you are a casual player you won’t even care about power armour having an extra 10-20% damage resistance than regular armour, the only people who care about having the best of the best are people who play this game religiously every day. 
---
Even if you are a casual player that wants to use regular armour but still have the power armour dr, like I said you don’t need to spend weeks on the player market, you can do all your shopping for 1 star matching or unmatching gear in a single day and then go back in the game and have power armour damage resistances whilst surpassing the carry weight on the good power armours at the same time. 
---
The only thing power armour had the upper hand in previously was carry weight and rad resistance but that wasn’t even problematic for non power armour users. You can just have a full set of excavator in your inventory for 10 pounds. The only time you would need a ton of carry weight would be when you are farming and in that case you can just hop in your power armour for 10 mins and the throw it back in your inventory.
---
Now not only can you surpass power armour damage resistances outside of power armour (like before) the only way to have high damage resistance AND the highest carry weight at the same time is only outside of power armour.
---
There's also a specific stealth issue I've run into at West-Tek. If I approach the hell room door near the front entrance, quite often I go into Danger and Super Mutants start trying to shoot at me through the wall.
---
I noticed Captainnoob has been dealing with this in some of his recent videos too.
---
Since Patch 9 I've stopped trying to stealth that area and just blast through with Power Armor.
---
How much junk stuff could they have that you couldn’t get in 5 minutes killing super mutants at WV Lumber? 
---
It’s part of the game and Bethesda does literally warn the player taking it that it can happen so it’s not bad however why bother? 
---
Since they most likely have a stash box chances are also low they also stored it if they were smart! 
---
I guess I have to ask... no offense here but are you bored and that’s why someone would contest it? 
---
Almost every map has 50%+ unclaimed workshops... anyone can place a camp on a node of lead, acid, oil and more also. 
---
Personally I don’t get a lot from workshops when I can farm more material in far less time.
---
Its in all classic RPGs and MMOs. The higher level you are, the harder it is to level up. All the basic plans are easy to get too. If you need someone to help power level, I don't mind either.
---
I approve this message
---
I got this olive green army paint for x01. it was in the bunker, never see anyone wearing it. Looks like the green paint on t51
---
YES! Even non legendary ghouls seem to drop legendary items even when not in nuke zones... nothing great but good for scrip!
---
I also agree. Not seen the new one yet but plan on making my character look like him lol. He shoots like him, just looks like a meth head though.
---
No problem man, good hunting.
---
What a time to survive a nuclear fallout then be robbed by a Mr. Handy
---
Yes, but it's one of the highest dps weapons available. If you're trying to use guns that don't fit into your build ofc it's going to be subpar compared to weapons that do. No fucking shit.
---
If you've got heavy weapon perks, though, as a base weapon, only a few (maybe just one) other heavy weapons do more dps. So what was your point? "Hey look at me, I'm too cool to use this highly sought after weapon? I want to brag about it because I can't use it in my build." Or was it, "I'm bad at math and don't know how to calculate damage so I don't value one of the best weapons available to my build."
---
Ha! That’s a cool story! Lots of fun and cool peeps out there in the Wasteland! Hats off to him!
---
I've gotta start looking for a dark suit now. Anyone seen one available on their travels?
---
And the ‘blessed’ ones drop same prefix often, you can get a dozen nocturnal garbage in one run, good for scrip nothing else. 
---
The loot pool is tiny per server, I get exactly the same item from different ghouls many times, even two star items. Junkies black powder pistol with bash damage, two in a row, what’s the odd out of all the possible legendary combinations available? One in a billion? 
---
So now if I get a few same garbage prefix items in a row I hop server right away, there’s no point in getting more of the same stuff i don’t need.
---
Tested
---
Random players (spawned into my base two ppl attacking did nothing *i myself was in passive)
---
Teammates (had friends attack my deathclaw did nothing *again in passive)
---
I think the trick is to never enter pvp 
---
Can still die from animals that spawn by your base
---
...also just happened daisy my deathclaw wandered off into the wasteland wtf right caught her outside my camp compond. never to be seen again i keep checking Appalachia Humane Society but to no avail..dam robots
---
The main quests will take you in the correct direction for your level. You can also just wander off and see what you can find, maybe build your CAMP if you have some extra resources.
---
no worries lol
---
Super mutants for steal, lucky hole for lead, toxic Larry for acid, honey beasts for gold and adhesive, deathclaw island for gears. Did I miss anything?
---
Don’t it just figure....?
---
i use calibrated excsvator pa and like i said i store junk frequently
---
Such a fun idea 😂
---
Where?
---
I think they are referring to the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
If its just green like OP said Im pretty sure it just looks like regular night vision scopes for guns, it just makes everything really green and doesn’t actually show anything at night
---
Google.
---
10000 scrip per slot sounds about right.
---
Yeah that happens to me a lot, something you can do when your CAMP starts to act up a lot is just quit the server then rejoin. At least that's what works when my CAMP acts up.
---
Ok thanks
---
Dumb, hell. You got a keen eye stranger. :)
---
That’s terrible. Just to confirm the issue is only on one character right?
---
No.not fun.
---
Don’t go at people as if they called your mother a pig. I’m not bragging I’m just stating my opinion and exercising my freedom of speech, nor do you have the right to insults my intelligence or lack there of. I’m being civilized while you’re attempting (and failing horribly) to insult me at every corner
---
Pretty often when killing someone at a workshop the have 500+ stell for some reason.
---
There's a ton of replies to this so idk if anyone's posted this yet.. but, some armor has weapon weight reduction legendary effects. I have 3 pieces of armor I walk around with labeled ALT armor so I can easily pick it out when I need more inventory space. 
---
But, I also think the Fatman is under weighted for what it would weigh irl. They just wanted to make it light enough that people would actually carry it lol if it really weighed what a gun that size would irl no one would carry them. They're basically useless anyways. Just for fun guns
---
buddy of mine does something similar he goes to the vault on drops a perfectly preserved pie and a nukashine in the bodies around the vault.
---
Is that still in the game then? I thought it was a limited event a while ago.
---
It’s a weapon that does an amount of instant healing if shot at teammates, and sustained damaged over a period of time if shot at enemies.
---
Full charge and Power User are not really neccessary, using them is just wasting points imo.
---
Yes. I’ve started a new character to pass the time but I’m level 120 and sad that I might have lost all my stuff.
---
I got the same thing today. Reduced weight, no stars. It’s like the fixer or other such weapons with effects but no stars
---
Wait. Camp or workshop? If you were building your camp, most everything should be right where you placed it next time you log I .
---
It is fun.  It can still be grindy.  There is new content.  Do not restart your characters.  Most bugs have been fixed.
---
You will care about the drastic difference in radiation resistance when you want to go into a nuke zone, and a small increase in damage resistance actually makes a significant difference in how much damage you take. Going from 80% damage absorbed to 90% damage absorbed may seem like a minor difference, but it actually means you can take twice as much damage.
---
I was about to say this event. SBQ makes them spawn but it's not always the same ones. I'm short a scorched tick, which I'm doubting I'll see.
---
Enclave vendor in the military wing(have to be general) or sometimes I found it in the production vendor
---
Do you charge caps or anything?
---
I'm afk until Tuesday without my laptop. Send me a PM on Tuesday and I'll be happy to help.
---
Go.
---
See.
---
It.
---
Right.
---
Now.
---
Best of luck getting a reply, I’m not sure if there’s anything you can do but wait until the character loads up. Maybe try dming a community manager while you wait on your ticket.
---
I wish I could help more, I’ve never had it go more than 24h
---
I ended up finding a youtube video that pointed me to Johnson's acre. it's a cabin near savage divide, south of fort defiance. I got a pic of a level 10 wolf, after server hopping 4 times when all I saw were mole rats. hope this helps for anyone else
---
Cant tell you for sure if I've seen a tick there or not. I'm a high lvl so I generally only pay mind to the things that stagger me
---
I've heard story isn't over. Additional story to be released in future dlc's. But i have yet to even launch a nuke myself, so could be wrong.
---
It’s a missile silo I believe.
---
Why not? Explain why it's a bad idea
---
You didn't need to suggest it, it's how it will go. Like the stash.... Like the camp budget ... When people want increases in these things it'll never be enough. 
---
So when would be enough? Enough scrip to roll three 3*'s a day? 5? 7?
---
https://nolife.gg/guide/63140/fallout-76-backpack-mod-list-with-their-effects
---
There is no settling that debate.
---
"Its part of the game" is on one side.
---
"Go play survival" on the other.
---
"betcha I can log off before you kill me" is where I stand.
---
Isnt that just the nuke silo launch bay?
---
Thanks. I did that earlier as I’m sort of giving up. I know it’s only a game but I’ve just got the 8 possum badge for the upgrade. That was a hard grind and don’t think I can do that again.
---
I actually also stumbled across this last night while looking for this camp spot I saw a couple days ago &amp; stupid me moved my map marker without thinking. Looks interesting &amp; could be involved in Nuclear Winter especially if you can’t build on it.
---
Same here mostly but that knocking noise when roaches, ants etc hit you gets right on my nerves.
---
Look man, I'm just trying to tell you, that you're wrong. Instead of being like, "Oh, my mistake I never really thought about it or did the math." You doubled up on being a dipshit. I absolutely have the right to say anything I like, just like you do. You're not being any more civilized than I am, it's just that your jabs are a bit deeper seeded. You're being hypocritical with your high road here by painting me in a bad light. I've barely said anything bad until now. You're being exceptionally stupid and I have no problem letting you know. So go ahead and play the victim, I'll be an asshole.
---
This. Dont want to get wrecked in pvp dont go to pvp zones... or just be ready to bail.
---
Happened to me a week and a half ago. Have an open ticket with Bethesda and still no reply or update. Unfortunately you won’t be able to play on that account for a long tine, if ever. My main (lvl 180) is basically gone along with my stuff unless they miraculously fix it. Sorry this happened to you also :/
---
Are you saying have them on all the time? If you have them work passively then you are wasting perk points while not crafting.
---
Make sure to pick Good Doggy.
---
If you kill Mothman he turns into a ash pile, no matter what btw. But yeah the not lootable thing is a bug I apologize
---
It’s decent for fast guns in boss fights because when you keep firing the boss’s damage output is constantly reduced which is great for everyone fighting it. For ghouls and super mutants you’ll be one-shotting them anyways with your harpoon before they output anything lol. Your drop is awesome, the suppressors effect is icing on the cake.
---
That's where the missile exits the silo when you launch it.
---
Now you just need to find the fletchet mod. Big exploding heavy shotgun.
---
I just got one of these guns from the vendor today too what mods did you decide on?? Also did the green laser disappear/turn to red when you applied the mods? I hear that's a problem with the pistol.
---
how the hell did you do it?
---
Haha I know exactly what you mean. When that happens I dont even switch to my secondary weapon. They get the big gun
---
Wait how did you get this fixed? I’m pretty sure the same thing happened to me a week and a half ago and haven’t been able to log into my lvl 180 since then. I have an open ticket but havent heard back in a week.
---
After the first hundred damage resistance, the more you get has increasingly diminishing returns when it comes to regular gameplay. It completely depends on how much damage creatures do and considering the game is incredibly easy apart from about 3 events, it really won’t matter for the casual player which is the person you are talking about. Also where is the “80-90% damage absorbed means double damage taken” coming from can I ask?
---
Not when it’s me.  First thing I make after capturing a workshop is a stash.  I sometimes have one by each extractor, and always dump immediately.  
---
You may get a bear or two that purposely don’t scrap, that’s about it.
---
😉
---
All my hounds are leashing too early today. Where did you lure it from?
---
Cool, sounds good!
---
Dog, it's a discussion lol people are just having fun. Let them argue over weight and density of virtual items. Nothing in any video game thread really matters. It's all just for fun :P
---
I added to a conversation and contributed to a community and expressed my opinion and you attacked me as if I did something wrong
---
I had an explosive harpoon in my shop for 3000 and none gave a damn. Scrip.
---
Does it change how the backpack looks?
---
May i ask how many hours OP has played?
---
“I’m not even mad that’s amazing”
---
You sound like you could be being a bit of a dick, 
---
I’m sure in every day life you’re a thoroughly splendid person, but that post really does exude feckwafflery.
---
Since then? Wow. 
---
Personally had it happen to my character a few times and a new character when trying to reproduce it with a friend, and none lasted more than 24h with a ticket.
---
One guy had it for 48h and I thought that was exceedingly long.
---
Maybe resubmit a ticket, and dm a community manager. I really wish I could help you more but I guess the support has been slower lately
---
MODUS Production terminal
---
Close too 400 hours
---
Buy mutatin serum recipe in the bunker , thats what i did. Stupid i know :-)
---
Hey I'd love to get one from you as well. Mitchon_Twitch is my ingame
---
Yep... horrible timing too as I wanted to max my scrip before the Purveyor came out. I have a few community managers I’ve been talking to but so far no luck. Hopefully one day it’ll get fixed but I’m not playing even on my alts until then. Thanks for writing this up!
---
Yeah my turret turned on me before. Just me, not my camp. It wouldn't actually damage me,but was annoying as would open fire anytime i was within range.
---
Fix was to scrap the turret and place a new one.
---
ha! didn't even think of that, good point :)
---
Press x to doubt
---
Picked up some WWR armor and never looked back, hope they reduce weights or add in a perk soon though
---
I'd rather they add mods for an already powerful weapon and keep the ammo as is. Make it a monster of a weapon but require great investment for it's power
---
OK try 00huntr00 my bad..
---
No they dont. I had to rebuild due to this. Maybe you can team up with someone to test before you build ?
---
I have close to 1100h if not over . 1 drop that is worth mentioning. A 2* Handmade. But its kind of the point and what keeps many ppl playing. The grind
---
If you still need help ill be glad to We could also do the swimmer challenge where you need to be revived in shallow water. MSG me if you are interested.
---
This tends to happen for a while after whitespring is nuked and the radiation dissipates, non legendary ghouls will drop legendary items. Most people don't stick around after the nuke zones gone so it makes for easy farming.
---
I agree. 
---
This helmet shouldn’t be a PC exclusive.
---
What do you mean by real world exchangers? 
---
In response to other points, I kind of like it the way it is. It gives me an opportunity to see people's camps. Additionally, as an unwritten rule / plan a lot of us traders have set up shop just to the east of whitespring. You can usually hop for 1-5 caps between 4-6 camps between the whitesprings train station and top of the world.
---
No height issues surprisingly top floor is basically maxed out though. I tried to put a couple of the shorter street lights but the wires were too high to connect.
---
Woah you must have done a lot of research for that one
---
The Hornwright and Order of Mysteries quests have been my favorite of the game by far, for the exact reasons you described.
---
That would be badass
---
I can give you the 3 of each when I get home from work this evening
---
I find gulpers to be much tougher TBH
---
I agree.
---
Dont really understand context.
---
That being said, the only way to pacify the wasteland in survival is listening to Big Iron from fonv in my opinion. Very gratifying.
---
How do you carry around that big dick of yours all day?
---
It's not attached to camp budget. Trust me. I had a maxed budget before vending and I now have a maxed budget plus 4 full machines. The message is actually about your stash size. Make space in your stash and you can add more to the vending machines.
---
I still experience the damage bug with explosive weapons...
---
grats. This is slightly off topic but a day ago  I earned and bought my high capacity backpack mod it unlocked it for me and it also gave me the plans for it under my notes. It seems like I can give it out to some one. Not sure what to do with it, thought of reporting but having trouble finding the correct topic to report it under.
---
Cool I have just logged out I am UK time and have 3 hours untill I have to go to bed. Hate having to work lol joke
---
That doesn't frustrate you?
---
nope
---
It could have just been a paint job
---
I’m certainly hoping that some future dlc content reverts back to the original fallout style of atmospheric story telling. 
---
The last few lots of additional content have been great fun and I’m loving the backpack too, but I’d really like something grittier with some greater depth and substance to it.
---
This breaks the rules if the sub. Its going to get removed and you look like an ass.
---
Exactly considering the whole timeline was set right around Halloween lol
---
But it wont let me sell stuff already in my stash
---
EDIT: there seems to be a glitch where it goes to instadeath whether teamed, pvp, or alone. Does anyone else have this issue?
---
I'd be really disappointed if they don't add FREE Halloween themed camp items. We have raider skulls, but they're not free.
---
Well I can give them to you another time if you need them
---
It has to do with how Bethesda Austin is approaching adding content to the game. You'll notice over time that the world loads first, then a secondary loading occurs. During the secondary loading, things like player bases and loaded but this also includes changes they make to the game world. Biv's door, the perveyor, the manholes to burrows, etc. Anything that was added on later to the game is tacked on instead of built into the files. This is going to bite them in the long run. I'm curious if this is a way to circumvent the larger file patches that people complained about. Regardless, it is annoying and we have to stand around and wait for the invisible loading screen to finish.
---
Maybe for you, but all I did was give them a caffeinated beverage. Never had it in me to perform the overseer's tests to her word and instead tried to go for the best option for the dwellers.
---
Hey i m just scared because i heard you can be hacked very easy in this game.
---
Welp just found another, I think. On PC btw.
---
Been putting off Bucket List as ... meh. Decided I'd knock it out as I was in the Mire for other reasons. Took the last photo, the screen splash showed up and then it listed the zoom lense, photomode frame and CAMP poster as reward. All I got was the 100 caps. 
---
Shows the quest as completed in the Pip-Boy, but I can't mod the camera with the lense nor build the goofy poster. 
---
Don't really care about the stuff that much but I did the dumb leg work give me the stuff!
---
A little . But i got the guns and armor from 3 irl friends when they quit around christmas . U have a good point but i think they should raise drop rates from 3* enemies instead to drop 3* items
---
Ohhhhh that would make sense
---
Is it true it *reduces* DR? Is so that's proper shitty for PvP
---
When an item is in your stash you then go to the vending machine you want it to be in. Scroll through and find the item. The item then transfers to your character. You can then click it again and set a price. The item will then return to your stash and be listed in the vending.
---
There has never been a single verified report of anyone being "hacked" here and you need to stop.
---
And i m not accusing him of being a hacker, i m just asking.
---
I asked a random player at white springs station if I could revive them yesterday and she totally hooked me up. I really appreciate the sense of community in this game. 
---
Thank you fellow wanderer!
---
Can you win the pie in the claw game?? I have hit that machine everytime i see one but just like in irl i think its rigged!
---
I just want a way to remove a little bit of random chance from it, it's not over powered being able to buy one legendary mod for a large amount of scrip, you could only use it once and if it was around 500 scrip that's a lot of legendarys you'd have to scrap
---
Besides Fast Traveling into walls and under buildings, there is also the problem of doors that are locked from the inside with no other way to get out of the camp. You either have to pick the lock and become wanted or fast travel away again.
---
Raider PA with Rider-Paint?
---
I don' t know if this 100% legit but  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9zkbu0/a\_warning\_to\_the\_community\_player\_accounts\_being/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9zkbu0/a_warning_to_the_community_player_accounts_being/)
---
absolutely amazing work this is such a good idea and well thought out and fits so well!
---
one thing i might change would be the liberator to be an alternate projectile for your CAMPS artillery piece
---
I honestly didn’t even consider that!! Now it definitely MUST be done.
---
Yep best way to do it is completing the quest so you can get a free recall card and start it yourself. After that it takes 2000 caps to get the circuit, one fluorescent flux and copper to craft the recall card. 
---
Fewer people do it now be because the loot was usually a piece of wood armor, sometimes a drill, after you spend 30 stimpaks and a thousand rounds of ammo and beat the sheep if you’re lucky. After recent patch they probably improved the loot table. I got a sentinel armor and an explosive handmade from that event, both three stars, after more than a dozen wood pieces.
---
And i m particularly scared because i play on pc.
---
I noticed a level 20 something in a full set of ultracite pa a couple of days ago, I’ve no idea how that’s possible and did consider reporting it as there is absolutely no reason I’m aware of for this being possible.
---
Ah shoot. Forgot about that one.
---
plague rider skin on a x01
---
Lured one from huntersville and walked it all to the behemoth at the lake where it spawns
---
That tells you how many of His incarnations I have... desecrated so far.
---
Which is one, this one, in give or take 1400 combined hours played (1232 in this character).
---
Either way thanks for the FYI :)
---
Zero evidence or proof in this claim. I could make that exact post right now as a karma grab.
---
What platform you playing on?
---
There used to be fast travel mats but I guess people were using them for traps?
---
yeah get em outta the claw machine but there is one place you can find it out in the open.. on top of the west tek building there is a slice sitting on the roof.. but in the machines have to have decent luck.. there is a lot of math involved but basically it takes into account your luck, how many times you have clicked that same machine and so on to calculate your % chance to get a pie.. my luck is 9 and i can usually get a pie from a machine between the 8th and 12th click usually.. ive acquired 15 through machines.. 
---
the buddy i mentioned above, got radded out, used unyeilding armors, took a bunch of drugs, became addicted maxing out his luck well beyond cap, and ended up pulling around 101 pies out of the machines. his favorite being in flatwoods.. my favorite or luckiest pie machine was the watoga coffee shop machine.
---
You can craft that power armor. Just ask a friend with the plans.
---
Both Hornwright and MoM quests are my favorite too.
---
Yes sir!!
---
Xbox.
---
It was definitely the best one yet!
---
Understandable
---
You probably won't find that in a vending machine  most players who have one are serious traders and can't sell it for caps because of the cap limit.
---
How long did you wait before ft away? I've had it happen several times before. I wait a good 2 minutes or more and eventually everything loads out. So much going on, server can't keep up and takes a while for rendering on your end. Just be careful, because while it loads, you might be getting hit by invisible enemies and suddenly drop health from what appears to be out of nowhere.
---
Mate, it's hard... Although easier when it's on flop.
---
GET HIM BOIS
---
Order of mysteries is amazing, and I won't take anything away from it. But Hornwright gets the edge from me because it feels like such an accidental discovery. It's brilliant from beginning to end.
---
I thought using pa parts were levelled? At level 25 I couldn’t equip and use ultracite pieces?
---
It was a great feeling. They left server shortly afterwards. They literally bully low levels, and just constantly sapwn camp.
---
I know there is the Dense mods for regular armor, and there used to be Explosive Shielding for PA in FO4.
---
39 and Xbone
---
For loot purposes just do WS and forget everything else. Super fast and easy and takes no prep or teamwork. Boss fights are really for the fun in fighting, at least that’s what Bethesda had planned. Haven’t got any wood from sbq but rolling pins and tire irons are common, anything better than those should be a nice surprise.
---
Now that workshop PvP is confined to the workshop in Adventure, I personally see no issue with it. If they haven’t stashed their junk it’s kind of on them. However, the people you kill will definitely see it the other way. 
---
Personally, I just stick to Survival when I’m in the mood for PvP. There are still plenty of Power Armor Loot Piñatas to be found and I’d rather do it in a mode where I know everyone knows what they’re signing up for. 
---
Just the other day I killed a guy who dropped 200 lbs of junk and aid. Those drops are more rare in Survival, but there’s still plenty to be had.
---
You can buy plans from the Enclave Bunker....production terminal, I believe.
---
i just keep re-rolling everything he gives me, maybe one day il get those vampire weapons id like
---
I just used an automatic pistol. Didn't work either. I assume it's rifle and above.
---
Just mini nuke the fuck out of em
---
I din't say to ban him.I just wanted to ask if a should be worried about this.What karma points do anyway ?
---
Sounds like he probably got hate messages etc for playing the game how it's supposed to be played. Don't cry over spilt milk is my message to people who play solo. Take your milk back to storage in your camp then go out in the wild.
---
You clearly don't understand the context. Using words like exude makes you sound like an utter Tw@.
---
Im about to go back online in about a hour and do a silo run because im needing the same stuff, we'll team up and hit up a blast zone if you want?
---
He was in the power armor
---
No, I don't have.
---
Ultracite pieces you can equip only at level 50
---
They should give us dispensers for our camps to hand out whatever we may have too much of. (Like candy)
---
I’m on PC... so can’t help you out with weapons &amp; mods (
---
You shouldn’t really be worried about legendaries until you are past level 50.
---
Oblivion (same engine) had their own interpretation of night vision - it had blue tint, but rendered with constant lighting and without shadows.
---
I find myself store (both player and train stations) hoping looking for legendaries for cheap. I’ve bought more junk *** than ever just for the chance for something better.
---
We got grim reaper as the death power armour
---
Tried but there a loophole now.... You can't damage camp items, doors, walls etc... Unless they appear red, if you put your gun away and build around yourself you become invincible in survival, until your weapon is drawn. Or you have a clear shot. If they pull there gun out they're classed as aggressive therefore letting you damage there camp. Hard to explain it but this is there new tactic.
---
Was the power armour a dirty green colour with pustules on it, if so that’s the plague rider XO1 P.A skin that makes all power armour look like XO1, the same way the other horsemen of the apocalypse skins made P.A look like a certain models when they were actually something different, I’m guessing if it was a plague rider XO1 you saw then it was just someone wearing raider armour with that skin but if it wasn’t dirty green with pustules I’ve no idea
---
that's where the nuke deploys.
---
Both ash piles and plasma goo are bugged. Try to avoid using energy or plasma weapons on valuable mobs for now.
---
just a heads up seems that since the last patch alot of the vendors are selling mod plans also...
---
[https://imgur.com/QgbTU1W](https://imgur.com/QgbTU1W)
---
wow I never knew there was a vendor there thanks dude
---
No I didn't. I corrected your inaccurate statement. Then you were rude to me and argued with me about some semantics that weren't even true until you went back and edited your first post. Once you showed me exactly what sort of dipshit you were, then yes, the gloves came off. Now you're trying to backpeddle and play the good guy when you were the asshole to start with. Nice try but that shit doesn't fly.
---
Bruh why are you in the subreddit if you don't want to see FO76 stuff? Just unsubscribe from it and leave us to have a good time without you.
---
Where did u find the mounted yao guai head?
---
i can give you one now if you want, i can be on in a few minutes
---
I'm literally green with envy. Never have time with kids and work. I'll have to take a day off, from who though... Work or family?
---
What you lot think?
---
it didn't give me an option to revive you
---
tried to do it but they give up on me half way to behemoth
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I thought that’s what happened. I’m not sure why that is, give me a second
---
Exactly. All the fallouts were. Like a few weeks before hand. They need to finally incorporate it
---
Honestly, I just go for 2 stars on ranged weapons. The odds of getting a decent 3rd star like reduced weight don't justify spending twice as much scrip.
---
That said, yes, 90% of the stuff I've rolled has gone straight back into the legendary wood chipper, although I have pulled a couple of things that would be awesome for some folks like an assassin's mole miner gauntlet with faster swing speed, a hunter's explosive pipe rifle, and a TS ultracite gatling laser with +10% damage while aiming.
---
I don’t remember which part of the quests specifically. It was one of the side quests on the board in Calvin’s office though iirc.
---
I put my kid to bed then went to a late show. Was worth being tired in the morning. 🤷‍♂️
---
There are several sections of vendors in the bunker - production, medical, science, and armory. All sell different stuff. If you're looking for them, keep in mind that they're just terminals.
---
Any chance I could get one as well?
---
Ok thx for responding m8
---
It’s not high enough. It won’t work for me

Do you have a stimpack with you
---
I jump around a fair bit with my quad explosive flechette harpoon gun.  Air gap helps when they rush you.
---
I went to same camp but was wise lol..that said I did laugh my ass off at several catapulted players, brilliant idea
---
Not wrong but you won’t make any friends. In fact more likely to make enemies that will slowly plan out a well devised and foolproof revenge strategy  that will hit you at the worst possible time. 
---
But hey lead scrap!!
---
Np! Yeah I never fought one until about a week ago. Now I’ve killed 3! (In about half your time sir I’m closing in on 700) hope they fix the looting bug period doesn’t happen often but seems to happen only when it’s important.. like a 3 star legendary even though it’ll likely give me a one star😂
---
Really? I gotta try that, its like 5 levels lower than me but makes short work of level 45 enemies. I read that there is a stimpack recipe ill try to find that too. So

What's the best way to get caps?
---
Hurt it with normal guns, bash it to death with the butt of the syringer
---
Shoot it with another gun to wear it down then syringer for the kill
---
Beach Boys are a group of griefer, I hate the word and it gets thrown around way to much but these guys are exactly that.
---
They use stealth boys all the time to counter everything, vats especially. I managed to grab a shit load off them and drop them before they got them back. A beach boy without his stealthboys is... Nothing.
---
Take most of it's health away with another weapon and then quickly swap weapons to syringer and finish it off.
---
Is the harpoon gun considered heavy? Bullet Shield under strength gives damage resistance when firing a heavy weapon.
---
The alien blaster with the fusion cell conversion, cannot even destroy balloons...
---
Yeah that's what's been happening to me. I've gotten some cool weapons but nothing that suits my build. I've enjoyed playing around with the stuff I've got though.
---
I'm heavy weapons so that Gatling laser you got would have been awesome for me.
---
I'd love to try this sort of build out, but as I'm spec for rifleman, I'd need to grind out at least 20 levels just to fix the SPECIAL points. :/
---
IDK about you, but I'd rather have people constantly 'invisible' (who are also easy to counter) than people 1-shotting with VATS crits.
---
Damn, good call!
---
In reply to your message calling me a twat and claiming I don’t understand context.
---
Context: killed people, posted a thread on a public forum boasting about it and insulting the other players.
---
Pardon me for having an education. I retract my previous comment about you being a thoroughly splendid person in every day life. You Sir, are a feckwit.
---
sure my ign is grnlion123456
---
My BE laser rifle sounds like papapapapa blooshpfftpftt
---
Use a regular weapon to bring the bear down to a sliver of health and then use the syringer. That's how I did it
---
While I haven’t gotten anything good for me, I have rolled a few really good pieces. I’ve handed those off to friends, so while they don’t benefit me directly, they do when we’re teamed up. 
---
What I don’t find immediately useful I put in my vendors for 150-200 per star and recycle the trash. 
---
With the prevalence of so many 3* pieces in the world now, I have found a number of great things at vending machines for low prices. People are rolling good things, it just takes those indirect mechanisms to spread them around.
---
I personally did it with the bleedout syringer. Basically a DoT.
---
Great input! Please die
---
cool man, I knew about the science and all the other ones just never knew about production. mind is blown lol
---
I server hopped dolly sods because there are two that always spawn there. Try to get the yay guai down to pretty low health, then melee him with the syringer. Melee kills with the weapon still work
---
Handmade is one of the best weapons in the game.  Also what I use.
---
Probably the red robes and white hat.
---
There's a bleeding syringer that does more like 30 damage. Use it. Also, it's best to get the bear near death and whip out the syringer for the killing blow.
---
Thanks, I’m use a heavy explosive PA build with a TSE .50 cal and even when mobs are right in front of me the damage is drastically reduced.
---
&gt;I'm heavy weapons so that Gatling laser you got would have been awesome for me.
---
If you're on xbox I have it sitting in my vending machine for 1k caps. Just join my server and come grab it :)
---
I rock PA 75% of the time with a heavy weapons build. Stabilized, Power User, batteries included. I also have power patcher and fix it good for repairs. 
---
Even with my regular armor you can’t beat the damage sponge of PA.
---
true maybe a pumpkin orange or vampire one instead
---
IDK about you, but I'd git gud.
---
Top Tip, if you can vats someone... They can vats you, keep good distance. Automatic for close range and semi for medium-long. Works a treat for me.
---
plenty of them
---
That what I thought, still baffled as to how a low level was wearing it though lol.
---
Sounds like a plan. Thank you kind sir.
---
Damn, PS4. I would have been there immediately.
---
ok  
---
Not having much time to play can mean many different things to different people- I play a few hours a day and will give my method of making caps - i have 6 luck (effects condition, thus value of weapons) aand 6 charisma and use maxed out hard bargain (though been thinking on not using it lately, just like I stopped using grape mentats except when i buy very expensive plans)  
---
I just go to a place where there are lots of super mutants (or others though they are not as good) and a vendor clear the area, and take everything then sell it all NOT scrapped and this usually clears the 1400- takes me about an hour  
---
my preferred places are top of the world area and Harpers Ferry (someone will always show up and the enemies will respawn so i don't know if this can be done with one pass)  
---
Also, you can almost clear the 1400 by doing Uranium Fever and taking everything if there are lots of player s doing it- i generally get at least 20 glowing meat = 20 steaks = 200 caps each time
---
Thats weird, at least it worked!
---
Yup, I have nothing to show for the effort I’ve put into waiting patiently in that goddamn line.
---
thanks.. it only counted for one of the revives.. I didn't get swimmer but I am closer than before
---
enjoy your pack!
---
It might also blow your mind then to know that's where they sell X-01 PA mod PLANS.
---
It's intentionally left hanging to be addressed in future dlc as far as we know.
---
You didn’t?? I’m coming back on, give me a moment
---
High key might actually play this game if that’s a thing. It sounds so fun. I bought FO76, played an hour, and it just, no pun intended, fell out for me:
---
Dracarys
---
The quest is still active because it isn't over yet. They're saving more of her story for DLC.
---
Same here. There's a certain point the dog refuses to go past and starts going back
---
It be like that sometimes
---
so i just got the treated lining plan, will they sell the other three, resistant , protective and shielded?
---
You have no idea how many times I've run Census Violence and Line in the Sand trying to get that plan .... :(
---
ya and thanks for the heads up as well. very good it know that its a waste
---
I spend less time in the game due to the limit than I would if the limit was higher. With vending my stash is always close to full, so I can't farm incessantly, I can only farm until I've got my next 150 scrip worth of legendaries. There's really not much for me to do in the game these days other than farm legendaries, so if I can't do that there's not much point in playing. I'd visit the game daily regardless; the limits are actually causing me to spend less time in-game.
---
Mine is Mitchon_Twitch added you
---
Gatling gun. a gun that has a default magazine so large that the extended magazine isn't of any use.
---
If you need 1000 rounds you are doing something very wrong.
---
You can make a new character and the event will work on the first try. Helpful if you have a buddy to clear the area for you.
---
Thank you so much for testing this! I hope you find Daisy again one day ):
---
Same here i was going to give it to my brother but he hasnt been online haha
---
Even if this ends up being only a community thing I suggest everyone to start stocking up some candies and goodies to give as treats cuz this is def going to be a huge thing on Halloween 👌✨
---
Nope just upgrades to 120 + carry weight 👍
---
Oh is it? Okay, cool
---
I've seen one at site prime, Charleston and top of the world since yesterday, no server hopping
---
The Invisible Loading Screen sounds like a millennial/generation z horror movie....
---
Ah shit did anyone make sure SyFy wasn’t in the vicinity?! That idea was so bad they may make it real like Bigfoot vs Zombies... or 10-headed Shark Attack....
---
I’ve never got it from Line in the Sand only from Census. One plan I haven’t had drop yet from Census is the Shielded Marine Wetsuit I just traded for that but I think that drops from Census as well. Don’t give up trying for it you’ll get it eventually and any copies you get you can easily sell for 10k caps.
---
This still won’t let my partner ask for a revival
---
Yep, that thing was dope.
---
Ouchhh, would you rather me say that it defeats the point of any game to be able to pick and choose the exact build with the exact pieces you want and play against thousands other who do the same in a game that is supposed to last for years? What engaging pvp that would be and I’m sure no one would be burnt out after a few months of having all the same equipment. Is that better? Do I get to live now?
---
The key....because of explosive...is to get the flechett mod for it..lots of dmg and never have to worry about ammo again
---
Trust me this post actually has legs.
---
Removing quests seems super counterintuitive. With all do respect other than adding chat, most of these just sound awful for Fallout 76
---
I'd recommend just playing  ARK. 
---
•No quests
---
• Tribes (A.K.A Factions)
---
• You can start tribe wars
---
• Kill anyone, without consequence
---
• Can stay on one server permanently
---
•Be as rude as you want, people are normally only banned for hacking.
---
• Tribes can build large "towns"
---
Yes, thankyou, that's was actually a good point
---
Need a dispenseh heah!
---
I dunno where else to try it..
---
Yes!! I would love a greenhouse too, especially with the capability to grow other flora found in the wasteland.
---
You could always drop a nuke yourself.
---
Come to the river next to your camp
---
Sold a few back, limited by the 150 scrip per day.  Only play less than an hour per day now. Whoever came up with all those nonsense caps is really killing the game.
---
Take my upvote! *imagines my vendor station full of trick or treat costumes for 0caps
---
I got one the other day. Vampire explosive assault rifle with 15% faster reload. My best drop by far, it’s mostly junk.
---
we need robot it would be stupid not to adapt what was made for fallout 4
---
I went ham with a syringer screaming on one... went through 100 stims and had to resort to bashing its head in.
---
Then someone over a headset asked why I didn’t wear it down with an actual weapon first.
---
Don’t do what I did...
---
Huh? As far as i know plans and recipes are always consumed when you learn them. If they weren't for you, then it was a bug.
---
He's saying those cards should work even if they're not equipped.
---
Did you ever order the NVGs listed for sale at the back of a comic? Spoiler alert: you will be disappointed.
---
That must be really new. I dropped 3000 caps on a wanderer for the mod. Lol
---
That’s always supposed to happen.
---
That's awesome!! I havent come across anything like that yet. Hopefully they see this post and let other wastelanders in on the fun.
---
They can be, with the right mods and perks
---
Haha well thank you and it was a shit post on my end so good policing op
---
Picked up one @ Ft Defiance last night.
---
It had a small DR rating on it.  Did not try to equip it.
---
Ok cool
---
Unless it’s been broken since launch, that should always happen...
---
&gt; it has now taken centre stage as the main thing to do. And quite frankly it’s boring now 
---
Damn right. Have an upvote.   It has indeed turned the game boring.
---
My dad just moved his camp to 63 and the railroad by Morgantown. Looks like a neat place.
---
Workshop.
---
This!
---
Wouldn't that be great?
---
Yes i think once you’ve learned the plan, when you visit the vendor again you will see other mod plans, just pay them a few visits and learn the play after you buy them.
---
Every Plan is just one time use sadly. A resell is therefore not possible
---
Well this has been a rude awakening haha I have previously been able to sell all my plans
---
Which also makes sense it shouldn't work since it's single action. Single action is basically slow to fire because of design. Hence they invented double action pistols to increase fire rate.
---
Well i think i will not get a cat then.. my place spawns enemies and they will kill it
---
What I hate is that certain items seem to have double the potential to be generated as others ..... the higher the stars, the more likely the drop ..... I'm talking about "Wood" armour, especially in comparison with Combat armour that has THREE types (light, sturdy and heavy) but doesn't drop near as much as the wood that only has ONE type.
---
I would love for someone to compile an actual statistical variance study on this, but I am almost sure that their are inhibitors within the algorithms to make the "randomness" far less than random.
---
I could easily list 10+ more pages same kind of bugs and glitches, but fanatic Bethesda fans would down vote it to the ground. Just to simplify things it is easy to say that quality isn't important factor in Bethesda games.  They create as cheap games as possible to maximize profits where testing is outsourced for gamers.
---
Well fuck. I feel dumb. Makes sense its where the nukes exit.
---
An event that revolves around collecting candy from plastic pumpkins at peoples' camps would be really cool.  Turn in candy for event specific stuff.
---
OMG I'm sorry it's too deep there it won't let me res you be a use the water is over your head when you go down..
---
that's why I thought Flatwoods was perfect..
---
Them's some clean inks. Lovely job!
---
Thank for the help everyone will be back on after some choirs to do
---
I thought it was another one of the "BURROW'S"
---
I wonder what the timing is? Because you are steadily firing you get a steady buff, I wonder if it lingers enough that it will benefit the harpoon.
---
Hahaha
---
Wow, that's an interesting bug, never heard of anyone having this lol.... to be clear, you can pick up the same plan again and resell. Will appear with a "known" next to it going forward. But the very first one should have always been consumed.
---
This. And best spot is the parking lot of Philippi Battlefield Cemetery with a static lower level yao guai spawn
---
I really don’t know what is happening? Let’s try one more time
---
Thank you kind sir. Although from my upvotes it would seem others don’t agree.
---
Yeah because a game of 'who can aimbot first' is fun.
---
The weight thing could very well be busted. I remember the weight thing being a theory back in FO3 or FO4. Maybe that's all replaced with a table by weapon type, as you mentioned, or possibly the theorycrafters back in the day were simply wrong. :)
---
As you mentioned, it's difficult to tell. There's the classic example of the Armor Pen. magazines that have "Improved" and "Superior" texts but a popular FO4 mod that showed the bonuses had a flat 40% across the board. Afaik the Gauss still has the flavor text for Standard and another mod swapped - Standard says improved range while the other mod says "Standard".
---
Even new weapons have nonsense text. I think it's the Sheepsquatch Club that has two mods with one saying "Greatly Improves Damage" and the other says "Improves Damage" - but the base damage is the same across either.....
---
This is only made worse by "types" being confused. In 76 the grenade launcher double dipped for a while (fixed now), the plasma flamer with a rifle stock is a semi auto rifle, .... It's all very arbitrary. :(
---
I sometimes crash when eating melons.
---
I was also crashing after a successful lockpicking attempt, but that's not happening since the last patch.
---
I think those might be connected somehow.
---
Unlikely and hopefully not.
---
People are **terrible** at noticing differences between the uniforms used by various ww2 factions. 
---
Adding such uniforms to fallout it's like asking for trouble.
---
When I go to a player camp and see hundreds of serums for sale I’m pretty sure duping hasn’t been fixed.  
---
Like the one dude that had 24000 stimpaks for sale lol
---
I see more people suggest this yet I tried it but it didn't check off.
---
Now it might be because I was also helped by my workshop turrets.
---
Going to try again without the turrets.
---
Thanks to all for the answers.
---
Back to Dolly Sods.
---
Do you want to try flatwoods again? I’ll head there
---
I wonder if the nuke zone always shows up on the first map read. It didn’t for me.
---
Had this happen to me, I turned off xbox... Unplugged it and left it a while. That clears the cache on Xbox and when I turned it back on it was sorted... Hope this helps.
---
I always knew that zetans dropped the bomb first. At least kind of. Tiny bit.
---
I tried it at dolly sods and those are pretty high level. Thanks for the tip. Going to try your parking lot first.
---
Once I get some damned neon letter plans I know what I’m calling my shop and it’s tagline
---
Your flare is responders.... Respond.
---
Yeah, I'm mainly self mercing indoors with low head clearance, but agree that is a super effective strategy
---
If you're on xbox come join my server. Someone nuked whitesprings about an hour ago so you should have enough time for a couple of runs before it fades. I was also thinking of dropping a nuke, so if it fades I can blast the area again.
---
That’s true, otherwise I would love this game so much. But some bugs are very annoying (not game breaking) and should be fixed.
---
Some bugs I can laugh about and don’t mind.
---
I saw the personal terminal and thought great I can finally have a terminal on my desk, nope, they chose the most stupid model for it.
---
Combo of it being fun and it's a hard counter to sent/cav users.
---
Go to PVP (Survival) more.  If I had to guess at least 2/3 of the players participating are running duped weapons or armor - however they may have been acquired. And I think it’s gotten worse with player vending as the market is now flooded with that type of killer gear. 
---
I’ve been one or two shotted more in the last couple of days than an entire month playing survival.  And I’m not some lvl14 running low level gear or weapons.
---
Ayyy were you playing around on it last night too?
---
Game caps at 90% weapon weight reduction, essentially making all weapons like the "Weightless" perk.  I can carry 15+ weapons on my character and I'm still well under 100 pounds total weight. I've carried 2000 pounds of weapons before and have not been encumbered. Lol
---
For real, I'd love to start seeing people get creative with their camps and start making platforming sections of the world with rewards or something.
---
badass and fallouty is the perfect descriptor sir o7
---
I’ve been in survival before and during this last week or so.  It’s absolutely rampant.
---

---
I found a quad single action with faster fire rate. Somehow it will let you slowly load 24 rounds into a 6 shooter, a very long process, but it won't let you shoot your 24 round 6 shooter faster.
---
I get it but my only argument is that it shouldn't be included in the list of legendaries if it doesn't work.
---
I’m sorry but this is a stupid comment. They could’ve fixed it &amp; just didn’t ban the specific player even though he has duped clearly... I wouldn’t run around throwing shit around like “duping isn’t fixed haha I saw a duped gun lmao haha lol” 80% of the guns people own on this sub are duped let’s be real. Doesn’t mean it’s happening unless said person is selling 24k stimpak’s then IMMEDIATELY refilling his machine with 24k more. That’s duping
---
"Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work you can always hit him with it."
---
I believe pretty much all chems overwrite each other in this game. My go-to is psychobuff just because it overall helps with all damage. Gives you a damage buff and 3 strength, so it's even better for melee. Afaik the only chems that stack are healing items (food just extends the recovery period, stimpaks will stack healing if you spam multiple of them) and rad-x
---
wait a second, where exactly are you speaking of now?
---
There’s two ways to look at it. There’s the way the game is intended to work, and then there’s the way it actually works. Taking workshops is *supposed* to be about taking the workshop, but it’s *actually* mostly just a way to enable pvp on people in adventure mode.
---
People aren’t wrong for being upset that it doesn’t work as intended, and you’re not wrong for playing the game as it actually is. The thing that’s wrong is the game. Limiting workshop pvp to the workshop zone is a good start, but it still needs a lot of work before it’s perfect.
---
I did the one at the Phillipi(sp?) Battle Cemetery, spawns in the parking lot. CAREFULLY whittle him down (I accidentally killed it twice) then bash him with the syringer.
---
It felt like around 2 minutes, but not sure. If it does happen again, I'll wait longer. The server was very unstable. The lag in my stash menu was definitely a clue. Thanks for the advice.
---
It's a bug. Try dying. It should get rid of it.
---
Same deal, although my main was a new character after the beta was over and i knew what i wanted. HW/explosives. New alt? Stealth vats sniper.
---
The sniper can be magical, but the heavy is goddamn Rambo.
---
ALSO ADD BULL BARRELS FOR .44s. thanks
---
My friends went in while I was outside cause the door got locked behind them.  Guy was waiting for people and closing it behind them 😂😂 pretty freaking awesome!
---
If it’s locked up, mobs can’t directly destroy it.
---
Oh yeah no I agree with you cause it's basically a wasted legendary roll. That quad shot sounds straight silly. I'm getting to the point in game where I'm going to start looking for good legendaries. Right now I basically just have shitty armor so I'm hoping I'll eventually get something decent.
---
When you say limit is 50, do you mean the maximum you’re allowed to build of them. Or that it was just how your budget limit fell? Curiouss as I want the plans and may need to adjust what I want to say if it’s a 50 limit
---
It’s more complicated to figure out where someone will generally spawn in based on your camp box, plus that location changes if someone else is already at your camp. The fast travel mat would make it extremely easy to have people spawn underwater, inside a locked room or on top of a spike trap, for example. Sure, someone who is dedicated can already do that but having a placeable target just makes it 10000% easier.
---
I have a small square room that is locked. This is my "AFK Box," so random baddies don't do creepy things to me when I'm.... AFK... The only thing in it is a stash box and a chair.
---
Do I have to die fully or can someone revive me?  Thank you by the way.  I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that lol.
---
The Enclave Bunker production terminal. It has the plans - calibrated shocks, Jetpack, stealth boy, Tesla coils, emergency protocols - you name it.
---
It looks like an old painting with a sinister twist. Love it
---
awesome.. I gotta go see a man about a backpack now !
---
I would loooooove to see those mods on the Auto Grenade Launcher and MG42. I've got an Anti-Armor MG42 and while it's plenty powerful, it's a bummer to have zero mods for it (I've heard there's a Prime Receiver but I've never found one). Same goes for the Crossbow. They showcased both those weapons in the trailers/teasers and yet they've got no mods to speak of. 
---
Also because my gun-nut friend would kill me if I didn't say it, a 'clip' ≠ a 'magazine/mag'.
---
Amazing great fantastic fun way to reduce that working memory in this massive multi-task demanding game!
---
There was a bug last patch where modding anything didn’t work at all. This patch fixed it, except apparently X-01 helmet mods. I think it’s still a bug
---
Delete the character?
---
Can someone(dataminers, people with screenshots) confirm legendary alienblasters can be gotten from the purveyor?
---
I used a deathclaw gauntlet. I mentioned using a melee weapon in the post and Is in the screenshot.
---
Real world exchanger/Websites and individuals seeking item for real world currency. Sorry I wasn't very clear. And I do like the way it is set up right now. But these are y thoughts on improvement. But maybe my ideas dont matter as much. Lol.
---
That can't be good for your complexion.
---
This is how I did the Yao Guai with the stringer, since I don’t have any recipes for loaded syringes and I was essentially dealing 6 damage with a break barrel rifle lmao
---
All I want is the dam rear half of the rifle to not get mysteriously deleted when you mod an auto receiver onto it... Looks rediculous
---
For me, the lever action is the best mix of power, accuracy, and rate of fire. Second is the handmade. My opinion only....
---
Haha, Jug showed everyone how to do this a few months ago.
---
I wanted to add a pun as tip of the iceberg, but i cant come up with anything
---
All factors considered (recoil, dps, etc) I'm gonna say it's the handmade with a hardened receiver and perforating mag.
---
Lever is pretty good imo. Especially if you can get a good legendary effect on it. It's down side though is small ammo magazine
---
I lock my water purifiers, just so they can slowly fill up while I'm grinding without anyone stealing them, ready to sell to a train station. Usually only use lvl 1 locks though, cheap enough to lock.
---
So basically make the SPECIAL cost of those cards free.
---
Let’s just ask them to hand us everything! Seriously though is it really that bad? I play for hours each weekend and I never hit the limit. The game isn’t meant to be farmed it’s meant to be played. This isn’t supposed to be your primary legendary source. It’s supposed to make you feel like you have a chance to get something out of all those bad drops. 
---
Chill children
---
I actually have an auto AAE combat rifle.  Maxed out tank killer.  It does about 150dmg per shot and I can bust off a half a dozen rounds in no time.  The distance and accuracy is pretty decent as well.  I have 5 handmade rifles as well all different varieties.  My favorite weapons in the game due to build options and versatility.   The weight thing is annoying through
---
50 characters.  That seems to be the limit.
---
I got lucky and found an Anti-Armor LMG42, and while it shreds most enemies I still have to fire in bursts to avoid that insane recoil and wasting shots (I don't use my PA much so Stabilized isn't a common card for me to carry). 
---
I usually run about farming for lead and using Ammo Smith+Super Duper. That and keeping a nice rotation of weapon load-outs makes sure I don't run out of ammo for it.
---
There was a scene of a World War 2 uniform gear set in Fallout 4 Intro. What are you talking about that people will be triggered by it? That's childish.
---
Lever action, if not handmade
---
Well damn. I am happy I have the mod that highlights enemies (being colorblind this is stupid useful) but I can't use it lmao. Welp, guess it's just a waiting game
---
Gotcha. Vending doesn't have any effect on that. Real world sites that exchange items for cash are focused on high end weapons. This is probably one of the main reasons that dupers dupe. These websites need a steady stream of items and caps to sell. Vending is way more focused on low star items and junk/plans/mods/chems.
---
200 is a good number. It's one of those numbers with many factors.
---
got me...
---
I should have read the whole post... pardon my short attention span ;P
---
Switching to your point, I guess you'll have to loot Mothmen before they turn into ash piles.
---
yep so getting tired of bethesda's bs
---
That totally depends on your playstyle. I live in PA (HW user) and go through cores very slow with zero perk support. . But I don’t do much of the activities that drain cores rapidly- I don’t melee power attack, I rarely VATS, rarely sprint, rarely use jetpacks.
---
The only datamined stuff that’s left is like 5 more versions of the ratty grunge one they just added and there’s one curly bun style.
---
does your rifle have +250 resistance while reloading as third effect?
---
I hope they will add a Automaton like dlc for 76
---
I'd love to see a "full proof" plan in this game
---
I got 10 3* melee weapons first day, they were all bad and I scrapped them all eventually. That same day I got one more 3* but ranged this time. It was a bloodied gauss which is great for my bloodied build. Got three shitty armor pieces over the next few days, but then I got a two shot exploding black powder pistol. I’m loving that little hand cannon
---
You could always run a different helmet and mod that one, for now?
---
Umm, you already can with the intelligence perk, Robotics Expert, something like that.
---
Jup.
---
Made a post, got ignored. Wrote under another post, got downvoted. Typical behavior here in this sub.
---
This is definitely not a visual bug. 
---
If you set the price for an item to 1 cap, you get 0
---
Then I may need to cut down on one or two... at least I can plan now. Does 50 characters take up much build limit?
---
My guess would be when vault 94 (?) opens. If i remember right it kinda had a overgrown vegitation vibe.
---
Aye, that would work. Along with picklock &amp; hacker.
---
cool, thanks man
---
I discovered something, pets are HOSTILE to other players. I had to kill someone's pet cause it attacked me for coming to buy from the vending machine.
---
On my way out of Vault 76 one of the Robots said "once i was an adventurer like you, but then i got an arrow to the knee". Very nice eso reference
---
yah i saw that i was stoked
---
Just did scorched earth. Amongst all the chaos someone threw a grenade and amongst all the bodies that went flying I spotted a tick so stopped what I was doing and ran to photograph corpses. Challenge finished!
---
Now to do it in the other account.
---
I don't want to devalue luck or the grind behind a great trade.
---
At least a bed, if you’re going afk get well rested bonus?
---
I take workshops from people and steal they're junk, also made some good friends by doing this
---
Thanks, was going off memory and the wiki I looked at was also incorrect in an entirely different way.  I knew Strangler Bloom had been removed as a crafting ingredient, just wasn't sure which drink or what it was replaced with
---
Not really from what I can tell.
---
I honest to God couldn't figure out the maze for the life of me. I found all the numbers on the wall but I couldn't get them in the right sequence so I never unlocked either passcode door. That camp alone was more hype than half the dlc so far lmao
---
Ghoulish can have it's moments. It's great in nuke zones as you have permanent healing. It's also good for fighting scorchbeasts without PA.
---
I believe so. It doesn’t show as the outfit has a back thing already. When I used my damaged suit the other day after I took it off my backpack was still equipped. So I think it does. Didn’t pay attention to my carry weight at the time though
---
World hop it's spawn, eventually it'll be lv 50.
---
I mean yeah, simple solutions lol. But it's more about using that armor set, plus I've tried to do the modification on other helmets but it doesn't appear that I have that mod for the other helmets :p
---
Same, super rare now though.
---
It's still active even after dropping a nuke
---
What about 2 shot ÷ 10% missle launcher level 50 aswell? Any good in grand scheme of things?
---
I smell communism. Someone call Liberty Prime!
---
Marching Blue Stars this season! Hopefully it’ll be fun!
---
It’s not 50 characters but a limit of 50 lights of any kind.
---
This.... but I can't hate on the combat rifle for accuracy, low recoil and , importantly, ammo availability.
---
No, I have 25% AP reduction on vats, and anti armour
---
The one respawn location is bad. Sometimes it gets worse though, you literally can't click anywhere on the map and need to close to main menu then reload into a game server.
---
Would explain all the graphical glitches I get...
---
I feel dumb now, thanks. Been trying to buy mods for so long now, had no idea
---
My thought was fusion core and plasma core weight. And the ideal that they would be endgame items. Also being that majority of players use ballistic ammo.
---
Also : "tittle" 😂
---
Good luck with your hunt. I've been hunting legendaries for months and the Purveyor has been a blessing.
---
Harpers Ferry, the Burrows, West Tek, and of course the Whitespring are by far the best spots because of the density of high level spawns. I'd recommend avoiding mole miners if you want max gear because they will only drop level 35/40 gear.
---
*Laughs in -100% fall damage armor legendary.*
---
We aren't the monsters. We are murder hobos.
---
Yeah, annoying thing
---
Love this idea!! 🍬
---
The fact on the main datadase terminal of vault tech headquarters in d.c. says 76 is a control vault set to open after 20 years and that was from fallout 3.
---
Don't feel dumb, I think it's relatively new.
---
No no no, it's obviously better that we have to spend time constantly switching out perk cards every 5 mins for each mundane task we have to do.
---
Seriously though, this system is ridiculous.
---
Honestly, every time I spawn inside someone's foundation, it's because the person placed their actual CAMP somewhere it shouldn't be, like under a floor piece or glitched into a foundation. Maybe people should just place their CAMP in a place that isn't awful, since CAMP placement affects where you spawn.
---
Yeah... I've got like 5000 rounds of .45 ammo for my combat rifle.
---
I'd prefer a Homemade, but I've got a 3 star two shot VATS enhanced rifle that can headshot enemies from quite a distance, so I'm stuck with it. Can't seem to find anything better. Of course, I haven't really looked around since player vendors were inteoduced.
---
Bash it with the syringer after you get its health low with a normal weapon.
---
What I wish is that there was an external section outside of servers that would post and be searchable for all items currently in vending machines from players online. You could then search for what you want and then connect to the according server. A fast travel later and you can then buy the item.
---
Huh, interesting. Thanks for the info!
---
What if...and this is truly crazy...what if, upon investing fully in a "utility" perk, you can do a quest to learn to make a poster for that perk with endgame materials.  
---
Upon placing the poster it produces a buff in your c.a.m.p. that applies that perk to anyone using your workbenches.
---
Ah.  Ok.  That makes more sense.  Thank you.
---
You think so? You don't think you accidentally dropped the gun. I lost my best chest armor believing it just disappeared several months ago. But now I'm almost positive I accidentally dropped it because two times I have caught myself dropping stuff. First It was a favorite marked item so got a warning. Second time some junk but did notice it and just turned and picked it up again. It happens because I'm a VATS build and cancelling VATS is the same as entering the menu, circle button. Or trying do navigate fast thru the menu and unfortunately the game is not so responsive and sometimes it's laging or stuttering so I accidentally barely hit the square button (PS4). My tips is to always exit the menu from junk at least not from weapons or armor and to mark valuable items favorite.
---
I want a print of this
---
That's nasty
---
That would be cool if it is... I’ll have to try it on my next build!
---
You must be new on the internet then... There are tons of "journalists" writing bs articles... 
---
If you want proof search about pewdiepie wearing "nazi" uniforms... The thing he wore was a British battledress.
---
Don't underestimate the greediness of people dude. People will write anything for some clicks. 
---
Then you can't honestly compare Fo76 to Fo4. One is online, the other is offline. Having people wearing the same uniforms; especially WW2 ones and ganging up on others can and will definitely be abused. 
---
Wolfenstein, Sniper elite they both show some edgy symbols but that's offline. Put that into an online game and give people the chance to wear something and they will do it.
---
I’ve got a furious swing speed agility powerfist from a total of like 10 3star rolls, so its possible to get good stuff.
---
I have an executioner's, +10 aiming I love. I'll even put a .38 rcvr on it and go plinking when I get ammo overload.
---
The production terminal also sells X-01 Military Paint plans... oh yes!!
---
That's a very nice gun you got there. Was asking cause +250 resistance effect negate bloodied effect which ain't the case here it seems. 150 damage is indeed a bit low for a gauss rifle
---
I don't even lock my resource generator! I don't have vending set up yet and my camp is in the middle of nowhere in the savage divide, so if anyone find it and wants some lead then they are welcome!
---
I tried... but they split in a 1000 little pieces... the 'container' kept blinking in and out of existence while I frantically mashed 'E'.
---
Which makes it even more frustrating... I saw the fucking wing! aaaand it was gone.
---
For most players, it's going to be Heavy BOS Combat Armor.
---
If you're like me and run the Scorchbeast Queen in Unarmed melee though, you'll appreciate the built-in rad resist of Marine Armor.  To counter her constant rads, you need to get your rad resist up to about 100.
---
Had a weightless bat once, came to 0
---
It seems far more plausible that a game studio needs to add new creatures to a new iteration of a franchise in order to keep the player experience fresh and entertaining.  They also added local appalachian cryptids and mole miners, along with radtoads, mutated squirrels, possum, rabbits and beavers, which should exist pretty much everywhere else in North America, but they're just newly designed creatures that weren't invented by the developers yet.  Fallout 5 will likely have even more new creatures, depending on the setting.  We might see Thunderbirds and Chupacabra in a southwestern setting, or Sasquatch and radcougars in the Rocky Mountains.  (I shudder at the thought of a mutated mountain lion.)  The scorchbeast as a local species specific to Appalachia makes a lot of sense.  Bats like caves.  Fallout's WV has lots of caves, lots of abandoned mines and ultracite veins, which may be a very rare fantasy mineral that can only be found in quantity in very few places on the planet.  Maybe that's why other bats in the Fallout universe stayed relatively harmless.
---
We don't have cazadores, night stalkers, gecko or bloodworms in 76, probably because they're not native to the region.  I guess bloodworms could work, but I'll be happy not to have even more burrowing awfulness to fight.
---
With all of these vault dwellers killing every scorchbeast they can find in Appalachia, it doesn't surprise me that people living hundreds or thousands of miles away would have never heard of a scorchbeast 200 years later.  I get a feeling that the scorchbeast reign is essentially "over" after the queen is killed, but because we play in a persistent, online world, it needs to be "looped" to some degree.  If the scorchbeast queen was never seen again and all the other scorchbeasts and scorched died off after the first Scorched Earth event was completed, the world would be rid of scorchbeasts before the game even officially launched.
---
Establishing a contemporary timeline in a persistent online MMO-esque game just isn't possible.  They could possibly phase out the scorched and scorchbeasts gradually over time as the game evolves, but I don't see that happening.
---
Yup! I tell everyone that and also let them know if someone comes just get outside circle which I believe (not 100% since update) that as long as you’re out of the circle of workshop you’ll be safe. 
---
Lower levels can literally farm just as much in many places if not more!
---
yes. its just an insanely low chance
---
Still, have been hitting the bunker vendor only, even after they added in the others, never checked. Just so used to the old way.
---
I stopped by this one last night. A well done build indeed.
---
LOL. Scorchbeasts I hunt. I do that in Bos Heavy Combat and use a Lever Action and a Combat Knife. 
---
 Three is fairly normal but dropping them so you can get them all in a screener is tricky. ;)
---
Psa I started rifle until like lvl120...if you are past the point where ammo is a concern, equally perked commando definitely has an edge in my opinion.
---
Have you tried camp Adams? Sometimes there is clean fatigues there...
---
Just buy duped weapons on reddit or Facebook for caps. Everyone else already has.
---
I used this, too. I shot it to within an inch of its life with a combat shotgun then used the bleedout syringer to finish it off. It took about four darts to chip away at the final health.
---
My thought was. By the time the West Coast BoS come on their exodus east they passed through Appalachia and picked up anything that survived in that 150 plus year gap. If anything survives. As enclave from the west and Central America wasteland didn’t do that.
---
Yeah, I just picked up the first rank of commando... just need 8 more levels. -_-
---
I don't. I'm posted up by Site Alpha and I've always been kind of a pit stop for folks headed into the silo.
---
I should build a wall though, I moved at one point and since I moved back the Yao Guais have been spawning way more consistently
---
At the lake where you take the swim test there has been some and also the wolf pack event area.
---
^this. I had the same prob with my coal deposit did this and fixed it
---
I suspect E3.
---
Although it also wouldn't surprise me if Nuclear Winter was kind of *it* for the summer.  I'm not sure if they plan to keep up this new-thing-every-week deal.  There will be the high-level Vault raids, and the new features indicated by a smiling Vault Boy with a crown (the currently locked Presidential thing at Whitesprings?), but "New Quests" aren't advertised.
---
Only reason they are so bad is because they have a completely bugged range of melee that is longer than their entire body. I have marsupial with strange in numbers and at the height of my jumps the Yao Guai can still hit me with their charges and normal attacks which they should be unable to do; it's complete buggy b.s
---
Thank you, I will still try this even though there is a console difference
---
Also, just in case, Rose's syringer doesn't count as a syringer
---
The only drawback is I stopped using my instigating dragon 😭
---
Better yet; "I was a smoothskin like you, yada yada yada..."
---
If you’re not happy with you’re weapons, playing a slot machine to get a specific item that fits your specific play style isn’t likely. Find what you’re looking for on hear and trade for it. Or if it’s too expensive now, start trading smaller items to build your capital. 
---
I used a 1* gauss for 100 levels before I found an upgrade and was doing just fine. You don’t need a god roll to play the game.
---
If you're on PS4, you can come check out Floopwoods. We have two vending machines full of 3 star weapons. No armors but why waste your time with mole mama when you can find a real legendary vendor?
---
“Role playing a 6 year old”?
---
I’m Chris Hansen from Dateline NBC. Why don’t you have a seat over there?
---
Well at least I know a use now for the 50+ propaganda flyers I have on my character.
---
I believe an alien event/dlc could be down the pipeline
---
Rust youtube content is some of the best, I watch it daily.
---
Nope... only have water and I don’t care if anyone takes them. They can use the benches and anything else.
---
Think that's from mirelurk spawn/hatchlings IIRC.
---
Just do free range
---
What makes you think so?
---
I know Fallout 4 had a thing where the load speed was capped by framerate, and the framerate was capped for physics, so it led to this obnoxious deal where it would take 40 seconds to load an area that could otherwise take 4 off an SSD.
---
As far as I know, though, Fallout 76 fixed that.
---
I'd like it if all armor/weapons sold for scrip in multiples of 5.
---
Then we wouldn't have any of this weirdness with scrip limits.
---
They’ve written them as a conveniently isolated branch of the BOS. The only group that knew about them was the original BOS, and after another 100+ years, it’s easy to imagine that the relatively brief, remote contact that was had would be long forgotten. 
---
I also imagine that future generations of Wastelanders only know Appalachia as an uninhabitable radioactive hot zone. Several years of Vault 76 residents showering the region in nukes would do that, and leave no explanation behind.
---
You can't expect to get the exact something you want from a slot machine. chances are like 1 out of million. Your best bet is trading your drops for something you want
---
Which bunker?
---
Yes you can
---
I was deliberately trying NOT to do that.  That's the point.  I get by just fine with what I have, but the more time goes on, and the more 3*s I kill with 1* wooden arm drops, the more I need to vent about it.  It's not like i cant 1 shot almost any nor.al mob with 1 swing of an axe i dont even spec into...i can.  I just want to not HAVE TO do that every time it gets hairy..
---
I hope we get a Pumpkin/Jack'o'Lantern pack similar to the potted plant pack of the pumpkins from the Pumpkin House
---
I just like to use explosives/missiles/any explosive to absolutely _YEET_ any corpses I find.
---
I kept one weapon and returned 3 others and 2 armor so far..
---
I didnt really build up much scrip to begin with
---
The crowned Vault Boy is the thing with "becoming legendary" I think.
---
Shoot at the escort vertibots to get the aggro and the cargobot should start circling...aim for the thrusters...vats helps once it's aggro
---
Look around. I'm not saying they are all duped but the ratio of rare weapon ownership to drop rate is way way off.
---
You need to die all the way. That's what my teammate did. And I've seen others discuss this bug and they did the same.
---
Just stash your junk, die, and respawn. It's quick and painless.
---
Wait... why does the yao guai have a syringer?
---
We really need some back. Something fierce
---
It isn't a dev room item. Well it is and it isn't. It was accessed via it, but the reality was the helmet was supposed to be in the prize pool for some quests or events (can't remember which) and the code bugged out so it never dropped it. They even stated that it is supposed to be available.
---
I have like 12 royal jelly yet when I try to make the meatball grinder it says I have 0. 
---
I hear there is two different types called the same thing... not sure where to get the right one.
---
I don’t have any guns that can hit it unless I’m close and whenever I try to get close it goes away super fast
---
Joining now.
---
Because 9/10 players I trade with have the same 2* TSE handmade lol. 
---
Everyone owns some duped equipment.
---
_*GAY*_
---
The last I knew, only with the Meat Hook.  The Meat Hook, which was technically an Unarmed weapon, could double-dip with Gladiator and Iron Fist.
---
They do but it looks to be rare. I just completed the irrational fear event and got 1 from 12? beasts.
---
Are you going to leave V9 as a safe zone, or do I need to equip some rad protection?
---
A wishful guess. I cannot remember if there was a "Bethesda introduced" greenhouse building plans in Fallout 4. I know there was a mod for it, and it was great. But, I'm right there hoping with you too. I know that from Bethesda days in Boston, they get a lot of ideas and feedback from this Reddit and I hope they see this. I was just suggesting glass walls, roof, etc, but Milleh273 had a great idea in actual greenhouse control to simulate climate.
---
Just as an add on. Tricentenary with the Nukashine helm on looks so good!
---
Yup, this is what worked for me.
---
I'm not killing myself for a broke ass camera
---
Well no shit lol.  I dont expect perfection, nor do I count on a machine to love me.  But if it got any farther from my wants, I would be getting drills...like I do from Uranium Fever every 3 runs.  I have tried trading, i have tried server hopping and looking at every vending machine i can, and i haven't gotten dick.  So I felt like venting.  And here I am.  And I feel better.

---
You can get the fatigues and army helmet at Camp Adams along with the back-pack with shovel from the atomic shop would look somewhat like it.
---
Not really. It's true that there are many people with duped weapons, especially the ones that are actively trading, but I don't have a single duped weapon in my inventory.
---
Good point, could be the prestige system.
---
Just out of curiosity, does it make a difference using the actual PipBoy versus the quick menu?
---
Hell yeah I'd love Halloween themed PA!
---
I kind of wish we got a Zetan styled Expansion like Mothership Zeta in Fallout 3, but in Fallout 76's style where the content is spread out over a few weeks.
---
Upgrades for Alien/Space themed stuff, and new gear altogether.
---
Make the Alien Blaster as modular as a Laser weapon, so it can be converted to a rifle or shotgun or whatever, and add it to the Legendary pool. And buff &amp; fix ALL the Energy weapons.
---
Are Mothmen not dropping Torn Mothman Wings anymore?  I swear, I've killed 3-4 of them and not a one dropped.
---
Good bot.
---
The quest tranquility lane.
---
I don't think it started in Appalachia. Some of the holotapes indicate tagardy was in contact with roger maxon (founder if not mistaken?) Out on west coast.
---
 This was an extended branch. They were in radio contact when the first nukes hit and sometime after until infrastructure fully collapsed and further communication was impossible. Then tagardy had to make her own decisions without maxon, leading expedition to the glass caverns and end of BoS in Appalachia.
---
GT by chance? That sounds awesome! I love the creative minds out there making the wasteland a cool place!!
---
Yesssss. Everytime I see those decorations like at Freddy Fears House of Scares I get sad we can't use them.
---
Slightly off topic, but are camps without a vending machine still visible?
---
Your camp is looking a little red there freind...
---
Mothership zeta in 3 was amazing, I'd love to see more alien content and since we've had like 2 games released since then i don't think it would be redundant
---
There are 2 places on the map to get it as they are in a jar not the beast. One is the cabins West of Blackwater mine in a box behind the West cabin. The other is Tanagra town on top in a bathtub. The next day go back to get the third you need
---
I have so much fucking Halloween candy, idek why. Please let me pass it out to players.
---
Also, can we have a height scale like skyrim, distinguish the baby vaulties from the adult vaulties. Give the kids extra candy.
---
I would agree with this.
---
Also ballistic also weighs almost nothing so having three ranks would never feel like an upgrade.
---
There are small machine vendors at both the main scout camp and the CampFire tales event place. The one at the main camp is right next to a posting board outside.
---
Honestly, player vendors are a vastly better source for quality Legendaries compared to Murmrgh... but until they fix that damn Inspect bug, you're at the mercy of whether or not the owner decides to show up.  I'm not a fan of the new "Try to figure out what the 3\* mean" minigame. 😋
---
Or maybe just have us create a build for being out and about and for crafting. If it's just for crafting purposes, let us do it.
---
Wow, what a twatish comment. I'm sure in real life, you're a thoroughly splendid person.
---
I am back on now please message me if you are on thanks
---
Nope, several tests have been done. Their is also a youtube video on it. Unfortunately doesnt kill her, seems to just restore her health. 
---
However if you've killed her already you can immediately spawn a new one with a new launch back to back.
---
Thank you that works! So for anyone who kind of this bug unfortunately you have to kill your character and have them respawn.
---
I’m sorry. That’s just some straight up filth right there. Hopefully there wasn’t anything too valuable or hard to replace in there.
---
Kinda like the other day I was cleaning up some small stuff with my minigun right as the event ended, and some dumbass ran in front of my line of fire right after everyone doing it together had agro turned back on. Then he waited until everyone was done looting, then killed me and stole my junk.
---
It’s like if you just want to be a dick, do survival mode. That’s what it’s for. Stop trying to find ways to exploit adventure mode to fuck with people because you’re a sad person who desperately wants attention.
---
I like the idea of the shotgun. That DR reload makes fighting off swarms more manageable.
---
They do. I killed one got one. Pure RNG.
---
Maxing stats, stacking buffs, and using God roll weapons doesn't make someone good at pvp. Quite the opposite, actually.
---
I stay in my camp and don't really play anymore, F76 has become a merchant sim for me. That's why I tried to make my camp feel more like a town
---
This is it chief 👍🏽 I love it!
---
I already have the camera but I need to revive someone as well, if you too would like to die in some water
---
Unless your a ammo trader. Or want to feel like it’s a fallout single player.
---
campfire tales at the end
---
Not really and they should remove every duped weapon from sellers and buyers.
---
I was just thinking of building something like this yesterday, a kind of parkour course within winding hallways so you can’t jump on top or out of the course. I also discovered that you can make floating columns using the atomstore decoration column. Was going to put a vending machine at the start with marsupial serums and a neon sign that said to use one before you try if you dont have it. But then I realized I haven’t got the neon letters or that serum recipe yet. I can probably make it to where it’s only doable without marsupial and just vend rad-x at the start and use small lettering kit though.
---
It is also why the legendary vendor is essential .... you are guaranteed the type of drop and the number of stars (though I am doubtful that it is as "random" as it claims either.  Too easy to manipulate the randomness with a computer operated random generation).
---
Great idea, now I can do something with the 700+ pieces of Halloween candy in my inventory!
---
I’m more than willing to give it the old pioneer scouts try.
---
I agree, armor pieces being invisible would be my choice as that would allow you to still show the pieces you liked without having to cover the under armour completely
---
I think the raider vendor in whitesprings has some. He's in one of the shops with another whitesprings vendor, can't remember which one.
---
There's junk and there's aid.  Junk is... Well junk. Aid is used for recipes. Stupid.
---
I fast traveled to some guy's camp and immediately fell through the geometry, died suddenly and dropped my stuff. went back to see if it would happen again and it did again. i walked to it instead... door locked. didn't lose anything of import but annoying the same.
---
Yeah you're right. Also RIP Tahgerdy. She was a great leader.
---
For the actual armor, not mods.
---
I thought it was some bug because of the last patch or whatever
---
Hell let's talk about the closer holiday where they better do something. 4th of July. If they dont do something huge I will probably send them a very aggresive email and cry in the corner
---
I used to never have issues until the player vending machines, now mobs constantly destroy my generator and idek why but I better move my camp and set up turrets or something. Locking the door helps but they just destroy my wall. They really hate generators
---
Yes please I need for a prime receiver on my explosive quad shotgun.
---
This does apply to the Rider skins. But the other ones are paints.
---
Laser rifles are just terrible. Even with furious or two shot they are so weak. Their durability is a joke as well. The '"buff" they got wasn't near enough. They need at least another 10% dmg increased and the durability doubled again.
---
And yeah explosive lasers do good damage but you shouldn't need a specific modifier that doesn't even drop any more to make a weapon useable. Not to mention it makes them break so fast. And I mean *very* fast, it can lose an entire health bar in 5 or 10 minutes even with rank 5 Gunsmith.
---
I’ve got a nice quad lever action. Very sweet. Need to get the silencer for it.
---
I'm guessing it becomes available with Project Paradise.
---
Kill it 99.999999% with a sledge hammer and finish it with a syringer
---
Server hoping is a thing, an unfortunately nessisary thing
---
How do you learn the plan without reading it?
---
The .50 cal receiver boosts the damage from a hunting rifle quite a lot. It is almost comparable to the gauss rife in damage.
---
&gt;Like 5 -10 minutes more
---
Wow!!
---
Berkeley springs near harpers ferry
---
If Skyrim stared as the result of a misc task in the middle of a Fallout game I wouldn't be upset or disappointed.  Todd Howard would have gotten me again and earned it
---
I found the Fixer plans in someone’s shop for 160 caps and made a level 50 one to try it and.... I really rate it. Ammo is cheaper than handmade and it has comparable rate of fire and as a stealth player.
---
Have you tried the harpers ferry vendor?
---
I hope people joined you. Even so thank you for posting this. (I'm on pc btw just wanted to thank you)
---
Yeah those ghouls sliding across the ground scared the bejeezus out of me today on my first time in Fort Defiance
---
Judging by how Aliens are in challenges, in the files, and in the guidebook, I'd like to believe they're in the short term future.
---
Have fun!
---
are you still there? Ill join
---
So...Where is the body?
---
Dont insult the mmo farmer with your mouth full
---
Confirmed, everything is there now.
---
I am yes. Just enjoying the rides at the water park.
---
thank you, this is the only thing that worked on both of my characters
---
You’re the best, I’m on my way
---
I don't see it fitting a theme, judging how WV is THE civil war state and all, but I think the army fatigues could work as a replacement. That would be cool, so here's hoping.
---
Pistols kinda suck, extreme perk bloat.
---
The BoS started before the great war?
---
Oh no world is full! If anyone could leave after they get the camera that’d be great!
---
I would kill for spear mods, caz I have a BSS Spear
---
Buy a lottery ticket rn
---
That would be cool except for the fact that the corpses nothing but ash held together by ultracite.
---
It’s a shame you missed the message it was in response to, I assure you that it was thoroughly justified. 
---
Have a lovely evening.
---
That was quick work
---
Yes. Never seen raider power armor plans.
---
It’s okay, I’m not going anywhere just yet. Just keep trying and hopefully you’ll get in soon. Currently no one else this far up north.
---
But make sure it doesn't contribute to pip-boy games challenges. Also add a high score board.
---
I got to it just now.
---
😂 I was doing a WS run and had already encountered a few sleepy slidy gouls which looks hilarious. I moved onto the houses and had my first encounter with the incorporial goul. It stayed at the same level, moving through doors, walls and floors.
---
Gives me a chuckle but they really need to fix thier shit.

I completely agree, and it is frustrating. But I can't think of any other reason, supported by some evidence, that game play is being stretched in most aspects of the game. We don't really have any information about how well or how poor the Atom shop is doing, but since Todd and Pete have said in interviews that it will be the backbone that keeps the updates coming, I can only imagine that is where their focus is.
---
Also, before I get downvoted thats not to say you can't encourage Atomic Shop purchases and create great content. Unless the longevity of Fallout 76 is in fact not tied to the Atomic Shop like they said it would be.
---
South of the farm you first get to in the game
---
Yeah you have to own the games to play them
---
Np and have fun!
---
The BOS were the remnants of the former military before the war
---
Just run out before the game loads in fully.
---
This is a fair point
---
How do you all acquire so many legendary weapons? I haven't come up against the scrip limit at all yet.
---
Just curious, what weapon would you want from the vendor?
---
I got the same POS \*\*\* flamer two days in a row. to top off my day you can NOT use sugar bombs out of the food professors as an ingredient for say "Brain bombs" but that's OK after spending 2 hours setting up the workshop only to find this out the server crashed out anyways.
---
I farm Yao Guai's to bring the waste land the finest lemonade hand squeezed from them, none of that inferior yucky snally gaster acid here..no sir
---
I generally go with BOS for non PA. I think metal has more ballistic dr though.
---
Yep it does😂
---
Please please leave fertilizer on my bed. I make grenades with it
---
You can only do it if the camp owner is there. Hopefully they fix this next patch. Shoot the camp owner a message tho if you see something you're interested in. Most will come back
---
Yeah, if the CAMP owner isn’t in the area you can’t inspect the items
---
Great idea
---
They could do the right thing and drop 100 script per day into everyone's account until they fix it.
---
Like many have said before, pictures aren't shared by everyone and that would be hell to have to share them between servers.
---
He wants to be your soulmate.  I recommend relocation unless you want some sheepsquach-human babies.
---
Blocker= 75% damage redux from em
---
I'm onboard with this. I hated vats in 76 at first, but I couldn't imagine it any other way now. 
---
Feel like a gunslinger fanning that iron and clearing a room in seconds. Gun fu is awesome.
---
Yep, doesn't show over the suit visually but it does equip and work.
---
You must be fun* at parties.
---
*Fun, being an objective term, also lacks meaning by your standards.
---
Even if we had fast travel mats for camps we would all still end up spawning inside the geometry because the problem is not where you’re spawning but the fact that your character is spawned before your client has loaded and rendered the camp objects.
---
Oh that's lame lol.
---
Yea! Dam I couldn't think of it lol
---
That sounds wonderful.
---
Yes it helps, but it appears that the vendor suffers from the same tiny pool of legendaries to drop. I got two radium rifles in a row, one suppressors one junkies or something. I saw the same happened to a youtubers whe he visited the purveyor, two 10mm SMG in a row, only different prefixes. The chance is tiny to have two identical weapons in a row, if the pool covers all weapons.
---
Was it painted with an atom shop paint? There's a bug that causes painted PA pieces to get destroyed if they are broken.
---
Are you a ghoul now?
---
I'm not greedy.  Just a useful rifle.  ANY useful rifle.  A handmade with any useful perks would be swell, but I'd take a lever or combat too.   a medics flamer or medics gatling laser with vats accuracy is not close.
---
+karma thanks mate
---
True, but they can still be pretty nifty with a vats build. I love them personally. Have a great single action and an AA +50% vats critical 10mm that I've killed numerous SB's with :-).
---
Perhaps if you were a youtuber, you would get better drops.
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe your camp only shows up if you have a powered vendor station
---
Not yet
---
All I wanted was like a Ciri (Witcher) hair. My favorite mod in 4. :(
---
Damn, Ark sounds great.
---
I took a chance on a max level instigating powerfist with 40% power attack not knowing the third star. Alas...+1 Endurance.
---
Scout armor is good as well and it now has legendary pieces thanks to the purveyor. There are a bunch of them being sold around.
---
Yeah of course it is. I'd maybe leave the lootbag depending on the players level though.
---
I play this build.
---
Hit it with a regular gun, then gun bash it to death. Go to philipi battlefield cemetery for a low level Yao gaui
---
And I'm over here wondering if they've been working on the private servers they mentioned might come in November.
---
That would be a treat.
---
That would be awesome 👍
---
How would that work lore wise?
---
PC also.... I'm sure this was fully tested B4 release just like the rest of the game was. oh what are we still in BETA testing mode?
---
it’s all random but there is a video that shows some spawning locations
---
Just get a hunting rifle or 10mm and do it I have an two handed melee character that I had no problem with this. Even if your meleeor shotgun only you should have some sort of gun that can do ranged for these situations.
---
It's a super rare drop no matter what.
---
But it doesn't really matter since the version they drop is a Junk item, which isn't used in any recipes.
---
Only the Aid version is useful, and it can only be found as a static spawn in a basket behind the Northeastern cabin at Middle Mountain Cabins, and in a bathtub in the top of a house at the top of Tanagra Town.
---
It used to say “more damage against humans” but it doesn’t say that any more either.
---
Dayz alpha managed to do it lol. They look terrible at the moment IMO.
---
nor can you buy them from one of the WS vendors. I just kept checking the church at flatwoods until I got enough.
---
You get them from Savage Divide treasure maps I’m pretty sure.
---
Have you gotten a fat man before?
---
Have one in mine right now too. Someone will get it eventually.
---
thank you so much!
---
I went south of whitesprings near the snake icon on the map. There’s one sleeping in a cave, in my case it was only level 16. Took quite some shots with the bleed out syringer but apperently you just have to use the gun for the final shot..
---
Judging by the fact that the fall DLC is named "Dwellers" I'd wait till then and see if it continues from there.
---
That or use a bunch of perks, maybe 50, to exchange for one more perk slot, so if you saved 50 level-ups you can scrap them to add one more slot to your perks. This will greatly enhance the longevity of the game, people will play hard in order to earn more level ups and unlock more slots.
---
Are you sure you have all of the required materials for the lvl 50 version?  It will be frayed out if you’re missing even one scrap item for the craft.
---
I am on now, my ign is Rlauntz53
---
solid offer
---
Or a banjo...
---
sadly not possible, two shot and quad are both primary prefixes.
---
Hopefully this nonsense ends soon...we here at the Armory (just me) take care of our customers 👍🏻
---
So i am an idiot.
---
Yep would be nice to have the perk loadout manager thing that’s available on pc released on console by Bethesda
---
They've always had a pretty lengthy cool down. There was a theory that if you searched many you could push them down a list and force a respawn. I think I believe it.
---
Ex: I log in and loot the safe at Harper's Ferry. If that's the only safe I loot it seems to stay empty for a long time. If I do a circuit of locked containers around the world it will refill at some point.
---
It is insanely fast, and it has got worse. Why do people deny this?
---
I don't know but at least why isn't even showing up.
---
just switch to another window and it will load.
---
build them a barn with a keypad door
---
Oh gosh super sorry! My phone was turned off for a long time and never saw this are you still open? If not it’s fine it was my fault for not seeing the message.
---
Have you tried closing the game down and re logging in?  Also what platform are you on?
---
PA doesnt take any real perk sets to run, other than Power User. Also a tip: keep excavator on you at all times encase you become over encumbered, and note that T-51b is the best armor for defense as of now.
---
Not enough space sadly. My camp house takes up all of my budget. Plus I don’t have the keypad door
---
Agree with all the above, how hard would it to allow you to spawn into your intended target or at the very least a spawn mat for your camp like in FO4, I am now experiencing sudden screen changes when I am inspecting my stash it will suddenly close me down so I have to open the stash again same with some vendors, okay not a huge inconvenience but just another crazy thing to deal with and my food and drink is spoiling crazy bad to the point at least once a playthrough I have to go back to my camp to cook up more food and drink and especially if you fast travel a lot that seems to rob the time of the food, why!!!!!!
---
But what if the ultracite holding the corpses together was “inert” ?
---
What if we could “activate” it somehow?
---
Wrong. Very wrong.
---
Not at all, if I hadn’t have read the posts on here where folks were surprised their excavator, t51b etc armour was turning into XO1 and asking if it was a bug I would never have know myself, it never hurts to ask questions, I would have done a double take myself seeing that
---
That's a great gun! If you respec your character right, it could be insane. If it makes you feel better my first legit explosive found was like 2 months ago and it was an AAE pipe rifle.
---
Most of fallout 76 doesn’t work more wise. Brotherhood of steel, scorchbeasts nowhere to be found in other games and of course, ultracite.
---
Omg are you a torso with no legs or arms and a very blank expression? I’m sooo sorry that oropharyngeal airway was too big, I forgot to measure. It fit tho, right? Once it got jammed in there?
---
I seen the plan at Phoenix Bot a couple days ago. It's a random spawn.
---
depends on the legendary roll. a junkie's one would not sell for very much
---
Baa Baa sqanch
---
If that's all you are looking for then as others have said I would recommend trading. It's possible you will be buying a duplicated item but very unlikely if you are just getting something like a 1\* or 2\* rifle that's not one of the god tier rolls like BE and AAE. Most dupers are looking for real cash anyway and not caps.
---
I probably wouldn't be playing this game if it wasn't for the trading communities. For me a 1\* bloodied lever for 6k was all I needed for a long time.
---
Ask if you can team up and see if a teammate can kill your livestock. Find out where his base is, then nuke it. Alternatively, join on his server repeatedly and leave a bag with a propaganda poster, plunger, toilet paper, spoiled meat, fertilizer, corn, and a molotov cocktail in his camp.
---
free
---
Oooo thanks!
---
My biggest problems are spawns. One of my camps spawns alpha deathclaws, scorched, ghouls, supermurants, wolf packs, rad rats you name it.
---
Quad action!!! Very nice. My lever is an executioners. The silencer does help being a sneaky bastard 😁
---
That could explain it. There's really only a dozen or so that I loot. I'll try looting others and see if that helps.  Thanks.
---
Indeed you can, and artillery.
---
Oh I forgot until you said that. my buddy used the railway rifle to climb.  I didn't know the crossbow bolts worked the same way thanks
---
Get a lever action rifle and hip fire it. If you're not amazing at aiming, watch its movement, then place your crosshair where its gonna go.
---
It's a "feature"
---
I do enjoy a good bit of overkill with a nuke. I just wish he would get a bounty, so I could atleast kill him and make him go away. The worst part was he was like lvl 200 or something, so I doubt I could do anything against him
---
It’s the plan I forgot to add that to the title
---
If a guy called Col Gutsy pulls up in a panel van with a similar offer, run.
---
I don't have enought stash space for eventually.
---
ya i'm going for a long walk today it looks like
---
After they released that shitty game fallout 76 for full price they lost a lot of love from people.  That was a really bad move.  Also rage 2 just recently tanked and new elder scrolls is online only and look just like the old one lol.  They should've made a new bioshock instead of focusing on other stupid games.
---
BoS graveyard at the south end of Huntersville. Guaranteed three wolves every time.
---
Please Beth!!
---
Im encouraged about the future of this game when I see people that want to in est themselves and role play...I just like to run around and kill shit but good onya!
---
Do you Need help with the challenge? if so msg me back then we can  work out login time.
---
Yea if you could build on it your house would be taken with the nuke that flies out of there :)
---
It costs twice as much - but you get a higher rate back from the exchange machine. 40% versus 30% for 2 stars and 20% for 1 star
---
My GT or the person who made the maze camp? And it was 110% cool as fuck my guy
---
You have to do quest. They cant be sold, dropped or traded.
---
No i haven't. I play on pc. (I'm gonna try tomorrow. I'm tired.)
---
This is insane.  Some of these stupid tadpole challenges were not well executed.
---
Yes, you have do it and its a lengthy process but totally worth it. It can't be dropped or sold either sorry guy.
---
It goes to blue screen at least once in a play through now.
---
That sounds badass my friend. I'd say go for it and send me a PM once it's done so I can try it out! I have caps to spend too so throw a vending machine down and I'll buy some stuff. But put a machine at the end of the maze too for a free prize at the end! It makes the actual action of going through the maze/camp 100% worthwhile imho.
---
They can't be dropped or traded, you've got to do the quest which includes three tadpole badges.
---
It's uh for morale. Yeah! Morale! SUPER important to rebuilding the wastes. Yep.
---
Is that so? Maybe i should start streaming then
---
We can’t stop the upvotes then!
---
Aren't cows female?
---
*Make
---
i personally sell my plans for half of recommended value
---
I tend to under sell my stuff to help people out. But idk how rare this plan is either
---
Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work, you can always hit him with it.
---
That’s exactly what I was planning to do, if only I could load up the machine with 3star legendary items and limit them 1 per player. As it is now I guess I’ll have to restock it every time someone makes it to the end.
---
You can tag a recipe at a cooking station and it will flag all the correct ingredients with an hourglass ala the junk component tagging.
---
This might be a stupid question, but how did you scale down all the pawns, etc?  They look much smaller in your screenshots than they actually are for me, and I haven't found a way to scale CAMP items?
---
If your talking about build budget, having anything stored, in your camp takes up space and turrets take up the most space, I don't think that items in your stash effect build budget
---
"getting my toilet paper and eggs ready."
---
Wait until you get to the Possum stuff!
---
Happens to me all the time, things just don't load in for a few minutes and you can't interact with the world. But you will still take damage from enemies that don't exist on your screen, of course.
---
I do have one but I’ll try getting another one
---
Items don't respawn for areas you've looted recently, even if you world hop
---
Xbox?
---
I have a two shot I’m going to put in vendor for 50 caps so someone can play with it.
---
Sucks. Not much to do but try and kill her faster.
---
Yea I was being nonstop attacked and died when they finally loaded in, the only way I knew I was being attacked was my electrically charged mutation was going crazy and triggering nonstop
---
fshewwww fshewwww KACHUAINK! (Breaks)
---
Yeah, mine worked I think the second time after my post. The target that was killing me was the one with the body draped over it; I kept hitting one leg or the other and it wouldn't score (and then after 5-10 shots game would freeze). As you said, nighttime didn't exactly help...
---
 Overall, server was pretty glitchy/unstable last night, but for me that's always been part of the whole Fallout experience :)
---
The first one went well, so I just dropped another. See you all in 3 minutes...
---
Plant a razorgrain. Costs 1 razorgrain and 1 steel to repair.
---
How do you know? If you've bought or traded since launch you've probably got one.
---
I do. It’s the fact that wen I repaired it, the guy would just shoot it again.
---
I never even looted the area thats the thing. I freshly spawned in for the day and I wasn't able to pick up anything
---
I was reloading and the gun vanished from my hands, it was some weird ass glitch i think
---
I have to keep an eye on my health bar while that happens. You still see your health going down even though there are no indications of taking damage
---
Hey I’m down whenever you are!
---
Join us if you can!
---
It's only for you, not others.
---
You can sit on toilets in your C.A.M.P if you build one. It was just yesterday I was sitting on a toilet behind SAMS cafe
---
That seems to be the best way of doing it, at least from what I can tell. But you wouldn't even need to load it with 3 star legendaries imo. A couple of 1 or 2 stars work perfectly because you can turn around and sell them for caps or script if you win them.
---
Wait the purveyor can give ultracite gatling laser legendaries? I may have to swoop on by if so, I like green lasers.
---
Stabilized under Int. is a major one, accuracy and armor penetration

Thanks scorch beast

What enemies all have armor?
---
Crap i guess ill do it
---
Had one for a while cause i put it down in beta. Recently moved and now i can't place it. Only my team ever spawned on it while it was placed, and now it just sits in storage waiting to be used once there's a workaround or bethesda lets us use em.
---
There is an actual camera now. If you search the reddit for "camera tourist" you should get info on the quest.
---
You need a camera, search containers for the Broken ProSnap Deluxe camera and then repair it to start using it. You will also need to make film for it at a tinkers workbench.
---
You can also find the camera on a random encounter tourist but this is more of a painful way to get it. Originally this was the only way to get it.
---
GT to join up ?
---
Batteries included and Power user, power user if you have less then 10 fusion cores. batteries included if you have as many as i do.. 178
---
Did you loot it before logging out last? I think the respawn timer is ingame time, not real time.
---
You cannot always trust customer support. What they did confirm is that it's ok to have one, but if it's possible to obtain ingame where do you get it? Does anyone on console have it? 
---
The one players have on PC seems to come from the dev room and everyone shared it.
---
Would love a "get one random thing" vendor pumpkin I can put in my camps.

You can, you can sit in portable toilets also.

Stabilized in intelligence...there's one in strength that give +Dr. Bandolier and /or batteries included.
---
I wouldn't completely be opposed to that, but it would have to be really amazing aside for it's incredibly high ammo consumption to make the hassle worth it for anyone who isn't already invested in one.
---
If they do this, they need to be made impervious to mutation procs.

Easy 3 World Quests are

Swimming

Archery
---
Nope the last place I looted was Wes tek and the last place I was before logging out was in my camp
---
No change to DR. ER and RR take a -60 hit each. Yes, it sucks for pvp. You have to trat it like excavator armour and only wear it when you have to. Try to be in the armoured backpack all the time, then move up to standard and high capacity as you need the carry weight
---
"Critically injured"
---
A lot do, even if not for the armor pen. do it for the accuracy
---

---
almost everything at higher levels. and a lot at lower levels. if you use Awareness you can check an enemy's DR. anti armor effects make it so your attacks ignore X% of the enemy's DR
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Awareness](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Awareness)
---
Hmm would be interesting...I haven't seen it pop in quite a while though.
---
You sure you have damage upgrades on the gun?
---
I ask because my main uses a Gauss Rifle. And when only using Tank Killer it’s Damage is 140.
---
Something really needs to be done. To really make it viable, I think you need to craft about 10,000 rounds or more if you want to use it on any kind of regular basis.   I have an LMG anti armor, and I put a prime receiver on it just because ultracite yields 86 rounds per batch.
---
Why can't regular .308 yield that much too?  I mean, the .308 ultracite ammo works in sniper rifles with prime receivers too, and will go a helluva lot farther with the sniper.    86 rounds per batch is a shit ton for a sniper rife.  If they are so concerned about breaking the balance of the game, then why does damn hunting/ sniper rifle get four time as much of the most powerful ammo in the game?

---
But the post is about a newly purchased one
---
Please let us put whatever we want in the candy dish though. Not just candy.
---
I just got one today from the savage divide #4 map. But I turned in 12 and only got the one so they are super rare.
---
I use one guy army under luck as well. The stagger is nice
---
You're right! I can sit on portable toilet in my C.A.M.P. but does not give me the option to sit on regular toilet
---
I have the freezing issue when using aid items (or probably anything) in your PIP boy menu. And the crash to desktop one. The freezing one sucks because you need to hard quit.
---
You could use a power armor glitch to get into them, but few had anything of value. 94 has one holotape and generic loot, 96 has syringers, some special unused aid items called Metabolux syringe, and a note.
---
The last one, can't remember it's number rn, had just generic loot.
---
I kept one quad barrel vats crit for rate plasma for a mate, other than that I've scrapped 1680 scrip work of junk 2* armor and 3* ranged weapons. I stopped buying 3* pretty quickly, 2 good ones will be enough for me.
---
That's great but I'd rather they just fix the inspect bug.
---
And you can even close the door unless you want the whole world to see.
---
Mainly because I'm usually already well rested and well tuned, so why bother.
---
Just ate a burger with garlic grilled mushrooms, bacon and cheddar. At least you can re-create your ciw.
---
It's a good bot but he said "I'm **not** killing myself"
---
Yes they are rare the same as the T-60 parts are from Cranberry Bog treasure maps. I’ve done so many and maybe got like 2 plans out of 50 maps.
---
Im pretty sure what makes fallout fallout is moral decisions and living with them... :(
---
I just want a slower more damaging receiver for the gatling plasma. Something that doesn't need a sponge up and fires more like a gatling and not minigun. I have soo many cores.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Good looking out!
---
I did this same exact thing to a lvl 2 fresh out of the vault, I drank a nukashine and gave him some chems, ammo and all the known plans I have before we went our separate ways. Never saw him again I assume the yao guais got him.
---
Yeah....that might work sometimes but there are alot of factors at play with that.
---
There's a perk card that does that.  Look at what perks you have active.
---
I would think that since it is a loaded instance it wouldn't be effected. Just like the inside of whitesprings isn't.
---
90%+ chance to hit in VATS... misses, over and over again.
---
Pistols are ok, sadly Rifles and melee are too op right now. After 1000 hours of melee/rifles builds I found pistols the most balanced and enjoyable way to play this game
---
I don't.
---
Anybody else think Famine looks more like Death than Death?
---
the legendary effect "Auto Stim" makes you use a stimpak when low. medic pump does the same for power armor
---
More range = More loading objects = more lag?
---
Not a programmer so I don't know the specifics, but I'd guess the further away the gun CAN hit things, the more things need to be loaded in that can be hit, regardless of whether they are or not.
---
Agreed.  Assuming that they can do that. Of course I don't see why they couldnt.
---
You could have a piece of armour that has the auto-stim perk or you have the  born survivor perk card active. Take him off and you will be good to go. Hope I could help
---
With player vending I've been buying all my .308 from people who don't need the 3-8 rounds of ammo they pick up from each hunting rifle carrying mutant. I had trouble keeping up with ammo for it before but now I am always sitting on 5-7k rounds, topping up as needed.
---
We need more Civil War stuff in game. Like Union/Confederate kepis, guns like Remington revolvers,  themed posters, maybe things like a Civil War era 36 star flag.
---
You couldn't really know that for a fact if you've traded with other players or bought things from their vending machines.
---
On the other hand, I look at pretty much any TSE, BE, or AAE weapon as a likely dupe.  I've *never* come across one naturally in 500+ hours, which isn't to say it's impossible, but there are so many players that have them that it's clear they've been duped.
---
You might have a armor piece , or perk card that does that
---
No scaling. But some of the pawns are just mini statues!
---
Uh, but I have it at level 3 :)
---
Nice find!
---
It worked!
---
Deathclaws do not drop hides. They seem to be a rare container loot item.
---
i dont think it counts if you buy them..
---
im sure someone will chime in definitively...

---
Any plan I know already I sell for 10% of its value. They usually sell quickly. And I don't really care what they do with it .
---
Honey beasts still do occasionally drop _a type of_ Royal Jelly BUT that is "junk" jelly and can't be used for recipes like the berry honey crisp or whatever. 
---
To get the "food" jelly you'll have to go to middle mountain cabins. There's a picnic basket by a makeshift grave behind the eastern most cabin by the main road. If it's not there, welp you'll have to try again later. I've heard it can take up to three days to respawn. 
---
The other location is in a makeshift bathtub still in the house at the tippy top tip top tip of Tanagra town - the one at the other side of the cricket cave near the top. Go loaded for bear cuz those dozen or so crickets in that cave aren't messing around.
---
Good luck.

I ended up biting the bullet and spending the caps to FT all the spawns on 1 server..
---
finally got him at col kelly...
---
That is a kick in the Royal jelly balls
---
Deathclaw do not drop hides, unfortunately. My success has been from green footlockers, and others have reported gulpers dropping them too. I've found two in random footlockers, so hitting high density locations like Fort Defiance, etc (military type locations) seems like the best option until they patch it for deathclaws.
---
Same here. I need help with reviving in water
---
I had a guy yesterday, give me a two shot handmade. Super cool dude I ran into as soon as I logged in.
---
Nope, bough these a few months back
---
Yup. I got an ultracite laser pistol from her as well.
---
Best Answer : He's right, the broken pro-snap seems to appear in about half the toolboxes I check and other random loot boxes as well, repair at the tinkers bench and then make film at the same.
---
Glad you found it. Thanks, trying to press on but I'm getting genuinely sick of it. Trying to look at phone stuff whilst I do it but just getting annoyed now. Lol
---
There are many things that need fixing, for sure.
---
I'm sure they will work most things out, but it will take time.
---
Take your own advice and make a post that doesn't give me epilepsy because of your shitty grammar.
---
Nerf it to a third, for just a single week, and post on the news page.
---
"Still better loot than Anthem".
---
Then buff it back to normal and +10.
---
How much does a backpack weigh when in inventory? I use excavator power armor as a backpack. Store it in inventory (10 lbs) until overencumbered then bust it out and get 200 lbs extra carry weight to get back to CAMP.
---
Is that the best you have to say?
---
Hope its not a big camp good luck moving it
---
The cameras can be found in world now in containers like tool boxes. If you just want one for the dailys and scout stuff rather than the quest you can just do that instead.
---
Epilepsy given by flashing light.
---
It’s not my native language but thx
---
First attempt and I found it 😭 it's been months of searching. Thank youu
---
What' are they called? I don't get anything appearing in Tinkers Workbench about fixing cameras or anything.. Though I might have had to do some of the quest. I might have picked up a few.. But are they classed as Junk? Coz I scrap everything without looking.
---
Start by writing whole words.
---
900% down with this
---
Yis, wrong thing, my bad
---
Because I haven't bought any weapon from another player since release, besides a level 35 .50 cal machine gun. :)
---
And a special note next to it saying in all caps “I NEED TP FOR MY FATMAN...AND MY BUNGHOLIO”
---
I have had similar issues but with my Bloodied fire axe, where I’ll equip it and it’s dmg will not change but if I un equip and re equip it then the bloodied effect works again. So perhaps it’s a bug with the effect itself?
---
👉💀👉
---
Broken ProSnap Deluxe camera, I believe it's not a junk item and appears under a different category like misc. Not sure about that though. I've actually kept a spare in my stash in case I lose mine.
---
because everything visitors need (vending machines, crafting tables, food &amp; water, instruments) is outside of the home, and the only thing inside that isnt furniture is the power switch to the vending machines...
---
also no one ever spawned inside my home and i dont want them walking around my home without me showing them around myself!
---
I currently have 4 of them, 3 in base, 1 in my inventory for emergencies.
---
Not true. Interiors (other than Whitesprings) are definitely affected. I nuke Morgantown frequently for all the cobalt, and if you go into VTU or the airport you'll find max level enemies like glowing bois and scorched conquerors that have nuke mats on them.
---
I got to kill her yesterday, but she got me a surprise present, a facefull of insta death pit, and I brought my couple thousand caps worth of junk like an idiot
---
Thank you. Will check it out.
---
Hey it’s fine. And you made some good points I agree.
---
Uhm? what are you talking about? I mean that why is the Fallout 76's .45 smg's range so much weaker then the Fallout 4's smg's range?
---
I've done it once, only because the event had just popped up. The hard part is timing it so that you're at the console shortly after it goes live.
---
#1  If I'm understanding you correctly you can't see all the bonuses on legendary weapon/armor.
---
 This has nothing to do with your play time it has to do with whether or not the player you're buying from is at his/her base or not.
---
 If the player is at their base you can see all the stats. If they are not, you cannot.
---
So it wasn't just me... Those submerged ghouls are hard to kill when they finally appear after beating on you for 5 mins invisible.
---
Happened forever on xbox for me and mine
---
Firstly, make sure you have them added as a friend (if you’ve done it, check it anyway, I was friended and it was still busted)
---
Then you have to make sure you’re appear online, or it will not work
---
Lastly... make sure no-one has them blocked
---
It would be good if you got a notification for a doorbell even if you are not anywhere near your camp. Sometimes turrets don't kill spawned enemies. And they end up busting stuff because I leave it open for other players.
---
A quest hub should be around the spook shop or the pumpkin house. Man, I hope they do it!
---
I finally found the time to make a mod for PC with some of your maps: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313)
---
I left the maps with your watermark as requested.
---
That would allow for hella trolling if it had a real effect on players :p
---
No worries, you can repair it and make film for it at a tinkers work bench
---
Also we can just start saying ding dong. God that would be the worst. Ding dong, hellooo?! Said like gilbert gottfried
---
It has a probability of showing up at various Raider vendors too.  Check the ones in the Savage Divide, Sutton Station, and the Raiders Whitesprings Vendor too.  You'll come across it eventually.
---
Encryptid is on right now and we need more players! Anyone wants to join???
---
I got two 3* WOOD armor pieces today that turned into 1* pieces after the effects screen faded away.
---
Yep I actually noticed I seemed to gain more lol I just never ran out.
---
Still waiting on a Bethesda response
---
I always do that event when I see it.  Max level gouls and usually at least one 3 star. Sometimes multiple 3*'s.
---
 Would be even more fun if they were all glowing from the nuke!
---
”COMMUNISM IS A LIE”
---
I think the response was a good possible reason why.
---
IMO, the only reason you might want Marine is if A: Rad resistance is something you need and B: the Dense mod, which makes you all but immune to Scorchbeasts, is way more common for Marine Armor.
---
If you do your food should when "well rested" or another word for it..  but something else should go up as a plus side.
---
Sounds about right.
---
I sold 2200 rounds of .50 cal for 2000 caps, at 1 each. I assume this is an intermittent issue?
---
Maybe user milks their male cow?
---
My previously-thought little-know secret is out! T\_T lol Every time I've visited the Pie, it was there for me, so I assumed few knew of it. 
---
It's rare, but there *are* some locations that the map makers have rewarded those of us who climb, with ***some*** sort of loot. The building in Watoga with the broken sky-bridge that connects to the Municipal Center, on one of the not-easy-to-reach balconies is a... don't recall, it's either a First Aid or Chems Box. A small reward, but a reward nonetheless :) 
---
I miss that, with FO3 and NV (less common in FO4), with us being able to physically grab world clutter and move it. I made a point to move all the plastic and wood crates, as they'd often hide usable stuff like food, stimps, or ammo. Such a shame we can't "grab" in 76 :(  
---
\[/ramble\]
---
If only I could find a way to farm them.
---
I'd heal the world. Make it a better place. Provide deaty claw hides to the entire human race.
---
Oh my god really? Damn I didn’t know that. Anyway it’s super wierd
---
To keep mobs out.
---
I don't get it.
---
So are you saying that they nerfed the guns range because the longer range on it caused lag?
---
I’ve kept the forest scout pieces I received and I also got a assassins sentinel +agility leather leg from her.  The rest I have turned back in.
---
This is why I use heavy weapons, cuz they are way lighter than rifles. I can get a plasma gatling that weighs less then a hunting rifle with no stock and far more damage.
---
Sold a couple for 50 caps each. I don’t know if that’s cheap or expensive as as yet I have no point of reference lol.
---
Don’t get your hopes too high the neon letters are only one color. I was bummed out when I finally got the plans.
---
How much mistakes did I make? Show it’s to me and I’ll fix it. I think u came here for that
---
Do you have to do some world hopping in order to get the opinion for the mystery pick? I keep visiting her and she doesn’t have it listed.
---
3 spawn at White Springs bunker entrance. Just up the hill.
---
 That's the most in one spot I can think of.
---
WITH WORKING LIGHT!!!!
---
Please?
---
 And i have the same problem from patch with No 9, i do not know how to solve this problem :( . Observ that players  speak around me but i hardly hear them as if the volume is at 1%.
---
The game says the plan is worth 500 caps, so I thought I would ask here
---
Yep.  They are fixing that next patch they have already commented on it!
---
Such a pain. Some even do it in The Burrows. VATS is a good workaround but I personally run out of AP too quickly for it to be viable.
---
Hold up..... why did we have to wait for 7 months and do some really annoying quest to get a backpack when there was one in our room the whole time????
---
Then I definitely sold them cheap lol.
---
There was a group of super mutants west of Harpers up on the hill a few months ago. I was sneaking by the rail carriages about 200ft away from them and they somehow spotted me, not even caution, immediately into danger. They all had miniguns and were blasting me nonstop even from that distance they had godly accuracy. I think I was low on ammo or durability so instead of fighting I headed north past the hermit crab while taking a few potshots behind me, trying to cripple their legs.
---
These guys followed me all the way up to Crevasse dam, I lead them past the crab, past the church, through the robots at Dyer, I was well ahead of them but their red blips never disappeared from my compass and I never left [danger]. They ignored the robots and all other enemies and just tracked me incessantly, eventually I got pissed off and used the last of my durability to take them out with a bit of help from the other enemies nearby.
---
Main entrance or back entrance
---
I scrapped my first two, broadsider and assaultron head. Then got a furious gattling laser. Loooove it.
---
Both are viable and fun... For me it comes down to bullet efficiency. As a sneak sniper I can one shot most things, so that's generally what I use for farming. I use commando for when I want to change things up a bit.
---
I miss this from the previous FO games! *(or was it just NV? I can't recall...)*   
---
I've mentioned it to my friend a couple times as a matter of fact, so I'm all for it!
---
And while yes, the Challenges do keep a partial track of certain things, it's a PITA to look through. No where NEAR how easy it was in previous games via our Pip.
---
Simple idea but really smart! Nice one
---
Service entrance, just above on the hill.
---
I will destroy your home
---
Do you remembah? I membah
---
Pepperidge farms remembers
---
Well played.
---
I've found people are detonating less nukes overall, there have been some Whitesprings XP nerfs and Prime requires a lot of ammo resources for a less return on investment.
---
Yeah i love the game as well but the bugs man... the bugs...
---
I'm thinking it looks spot-on!  
---
I used a mouse/keyboard macro program to record a few sets of actions.  The first task is to search the FormID of RETriggerScene 0002DFE5, click "Referenced By", then click the "record" tab to sort them by name.  Then I have to manually double-click the next record before running the next macro, which simply copies the coordinates from the selected record into the list. Rinse and repeat for ~90 entries, and there you go!
---
I'll try to get started on the other types later tonight, so they can all be released at once. Thanks again, this is fantastic!
---
Do you not have more characters? (blizzard joke)
---
Quad and TS occupy the same legendary slot. Quad explosive is the big dog from what I've seen. I've given up on shotguns though.
---
My all time favorite. Just nuked the burrows, lvl 16 reg spooky bois. No glow, no legendary not a single fucking thing.
---
Commando is more dps, rifleman is more efficient. I run rifleman next to my friends commando pretty much daily. He does more damage, but I don't scrounge for lead and steel and acid every damn day.
---
I need this as well. EggLoPan
---
I'm pretty sure everytime you reload/swap it out it picks a random core to pop in. Carry less on you and see if that changes anything
---
Also a radscorp venom one that does a 40 poison damage as well.
---
Where'd you snag the DCG plan?
---
It's a scappable mod. I'd say 100 caps maybe if you don't want to grind to build/scrap handmades. 500 is way too much.
---
I've done that. Ran backwards straight into the fissure. Fully loaded. Then, worse, I could see my bag just down in the pit below the edge....and i fell back in trying to retrieve my loot. 
---
*Poors one out for all the lost loot*
---
Closed got it but glitched out done with fallout for today
---
Yes it’s annoying, and not immersive..
---
I'll help. Join my server and tell me which puddle of water you want me to die in.
---
This didn’t count for me either
---
nothing found :(
---
Thanks everyone who helped and tried
---
Join my server and msg me. I'll take one for the team.
---
Ah okay I gotcha.  I've got the VTU statue and the deathclaw hedge, and I see the mothman statue all over people's camps but I've never seen them that size before
---
Has this been happening for a lot of people?
---
Auto weapons are pretty awful these days. You used to be able to repair them to 200% and they'd get an awesome damage boost, but that's not the case any more. Now the low damage just makes them sad to use.
---
That is a nuke silo hatch.
---
Do you have the same issue when chat is set to "area"? That works for me now but is not exactly what I want.
---
Yeah I know that, I just like them a lot. Do you know if they’re sold as “neon letters set” or as a part of “signs and letters?”
---
I don’t know!
---
I'm on PC
---
In one of the 3 level 3 safes at pleasant hills cemetery in the ash heap.
---
I have this helm it's in the game
---
It does, found one in a random bag and scrapped it and it worked!
---
found them in junk piles and a toolbox
---
I would put up a wall on the outside edge of the floor, then put the roof on, and scrap the wall once I had the roof how I wanted
---
It's a plan, and it's a prime automatic handmade rifle receiver
---
Exactly why I don’t do that event any more waste of time resources and ammo
---
What platform are you on and how did you get?
---
Beach boys are a classic music group. Why hate on them?
---
I'd love this, as well as the ability to just plant the flowers and stuff we find all over. Or even just new flowers, if they want to avoid us farming our own bloodleafs or something. IDC. I just wanna plant pretty flowers for my camp. :(
---
Maybe I wanna go to the moon...
---
Unfortunately you can't repair it until you find the tourist and start the quest, so finding one in the world won't help :(
---
🙋
---
I know it's a plan, but you can scrap for the normal automatic receiver. The prime on is a very different story. 500-1000 caps might work out. I know a lot of people don't think the prime ammo is worth it though.
---
Yeah, that could be cool, too. Could bring a new layer of customization to late game builds.
---
I'm on PC if you're interested.
---
Just to help out a random stranger complete the revive player step for the backpack, right? Right?!
---
the bug occurs when you turn into gibs from an enemy killing you similar to when an enemy dies from the bloody mess perk but because you got down or the attack didn't actually kill you all the bloody skeleton bits that you were gonna explode into spawned and stayed inside your model. The imposter sheepsquatch did this to me the other day it used its melee attack and almost killed me but I used a stimpack and got really low instead then I had a bloody skeleton stuck inside my model until I died. The weird thing is I have never ever gibbed from dying in this game the only time I've seen a player gib is one of the trailers when they were showing off pvp for the first time and a player got his arm blown off and then died. So player gibing might be disabled or have a super low chance of happening?
---
Finally, I unlocked suppressor today! After 6 scrapped guns, without Scrapper perk (not sure, maybe this is important to learn mods). Sound is really cool now :)
---
Oh boy Dolly sods hu? Well you ain't messing around. Brave move!
---
Happy hunting - fingers crossed
---
Every game has a few problems but you're just hating on the game because its popular and because you watch youtubers who do the same thing! Your expectations are too high and you need to get off your high horse! It's objectivity a great game since I have fun with it which is why I spend my money in the atom shop, to support the developers!
---
&gt;!Parody!&lt;
---
Ahh yes, reminds me of this:

---
block, change server or just ignore because its a bloody cow
---
The trick is waiting, hoping, the camp loads; the treat is when it does. What more do you want for trick or treating?
---
It took way too long, but we did finally get the Gift emote.
---
Still want a "LOL" and a version of "No" that doesn't make you look like a jerk.
---
Lever Action has enough punch to get you through most encounters with minimal ammo expenditure.
---
During SBQ, I'd stick to mob clearing.
---
Care to make me one, friend?
---
:)
---
there is a gift emote? atom store or for free? didn‘t notice that one yet.
---
That's too bad
---
Up for fallouty!
---
Honestly surprised its not already a thing since its always Halloween in Appalachia lol
---
They all lower your carry capacity
---
Appreciate the info! I’ve been doing the wrong maps the entire time haha.
---
Thanks for the reply! My first Reddit post actually! I know it's no two-shot explosive but my first decent weapon!
---
That’s nasty. Sometimes I get damage like I don’t wear PA, very strange.
---
Tanagra town was an experience.  I'm glad I found it but geez that was miserable.  I'm jump/walk challenged and fell off several times.
---
It was both.  I think it's still free in the Atomic Shop.
---
It has been happening to me more frequently on ps4
---
The furious is nice. Your second blast to the same target will always do more dog
---
Yea good ole cat eyes, never liked it mub but it was def better than the scope in my opinion
---
I'd recommend Commando for PVP, as it's more likely to proc Tormentor (if they're not running Adamantium) and helps overcome dodgy.
---
PvE, I'd go rifleman for everything except bullet sponges.
---
And to add something I didn't see. If you use power armor with medic pump torso will have the same effect as the perk card or legendary effect on armor.
---
Name it "Overclocker"
---
FO4 had Rabbits and Chickens, so they aren't new to 76.
---
FO3's Capitol Wasteland, which is a stones throw from Appalachia and even referenced on a cottage door-frame (notes) just outside Vault76 for where there was a reported safe-haven for Ghouls, there were the 'Centaurs', which I kinda miss. Though, the Snallygaster is kinda close to it heh
---
My understanding of Bloodworms was they were found in saltwater, which 76 is not on the coast. The others, as you said, wouldn't fit the different landscape between NV and the East Coast (NM that I don't anticipate Bethesda would add anything from NV; I get the impression they see NV as the redheaded stepchild, or black sheep if you'd rather).
---
There's also the fact that the Scorchbeast could have died out from lack of food? \*shrug\*
---
Or it's as state: a Simulation or Hallucination, and this isn't reality.  
---
Maybe "Wastelanders" update is when we ACTUALLY wake up from whatever experiment we're part of, and truly venture into the Wasteland. That what we've been playing in 76 is some kind of controlled "wakeup" to prepare us. It can still be a Hallucination, just a controlled one, but not quite a "simulation" since we wouldn't be all connected via brain links. 
---
Yet, it *could* be a Simulation...   
---
Or it could be ***reality!!*** Who knows! :)
---
i think i got everything that was for free, but i‘ll check again. maybe i need to change the emote wheel
---
I wonder if the Flatwoods monster charmed the turret?
---
Same here I’m finding better stuff from random vendors and not her
---
Rumors?
---
As someone who loves to speculate, I appreciate your post. :D
---
New ish to the game, what the hell's a flatwoods monster?
---
Oh, have they?  That's good to know.  I look forward to not having to play the irritating "Guess the effects!" minigame.
---
I think I remember it being something about a BR game mode or something. Who knows
---
On PS4 and literally happens all the time
---
Awesome friend! You can celebrate :) you beat the end game. How many rifles do you think you scrapped in total?
---
Are you on PS4? Maybe you can try again somewhere else. I know a spot where I’ve killed my self several times to help others get their badges.
---
First things first, spoilers!
---
There has been datamined audio of a Zax that resides in vault 51 that points to PvP related modes like Team Deathmatch and, bad as it seems, Battle Royale.
---
I don't even have a mule but, it doesnt take long to farm up enough legendaries for that limit, especially since only some of the time you get something worth keeping from the preveyour (probably spelled wrong) and those trade back in for 40 each.
---
I'm actually surprised that you cited the examples you did.
---
When I think of epileptic things in this game, the first things that come to mind are the giant green Cheerios from the Scorchbeasts.  Or the Surface to Air event in general.  I wouldn't have considered the SBQ's cloud or the pylon sparks.
---
something in one of the recent patches started making it do this... it's awful
---
The Silver Shroud outfit with the Halloween Skull mask make good for a modern Death outfit.
---

This is my experiences with the issue. For me, I'm unable to just tab back to Windows (probably due to using a customized 1920x1080 that uses a refresh rate unsupported by my TV; 65Hz) because I just get a black screen. Thankfully I'm tech-savvy enough to blindly End-Task on it with Task Manager.
---
It’s a cryptid monster that can charm nearby targets. They turn a purple color and become hostile if they where not before.
---
Wtf is a bitch boy?
---
For me on PS4 quiet frequent and a daily annoyance. I hope they gonna fix it some day.
---
Worst is the mire when it looks like trees where bright/dark cut in half
---
Based on stuff decoded from the game files (including some audio files) and some speculation for good measure it would seem that is some form of Battle Royale thing.
---
It is a stretch [that they would go to such lengths for the sake of misdirection] but I hope the devs are pulling our collective legs on this one and is in fact nothing to do with a Battle Royale.
---

Sleeping in a bed actually gives you a longer AFK timer than anything else

Ill help whats your gametag
---
I’m on Xbox, I’ve tried 17 times today and I’ve lost so many stimpacks, this game doesn’t even function correctly 🤷‍♂️
---
I can’t recall the exact name but I know they are not called neon letters.
---
Worked fine for me. Fix your shitty attitude.
---
Charleston (the town), by the church there's a rope bridge above a small stream connecting buildings. Climb up there.
---
Take off all armor (PA and regular).
---
Make sure aqua boy is on or the rads in water will kill you.
---
Jump off.
---
Have a player waiting by the stream to revive.
---
I did it this way and have helped several people.
---
Oh look another educated self righteous prick. The only way you can get a word in edgeways are on these forums so you go ahead good sir, fill your boots.
---
Did you try ONLY in that stream?
---
More like half for me. Maybe I'm easily satisfied, or maybe it's because of all my bad luck in the past that a weapon with 1 decent effect is still the best I have for that specific weapon.
---
I'd love some curly / frizzy hair. Not "wasteland rat" but just, y'know, curly. So few games support that hairstyle because it's not as easy as slapping on a solid chunk of textured polygons (a hair helmet) but I'd pay atoms for it.
---
You can also get T-51b and T-60 plans from the Distant Thunder event I’m also pretty sure you can get T-45 but I haven’t personally got them from it yet.
---
&gt;WoRkEd FinE FoR mE
---
Therefore this game must not have this shitty bug, if you have to go to one certain place when you should be able to do it anywhere just shows how bad this game is
---
Looking for the plasma plan too, no luck so far.
---
Deathclaws don’t drop hides
---
They’re like those hide bundles you find in the world
---
Trash that has a random loot pool like Gulpers or Mega sloths would be a better chance, otherwise, just open every container you find
---
Would be cool if all respond in some kind of way. Like you waving Grahm he waves back or something
---
Oh, probably around 1000 guns in total
---
Or a chance to summon an amorous Skunksquatch.
---
I've spent 1500 scrip on a mix of 3* ranged and melee, and traded in every one but one of them. The only one I kept was an executioner's super sledge, with 40% faster swing and nocturnal as the third perk, I think. About the same damage as All Rise, but faster. A little heavier (since All Rise has that nice 90% weight reduction), but it's still only 8 lbs.
---
I've mostly gotten garbage.
---
The game would take up more resources generating the targets at range? No need to load the monsters if you can not see them.
---
But can the server handle it 🤔
---
I didn’t do it there, I did it in the Mire. Worked fine.
---
With luck across the river from the overseer camp behind the bridge or up the hill in opposite direction where the parcours is.
---
Pretty much just keeping an eye out and posting on Reddit. 
---
If you're on PC I'm part of a Brotherhood of Steel guild.

I tried in lake Eloise, spruce knob lake, dried lakebed, the Whitesprings pool, the Whitesprings stream, and a lake next to vault

I’ve heard the plasma grenade drops from Ash Heap events but I cannot confirm this as I haven’t received it yet. Your best bet would be to try doing Ash Heap events when you can.

This seems like a you problem it's worked fine for me and a few dozen people I have helped do the challenge

What is wrong with you? I don’t hate the game, just mentioned some bugs.
---
You reaction is a bit rude, but did you read it well? I mentioned clearly that I ❤️ FO76?!
---
And what about youtubers got to do with me? Like Juichehead, that’s an exploiter! 
---
I stated just some bugs/issues, some are laughable and some are just annoying.
---
So, don’t react violently next time, read the whole post and put it in a good context.
---
It's in your radial wheel most likely, with the trade emote
---
He’s unstoppably though

Would be great - like the settler bell from Fo4 or the triangle bell as Aaronholt!
---
do you need it too deadmemes?
---
Ok. Last question. Did you just die outright or revive but badge didn’t register?
---
Do it during the encyrptid event.  Theres a small pond in front of the shack and people are always dying during it.

I did consider that it might be possible that I fucked up and accidentally included a type of tree as a source of wood - which would explain that
---
Did end up getting it as we. Thanks for the help.
---
Aren't they the same there's 2 female mohawks
---
You spelled bitch boys wrong.
---
Well, it could be a red herring, but if that's the case, why make a crap ton of audio files around it and not just ~10?
---
Ahhh got it. Here I was all excited for possible subtle indicators of area-based DLC haha 
---
You did an amazing job though, seriously this is all so helpful! Thank you!
---
Um... it’s Skyrim
---
Oh damn that's pretty awkward to do.
---
I'm wondering why my big game data dump doesn't seem to include those things though. Would be a lot nicer if it did.
---
But good job anyway, will be great so see a map of all types
---
This is a great idea. Binding it to a specific bench is a good compromise.
---
Yes it fixed it! Thank you!
---
Also if you had any idea who I were referring to and why, your comment wouldn't of been made. Another goof jumping in head first with zero clue or understanding of what the post was about and why its funny to have done what I did.
---
You fucking nerd.
---
Is this Juicehead from YouTube? I read your replies and instantly envisioned him and I haven't seen his face, just heard his annoying voice. I imagine you sound just like him, a nerd with a year round cold.
---
I mean.. as long as it doesn't fuck with the main game that could be fun
---
Deathclaw nests (very low chance), Super Mutant Behemoths, Gulpers, metal boxes, footlockers and junk 'nodes'.
---
They are rare as rocking horse crap.
---
Said that as opposed to the fucking Unstoppables comics you can actually buy them from other players because the objective is fulfilled by scrapping them.
---
I revived my friend 17 times
---
thanks for the info about SB, just found out this morning (after 900+ hours of game time) the food processor ones would not work as a  ingredients for Brain Bombs and other fine food and drinks.
---
1st online game huh?
---
I was thinking as I read OP, that I’d be ok with a few perks *only working* one place. The camp would be that place. There’s over 20 points that would be good that way. 
---
Making it passive for a hub area besides the camp would be fine with me too. I wouldn’t mind fast traveling to outside vault 76, Whitesprings bunker, etc to overrepair without swapping cards.
---
Sunny Top ski resort
---
Right, The elder scrolls 5 - skyrim, not eso. Sry
---
Have 2 that live beside my camp
---
It is a bit awkward, but if it works, I'm happy to do it!

This one is good for treasure hunting! Map location come with screenshot!

 https://dan-parker.github.io/Fallout76-Map/
---
I, too, thought it was just me...
---
This has NEVER been an issue for me up until the last... hmm, 4 or 5 days maybe? 
---
Mine manifests as the "frozen game", not a legitimate crash with error, or the sudden quit to desktop.   
---
Which is further annoying since I don't know if it's a general "game frozen and will recover momentarily", which I was **plagued** with for months...
---
Oddly enough, they seem to have *fixed* the "random freeze, but will unfreeze" issue this patch, yet now this cropped up for me :( Yet, it's very similar still, because I **know** the game is still "functioning" in the background due to Voice Chat of people on my team. I also know it (likely) won't recover like the other freeze, as in those instances the background music would continue, and from experience anytime it did stop I knew I'd have to kill Fallout76.exe  
---
In this instance the background music ends rather soon after the freeze. 
---
Thankfully I know if it freezes in the Pip, I don't need to bother waiting. Unfortunately it's annoying as hell!
---
So yea, my theory is it somehow has something to do with, maybe, a plan we've learned? If this had immediately started after the patch, I'd chalk it up to *that* as the cause... but this started out of no-where for me... with perhaps the exception of the Purveyor's location being unlocked client-side?? However, that doesn't explain everyone else, which is why I'd think it would be somehow related to something we can obtain or acquire. With the introduction of player shops, I've been coming across the occasional plan I've yet to learn and so that's why I considered it a potential cause.
---
Why and how? Pfft, I dunno man... It's a bug... they don't always manifest in logical ways, otherwise they'd likely not make it to pushed out patches. Nay, they crop up when a whole bunch odd circumstances are met. heh
---
You can get extra badges much quicker through the Campfire Tales event, the challenges are best done passively
---
You're getting downvoted because ppl want to continue fleecing ammo from their sellers.
---
lmfaoooo at the negative karma i raked up in here in just what, three days? is this subreddit literally run by bethesda or are you all just seriously out of touch with reality? don‘t answer, i don‘t care anymore. i‘m out, there are better fallout 76 subs that don‘t take themselves so seriously. bye felicia
---
Dont u get them by doing the dailys?
---
My argument: at least they aren’t Hi-Rez who fix something every BIG patch, then break a lot of minor things that could probably be fixed easily but won’t for a month or two.
---
New Gad has a few, and the hills near Helvetica seemed to have a few during the Faschnat parades
---
If you do I haven't gotten any and I've done the dailys every day.
---
I would recommend finding a way to get a second point in agility for ammosmith...you'll need it. You can put in damage resistance at the cost of ap, or some other arbitrary agility perk when not crafting ammo.
---
You should start a petition...
---
Call it....
---
Im Shit, Remove Crit.
---
Or..
---
IDK about you...
---
Fortnite Forever...
---
Really? I've done the camp fire tales event several times.and haven't received any badges.
---
same.  on two chars.
---
i'm sad about it :(
---
Thanks very much! OP and i made it happen.
---
Pop Quiz.
---
1. If you find a bug in the game you should...
---
* A. Directly report it to Bethesda so they can put it on their to do list.
---
* B. Post it on Reddit with detailed instructions encouraging people to exploit it.
---
good hopefully you get to have your backpack soon ..if that's what it's for
---
i would like to see how different photomode poses look with power armor, the pictures in the shop only show how they look without power armor even when there are multiple images
---
Oh you can't get them all at once in a few hours.
---
Weord i see it all the time
---
I'm pretty sure it's a 1/4 chance to get a badge each time you finish the event
---
Thank you I have just about ever treasure made since beta still
---
I pretty much love this idea. Bethesda you have plenty of time to fix this up.
---
I've gotten the blunderbuss  3 *  three times I can't stand it anymore. I'm done with that legendary purveyor crap.
---
That’s true too. The poses/images they use aren’t always super flattering to the armor.
---
Homeskillet if you are worried about stims I play on Xbox and I've got the hookup, I have like 50 for sale and another 514 in my inventory
---
Did your test ran out of budget but everything was fine, had a friend try with his camp as well everything whent fine, lower your graphics setting sir..perhaps it's a resource extractor or water purifiers or enemy spawns or alot of passing players ?
---
Ugh please not battle royale. Not again.
---
The real question is which voice to give my Mrs. Nanny.  The French accent one, Hynden Walch/Recon scope one, or one like Rose.  I guess Midwestern Park ranger is an option now but... nah.
---
They are being thorough? :P
---
I sincerely hope is a windup and Nuclear Winter turns out to be an awesome coop PvE DLC.
---
I have 4x Possum badges from the scout master events (Think I got them from the bug one) but am still stuck as a tadpole as so many of the tests are bugged. 
---
Ps. I've not see mention before so thought I'd share here, you can check how many badges you have from the pipboy stat menu.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous as soon as you criticize anything in here you get downvoted to oblivion
---
You and me both.
---
Maybe you can buy the plan, and you can unlock cabinets when you find the game. For example, I currently have 4 of the games, so I could make those 4 cabinets. When I find another, that one will unlock.
---
Yea sure if I can revive you back.
---
Same thing happened to me today. Sat down to play today and wondered why I was taking unusual amounts of damage, checked my PA and my torso was gone.
---
I had literally made this torso last night as it was the first time I could make level 45 excavator.
---
that does make sense, but I still feel people who are going to take advantage of the spawning are already going to do it and them disabling them especially now with vending is doing more harm than it would good.
---
Pootis!
---
I have been trying the toxic goo vats at West Tec, but since the last update it doesn't seem to irradiate me anymore.
---
The nuclear waste ground just west of West Tec has plenty radiation and a decon arch.
---
?
---
that's the problem I don't think it can determine that until you load in a world , maybe eventually they will be able to have it check this beforehand if they can.
---
Deal. I have water at my camp. My GT Is D FIELDS
---
Aw man I just got a Bloodied Faster Fire Rate Ultricite Gatling Laser with 25% less VATS AP cost from the Purveyor and I was gonna start a new character for it.  Hope there isn't a gamebreaking bug for it that never get addressed...
---
I've got broadsider and assaultron head as my first to! But third was 10mm pistol :/
---
Thank you too
---
Are you sure you're looking at the right plasma ammo?  Cores, not Cartridges?
---
Joining now 👍
---
Every time I'm at a camp like that I'm expecting it to just happen to be at the time the person who made it is leaving the game.
---
Devs themselves have said the easiest way to reach them is via Reddit, rather than their own forums.
---
Often times the quickest way to get a bug fixed is to bring it to public attention.
---
I’ve only kept one thing so far and I’m not sure I’m going to use it. I keep trying for a rifle and get something else, so all the ranged weapons get sold back. And 90% of the armor I get is for the right arm, and I like the right arm armor I already have. It’s getting annoying.
---
You still giving out marine armor helmets?
---
My game name is the same as my Reddit name.
---
You’re right it doesn’t happen to everyone. My thought on that was install date. I have had the same 76 install since the game was released. I don’t know if that is what messes with everyone else freezing but that was my thought.
---
My game freezes exactly the same as yours.
---
Sure. Why not. Lol
---
I'm personally of the opinion that ammo should be crafted 10 or 50 at a time regardless of bullet type, but the amount of resources each caliber needs is different.  Further more, I believe that LMGs and miniguns should be legendary weapons in their own right.  A 50 cal sniper rifle and a 50 cal machine gun should *obliterate* all but the toughest of enemies.   And with that increased power should come difficulty.  You want to fully load up your .50 cal machine gun?  You'd better be willing to put in the work and even then only save it for special occasions.  But given the game's balance system, I know that's all just a pipe dream.
---
I’ll be on tomorrow from about 10am UK time, loom me up Looprevil64.
---
He probably didn't buy that much. When it says "X bought your 5.56 ammo (15,000)", the number in parentheses is how much they now have in their inventory. I bet if you check your stash you'll still have most of the bullets.
---
&gt;people said the .308 crafting count can't go up because of the hunting rifle
---
That is super duper bullshit, I don't doubt it though. 
---
It's like saying that the yield of 5mm rounds should be balanced around the gatling gun instead of the minigun, even though if it were it'd severely impact the viability of the mingun.
---
There's like a 75 percent tax on stacks of ammo it seems like.  You probably got some caps but not the 13.5k you were due.
---
Not sure for you but played about 3 hrs and probably had 12-15 between 2x @ Whitesprings and 1x time at West Tek. Only 1 3* Vampires Radium and the rest 1* stuff.
---
Nothing is locked. Come on in and make yourself at home. Just remember, I’ll check out your camp too. If you lock yours, don’t be a hypocrite and enter mine.
---
This!!!!..... definitely need more heavy weapon badies out there....aside from the occasional mini gunner
---
I haven't gotten anything worth keeping. Closest I came was a halfway decent war drum and a shovel I considered keeping for the novelty of having a 3* legendary shovel. Shredded them along with everything else though because I like being able to fast travel.
---
I checked, I don't. Maybe it has anything to do with their tax?
---
So they just nerfed the guns so that the devs don't have to fix / improve their game's system?
---
Jesus if that is true, then the devs are lazy or just don't give a crap..
---
As far as I'm aware, Gunsmith doesn't effect Lasers or Plasma weaps.
---
Or make the scrip limit 1000 but instead of daily reset make it a weekly reset. I'm convinced it's 150 scrip daily because of all the dupers.
---
It would be better with a black shirt.
---
[Clean Black Suit](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Clean_black_suit_(Fallout_76))
---
No i litterally got none. Ill just keep selling my ammo on the market I think.
---
Wish we could get the Lobster helmet again. I hear it was removed from the Atom store.
---
I guarantee "is someone in your spot" will never happen. If it did load times would be horrendous for those that it happens to. As your going to do the same thing just without a heads up that "we found a good server for you but we need to check again" notice. 
---
Dedicated servers would be amazing but right now its looking to put you in as close of ping with a set number of people already on it. Then expands its search and admittedly it does a good job at this. Not perfect but far from shit.
---
*takes the sign*
---
How many can I take at once it doesn’t say
---
Who said they fixed anything?
---
Grahm carries it, but he’s pretty hard to find.
---
Take the railroad track south of the Whitespring eventually you’ll get to a point where you can see ALOT it’s very beautiful
---
you also get badges from dailies, 25% chance
---
am about to get all backpack mods ..
---
Don't feel bad, between my two main characters I've run it maybe 10 to 15 times, and between that and the bug quest I think I've gotten MAYBE one extra badge.
---
It’s fun, but the reload is so long, and I have speed demon. It was a one shot weapon for me a WS golf club. I’m thinking to the right person, it may be worth 1-2k. I need to clear out some weight, so I’ll market mine soon.
---
/u/Lunaeria made a [spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i_made_an_interactive_checklist_for_all_pioneer/) checklist, as well, but more options are always good. Ever upwards!
---
Not too setting appropriate but devil in disguise and gi blues by elvis
---
No, don't have any plans nor the gun have weapon upgrades on the gun.
---
Not the ash heap then lol
---
I put my camp on the hill between Whitesprings and the lake/new gad and i think its pretty scenic. The forest and the lake itself and if the weather is fine you can see a glimps of the rockhound in ash heap too.
---
Ouch.  As a guy who makes a lot of 556 I know that's a rough loss. It seemed like I was only getting 25 percent of my ammo sale price so I pulled it out yesterday.
---
Camp Adams event can drop tokens, have about three from that
---
Apparently dailies do too, but I don’t really bother with those. Collect bug parts gives me nightmares
---
It's weird fore today. Did WS, train yard north of WS, Wes Tek, and steakhouse. Not a single legendary on there runs.
---
Depends. I’ve had runs at whitesprings with less than 5, and other with dozens. RNG...
---
I can guarantee you get them from it - I’ve gotten over 9 badges and I haven’t done a single possum challenge
---
Toon Town
---
But I've run it three times and not a single one which is quite odd
---
Yup all 100+ at something like 1.3lbs per with batteries included 2.
---
You can sell power armor parts loose. I sell Excavator legs with Calibrated Shocks. They're just really heavy.
---
Take off put back on
---
Name calling huh... how mature of you.
---
Theirs... is love to see it! I like creativity!
---
How do we change hair styles ?
---
Watonga good bet
---
The tp can block the sight of the turrets
---
Servers are virtualized.
---
I personally want to be able to wear armor over outfits like armorsmith in FO4 allowed
---
But if you sell the full power armor, it makes it lighter. I know it would be a good to sell it for parts only but I only have a limit amount of space in my stash box. 😔
---
I think there are a few Kingston Trio songs that'd fit
---
I took all my ammo off until they fix it. I’ve seen a lot of posts on here about this issue.
---
Yep pulled everything out aswel
---
If you can't view from a vending machine go to the stash box and view one of your weapons, then go back to the vending machine. You'll be able to view the weapons.
---
Saw same situation on another thread.   Definitely some bug, maybe with the tax.
---
It hopped a few times at Watoga with no luck, but that's where I've read (didn't specify train station or Phoenix so I checked both).
---
Eventually maxed out Gunsmith &amp; used the plan, then ranked it back to where I needed it. Was like 4 levels required just for me to finish Atomics.
---
&gt; sometimes
---
I think you mean 99.999999%o of the time as it will never follow me even half way there. Is there a specific path you take to do it?
---
It would be nice to be able to inspect your chassis and see whats on it, but as a quick fix you could always rename your chassis to represent what armor you have on it.
---
I got a lvl 50 3 star bloodied one off a mirlurk it's a keeper.
---
We're you close to max I had something similar I had about 20k and sold something for 6k from my vendor I figured id get the 5k and loose the 1k not that big a deal but nope I lost all 6k
---
Yeah, I noticed my 'aesthetic' and stuff tends to be right around Forest type stuff. BF likes the Mire for it's resources, but I can't ever see crap in there lol. And Toxic Valley is just.. brown. and dead.   I'll have to check out the spot you mentioned, it was only a little south of where I was scoping out when I made this post. :D
---
Someone missed the Patch 9 patch-notes...
---
I understand PC useri have some perk management mod available....
---
I don't lock anything. I considered using locked doors with a keypad so players could still get in but other things couldn't but I gave up on the idea before I found the plans.
---
Bethesda owes me 13.5k lol
---
You'll have to decide which prefix legendary set you want with explosive: instigating, anti-armor, two-shot, bloodied, berserker, etc
---
"Blood loss detected, morphine administered"  
---
"Vital Signs Critical, seek medical attention"  
---
"Emergency! User Death imminent"
---
It's there as I got it but don't use it as it will kill you it's crap so mod it then take it off.
---
I was around 9k
---
Nope - the vendor is what shows the camp.
---
I know, but we all have the same stash space. The reason we can't sell entire suits with details is the same reason that we cannot see the parts in our inventories: BGS needs to keep grinding on this work in progress. But until then, we all gotta make tough choices.  I only stock one of each leg at a time, for now. Gonna buy the X-01 Jetpack plans tomorrow and see if premade torsos sell.
---
If you dont look they are all over the map. I got the plan at r&amp;g station and the wendor in harpers ferry last night.. I might still have a plan in my vending mashine but wont be on in about 12 hours.
---
I've kept 2 out of the 11 legendaries I bought from her.
---
If have the torso plan , willing to trade.
---
That's what I do but it would do better when you sell the PA and others can see the info.
---
The Plan: High Capacity Backpack Mod is bugged. Just transferring it into your inventory causes you to learn it. All other Plans work normally.
---
I did find a friend with it that I learned it from, so I'm all set. I'm going to delete this post.
---
Are any helmets available?
---
Oh ok that's good to know, cheers!
---
Maybe this is what happened? However alot of ppl in this thread seem to have this ammo problem I for 1 haven't had any problems with it
---
Had a similar experience where the guy approached and gave me the drink and told me to drink it. Instead I waved and ran away on my quest. Later during a fight I drank it without actually reading what it was just assumed a regular cola. Well to my surprise as I’m hiding behind a car fighting mutants I disappear and wake up about a 3rd if the way across the map and couldn’t fast travel due to being forever overweight. I eventually died and lost all the goodies I was trying to save. FYI still low level and still haven’t even gotten close to returning to the spot I was transported. All I kept thinking while trying to get back was “ you, your good you” from analyze this
---
They need to add [this](https://youtu.be/A-W_QzbC8FM)  as the tool to throw the tp.
---
Good luck to you and thanks.
---
I personally don’t care about karma and such, but it’s funny to me that someone would downvote this post.
---
Give it another go - particularly after the last few patches, and separating the pvp/pve crowds, it's managed to find it's own identity.
---
Listen to this man...
---
As i said, in AGI tree keep Born Survivor (only lvl 1), and get irradiated until 20% HP. Yes, you will die sometimes (you will only loose junk, so dont be afraid), but not too many once you learn to play the build, and you will need to carry a lot of stimpacks and diluted radaways. Also, when farming SBQ it's horrible to equip protective suit and unequip all your Uny+Bolstering equipment ( I usually carry 3 Uny + 2 Bolstering pieces). Of course if you can get Uny/Sentinel or Bolstering/Sentinel pieces, those would be perfect (specially heavy combat pieces… those are god roll). Also, as you will have a lot of STR thanks to Uny armor, you can carry a bloodied light melee weapon to close combat or low lvl mobs and dont want to waste ammo (I use a Bloodied/Swing Speed/90% Weight Reduction machete... and without any melee perk I onehit lvl 62 ghouls when sneaking… 2 hits when not). It's very funny to play the build
---
This makes a lot of sense. I know for sure I’ve had trouble getting both of these to work in that 20-24 hr window. Thanks.
---
Whent to west tek today and not one legendary was there normally there is 2-3 .
---
I am RhymingFezzik and I will die for your swims. 😇
---
Think ill just stay away from the vending machine for now, maybe just sell plans and stuff.
---
Seems like campfire tales and the dailys have only given me possum badges. The only tadpole badges I’ve earned have been from the tedious challenges...I think.
---
Is there an answer to this question? What are you hopping looking for?
---
Pretty good, if you're a heavy guns build.
---
For a bloodied player it’s perfect
---
just venting my frustration at the camera, I would be fine if there wasn't a quest that required the camera to complete, anything a quest requires should have a guaranteed way of obtaining.
---
I’m assuming the ultracite Gatling laser uses regular fusion cores when saying yeah it’s a great weapon, it’s not really god roll but I believe it’s one of the best we can get considering explosive has been removed from energy. 
---
It would have been god tier with 25% FFR but it is in no way a bad gun at all especially since fusion cores can be buffed to 1000 uses with the power user perk and they cost around 50-100 to buy from players meaning your ammo consumption is a crazy 1cap per 20-10 bullets whereas most other guns it’s .5 - 1 cap per bullet.
---
I did notice on the servers that I did eventually find with them, none were at WS. I explored the other nuke areas, and that was neat to see, but didn't see any legendaries.
---
You’re hopping a known location. How do you know that guy/gal isn’t somewhere else on your server map? The alternative is you visit every possible location, personally I don’t like that option! Don’t sweat it, you’ll probably hit the encounter on your next jump :)
---
Also I wanted to mention my Xbox has completely shut off three times.
---
While there are a lot of cool peeps out there in the wasteland, we all run into these type of players mad at the world who get off on ruining others experiences with the game. 
---
Most likely the same in real life or worse a victim of bullying in their own life and now acting out to make them feel better or even in some way because they feel cheated... 
---
Positive note... the far greater majority of people are pretty cool...
---
Ideally the best situation is that all outfits become under armour, other than hazmats etc. That way you could wear anything you wanted and could have as much or as little armour showing to suit your style.
---
It uses regular Power cores. The damage with the standard receiver is the same as the normal Gatling laser with Primed Receiver. Crazy Damage
---
I hung signs saying I sell ammo in bulk, willing to sell much cheaper then 1 cap each.    Wish we could bulk ammo.
---
Thanks for the info I haven’t looked into ultracite weapons much. Definitely not a bad gun at all.
---
Yup! My legs on my wasteland desert camo paint always disappears which is expensive since it has a calibrated shock on it.
---
OMG that is exactly my first one (of ten). You lost but crossbows can be fun. They were a great way me to build up 5.56 and .45 ammo for a while.
---
Cameras can be found on more than just the tourist, sitting on 5 broken prosnaps right now, and a couple I repaired until I discovered they couldn't be traded or sold 😕
---
Afaik the tourist only gives the quest for the 105mm lens which really isn't worth it as you need to be just as close to stuff for it to register for challenges/quests
---
A group of griefers that got countered by patch 9
---
Thank you for the info too. Now i have to find someone able to mod it haha
---
that's literally besides the point, I have heard it may not spawn at all, at any of the locations, and what, you expect me to not only server hop but fast travel to a dozen locations for hours on end?  the point is *ANY ITEM A QUEST REQUIRES SHOULD HAVE A GUARANTEED WAY TO OBTAIN!!*  it's not that hard to understand...
---
Could be interesting. A BR game with durability and hunger? Sounds fun
---
I assumed the MIRV weighs 60lbs and when you remove the MIRV mod it becomes 2lbs because of the normal 20lbs, but now that I think of it I've never seen the normal MIRV weapons weigh 60lb before...
---
It’s called “Signs and Letters” I believe...
---
Definitely lost. This legendary vendor as it is is absolutely bogus. Me and my brother just used all the scrip for the day and got 3 bone clubs. Nobody wants this crap. They need to either take away the daily 150 scrip limit or buff the kinds of loot the vendor gives you.
---
Don't touch that with a fork
---
Did trading the wing work?
---
Yep, it is indeed. I just saw it on graham but had no idea how expensive it was.
---
I have got two ok 3* heavy weapons, not that i use them and two three star bolt guns.  One was explosive and vampiric whic i gave away and the rest are waiting to be chippered.  The armour has been rubbish.  Got wood?  I sure have now...
---
If you’re on xbox I’ll take them all. I always run out lol.
---
That’s what I’ve been telling people. When people want to find a wolf/fox I recommend the yellow container in the secret sheepsquach room as it has both corpses in it by default. It’s how I got them
---
&gt;Cameras can be found on more than just the tourist 
---
care to enlighten me?  cos otherwise what tf is the point of your post?
---
Are you being sarcastic? I can't tell because that would be horrible
---
I’ve picked up a few 3* scout armors and for example 1 has the ability to breath under water so technically you could now use another perk card in its place. 
---
I’m waiting to get a full set.
---
Np :)
---
Can I join too? I need to do it as well
---
It seems like they always mess up rank 2 versions of perks.
---
Assuming you're talking about the camera, have you visited all of the possible spawn sites before hopping?
---
I'm pretty sure it's guaranteed to spawn somewhere in the world, so it doesn't require server hopping, just takes more effort, but I could be wrong.
---
I do agree that "Here's a Quest, Good luck finding it in the first place," isn't the best idea, and honestly a "Check Tourist Site for Survivors" Misc quest would have been a better implementation.
---
GT SUN G0D RA
---
You need to complete the quest to find the broken spares.
---
Why is there a water drop with six stars around it in front of the name?
---
Like I can tell it's a PC mod, but why would that ever be a symbol to differentiate a weapon?
---
Most of it will be trash, so it will take a few days before you get something you want to keep (or exchange with another player for a weapon/piece of armor you really want, as it fits their build, but not yours). I'd stay away from 3 star weapons, as the first two legendary effects are usually the most important eg. anti-armor, explosive for ranged weapons and bloodied, swing speed for melee.
---
I've found really good results going exclusively for 2 star ranged weapons. You may get back less scrip when you scrap the stuff you don't want (or is no use to anyone else) but you do get *twice as many rolls* ie. the cost is 50 vs 100 scrip. This is important, as eventually, if you roll the dice enough times, you will get something pretty decent or even mindblowingly good. It's a shame it can take so long, as even with 3 rolls per day (50 scrip), but that's what we're given.
---
I have multiple characters so its quicker to get results. I saved up about 2500 scrip before the Purveyor arrived, but even with 1000 scrip that's still 20  rolls on 2 star weapons. On the 1st day, I had a furious +25% fire rate gatling gun, bloodied 50% crit laser rifle, anti-armor explosive black powder rifle plus other explosive pistols. I can usually find or buy enough cheap legendaries to buy 300-400 scrip per day (some players are still selling to robot vendors at train stations). Yesterday I couldn't believe it when I rolled for a quad-explosive handmade, bloodied +25% fire rate railway rifle and gatling laser too. I'm hoping to see some bloodied explosive weapons too, but I would never have got any of these just farming random legendaries at West Tek, Whitesprings etc.
---
Clearly
---
I heard it's a random encounter, not guaranteed to spawn at all
---
Either server hop the mothman statue or I find one off a goul at the whitespring golf course all the time. Good luck!
---
Yeah, fun isn't the right word. But in theory it could be an interesting take on the genre. Fallout, however, may not be the best game for it. Actually, I'm more interested in the idea of a Team Deathmatch mode in the game.
---
Some blue grass, I mean I like the Andrew sisters and Inkspots, but come on, it's WV.
---
Also dueling banjos
---
Yeah, your 5 handmade rifles use up 100 pounds of your carry weight and stash.
---
I found a broken deluxe camera in the cabin of the new pioneer daily. Didn't know they coukd spawn in the world.
---
I have a safe on my camp property, it’s locked daily but only respawns after 20 hours... nothing great in it other than meds and a random armor piece.
---
Atomic shop skin
---
Dumb.
---
No, you have to kill and loot the Mothman yourself. Sorry.
---
Halloween runs through your veins too eh?  Hopefully they'll see this and it'll form into an idea.  One can hope.
---
500 atoms in Atomic Shop
---
I find lots of them too and fixed one to put the night vision lens on, but I don't think it works without the quest, unfortunately.
---
I don't want to give put someone's GT when I dont even know them. I messaged them and asked if it was okay. Sorry mate, i dont wanna give out people's information without them knowing.
---
System?
---
I did at the back side of Grafton dam.  Near the pipes.  Ended up both having to be in the shallow water for it to work.  I am on Xbox, I could help later.
---
Why so hostile lol, I hope it'll take you at least 5 more hours of server hopping to find your camera.
---
I got it from the Mothman event up at the lighthouse were you have to get the fluid from fireflies...
---
The limit strikes me as purely arbitrary. It actually happers my limited play time. Too many legendary Items I want to scrap because they are crap nobody would buy and no room in stash from the items on my vending machines.  I live the over encumbered life now....
---
I don't think ammo stacks, same thing happened to me.
---
Yes, but keep the point requirement. We don’t want people with 2 Perception to have lvl 3 Lockpicking as passive.
---
I got a two shot exploding railway rifle yesterday, thing is sweet!
---
Yeah the building interface
---
Oh I play on pc
---
because you clearly have information that will help me but choose to withhold it, and the only reason for that would be if you were an asshole...
---
That seems to be getting worse, which sucks as i pretty much use one 85% of the time.
---
Fallout just sucks sometimes I guess, I have an instigating deathclaw gauntlet and it works fine 100% of the time.
---
My first experience was a dude in a fire hat at flatwoods. I was wandering around trying to decide if I was gonna keep going and this dude runs up going "wooooooo" not that loud, just sort of talking volume. Runs right up to me, hops twice, says "no mic? thats a shame woooooo" as he runs in the other direction. Then he helped me do the kill protectron quests. Was pretty neat and made me decide to keep going.
---
That's a little worrying...
---
I mean, normal random encounters, it's just a corpse or a vendor, but locking a quest behind that would be a really stupid idea.
---
And yet, it's almost believable that Beth would implement it like that, against all common sense.
---
I got jumped by two level 50 scorchbeast and a legendary sheepsquatch all at the same time after clearing the mole miners from the ash heap red rocket. Beat all three by hunkering  in the garage and using my two shot .50 cal out the door.  I’m level 180 so the scorthbeast weren’t too tough, but that sheepsquatch was a bullet sponge.  It took about 2 clips to kill . Once I killed it I jumped out from the building and fleeced its body and I’m glad I did, it disappeared about 30 seconds after I killed it.
---
FYI, in case you didn’t know, the fireproof perk help tremendously with the scorchbeast sonic attack. At level 3 it’s just an annoyance....
---
I use the up and down arrows
---
Blood drop\*... it means bloodied.
---
I have heard of it spawning randomly in the world, but still a ridiculous situation nonetheless...
---
Nice....  thanks buddy
---
I got it from one of the side quests from the bulletin board in van lowes taxidermy.
---
I got it completing the insect side quest for the pioneers.
---
What gets me is the release of the new boy scouts missions and one badge option endinf with a requirement to build and use an object thst does not exist in the game.  How the hell did that pass QA?
---
I'm on now will send you a request
---
I doea says in the challenge that i need to scrap it not aquire it
---
This. Your character is the priority, not your base. 
---
Once you've loaded in, it can check if your Camp can be placed.
---
Agreed. Save those points for bad ass skins
---
I got a bloodied LMG last night and it shreds, SB get melted super hard, a shame about the mag size and the ammo, could be a great SBQ killer (or maybe it's my build idk)
---
In the watch tower with the skeleton outfit you can find a poster with costume ideas
---
How many do you have, sir?
---
I'd like to see some more classic coal mining songs, to go along with the Ernie Ford numbers.  Maybe even venture into Woody Guthrie/Pete Seeger labor movement territory.
---
Option for grow pots, boxes and hydrophonics would be good.
---
Ugh. I been making a ton of 5.56, .308, &amp; 5 mm for a month to sell and now I'll have to wait for this bug to get fixed. Hopefully soon. Almost 100k of bullets are getting heavy!
---
I made a thread struggling. Started to give up but then decided to try the lighthouse a few times and it turned up. Seems like that's the one that spawns the most. For me it did anyway.
---
Wait, you're supposed to scrap the magazines? I bought 3 unstoppables comics and i didnt get the challenge
---
I just don't want the rumors to be true. perfect balance would be not playing it at all.
---
Check these places: 
---
1. Bolton Greens - Anne on fountain out front
---
2. Miners Statue
---
3. Tea Cup by power plant on picnic table
---
4. White Springs main entrance on hood of red car
---
5. Amusement Park first burnt out car in parking lot at main entrance
---
6. Civil war Cemetery
---
7. Nuka cola factory in waiting area inside plant
---
I found Anne at #1 above 3 times for friends.
---
Tfing point is there is an object called "broken prosnap camera" which is a world drop, though seems to be commonly found in red toolboxes and ghouls. You repair it at the tinkers workbench and you have a working camera.
---
The tourist is a guaranteed drop for the camera as well the bucket list note which starts a quest to get the 105mm lens
---
Yeah, I have an Instigating FatMan, though I only use it for goofing around, with the demolition perk it does over 2000 damage
---
Grahm does respond though...
---
"You no kill me, me no kill you!"
---
I have one of your on Xbox, I was holding onto it for rainy day cap fund...lol
---
thank you, I didn't know that and it would have been even more helpful in your initial comment
---
*Beep, beep beepbeep beeeeeeeeep*
---
Haha
---
Bummer. Nope, PS4
---
Added
---
I have mine near the cliffs at The Top Of The World. Gives a nice big few of treelines till the end of the map. There's a few super mutant type unmarked locations around there you can build on top of too if you want severed heads and limbs as ornaments.
---
Maybe cure cancer too, just sayin. I could easily get 3 3star legendary armor with the same type and different parts of the armor. This hide is a 0.00001% chance of getting it lmao
---
Totally agree! Appreciate you watching out for them as well. Nice to run across people that watch out for others. 
---
If they say it’s ok you can dm me and I’ll give you my gt. Thanks!
---
I do it for free, I might as well use that knowledge I gained after scrapping at least a thousand and I still have 1 more to go. If you’re trying to get all my advice is don’t get too frustrated, I’ve scrapped over 200 in one sitting and learned nothing, reliable stock is only 1 I have left. One day...
---
Marine combat armor isn’t that good though I heard/have seen for myself. In fallout 4 it’s the best though
---
The skins are not worth the 500 atoms. Wait for a sale.
---
In my latest camp build only a few things are locked up, my downstairs area is a free to roam workshop/shopping area with a front door and powered garage door for shoppers and crafting. 
---
But upstairs is my "Employee Only" personal housing space. I keep that area locked mainly because it's where I keep the switch which opens/closes the garage door below but it also powers up/down my vending machines. So if I wanna head out and explore I don't have to worry about potentially loosing customers because someone closed my store, literally.
---
Hahaha this was one of the best things I’ve read on here in awhile.
---
First time that happened to me i was only level 38 i had to run away and just abandon the workshop. though it was only 3 level 50 scorch beasts.
---
Wow. That is a cautionary tale. And good on you for doing it for free :)
---
Apparently if you set your focus on getting the hide, you wont find it. I tried for 5 days wandering from the northwest mansion to the prim fissure sites, still couldnt find it.
---
Is this a real thing... They can be dead?
---
Not in your stash, when you put them in vendor. I am down to 2 turrets for this reason, and no indoor decorations at all. I keep 0 stored items and don't really move often.
---
Server hop at Giant Tea Cup. Spawn is super close to the fast travel point
---
So that's why there's all the Civil War gear?
---
Not American, so TIL.
---
Will return the favor
---
Yeah I got mine the same way
---

Laser weapons are one of my faves, but they were really gimped since FO4 and never really recovered. The last buffin FO76 made them a mediocre weapon... not bad, but not good either. Buff lasers another 20 - 30 percent and that would make them viable again. I'm keeping my *** laser pistols just in case BSG does an MG42 on laser weapons.
---
Colonal's monument FTW
---
I thought maybe I could put a bar stool in front of it to kind of make it look like a high up desk of some sort, BAAAAAAAAAD IDEA, DO NOT DO THIS
---
When I sat down and tried using the computer, it hurled me under the world and I couldn't do anything, I couldn't fast travel or open my pip-boy or do anything, I eventually had to alt-F4 out of the game and when I came back in I was STILL UNDER THE WORLD FALLING, I kept having to retry until it eventually ported me back somewhere.
---
You need to be able to load into worlds where your camp location is  taken just in case that world is where your friend is, or the trading player from reddit is, or several other reasons.
---
Any chance I can get one aswell?
---
The quad has to be in CRE the an auto receiver.
---
Thanks a lot, I really appreciate that!
---
Previously yes, but with the advent of player vending and the fact that mobs won’t spawn at the top of Seneca Rock, I generally don’t anymore.
---
Yeah. I could use this help as well...
---
That's really helpful. Wasn't aware. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Good look, I appreciate the help man.
---
The classic "Trust people to be responsible with something or not let them have it in the first place" dillema.
---
Not everyone can be mature, and not everyone means to be offensive, but sadly there's no way of knowing who's who until it's too late.
---
You can change the travel in point by physically picking the camp machine up and moving it to a different spot in your camp.
---
The event that noone does and has to be triggered by going there.
---
I seen the plan at the vendors. I think it was grafton train station.
---
Pretty sure the taxidermy quests drop random plans. Like others have said the repeatable scout quest, "Strings and Things" is the best source to find all the mounted animals
---
All fair points. I understand now and retract my rant without deleting for others to also gain from. amen.
---
I wish poses could be used as an emote. Seems lazy they can't be.
---
thats a dud bud. if it was a win it would have all Vats related prefixes. like crit fills faster, or reduced vats AP cost
---
Ive only tried 3 times for 3 star melees.
---
3rd time i got a grognaks axe with
---
 50% damage reflected while blocking
---
+1 endurance
---
Cant remember the 3rd one right now
---
Its 10 dmage less than my modded super sledge but im keeping it. The other 2 were awful 1 handed weapons. 
---
Kinda wish there was a way to roll for specific weapon types.
---
dOeS aNyOnE kNoW?
---
\*complains about bethesda not doing things properly - post is full of typos.\*
---
Depends on what you have and are willing to sell for
---
I'm guessing its perforating magazine, i thought it was the reciever, but i have it hardened, its still doin git
---
Yonder good bet
---
Praise Atom.
---
I would be surprised if they *don't* continue the drip feed of new content. They want to keep people coming back day after day and that's the most effective way to do it. Might not be the same weekly/biweekly frequency like Wild Appalachia but probably pretty close.
---
Yup, i really like that post. I usually give it to anyone posting for info on fo76... 
---
Most of the time you'll either get downvoted for asking same questions everyone else asks (everyones tired of it). 
---
Or get tons of opinions that don't really help. 
---
This post is great because it's unbiased and gives pure facts, so that you can formulate your own opinion and make a decision.
---
You replied to the wrong guy, the other one was the one claiming that his performance was crap.
---
Anything other than berserkers I think
---
Cool thanks, we’re only level 50 so it took a bit longer!
---
I put piercing in it
---
Just east of R&amp;G station there's a random critter spawn. Just hop until you get rabbits.
---
Can confirm, comrad
---
My defend thunder mountain had three SB spawn
---
Hell my photo album is full of pictures of dead animals.  It's really macabre.
---
That actually sounds really fun
---
Lmao you sound like a chump
---
r/theydidthemonstermath
---
Looks like one of those Halloween costumes you buy online. Picture looks great, then you get it, and it's essentially a trash bag
---
And plus it's not like this is some game-breaking glitch that makes people become OPAF and ruin the game completely until it eventually gets fixed
---
lol nope wasnt the magazine, yeah idk what is wrong with it
---
Haha Haha so true. It's a  inflatable power armor 😂😂
---
I honestly have no clue, I'm guessing it's just a glitch with the gun
---
That's the great thing, you can pick whichever you like!.. for 100 ATOMs per voice.
---
My .50 does more than hardened .308. Doing 168
---
I have heard that many times but it doesn’t work consistently. They will spawn in where you originally put your camp machine down 99% of the time.
---
Your mom bastard
---
You’re * you chump
---
Agreed. You should definitely go find a better game to play. 
---
I have an Instigating Handmade and an IE Lever.. They always seem seem to work with sneak but I can can say the handmade isn’t that believable at times
---
Berkeley is cursed man. First ever workshop I took with a buddy that we actually built out. We were in our twenties. First defense was a Scorchbeast. Avoided it for a long time and the same thing happened the 2nd and 3rd time.
---
Lol fallout new Vegas it is 😂🤷‍♂️
---
I'd buy that for a dollar.
---
Why would we have to wait for Halloween? The Fallout world is in a perpetual state of Halloween decorations so let's do it now!
---
Thank you for the explanation. I don't remember really getting hit in the blast zone but maybe it happened earlier that night because someone brought me to an area I shouldn't have been yet and I got attacked by some high-level stuff.  I guess diseases don't affect character models.
---
They did something similar with FO4, I’m hoping this is in the cards soon.
---
no legendary prefixes. 
---
power armor is around the map but only has 1 core. when depleted power armor ejects user and self destructs. 
---
no vats, all players would be level 50, everyone would have the same special stats and perks. 
---
weapons would have to be instantly assigned to your select wheel. 
---
limit to 1 stimpak and 1 rad away active at a time. fix all hit-reg. 
---
found armor would have to be instantly equip itself if it is better then your old armor, on death you drop everything. 
---
no connection to any other mode. so you cannot take items from this mode to the base game, and the other way around. you would not lose anything if you decided to try out the new mode. 
---
cap rewards that would be added to your survival/adventure mode totals/ exclusive camp items and weapon skins depending on performance. 
---
even after all of these.. it would still be a bit of a joke game mode
---
Or at least a small terminal you can fit on a desk or table?
---
At least my mom raised me instead of being a prostitute 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Right. However,  your vending machines can still be accessed by other players when they are powered down.
---
No the spawn point is the first place the CAMP was placed and it does not update if you move it. Just don't build anywhere near it and your visitors will (mostly) be fine. Of course we shouldn't have to work this out and jump through hoops but hey, Bethesda and all.
---
Just decorate your own, I slap all kinds of trash on them and also include a radio
---
This is what I always do, except the other day, after doing this, I ended up trapped in their little shed they had put out of the way, holding only their fusion generator, with no doors or windows. Couldn't help but laugh
---
I jumped off the Charleston dam into shallow water when I did it with a friend
---
Yea the RNG put off that thing is rediculous. Yesterday I got a laser pistol that has quadruple ammo, +50% bash damage and reduced weight. The stupid thing has a 120 round magazine. I'm still holding on to it just because it weighs less than a pound. Lol
---
*it was a graveyard smash*
---
And, you can leave a baggie of fertilizer on their bed. 😉
---
i Know.  i feel ya.  i thought it would be great to add decimals to caps (so ammo could be sold at 2/1 cap for example) but then it would add the issue of people buying odd numbered purchases.  but yes, bulk makes a lot more sense.
---
Now how do you get out without using the door?
---
Your mother isn’t a prostitute, she does it for free 😂
---
Sadly, this seems not to be the case.
---
Yup, some players make a game out of it. Trying to find the most heavily fortified camps and pulling a Houdini inside. Lol
---
Fast travel, probably
---
I got one out of a suitcase randomly after I spent a half an hour server hopping at the water park for one. Had no idea they could be in containers
---
I was lucky enough just now to meet some new friends, and one offered to let me raise him in water. Unfortunately that was easier said than done... He kept spontaneously dying for some reason, even when I wasn't hitting him. He was a good sport however so after 2 doesn't rise we finally got it
---
Any time I get "good" legendary weapon rolls from her shop, they're on pipe weapons. It's fairly disappointing.
---
The legendary effect (auto-stim) has the chance to revive you once you're downed, where as the perk has the chance to use a stimpack when you're low on health (under 20% hp iirc)
---
Even better, atm I have post it notes on the go lol
---
Did 3 SB queen runs yesterday... Tagged her with a spare rifle I picked up and melee her to death, whilst everyone else was shooting.
---
Either the guns need a buff or melee needs to be nerfed hmmm...
---
Yeah it's 35 rad resist on marine chest. Not too shabby!
---
.50 does more damage with hunting rifles since the .50 was useless but now you have a reason to get the mod. They buffed it last patch only works on hunting rifles
---
I'd gladly play with lasers if they buffed it.
---
I got you
---
All the body's I've found out in the wasteland their backs are against the wall so cant see the num... there if one upstairs in grafton and I've seen another one somewhere cant recall though
---
So o found one and I'm at the tinker's bench but I don't see an option to craft or repair it? Definitely haven't scrapped it, do I still need a tourist for the quest?
---
the purveyor is good for the people that don't grind and get some interesting weapons
---
to the people that only does event 100 times per day and the scorched queen you will get better shit doing that
---
One of the taxidermy sidequests sends you to a sunken church.  The wendigo that spawned there was scorched for me.  I know that's very circumstantial though.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna check with sneak
---
Only decent one was a bloodied crit dmg perception plasma pistol, which I will make a rifle later. It's not that big of an upgrade to my 1 starred bloodied plasma rifle, but I'll take it.
---
They never really get into WW2 in fallout... hmm
---
Oh, that makes more sense. Really odd for them to use that though...but I guess there aren't that many options within the game
---
People downvote any bug being brought up.
---
The youtuberz hate squad!!!
---
Don’t have anything useful to say? Piss off
---
Working towards one myself, the plans exist and have heard it is equal effect with the good with salt peel but doesn't stack with it.  I don't think they have the same bug as high capacity plans, though could be wrong.
---
Vault 87 is literally on the other side of the eastern mountains.
---
It could be just a glitch, trying putting it away in storage then take it back out, or try vats and see take multiple test and see which works and doesn’t work
---
B. because it's a harmless bug and we're not getting fucking paid to QA their game.
---
Looks like the GPU took a nuke to the face, too.
---
How do you feel about the grind? I think that's what it comes down to. I know some folk with multiple characters over level 100, each build is dependent on what the plan is for that particular game session. Sniper, tank, stealth builds. They enjoy having sets ready to go. Me, I'm happy with my single character at level 200, and I still like to grind away. I just swap in and out the perks I need while my friend swaps characters. Psst Bethesda, perk presents. (Hint,hint)
---
Highest level I've seen on xbox was some punter on about level 340.
---
You can also place your power armor inside the house and enter it
---
Now I’m hungry
---
I feel like your on to something or at least the latest patch has been producing more legendary at times. 
---
Today for example I was on hot / legendary server.  
---
I started the day at WestTek and had a total of 6 maybe 7.  There where 3 on the outside (one of the mutant hounds was legendary) and I can't remember if there was 3 or 4 inside.  I usually only see 0 - 3 there these days.
---
From there, I went to White Springs train station to turn in the items for script and that is when things really headed up.  White Springs was in Nuke Zone mode but a nuke hand't been launched since I logged on to the server.  I was able to collect enough cobalt for 3 stable flux and started the loop around.  The glowing ones were out in force and I was the only one going through the loop.  Each group of glowing ones and 1 - 3 legendary in them.  When I arrived at the club house it was full of robots.  (not the first time I have seen this)  They were low level with the highest being 25 or so but there were at least 5 up stairs and another 3 down stairs.  I finished the right side couple few houses leaving the club house.  I decided to go over by the laundry and the parking lot and picked up 4 more.   I'm not sure the total count but it was enough to collect all my script today with mostly 1\* items.  
---
I admit that this could be a bug that WS thought it was a nuke zone but it was really done a long time ago.  
---
I ended up making 2 more trips around White Springs today and similar results.  I came back once to buy Speed Demon recipe and decided to take a loop and the same thing with the glowing ones and still had radiation flora around.  Someone had gone through the club house before me (all piles or robot parts).  
---
I have one other server that I thought was extra legendary as well.   I think it was about a week or so ago.  Not at good as today but still way above average in the number of legendary encounters.
---
You can take two more perk points to get a rank two one
---
Or you can just find them in perk packs. You will continue finding spares until you have one of each rank of a perk
---
No the plan can not be rented. The only one that can is the high capacity.
---
As do I..
---
Explosive weapons are in a pretty bad place, very low damage compared to their ammo weight. A 2 pound missile doing \~250 damage just isn't worth it to me.
---
I have gotten 10 3* ranged and 3x 3* armors.  Mostly crap and I'm slowly trying to return for script but I don't have much time to play so it's taking a while.
---
well if I see any fork wielding scorch I'll test that out
---
It seems like a really good game once you get the hang of it.  Seems like a steep learning curve.  Are there any like it on Playstation?
---
There’s this devil came down from somewhere song and was playing like a fiddle, that song it’s cool as hell
---
Oh, I think that was me! Lol!

With that super dark nights mod, cateye increased your nighttime visibility from 8 feet in front of you to 15 feet in front of you. It really was a lifesaver
