You mean fireproof in endurance?
---
---
---
It's a grind because there isn't much to do in the game. There are so few events that you've done them all before. Now the game is asking you to do all of it again. Again. And yet again.
---

---
All Seasons does is add a slight incentive. A very slight incentive.

---
100 score is given for the exp repeatable, you probably broke the 10k mark when the event completed
---
It’s called having a life to live and not being able to play this game like a job, but I’m sure a life is something that you lack if your too incompetent to understand why people want the grind to not be as frustrating
---
You sure that wasn’t your xp rolling over 10K?
---
Repeatable in weekly for 100 score for every 10,000 xp
---
People like that should just take their anti-social asses and go back to Fallout 4. Its like going to a concert and complaining that the music is too loud and there are too many people around.
---
Positive, i had just completed the xp repeatable during the first event I had done
---
My apologies. 
---
There's just almost always a negative intent when someone says it's them trying to get you to buy atoms. 
---
This sub has a tendency to see any effort to make money as a under handed, illegal, sleezy, immoral action by BGS.

I like to imagine it’s just one guy in charge of all the account banning

Scrap meat hooks and you'll learn it.

&gt; I have a not particularly optimized **stealth sniper** build
---
There's your reason why. When I'm sneaking through a silo with my napalmer Gutsies are fine, they go down easy. But out in the open where I'm not sneaking around? Yeah stumble onto two and I can get shot to death.
---
I need that and the beanie. Don’t think I’ll be grinding them. Too much work
---
I really hope that doesn’t happen. They owe me a hunters long coat.
---
can some one explain what the issue is so I can understand how to avoid it.
---
I only play nw when there is special items to be gained. So during holiday events when they have skins and camp items and now also to gain score for the board game. But for the score I don't do ones that may not be possible like revive players cause if I die first or if the team is all spread out well then I just wasted time.
---
Pc, ign derek1603.
---
Never had a time out and I hide-solo always-
---
Some is salty and downvoting all negative comments about their glorious crossbow. 
---
As others said. It's fun and usable. But just barely and still pretty trash. I have more luck with the single action and thats saying something.
---
I see why people prefer secret service lol thanks for the help!
---
Ah yes you made a much better decision than me who decided to solo that twice failed both times and gave up until a week ago
---
Veribots are kinda random all over the map.
---
For example, I’ve shot them down over morgantown train station.
---
IIRC, the farthest west I’ve taken down a vertibot was Beckley.
---
Theres an event in the ash heap specifically to shoot down a (survey, I think) vertibot.   Last time I did it, it was just west of ... Welch train station.  Edit” another posted named it - Flyswatter
---
There is another event at...Mt Blair Train yard, I think...cant recall the name of the event...where you have to take out a sentrybot.
---
IIRC, it is a L30.
---
I have noticed if at all possible going through a loading screen will make the body appear where it was killed (as apposed to where it landed). I constantly lose my kills at WS but I enter then exit and the body is there.
---
My favorite of the new NPC's. I want Gail to live at my camp.
---
Nope. As long as you place from stored tab it keeps everything.
---
imagine being bludgeoned to death with this
---
You can take the blackberry out of the wild, but you can’t take the wild out of the blackberry.
---
Correct. It blueprints automatically under your stored tab
---
Oh no... free stuff everyone can get. It would be bad if at the last levels they gave game braking utility/weapons. But no. They just give currency you can get some other way and garbage utility. The only useful thing is the lunchbox and it only gives extra xp.

Click a button, away you go.
---
Power armor or troubleshooters armor. Sneak around. Use hacker to turn off turrets at terminals.
---
I’d just like to be able to finish since I do all the dailies and weeklies. I have to go well beyond that to get to 100 in 10 weeks.
---
Just seems like a tiny Tina ripoff to me, and not a very well done one at that.
---
Yup. Big battles become almost unplayable with mine.  SBQ is Damn near impossible to shoot at since its stuttering so hard.
---
awesome! thanks for sharing your knowledge
---
I’ve got so many from Battle Bot. WTF they don’t stack.
---
Your examples are literally all examples about what the dev teams do. Don't try to weasel out of that. Unlike you I've paid attention to and tried to counter  each point you made that I disagreed with, and brought up my own evidence. You on the other hand haven't been able to refute a single counter point I've made where I presented clear evidence that the 76 dev team at least attempts to do the very same things you praise the MH:W team for and say they should learn from. The most you've been able to say is that I've repeated myself.
---
How about you go back and re-read what you wrote. I don't think you even understand what you're actually arguing at this point. Seriously what a joke. Your original post is nothing but talking about the dev teams and you want to say you never mentioned them. Also, on a slightly less related note you're also flat out wrong when you say MH:W only has cosmetic dlc. Last time I checked there was a $40 expansion that unlocked a whole lot more than just cosmetics.get your facts straight before trying to have a debate.
---
Edit: good job deleting your post. Maybe you actually realized how stupid you sound when you contradict your main post. See ya around. Don't let the puki puki nip you in the ass on your way out.
---
go to whitesprings and the black powder store vendors will sometimes have tons of meathooks for sale like 60 bucks each. buy them all and scrap them, you'll learn the mod. if the vendors dont have any, server hop until you find a version that does. they can have several different cheap weapons for sale that rotate, server hop a few times and you'll find meat hooks.
---
my favorite is shooting a fat man with 95% chance and the mini nuke not going off
---
I figured they were bugged so that’s why I never opened mine
---
I think there’s actually a pretty good deal of people of color, not a lot of Asians though (at least not that are alive)
---
My guy... I missed a whole clip with 95% chance. I feel your pain.
---
Thank you!
---
Probably just placed a camp item on a couch.
---
I usually forget to go solo, so when I get on a team, I unmute my mic just long enough to let them know that I'm either bush wookie or little mermaid and not to count on me for much of anything. Only once has someone objected, so I tried to pvp/fight. I died.
---
I sure hope so! Thank you!
---
It's problem #27654. I've seen this mentioned more times than I can count. But Bethesda only cares about money. They don't care about customers. They are a greedy company with zero pride and even less competence. I don't ever expect them to fix this. If they do it'll be so sloppy it will create 5 other problems they will ignore because hey. Their only priority is adding things that will squeeze every cent they can out of people.
---
I thought long and hard about how to explain my thoughts in this area - I'd rather keep my peas out of the potatoes and keep FO76 neatly compartmentalized, no need to endlessly circle, now is not the time for deep discussion. 
---
Let's just end it here, I get where you are coming from but I'm not sure if you get where I'm coming from with it and I don't think it matters if you do or do not.
---
Oh cool! I used seedy shed to make a one stop drop but it was a template. So I guess leave the vendor off the plan and its all good. Thanks for clarifying!
---
[removed]
---
Thats a great idea.  I don't think they have any interest in making the personal terminal useful though.  It could be used for so much more than it is.  In addition to your idea, it could be used to keep track of bullion, scrip and cap reset timers.
---
Yes its grindy but the challenges are easy and for the weekly i just do one a day till done so it doesnt feel so grindy
---
I'm on just for the score and to get the glitched Halloween and xmas unlocks
---
I’m very happy to hear that. Keep your head up my friend!
---
Some enemies are deceptively tough, especially if they run around and are hard to aim at.
---
With your 50 cal, you should only need 1 or 2 hits to hit them, however. Have you made sure that you've maxed ALL of the following perks?
---
- Heavy Gunner
---
- Expert Heavy Gunner
---
- Master Heavy Gunner
---
- Bloody Mess
---
- Stabilized
---
This while in Power Armor will ensure 1-2 hits to the body or face will kill any of these enemies with your 50 cal. If you are still having trouble, try to get an explosive 50 cal instead: the Two Shot affix isn't very strong anymore and is just making you less accurate for less damage / shot.
---
But are you a mad scientist hellbent on a mission?
---
Edit; honestly though it would be a sick costume to have, because we have the captain cosmos outfit already
---
How many other people do you thing are waiting for other people to join before joining it.  
---
It's free to travel to.
---
I think a lot of people are also playing now because of the Halloween/Christmas item unlock bug.
---
Not that I have found. Hell usually report to me whenever he hears someone swearing tho lol
---
I’m not sure many people who play fo76 play many other multiplayer games so they aren’t used to many concepts.
---
It happens if you are hit by an enemy or player right as the animation is starting. Usually it would cancel it out, but you get stuck in a loop. You can't move or use another emote. Equipping a weapon from your Pip-Boy will stop it. 
---
I've purposefully done it before when salty people try and stop my Mothman dance for whatever reason. They will smack you to stop the emote as soon as you do it. If you time it just right, they can't stop it and just frantically hit/shoot you to no avail. Then I go to Pip-Boy, equip a different weapon and go about my business.
---
Well u have to play at least 34 hrs a day to actually finish it, also if u miss a day ur screwed
---
thanks guys i did the challenge now but didn't get any score for some reason...oh well it's bethesda after all
---
I’m a fender guy through an through. Jaguar is my main. They cater more to us lefties. But I needed a gibby for that sound! Thanks!
---
If you move everything will be stored in a blueprint and you’ll be able to place the shed with everything inside. Just go to your stored tab.
---
I’m commando and it takes me forever to kill ants and crickets. I do love my crickets though.
---
Nah, I'll just roll with mods.  Back when the SBQ could be crippled it was a good source of steel using meat piles as ballons.
---
But that's literally what it means...
---
This business model is often used by free to play games. This is a 60 dollar game.
---
Sold mine for 10k last week
---
Because it's the only end game content the game has (and it's awful).
---
I got a Schecter C1+ about 16 years ago and I'm a big fan of them now.. but i also love ibanez. I have an SLS Series from Ibanez and theyre so thin and light its crazy.
---
Yeah VATS has been broken for a while. I miss so many crits too that it's ridiculous.
---
Yep, inventory levels are part of it, but it revolves mostly around the ridiculous amount of loose items in the game world. The servers have a hard time keeping up. I doubt it's about timers much at all, as far as the game's stability is concerned.
---
I have mixed feelings here.. On one hand I hate the grind but on the other hand I feel like Ive been more obligiated to explore spots I havent been to for certain challenges.. I feel like if the reward structure was better they couldve have had something really cool.
---
Gatamine
---
I’m melee as well.  
---
In the silos, it helps a lot to have a troubleshooters or AntiArmor weapon.
---
Might also want to consider forgoing your melee weapon and use a semi auto or full auto.
---
Do you have the healing factor mutation?  It can help reduce the number of stimpacks you need to carry.
---
First one I did - power armor (I did it in excavator - targeting hud will hilight the turrets), a troublshooters (gatling, I think).  Move slow, stay crouched.  When the turrets spot you, back up.  Snipe them with AA or Troubleshooter weapon.
---
BTW, it is easier solo than with a group - a whole lot less turrets and a whole lot less bot enemies.
---
Yeah, I am not sure Bethesda knows the difference between patch notes and a wish list. Their patch notes appear to be wish lists. How a professional development shop consistently delivers broken patch notes is beyond me. They could just leave them out if they are not fix yet.... they know this right? 
---
I am pretty sure the QA department consists of a chicken walking on a printout of "fixes." The human portion of QA department is really busy coming up with new skin ideas for high use items lead pipes and Alien blaster. So to save on time, the first 5 things the chicken shits on are the only items that get tested before release.
---
yes. do like this idea
---
And yet here you are insulting others on reddit. Lol. Thanks, i needed a good laugh today.
---
Exactly what I was thinking running after her in the factory. She even has the bunny toy.
---
It hasn’t been yet. I unlocked a few things today getting the 30 minute challenge
---
Never had a chance to try one! I very rarely see lefties in person anyway hahha. I’ll give them a shout
---
I believe the queen is classified as a beast while her adds are scorched
---
And here in lies the problem of the event lol
---
I wish i could queue for it by clicking on it on the map, its a unique event.
---
But id rather do literally anything else than fight that fucking robot Dx
---
Do you inly get score from the daily
---
Try using PA if it goes with your build. You can spam stims a lot faster than you can without it on.
---
I'm waiting until double xp to bush wookie my way to usable perk cards. Damage perks were such a bad idea to add to a randomized pvp death match, hopefully once I have them I can enjoy it.
---
This challenge is a waste of time.  In the time it takes to complete I would have already gained several times more SCORE points grinding.
---
Nice SG :)
---
I hated them until I sided with the raiders for the vault run. Solid entertainment, those two.
---
exactly
---
Good point, I couldn't even imagine trying to look for left guitars.. finding the perfect "normal" one is hard enough.. but yeah, you hardly ever see lefties.
---
also sucks when all 3 of your teammates are bots
---
Thanks man :))
---
Bows aren't great, really only sneak viable and mixing perception &amp; strength weapons isn't a wise choice of stat allocation.
---
Or...what if you could use 2 dirty water and a wood in a recipe that called for boiled water. 
---
Could work with anything. Have some cranberries, gourds, and snap tails —&gt; relish
---
+1
---
Inventory management lately has been climbing the complaint list for me. (Not weight management, but actual interface interaction and general lag).   
---
Just navigating through my inventory, pressing 'x' repeatedly on my item just for it not to do anything is really annoying. If I switch items/press up or down, it reacts to my command. But try to select/transfer/ press 'x' nothing happens. I can almost tell when it happens too; sometimes the spinning graphic animation appears choppy.
---
I read a comment the other day that  recommended clearing out all my notes and holotapes, which I did to no improvement. (goodbye lore!)
---
Something like inventory management should not be testing my patience this much. I feel like I'm in a vault experiment.
---
Could well be the weekly challenges bug where SCORE gets awarded at 3/5 completion. Basically it awards the SCORE before you complete the challenge, and parallelly doesn't award the SCORE once the challenge is actually completed (since SCORE has already been awarded at 3/5) which can lead to some confusion. Edit: actually just saw you said 100 score, could be the repeatable XP then...
---
A lot of the newer players don't know any better. I did my first couple Encryptids during Fasnacht. The first time, no one showed up. The second time, only a lvl 40 showed up. 
---
I waited a couple weeks and retried. That time, I had about a dozen people there to take down the Imposter.
---
Level 55 is where your build should be relatively fleshed out. If you were to build an archer/melee build this would be a good setup, but is only a basis for an effective build
---

---
Arrows are heavy
---
Iirc damage has to actually occur for tagging to be counted.
---
I would love it if it would actually refresh my dailies.Already ranks behind my friend because it's only giving 2 out of 7 dailies
---
While Bloodied _is_ a great way to max out your DPS, Angry Turtle has proven that the gap between Bloodied and Full Health using Junkies to up the damage is more or less a question of ammo efficiency and not so much a drastic shift in DPS. This is specific to heavy gunners. A bloodied melee is of course going to max out damage with bloodied weapon + radicool + adrenal + unyielding + STR-boosting food + melee damage-boosting food, but you don't get that with heavies. At best, you get adrenal + bloodied working in tandem to boost damage, so the rest will have to come from the weapon damage perks (heavy gunner in this case), bloody mess, Adrenaline (currently not working) and the armor-reduction perks (stabilized, tenderizer).
---
Go watch the video; it's very educational. He even does it with crafted weapons to show that it's not the legendary effects, but the perks, mutations, and weapon mods that are affecting damage the most.
---
The more different stuff you have on you or your stash the slower the game, and at some degree the server you are on, will run. If you try to cook a lot while having every copy of every magazine, bobbleheads, treasure maps and a shitton of plans, you will experience major delays.
---
Against tanky enemies, vats crit damage is the way to go since concentrated fire will raise your your accuracy to 95 anyways. Against general mobs, vats hit is better since you will miss less headshots and thus save ammo, the extra damage probobly make you save any bullets since it likely wont turn 2 shot kills into 1 shot kills or 3 shot kills into 2 shot kills
---
No point in arguing with the mentally ill.
---
Well this was a fun story...
---
Close to white springs I'm on the golf course directly next to the skeleton with the tractor I'm close enough to run over and far enough so I don't get nuked when people do runs there.
---
Also just because I don't get to talk about guitars with anyone, lol... here's my Schecter C1+, then SLS 540, then Schecter Blackjack ATX on my rack.
---
The SLS is sooo tiny comparably, lol. Also don't mind how my dogs hairs find themselves on every god damn thing I own.  
---

---
I’ve learned since coming back after Wastelanders that the majority of people are just blindly playing the game and killing shit. 
---
At this point, the only people I have any faith in are Bloodied builds, since you have to actually put effort into your build, and the low health makes them easy to spot. 
---
The amount of times someone joins Encrytpid or RR and immediately starts it is annoying af.
---
when a gutsy starts firing lasers at me I breathe a sigh of relief.
---
Cool I will give it a shot, thanks
---
And you’ve turned any active ones in?  Have you tried gaining raider reputation using alternate means?
---
Every now and then I do, rn my punch bowl is nuka roulette, sometimes buff?sometimes a trip, nobody knows
---
They haven't been domesticated by intentional selective breeding enough?
---
Now, try it with 0 carry weight. No armor, chems, weapons, etc. 
---
Just naked and afraid.
---
Yea been doing same thing since wastelanders dropped. Maxed both settled and raider rep, but like the quick Treasure notes. Fellow player also confirmed they have not gotten it in 3 days either
---
Exactly!
---
You might have just been on the receiving end of someone having a bad day. That, and some players might not even realise you could buy the cards/that it was 'your' event and thought you were just being 'lazy'.
---
I will note I've been getting steadily more frustrated with public servers for a few days now. More and more players, many of them high level and with good gear, have forgotten how to play or are just turning up and pretending to take part in events (shooting at the nearest enemy but not really caring) for the Event XP/to fulfil the challenge.
---
Line in the Sand is a good example. I was on a secondary/mule account trying to get the lunchboxes to use in group with my main during double xp; a level 22 character. More people than usually turn up for Scorched Earth were there. Yet, my level 22 unperked behind was managing to run around, shooting at every enemy that spawned, repairing the generator multiple times with my meagre scrap, practically John Wick-ing groups of Scorched, while at least a dozen level 100+ ran around and shot at seemingly nothing. Thing is, for all my ducking weaving, I didn't have the firepower to kill anything, despite trying my best.
---
On my commando I can jump onto that one wooden beam, sneak, and pretty much one-shot/two-shot the Scorched waves as they come, and solo the event with the generator taking only scratch damage from lucky shots taken on the approach.
---
I'm honestly at a loss to explain the massive difference in player skill/engagement I've seen in the last few days.
---
“dOnT TEll mE HoW To pLaY The GaMe“
---
I had the same issue and the same response from Bethesda
---
Keep orbital strike grenades to tag or destroy robot mobs
---
I wonder if we could contact support to get rid of them. I think I might try it.
---
You being there could be the reason they left. 
---
There is a paranoia about certain items destroying camps (not saying this is you at all and they had Vendors on but even I pay attention to whose at my camp)
---
They could of seen you and realised they max caps and panic quit. Haha
---
As in it will record eventually..?
---
I hate every npc except for Graftons Mayor (does he count?)
---
Thats the stupidest thing I've ever heard and sounds 100% like something Bethesda would do
---
You apologists are what enable them to make this game so bad
---
You have to charge the weapon after entering vats
---
I try not to bother them with inconveniences they have so many things to not fix.
---
Do any of the NPC's? I assumed they do like they do in FO4
---
Lol at the amount of misreads of Meal vs Meat haha glad you got it though.
---
Just look on the map for a camp with 50+ misc items for sale. Almost always it's either magazines or serums.
---
For me I’d complete a weekly score and it didn’t pop for 10 or so minutes but it’s been longer for you now so idk. Or it might have went through it just didn’t tell you. But I’m not sure exactly
---
There’s few events that offer multiple legendaries. I don’t see why you can’t just sit there and shoot some ghouls?
---
Notes will be worthless sooner than later, scrip will always be useful.
---
I build near point pleasant under a powerline ... Not exactly prime real estate 😂😂
---
&gt; What Bethesda apparently haven't factored in is that making it such a chore that people burn out or just give up can be devastating to their desire to play.
---
This
---
I have a life ive got 4 dogs I actively play competive mtg and still make time for this oh and I also work a full time job
---
First do some research before posting. There are no hackers in NW since 2 major patchs ago. The only third party software that was being used by hackers is outdated by weeks.
---
And Second, If they remove all afkers the time to start a New match ia going to increase a Lot.
---
I dont have a problem with the concept of a cap on certain things but I agree the daily scrip limit is WAY too low.
---
Still a gold bullion plan, but also dropping in world containers now. They are heavy, not particularly effective, and cannot be sold or dropped. That’s quite a hat trick if you think about it.
---
  Check out the Gib Studio line - easier on your wallet, and LH without a premium price.  
---
Some time back, picked up a LH Gib LP Studio (wine red) and a LH Gib Firebird Studio (silver starburst). Both were well under 1k.
---
  I’m sure by now you’ve seen the Iomi SG ? (yea, I know, its a Epi, but at least its made LH :)  IIRC, it has genuine Gib pups...and its unique in that its 24 fret instead of 22.
---
Yup because i have free time where apparently you dont and your her on reddit at the same time
---
You got a day one beta player that is sick and fucking tired of a triple a game developer that is so wealthy they blow their snot on wads of 100 dollar Bill's not being able to release new content without breaking the shit out of their game. The creation engine spaghetti code is holding together with scotch tape and prayers and the level of tech debt that has piled up on it from making fallout 4 into an mmo's has left it about as stable as Michael J Fox trying to deliver your dinner on rollerblades. I'm not "trolling". I am stating my opinion. Your time is better spent doing literally anything else. Wait until bethesda pulls their heads out of their ass, then you can consider giving their game a shred of your time.
---
Does anyone know if there is a list of notes and holotapes that either give a location or quest because I'd love to clear out the useless ones.
---
Thanks reddit fam!
---
honestly I enjoy the game "enough" not to care about what is sold in the atom store.  If I really want it or feel like I need it then Ill get it, but if I don't then I won't.  the lunchbox is honestly great just for getting an xp bonus comparable to sleeping in a bed, so I don't think its over the top OP or even close to it.  if they sold it like the repair kits I wouldnt care at all.  I farm the repair kits on SBQ every time I can, almost never run out of them they are so useful.
---
Thank you for letting me know how to engage, wise words from a self aware individual.

Best bug today after the wheel finally loaded
---
Had 10mm sub with 1k rounds and 26 loaded...
---
Tried to fire....
---
This is not the right ammo type...
---
Alt+f4'ed
---
Went to have coffee and cig to think of why this is so bugged
---
Sure
---
In nuke zones I have to throw on my stealth armor. Still getting use out of nerd rage and bloodied weapons.
---
If fighting SBQ out of nuke zone, sneak peeks are your friend. You can crouch under her and go to town.
---
Flashbacks to the hate mail my buddy received when we launched our first nuke dead center on fissure because we didnt know better...
---
&gt;  The Jet pack at least is explainable
---
But no longer justifiable.  Yes, it is explainable, in that fusion core is a fuel source and jet pack consumes fuel. 
---
But SS armor requires no fuel source at all and therefore does not consume fuel. 
---
Power armor jet pack is the only jet pack that requires a fuel source?
---
And no, I am not saying they should require SS to have fusion cores. I am saying let the damn jet pack work as it did in Fallout 4.   
---
So much of this game is a copy and past job from Fallout 4. So why the hell does Jet pack eat fusion core in Fallout 76 when it didn't in Fallout 4?  And yes, I have all three levels of power user. I had the same in Fallout 4 (when it was called Nuclear Physicist).
---
Stand on buildings it doesn’t f’ing matter.   If she aggros in you then move.....right back into the building.
---
Ward...
---
He broke free of his programming because of his power and chooses to walk the land unburdened by such trivial things like code.
---
I’ve heard maybe one or two, but that’s it. Not nearly like in 3&amp;4 lol
---
I'm perpetually confused about ants in this game. They don't seem that dangerous, but every time I encounter them fighting other creatures they win.
---
I’m the opposite, the new legendary run has completely put me off playing, cured my fomo for battlepass shit like this, and now I’m enjoying a bunch of games in my back log!
---
May even clear said backlog before the next console gen 🤣
---
Dude, this is the first season. I bet later on they'll start pushing those rewards later in the season.
---
The ammo-converter being level 5 (or whatever) is just to push how great seasons are.
---
And I'll be honest, I do like seasons as a tool for keeping people active BUT I hate how the answer for keeping me invested in Fallout 76 seems to always be "how can we make them grind"
---
Hell, Wastelanders as much as it made the game far more playable... ultimately was just a quest line to introduce a end-game currency that you have to grind for.
---
If you're already a bloodied build, a bloodied dcg already benefits more from the bloodied effect than the strength buff. I don't run unarmed as a rule, but I always keep a b/dcg just in case I run out of bullets, or my weapons break. In my css I can still do significant damage. I'm sure you can figure out which food/chem/booze/perk buffs to mitigate the lost strength.
---
what?!?!?!
---
sorry bro. that means you’ll never win the lottery or date a super model. your luck is all used up.
---
Nice job. I would happily share with a low level and have many a times. Psn bc_0100
---
Angry Turtle has a video titled...uh "FPS and Stutter Fix" and he has instructions and an .ini text to copy.
---
This would have been an awesome Legendary Run reward. I’m a little confused by their choices . A lot of items that don’t really fit the Captain Cosmos theme. I’d have liked to see it be all along the same theme.
---
I have never... I mean ever... Turned in public chat. Not once.
---
Never will.
---
Bu...but....but HER NAME IS RA RA
---
That's why I love this game.
---
Probably tomorrow, so grind it out as much as possible.
---
I doubt this will be fixed as it's an issue in Skyrim and FO4.
---
Disclaimer: I've got digital hoarding issues.
---
If you mean like, bloody mess, slugger, expert rifleman etc, yes.
---
Yes, they can be anywhere on the map.
---
1k club include melees? Or only guns haha
---
No it gives me 13% but that's because I have the herbivore mutation how do I make relish
---
Unyielding
---
😂 that's fine I have pixel jumpsuits 🙊🙊🙊. Best part I never noticed I had them till I was putting things to sell in my vendor and I saw the BOS jumpsuit. Too happy rn!
---
You are in fact lecturing people how to play. Please stop and take your own advice
---
kinda just seems like you want to check boxes for the sake of checking boxes.
---
It's delayed when I didn't get it i was confused but after a while playing i got the 1000 score when i was playing around completing events
---
Absolutely none of that statement made any sense at all.
---
Yes I do. Thanks. I'm away from the game for a bit and remember I'm the past wondering...
---
For RR, you have to collect ore that is on the walls inside all four irradiated rooms to complete it, and also to get the best rewards. You need atleast one of the workers alive as far as I know. Doesn’t matter if it’s 1 or 4 for max level rewards. 
---
Idk what the bare minimum required is off the top of my head, but 100 ore will complete the event and give you a chance at the hazmat suit and rad barrel plan. 0-xx (again, idk, think it’s less than 20) ore and it’ll fail. 
---
To get the max, atleast two people need to completely run all four rooms, and collect a few extra when they respawn. If more than two people run it, you can finish the event pretty quickly, *but don’t do that*. 
---
People want to farm the ghouls, so keep it below 100 until the last 10 seconds. It also spawns harder mobs like Deathclaws, Floaters, and Snallygasters at each reward level i believe, so if you have only a few people, holding onto your ore will make it easier to complete.
---
Full health unarmed builds are plenty viable, and you can use Junkie's, Furious, Executioner's, etc for your weapons and still get decent damage.
---
You just won't be able to one shot everything... but you also won't have to worry about dying if you're spotted.
---
33 and 50 are both in the second-to-highest tier of effects on commando weapons, with the highest tier being Explosive and FFR. 
---
33 and 50 both have reduced benefits on Bloodied weapons, and are more useful on Junkie's weapons. This is because Bloodied users should be using Unyielding armor which grants higher perception and vats accuracy. The 50 effect also has a more noticeable benefit on Junkie's weapons than on Bloodied weapons since the 50 effect only takes into account the base damage of the weapon rather than bonuses from the primary legendary effect.
---
As far as what people prefer on rifles, 3325 and 5025 and E25 and 2525 are all considered godrolls, as well as EFR and FFRFR when they don't want to use vats. But 3325 and 5025 are both in the same family as far as value (still underneath E25 and 2525), 33 for a little better accuracy and 50 for a little better damage (for crit builds).
---
Have you ever played a good pvp game with actual anti cheat and devs that care
---
The repeatable on the weekly list rolls over and resets every 10k exp. It never gets a check next to it to show it's been completed. Maybe you've just not noticed getting it. It would be really hard to have completed every daily without hitting 10k exp.
---
I think it's important for representation, that's all.
---
This is pretty much my feeling about it. If the rewards were not time limited I'd absolutely love it.
---
Had a random guy drop me one at drop site v9 earlier! They must be going around
---
Personally, I think future Legendary Runs should give a unique currency where you can purchase certain rewards from that Season.  Each rank gives more and more currency with Rank 100 giving enough currency to purchase everything in the run.  The more impressive items would have a higher cost, but can be obtained first.  So if you dislike the Ghillie skins, then there would be no reason to get to Rank 100 to get the items you want.  Of course, you would miss out on the other rewards like lunchboxes, scrip, atoms, and bullion.
---
Also 25.
---
Find 1 friend or player with first and ask to go to their world if you don't want to pay yourself. Explain you just wanna crack on with your stuff. Chances of meeting will be very very slim.
---
I’m at like 8000 now. I’m doing bare minimum, just the challenges. Possibly already hit it. Am I going to lose that 8000 when the weekly resets?
---
Holy cringe..
---
I wish ATHENA could live at my CAMP.  I can trade with her and I'm guessing she would do a better job killing molerats than Beckett.    
---
And she doesn't have nightmares.
---
I will! And you, my friend, avenge my fate by being your son a good dad ;)
---
Yes. Should include ALL ammo.
---
There's references to the Pitt in Wastelanders, so they may well be seeding it for the long haul.
---
10 😎
---
Nah, everyone else is right Bethesda actually came out and said the worded it badly and that you can only get score from event challenges not the events themselves
---
Go take a quick look, there is a new note and some changes, it's nice to see the progress starting. I just wish we had gotten the same for Foundation and Crater.
---
Burnt Tato 
---
130 Ballistic Damage
---
35 Energy Damage
---
35 Radiation Damage 
---
Crafting 
---
2 Wood(CONTROVERSIAL)
---
1 Oil
---
1 Salt
---
Also Burnt Tatos should also be a Fully Furious weapon, each consecutive hit doubles the damage no cap i want yo dwarf the queen AND a colossus with these things. Green Thumb should also give you double damage to start.
---
This has inspired me to say Bethesda SHOULD DEF ADD MORE THROWABLES AND GIVE US PERKS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTS AND DAMAGE OF THROWABLE WEAPONS!
---
(Also while we’re at it CORNSTALK SPEAR SKINS FOR HALLOWEEN THANKS)
---
GIVE ME IT I WANTTTITTTT
---
I WANT TO TAG PVP WITH PUBLIC EVENTS TEAMS OF PLAYERS NO HIGHER THAN LEVEL 34 AND IF THEY RETALIATE JUST FUCKIN PEG EM WITH TA AFTER TO AFTER TATO AFTER TO AFTER TA
---
What legacy?
---
Yea
---
Think I should go with automatic or non automatic? Worried about ammo consumption but I have first and can grind the ammo plant pretty easily. Never really done an automatic build before
---
I have had no issues getting the quests. Have both factions maxed out
---
I can’t even progress through Fun and Games. Every time I ask Ra Ra to crawl through the vent to open the door with the power armor inside she freezes once she gets inside. Doesn’t move at all. I’ve redone the quest four times and it still happens. Not sure what I’m gonna do.
---
Does anyone have a link to a good stealth build that works with this?
---
I've been full health since launch and always been tanking 2 to 3 pylons. I've recently switch to bloodied (Friday night) after getting a nice handmade from momma murma and I used carnivore, heaps of scorchedbeast meat and stims so I'll still take a pylon in nerd rage. With 8 or 9 people in the event and typically 7 of them never touching a pylon it does get a little frustrating that people rarely share the burdon. Once you've gotten your hits then death isn't a concern so grab a pylon and let the previous pylon taker a chance to get some hits. I'll only start the event now after a queen run where it seems everyone has the sh*t together
---
I hate it too.  Mainly because of the investment vs. reward ratio.  Once I got the Fixer for my rifle character, that was pretty much it for me.
---
Why bother with it?  So I can get another white wolf fedora and the same garbage drops that I get from 3 star ghouls?
---
I'm just here for the X-COM reference.
---
Thanks for confirming I guess this is a ticket then. Sadly I'm grtt errors on their support site...
---
Nice! It’s cool to see the kind of preferences certain people have! What kind of music do you play boss?
---
It’s only true for The Fixer and DLC weapons like the Sheepsquatch Club or Bear Arm. You can get standard weapons like Handmades or Gatling Guns, etc.
---
Right?!?
---
Especially if he gets to the wastelanders quest chain.
---
Will try. I know I dumped most of my notes once before but not sure of the results as I probly kept more than I really "Needed".
---
Hmmmm that’s odd
---
What platform?
---
I just keep strange in numbers on all the time. If someone else is already sharing it, then inspirational
---
This is the way. Gamers helping gamers.
---
Yes, they will show a difference. You can confirm this by removing all related damage perk cards, looking at the weapon’s base damage while equipped, then re-equip the cards and comparing again.
---
I just won a match solo and it feels pretty great, got a couple good captures too lol
---
Lol
---
I have had a few les paul studios. Weren’t really my jam! Not sure why. Ended up selling them all. Fenders are my sound, especially those short scale ones like the Jagstang/jaguar. I needed a thicker sounding guitar for the warmer songs my band does, so I figured I’d go SG. My drummer has one and his sounded amazing. This one is an SG modern! Not too bad compared to the other gibbys as far as price
---
Did it work?
---
Eh, I play and write a bit of everything but I'd say mostly metal/djent/progressive, lol.
---
Very cool, good spot and stance. Instead of just changing color/brightness, change stance/direction too. Give more options to what that place means.
---
You don't really buy gear in ESO. There are some wonderful crafted sets, but you'll also be relying on gear sets from dungeons and trials. Smithing is a grind, but here are the basics: make sure you are always researching as many traits as possible. Break down any gear you aren't actively using (and everything before lvl 50 cp160 should be broken down as you out level it). Do your crafting writs every day. Once you do them enough, you'll pretty well have the writs memorized and you can fly through them in 5 minutes or less. That's basically it!
---
Sadly Fallout 76 ia not a PvP game
---
I am 100pct certain that the zealots prefix applies to the sbq, the hunters prefix is iffy, however.
---
Unless you’re Bloodied Sneak, you’re pretty much not helping at all. 
---
If you choose to barely help and sit on the roof, atleast take a pylon.
---
Awesome.
---
I stopped at 13. Nothing I really want on the board anyway.
---
22
---
Would love that!
---
If you are on xbox I saw one camp awhile back next to the Whitesprings railstation. Had like 50 obviously duped The Fixer plans for 3k.
---
Don't think anyone has been officially banned for using mods. 3rd party hack tools? Occasionally. Duping? Doesn't seem like it much anymore.
---
Been running some basic mods since shortly after the games release.
---
I have mixed feelings on the two of them. Ra-Ra is well done, and is a convincing betrayal of annoying, bratty kid. ...however, that means she's an annoying bratty kid, which made it easier for me to side with the settlers. I found Gail just annoying, and her voice didn't help at all. It felt very half-assed, to be honest. Not at all like what a super mutant should sound like.
---
Haven’t started.
---
Aw, darn I'm on PS4.
---
In PVE most enemies have a more vulnerable limb - often the head, but not always - if you hit that limb you will do A flat damage increase (double damage iirc) ...
---
I will help...I think u can buy the hm plans...I'm not on right now, bit will be in an hr.
---
Gt: dr teeth 69r md
---
I want to adopt ra ra, like you could in Skyrim.
---
Why are you so heavily downvoted? Did you really need to put a /s?
---
It's a challenge over 10 weeks, it's still week 1... No I'm glad it's 100 levels.
---
And what exactly is the difference between you killing it instantly or waiting? 
---
You can’t finish the event quicker, and the last legendary spawns with 2~ mins left in the event. You have *no* sensible reason for not allowing everyone to tag it, and you’re a douchebag for trying to argue against it.
---
I had already done that. Trying to get Kindred Spirit back. They’ve lost that loving feeling :)
---
I believe it's just damage, as well as thinking the freeze effect is based off crit chance/hit
---
You can be solo but join a team.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That turns off Lone Wonderer, but you still get the +2 special from Herd mentality, +1int (for exp) if its a building team.
---
This is a great idea, or maybe not directly maybe just be able to convert purified water into a storage of sorts and see how much you have every time you take a drink, or in camp
---
OP out here counting mexicans making sure todd isnt racist lmao.
---
oh you mean 95% pointblank with automatic shotgun via vats and all 20 shots missed?! oh ya that 5% super strong today.
---
Well she is a female super mutant so she won’t sound anything like strong or fawkes.
---
A named variation of the combat rifle that always has:
---
Improved stealth. Faster sneaking movement speed. 
---
Once you learn the plans you can find legendary version.
---
26.5. I noticed that I am also taking more damage.  If blocker is broken, that would explain it.  Thank God for Serendipity and Lifegiver.
---
PC mate :)
---
Do you happen to know if the winter coat comes after the skele suit in terms of xp? And also how does it look?
---
I'm PS4
---
G.E.N.E - Gene Ene Ne E
---
Warframe, a FTP game for which I didn’t pay AAA sticker price, is less grindy than this buggy dumpster fire. It’s easier to max Fortuna standing than the eye-clawing boredom of maxing raider/carpetbagger standing (well, setting aside raider exploits).
---
Most of the time when o do the event i will tell people that i can kill the boss in one wave as long as long as someones soing the pylons. And most of the time im just going in circles kyting the boss around while everyone else dose nothing and its just stupid i go through 20-30 stims every event and im not even a pylon holder. I think with how this game is its just not worth it to do that event at all with fixer plans not having as much of a value as they used to be and you only get some notes and a couple repare kits. And it also cost like over 2k for the things while the queen can be free or like 100 or so caps for the card and you can skip 90 percent of it if you know what your doing. And when you kill her you get 2 legendarys 1 being a garenteed heavy 2 star combat part which is great and the other being random from her. Also 5+ of random flux pluse 2 or more plans. So ya i think with the difficulty and price of doing the imposter ita just not worth it at all the best thing you can get is a fixer plan and there not worth much any more while if you do the queen while also spending little to no caps to spawn her.
---
If u ran it as Intended, ie: find all the right codes, decipher them, then run it...it could be more rewarding...just saying
---
Ad victorium!
---
Nuclear winter is.
---
You’re not much help anyway if you can’t do enough damage to get rewards by the time she dies lol. 
---
You don’t need a magic gun to get rewards either.
---
You got it ;)
---
Super mutants, typically, are sexless, so there wouldn't be much distinction. Tabitha and Lily in New Vegas have booming intense voices that rival the likes of Fawkes or Marcus, and they were female before being dipped in FEV. Some super mutants in Fallout 3 (in which they all share the same voicetype) mention that they were possibly women.
---
Hunters and Zealots work on SBs and The SBQ. Same with Scorched animals. Hunters won't effect scorched zombies though.
---
Same. I just freeze for a few seconds and for the first time I have been getting that fast travel bug.
---
Thanks
---
20, missed one day of dailies but doing ok rank wise for now.
---
Lol...no...it even says on the card....
---
And it's usually started by a level 30 not knowing what happens
---
Source: I did that too
---
It comes way after, I still haven't unlocked it. Probably 4 or 5k ish XP in as well, I was told it's 7k after hat.
---
What you see is what you can unlock from finding or buying plans. Atom shop items are added after you buy them.
---
battle passes aren't good and i don't care if other games get away with it i just don't want it at all
---
Because the idea for getting us to play the game is always "what grind mechanic can we introduce" even wastelanders was nothing but a huge grind.
---
The Brotherhoods arrival will probably be followed... by more grind
---
MTX and GaaS models aren't okay and consumers should be against them.
---
Wait..got confused on question....nevermind
---
Yes but that was written way before public teams were a thing
---
in this case it really ruins the gameplay, some perks involve teamwork etc. It also makes the gameplay even more cynical and repetitive. I tried to get into the meta of fighting over the stack of jumping folks on the rocks at morgantown, but because not everyone is in on it as a thing it isn't really fun. Also, you can build a concrete floor on top of them to protect them.
---
Its the VATs charge up bug. it effects all charge up weapons, the gauss weapons and the bows, the crossbow doesnt charge up. If you miss the 95% chance exit and enter vats and try again. Currently theres no point in using charge up weapons if you want to use them in vats cause vats is broken with charge up weapons. Its the oldest bug in the game, its always been an issue with the gauss rifle, you'd think they'd fix the bug before making 90% of the newest end game weapons charging weapons.
---
Alright sounds fun! What system do you play on?
---
Ah okay I see haha. Don’t worry
---
You're a heavy weapons build with only a 1 in strength? Jesus...it's a wonder you hit anything...
---
Oh sorry I dont live up to your standards
---
I watched a video on YT.. (I know.. I was bored) and a guy was having this problem.  He Blueprinted the item and then he could place the blueprint.  He did the same for many different items that were failing to place, and they all then worked.  Might be worth a try.
---
Atom shop stuff has atoms logo next to them. Everything else is in game plans.
---
I officially gave up on the game after doing dailys for a week. I use to do them everyday for atoms. Prob check the game back out when the new event drops
---
I saw the video of that with the wood armour. Anyone know if the higher tier ones work any better?
---
It’s best to run it after SBQ. That way you can gauge how strong the lobby is by how quickly she dies. 
---
If it goes quickly, run Encryptid asap before they server hop.
---
That's alright, thanks anyway man :)
---
If I had the option to shoot Ra Ra I would have
---
In my experience this is directly caused by having too many items in inventory. Gradually as you add more and more items, anything that accesses an inventory list (weapon wheel, cooking/repairing/vendor/stash etc.) get slower and slower.  To be clear, it’s the high number of individual items. The game doesn’t care if you have 1000 steel because that is one item. But if you have 100 outfits, that’s 100 individual items the game is reading EVERY TIME you do anything that accesses inventory.
---
Even getting rid of non-important notes, holotapes, and misc. items can make a big difference.  To be clear, this isn’t a computer hardware issue. It’s a shitty, beyond old, patched together-garbage of a pile of code software issue.  It’s what happens when code that was designed to only ever be used for single player gets forced into an online multiplayer world.
---
Or make loots glowing??
---
Stealth armor buddy
---
Whats a good sniper build
---
There is quite a bit of speculation that Fawkes was, in fact, female
---
I guess this will replace the 100 score for 10000 xp.  Dang.
---
i did search for that, and all that came up was people asking for cross platform (console to pc). nothing to do with bethesda launcher and steam
---
That is not even what I’m remotely asking friend. I’m asking if weapons could be rebalanced. For example: the Alien Blaster. It’s a terrible weapon with terrible damage. I’m asking if certain weapons, like the AB, will get significant rebalances as a part of One Wasteland.
---
English is built on slang and understanding background context to help shape how you perceive the words being said to you and you cant admit to the fact that someone might use a phrase differently than what your "learned" ass might know? And that it is indeed a socially accepted version of it? And you brag about teaching. :/
---
Tell me you're on Xbox? i get this weird primal satisfaction from tanking that goat, after taking all 3 pylons haha
---
Edit: Your card, your rules dude.  The only thing that gets to me is if me or a friend starts the event, we're waiting for people to show, but some nit-wit goes ahead and initiates the recall too early.  If it's not your recall card, DO NOT touch that terminal.
---
Edit 2: spelling, smh
---
Well, maybe. I can use my bloodied 10mm for almost everything. The issue is AGI is used for pistol, sneak, and adrenalin perks.
---
I believe it has to do w ur weight....when u die, u "lose" ur perks from cards and armor....and, when over weight u can only spawn at v76...not 100% sure...but it's my guess
---
No, she's still classified as scorched, otherwise prime wouldn't affect her like it does.
---
Here's my Stealth Archer build.  Bows are completely silent, unlike suppressed weapons.  They benefit from Mr. Sandman and Cover Operative as well.  This is a bloodied build that uses Aim Down Sights (no VATS).  This allows for a slower, more deliberative game play that makes the pacification perks more usable.  If you've played a lot of VATS, ADS is a very different experience.  You'll gain new respect for a pack of mole rats...
---
[The Tribal Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f19be5&amp;d=a51ao0an2ar2lt2l71pv2pu2pt2pn2pe2a04sv0ir2ib4cu2cv2c02il2e00&amp;w=ic4p10pa0p80p90c52at1i11&amp;m=fce012a&amp;n=The%20Tribal)
---
I think I was there? Was he using an explosive tesla rifle?
---
Wrong forum?
---
It’s not the other stuff like magazines and bobbleheads that slow it down. It’s the game trying to register the mods and conditions of weapons and armor that really bear down on the lag
---
I can expand this slightly.  The Explosive effect does not directly affect the queen, but it does serve to  double the effective fire rate relative to the bug.  If you have a minigun that has a 150 or whatever it is fire rate, explosive would double that and trigger the bug.  No need for the accelerated barrel if you have explosive.
---
I've seen the SBQ frozen in midair so I'm guessing a Zealots Cryolator would come in handy.
---
Items currently on the atom shop will also show up, but will have an nuclear atom icon on them
---
Otherwise, yes, everything else in there is items you can get either from buying, getting as rewards, or from events.
---
I haven’t had issues BUT I have replaced the normal HDD with an SSD
---
You do know that people can buy your serums and sell them at a train station for 350-450, depending on their charisma, right?  500 is the recommended floor for their sale.
---
Gotcha. So everything I can see (non-atom), is everything that I can build eventually. There are no more non-atom plans that will appear or unlock as the game progresses, correct? 
---
Just asking because I hope there are more to unlock, but totally understand that the interesting stuff is locked behind atoms
---
You know this wasted time could be spent earning score but that would be traumatic to realise enjoy being a beta siimp
---
No rep right? Are you on PC?
---
If any of us were 100% what caused it we’d all be fine and easily avoiding it.
---
When score dailies reset sometimes they autocomplete.  The consensus seems to be to not be logged into the game when the challenges rolls over, but many have found that doesn’t help.
---
Nigga what
---
BOS dailies seem to reward them often, also the power station events and power station workshops.
---
I hope someone does.
---
Best kids in the wasteland and how a role model father
---
I wish you didn't have to restart for it to fix it, kinda annoying especially when you have a workshop that you claimed.
---
How sulo? I always have the item and get double scrip
---
Yeah I was unsure what to put there I kept clicking different things but it won’t let me do anything
---
Since Patch 20 I haven't been able to get a single hit on the SBQ
---
For me, I put on PA, which i rarely use elsewhere, take all 3 pylons then go for the sheepsquatch head on with a TRO E combat rifle, while spamming the favourite key for stims hahaha
---
Yikes! Guess I’m playing Nuclear Winter quite a bit longer then... Thanks for the info, appreciated!
---
I seem to remember you can get it by going through a hole i the attic.
---
Yeah I read that too, but for the life of me can’t find the hole. All I read is it’s in the Mr. Handy showroom which is behind a level 1 lock pick.
---
If you can get 4-5 people, one to tank, and as many as possible with guass weapons, it's a breeze  :)
---
Sometimes they will pop up in ammo boxes.
---
that includes wastelanders weapons like the guass minigun or cattle prod
---
I recently maxed out settler rep, ward decides now is the perfect time to keep giving me the quest over and over again lol every time I hop servers it pops up, wished it had happened before
---
also, have it operate security systems like the standard terminal so you don't have to build both
---
And plasma cores. At least let us scrap them!
---
I use a handmade and railway primarily and keep a combat rifle as a third.  The choice in my opinion would be whatever would be the best legendary for your build.  For example, I would choose a handmade over a combat (non legendary). But if I got a furious explosive combat rifle, that would trump any non legendary handmade; and I would use that until it broke mid combat.
---
He keeps giving me the quest I’m getting so much stuff from it it’s awesome
---
* Long Shot: So the damage drop off at range is not massive.
---
* Master Rifle: Obviously.
---
* Tank Killer: To ignore 36% armor is good.
---
* Ironclad: You need some form of protection.
---
* Chem Fiend (Optional): Psychos will make it so you can 1 shot PA users since chems don't last long.
---
* Body Guards (Optional): More resistance if you have a full reliable team.
---
* Frog Legs: This perk helps mainly in Morgantown to get a height advantage to scope out the area.
---
* Goat Legs (Optional): This is a great perk if you are in high elevation areas and you gotta make a quick escape like in Flatwoods bridge or off the buildings in Morgantown.
---
* Bloody Mess: It is basically required.
---
I recommend a Hunting Rifle until you find a Scoped Lever Action, Scope Laser sights are inconsistent when aiming for the head.
---
A Submachinegun, Auto Combat Rifle, 10MM SMG, or Handmade as a secondary for close quarters, a crossbow is required for the AI. Wood Armor to help blend into bushes.
---
I think by rebalancing they're talking about One Wasteland, which will introduce better level scaling
---
farm them at poseidon honestly. most people wont pvo you and the enemies that attack you are low level there. just sit back and collect cores.
---
Bush wookie is fun as well when you pay attention as squads pass by. Not so much when grinding levels/challenges.
---
Is that a figurine? Im talentless sadly, but both guitar and figurine, if thats what it is, bitchin...
---
Note: everything I say here is pure speculation based on my experience with the strangler heart.  Take it as such.

It seems that the strangler heart is very similar to the new Wendigo Colossus in that its damage resistance gets higher the faster you apply damage to it.  It gets stronger the harder you hit it.  If you take an OMG hax super duper weapon and mow it, it won't die.  It gets damaged and then heals and won't take much more damage for a while.  You will have much better success damaging it slowly, but not so slow that you aren't overcoming its regen ability.  In my experience, I've had the most success with lower powered, non ffr high capacity weapons.  It can also be killed pretty easily with one person just hammering it with a DCG or Power Fist.  I do about 10K damage to it with my unspec'ed Bloodied  Power Fist without buffs, and that seems to not trigger the huge DR boost.  It dies pretty quickly using that method.
---
FWIW.  Good luck.
---
Ahh thanks bud!
---
Ah you broke have a nice night
---
This. I run bloodied and will quite often take two pylons, it seems impossible for me to hold 3 for any length of time. I go through a shit tonne of stimpacks, I don't mind as I have shit tonne of stimpacks. But I'm at best a 50% chance of getting any damage in on her. I'll keep doing it though as I enjoy the event but a better chance at the loot sure would be nice (I'm all good on fedoras, for like ever). And it can never be said enough, don't start the event if you didn't buy the recall card 🤦‍♂️

Pumpkin grenades? 😈
---
There are 2 types of bush wookies.
---
1. The ones who only hide and don't do nothing.
---
2. The ones who wait for their pray and strike at the right and precise moment.
---
I take out squads when they are fighting or looting OR LOOKING AT THEIR PIPBOY IN THE OPEN!!!
---
17 or 18 happy as hell :3
---
You say that as im just hunted down repeatedly by the impostor as soon as I spawn 8 times in a row :)
---
Added
---
I call that little maneuver "The Fasnacht Special"
---
What kind? I’m new to gaming on pc and I’m still learning
---
Gonna try to grind it out myself as well, I should br fairly close. Oh yeah it looks like the winter coat and jeans outfit with a orange/blue recolor.
---
That's a really good idea. I just wish bethesda's definition of a clean sink was the same as a lot of other peoples. I have a friend that got the sink believing he was going to get fresh clean water out of it.
---
dont think so.
---
it will most likely be focused on normalizing damage so that a level 10 and level 100 player do a sorta similar amount of damage so that they can explore the whole map whenever they want
---
So is that... 0.0125%? Or sorry 95% /s
---
Some players seem so oblivious to loot and open pip boys like sitting ducks. Easy pickings with any scoped rifle from afar in a nice plant.
---
Nice
---
I’ve also noticed a big difference in damage taken also.
---
Level 20 score
---
Beats my offer of a free bottle of Nukashine and a loaded .44 revolver...
---
That sounds like a "my buddy" to me
---
Theres a hole in the ceiling of the Mr handy showroom you can get up into that will have a note that will have the password to the Assaultron showroom on it
---
You're on 100?
---
To both, it breaks Rule 6. No trading on the sub.
---
Use the market pages.
---
You are making good progress. I am almost 19. Just gotta sit in this bush a little longer...
---
But the Mr. Handy showroom is behind a level 1 door.
---
Ah cool, thanks for verifying!
---
id have to disagree with the concept of this being "free dlc".  its the same challenges as before.  
---
free cosmetic stuff, sure.  but i wonder how fewer we're gonna be getting random icons, or outfits from the atom shop anymore.  they're free to make money, but damnit, give me something for my filthy lucre that isnt just warmed over crap.  and if thats whats supposed to support the game, to what end?  more quests, characters, ways to impact the world?  no, we spend a lot of time on the ui of this game board, which has no tangible impact on the world, the story, or your play experience of it.  admittedly, many of the rewards are interesting (eg clean sink), but id like more stuff like biv (instead of just a plopped in mechanic of alcohol crafting, a story, new locations, and recipies) in contrast, ,a number of taskd lists for players to complete.
---
thats not even mentioning how the score isn't being awarded 1/3rd of the time or completion conditions aren't registering.  maybe im just  salty that i just lost two hours of "work" on a challenge that didnt register, or the fact that now the game feels like work when playing it.  idk, we'll see how things play out in future seasons
---
Hopefully that chicken coop grants another “camp companion.”
---
Yes it worked, thanks!
---
Do you want me to give you a hint?
---
Some items (example - certain mounted heads) can only be obtained during seasonal events. Meat week, Halloween, Christmas, etc. So you can see all that's available, but some cant be rewarded at the time. Check player vendors for those.
---
It worked for me as soon I joined a the team, thanks!
---
I hadnt specifically noticed regarding the perk but I have noticed a few times where I seem to be running out of AP when normally I wouldnt so it could well be that not working as it should
---
It did, thanks!
---
I really want to get into Warframe but it seems to have a helluva learning curve to get good lol
---
Sure.
---
It does
---
They never learn, and then their friend walks up to the confused and tries to revive them, and boom, 2 people are down and they don't know what is going on, then the 3rd guy tries a big brain move and uses a stealthboy, but he is too late and I finish the job not risking getting duked by 3 pissed of players.
---
I don't even know how you're supposed to do that event. The Imposter Squatch literally one shots me every time it looks at me. It's legit harder than the Queen. Do ou need 500 ER to survive it?
---
Thanks, I have heard both that hunters does and doesn't work, but all that info is over a year old. 
---
I get that there is a damage boost, but is there a corresponding freeze boost?
---
Yep that's where I ended up. I picked up 3 cards this morning to give me a little breathing room on my cap limit
---
This hardcore mode. I will be doing this for sure soon.
---
There is a keypad to the left of the door to the assaultron. If you read papers in the office, it will give you the code.
---
I think we should only be occasional rescuers and generous givers of things that seem scarce to them but are trivial to us.
---
I made it by without that. Granted that was pre tse nerf
---
Xbox. Feel free to dm me for my gamertag if you're on Xbox!
---
Chaotic neutral much?
---
Darn, got it in PC
---
No, it is the combination of everything in your inventory. It is true that weapons and armors are *heavier,* but it is possible to experience issues without a single weapons or armor piece.
---
IMO, crossbows with explosive frames and a  "Bloodied", "Instigating" or "Two Shot" prefix are viable if combined with the proper bow/crossbow perks, at a minimum. Other perks and mutations to increase damage won't hurt with these weapons... Combined with stealth, you can one-shot all but bullet sponges. I personnaly enjoy using them in 3rd person as aiming in first person does not work well.
---
here you are thinking I got more than 1 charisma
---
&gt;There are players that run full.health builds so that's what they should be doing, we all have our part.
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/453/872/091.gif
---
Theres a key to the Mr handy showroom on a shelf in a room somewhere near Skinner. The room is a level 0 picklock
---
Of the red assaultron you can’t interact with?
---
No worries! Head over to the ESO sub. There are a ton of people on there who are way better at ESO than I, and you should be able to find plenty of PC players
---
Thanks for all the help and info by the way
---
I have one in my vendor on Xbox for 500c, it’s been there for about 4 days. I’m assuming everyone just overlooks it since most vendors on Xbox are filled with millions of duped holiday event plans nowadays and (known) plans all start to look the same unless they’re priced stupidly high.
---
I did it on an alt at level 25.  It wasn't terribly hard.  I would recommend a weapon with more fire rate than a hunting rifle though.  I did it as a stealth commando.  At minimum you might want to at least install the hair trigger receiver and use the speed demon mutation.  I have not verified this, but some say that ground pounder affects rifles even though it shouldn't.
---
Another option, Lever Action, the favorite of Rifleman builds for a reason.  Instigating Lever for the big win. 
---
I’m partial to comando builds, but I’d take the handmade over a hunting rifle any day. Getting around the map quickly gives me a sense of satisfaction, or accomplishment.   I know others like setting up those distance shots from cover, taking their sweet time.
---
I go to Nexus Mods, I use TZ Map.  Better than the vanilla.
---
It’s not awful, just not at all covered in-game. A couple YouTube videos on modding frames/weapons and you’ll get sufficient knowledge to solo anything normal gameplay throws at you. Soloing higher level stuff for hours on end is a different story, but there’s no reward scaling so it’s just a measuring contest anyway. Graphics are nice, faux sense of progress is there, plat is easy enough to trade for so spending $ is optional...just kinda empty story-wise.
---
I usually take as many of the pylons as are available. Sometimes someone beats me to one. Usually 5-10 Nuka Cola Quantum and about the same Stimpaks gets me through, but I usually make sure I get at least one shot in. If I am there at the beginning then there is a few seconds before the pylons become active when I can hit him once or twice before he goes invisible, but if not I start running for him as soon as I have the last pylon.
---
Handmade hands down. I've used all variations of rifles. What you REALLY should care about, is the type of legendary Handmade you use :)   it depends on how you mod them. I see them sold at vendors often, or like myself, was blessed with a sweet drop.   OH, Handmade for short/mid range... but a Gauz rifle for Long range :)
---
Gotcha.  Where does the legendary handmade drop?  Farm White Springs I take it?
---
&gt;No other BP is like this.
---
List one.
---
You can also get acid from cave crickets in Tanagra town
---
I use it to fast travel when I’m too overweight and too far from camp.
---
Yes, almost every end game PvPer will have this going on. There are alot of exploits and bugs regarding PvP. And it works always regardless of server.
---
Theres a glitch with them atm
---
I have never used a cryolator before and took it to a queen fight. I was pretty underwhelmed with it- I used about 150 rounds and she slowed a little but that's it... I think you may be right.
---
Happy to help!
---
Yeah I sold the ultracite emergency protocols for 49c, twice 🤦‍♂️
---
Up the stairs behind Skinner to the Assaultron showroom
---
not everyone is going to have enough charisma points to share a perk though. You need at least 3 in charisma.
---
Uh no lol
---
I think you may be right.  I've also noticed my AP seems to regen very slowly lately.  Been eating honey to help.
---
The Blocker perk is also apparently broken in addition to Adrenaline.  Geez, it seems all my go-to perks have stopped functioning.
---
\^
---
I tried playing last night from a place with bad wifi and got no loot from a SBQ and a 3 star mutant suicider and decided I should wait until I get home to play :(
---
We all can agree that vats is broken.
---
I heard two shot freezes faster but havent gotten a hold of one to test, i do have a quad ffr though which is pretty clutch.
---
Not that you asked for it, but advice for Tanking, wear PA and spam the hotkey for stims lol, bring A LOT lol
---
Edit: What system are you on?
---
In my private server inspirational didn't seem to work. I was getting the same xp with or without perk.
---
Can you confirm it works even in a public team by yourself?.
---
I’m stil at 3 but I don’t get to play every day.
---
It’s just random, any legendary has a chance of dropping one.
---
I wish it existed cuz i accidently drunk the carnivore serum and i have around 10 certain mutations and im afraid i would lose so many of my good mutations before i lose the carnivore mutation.
---
if you're an enclave general the shop keep gives you the key card. alternatively you can kill him and get the key to the first room and in there you get the key to the second room.
---
Oh okay I see. 
---
I can, but first in a couple of hours or so.
---
Choo Choo my brother.  One of my absolute favorite weapons in the game.  I have a BE90 and it is unstoppable.  Crazy range (if modded right), good accuracy, hits like a truck.  And the best sound effect of them all!
---
If the system is working correctly you don’t need to spend atoms to make your way through the board... don’t fall victim to bad math. Stay in school. 
---
Anyway...Sorry about the bug...
---
23, i fell short of my goal
---
I actually welcome it, it's a nice change from SBQ and *go fetch me that* aka faction dailies. 
---
Gets le to do different things i never would otherwise like grouping with people (im solo as much as i can), capture workshops or go out of my way to do something specific.
---
I think its a fun event, I show up when I see someone else there, but i definitely can’t solo it or even “couple” it just yet, but with at least 4 folks there it’s pretty fun, wish more participated in events sometimes, the new season has helped, and at first it was amazing due to it being a daily, but now it’s often not a daily (maybe like do 2 events or something, not enough to encourage mass participation); they need to make events give out season points.
---
I always switch to the Chinese Stealth Suit for nuke zones. You take a hit to Strength, but if you’re running Bloodied and have a Bloodied unarmed weapon, you’ll still be doing considerable damage, especially if you have the Carnivore mutation and are stacking food.
---
I also find the CSS more effective than a full set of Unyielding for sneaking as a melee character. Yesterday, I took on the SBQ with roughly a dozen other players, and I was able to sneak up under her and take half of her health bar in one landing. I’ve never been able to do this with a full set of Unyielding and so many other players around.
---
Im always im power armor, and stims cant save me from insta dying the second i respawn and walk over to the event. Its almost comical how much that robot hates me. My friend says my shiny red rocket armor makes it mad lol
---
You likely gained the SCORE when you completed 3/5 of your weekly. I'm pretty sure it's happening to everyone.
---
What’s the battle pass? I’ve only heard of seasons. Is there a pass you can buy that I’m missing?
---
I put one for free once. I must have made someone happy.
---
I've stood watch over dead players' loot 'till they Respawned and never felt the need to pick it all up and then make them beg to get it back.  "Nice" would not be my description.
---
What kind of mods did you apply?
---
Yaaa
---
I’ve been GRINDING for the Responders firefighters outfit, hitting all the events. I got the exact same lineup of items in 1 day too, but still no white fire helmet.
---
Also, making any heavy weapon ammo takes a metric fuckton of steel, too. To get this, I recommend farming as many enemy encampments as possible for their weapons. Even if you’re encumbered by the end, make sure to pick up EVERY weapon, as most of them will recycle into around 12 steel each.
---
Well there's all the survival challenges and stuff they added newly, and the old ones, and they either give 40-80 atoms per usually, so you basically just need to grind them and the S.C.O.R.E system for atoms.
---
I wrote [a guide for people](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hk3993/my_leadgrabbing_route_to_help_others/) that do not have or do not use Excavator to help them find lead.
---
I half agree but they somehow need to keep a good retention rate of their playerbase. It looks better to investors if you show them that Bob logs in every day even if it's only for 5mins at a time.
---
I have never had the Last Death marker not show up, even when I died by falling through the game surface texture or into a Scorch hole.  Not only that, I didn't get a choice of where to Respawn.  Just a countdown and I was back on West Tec's front door.  Did a quick recheck of all the corpses while I was looking for my stuff and did not find anybody "new."  I had only picked up ammo and left the rest.  Everybody still had the rest of their stuff.
---
You can grind the "lifetime" challenges still if you have any left to do. Outside of whatever is awarded in the Seasons, thats the only other way to earn free atoms now
---
EDIT: Why was this downvoted? What part of what i said is not true?
---
I just love that there is no premium version of the BP.
---
Thank you, I completely agree with you, Bethesda’s battle pass is already easier than most and you don’t have to buy anything you just play and get whatever free rewards you can within whatever time limit is reasonable to you and I think it’s great they offer free alternative cosmetics and camp items like this or just playing as opposed to buying them in the atom store.
---
You don't I suppose 
---
I don't mind too much, the game has tons and tons of cosmetics you can get for free 
---
What were you wanting to grab from the atom shop?
---
Hope you needed to learn the plan and aren't reselling it. I've been selling my extras for 500 and all three so far were earned the hard way.
---
I personally, don't like the way Levers reload and fire... something about the timing bugs me. oh, i'm a rifleman build as well.   I just prefer the damage of the Gauz for long and the speed and amount on the Handmade. The Lever is a good middle of those, I feel.
---
Yeah when you get 3/5 sometimes the challenge completes
---
Thanks to both you and Ikki_Makko. I got it!
---
I've been running into the occasional stealth gutsy lately. I hate him
---
I placed a bathtub in front of the tap of my indoor purifier, to imply my wasteful need to wash in the purest of water!
---
For the first time ever, I missed two straight melee attacks in VATS today. I didn’t even think it was possible to miss in VATS with melee.
---
Thanks for the tip. Just watched it.
---
Indeed the gap is not big but mainly because of the lvl 5 Adrenaline (as he stated, it's a key part). I run lvl 1 adrenaline (most cost-effective) vs him with lvl 5 adrenaline (most damage).
---
The difference between lvl 1 and 5 is a max of +24% damage which is similar to the Nerd Rage +20% so up to that point it's kind of a tie.
---
Tenderizer (+7% dmg) could push the balance in favor of the full health build but with 4 CHA you can use lvl3 tenderizer instead of lvl 3 Lone Wanderer. But i think this tradeoff is not necessary (and when playing on a party other people might already be using Tenderizer)
---
The difference from a bloodied build is that you have [Adrenal Reaction giving you +50%](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8vld2/adrenal_reaction_in_numbers/) and [bloodied giving about +80% dmg](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6l4v1/how_the_bloodied_legendary_effect_works/ebw1dfa?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) which are very significant bonuses. So those 2 bonus can make a difference because they can work ON TOP of the 25% faster fire rate effect.
---
I only got my hands on a 25FFR Gauss Minigun. Still looking for 25FFR on other heavy guns as it's definitely an awesome effect.
---
You can even move some STR/ENDpoints from my build to agility to get max Adrenaline but again i don't think the survival-DPS tradeoff is necessary (but could be done for more insane DPS.
---
What i did find very interesting is that the instigating effect works for more than 1 round in Heavy Guns!In overall Heavy Guns are great for DPS in many ways and it was nice to see a full health build and how it can still be very powerful. Maybe gonna give it a try when i got spare points.
---
The fact you noticed when 95% of the people that post don’t makes me feel better about my fellow vault dwellers.
---
Fixer plans are pretty common, I'm not surprised to be honest.
---
Completing the season will net you 2000 Atoms. There are also still all the other challenges that award them—character, world, combat etc.
---
Yes
---
The risk is that if perked improperly, I can die from a bloatfly.
---
also make sure you have ammosmith and super duper maxed perk cards when you make the ammo, it doubles the amount you make and super duper gives a chance to double it again
---
I shouldn't get killed for lockpicking something thats just dumb i understand players houses but workshops were a stupid idea.
---
We've been asking for this since venders were a thing!
---
That's awesome. I can't imagine how good of a feeling that is. Good job, dad *vault boy thumbs up*
---
Say what!?!? Gotta check this out burrows is a great scrip gainer.for me haven't done it lately as Ive bought my scrip recently.
---
I agree. People need to chill out.  At the end of the day, it's only a video game.
---
This is so sweet!
---
My junkies explosive FMSWA railway is my favorite gun, I don’t understand why they aren’t more popular!  My automatic does 285 dmg per round!!!  That’s just crazy, combined with the nearly zero vats cost it’s just amazing and so satisfying.  I don’t need stealth when I’m hitting these numbers.  Choo choo$
---
Seasons is the same kind of concept as what other games call battle passes, which can be free or paid for
---
So people are calling it a battle pass because that's the common term for this kind of thing
---
First time I went to the mire I was savaged by those little bastards, I did not go back for some time. It gets better but yeah you gotta get your DPS up to deal with a flock of those things
---
definitely slower than before. gonna unequip it for now.
---
Hundreds?
---
So far I can get about 100 every day and a bit from farming the wild ones, but it's a pain in the ass to gather and wild plants take far too long to respawn.
---
When you take into account the free atoms from the season, and just a typical weeks worth of atoms, we lost about 80% of free atoms.
---
I’d wager Zenimax put the kibosh on all the free atoms, since this is the only way they can make recurring money outside of first.  It makes first more alluring and is way to squeeze money from those that want to fix the season.
---
To be clear, in general, I may not like that mindset, but it makes sense and I’d understand it if that is why it’s moved to this.
---
It’s a 1/12th figure by ThreeZero!
---
i wanted to save up atoms this summer to buy halloween stuff when they come out
---
Hey. Thanks for the tip. I'll keep that in mind!
---
Mainly because inclusivity is 100% better and more consumer friendly than exclusivity.
---
I'm restarting Fallout now to see if it will let me inside. I agree, great xp/scrip location
---
I haven’t faced too many issues since the update, but Scorched Earth rendered the game practically unplayable for my buddy the other night. I’m not sure why this affects some players more than others.
---
At least it's foreshadowed by the clean sink in the Overseers house also giving dirty water lol
---
Are serums under misc? Because I have been hitting camps with lots of meds and having no lunch finding what I want. They're under aid in the pip boy.
---
I always played Fallout with a fusion core mod that reduced by 90% how much PA, PA sprinting, and PA jetpack drained your FC, so I can't draw a comparison to 76. By all accounts in Fallout 4 jet packs drained FCs really fast too.
---
Even better have them be a star icon on the compass/map with the distance numbers. Basically like quest markers. So long as it's only on dead ones of course.
---
handmade is easy better. plus you can get legendary handmade but there are no legendary brotherhood recon rifles to be had. I've been running the same legendary handmade since level 53. I'm level 130 now and just two days ago upgraded to a new gun - another handmade.
---
This just happened to me, got me killed as I ran out of bullets and couldn’t switch weapons.
---
This happens from time to time on various servers. I’ve seen it at The Burrows but more often at Biv’s/Tattoo Parlor. Just change servers.
---
I just grab them all super quick, I'll stay downed so that I don't use any stimpacks but sheep squash is vulnerable 30 seconds and then some one picks me up so I can do it again.
---
I'm all for them being a camp item, but this is effectively an economy source, they shouldn't lock it to the season
---
Check all of your challenges including world.
---
Thanks for following up!
---
Why is Ra Ra?
---
We're still waiting for common sense to arrive in Appalachia.
---
Yep.  Every time I'm dancing with the cap limit I buy a card or two.  Have quite a few stockpiled for when I'm on a hot server.
---
If you have access to a private server, you can claim all three power plants and just sit a fusion generator next to the fusion core processor.  You don't have to power up the plant.  Each generates 3 every 22 minutes, so potentially you can farm almost 27 per hour.  Plus, you can put a stash box right in the workshops to offload the cores and not become overencumbered.
---
I guess you could conceivably do this on a public server, but there is always *that guy* who will show up to initiate PVP and ruin your fun.
---
If you are on PC and want to visit my private server one night and claim the processors, PM me.
---
*raises hand*
---
I use it as a battle drug, makes me punch the SBQ that much harder!
---
did you get the points at 3/5 completion? ive had that happen several times. i still completed the challenges, just in case. yeah, they still count.
---
I was ready to hate this idea, but the idea of appropriate and unavoidable downsides is intriguing.
---
It's a known issue with some doors in the Wasteland.  Just server hop (easier) or go back later (still may be shut).
---
I don't know if there's an added benefit to the freeze effect or not. Sounds like something Angryturtle would test out though.
---
Is that why I have so many of the damn things? Makes sense now. I don't even use power armor but I keep finding cores in my pockets.
---
If you manage to have a few hundred excess acid, there's about 70 iron nodes between Hornwright 03 and the unfinished mansion. 40ish more all over the west of Hornwright 03 if you really are hurting. Makes about 4k scrap with excavator &amp; super duper. Less xp and fun than weapon farming though. You can see all the spots on map76 under "LPI_VeinIron"
---
Awesome. Well done
---
Edit to add. Usually with those kinds of quests in this game, there will always be another way into an area that is behind level locks. They always make it possible to progress without them. The ability to pick a lock/hack a terminal is usually only the shorter way
---
I laughed a little too loud at that lol.
---
Yeah it's probably gone.  You could submit a support ticket to Bethesda, but I would not expect too much from that.
---
Hey man, I will by that from u fr fr lol
---
Ra ra
---
No
---
For people who struggle with ammo, make a secondary melee character, enjoy the freedom of never needing ammunition ever again, heck 90% of junk will only ever be used for camp building and sold for caps!
---
No way man,im sorry
---
Whoa. I hope so. My worst nightmare (in this game) would be to somehow scrap 20 months of building.
---
Unfortunately it is not possible. Support will probably not be able to help you there either.
---
Just out of curiosity, how can you "accidentally" delete your character? :)
---
Same.
---
F
---
I found a guy selling two for 500 caps each lol
---
Dude, I never take it out of my backpack.  It is the most underused weapon in the game.  A true gem.  I have mine in semi-auto because in auto I just kill all the birds and trees, but when I have all my bloodied magic going, I can sneak headshot at close to 4k.  Well I could before they broke Adrenaline LOL.
---
I'm excited for an influx of new players. planning some welcome packages to leave along the path to the wayward.
---
As the other person said you'll get 2000 by the end of the season in September... Which should be more than enough for any Halloween bundle that gets released.
---
No, it’s been a thing since launch when we only had 400lbs stashes.
---
Yeah I can’t attach screenshots to tickets. Jpgs, png’s they all say wrong format. I’ve tried this in both Chrome and Safari. Then I got to an existential crisis when I wanted to file a bug about the bug filing process but there was no appropriate categories in the Support / help site.
---
Team up bud. I have had a few people tag along hit a few and hide just to get the challenge done. I dont mind and when they let me know what they are looking for it makes it easier. 
---
Had a guy join me today for over an hour just wandering around i was doing most of the heavy lifting, but he always hit a few times for xp/challenge. Finally he wrote me to tell me what he really needed and i was able to port to the right place, kill what was needed, and that was that. He was no longer tied to my hip.
---
The stash boxes felt so much more stable during BETA for me.
---
If you want transfer stuff, add me , you can join my private server, transfer what you Need when im online, my ign Is infia

You ever heard of the gauss shotgun?....infuriates me to the core.
---
I don't think my fixer plan was up a day before it sold for 8k caps.  I've seen messages at camps asking to buy the plans for 10k.
---
How many orientals do you see in Appalachia?
---
I know! You cant even tell them what's wrong!
---
I'm on Xbox, so I can't help, but just wanted to suggest also posting on r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
I'm looking forward to "discounts" in new player vendors. Does that make me bad?
---
It makes even more sense in Workshops. I don't want to go into a whole thing about why so I'll just say there's potentially way more resources collectors at a workshops in most cases. Does it make sense anyone can just come up and take that stuff? It's okay to not like PvP, but how about you try looking outside your narrow perspective before calling something stupid.
---
Seconded. You can sneak through the reactor part at the end, you just need a decent weapon to take out the turrets and a few attentive robots (remember to target the fusion core on that sentry bot). You got this!
---
I had this happen, didnt help that as I dropped the vertibird the game crashed on me.
---
LVL 3 Lone Wanderer is absolutely pointless right now with Public Teams. The damage bonus and AP refresh gained pale in comparison to the XP gains of using Strange in Numbers with Carnivore or Herbivore and the appropriate INT-boosting and XP-boosting buffs.
---
As for Adrenaline, it's kind of a non-issue right now as it's bugged. so you really got to depend on other damage boost/DR-reduction perks.
---
I think I have enough SPECIAL and Junkies weapons to test going PA Full Health with 3x Heavy Gunner 3 and Stabilized 3. I'll even take off the accelerated barrel of my Junkies minigun to remove "magic damage " from the equation and see how drastic the difference is in terms of kills-per-second.
---
I've done every single daily and weekly except NW and I'm only 19 for the end of Week 1.
---
I'm so jealous right now.
---
After using the bow for a while I've started you get a feel for when a VATS shot will hit. If your target is moving horizontally expect to miss. If your target it standing still or charging directly at you expect a  hit. Ignore the % hit all together. After learning it I think this is intentional on Bethesdas part. Uve really got to treat it like a bow with a slow flying arrow. I'm curious if the compbow performs better but haven't been able to get a hold of a bloodied one for testing. Anyways keep your crossbow handy for when u need to be a VATS God and use the bow when uve got the drop on em.
---
we did get it right once.. throw a plasma grenade just as they're dropping in and you can get them all in one shot, I've never rolled through so fast and without wasting tons of ammo
---
good times
---
That's the fo76 community for you
---
I also have noticed some AP issues where I wouldn't have before.  I didn't put 2 and 2 together but now that you bring it up I suspect you may be onto something
---
Hell no, no offense. You'd definitely see people switching to something else, no one likes to wager their safety on rng.
---
Refund things in the shop and get the items back. Support will also let you keep what you refunded
---
Yep, got beat to shit today at white springs which doesn’t usually happen.
---
This. This is what I end up doing 90% of the time. After burning through my all of my stimpaks before the imposter has even mutated I just do this ad nauseam.
---
Damn. I was only level 43 but still sucks
---
Endurance has been simplified. For each level of END, you gain five HP, regardless of your level. After level 50, you can move SPECIAL stats around if you so desire, as you only get 49 points in total.
---
This is absolutely true.
---
Thanks very much - will do!
---
The secret is Cola Nut and Nuka Cherry.
---
I have had this occur a few times, usually right after loading into an area or making a lot of changes. I have never had it remain that way more than a couple minutes though.
---
And from the snallygaster at toxic larrys and the flooded train yard.
---
Not really  theres 10 drinks in there and only 1 shine, youve just as good a chance of getting tick blood tequila or ballistic boc
---
I feel like I get them 75% of the time from the scorch beast DNA one and from Line in the Sand (which people do lately with the Seasons thing).
---
And listen to the ghoul.. stay by the outer walls.  Don't venture into the middle of the radiation.
---
Plus there definately will be plenty of free stuff to earn, there was last year right? I don't even remember any Halloween Atom Shop items from last year
---
Unfortunately this new system is geared toward players buying atoms if they want things from the shop.
---
Then eventually Hitting a level 5 ghoul, seeing your damage points appear and the fkr still alive, let's take another shot oh wait now I have to reload because of the missed shots...grrr
---
I never died there until the patch. Now it is hit and miss whether I can make a full run without getting clobbered.
---
Not the ammo converter I can tell you that.
---
When doing the Wastelanders make sure you get the Chinese Stealth Suit early on.  It can be helpful and you won't have to wait forever to rank-up a faction in order to buy it (thus saving a lot of gold bullion).
---
Lots of players will have low Chsrisma and most of the common rank 1 perks are popular enough that they're already in the build you're using. Making it useless to share for a lot of players.
---
I'm guessing mine are from line in the sand. Ran that one a couple of times. Accidentally stumbled on the 1st tent trick last night trying to ready myself for the inevitable hoarding at the end. 
---
I have no use for them. I guess I can dump them in my shop for a handful of caps.
---
No one was even there for me no player icon and i had white text when i unlocked the thing, stupid mechanics all round be will never see eye to eye.
---
It doesn't matter i've quit Fo76 anyway far too many issues and terrible mechanics to enjoy, i'mma go back to Fo4.
---
Idk about other battle passes. But Warframe allows you to miss several weeks and dailies are basically nothing compared to weeklies and weeklies can be completed in one day easy
---
It’s funny how the stash system is based around weight when it’s the number of items that truly generates server performance issues.
---
But yeah as others have said # of items is the issue, especially items with other things tied to them like condition or effects
---
Gauss rifle is like that too for semi auto, if I stayed in stealth I could get over 4K dmg with adrenaline and gun fu.  But VATs got bad with wastelanders and I switched to commando in my main and now I’m addicted to the dmg 😭
---
Personally I use caps to buy plans, junk, and legendary gear for my other characters or sometimes the occasional really good rolls but not quite god tier. If I’m at max caps that means I need to be buying junk or other plans I don’t have and then I’ll sell a fixer plan for 10k and get it all back to repeat. People sell 3 star bloodied weapons for junk and it’s just very useful to have tons of junk in general for everything.
---
AND let the turrets/Assaultron duke it out for awhile and don’t even enter the fray until after the attrition. You can drop down and really not have to fight them if you’re sneaking properly but it’s always better to have less of them when you make that end run to the gold.
---
Public team system is very good
---
Fun fact: I've actually been kicked from public teams for not sharing a perk.
---
Bit rude.
---
Some body hooked me up and just left It was weapons , ammo and Stim packs
---
I really don’t get why this has constantly been suggested from the beginning of the game...I really don’t 🤷‍♂️ /s
---
I hate to admit but I just got carried through a match. I was just so excited to have really awesome people there, because I’m still just terrible at it! I tend to want to avoid other players still rather than running and gunning, which is the worst impulse for battle royale, but I want the rewards so I still try.
---
Well it wasn’t me my little brother was on my Xbox and that happened.
---
Xbox also. During some of the events, the stuttering is insane. Only seems to be in events for me though, where there is a lot going on. Scortched Queen in particular is a mess lol
---
Keep in mind, you get far less free atoms now
---
This is how Battle Passes work. 
---
You can’t expect 100 Legendary tier items in a battle pass. It has a ton of filler, and a few Legendaries sprinkled throughout. 
---
Atleast with 76 you can use caps/bullion/scrip even if you don’t want it. In other games those would be common/rare tier skins that are useless.
---
You have my respect, dad
---
Oh, I'm sorry :/
---
I sell them for 25 caps ( full only) and they always sell out immediately.  Many people sell them for more, I just want them to go to a good home.
---
Usually if I accidentally one-shot a legendary during Uranium Fever, I'll drop the legendary at the top of the stairs next to "Alpha". I honestly don't mean to do it.
---
There’s no way, that’s actually insane if someone sold those for that lol..
---
And people wonder why players dup3d legendary modules. At least now you have a low chance of getting one from the legendary vendor
---
Pretty much. Seems a waste to toss them when someone else can get some use out of them.
---
The gold, rep, notes are all doable.  It is the modules that are the evil roadblock.  It takes about 10-20 crafts usually to get a decent Gauss Shotgun.  For a God Roll, it might take double that.  Don't feel bad though, I burned nearly 400 modules getting a full set of mixed 2 and 3 star unyielding SS armor. Stung for a few weeks.
---
You’re a great father, that’s the only thing I can say!
---
as of now its only available by people who abused an exploit, highest unverified legit i saw was 42, highest verified i saw was 2 days ago at 30
---
Yeah I got over it already but I did have a pretty good gun and solid build lol
---
Welcome to the club, I’ve used ALOT of legendary modules trying for a bloodied gauss minigun, unyielding secret service armor and bloodied gauss shotgun, I finally got all of them, it takes time, instead of using them as soon as I got them I would spread it out over multiple worlds, different times and locations.
---
all you can do is use the best you have for now.
---
I got really lucky and got a junkies in the first 10. But since then no luck trying to get a bloodied out of about 40 modules
---
Can’t wait until it’s on VR.
---
Rip dude that’s actually kinda tragic
---
There are people cheating and activating godmode to boost to the end
---
Being right doesn't make the item worth a damn suddenly. The point of the original comment was that the sink was next to worthless.
---
Talking about how pipes work dies not refute that in any way
---
Awesome quantum guitar
---
Now you should play some uranium rock
---
Thanks!
---
If it reset back to 1000 score for each portion I’d be satisfied. 
---
I’m at 21 and it’s already 1500score per level. If it doesn’t cap out or reset at some point, it’s going to feel real fucking shitty tryin to grind out 3000+ score per level.
---
Cranberries, brain fungus, starlight berries, firecracker, carrot flower, the big orange mushroom I cant remember the name of ...
---
Agreed.  For some reason, it seems that VATS works nearly perfectly for my Semi-Auto Railway Rifle.  VATS sucks for all of my other weapons, missing the first shot without fail. That is part of why it has become my go-to semi for now.
---
^^
---
Forgot to include this, thanks - I’ve made a edit with this and the scrapper perk
---
Absolutely and any low energy ones I just leave in train station suitcases.
---
You CAN see what perks your teammates are running. Just open your perks screen and look for the funky sorta-infinity symbol on the upper right corner of those cards.
---
In FO76, 95 percent shots miss often miss several time in a row because of bugs.  In X-Com, they miss because a lot of people don't grasp that in a game where you take 100 shots in a round you're going to miss five 95 percent shots on average.
---
Also in X-Com 2, in every difficulty but Legendary the game cheats slightly in your favor despite what the stats say.  As you play more and move up in difficulty the stats become more true to what they say on screen you actually do miss more shots.
---
Lamo yeah I was playing a game with my 6 yr old sisters kid and it was nuts to watch him pick whatever looked cool instead of min maxing 😂
---
Cumulative. I'm not actually sure a match can run to a half hour, I think the circle closes before then.
---
It's frustrating, I finished the questline and started up my first one with the free one you get... and never again! I see now why I rarely see the notification pop up unless I specifically join somebody from the official Xbox club's page!
---
Despite their being a ton of high level players and nothing going on? Hardly anyone showed up and the event failed cause only me and one other guy were getting the pylons cause 'mUh LeGeNdArY lOoT!'
---
I was so pissed off and thought 'Well I sure as shit ain't hosting this ever again' I'm newer, I got serum plans and stuff to invest in. This cap sink isn't worth my time unless I join a server where people are actually farming it
---
cumulative
---
 although i do not have an answer for if it adds on seconds or just tracks  full minutes (like 1 min 30 seconds, does the 30 seconds vanish or is it added on to your "next rounds" time)
---
I am thoroughly digging it. Not too much luck getting real stuff done like arctos and the old boys (did they nerf drops or something?) but yeah I get to play with new people and it is nice?
---
This happens to me with my handmade with faster fire rate. The work around is after it misses the second "95%" shot just let off the trigger for a second and then fire again. That normally fixes it.
---
If this is accurate I'm two levels behind even after doing the weeklies on the first day and completing every set of dailies.
---
Its harder for sure, it came out after sbq, ER HELPS but even full ER gear will just get you naked for the gutsy spam, dead one way or another, you basically need to just chug stimpaks from full health, if youre bloodied heal up to full and youll be back to low hp easily. Wear PA  if you arent fully familiar (also for the fast stim speed) but if no PA you should probably be stealth. Grounded mutation and glowing fungus puree at least give you a chance to mash F before empty. Then theres the matter of killing her... Magic weapons, its nerf or nothin.
---
So i have been debating that. I stopped playing when I made a viable bloodied build and the stats don’t match up to the legendaries I have for that old build. I’m honestly surprised I can still kill things with it let alone it being actually serviceable.
---
It's not that there's an expectation that everyone should be able to finish it, it's that, at least from my experiences, most other battlepass-style systems aren't anywhere near as tight with how much progress you can make with challenges. Alongside that, most of them have some subset of challenges, usually the weeklies, that stick around permanently even when the next week rolls around.
---
EDIT: Oh, and I also forgot that most other battlepasses I've seen don't increase level requirements as you go.
---
apparently the plans spawn near Landview Lighthouse.
---
25 is the lowest lever action so you couldn't even use one if you got the plans now. 
---
You can buy them as soon as you're 25 so.. go get that XP
---
It took my 3 weeks of 2 gauss shotguns per day to get a bloodied faster fire rate vats filler before that it was all stalkers zealots and hunters
---
Thank you, i need to get me one of those.
---
It works on my railway and handmade, but sucks on my fixer.  Now I’m down to carrying the handmade, railway, plasma for the queen, and a pipe rifle now that public events are more popular.
---
Pretty much shit means some might not be. And if one of the good ones is at rank 90+ (like almost all unique cosmetics to the season and the fireplace that door numerous people have stated is their only goal) then the only way to get those is through absurd grind
---
Yeah I was happier when I didn't know. I've just always sold those extra "known" ultracite  plans for 49c, across the board. I did manage to get another one so I've got that at least. I have no idea how many top tier weapons\armour\outfits\plans I sold at blowout prices during my first few months of vending. I have found some really good deals at player vendors as well so it's all good
---
That's a good tactic too, my issue is I can never get 'downed', i always end up straight up dead having to respawn lol
---
Still a better love story than the water well.
---
 The only issue I have is the log in everyday part. There are some hardcore players that for whatever rl reasons can't do that and I think they got hosed a little. Other than that though I really don't have a problem with it.
---
I have no idea how the event works but I jumped in as a level 49 and shot robots, died four times and luckily got some shots in on the imposter thing as I watched my 3fps slideshow. 
---
(XBox One S)
---
They give you far less per time investment than the system they removed for it
---
Maybe I’ll check it out server hop a couple times in case it’s RNG and say after 10-15 hops I’ll know if it’s level based all around or just for the vendors.
---
Yeah, real disappointed. It doesn’t help at all with the 4600 .38 ammo that I collected passively. It is a nice sentiment but it needs scaleable values.
---
That is was +25, as the next level is 25 more xp than last
---
I mean, they're releasing content soon for the BOS, then fully releasing the BOS and a bunch of stuff with the Winter update. The fall update is giving us a rebalanced world and level scaling which is taking up their time and resources I bet. The Steel Dawn questline in the Fall as well. 
---
So yea, they gav eus this battle pass as something to hold us over for the time being. It's pretty fine to be honest, ply a alittle bit of easy ass objectives, get free rewards. I just wish they'd make more damn skins for other guns or more hair styles
---
Yeah I definitely feel that, I once sold a traveling leather coat I got as a drop for 100 caps.. I’ll never forget it. 🤦‍♂️
---
Are you spamming stimpacks while you die, if you press that button while down, it will kill you.
---
Sounds like you failed economics in high school
---
Please post more Bird's Eye views of the rest of the map!
---
I'd be happy with instigating at least and explosive. If I got a bloodied or Junkies I'd probably trade it since I'm not a big fan of the build, I'm too casual for it.
---
I’m down. I sell everything for 1 cap in the forest anyway.
---
That’s why I have a friend fight them while we launch artillery at their camps just to get back at them or we launch a nuke and don’t help fix their camp
---
Lol I'm still having a hard time believing there's this many clown posts complaining about it when the first week isn't even over. A few words come to mind when we are less than 10% through and people are already whining about not getting all the rewards
---
You’re looking for aluminum? Just gather ski poles outside Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and Top of the World.
---
Great, the more, the merrier!
---
what I think the event needs is for the pylon carriers to gain a tesla coil style area of effect damage that scales with the number of pylons you are carrying, so if you have all three you deal massive damage across a huge enough radius that you can just sit in the shack and deal damage to effectively all the enemies that spawn, racking up exp and the ability to loot all the enemies after the event ends, as well as being guaranteed to get damage on the boss.
---
As it is being the carrier is nothing but misery, you take a ton of damage, use a ton of supplies, die super often and easy, and can't really deal damage to everything as you have to struggle just to not die from the pylon. And you don't get any exp or loot for being the pylon guy.
---
Meanwhile, jack mcgee on the roof of the shack blowing up every robot that spawns, and then ending the imposter in 3.2 nano seconds of becoming visible gets all the loot, all the exp, and gives not one hoot if the event succeeds because he can farm the robots freely for the whole duration and get more exp and loot than anyone who is trying to actually finish the event.
---
The event sucks and is badly designed because it actively punishes you for doing the event, and rewards people who don't contribute and are only there to farm for themselves.
---
Man, I had the opposite luck.  Crafted a B33FMS and an Instigating 50%LD in the first 10 rolls.  Then took almost 400 to get Unyielding SS.  I bet I crafted 150 left legs alone.  Worst luck ever.  I had modules left from the Strangler Heart Grind from the vault, or I still wouldn't have a full set.
---
ah ok I was wondering why lifegiver took so many slots, thanks so much
---
You sure don't forget them 😂
---
honestly do what i did, once the next patch drops and the game is more stable.  (on ps4 it barely runs for me longer than 20 mins without a crash)
---
what did i do?  i subscribed to first for two months.  made a ncr outfit and helmet.  put a scrapbox in a place i wouldn't ever want to move it, and farm the hell out of junk.
---
you'll get to keep the armor, just not make any new copies, and you can take the junk out, but not add more into the scrapbox.  so i'm gonna be unsuscribed until my scrapbox is empty.
---
Trying to get some confirmation but I keep getting opposing answers. Is the ghillie suit available now? I've got it for all my bush wookie sessions but the wife does not. It would be nice to get for her.
---
I don’t know if there’s any way to share it with other players?
---
Or if you’re on Xbox
---
Yeah. Getting it early is easy and no-cost via a simple quest. I’m a bloodied build and use it to sneak all over including silos. That 3.5 sneak bonus plus a good bloodied gauss rifle and stuff goes splat. 
---
If you don’t do the suit quest then the suit will cost a lot of gold later on.
---
The...season pass. I call it a battle pass because it's essentially the same exactly system as other games.
---
Hit recognition in this game is total ass.
---
You know that part near the middle where there is some buildings?  When you get there head pretty much south, and follow the tunnels down there.
---
Weird
---
Thank you
---
You find some way to make it benefit you and they'll fix it the next day
---
nah. I have my degree on it and yet they don't own you nothin beside what already in the game, and to the other guy there I'm lazy and do t wanna do another reply, before the legendary run I didnt do dailies after I brought the robot, not worth it farm atoms just for the sake of it, the entire atom shop is ugly anyway, the only thing I wanna is the fridge the one to store meat and I just need more 10 atoms so all good.
---
but definitely I would trade this half-ass update for an payed new dlc(with new map and quests like eso)
---
Protip: have less stuff on you. The total item weight especially when affected by perk cards matter but each individual item is a calc the game has to run, throw away trash ammo or dont pick it up, dump junk frequently, and just dont use bandolier or pack rat, too many calculations to run, i tried this and got pleasantly surprised. Yes stimpaks and water too. Everyone and their mother has to run thru hiker and traveling pharmacy .
---
True. It’s just that I want to make sure I have them but reading around the plans spawn pretty frequently at the vendors at 25.
---
Gee, I wonder why they're afraid of giving us anything new
---
If you're not prepared to take all 3 pylons and spam stimpacks on the roof, don't start the event solo.
---
Yes, that means you need fallback builds that aren't bloodied no matter how much you love bloodied, but it's not your fault. Bethesda fucked up by charging caps to start a "raid" requiring actual mechanics to win. It's not like launching a nuke to summon the SBQ and then wasting all your ammo for 20 minutes by yourself, since you got plenty of XP and rewards out of launching the nuke in the first place. You didn't just walk into any train station in Appalachia and spend 1000 caps on a ticket to the possible shitshow.
---
Bullion is the new scrip, you could have a server full of level 400s and not have a single one show up to Encryptid because it's so much of a hassle compared to any other event that might pop up after investing time and resources in seeing if enough people were gonna show up to Encryptid. No one gives a damn about guaranteed legendaries anymore.
---
He was trying to get put into godmode. This technique was patched tho
---
I'm spamming stims in an attempt not to die, there may be a button press just as my last HP depletes, but once i reach that point I'm not spamming the button any further.  Though it could be that last press as i die lol
---
I wish we could trade them. I saved up 25k since the game came out. Just never bought anything. I’d love to give them away.
---
Very XP
---
Ooooh now I know. Thank you! :)
---
Yeaaa but this is also a different strain of FEV Appalachia is dealing with 
---
I mean there already are biological differences between the Super Mutants in the Mojave, Commonwealth, and heck the FEV in DC makes them yellow lol
---
I don't see the problem with this particular strain not fully eliminating some traces of original gender, as it is much less  developed than the one The Master created after years of trying to create the concoction for perfect Unity
---
Yeah but with excavator its gotta be more right? After finding it I have 72 ore
---
But there is no pass?
---
Nice just found it, I was looking for like a straight down shaft lol thanks!
---
Love your child's mindset! He finna grow up as a good kid
---
Again, cosmetics are not a necessity.  You don’t need them.
---
Most retailers sell this game for a fraction on that price these days.  I paid for the Tricentennial edition and have a Fallout 1st subscription and I’m not complaining.
---
I’m sitting on over 11k Atoms because most things don’t appeal to me.  If you want to get everything the Atomic Shop has to offer that’s a you problem.  Quit expecting free handouts like you’re owed it.  You can still earn your free Atoms so quit complaining.
---
Lots of things will boggle your mind if you just refuse to listen to other opinions and say "blah blah entitled" while comparing a casual coop mulitplayer game to mmo's with fully fleshed out content and endgames.
---
Have you found the reason? I have exact same issue.
---
The problem is we used to get atoms for less effort and we could do what we wanted with them. 
---
Now if you want something you have to hit that rank. No other way.
---
The grind isn't about closing the distance faster, it's the only way to complete it if you so much as miss a couple days.
---
Dataminers have you d that the other repeatable is for completing event quests. Many of which take5-10 minutes. Roughly 100-200 minutes per day of S.C.O.R.E you miss
---
Not all high level players do this. I’m 458, and don’t do this crap. One, it’s not ‘fair’. Two, what’s the point? So you can say ‘I beat scorched earth in 30 seconds’? Obviously these guys are bored and have nothing better to do. Or two, they’re bored AND cheap. Because they could easily do this on a private server. But responding to this, probably just adds fuel to the fire. These players love this sh*t. Disrupting other players just trying to play the game .
---
I'm on ps4 and the same thing happened to me anyone know how to fix this
---
This is most likely the case. Can't guarantee anything with the spaghetti mess of a code this game has going, but there's no reason for there to be constant timer checks going on in the background when you're out in the wasteland. Far more likely there is a timestamp and it simply runs a check every time you access a vendor/gold machine/etc
---
You forget, this isn't a new mechanic. It is a replacement. And what it replaced was easier to complete and offered more rewards.
---
Interesting. The curve table is unchanged, so there must be something else at work. Thanks for your notes.
---
I had more misses than hits with vats in queens fight. End up used my own instinct, i get 80% hit rates
---
don't forget teckpic costs only 1 dolar per day.
---
hahahaha joking a side, nice mate, keep with the good work
---
They aren't free unless you just got the game because it is a steep forced opportunity cost.
---
The obv method was patched its still out there unfortunately :( it really needs to be patched fully not band aided...
---
I could take them myself to a vendor and sell for at least 300, but that's not helping other players.  Majority of people buying my serums have been lower levels looking to use them.  I don't actually stock them in my vendors, I have a sign to DM for serums, and i make them on request. This way daddy big bucks can't prematurely buy out my stock to sell at a profit lol
---
That’s a natural POV... for a racist
---
There is a YouTube video showing it still works.

Hop into Nuclear Winter. I've won a TON of the Halloween and Christmas stuff in the last week there
---
the first time I participated in the event I was so lost and almost dying all the time that was the worst event I ever did, never touched that again, can you elaborate what is pylons?(I was lvl 42 btw)
---
Just yesterday I found him in bed again, then when I spoke to him he got up on the wrong side, slid backwards into the middle of the bed, went back to the edge, then backpedaled to the proper side of the bed. I think I saved the video clip but am done for tonight. Ill check tomorrow and try to clip it and send it here.
---
Hmm yeah not sure. I don’t think it did, but I’ll keep an eye on it going forward. Thanks for the input!

Feel free to add me as well, witty_nickname. Happy to share my private world!

To be honest I think they will be giving us more rewards then other games....since they don’t have a secondary “money pass” where you get more things because you pay... Yes they will be opening up the option to buy spaces... and in all honesty I will be buying some of them...but its the same items that everyone else can choose to buy...or play and earn. And we are assuming that each level will exponentially grown in score points needed. Has any one gotten to “chapter 2” yet, maybe it resets and goes back done to the beginning like chapter one. Until someone is able to get all the way to 100 and show how it works then we can choose to complain about it. I have a 10 day camping trip starting this Friday. I will admit now, I will be buying however many spots I need to get to 100. If no one else has posted their findings by doing the same thing, I will make a fully detailed post , and then we can all go from there.
---
currently the bugs for score i have personally experienced on ps4&gt;  
---
100% weekly challenges that are "out of /5" that have multiple conditions that need met, like kill x amount of different types of robots... will give score at marker "3/5" and will give nothing at marker "5/5"  sample size = 2
---
100% challenges that have only one condition that needs met, but are "out of /5" have given me zero score at any point.  example the do 5 events one.  sample size = 1
---
about 50% of the daily challenges have not given me score.  i didn't think of writing down how many i've done total, but six daily challenges have given me no score.  this was on previous days during the weekly cycle that is ending tonight.
---
today all the daily challenges (four) functioned as intended and gave me score upon completion.
---
I would say level up. Or get someone to carry you through Bots On Parades
---
Sorry guys ): I didn't know . I just gave him a lecture telling him it's not cool :} someone gave me a hard time just now cause I innocently and ignorantly tried to help him.
---
It's coming to GamePass on PC too so I'll be ready to get rid of my 300 stimpaks and Radaways. I'll also build low-level Fixers/BOS rifles and drop them everywhere.
---
Ok thanks I’ll try that
---
Nah, I'm on PC.
---
Legendary enemy kills of any kind will give you commendations. Also, any enclave events will give you commendations.
---
I didnt get the Build a C.A.M.P reward, although it was around the refresh time.  Just tonight I completed the weekly to kill robots, and got no reward or notification.  It shows as completed though.
---
Oh also do Leader of The Pack for 3 legendaries.
---
I always try and drop something at a persons camp who allows me to use it.  Usually I put a present on their bed. Lol
---
I have a Quad and it freezes her every time, Sheepsquatch too :)
---
Says the user who doesnt "dgaf using the n word" according to your previous posts. Cue eyeroll.
---
Nice! Let's hope we can make the game a welcome place for all the new players!
---
I like taking every pylon so i know exactly when she becomes vulnerable and can get my damage in, knowing i’m covered if i die. I use to die every time i went to this event but the last few times i’ve been surviving. People do so much damage that even with all 3 pylons, she doesn’t last long enough for it to matter so long as you keep spamming those stims haha
---
It seems like a good idea on paper. The end-game for this is essentially a looter shooter grind, so it would make sense to follow up those mechanics. I think the only issue would be the fact that you have a limited carry capacity (and, indirectly via server lag, an inventory limit). It would work well if you could designate what to take, such as "only pick up ammo, stims, and anything with screws in it". I just don't feel like that would ever work properly. They'd also have to fix the memory issues causing corpses, mainly legendaries, to disappear instantly too
---
It tracks full minutes only.
---
Having recently started a new character, witnessing how lightning quick i can move around stash, and how quickly items can be crafted, I'd say this is most likely the case lol
---
And?
---
Are you not paying attention? We're talking about people who wipe her out within 5 seconds of her flying above drop site 9. Come on, dude. You're missing the point.
---
Just hit 34 the burn out is real lol but I’ll keep going since I made it this far
---
I’ve had both a TSE and Double Explosive cryo, and I couldn’t tell much difference. Though I did eventually start just using the double since the condition would go down a lot slower and having twice the cell charge is just nice for spamming the Queen.
---
I do this too, to farm steel. Any event where the enemies come in waves is super helpful. Like the collision course event at the Morgantown airport. The scorch are weak so you don't have to waste ammo on them. Just a good hit with a golf club or a punch to the face.
---
I think I played with you once, i was level 12 or something I don’t remember.
---
Guess I'll be farming for a Legendary Handmade it seems. :)
---
These are the kind of posts I want to see. A little bit of faith in humanity, restored.
---
Aint nothing wrong with trying to find out why yo! Yea some ppl are mad against it and I get why I just generally avoid it. It seems like a trap since they could just check who has lvl100 before next patch and boom ban hammer their dumb +$$ (ppl are abusing god mode currently to get rank 100 in the first season😭 someone did it within the first 24hrs of it being released). It'd be near impossible to get rank 100 legit before Augest 4th Imo.
---
Get the Aquaboy card, queue solo, hide in Grafton Lake, periodically check the game to see if you're dead yet while doing literally anything else.  
---
Once you're dead, do it again until you've clocked the 30.
---
Do the event "Leader of the pack"  Three guaranteed legendaries, scaled to your level.   You might even get something good that you can use.
---
I’ll try it thanks
---
I felt like she was mostly inspired by Sally from Mothership Zeta, right down to crawling through vents and opening doors if you're nice.
---
If your on ps4 I got one maybe we can make a deal
---
You have an alternative in the repeatable.  Just do the XP repeatable 2-3 times instead.
---
Or, to top onto Tenebrate's suggestion, learn the art of bush wookie. Hide in the bushes wearing environment suiting clothes. The only armor I use is Wood to help blend in.
---
Will send a request - thanks!
---
I just wanted unyielding SS armor and it took over 50 modules to just to get a chest and an arm piece. I am not even particular about the minor effects. I imagine I will spend over 100 modules just to get the rest at this rate.
---
P.S. Chemist Perk doubles how much Lead you get from ore.
---
Same thing happens with blueprints containing vending machines. Really sucks if you move camp and are trying to place blueprints 😔
---
If it is worth the cost to save the effort, scrap the stored turrets individually and then you can place the blueprint - but you will have to pay the materials to rebuild them.
---
Just another bug.
---
I noticed that its broke in NW as well.
---
Haha thanks! And yes for now it seems like it's impossible. I'm just trying to have fun with what we have :)  but that's just me. And oh yea! Cheating is just no fun. Not right, but not fun too XP
---
You have an alternative- xp
---
That’s additional, not an alternative.
---
When you use a recall card at the terminal you activate the event. The imposter sheepsquatch is invisible and invulnerable at first. There are three pylons in the area and players go up to one to active them. Once activated their health will drain but when all three are activated the imposter sheepsquatch will be visible and vulnerable and that's ehrn you can kill it.
---
Ah man that’s a shame
---
where do you get the card?
---
It would be cool if the bigger ring did exist though. Maybe have it be a radstorm that lasts as long as the nuke or something.
---
How am I smelling Sheepsquatch stank and only getting a 73% in VATS?
---
You can do it as many times as you want so it can be an alternative if you make it one.  Take the time you took to do the nw challenge and just grind xp instead.  Problem solved.
---
I think rather than just getting angry about the problem we should be advocating for the solution.  
---
Very simply: extend the timeframe by 2-3 weeks for this season and/or reduce the Score required for each rank.
---
It is still available at this time. You need to get 14,650 Overseer Rank to unlock it.
---
My buddy needed a new camp location so as a group we voted that he take a nukashine and let the liquor decide where to build. He now lives in ash heap shot hole lmao
---
You get a free card doing the quests but then after that typically all robot vendors will have an assaultron recall card for sale. After buying it you can craft the one you use in your tinkers
---
Who can grind 30,000 XP in 30 minutes?
---
[the proper way to use the wallpaper ](https://ibb.co/vBt70LD)
---
What about those that whisper to themselves with their mics on? I was getting weirded out by this kid doing it earlier. Then he started laughing. I jumped servers after that.
---
People are just general d*ckheads whilst playing encryptid, atleast so ive noticed. Everytime i start every1 is just jumping around or standing on the roof and than im left to turn on the pylons. It really sucks
---
I’m with you! It’s worth the grind to me since I missed it first time around (took a long break from the game). I feel like outfit collecting is the real end game haha. Best of luck to you!
---
oooh I had a pile of those, I droped all on the Charleston station
---
thanks  for the clarification
---
Is it only taking you 30 minutes to complete your NW daily?  With time waiting in lobby and everything?  Wow you must be really good at NW.  Not sure what the issue is then.
---
Woah there a second, don't be flinging that tar brush around
---
If you have First, the veteran ranger gear also blends in really well with bushes. Not quite like the official bush Wookiee suit, but it’s close enough. The duster is just the right shade of brown.
---
The challenge is survive 30 minutes?????
---
I agree, it's not for me either.
---
Shooting an explosive weapon effect at anything to close can one shot myself.
---
They aren't given so you may be confused with circuit board. Only. 1 is given in the quest and after that you have to buy them for around 2k caps depending on charisma
---
Actually I'm pretty open to it, like I said about learning something new. I don't need you to explain how English works, or the value of keeping an open mind. My "learned" ass rolls with the punches, is wrong often, and learns from it.
---
I still think it's as dumb as the over and misuse of ironic or literally, but sure, I already admitted to googling it and finding both uses common.
---
Just curious, how did you get that far in the main story at level 11?
---
That’s where mine is too, now I’m nervous!
---
You'll want demo expert to buff the damage as well. Also the handmade was designed for commando, not rifleman so you'll get more out of it switching your build over. The real damage from all rifles in this game comes from your stealth multipliers.
---
Obvious question but do you have low health?
---
If so do you have level 3 nerd rage equipped?
---
You also need to get the adrenal reaction mutation again.
---
Sorry mate, I rolled 4, and the 4th was a junkies +33% +1 agi
---
By skipping one day you’re actually 5 behind
---
But really just grind that mighty 10k xp you should be okay
---
The funny thing is that it was 10 positive by the time I went to sleep.
---
Be like me, jump jet up to her and sledge hammer her ass back to the ground
---
Pls stop downvoting my responses instsntly like a child so i can stop doing the same to you.  
---
The challenge is survive 30 minutes.  One match doesn't even last 30 minutes so you need to do 2 at the bare minimum.  With lobby times and loadscreens and the potential early death, causing you to have to queue up for a 3rd or 4th match, then it'll probably be more than 30 minuted if things go perfectly.  Also if you server hopped west tek i guarantee you could get 30000 xp in 30 minutes anyways.  Best of luck!
---
possibly, I don't remember the name but was a board lol, anyway thanks again :)
---
I had played before took a brake started a new character spent an hour going to white spring bunker and then to the waste dump avoided the death claws got in the bunker found the keycard and did the rest by basically avoiding every enemy
---
You have no idea what I'm talking about when the subreddit gets filled with people experiencing the issue every time the daily reset rolls around?
---
this is why my friends' kids are not allowed to touch my consoles until i have them logged into their own account, and they are forbidden from swapping controllers unless i'm around to make sure they go back into the right account.
---
swapping controllers without me being there or firing it up on their own is instant loss of console time for no less than a week.
---
i'd be a lair if i didn't say my fave kids out of the bunch are the ones who'd rather play retro emulated games on my ouya vs modern games on my modern consoles.
---
so much less stress when game saves and game data isn't even slightly adjacent to munchkins.
---
I have a lot of ammo supply’s
---
Thats Vault-Tec, baby!
---
No worries at all
---
You still do the same things you did before, nothing really changed. Except now you optimize your build for EXP boost.
---
Yeah nerd rage is active level three I think you're right on the adrenal reaction I remember when I first started out I had way more power when I just had the basic couple mutations
---
Base mine is 450... demo expert, bloodied mess, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, then for some extra yummy dmg use adrenaline stacks. I’ve seen my hm go up to 700 base with that card stacking
---
Edit: I used mine on a rifle man character for a year before I realized it’s sort of a waste of 5.56 and should just run it on a commando. For rifle man the BE lever action is king imo. But it’s a pretty decent sniper for rifleman though the fire rate is great.
---
&gt;Pls stop downvoting my responses instantly like a child so i can stop doing the same to you
---
The pot just called the kettle black y’all.
---
Excellent, my favorite weapon and favorite power armor. Great job!
---
This is how I die 99.9% of the time with a bloodied build and explosive rifle.
---
God, I got so much dysentery by grabbing junk off overseer's kitchen and accidently clickin on that damn sink. Dysentery every single time.
---
The game has a serious lack of content so when they add stuff aim for causal players like season and ammo converter the entitled Hardcore players start complaining..
---
If the game had more hardcore stuff like daily dungeons or even raids they couldn’t complain about the causal stuff
---
That makes sense I'm currently trying to build my commando perks up but like Rifleman because I also use a be sniper but not often enough to justify 9 perk points gone for Rifleman I just switched it from Prime automatic receiver today too lol
---
Personally, I use the Tactical Suit with the chocolate chip pattern on it. Wood armor plus that brown tactical suit are very good for hiding. I can't say what is a good camo for the head though. But convenience works for me in this case, I have light brown hair, a beard and I use grime and dirt to add aesthetic to my PC, so those help me blend in too.
---
I love your edit.  People didn't agree with me and had viable solutions so you people suck.  Lol go get them tiger!
---
That's my end game as well, i have to say there are some really impressive rewards in NW as well. Event and just ranking up, nice camp items weapon skins etc. 
---
Good luck on it, I think I'm another 1k away.
---
I realize that this comment may get hate but im not even worried about completing it. I enjoy the game and just from doing the dailies and weeklies from this week +the 10k xp bonuses i am at score rank 21. 
---
It takes me maybe an hour to complete the standard 6 dailies, and an hour or two more depending on the nw challenge. During that time i normally make another 3-400 score from xp. 
---
I realize i am an outlier in that i actually enjoy the gameplay, but this isnt hard at all. Combine that with having ~3500 atoms from fo1st by the end, i wont mind "paying" my way to 100 if i really cant finish it naturally.
---
I’m with ya, and you are doing better than me by even trying it. One day I will actually go in.  Lol
---
I called out people’s tone, not their ideas.
---
I think I have a problem here LOL I need 450 damage too!
---
Encrypted is one event that I can actually do alright at, sort of. I use all weapon weight reducing armour, but I have a full set of troubleshooters armour too. I switch into that, but I'm so over encumbered that I can barely move. BUT, if all the stars align, I become a conduit and just lay into the sheepsquatch with my vampires Gatling laser while it solely aims at me. I don't lose any health the whole time it attacks (as long as it stays right in my face).
---
I don't specialise in anything, so it's the only time in the game that I feel like an absolute overpowered god!
---
I forgot to mention that’s semi auto dmg I think with the commando it’s like 300 ish
---
Is that 5 days or 5 levels?
---
I used up my stimpak stash on this event just once so I try to avoid taking the pylons until I have 50 again (starting to regret selling stimpaks to venders right about now).
---
I held onto my card for seemingly forever and then decided to finally do it at level 60. I wanted to be careful and let time pass before I started to ensure we had enough people in attendance to make it work. Of course a high level player in power armor comes and starts it for me. I gave him the angry/ thumbs down emote, but luckily we had enough people there. I take the pylons against my better instincts though very often just to help.
---
Yours automatic?
---
Another junkie bites the dust.   Lol 😉
---
When I am starving or dehydrated I get like 5 FPS
---
Thanks for the downvote.  It's crazy you can call out people's tone thru written word.  Your super duper smart.
---
They do the worst possible job for keeping players active. Limiting every possible resource acquisition in an online game makes player quit cause it's boring, annoying and tiring, also promotes burnout quick.   
---
They should have balanced ways to let players to keep farming for whatever they want to go for (bullion, scrips, etc.) so players if they wanna play 10 hours in a single day they are not punished without getting anything after they do their dailies.  
---
Same with S.C.O.R.E, yeah the EXP repeatable is welcoming but it doesn't feel very significant unless you farm like a maniac, instead they can let us get SCORE through events or other means.
---
'Clean sink' doesn't mean 'Clean water source' lol
---
But i agree with the original point still lol
---
Maybe check your grammar before insulting other people’s intelligence, kind of undermines your argument. See that? I just used “your” correctly ;)
---
Wait until the next event with challenges, duplicate cards from those packs will give you xp and makes it that much easier to unlock things. Unless you missed the xmas and halloween challenges or any of the previous challenges with the ghillie suit, because you can unlock them right now.
---
You didn't read the post very well.  The link was not for the heavy weapon build.
---
Quick question(s). You're aware that you cannot reach level 100 without doing the repeatable hundreds of times, right? You're aware that the system is set up where doing every single daily/weekly for every single day/week of the system still won't give you enough points to reach level 100?
---
So when people who do have lives dedicate themselves to still logging on every single day to jump through your elitist hoops and still end up short of 100 at the end of the season, will you still look at them and say "you just want everything for free with no work"?
---
The prime receiver isn't worth anyway IMO. Once you get your commando perks put a Hardend automatic receiver on it.... You will not regret it.
---
Tbh its like 2000 season pass points so a level and some change early on
---
It will slow down soon don't worry. Early levels are a breeze later you will need 3 days worth of dailies to get one level.  
---
Also don't want to ruin it for you but [you are already behind if you want to get to 100.](https://imgur.com/wH4Uv2q)
---
This is why I don’t drop Nuke Mines. Duh...
---
Not at all to be honest. Not being aware of the gigantic dangers the post-WW3 wasteland poses and playing it all off like a silly game will either get her killed or whoever she is with killed very soon. Someone needs to kick some sense into that kid before a total disaster happens.
---
Gail is NOT a civilized or pacified mutant like you know from the past Fallout games. She is still clearly dumb as hell and rage-fueled, and its only a matter of time till she goes on a rampage due to some minor mishap either with her or Ra-ra. Better take her out back and neutralize with a shot to the head BEFORE it happens.
---
Just thinking tactically and realistically. Raiders clearly have 0 sense and self-preservation tactics.
---
I have a bug that rewards me for events I didn't participate in. It's been happening since the update. I've been waiting for that to patch as it's clearly not right.
---
Thanks, so now I'll have lots of competition for Hemlock Holes workshop lol. I play any mining events, like "Breach and Clear" and "Lode Baring", with the Excavator PA. During these events, all I do is mine. I get enough Lead and Iron ores in these 2 events so rarely ever go to Lucky Hole.
---
It's only three matches if you can successfully hide in a bush. Aim for the map center, but not exactly center, and it's doable because it's likely not much moving to new locations when the area shifts. I did it in three matches today. This is actually one of the easiest NW challenges.
---
Actually they still hurt the owner.
---
O your good. Such a great burn you went and dropped the mic and deleted you post.  Nighty night.
---
You're insufferable, dude.
---
You can make them in the tinkers work bench
---
Yeah while I sit and wait I've been doing that, I've unlocked two things today
---
I've also gone from rank 1 to 5
---
Rewarding for XP yes, but for time vs enjoyment I can't agree. It gets far too tedious
---
I drop excavator sets at lower level players camps once a week or so.
---
Not for the “endgame”
---
So that would explain why one player vendor had 600 plans but they were mostly the same thing.
---
Ahh I was .5 seconds too early asking lol I'm running semi auto too , Demo 5, nerd rage 3, all rifleman perks and tank killer  but only marsupial gonna whip up a adrenal now and see how that helps 255 dmg now just ate a eternal and now at 383 Much better !! Ty so much fellas you guys rule!
---
Yea but his point is that if you don't survive very long in the average game the overall time you invest in finding  new game after new game and going through the loading screens and time in the lobby is going to be more than just 30 minutes
---
Usually the lobby alone is about 3 minutes, so if it takes you about 4 games to reach 30 minutes of survival time, that means the time spent in the lobby plus in the game mode would put you at 42 minutes, and that's not including the loading screens
---
That time may be better spent doing stuff in the main game for a player such as you, especially if you use xp boosting items and clear out the good XP farming areas
---
My boyfriend and I do that when we're bored in-game.
---
1. Go to Whitespring Station (since it's in the middle of the map)
---
2. Both chug Nukashine
---
3. Run back to camp without using the map
---
4. First one in their bed wins
---
I'm in Morgantown and he's near Fort Defiance so sometimes we get super lucky and it's a cheap win and sometimes we're running the whole map. 
---
Once he got terribly lost going from the Ash Heap thinking he was smart taking the monorail line over, but he got tripped up near Silo Charlie. 
---
Once I got all sorts of messed up landing in the cabins between the Savage Divide and the Mire since I never really explored that. I thought I was way more south.
---
Nah, PC.
---
Sounds good buddy thank you and the adrenal reaction was the problem I just took it and went from 255 to 383 damage I can live with that lol
---
honestly, all my ammo save my black powder balls are from the world.  just learn which enemies tend to use which ammo, and farm the low levels.
---
to be fair though, all i use is .44, shotgun shells, .5mm, and balls.
---
They probably outgrew the set and just wanted to leave it for someone else. Enjoy it!
---
I just recently gave away two sets of calibrated x-01, and 2 sets of calibrated excavator. I often leave sets of power armor at stations when I need space.
---
Unless you've already done those. The only ones I have left are the 1000's, kill x with x 1000 times. Not completing those anytime soon.
---
Going to have to scrap some more handmaid's cuz I don't think I have that receiver yet but excited to try it
---
Yo OP, if you spent your caps to start it, fuck em all if they don't like how you run it.  I think you can click on ignore to stop hearing their asses.  You owe nothing to anyone.  Its the wasteland.
---
That makes me sad too because ultimately, that gives you an idea of the state of Fallout 76's player base. I don't mean that as a shot at the game, but 76 for all the bad or dumb things we've dealt with, it's a unique game on the market with no other direct competition for that exact game market. But Bethesda keeps shooting themselves with poor decisions that the game is treated as a joke by the community at large and more often than not, the new players free periods drag in seldom stay for long. They get bored and Bethesda's answer is "Bored? Try grinding this event, or.....you could just buy these atoms." But honestly, little about this event is incentive to spend real money and now they're essentially taking away the chance to earn atoms to lure in users.
---
I still remember my early days in the first days of 76 and the free atoms encouraged me to buy atoms. I don't think taking away atoms will win many new buyers and I don't intend to buy First. I can't justify 110 a year, or renew monthly. If they had a 6 month model? Maybe.
---
I thought I noticed no noticeable difference in NW the other day... lame
---
So this is a completely normal thing for high level players to do?
---
If I find or make a decent set, I look around for low levels to give it too. Kinda normal I guess.
---
You should see a therapist.
---
I like to imagine the overseer putting such effort into her clean ass decorated home
---
Installing and maintaining this incredibly clean kitchen complete with a working spotless modern sink that just pumps out the shittiest irradiated water and then calling it a day at that
---
Meh.
---
Really? Holy crap some of you will complain about anything.
---
I thought the same thing!
---
I found a Fasnacht Deathclaw mask in a vendor for 100 caps about a week after the event ended. I still feel guilty for buying it instead of telling the guy how much it was worth, but until I can travel back in time it'll be keeping my Raven mask company in my display case; that one I earned as a drop, and I thought it was a common worthless mask until I had people offering me tons of stuff when I wore it to the next instance of the event. Knowing how close I was to making the same mistake as the guy I bought the Deathclaw from makes me feel even worse.
---
\+1
---
IMHO NW is just plain weird. If it weren't for SCORE I wouldn't be there.
---
You've lost me
---
It comes down to two or three player views. One is those of us that liked and counted on our free Atoms, and we're pissed that they've taken them away after a year of having them. The other two are people that pay for 1st and don't care about the free Atoms nor the people that counted on them, and people who don't buy anything with Atoms and don't care about losing free Atoms.
---
Don't listen to those jerks -- just because you started the event doesn't mean you have to take a pylon.
---
People always give new people food, chems, armor and weapons so I fill the void by giving every single new player I see a full skeleton costume.
---
They didn't weight the mesh
---
Yeah you'd think if you've done 99% already you'd just complete the last 1% lol
---
Nope I always resell and I have not the slightest idea why you’re charging so little unless you’re on PC
---
If you're on PC there's a mod called Baka's glowing meat piles that... makes the meat piles glow.
---
But there ain’t exactly much content. Wastelanders was just about 20 hours of content including all the ally quests. The main game is maybe 100 hours including the side quests. But Fallout 3? I stayed awake for 130 hours straight going through all the side stories and I wasn’t even halfway done. Fallout 4 was the same. I started again yesterday I’m *still* discovering new things. I can’t say the same for 76.
---
76 disguises long and painful time gated mobile game like grinds as content. It really isn’t.
---
If you think this is the easiest, you haven't exposed yourself to many. RDO and Warframe both have easier passes. RDO's pass requires a premium currency buy-in, but rewards the player with that same amount of currency if they complete it and can be completed far easier. Warframe's pass is entirely free, rewards players with unique rewards for the first half of the season, and then continues to reward them with currency that can be used on high-demand items for the rest of the season. Warframe's challenges also don't disappear into the void the following week; if you complete the current week's challenges, it gives you ones you missed on previous weeks.
---
If you want to discuss with somebody who genuinely believes in their side, my reply is still up there for you.
---
You get 6 250point challenges and 1 500 point challenge each daily levels start at 1000 and add 25 points per level or something
---
If taking damage is NOT what you are good at, then don't do encryptid. You are being useless on that roof by the way. Change your build/playstyle or don't do the event. Nobody likes a leech at events.
---
Poseidon’s workshop
---
No problem man. Make sure you max demo expert too I think it’s a 60% dmg buff as well.
---
Lmao that's how I feel. People are always complaining about all the bugs but I'm just here in amazement that a Bethesda game with multiplayer functions at all.
---
Nope. Got my ghillie suit a few weeks ago, thats all I wanted out of it.
---
Ok yeah so thatd be 2000 points I'd have to make up which is an on going thing with the xp grind. I'm level 17
---
This one gets it
---
Ok but if so they should add a vendor that sells stable flux and related components. Maybe a Ghoul Vendor
---
I wish the vault tec rewards were up, I missed that whole event :(
---
Okay you can take take your attitude and white knight demeanor some place else, it’s a post not a liberal convention.
---
I would definitely pay for that lmao. for now, im camped out on the far side of Gnarled Shallows. decent spooky view and not an enemy yet. I also made a more mobile camp, so its not as irritating to move so often. Thanks for all the help!
---
As far as score rank goes
---
Boy, people get DoWnVoTeD over the most sane logical shit in this sub. 
---
You're so right. I just did my first nuke at level 115 the other day and it's the worst dungeon in the game. The most generic copy paste vault bullshit you could make. Uninspired, tedious and boring.
---
All I want is cranberries, glowing fungus and SNAPTAIL REEDS!!!
---
I hate it when you people complain about this and don’t do the math on your score level. 
---
When you make a post about this list your score rank and points. How many days you played and did you complete every single daily.
---
There is a bug that rewards your score before you complete the challenges.
---
2 fixers a bear arm a rad barrel and a shield lining raider under armor are my big ones
---
What exactly is fake news?
---
No thanks, I'm looking forward to the break in seasons.
---
Huh, interesting. I was under the impression they had fixed him in place behind his desk. Thanks.
---
It depends on how long the people take. I'm not the person you replied to, but I often take all 3 pylons and hide somewhere. If they people do good damage, I'm only using about a dozen stimpacks, but if they take the entire time, chances are I wasted roughly 100
---
I throw on first aid, field surgeon, escape artist and sneak, only take super stims. Usually take all three pylons, always be moving to stay hidden, get a couple shots in on her and only use a handfull of stims without dying. I play on xbox and find cola nut and quantums to be too clunky so this is my alternative.
---
-close
---
Did you ever find a resolution to this? Just started playing and I’m having the same issue with area being okay and team chat not working. Not sure what to do
---
We don’t talk about the raid.
---
I strongly suspect that swapping target location via Concentrated Fire will also fix the non-hits.  In my experience it seems to clear it up anyway.
---
As noted above that's odd, he's always sat behind his desk now for me, and I believe it was mentioned he was fixed in place so as to be easy to find for his quest.
---
The raid got removed by Bethesda. Reduced to atoms
---
Didn’t know about that, thanks
---
The damage numbers that pop up are essentially random number generators lol, they aren't the actual damage that occurs 
---
Who knows why this happens and what actually decides which of these mysterious numbers reveal themselves at any given time, only madness lie in attempting to decipher their true nature.
---
They doo doo numbers, Don't bother with em, calculate either by health bar, or probably more accurately how many hits to kill
---
Cavecrickets, Socrchbeasts, Glowing Ones, Assaultrons and Mole Miners with Missile Luanchers used to be the baddest mofos in Appalachia until i hit level 100. Now haha I hit'em with the mix tape!!!
---
This is likely because a lot of the developer resources went into converting the game into multiplayer. Instead of taking resources from the map development (the map is larger than all previous fallouts) they chose to lessen the story in this game. 
---
When I refer to the content I’m referencing the post launch content that has been slowly fed to us overtime. Frankly it’s not very much but if we asked for higher quality/less buggy it’s likely we would receive even less content from the devs. Then if you go back to my previous comment you’ll see why less content is worse than reasonably buggy content.
---
If you can read and follow the directions then I don't care how you play. But if you don't do any of the objectives that the event tells you to do, then I am gonna lecture you. It goes both way.
---
i learned to hate cave crickets back in fo4...
---
raid is gone 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
I believe the problem with all the new people is that most are going to want to be XP level boosted, get full sets of armor, and god roll weapons in the first weak. I big slap to everyone who’s been playing for two years. Then they’ll leave or barely play because they don’t want to commit to an MMORPG. It will definitely lower your chances of finding weapons/armor your looking for.
---
I am on PC. I never sell at "market" rates. With the stupid and insane costs most players ask from their vendors I do everything I can to bust the market. Most BPs and Recipes at my vendor go for 1 cap. I sell God roll weapons, I only keep good ones in stock, go for less than 1K. Power to the people baby. I have sales every single day. :P
---
Yeah that's what we need, less content. Brilliant.
---
I really enjoy 76, but this is the worst part of the game for me BY FAR. I feel like I have to collect and keep everything, I have all the outfits I could fine, I keep all the notes/holotapes etc. Cooking is painful, bulking hurts, and transferring apparel basically freezes the game (PS4 Pro). Oh and do not get me started on weapon switching while under fire.
---
&gt;!I had just entered vault 79 after motherlode, and with all the activity from the turrets, I could NOT switch weapons using my weapon wheel. Literally 30 seconds of stuck in the wheel, unable to move, while being laid into with turrets and gutsys.!&lt;
---
Big time. For a lot of us, helping lower level players is the end game.
---
No I’m done trying to convince anyone about how the pass itself is fairly reasonable as season passes go. I know I will easily complete it before 10 weeks are up and I do have a job and other hobbies so I won’t be constantly grinding like everyone expects you have to be either. You can continue to complain about a free reward system that only gives out xp buffs, cosmetic skins and camp items unlike others like destiny 2 which actually punishes you for not completing the whole pass or for not playing at all unlike this one.
---
I've noticed with a shotgun when you even go up close it will miss at 95% chance. It looks like the game is aiming at the side of the head when I shoot too. Sometimes its so bad I can even see my gun flip out
---
&gt; random number generators lol, they aren't the actual damage that occurs 
---
I definitely believe that. Thing that pissed me off while testing this is the "3" damage I did to the Charred feral ghoul. How does a gun with a damage of over 3000 do 3?
---
The better way to go about it would be to take over a power plants workshop. The one at Poseidon is probably the easiest of them. They will have a ready made fusion core extractor there. All you have to do is hook up power to it, put a lock on the extractor and return periodically to empty it out
---
Yes it’s normal for high lvl players to drop gifts for lowbies.
---
Agreed, nothing worse than some dickhead starting the event someone else paid for.
---
Are the power plants not giving you enough?
---
That’s the thing. This isn’t “reasonably buggy”, half the time I can’t complete the dailies. Beckett’s quest markers don’t show up, but thankfully I knew where everything was from when I did it on my main. But when I got to the place I was meant to go, the item usually wasn’t there. Or in the case of trying to find the Claw, Beckett treated me like I wasn’t his. Like I was a stranger. Restarting 76 often fixed the issue but I shouldn’t have to do that. I’m grinding out another 20 or so levels so I can have my melee character totally set up for absolutely everything he needs, and doing the ally and main quests is the fastest way.
---
Best thing you can do is queue solo, find a bush, and alt-tab to something else. Don't even let it be an active part of your day.
---
[the fo76 interactive map](https://fo76map.com) shows some. seems to be not all to me but i dont use PA and never look for cores.
---
I'm hoping the next big update would be more story based but its not going to be. The fan service of bringing back the BoS before other factions shows what's probably going to be more focused on these grind mechanics.
---
Responders make more sense as a faction to bring back since anybody could join them and a force to counter the Raiders makes sense.
---
I would of liked to see Flatwoods start up again and stories focused around helping people and maybe creating more of your own narrative.
---
Hell, what would be great is that players can make their C.A.M.P.S have unique missions. Meaning you can add either backstop for your character or something more casual.
---
But just give us a chance to feel more connected with our actual characters
---
I can't tell if you're being a smartass or not. The Legendary Run they just put in, with the whole space themed board game. 
---
It's a season/battle pass system, the same one almost every other BR has. Fucking Destiny even has one and they're not even a BR. It's free, is the only difference. A free battle pass.
---
They were lifted from the last Fallout 4 DLC (along with rats) so they are stronger than they should be compared to other enemies at that level.  Hopefully this all gets worked out in the One Appalachia Update.
---
I would like to know too. I ended up buying the one from the secret service but it looks stupid with my SS armor bc of the damn leaf branches coming out the sides lol and novody wants to sell one for caps
---
I’m a bloodied build and have no problem tanking all 3 pylons and soloing the iss. Keep your hp slightly above nerd rage threshold, about 30%. All you need then is one pychobuff, 5-7 superstims. Take the stim each time you take a pylon. End the event in less than 3 minutes.
---
Check player vendors. Hover over their icon and check the number of plans they have for sale. They are in pretty much every player vendor that has more than a handful of plans for sale.
---
Saaaaame!
---
It's to do with the survival tents. If you have FO1st and place your tent in the normal scorched spawn point they'll all spawn in front of the building. Great for xp farming
---
There it is. Its all about "easier" with you jack asses. you want everything handed to you on a silver platter.
---
If the game was any fucking easier it would be pathetic
---
I farm at Thunder Mountain or Monongah, usually.
---
Any of the 3 power plants are the best place to obtain fusion cores.
---
I still carried a few guns on my unarmed character, though.
---
One for SBQ (it would be better that I can still dash out some damage while she's keeping off ground most of the time), one explosive automatic weapon for mass tag event, and one explosive double barrel shotgun when I need to crippled something.
---
18
---
It's cumulative and full minutes. I did it today in 3 matches surviving around 10 mins each.
---
It now only drops as a rare reward from Savage Divide events. In which you get a set of both masks and the jumpsuits available. 
---
Mr. Messenger no matter where it spawns counts as one, One Violent Night, Uranium Fever, Someone to talk to, distinguished guests, Guided meditation. That's it.
---
The expectation is that people who do every single daily/weekly should be able to reach 100, with the repeatable available as an option for people who want to grind it out faster.
---
However, the system is not designed that way. You have to do the repeatable a ton to even qualify for 100. You have to do it even more if the challenges bug out and auto-complete without rewards like they've done for many people.
---
As for "no other BP is like this", Warframe's pass rewards the unique rewards for the first half of the season while later ranks give currency for cosmetics or resources. Imagine the current legendary run but with all the inconsequential rewards taken out and all the unique stuff crammed in the first 50 levels, with all the later levels rewarding points that can be spent on bullion, scrip, atoms, etc. It's also entirely free, and definitely not built around an option to whale out cash to skip the thing entirely.
---
They’re sick! Insane attention to detail. Highly recommended my friend
---
u/ladydevann is there anything you can do to help?
---
Wait really? Like actually gone? Gone gone?
---
If you just move camp the vendors won't reset. Nor will any displays.
---
However if you can't place your camp and you need to store things they get reset.
---
When moving camp, place down individual foundations that are separated to anything else Move your vendors/displays onto those . Then move. This way it doesn't matter if your camp can't be placed. The foundations wit vendors will be blueprinted separately and can be placed down fully stocked.
---
Yeah because that’s the kind of notes people would leave...
---
But why make that particular quest a priority when it ultimately involves silos and scorchbeasts? Not having a go at you btw. Im just really curious at the thought process here
---
21 but the xp grind is alot. I'm level 416 now and yeah... Gained 10 of them since it started. Could do with boosting the repeatable a little to be honest.i don't mind a good grind but only so many times you can do things in a day without it becoming mind numbing.
---
It'd be nice if we could switch between dailies being for score or atoms bc now we are backed into a corner of having to pay for atoms now that daily and weekly are now score only
---
I don’t know if energy resistance plays a role into tanking the pylons. But you sure can try to amp it up to run the event. I always run this event when I’m nearly at max caps, easiest-hard event to run imo.
---
Just wait a little bit longer, it will show up, always.
---
Or just keep a weightless 3 star shovel on you...
---
4 day old troll account not only is he a miserable fucker but is a pathetic one who finds a need to troll forum boards instead of doing anything else more valuable with his precious minutes he has in his life.
---
Probably, yeah. But even doing the daily events completion should've gotten you to 10k. One way you can check is to see if your total score is divisible by 250. Because the 10k exp only rewards 100 each time.
---
Gotchs my bad ill delete and repost there
---
My main is low health but I am always prepared to solo the imposter. I hit the decon shower, put on a full set of troubleshooter armor, and swap some perks. Need blocker and fire proof, plus buff your stims or colas to burst heal through the pylon damage. You can use any weapon, i go with a troubleshooter dcg because you can buff melee considerably even at full health. Even if i didn't start the event myself I still get things changed around in plenty of time
---
BASED
---
Be real for a second, how could they possibly balance a season for someone who does so little combat they only level once a week? Maybe it's just not for you and that's ok.
---
I never vote for flatwoods due to the fact  there are no good water sources to hide in :]
---
I've waited for around around half an hour a couple of times in hopes they would but they still never show up :(
---
Tonight I found myself way south east near Watoga, started heading north west but had to go over the mountains. Found a Legendary Sheepsqatch and ran. Got turned around in the bogs and found a road. Followed that to find Watoga...again. Took me the better part of 4 hours to finally make it to Whitesprings. It was fun though.
---
I did the 10k xp. Might be for the first time. Gonna start grinding events from now on
---
This is the reason
---
Oh my god... it really has been.
---
I have a small portable base that I can place anywhere. The vendor stays full as long as you place it from blueprint/stored. Make sure the structure is small, there are no objects hanging over an edge, and there are no stairs touching the ground as this can mess with the placement. Also if you use any glitches in your build this could cause the blueprint to be unusable.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but smelting steel with acid is quite inefficient (considering acid isn't really that easy/convenient to farm in thousands), especially when you're low level and still do not have thousands of it.
---
That's just what they're sharing, though, right? I want to see their entire perk loadout so I know if sharing level 5 gunsmith (or whatever) is wasted.
---
Flatwoods? More like "better have frog legs because this shit isn't flat at all" woods
---
It’s crazy to me how so many people are downvoting you and actually upset that you are enjoying the season pass even though you aren’t worried about getting every single reward. This is the only game I’ve seen this many people complain about a free season pass with free content just for playing. It’s only cosmetic rewards unlike destiny 2 which actually punishes the player for not completing everything. I guess people here are too worried they won’t have a certain cosmetic or camp item?
---
Yeah, I forget that people don't run at least 3 charisma. All of my 20 characters have a minimum of 6 to 9 charisma, with four at 15 charisma (one on each account).
---
It isn’t, but bugthesda doesn’t know much about how to fix the game, the Halloween and Christmas challenges are back until hopefully they patch them tomorrow
---
12.  No shame in my game.
---
I'm with you there and I have caught it for the years its been out. I'm enjoying the game. I enjoy the grind. I hate the issues of course but I work through them.
---
Hey, that's not so bad at all
---
Frog legs? Nah man fish lungs!
---
44 currently.  Cleared everything day 1 and then took a few days off before starting to hard grind.
---
Hey me too! Its getting gruesome i also missed a few days
---
I sold two fixer plans for my vendor cap of 100 a couple weeks ago. Everything in my store usually hovers around 50 max tbh. Don't really have a need for caps since I maxed my RP build (stealth sniper) already so I usually just price everything cheap to minimize inventory space and give people a reason to visit my camp. I'm up in the mountains outside the Cranberry Bog so I don't get a lot of visitors there but the view of Watoga and the SBQ bomb drop is beautiful. RndomWittyName on PS4.
---
No never had that problem
---
&gt;44
---
**What the fuck**
---
24... I’ve been trying to get a tier from my dailies and another from XP.
---
👋 Me! I enjoy it somewhat and have even scratched out a win or two. It’s especially nice that the previous rewards(Christmas and Halloween)are being granted as well as the current ones.
---
I'm only on lvl 16... fuck. Guess I gotta grind the xp repeatable a LOT more. UghHHHHHH.
---
I only just started playing Nuclear Winter because of these but I'm hopelessly bad at the mode so I missed a couple of those challenges. Hopping on to get the survive 30 minutes challenge -- does it have to be all in one match or just over time? If it's the former, that's a lot tougher -- if it's the latter then no big.
---
Dont even need to do math... just search like i did lol Math is hard but google is easy :P
---
Also OP, the bug is that you get rewarded at 3/5 in the weekly challenege, so when you get to 5/5 you dont get the reward as you already got it at 3/5
---
I rarely find people uncooperative in these kinds of events. The event was bugged today, where all pylons were activated, but the Sheepsquatch was still invisible and taking no damage.
---
That's good stuff. I wonder if the RNG is run for the entire server so some of us get good stuff and others get nothing.
---
I shoot them down because the explosion is so satisfying :D
---
its gone. but i suspect that raids will make a return at some point. 
---
there will also be something called daily ops coming
---
and something called expeditions, which might take us outside of Appalachia
---
I mean yea true people might leave mean shit too. But I'm all for mean shit
---
What about a good way to get lots of steel? I know about luckyhole but I’m always low on steel when making 2mm...
---
Hey never thought to do this - great idea - thanks!!
---
Yeah, you just have a different one.
---
So I’m mainly playing for fun ( building a base, nuking places, helping other people) so If I wanna launch nuclear missiles at places I gotta complete that quest and I simply don’t have the weapons or armor to kill a scorch beasts and multiple high level enemy’s and yes I k ow there is a lot of security in the Silos
---
Same here. Once I got the ammo converter, flawed as it is, the rest of the rewards feel like bonus items now. Public teams has been more of a game changer for me than the season or it’s rewards. Having been a dedicated Lone Wanderer for so long, it’s given me a change of pace I needed. I’m playing the game to have fun, and I refuse to let FOMO turn any video game into a job.
---
yeah, sure.. what could go wrong?
---
Auto completing? What does that mean? I don't want to lose any score especially since I'm already a few lvls behind where I should be..
---
Upvote for noting that the number of invincible characters has grown notable from FO:3 -&gt; today 
---
Not being able to permanently lose companions in Survival mode of 4...oof.
---
Displayed numbers are...wildly inaccurate.  Sometimes.
---
I've got one of those 'magic' weapons (a minigun) that does a lot more damage than it should.  Not queen melting damage, but definitely a lot.  It shows anywhere from 3-5 damage, but if you look at the amount of damage being taken off her health bar, it's a LOT more than that.
---
It works both ways though.  Sometimes it shows too little, other times it shows too much.  Shotguns are the opposite of my mini, it rarely does as much damage as it shows (though it can do more).  It's...buggy.  
---
Old engine, not designed to be used online, cobbled together with prayers and duct tape.  And the performance shows.
---
For the most part, it works, but any time you're in a situation where you need to communicate back and forth with the server quickly, it can be wildly unpredictable.
---
Any
---
:(
---
The survival items are also unlocking
---
I just started playing again and didnt have any cores saved up. I used to run strictly in power armor. I didnt e ven know power plants could give you cores. I'm only 40 so most of the time a high lvl comes by and takes things over.
---
This one time there was a white blind man walking down the street right, he had his stick and everything right and he walked past the fish market, he took a deep sniff and yelled “good morning ladies!”
---
Having the same issue still unfortunately :( sometimes neither works, sometimes one works, sometimes both works, it’s whenever it feels like it
---
Equip scrapper when scrapping weapons or armour for steel, places I personally go to for steel farming are west tek, hunters ville and that event at fort defiance, I just take their gear and scrap it, I also scrap all the gear I don’t need with the scrapper perk equiped, hope this helps
---
Bro I check this subreddit everyday and have not seen one post about this so please don’t direct your condescending tone to me.
---
Edit: by the way apparently this just started happening so go ahead and tell me you see this post “every day”
---
I liked them way more than Paige lol
---
I never got them so I hope they don’t patch them.
---
Got a tse handmade for 1500 caps at a players vendor. Was quite happy :)
---
The power of personal situations making one not care to do anything.  The mindless grind while watching videos between loading screens/server hops keeps me occupied.  Also take a slice of time to workout a bit.
---
Your "convincing" involves ignoring half of the points of other people and just being plain ill-informed for the other half, so it's no wonder it accomplishes nothing. No skin off mine or anybody elses bones if you proceed to shut up. I'll be checking up in 9 weeks to see how you're keeping up.
---
Right now yeah. But I’ve played with it on my stealth rifle man and it’s still pretty nice. It one shots all mobs. Semi auto I got it up to 450 base. Like I said tho the BE lever is king for semi auto it hits at 800 dmg base with sneaks you can see damage of like 5k on head shots
---
you will needs someone to anchor you to the world is you do not own a private server.
---
my advice is to position the alt and your main at the exact same spot so that you can do the transfer as fast a posible.
---
for example, place both your toons at the rusty pick, and use the cigarette machine as your transfer container. when you load in, all you have to do is run forward and collect. this reduced the risk of getting robbed or taking too long and losing the server.
---
unfortunately, for the more reliable and stable way to do a transfer is to use a private world. which you would have to buy FO1st to use.
---
Vampire totally where it's at with this Robo-bitch. My 3* vamp flamer melts her every time and I finish with nearly the same hp as I went in even while holding all three pylons.
---
RIP
---
&gt;	So when you reach lvl 25, go to Garrahan Mining Headquarters (in the ash heap) and start the quest ‘Miner Miracles’. Do this quest and you’ll get the excavator power armour which increases the amount you get from mining ore veins by 4 times and also increases your carry weight by 100.
---
That’s exactly what I’m trying to do. I just want a power armor suit.
---
With the system i propose you could take a break when you like, not when your overlord tells you you can.
---
The score system is the only reason why I bother with NW. It's not really my cup of tea as I don't really care for the rush and competition. All I have to do is spawn, choose a bush and do something else. I don't opt for teams obviously. I am shocked to see how easy it is to just survive by doing absolutely nothing. Finding a good bush, move in, etc.
---
that pucker when you see a yao guai tho
---
thankfully the randoms spawns are often enough that I can satisfy my desire to murder them all to death.. it keeps me sane...
---
Well that sucks.. I thought I spent atoms on it, but can't remember...
---
Power fist, mole miner gauntlet, deathclaw gauntlet....
---
It's the same efficiency as lead, 5 scrap per acid. I agree guns are they way to go low level since they're everywhere while acid is a lot rarer. Then again, grabbing paint, weights and can chimes would also be an easier time for newer players as well since they litter low level zones.
---
Personally, I used to run a minigun so acid farming was a large part of my time, and those habits have me stockpiling in the hundreds or thousands now, so ore tends to be easier for me. Though there's always server hopping at toxic Larry's for about 20 acid per minute or tangara town/flooded trainyard if you want to skip the hops.
---
18.5, would be 20 but it auto completed two of the weekly challenges due to a crash upon start up on Tuesday :/
---
The Sheepsquatch plush is honestly what I'm after, everything else is just a bonus!
---
Other perks seem to not be functioning properly as well. We all know about Adrenaline, fireproof for me has been wonky, and someone else on this sub mentioned stabilized not working either. More things seem to have broken than we realized
---
Those are unarmed:)
---
Yes. Have you tried grenadier?
---
My opinion is that, if they intend on having grinds like this, at least make a diverse range of things to grind. Not just 2 events and some challenges because that's it. 
---
I've been doing these same events for the past 2 years now, I only just finished a bullion grind that almost made me quit the game due to the pattern it was getting me into. 
---
Maybe I'm just getting older, idk, but I love grinding in games. Especially when the grind is engaging. When one day I can grind PVP, then the next day I can grind dungeons and build. 
---
I spend lots of time grinding out other battle passes because they give me the agency and freedom to grind without stupid limitations imposed to stretch out content.
---
I actively defended this seasonal pass system before it was added because I'm a grinder and I seen this as a huge positive but Bethesda's implementation is nothing short of missing the mark. 
---
The grind isn't engaging, nor is it diverse. If you enjoy doing the same things that we have been doing for the past 2 years, more heavily since Wastelanders due to the bullion grind, then more power to you. 
---
I really hope they improve on this system and get to a point where S.C.O.R.E. can be earned through more than just challenges, specific events, and a tedious 10k XP loop grind. 
---
The game hasn't let me just play the way I want for a while now, without missing out on all these things and it frustrates me and many others who would grind to our hearts content, if they just let us instead of holding our hand day by day. 
---
It just ends up feeling like a chore "oh its reset time, better get on and get my challenges done then not play again until this time tomorrow" yknow? Most other games I can log in and just play whenever and actually feel like I'm progressing. 
---
(Deleted my other comment to restructure, apologies for the whiney attitude too. I'm not good with words)
---
in hoards dont you want to keep the boss alive to potentially spawn more legendary mobs?
---
Very interesting I might play a lot of nuclear winter now
---
If you want power armour, I’d recommend going to watoga, there’s a lot of suits there or just search fallout 76 interactive map online and filter power armour so it’s the only one on - also what lvl are you as most power armours cap at lvl 50
---
Even so most often a random Yao Guai or Scorched will kill the horde boss as soon as I land competing the event
---
This is more important than adrenaline imo
---
I’m level 22. I’m trying to get to lvl 25. Also thanks for the suggestion.
---
Unfortunately I am one of those people who are only on NW for SCORE. 
---
These are all just my experiences and I am not hating anyone for enjoying NW:
---
-The game itself is not a great FPS or TPS. It’s not at all a great shooter. Why is that? Because the engine itself wasn’t specially designed for a shooting game whereas today we have millions of specialized FPS engines.
---
-it’s incredibly slow - I run it on an Xbox1 so all of the menus load slow, the lag is terrible (I have no problems on other games), and the menus are very complex for a battle royale
---
-No communication options for non-mic users. The emotes aren’t great. I’m not buying any more for money and the default ones are clearly meant for a survival game not a competitive battle royale.
---
I am also just bad at it in general so I suppose it’s not really valid for me to say if it’s bad or not.
---
I did start playing and was pleasantly surprised to be awarded Halloween and Christmas gear but was disappointed to hear it was a bug. I think the game mode needs more rewards to attract players.
---
Just over 19, I had hoped to be at 20 but this is still good. I
---
Just happy to get the stars wallpaper. Hopefully I'll get to 35 by end of week 2. I have no worries about getting to 100 before ten weeks.
---
Imagine being so petty and negative because I’m not having any issues with this pass and I shared why it shouldn’t be an issue in my opinion without magically acknowledging how everyone feels about it at the same time. If you actually care enough to worry about how far I personally will have made it by 10 weeks then you have a personal problem that has nothing to do with me but more to do with just being right and saying “I told you so”. Go play destiny 2’s season pass if you wanna keep complaining this heavily to a random like me who just disagrees with you. “No skin off my back”
---
Yeah, that sounds good. For the head, the ranger helmet does work too. Just so long as your head is in a bush enough that you can’t just see your visor.
---
I started a third character, walked up to the two npcs outside of the vault and saw a bag with a shit-ton of rare weapon plans, mods, recipes, and even rare plans from the events that aren't available anymore that I missed out on.
---
Best community ever, inspired me to do the same with my first character for other newbies.
---
My second character doesn't give a rat's ass tho. She's a raider, although gives free ammo but that's because she wants to see the world burn. Muahaha!
---
I do combat, just I'm not *good* at it. I do way more building and exploring... basicly, the right side of the map is too strong for me, despite being level 240. It takes an entire clip to kill a single Super Mutant over there and a Sheepsquatch in that area? Man. 10 minutes and several hundred rounds? Maybe a thousand? 
---
It's *crazy* over there. I went to the … shoot. Wes-Tek? I went there three times, only made it inside once and, boy howdy, was that a bad idea.
---
For those who say the game's too easy? Maybe on the broken builds, but for people like me, it's insanely hard. The Mire's bad, while the Bog is a no-go. Heck, I still haven't finished the main quest as I have utterly no idea how nuke codes work and I know I can't deal with the robots there. Assaultrons are murder machines.

---
I've found that if you try to place an item somewhere you know it can go, but it won't let you, to just plop it down somewhere else then move it to the desired location. For some reason 'building' sometimes gets buggy, but 'moving' an item seems to work better.
---
Its funny how you can’t fast travel to a Nukezone but auto respawn has no trouble placing you right in the middle of it.
---
I often drop t51 nuka cola painted sets for giggles. Not as often,there might be a quantum X01 dropped occasionally too.
---
I have a total of 20 items on me and 5 notes / holos from quests
---
Bethesda. I know this community likes to shit all over everything you do but I genuinely find the new score system a lot of fun and it gives me a lot of stuff to do as an end game player. I know this is just one of a bunch of things you're adding and I want to say that I think it's a hell of an improvement.
---
 I used to save bubblegum just for the stupid bubblegum daily and all sorts of silly hoops I had to do in order to complete those quests. These are infinitely better. 
---
Don't let all the haters get you guys down.

No, it’s absolute dogshit but if you like it have fun with it I guess

Okay well. Besides any UNARMED melee you can use anything

No problem, if you want to level up faster, there’s guides about places to go to for farming xp, places I can think of that are ok for players your level are the Charleston capitol building and the whitesprings golf course - but the golf course is pretty hard if you don’t have a high dmg weapon, as the enemies there are high lvl ghouls
---
I am...had 136 perk packs to open earlier this week when I logged into NW. LoL. Now, I log into NW, try to do whatever the daily challenge is as well as work on some of the other challenges listed in the main challenge area. I am not a fan of NW and avoid it as much as possible lol.
---
It means the dailies mark as complete and you get no SCORE.
---
I just had this problem. Finished 3 weekly challenges and got nothing for it. Incredibly fucked. Take your busted ass system down and fix it!
---
I'll keep voting on it anyway.
---
I don't do junkies because I don't tap into drugs at all. 
---
.
---
As for the railrifle? I just don't like it. Too much space on the screen and trying to charge it's just weird. I mostly use a standard .308 rifle and a revolver, with a ghoul-slayer's Fixer for when I have to deal with ghouls (which are TERRIFYING). 
---
VATS, however, I HAVE to use. I can't hit the broad side of a barn without it.
---
There are two bugs. 
---
One, your score is awarded at 3/5 for the challenge. It will not award additional score at 5/5. (you are most likely here) 
---
Two, your challenge completes automatically and you get no score at all and no chance to actually do the challenge. (quite a few of us are here, as am I) this is related to the NW bug that was supposed to have been fixed with this update, but it wasn't.
---
I'd like the power armor cause it sets u apart from alot of people, but the chicken coop is what I'm trying to get
---
25 but I'm not going to be able to keep the same pace, I'm already tired of it.
---
Yeah that's why I avoid the legendary and let everyone have it, it's just weird to me people are immediately angry because they haven't had their turn. It's not like it's a super rare and super special thing. The event itself is there multiple times a day. You have multiple events and locations to kill legendaries.
---
I think I have one you can buy from me.  I am logging in now and will get back to you on here.
---
OMG! It’s like you’re a total asshole and have nothing better to do then to prove a point on reddit! Do me a favor if it annoys you so much don’t respond to it. Just scroll by. There’s no need to comment on a post and be an asshole. Like you really took time out of your day to be a jerk like that’s amazing.
---
You forget that not all of us play the same. I know for sure that i do not have any of the perks open that most players find useful, had a friend as me once what they use most and share. I also have 89 cards I could switch/open if I wanted according to my pip-boy. I have simply opened the cards I needed and delegated the points I felt worked best for my game play, and not anyone else. LoL.

Grind lol

How exactly does power levelling work because of god mode?

I get that is impossible to kill you while you’re in god mode but if that’s it, then we’ll I’m already nigh on impossible to kill.

Such a fine idea I might have to

I cop the travel fee and fast travel to the bunker now after I got dumped into a nuke zone once and instantly vaporised pretty much
---
Jeez, thanks for the heads up. Would love to see some communication from the developers on this.
---
I already have the ghillie siit so now I'm working on the jack o lantern armor skin. Then I'll be happy.
---
So does the chemist perk affect the amount of ore collected when mining?
---
Is it the full helmet ? Or the thin mask type one you have ?
---
It allows you to stack xp bobble heads
---
And get 4k xp with one kill
---
I break this event. I run a bloodied power armor build with emergency protocols and lifegiver, and a vampire's gatling laser. I grab all 3 pylons and just unload with my gatling laser and it keeps me alive, unless the assaultron hits me dead on.
---
More to the point, fuck those people. They should contribute to the event like everyone else, I'm sure they were just there to one shot the assaultron and steal the legendaries.
---
Ooohhhhh
---
Can I stack str bobbles too? Or does that not work?
---
I wish they did this... even a small amount of SCORE for doing events would be great, it would also encourage more ppl to do events
---
Just hit 20 with today's challenges. I've missed I think two NW dailies that I just make up for with XP, but I somehow feel super behind. I think I'm doing fine, but progress feels so slow. *I want that secret door, damn it!*
---
I’m ps4, I’m level 93 and all my gear has energy resistance and I still get melted by those wall turrets
---
Someone in the comments said so, I can’t get on right now so I can’t see if it works but I guess if you have enough perk points, you could test it
---
I run auto railway on my commando setup and its great until the vats just cancels itself for no apparent reason and I'm suddenly staring straight up.
---
Probably. I upgrade people's weapons give them free stuff and help build their homes
---
It’s the one that looks like the Chinese stealth armor helmet.
---
Maybe but Ill keep voting for it anyway.

Considering one guy on this very thread is Level 44, I can see how could you get that feeling

Anything stacks in GM

Chems, Uny Armour and as a bonus you're invincible

I dont care about that i just want xp to go from lvl 35 to 50

Yeah thank you but im looking for the full helmet one, it kinda looks like the combination of a gas mask and combat armour helmet
---
Well, I have a BE laser so we can probably do that at some point if you’re on Xbox
---
I felt the pain of using a level 10 BSS sledgehammer and a Chinese Stealth suit 😂 for 40 levels
---
I don't get it. I'm not hardcore, these challenges are super easy so it's really not hard at all to do all the challenges in anywhere from half an hour to an hour

Aighty, is there a better place for plastic outside of Morgantown HS cafeteria and the cat lady's house / Watoga HS cafeteria?

Shotgun ammo, y'know.
---
Fair point,
---
Finally had the time and bandwidth to finish down loading the update yesterday. 
---
I'm level 3 with 750 SCORE (yah I know get good...) 
---
From what I can see the dailies that I finished yesterday and today account for my current rank.
---
Maybe I missed something, but it's kinda annoying not seeing the progress bar move.
---
Couldn't care less about Gail but I love Ra-Ra. The raiders have so many more cool quests and characters.
---
I'm 15 I think but played more then I typically would.
---
Sorry dude, it’s the tactical one.  I used to have the other one, but I guess I accidentally scrapped it.
---
Lol sweet I'm on xbox 
---
Now I just gotta ask my bud for some xp bobble heads 
---
I ran out of gold so not today if you're down with this ill dm you
---
I just get tired of everything they do people complain about it . I like the game and agree somethings aren't the greatest . Just think people should play the game or quit so the rest of us can without always seeing negativity
---
Yea that’s what happened to me I just kept dying but I am very determined to get something done once I start it but holy hell that was just impossible to do solo especially without my PA. I need a two handed melee weapon that I can use whilst in PA so that’s why. I didn’t even bring it with me. If I’m going to do this solo I’m going to need a plan or something cause I seriously didn’t know the silos were this difficult
---
You can't actually build on a building team anyway. The game wont let you build anything at each public team members CAMPS. They should never have named it "Building" in the first place.
---
No problem at all thanks for trying :)
---
&gt; Just thinking tactically and realistically. Raiders clearly have 0 sense and self-preservation tactics. 
---
easiest way to take them out, just tell Gail that Meg said RaRa was a little Brat and that she thinks Gail is a big ole Dummy.
---
Would you know how much xp for the hallowean glow skele costume?
---
Yeah, that's... A lot of XP. Way more than I've even thought people would want to grind. I want this stuff but I don't want to totally burn myself out before the next season.
---
In my experience vats is only accurate with certain perk cards that are completely irrelevant to vats accuracy (I’m not sure what exact cards are the ones that help, I think it may be tenderizer) edit: this is with commando weapon/build
---
Upvoting because a) you’re right and b) who the hell is downvoting this comment? The downvoters in this forum are mad with power.

I seem to always have enough plastic as I’m a hoarder but I guess if you haven’t already, it could be worthwhile looking online for plastic farming guides

Seems like I’ve stumped you. Maybe try re-examining your position?
---
I've gotten an automatic legendary during the last few Encryptid events I've been in. I thought they *had* made it automatic.
---
I had it before on ps4. Logged off, then on, and it was back to "normal"
---
I was there because of SCORE, stayed to get a few Christmas and Halloween skins that I wanted.
---
Im absolutely not saying it's the best thing; compared to when it wasn't there... Yes it's a little better. 
---
I stopped playing few days after fasnacht ended cause i was literally only logging for photo op, ally daily, settlers and raiders daily, thats really it. Got boring real fast and went back to other games.
---
The BP got me back, i still do those daily quests but in addition to that i also do the daily challenges adding a little variety makig me play for longer than i was aticipating which is good cause im having fun doing this.
---
Throw in a bunch of NW matches on my dedicated NW alt  for the NW challenge and tere you go, played 4hours without realzing it.
---
This is what I was thinking, and I am not sure if I have that mutation I’d have to check. I wanted to go full melee but I feel it’s impossible to do full melee in a silo just way too many turrets I can’t reach.
---
Borderlands 3 does this and it's nice.
---
It was so amusing to hear Gail desperately asking me to find Ra-Ra that I replaced all supermutant speech files with her lines about finding Ra-Ra. Farming West-Tek had never been so hilarious :D
---
Yeah I'm terrible at aiming in game anyways (hence why I go with a stealth VATS build).
---
But it's just not the best. I feel like it takes way too long to level.
---
You're not wrong but I personally wasn't. I was only doing dailiy quests and logging off.
---
I'm with you OP. There needs to either be more group types with a separate bonus selection, as you say, or we need to be able to add a group objective or something, so people know what the group is for, even just a way to add a subtitle to the group when you create it, so people know what its actually for, say limit it to 12 characters or something, should be sufficient to put down "XP farming", "Nuke run silo b" etc.
---
I like you!
---
One of my personal rules is to never attack a fellow waterbreather in our natural element.  I always salute and move along, though it tends to freak people out.
---
Yay im still going to lone wolf
---
Who comments a day late on some stale argument? Guy, please let me assure you that I'm not stumped. I just don't care what your opinion or assessment is and don't feel the need to carry on like you seem to do. I literally cannot remember what it was we were even talking about. Sorry.
---
I’ve been thinking the exact same thing.
---
Indeed Public Teams are a game changer!  
---
I also just read that Tenderizer is applied AFTER all other bonuses. So i'm gonna put a lvl 3 Tenderizer + Strange in Numbers with those 4 CHA points!
---
XP exploiters are dominating the board, we'll probably have lvl 100 players by week 4
---
You Sir have raised a great kid! My hat goes off to you.
---
I like the charge of pace, gives me something different to do
---
On the other side, those of us who enjoy NW mode only get 250 score from it per day, and the XP earned in NW doesn't go toward the 10k XP weekly for some reason.
---
Soo
---
Sounds fun. Or just be lazy and have three different quests and rotate them like Vault raids.
---
Bugthesda doing its thing. Fixes one thing, breaks another. Honestly I’d rather them devote time to fixing issues than adding content.
---
They did say that but he’s definitely still occasionally not at his desk.
---
The nearest shovel you can find (I know this from the time where I didn't carry one with me all the times, so I hope it hasn't changed) is running down the hill and where there are the frames of cars or maybe a truck and a couple of enemies, there you have one.
---
Is this why I can headshot crit a scorchbeast for 2.5k with a charged gauss rifle shot and all it does is tickle it? Would have thought that would be close to sufficient damage for a one shot. Definitely comes close when manually aiming, but the damage numbers that show in VATS seem to be totally wrong, like its doing 1% of what it says.
---
Hate this just joined one and no one went to the pylons and I had to do all of them and waste like 60 stimpack because it was killing me fast, we ended up failing it because no one did anything which is frustrating. It’s like no one knows how to do or their so legendary hungry they try to get hits in on all the legendaries, mostly the  imposter like it doesn’t matter if you can’t kill the  fucking thing.
---
I think I was level 25-27 before I finally got frog legs.  I can appreciate the concerns that it’s a near mandatory perk, but I did get goat legs early on, and my initial “run” was across the bridge.  It didn’t happen often, but when people saw me jump and jumped after me were some of my funniest NW moments.
---
Personally I want Radcliffe. i dig his sense of humour and snark.
---
Why are you like this?
---
See this is why I want a child one day to be able to play games with them and teach them not to be trolls. Kindness in games can go a very long way. From they rewarding others. Then being rewarded back from someone else another day. There was so much I didnt know about the game when I first started playing. I did basically the same thing as you. Played for a while before wastelenadera and left when I got to like lvl 15 for a year. Came back a week or so before wastelands. Now I'm about level 105 or 106. The game is so much more fun and enjoyable than it was at first and ive meet some really amazing and kind people on there. Still low on caps as always. But ill manage😂. But you seem like a great dad. And your son should be very very proud to have you as his dad. I know I would've :)
---
Yep. Killed two deathclaws on the grass at the back of the white springs green the other day. The legendary disappeared as soon as it was dead. The non-legendary level 21 hung around to give  me a steak and a deathclaw hide though, so, yay?
---
So you can show your face off that you spent designing in character creation without having to worry about losing stats with an empty slot
---
Headware isn't without its uses tho, most masks and bandanas allow you to breathe in toxic environments, some prevent diseases from being underwater 
---
And some have lights on them so you don't have to use the gross green pip boy light :P
---
I have a feeling originally it was probably intended you could build but someone probably pointed out the issues allowing randoms to have that kind of access might cause so it got disabled.
---
Still going as of now! Working towards last winter outfit after unlocking skele suit
---
You can still earn the seasonal items, my guess is they will be removed in the update in about 12 hours from now tho 
---
But who knows, they may still be up after that
---
has alot more to do with people recognizing this is a worse deal than the previous challenge for atoms system. it removed alot of player agency with what they unlock for atoms. its a very transparent attempt to get more money without really having to produce anything new to earn it. the ghille skins are lazy and unfinished, and the captain cosmos stuff if CC content being resold to us. and people are focusing on the BP because there is nothing else new. no fresh content to put the season in the background where it is in most game.
---
bottom line, is that you could earn more cosmetics with the previous atoms system for less work, less FOMO and you would have more choice. its a worse deal and people are not "delusional" just because they dont circlejerk the idea of giving bethesda more money, or grinding endlessly.
---
adding more monetization is never going to revived with open arms, especially when they cannot be fucked to fix basic bugs and and basic QoL thats been requested for a year. if they want more money, they should earn it by putting out a better product.  ffs they cant even get the challenges for their season to work correctly.  they fuckin auto complete for people, a bug they said was fixed. its just sad at this point.
---
Right there with you buddy lol
---
Possible? Sure.  Ideal?  Not really... Mainly because those two builds live under different SPECIAL stats.  I guess if you max out strength and perception both you'd be okay but it's not leaving you much room for points elsewhere.
---
I think we know where they are coming from
---
The orange mushrooms are Firecaps. Those fuckers are hard to find considering they're so brightly colored.
---
Oof. Can you at least build together at a public workshop?
---
I don’t know if this will help or not but if I don’t get score I’ll server hop and compete a challenge and then I’ll usually get more score than the challenge I completed, like it’s catching up. It doesn’t help the auto complete but it’s worked for me a few times on score I didn’t get.
---
Seems its only use is for mele and that fails
---
Cool, thanks for the reply!
---
You know the sparkle eyes thing they make things do in animated movies? I’m doing that right now. This game had such a rocky start but it’s like a cherry tree, give it a bit of time and bam.
---
I've been grinding the Mire since 2018 hoping one day, that list at the end of a daily or event will end with "Tattered Field Jacket." Maybe some day I'll know how you feel, but until then I'm at least happy for you.
---
You didn’t mention getting rusty knuckles and the leg mod that increases carry weight. And you forgot to mention you don’t want to go into lucky hole when at least level 60 or if you are low level go with someone higher level than you probably level 60 or higher
---
Yes and the people who love NW are forced to spend more time playing Adventure because they have absolutely no way of earning Score besides 1 daily.
---
Its single daily. Usually takes less than 30 minutes (unless its the survive 30 minutes challenge).
---
I don't see why not, but you might be skimping on some useful charisma, endurance, or luck perks 
---
Depends on how much of your build you wanna commit to dps I suppose 
---
Some heavy weapons are good enough to still earn xp and loot drops from scorchbeast queen even without perks, if that's all you're worried about you'll be fine
---
I’m good at both so I don’t mind going to Morgantown but I vote for flatwoods so I’m not doing the same map every time and I only play when there’s new skins to unlock. Nuclear winter is already a rinse and repeat waste of time. I’d hate to make it even more redundant
---
Congrats you just selected a random word and attempted to base an argument off of that. I don't want the game to be easier I want the old way of making atoms or at least one that is less exploitative than the current system.
---
You're right, this game is abominably easy. So much so that I have played through the entirety  sans the Queen(because I refuse to get Fallout 1st) solo without using a single weapon. 
---
If you haven't done so then you don't have the right to tell me i like things easy.
---
Edit: Let me clarify, the new tasks are not *more difficult* than the old system. They are more time consuming and vital if you want something in particular towards the end of S.C.O.R.E meaning it taxes your time much more for people who have a life outside of this game
---
Bro can you give me bow plans my new acc is i think under 10 i want bowssss
---
Damn, looks like I'll be grinding like crazy on the double XP weekend. Hopefully they have some more simple NW challenges like placing CAMPS.

Level 99 and had no idea about the excavator bonuses. Wow. I most definitely will be trying this out soon.

If you’re on Xbox come to my

camp! I sell for 1 cap currently just to clear space!
---
I’m heavy gunner/melee. It works well. Heavy guns, melee, and shotgun are strength
---
Thank you. I hope the Bethesda Gods are good to you soon if you was PS4 I'd trade you mine
---
you can and its a question of the "good" definition.  
---
  
---
problem is, a lot of heavy perks are STR related while automatic rifles need PER. might be better to start another character and have one based on STR for heavy guny and melee, the other based on PER for (non)automatic rifles.  
---
you can do anything, nothing will stop you. but it wont be effective. on the other hand, its a game and you should have fun. if you just want to hear the great sound of a minigun or lever action, why not heading to morgantown airport and shoot scorched with a minigun on a STR 1 character.

Is your memory that bad? Do you not even realize you can scroll up? That bad huh
---
Now back on topic. What I said was not a logical fallacy, you’re mistaken. __Try re-examining your understanding of fallacies__.
---
Awesome! Take my poor man’s gold. 🏅
---
Yes lol. Unless it had a man bun too. Then I’m not sure?
---
Too bad? Casual players are getting less FREE premium currency that BGS was NEVER obligated to give you. 
---
I'm a casual. I wish they had removed all free atoms just so I could see all the "not entitled" whiners go into full blown meltdown mode. 
---
As it stands? I'll probably finish half the season. I'd love the fireplace door, but I just don't have the time to grind it out. Thats rough, but it's hardly a reason for outrage. 
---
And as for "getting less" are you sure about that. Compare how many free atoms you used to get vs the price for single items in the AS. You're looking at one or two items tops from free atoms per month. 
---
Under the new system? Cosmetics. Camp stuff. Other in game rewards.  You end up pulling in more under seasons.
---
lol at shillpost
---
Are you on xbox? That may have been me. I dropped 6 sets of X-01 at random camps for lower level players.
---
_¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
That’s not a transferable plan but you can have someone craft it for you
---
Well, the score is an adventure system. Maybe make one similar for people that want to play a battle royale? But don't mix things, they are different games
---
Save them for the next challenge for sure
---
Cry me a River. You lost the free premium currency they had no obligation to give you. 
---
Textbook entitlement
---
Get a fast firing Vampire weapon if you are going to tank pylons.
---
I just grinded out the beanie and the fur lined jacket over the last 4 days... I don’t feel so good...
---
Nothing, excess levels do not alter your stats/dps in any way.
---
It's the build, gear and consumable buffs that do.
---
True but I don't think the level 44 dude is an exploiter or else he would have just finished the whole board by now lol
---
Don’t blame me blame bethesda they trained me to be a cupboard searching looting frenzy, so if I see items sitting around I just can’t help myself.
---
I would like a more creative pvp mode. Nuclear winter feels like a lazy, last minute decision. Also, most people play fallout games for the immersive story not the pvp aspect. Feels like the lead team is out of touch with the fan base.
---
I thought that was just my game! Glad to see I’m not the only one with a slow cursor
---
That’s strange. If you completed all the dailies for today and yesterday you would have gotten 4K from that alone which would push you to rank 4 in the legendary run while being close to rank 5. This is excluding the weekly.
---
Did you list your character level or legendary run rank?
---
Nope. Sorry. 
---
Earn more cosmetics under the old system? You're delusional.
---
Not as of now! Just got the skele suit and grinding the winter one
---
I suppose the faster they get to rank 100, even if they get burnt out they'll be able to take a longer break from the game than most other players while the season still goes on lol
---
The only horrible behavior was your need to post this boring story on the internet.
---
Not paranoid at all. He is a nob. Your event, u do what u like.
---
When this hits game pass all the toxic kiddies from fortnite are coming in
---
I hate it when you people complain about those people complaining.
---
It’s a lot. 14k I think? Could be wrong. But I just got it after grinding for a few days.
---
Right, but if you can take as long as you like then whats the point of seasons? The time constraint of the season  and time off feel like the right balance to me and seems pretty in line with other games on the market.
---
Hahaha me too. It's getting my anxiety right up there everytime i see it lol
---
Super Duper also applies to smelting, so have it on when you're smelting the ore as well.
---
Edit: A couple of brief corrections: Ammosmith only adds up to 80% (if you have it ranked to 2) and Super Duper only doubles the base. It doesn't double the bonus you get from Ammosmith.
---
Because having a head slot item become best-in-slot would hurt Atom Store sales, especially if that item isn't reskinnable. That's the reason why Radicals Mask was removed rather than made a legacy item like everything else in the history of the game, but wrapped up in a nice "for the benefit of the players!" package. Gotta push those numbers up! Sell the funny hats!
---
I hate to ask an obvious question, but have you relogged and tried again?
---
Actually I misspoke because when I say exploiter I really mean abuser. An exploit like the swimtest would be way too inefficient for season XP. But there's a lot of stuff you can abuse to increase your Intelligence so you're getting insane amounts of XP. Double-stacking full Unyielding buffs for one, but they do still have to actually play the game
---
:In my best IT voice:
---
Have you tried reattaching a floor to it and removing it again
---
100 points into rank 25, haven't been going too hard on the farming and today was the first day I actually did the NW challenge, kinda kicking myself for not doing the others as some seemed rather easy and less time consuming, I've missed out on about 1500xp from not doing the nw dailies and thats exactly how far I am from rank 26, so I guess I'd be a little further, but I'm not too bothered.
---
I leave them the notes I pick up elsewhere. I particularly like passing out insult bot receipts.
---
I run a bloodied stealth commando build. But occasionally jump in power armor with bloodied faster fire rate/explosive heavy guns and still do amazing damage. The boost from adrenal reaction/bloody mess/nerd rage/bloodied weapon bonus do enough! Either way I absolutely melt and can solo the Queen/Imposter. If your bloodied you have alot more to work with.
---
It's not tho, it's a system for both game modes, the rewards you get from it can be used in both game modes aside from the ammo converter to my knowledge 
---
Plus whenever there is a NW only reward event, people make the same complaints
---
It really doesn't take that long to reach 10k XP if you pop some cranberry relish and go clear out the whitespring ghouls and maybe the Super Mutants at West Tek. Probably would be quicker doing that then earning today's NW daily
---
So I don't see why NW players should lose literally their only daily to grab some score
---
The restaurant where rose the robot is has a ton
---
No problem! I hope it helps, it doesn’t work every time and it could be completely unrelated that I sometimes get extra score doing that but every little bit helps. Good luck to you!
---
I just wasn’t sure because usually when there’s a sarcastic comment, it’s also funny. I try not to judge and don’t comment on posts that don’t matter to me. Are you easily triggered?
---
It's 14,000 exactly.

Scroll down on this page and you can see them all.
---
Agree, it works very well in Elder Scrolls Online (Bethesda...)
---
I have if u still need
---
There's tons of free acid to be had from corpses at the end of Glassed Caverns too
---
I left the world and rejoined, but just now left the game.
---
Big bend tunnel.  Pick up everything, kill everyone.  Theres benches at the beginning, middle, and end.  You'll get 3 or 4 hundred with perks.
---
*inner boomer voice*
---
I will try that.
---
Edit: Did that and now I can't remove the floor.
---
I played NW for the first time tonight. Hid in a bush and had to move once to adjust for the storm. In between moving I punched a Grafton monster that had just killed another player and then proceeded to hide again. Made it all the way to the final 2. My final hiding spot ended up being right on the edge of the storm and between a wall.
---
I do actually. Also turns put I have a level 45 handmade rifle without stock, but I see the stock and I honestly dont like them, so I'll just take a standard handmade no stock
---
Abuse is a strong word for that but I see what you mean, still doing that strat is keeping to the rules of the game, unlike exploiting which is abusing oversights imo
---
I'm not trying to tell ya how to perceive it tho, I'm just talking out loud lol
---
Think that’s bad? Tell that to my friend with a level 70+ fully specced out commando build. For the lols we got in PvP with my level 11 gunslinger. 
---
Literally two full clips missed me. I killed him just fine with my pipe bolt action.
---
You still get tons of rewards in this new system; probably more than you'd have gotten in the old one. The biggest change now is you just don't get a pick of what those rewards are; you lose out on choice. That point is one I can understand frustration with, to be sure. 
---
Business-wise, I think the new system is objectively pretty smart. It's hard to complain too much since we still get tons of stuff. In addition, they've basically monetized "choice", in that now you probably have to buy in via atoms if you want to get that other shiny, new outfit skin in the shop, but not on the board. They've also added a new low-cost buy-in option for people by allowing us to pay for board progression. Someone who never bought or used many atoms might be more tempted to get some to finish off the last place on their board for that last power armor skin. After all, it's only 150. 
---
Now, it's not a flawless system, to be sure.   
---
I personally just like getting a bunch of mixed stuff, so I'm basically happy (sans some tuning). I think there are others, like that, too. I can't blame anyone who mourns the loss of choice, though, either. That said, in terms  of business decisions, I definitely wouldn't describe them as "shooting themselves with poor decisions" with this.
---
Leaf branches? This is actually the next thing I've been saving up for, is it that bad?
---
Gotta love how when you miss with the fat man, the mini nuke just falls through the ground and disappears
---
No, probably not. The only high level reward that interests me is the fireplace
---
Yo if your on ps4 can i friend you ill give you suplies for it i really need friends and try tbe bow
---
You're not supposed to be able to stack Unyielding twice for each piece though so it's still a pretty big exploit. Been around for a long time. Some say the dataminers even know how to triple stack it but these are only legends
---
Glad I’m not the only one.  The quest was so easy but when I triggered the event and 12 100+ level players showed up I knew I f’ed up somehow.  I ran around like a chicken with it’s head cut off but managed to make it to the end.  Fast forward 100 levels and I am really lenient when I see a low level trigger the event and try and jump in if I can.
---
Well I dislike your complaint that I’m complaining about someone that’s complaining.
---
At least it is for sure going to be reworked! Hopefully with the next update
---
I'm not sure about other stuff, but I was disappointed when I couldn't use the ghillie wood armor in NW.
---
Sorry, you can get items in legendary run for NW?
---
All the time, no exceptions.
---
Idk there's a pretty big portion of the fallout fanbase that wants some kind of multiplayer experience with high risk and reward 
---
Plenty of people were upset that for the most part players both had to agree to initiate PvP, and even more upset when they found out the most you have to lose to another player is your junk 
---
I would like something like survival mode back, but a battle royale mode like NW at least gives a little bit of that high risk and reward gameplay, it just sadly has everything else I love about fallout stripped away
---
But creating a game mode that merges those two experiences together is tricky, I'm not sure how one would go about doing it, so this is the best we got so far atm I guess
---
Oh yeah! They stick out like a foot on each side of your head. If your not rocking the armor that has the vines and stuff too it looks absolutely stupid...but I'm wearing it bc hell I just spent a crap ton of gold on it so I might as well put some miles on it before I throw in in a display or something.
---
It was just a late night “supposed to be funny” post to go along with your smoking ideas. Hope you get your clean pre war ideas and good luck in the wasteland, see you out there.
---
Mix it up man. Change characters and work on a different build. There’s no reason to go past level 100 unless you have ego issues. Like I said, NW is a waste of time considering how much end game content you have to earn.
---
Get the Scrapper perk and scrap laser guns. Super mutants and Blood Eagles often carry them.
---
Yeah all the weapon skins and camp items can be built in NW I'm pretty sure 
---
For some reason the only things that don't work are the ghillie suit armor skins
---
Damn! I appreciate it, you saved me a wasted buy.
---
yes but i used an exp exploit
---
I no longer use my Gatling laser on legendary enemies. I can never find the ash pile afterwards.
---
Encryptid ain't free
---
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
---
Like I never made ends meet
---
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
---
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
---
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
---
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
---
Encryptid ain't free, I mean, baby
---
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
---
Ok that's good, I honestly didn't even really think about it until I thought about kiddos playing.
---
No problem
---
Oh I didn't know that. That's exciting!
---
Ohhh I had no idea that was a thing
---
Okay yea that is definately a grey area, I'm actually not sure how I feel about that yet haha, thanks for the info I had no clue
---
I tried that a few sadly it didn't work but getting kicked from server and rejoining off my team worked until I moved to different server. Just hope it fixes eventually.
---
Rank 20, but have playing my ass off. Really sick of the grind, and all the garbage legendaries that drop during the grind. Honestly, not had one drop worth keeping in days.
---
I only do it for the SCORE. I’ve had about 10 matches and only downed one player. As you start shooting someone they just start jumping and flailing in the air and one of their buddies then scopes you out for the kill. I get a lot farther by hiding. More often than not I am last one from my team left standing but it is probably do to the aqua boy card I have.
---
if you are just going to call everyone who doesnt agree with you delusional, perhaps you need to find a break from reddit. 
---
ive seen your responses, and i saw you being combative to every comment on another thread. its pretty clear that this is too much of a contentious subject for you to handle. acting like a petulant child isnt going to convince anyone of anything.
---
At this point it’s just semantics over the word “reasonable”. Personally I haven’t had that many issues at all which makes me think the problems are on your end and not the developers fault. Is your xbox running too hot? When was the last time you dusted it?
---
I think this is pretty reasonable quality content from my experience.
---
Did you give Horizon Zero Dawn a try? I thought they nailed it.
---
Depends if you haven't unlocked the Halloween, Xmas or Survival items yet. They are currently unlockable so those packs could help out quite a bit
---
I've soloed her as bloodied unyielding twice for low levels who spawned it alone and had no one show. I heal to half health, grab all 3 pylons while sneaking, hammer stimpacks and light her up with a FFR handmade. That usually triggers mutation and I die to a blind laser blast or the pylons, because she can't find me. Respawn, reload, repeat. She dies in 3 to 4 rounds of this. You generally die because the reload animation interrupts stimpack use.
---
Yesssssssssss
---
Yea I'm not sure why you can't honestly 
---
Buuut the ghillie skins are kinda broken even in the main game, so not using them in NW may be a bug 
---
Who knows, I hope that's the case anyway
---
I do not appreciate your dislike of my complaint of you complaining about those who are complaining.
---
Good idea!
---
Thank you and no worries. I’ll see you around
---
I dont use pistols. Is that range normal? Isn't that sniper kind of range?
---
I dust it every Monday. My WiFi is actually pretty good, I never have issues on any other game. And my Xbox doesn’t get hot, I’ve been keeping an eye on it just in case Fallout 76 makes it run harder than normal. It’s well ventilated and cool in my house.
---
This should be the top comment.
---
And if you do stick around to kill them, which uses up all your ammo and is damn near impossible, ESPECIALLY if there’s more than one, what loot do you get - USUALLY A SINGLE MIRELURK MEAT AND THAT’S IT! URGHGHGH!
---
Well over 100 in NW. Been playing it since launch. I have a tiny crew I roll with. Seen the best and worse days with tons of exploiters hackers etc (PC). But for SCORE I jump on get it done and get off. I don't like having to focus on challenges when playing the game mode.
---
I still believe NW is one of the most unique pvp, battle Royale style games out today. It's pace and strategy lend itself to some exciting battles.
---
It just work.
---
I got a bffr lever and it is pretty snappy but not BE  just wish it had better capacity but I  guess that's why I got the qe aswell  i guess
---
Counter proposal:
---
We set up a massive pvp fight area outside 76 and the second someone spawns out of the vault we start fighting each other(leaving them alone) while screaming battle cries in area chat and scare the shit out of them.
---
No problem!
---
300 points shy from rank 19
---
No idea. I never use pistols either. Hunting rifle default is like 120 or 130 according to my crappy medic's hunting rifle.
---
guilty as charged
---
I haven't gotten score from challenges, and sometimes I get it for no reason, maybe just a delay
---
So, if I understand what you're saying, only 10 points are necessary to have "full health"? Also, anything putting you over that amount, like a +E weapon is essentially a wasted stat?
---
I'm at 21 and tired as well. All I could muster today was all of the daily's and then just jumped off. Might go easy all week just doing the daily's so I have motivation to grind this weekend.
---
That’s hardly an excuse. All of us have played Fallout before. If I see loot bags, I don’t even check to see what’s in them unless there’s nobody around or I just killed the guy.
---
Farcry has it down pretty well.
---
Your unappreciation of my dislike of people complaining to people that complain about others complaining enrages me.
---
Id go for the strength card that reduces chem weight instead of armor weight, i forgot the name. Its a really good build tho
---
Maybe they Auto completed earlier when you were doing them
---
I'm just shy of 20 and couldn't put that wall paper up fast enough!
---
Haha but Rocksy is doing it all the time! It’s already in the game. They just need to put it on repeat as an emote. I don’t afk for long either. Sometimes I need to step away for a quick minute and would like to let people know
---
Shame about the predictable story, blurry graphics and over use of God rays in that game as the combat is pretty fun.
---
Same here. I tried it when it was released, went back to Adventure mode, then loaded into NW for the first time in nearly a year for the SCORE. 68 perk packs to open.
---
I've missed a 95% shot but one-shot killed an enemy with 0%
---
*just Bethesda things*
---
Actually showing xp need for next level would make me play at least couple hours a week.
---
Or just like...hide in a bush for two or three rounds? I dunno man, all the NW challenges have been more than easy. I’d rather sit in a bush and watch William Shatner get his uniform torn perfectly across the chest again on Netflix for thirty minutes than feel like I’m being forced to level up when I’d rather be doing something less grindy.
---
The score is awarded when you have done 3 of the 5 tasks. Apparently a bug.
---
I saw something posted that you should hit lvl 20 by the end of week one to be on track. Here's to hoping that's true, I'd love that secret door
---
Is that all the .ini changes you made? I'm trying to figure out a way to do it that doesn't change the graphics too much.
---
You're able to switch them on the fly you know OP. I play with my group and we stick with Building to get more XP from all sources, then I switch it to Hunting if a legendary pops up, and finally Events right before the event ends. If you mean you want people to Roleplay (example) but still get bonuses from another thing, then I would suggest talking to your group about what they actually want to do
---
Same spot as you, just barely got the wallpaper.  35 would be awesome after week 2 but kind of seems like a stretch.  Good luck and enjoy that wallpaper!
---
I think alot of us are feeling the fatigue! I only did my daily's today and then logged off.
---
This is what I do. I run primarily shotguns. But depending on what I'm doing or feel like... i can easily change to heavy, melee, or shotguns.  With minimal change of a few other perk cards, and still do great dmg... eventhough I'm not bloodied or junkies. Lol
---
Just kill the  [Whitespring sentry bot](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sentry_bot_(Fallout_76)#Whitespring_sentry_bot)s \^\^
---
What do you mean by nothing hanging over the sides? Like nothing placed on the outside walls?
---
The strength perk weapons are about the only way to do it. I have a bloodied character I can switch btw heavy, 2h melee and unarmed with a swap of a few perks. The versatility is awesome and there's plenty of room for the defensive perks I need for bloodied.
---
I just want the ranger helmet’s light to work. It modeled in. My actual cosplay helmet has two lights there *and* the visor lights up. Other headwear have lights.
---
I grab everything I can, especially weapons. I have 12K steel in my scrapbox from this, not including the few thousand I sold
---
Lol this happened to me today. There's a few other events that should do this as well.
---
Maybe this person just doesn't need the caps and wanted someone to get the plan for a good price. I don't charge much for anything I sell in my vending machine.
---
I just want the sink to allow me to collect as fast as from a river. I dont even care about the rads. But, unlimited purified water would be vendor breaking cuz you could get your full 1400caps in minutes, and then buy stuff and sell more water
---
Your prices are too high! I’m not paying 2 caps per bullet!
---
Same here... so close to 20
---
10 seasons lmao
---
Bugs that waste my time. 
---
Exploits that allow people to get everything I grind for in hours or less. 
---
Lack of bug fixes and continued introduction of new bugs.
---
Hey can I curse this asshole out? Please?
---
Yeah I remember my first trip to Nuka-World and saw three of them jumping towards me. I unloaded all of my action points on 1 and still didn't kill it and just watched it and it's 2 buddies getting closer and closer to me in slow motion. Makes me shudder just thinking about it.
---
Speaking of bugs I can’t stand that kid singing about bugs on the holotape in campfire tales...
---
The Warframe one is really easy to get through and makes this one look terrible.
---
This game has no right to ask for any type of currency other than the 60$ it costs, it still broken and old bugs keep creeping up while the content was on life support until Wastelanders came up.
---
Being disconnected in NW when you are in top 10 is what annoys me most.
---
People with mics on that wheeze, cough, playing some brain dead music and talk like some demented person. (This forced me to turn mics off permanently.)
---
Last is people who go through your camp to turn off everything and sometimes lure scorch beasts over to destroy your buildings while your not there.
---
Did you try the same process for attaching stairs and removing them also make sure you dont have any metals stairs going into the ground. That happened to me before
---
Or you could get out of your comfort zone a little. Hundreds of hours only playing on 2Fort isn’t a fun time at all.
---
Check the math, this "new system" is one more attempt to get people *buying* atom with real money. A large portion of the community playing this **can't** get through a large portion of this with out being pushed into spending real money; on a game we all had to buy in the first place.
---
Doesn't help the first 1/4 of the rewards are incredibly dull and or just down right terrible. Wood Guile armor, yes that's just the cosmetic we all dreamed about....
---
What is this, a suit of power armor for ants?  How can we be expected to teach soldiers to learn how to shoot good if they can't even fit inside the armor? I don't wanna hear your excuses! The armor has to be at least... three times bigger than this!
---
Oh so that must be what happened. I had/have stairs going into the ground.
---
\^ this
---
17. I missed one day and haven’t done the revive with stims in NW or today’s survive for 30 minutes. Just didn’t have the time for them, and without some good new content I really don’t want to play just to level up.
---
Oh thank you for that! :)
---
Im working from home from thursday... hope they dont fix it before then lol
---
Did you try something and then untry it?
---
Yeah, that’s what I was getting at when I said “typically”. It’s certainly possible, I just don’t think it’s true. I don’t see any reason to assume this key aspect of FEV would be any different for this strain, and every other super mutant in is a genderless monster just as you’d expect (no offence, Grahm), who yell like ogres just like the super mutants we’re used to from the other games.
---
This. I do this all the time. Can repeat with server hopping; and with 7+ kills can reap 45+ acid every time.
---
Bugs of all kind!
---
You do get points every 10,000 experience, no matter where you earn the experience from.
---
I think I got points when I was cooking once, though I wasn't paying all that much attention.
---
I expected to see u cry on level up in NW
---
You’re getting downvoted by people because you come across as arrogant and condescending. Your replies to people are basically saying “ they’re thick, they need to google things, and you’re right” what kind of response do you expect to get with a reply like that?
---
"The Quantum Chord" is a good name for it
---
The first day of Fasnacht, when it broke, I did the only event that day and got a Jester mask. I struck while the iron was hot and traded that Jester mask for a fixer plan. Either it was a duped plan and he didn't care or had no clue. 
---
Fast forward to the Mystery Pick. I only do it once and get a 3* Mutant's Fixer. I'm a full health Stealth Commando with 7 mutations and that thing shreds through lvl 68 mutants and ghouls in three headshots. No need for bloodied builds.
---
Make sure you have the scrapper perk when you scrap weapons. Before you know it you'll have a few thousand!
---
Your enragement of my unappreciation towards your dislike of my complaint of you complaining about other’s complaints gives me irritable bowel movements.
---
I shit you not I went ingame after posting that, completed Idle Explosives, and had one drop. I'm tempted to buy you a lottery ticket along with one for myself.
---
Happy cake day! Yeah I semi geeked over this wallpaper when I saw the leaks. I like it better than the other one we get later with the planets. I would probably be rightfully where you are score wise but I didnt do the first 2 days NW challenges.
---
I tried many things and untried them.
---
Not really a solution, but I remember something about being able to delete a certain steam file so it forces the game to let you log in manually, I just don't remember what the file was, or anything more specific tbh. Hopefully someone who remembers can point you in the right direction.  
---
\*EDIT\* Maybe it was changing or deleting a line referring to steam in the ini.
---
I was playing the other day in a scorched earth event, had to log out to do real life things. When I logged back in a few hours later, I loaded into another scorched earth event already in progress, when I loaded in the game said I had 0 ammo for my equipped gun, and I couldn’t switch to any other guns because the game hadn’t finished loading my character info yet and thought I was a level 1. So I’m slowly walking  around taking damage from enemies that I can’t shoot.
---
100 levels is fine, we are in the 1st week and they already have a scheduled double score weekend and I wouldn’t be surprised is towards the end of the 10 weeks they do a triple score event so people could catch up, it’s really not that bad.
---
New Years suits
---
Thanks I'll look into it!
---
Congrats!
---
Except magic gauss shotguns. You have to use VATS and they will fucking snipe an enemy across the map with a 3% chance to hit.
---
Ya go for it ya big weeb.
---
Sometimes when you place a workbench or object it can clip or hang over the edge of a foundation/floor, this can break the blueprint in certain scenarios.
---
Dude I think your keys are messed up.
---
No its just phat fingers lol
---
I’m a knitter, so I work on my projects in between matches and if I’m in a safe enough bush. NW is how I get XP for working on my projects lol
---
Taking one for the team is actually good with public team system, I hope it will be keep, I personally love what Rad as a Junkie PA user
---
fair counterpoint, truly the game needs more sexy giant green ambiguously female super mutants for its lore to be watertight
---
I was about to ask about the interesting accent.
---
Some of the challenges are also rewarding score before they're actually complete, for example the robots weekly gave me score at 3/5
---
I don't have much experience with passes overall, especially any that are entirely free. I do know that with Smite it has a couple of rewards for the free track and it isn't that hard to finish the pass. Spend maybe like an hour a day (I try for an arena, joust, and assault) and you'll be pretty much set. If you pay for the other track you can get skins, gems (premium currency), and extra XP for the pass. But you get XP for it just be playing instead of "get XP whenever you get x amount of Worshippers".
---
I also play The Division 2 which has a free and premium track. You get a lot more from the premium but get no extra XP for purchasing. You level up your pass by getting XP in the game, regardless of source. Every couple of weeks there is a target to track down and kill. For the entire week the target is first available there is double XP. I'm a little over level 60 out of 100 and there are still I think 10 weeks left. I did play a lot for 3 or 4 days since I just got the expansion. They add challenges that give extra XP which is nice.
---
I missed 2 or 3 days for Seasons and it makes me have no desire to worry about doing any of the challenges since if I get on I just want to do quests or whatever I feel like for a bit and not have to try to maximize my XP gains to make up for missed challenges. I'm a little over 100 and have all of the perks I want. I don't need more levels to play the game the way I want to but if I care about the season rewards I can't do that. Being "dedicated" and playing every day to get all rewards since there is no paid pass is one way to look at it. If I wanted to spend 2 or 3 days and do nothing but grind it out I should be able to just by playing.

In Smite you can just play matches of any mode as any God and get exp. In The Division 2 you can do literally any activity and get exp. In Fallout 76 you have to remember to do all of your daily and weekly challenges as well as making sure to level up (I think every day has a level up challenge so if you do all challenges that isn't any issue). I believe it was somewhere about 86 levels over the course of the season to hit max level in addition to doing all challenges. These 86 are a part of the "level up" daily challenge. I find it kind of funny that people have no issues with leveling up being part of challenges and finishing the pass while also saying that double exp isn't great because they have nothing to spend their level ups on. Every 100 score you miss from a challenge is another level you need to get.

---
I just checked and I think you change the line in the fallout76.ini
---
under \[General\]
---
bSteamEnabled = 1 change it to read bSteamEnabled = 0
---
I rarely see encrypted pop when I’m playing. If it does, you bet I’ll be there. I don’t much plan to take the girls towers, but I’m ready to stimpak you back to life as much as you need. Or twenty times, whichever comes first. 
---
After 20, site I’ll grab the towers if you need. It’s not my favorite thing to do since I am bloodied. So I’ll just heal up and switch to commando.
---
Traveling Pharmacy, and I agree. 
---
I'd switch out strong back and get 3\* blocker as well, you take 45% less melee damage.  I'd probably switch out marathoner for sneak too, since you are using covert operative. And Adrenaline is broken right now, so might want to use something else until it gets fixed.
---
How do you check when the reset happens in your timezone? I'm PST.
---
it was a harpoon
---
Yay!!! I'm happy for you! What a lucky day on fallout we've both had 😊😊😊
---
:( I hope it drops for you soon 🤞🏼
---
Every single comment arguing with you and stating that crickets are squishy as anything else, is someone running a bloodied build with no fucking clue about how the game plays outside of the ridiculously OP meta. And god forbid we nerf that meta and make the game more playable among all classes, those little tiny children will threaten to quit the game if you take away their precious OP build.
---
prob instigating, unless you wanna just run low health and go bloodied.
---
Panic over. Thought you got that instead of missiles, but I can see they are there...!
---
Congrats :)
---
Yeah, it was really bad yesterday.   Four 95 percent point blank shots and not a hit.  Obviously VATS percentage can't be trusted.
---
How did u find the damage they put out
---
The regular marine helmet is sadly not on the Xbox and only pc
---
You make a really really good but shitty point
---
That range is huge. My modded handmade only does just under 200
---
Thanks, and same to you. I think 35 might be doable. To get to 20 it was a gradual 50% increase, plus I missed 500 points from two NW challenges, so I figure if the score gains from all of week 2s challenges are the same I should be able to hit 32 to 35, especially if I play more and get the repeatable. I also haven't been using the lunchboxes or canned stew or other xp buffs as much as I should.
---
Glad you figured it out. It's hard to see the stairs going into the ground cuz it blends in with plants easy
---
I hear ya. I don’t run a bloodied or junkie build at all. I’m a level 112. I use my 2 shot .50 cal and I also have a handmade. Between those two weapons I do just fine. I was just stating how ridiculously OP the crickets are. Even at my level they’re OP. It’s easier for me to take down a 1 starred legendary scorched beast than it is to just melt a cricket.

"Atoms can be used to progress though the battle pass" that should be enough of an answer for you.
---
I agree I run heavy/power armor but the guy I always play with is sneaky sniper. I join in but with the mix of SPECIAL I am only so so on sniper rifles
---
The only cure is listening to it on a loop. One More Pils is your life now.
---
EXACTLY!
---
Everybody thinks she's Tiny Tina, but she's really just Sally if she were a little raider child, down to crawling through vents and occasionally dropping helpful stuff through those vents
---
Troubleshooters is where its at
---
It's got to the point one of us will stay on the terminal until we get the thumbs up to start lol
---
NW is pretty boring to me. Wish they didn’t make it part of the daily challenge.
---
Haha, same.
---
I run a bloodied build but if I play, or more likely start the event I will de-rad and tank the pylons. I like when I get all three so I know when to look for the blue been of light. He can wander pretty far off and so long as I get one shot in I'm good.  It's not that hard to set aside you bloodied build to tank those events.
---
Yeah.. I think my base is like 8 lmao
---
Good for you for not taking their crap.
---
There's a lot of jerks out there that order people around like you work for them.  Those people need to move out of their mom's basement and see hot the real world works.
---
yeah, I found it too. Bizarre.
---
Yeah, i have a TRO E Combat Rifle called "Silo Slayer" lol, it's great for Encryptid too obviously lol
---
Yes this. But be aware that the manufacture unit requires 100 power
---
19.5 right now. Not sure if that's good or bad tbh lol
---
Ok, ngl that sounds pretty funny.
---
and your first reaction was to start taking photos
---
smh
---
Speak for yourself, plenty of people like to play NW based on my own experience with all the people I’ve met.  I’ve never wanted to play that cartoony looking fortnite kiddie game but I can play NW anytime, enjoy it and do.
---
OP - Should us NW players start posting how much we could care less for adventure mode?  Nah, we don’t need to as we can kill each other for endless fun gameplay giving us an outlet to not get so bent out of shape; I see your conundrum now.
---
As someone else stated.. it helps to have the 3 picklock perks n the 3 hacker perk cards.  You can bypass a few areas with picklock. And there is terminals you can hack, which will turn the turrets against the robots.  When most or all robots are dead,  deactivate turrets.
---
Oh YEAAH!
---
My internet was out for the entire first week :( I’m hoping I can catch up a bit but I only have about an hour or so each day to play. I think I just hit level 10. Sigh.
---
You have to get another song stuck in your head.  It is the only way.
---
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you got on....
---
I need my 300 blood packs, 900 stims, and 200 purified water though. 😂
---
You can buy the backpack mod that reduces chem weight by 90% if you side with the raiders.
---
And the funny thing is that before anyone spawns we would probably all be just chit chatting and swapping weapons, armor and plans lol we just go from "oh I love that power armor skin you hav-shit someone spawned- SPARTAAAAAAA!" :cue dozens of weapons and explosions going off:
---
Every 100 score you miss from a challenge is one more level you need to get to make up for it. When you have all of the perks you need then you have no need to level up. So at that point you're literally grinding out levels and making sure to maximize your exp gain just to gain score because you didn't want to or couldn't log in every day to make progress. It wouldn't be as bad if you at least got some score for finishing quests or something. I feel like the current system should the bare minimum for finishing all levels but by doing other things in the game besides leveling for another 100 score you earn more so you don't have to log in every day. The only time you can really afford to miss a day is if you level enough to negate an entire day's worth of challenges.
---
Seasons as a concept is great. Having more options of progressing is nice. If I decided to take a day where I have nothing to do and just want to grind out my season level then I have to hope I can find the right armor pieces and change my build in order to maximize my exp so I can grind West Tek and other places for hours. Or I can take that day and do quests that I would much rather do. Being able to combine both options should be something everyone wants.
---
The one poor robot with no manikin makes me sad
---
it was a plan from the treasure hunter event. pretty sure you guys have it.
---
[This is the only song that can cure me](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
Why not? There's no in-world way to change your appearance like there was in previous games.
---
It was? I didn't know that, but i play on pc
---
It's literally in the pause menu tho
---
They sell pretty well at 600
---
I still believe 76 has one of the best communities in game especially for beginners. It only gets toxic at the end game where people are min maxing and exploiting stuff.
---
I can't even begin comparing being a newbie here and say GTA Online or Red Dead Online. It's like night and day.
---
That’s not in-game ...
---
Now that's a song I wouldn't mind hearing on Fallout radio.
---
Seems pointless and inconvenient at this point to add that and remove the current system
---
You def need a hand at first.
---
I use a TS FFR and it freezes the queen in 2/3 of a clip.
---
Well, that sounds terrifying.  Kinda glad I'm on PS4.
---
doesnt mean that it cant be added to the auto doc, it would just route you to the change appearance menu, but in a slight more immersive way.
---
You took me out of it. 
---
"A weeb is a derisive term for a non-Japanese person who is so obsessed with Japanese culture that they wish they were actually Japanese." 
---
The internet people don't even make sense anymore.
---
Who said anything about removing the current system?
---
I only said it would be nice to have a lore-friendly option in-game.
---
Actually, you would do better if you shoot sheepsquatch torso than head, protoctons and assaultrons got shitload of damage reduction on thier heads.
---
TORSO IS THE WAY TO GO.
---
 *Please assume the position*.
---
Where is it after you earn it? Do you have to craft it like items from the atom shop? (I haven't earned it yet so I'm just asking in advance)
---
I have my camp on the bridge just beside to the south of Gorge Junkyard by Morgantown/vault. Around that area and the area down the river has them. Also has a bunch of snaptails so all you need to do is go to flatwoods for bloodleaf. Worth taking a session to figure them all out, then whenever you need disease cures you can net like 10 per run. And that lasts a while on its own. Good pickings to ya.
---
What do you mean by “Invested your card”?
---
A decent way to get Lead/steel scrap before this point is by going to Eastern Regional Penitentiary. In addition to all the lead pickups in the yard/prison, there are about 12 can chime traps that can be picked up. Three in the yard (two in a hole in the west side of the wall and one hanging in a one of the three trailers in the south western corner of the yard. Two in Solitary by the minigun spawn on the first floor. Six in A block, all on the first floor). By world hopping, you can make upwards of 80 lead and 160 steel if they are all spawned in, not including the super mutant and feral ghoul loot if you kill them. Normally i do this while also grinding the Prison Duty Event that can spawn when approaching the prison. Since the cans provide 1 lead and 2 steel scrap, acid isn't required like it is to smelt lead ore from Lucky Hole and you can instead use that acid to craft gunpowder.
---
Also, at level 20 vender bot phenoix, BoS vendor found in Watoga, sells the Gatling Gun plan for around 3k caps. Since you can craft 5mm per craft, its extremely cost effective and the Gatling does good per shot damage but sadly lacks range unless the long barrel (learned by scrapping Gatling Guns) is attached. You can use this to make it to level 50 and work on stocking ammo of your preferred type for when you want to switch to something better. Alternatively, you can buy the .50 reciever for the Hunting rifle and use that but i find the Gatling Gun works better as an all rounder.
---
Nothing matters balance wise until frog legs is removed from perks
---
Nothing terribly lore friendly about getting major facial surgery in the wasteland with a machine with no recovery time.
---
Never change, it's funny!
---
Your irritable bowel movements brings me great pleasure of your complaint against my enragement I had with your inappreciative dislike of those who complain about others that are complaining.
---
Edit : Damn I messed up... you win this round sygnifax.
---
I have my full set of troubleshooters armour that i collected for silos and other roboty events, it reduces them from screaming death machines to tickle bots
---
what kind of take is this? Ego issues? People actually have fun playing the mode.
---
Take a power station workshop. Don't do the mission to restore power, just set up a fusion generator of your own and connect it. Free fusion cores.
---
You have to complete the entire Wastelanders questline, that includes siding with raiders or settlers and doing the vault 79 raid. No vault 79 raid = no bullion, no bullion = no treasury notes.
---
None anymore. There was a raid feature a while back, but it had so many issues they pulled it from the game for now.
---
Randos can still start the recall even if you're on the terminal. It's happened to me several times.
---
I took this pic pre-desk but I think you’ll like it
---
[Ward you slut](https://imgur.com/a/vZr1YsP)
---
I do this too and it makes a big difference. I also only do a few every day. For some reason I keep getting vanguard on Tuesday’s with my shotgun build
---
You don't need to bother with the Wayward.
---
You only need to do the main quest line with Crater or Foundation. Then you get treasury Notes
---
Bush wookie is definitely the way to go.
---
The mannequins are definitely a random spawn, I find them all the time, those robots, I think always spawn there, could the placement be coincidence or is it intentional?
---
Visit the Overseer at her home in Sutton.  That will kick it off.
---
If you're on PS4 let me know I do all pylons and am a team mefic with over 6k stimpacks
---
To be fair 95% chance doesn’t mean 100%. There’s a small chance to miss. Most games fudge the percentage in favor of the player. XCom and FO76 do not.
---
21
---
I mean, other games have it ... there are surgeons in FO4 in Diamond City and FO3 in River City, and in Fallout New Vegas there is _literally_ an Auto-Doc that does facial reconstruction exactly as being suggested.
---
It’s not just lore-friendly, _it’s in the lore already_.
---
Funny. I made a post about this (randos starting the recall) a few months ago and it got downvoted all to fuck. Every comment was defending the event stealers. "Well, it's a public event so anybody can do anything. Don't like it? Do it on your private server."
---
I swear, this sub is bipolar and cancer.
---
Fast travel bug makes me want to hulk smash my console 🤬
---
Can you tell me how to do it
---
Gt: dr teeth 69r md.     I'm on now
---
The sink is so slow.. I wish it was x5 water
---
Already in FNV there is an Auto-Doc that performs facial reconstructive surgery.
---
Some people think the progression of seasons if fine because "if you want to get all the rewards you have to be dedicated and work for it". It's cosmetics. Would it be so bad for people to be able to grind it out in a couple of days? I think the current system should be the minimum required to complete it. There should be more ways to earn score while playing instead of just leveling up. Like completing quests (maybe after you reach level 5 or 10 or something) gets you some score. Making x amount of caps (via vendors or players) gains you some exp. Killing x amount of enemies can get you score. Gathering plants, ore, or materials can get you score. More options isn't bad. I missed 2 or 3 days for seasons since I wanted to play other things and I can't be bothered trying to finished at all now because that's a lot of levels I need to get (and change my build to maximize exp gains) while I already have all of the perks I want.
---
Only reason I even play NW.  At least it's usually over quickly.
---
I know that.  But there are jerks out there that will buy items out of a vending machine just to sell to a vendor bot despite the low price being clearly aimed at newer characters.
---
I honestly think junkies would be best for leveling
---
Bloodied builds arnt OP, they’re glass cannons and should do glass cannon things
---
Eh. There are no shotgun perks to really make shotguns feel fun
---
Anyone have any good plastic locations?
---
What about some of the less traditional ammo types, such as arrows, fusion cells and explosive ammo (yes, I know explosives and archers aren’t the best builds, but as a hypothetical)?
---
Can you read? Seems not. In previous answer i said, its okay to not get 100 without farming. Logging for dailys taking 30 min max, its not * hard work*. Hard grind was in every mmo to date, you either go hard or you dont (i will not), but then dont complain about not getting max reward, max rewards are shit anyway. Todays players thinking that Mr Todd forcing them to log daily, dont do it if you dont like it
---
I dunno how much that would help. I more often find empty stores that are powered. Hell I turn the power of to my empty store and people still keep checking them.
---
3 hits not registering
---
2 people sneaking and trying to glitch the vending machine
---
1 pay to travel, I think is some Uber getting us arround lol
---
Are you still looking for one? Could craft you one when im online in a couple of hours
---
I just leave my purifiers unlocked, but water fountains would be a great addition and make going out of your way when you see a faint CAMP appear on your compass to top of your thirst less of a crap shoot as to whether or not the person locks their purifiers.
---
Hell, go all out and give a +5% XP buff for drinking from a water fountain at someone else's CAMP and a +1% XP buff up to +5% if someone drinks out of yours, everyone would be plotting routes to hit as many CAMPs as possible because they know most CAMPs will have them with big arrows and signs pointing them out.
---
This would be nice. Not everyone can play one game 24/7.
---
No, legs. Both the real sheepsqatch and the imposter an all assaultrons are vulnerable on their legs.
---
500 with Carnivore + Strange in Numbers
---
Fixed it, thanks for the pointer.
---
yeah it was one of the rare plans you could get
---
Didn't notice the difference between legs and torso, but head is the last spot where you want to short.
---
I love the event. What system are you on?
---
The enemies? It's on the wiki.
---
What ever out puts the most damage. Not the answer your expecting but weapons get useless extremely fast when leveling
---
I rock a full set of the new one I forget the model of. T65?
---
Oh damn didnt know that, still a bit of a noob at this game, thanks for the tip. Where can u get that mod for the backpack?
---
You should seek mental health help if a score system get you depressed
---
I don't see it on there I'll look again
---
Hah, I have the same problem. That damned robot likes me for some reason. However... if you’re on PS4, would love to see which she fancies more. :)
---
In the fallout76.ini located in documents\\my games\\fallout 76 find these lines
---
iSize W
---
iSize H
---
bFull Screen
---
bBorderless
---
Set them to the following for fullscreen 1080p, or change accordingly for your screen type and  whether you want borderless window or not.
---
iSize W = 1920
---
iSize H = 1080
---
bFull Screen = 1
---
bBorderless = 0
---
Once done, save the ini and then right click it and go to properties, set it to read only.
---
I don’t want the sheepsquatch plushie... I NEED it!!!!
---
That's better than coming across the guy getting spanked in FO4! HA HA. Where was this?
---
I had no idea this was possible until my wife searched google and found out about it. I was so proud she became a farmer with me lol. We ended up server hopping for a while and most times we found 5-8 cave crickets and yielded 35-50 waste acid every time. 400+ in less than an hour.
---
I got to rank 100 this way to be honest. You need around 10 kills just to match the xp of being in the last 10 alive.
---
Well i did pay like 60 bucks. So you know. I sure hope it will have a couple of years in it
---
Damn you must be grinding like crazy, have you gotten the sheepsquatch plushie? I’m not sure which level it is but I want to know how big it is
---
Yes they do, and if they bring them back good chances it’ll be on sale !!
---
Okay okay, seems like you just prefer to play gimped character, to suffer, some kind of masochism
---
You bought fallout 76 for the... Battle royal mode?
---
That was a terrible decision lol.
---
Yeah they usually come back cheaper, so don't stress, hold onto your atoms and wait, could be weeks, could be months, but it should be back. What was the item, out of curiosity?
---
That is great news. Thank you!
---
I was kicking myself.
---
they definitely knew
---
problem is blooided builds are not glass cannons, especially heavy gun bloodied builds that use power armor. You pretty much can't die if you build your character properly aside from not reacting fast enough to posion. even out of power armor bloodied builds can be tanks.
---
Suggestion, rename your hazmat suit “AaA HazmatSuit”, or whatever it takes to make it appear top of the list.  If you spawn in the nuke zone you have about 10 seconds grace period.  That’s enough to get into your pipboy and find the hazmat suit at the top.  
---
Also works to fast travel to the bunker.  Problem with this, sometimes it’s covered in other players and I can’t high light it while in a panic...or I’m suddenly overencumbered.
---
And all the mushrooms.
---
i just got what i want from that event, the fixer plan. already have all outfits. but i still join when players are joining. it's actually fun running around, then die instantly. i have a lot of stims because of those faction daily quest. i even sell most of the stims. it's one of the carry weight sucker, so make sure you have the perks.
---
You're forgetting that S.C.O.R.E. has also replaced the free Atoms we'd normally be earning.
---
I don't believe a mixed set would put you any higher. The best 2 normal sets are t51b and ultracite. And the best in terms of defence if the t65, though its really a tiny difference. And the best, and only, offensive pa is the sh. Though again it's bounse is tiny
---
Yea it hasn't given me anything else, I shoulda unlocked the halloween cobat armor paint but it hasn't popped up. I was manually keeping track of my exp after I got the combat rifle skin and went past what it shoulda unlocked at . :(
---
The neon letter lights.
---
It was between those and the scraptron. I chose function over form. Should have realized the scraptron is there to stay.
---
Finally got the last one, for reference I'm half way to rank 26. I started doing these at rank 0 ...
---
ALTERNATIVE METHOD- also gives steel for other ammo types.
---
Go to camden park, run under the roller coaster and disarm the can traps for 36 cans. Server hop and repeat. Gives lead and steel, and you dont have to worry about spending thousands of acid
---
Don't think nuclear winter is much of a priority due to the overwhelming amount of the fan base being disinterested in PvP. Especially Battle Royals.
---
I'd say instigating. When leveling you won't have a true build yet. And most things you're fighting should be dieing in 1 hit, you're not up against the Queen or anything
---
It's at the Crater. You need to be at least friendly with the raiders, then you can buy it off of Mortimer for 350 gold bullions.
---
Actually pretty fun all things considering. Ended up playing a few rounds when I was in last time.
---
Power armor trade off is not having legendary effects which is a pretty big drop off imo full unyielding secret service &gt; power armor for me
---
I've won 2 matches without killing a soul. In the top 10 85% of the time. Over half the time I'm in the top 10 I make it to the top 5, and often come in second. I love that Bush life (since I hate the mode lol)
---
For Smite you can finish the pass playing casually without purchasing the premium track (which gives bonus XP and cosmetics) with at least 2 weeks left. The challenges are also really easy to complete and not necessary. The only thing you would have to go out of your way for us doing emotes, playing as a certain class, or playing a certain mode.
---
In The Division 2 purchasing the pass gives no extra exp but you gain progress by literally doing anything. I played a lot for 3 or 4 days since I had just gotten the expansion. I'm a little over 60 out of 100 with 10 weeks left. So I can easily stop playing for 8 weeks and still be able to finish the pass. And there are 4 or 5 weeks out of the pass where there is double exp. So I'm pretty sure if you just run a mission on Challenging you gain a level (difficulties are normal, hard, challenging, heroic, and legendary). That's just playing without doing any of the daily or weekly challenges.
---
So yes, it is true. Two passes right there where you can get all of the rewards for doing no challenges (though Smite would probably be pretty grindy that way).
---
Yup.  Even worse point blank with a shotgun that would be literally impossible to miss without VATS but doing 0 damage 6 times in a row on a 95% to hit.  And I'll hit 100% of the time on long range 15% hit chances.  It's so messed up it's a joke.
---
Good for you. I personally don’t enjoy putting hours into a battle royal mode and have nothing to show for it. Once you reach level 100 on NW there’s no more rewards. Most people I know that are past 100 refuse to start on a different character because they believe having a higher level matters.
---
The only 2 I'd be interested in are what rads and taking one for the team. The sneak damage on could be good as well if I ran sneak lol
---
Because there is literally nothing else to do besides kill SBQ over and over and over.
---
South of Rollins wotk camp if I remember correctly (I was in the middle of a 3 way battle with mr handys / supermutants / and some vertibots when I found it). It was on a main road in that general area for sure.
---
There are events that reward SCORE? What are they?
---
Damnit every time that quest shows up I’m always the one who hooks up to all the pylons. I don’t even have power armor and there’s a whole bunch of idiots with their Gatling plasmas and x-01 power armor waiting for me to hook up to all the converters and burn through what like 75 diluted stimpaks while they just shoot anything that nears them, and the worst part is is that in all the times I have done the event, it has never been completed. And then there’s the guy who is level 300 when your only level 53 who killed me and took all my stuff the moment it ended. Like I want the sheepsquatch imposter suit, but the toxicity and stimpak waste is just not worth it. Sorry, I had to get that off my chest.
---
Awesome! I'll wander around there and see if I can find it!
---
I tried scrapping the Communist Collectron (first issue) and replacing it with the Fasnacht one and it locks fine now. Might be based on whatever is currently placed.
---
I also am curious
---
I'm in bed m8,
---
Nooo, you can’t just not like like them.
---
Haha Fatman go boom
---
I mean you were arguing that bloodied was a glass cannon, and if you are a heavy gunner not worried about levels unyielding doesn't really do much for you, don't really need any legendary effects when you have 42% dmg reduction and emergency protocols. You are a legit walking tank.
---
I am on Xbox, if your still online and have some for sell I'd love to pop over.
---
This was helpful and also further confuses me. If I follow the Fallout 4 formula then I should always kill every ghoul with 1 shot and never kill a super mutant with 1 shot unless I hit every pellet, but testing proved this false, unless I'm calculating it wrong.
---
It’s always raw. Those fluids drop randomly from irradiated creatures
---
Oh you bastard.
---
Oh sorry, I've never seen the film. Probably one of the few people in the UK who hasn't ..... colour me stupid
---
I lost quite a bit of satisfaction with the game not being able to simply kill Ra Ra and tell Gail she ran off because she hated Gail.
---
It didn't help that I had to run that stupid quest 4 times because of bugs and one time I lost my junk because it crashed right before I killed the final bot.
---
It also didn't help that my shotgun would break after about 10 mobs because I assume hardened receiver or something is bugged and it's doing 10x the durability loss it should be and it's never going to be fixed because it's worthless trash Bethesda.
---
I sell mine for 250 caps i havent had any clean me out in months i miss those days if some1 wants to buy a bunch from me and sit on them for months to unload to a vendor they can go ahead i cant make 5k in 5 secs sellin to a vendor unless i have 5 characters which is too much effort
---
Animation errors and clipping
---
Those crappy pink/purple looking ones? One of my most regrettable purchases. The "Signs and letters" plan that you can buy from vendors ingame is way better. I guess what I'm getting at is, you aren't really missing out.
---
I always pick up a few just by doing the scorched earth event.
---
Happy to help you! I will be on in about a hour, my ign is blueberrisundae
---
Have to take the gear and perk cards you need there’s always a trade off
---
Currently alot of the perk cards are fucked, and also with the rubber banding of health bars it seems like ur doing little damage to anything
---
I’m pretty sure there is still a wall glitch you can hose to launch a nuke in like 10 mins
---
Yes.
---
Nah you get more. With the old system you'd get ~6k atoms in the same time or at least that's what I've seen quoted for it. With this, you get 2k atoms plus a bunch of cosmetics.  
---
If you valued that stuff as what it'd cost in the shop that's 1500 for the armours, 1800 for the captain cosmos/dark matter power armours, 1-1.4k for the power armour paints etc. That's already more value than the old system and there's still plenty more in there.  
---
Of course the caveat with it is that you don't get to choose what you want to spend it all on which can make some of it worthless to you. The raw value of it all is still much higher though.
---
Did the same yesterday and today. I'm burnt out on 76.
---
Funny enough chimera squad percentages are pretty accurate. So it's worse than X-com.
---
I'm not seeing what your point is? why would someone start a new character, they can just change up their special points in adventure to try new builds, especially since they would have all the perks available being they are a high level. People do play games to have fun not just for the rewards.
---
You're not paranoid, that's toxic.
---
I'm at around 140 weight is it still too much? And i don't have any warnings about that
---
Bloodied weapons and Unyielding armor, best way to level.
---
Currently sitting at rank 1
---
Several weeks left to hit that rank ammo converter milestone from what I hear 🤣
---
After that, I’m out
---
I AFKed my way to the gillie suit.  Now I'm doing the same for SCORE.
---
The few times I tried to play it was several minutes of waiting for the match to start and then 15 minutes of running around looking for someone to shoot.
---
So AFKing in a bush and playing are pretty much the same thing.
---
Circle needs to start 2 contractions in.  Unless you get 300 people for the match, it's too damn big.
---
You're complaining that they designed the legendary run to be completed by the bulk of the playerbase? If I am understanding you right, are you out of your gourd? I'm tired of all these battle passes that are a pain and a half to conplete. I say give us something that we are expected to be able to finish.
---
I have a bloodied and a quad cryolator.  Both are awesome against SBQ.   Get your 1000 damage with something else and then freeze that pig for everyone else!
---
The music on the pip boy?
---
Fallout 3 &amp; 4 share the general pool of songs (I don't want to set the world on fire, Butcher pete, Crazy he calls me)
---
Fallout NV is more cowboy themed but shares the same theme and feel
---
Fallout 1 &amp; 2 they used some scores/Ambient soundtracks from those games but as far as i know nothing else
---
I say they are good in some games. I say bring it.
---
You reminded me of a thing.  
---
At my old job I would do all the work that my lazy coworkers didn't do. When I complained to my boss about having to do it all, he said "Well, then don't. Let the task fail".
---
I didn't see the logic because the work had to be finished, but later I understood: Sometimes you have to allow things to fail for others to see that their effort is needed and If they don't do their part, we all lose.
---
So If you think doing an event all by youself while others watch is unfair, then stop participating. Stand still like them. If the event stars to fail hopefully they'll see it and dosomething about it, if not, no one gets the prize.
---
If you’re focusing solely on farming violet. Try nuking Harpers ferry. You can shoot glowing enemies with the bloatfly larva syringer for a chance to spawn glowing bloatflies on the enemies death so there’s more chances of getting high radiation fluids. Then go collect violet flux afterwards so it doesn’t expire. Make sure to have green thumb before collecting flux and throw on super duper before turning it into stable flux
---
Yeah, perks are awful in adventure mode, but the selection in NW is epicly bad.
---
110% agree. The "Signs and Letters" plan is way better than the one offered in the Atomic Shop.
---
I doubt they’ll even find out tbh
---
You just posted this earlier but still cool
---
Generally this could be a lot of things:
---
Most commenly its the pc's firewall blocking the game for no reason what so ever. This happend to me for instance. If u want a sanity check. Try connecting your pc/laptop to your phone's hotspot and see if it works then.
---
Ps. Keep up the good work comrade
---
Rose has plenty.
---
I tried Riding Shotgun for the first time today and I had the perk equipped, but my Flamer didn't seem to heal the Brahmin. We still passed the event, though.
---
What triggers them dropping?
---
that's okay
---
if they did add the option you can bet it would be clunky and poorly implemented
---
I usually clear our Morgantown Airport and/or West tek.
---
TL;DR: Entitlement
---
Tell them to get a life lol.
---
From someone who plays fo76 almost religiously atm.
---
I see there was no comments so here's you one.
---
Hope your days in quarantine are going well
---
If u do the power up event its basically free real estate
---
The SQB and Nuke zones already don’t give good enough rewards. They would need to make the rewards not only better to catch up but also to make up for the difficulty increase. Plus what is the fun of being a high level, time invested in getting good weapons if you can’t flex on some stuff?
---
I am not a fan of NW.  Today i was there to get my 30 minutes.  I was hiding behind this nice boulder. My husband points out that the rest of my team is just up the hill,why don't I join them? I go up the hill, immediately get shot and killed.  Nope, my lvl 4 self will hide in storage closets, thank you!
---
Isn't the point of alien blaster rounds is that you can't get more? What am I missing?
---
I'm getting mans1ay3r/GamerPoop flashbacks.
---
My biggest problem with the Atomic shop ones (other than how gross they look at even a slight distance) is that they don't snap to each other like the neon lights from the signs and letters plan, so whenever I tried to use them my words always looked wonky, usually from the games own jankiness instead of my own ineptitude (note: i said usually :P)
---
Yeah that’s really shitty. Personally I would’ve done nothing but stayed there until the clock ran out.stealth armor and marsupial will keep you pretty safe for a few minutes on the roof of the shack. It would suck to waste the keycard, but you can always get more caps to buy another from a vendor.
---
I had a level 15 (magic) quad double barrel. Easily got me to 50. Uses Str which is always nice. Ammo pretty easy to keep stocked. Instigating would also be nice.
---
Gonna hop on this post and add, if you’re a level 200 or 300 something playing your level 7 alt, please don’t accept my gift of Radaway and Stimpaks. I’d rather give this to a real low-level.
---
This happened to me on my public team and I’m a little salty. There’s this level 4 dude irradiated to hell with low health. I FT over and drop him some stims and Radaway and he heart emotes. Then he leaves the team and re-joins as his character that’s 150 levels higher than I am -_-
---
My bro even had his mic on. A simple “Thanks but this is my alt” would have been fine.
---
I see there was no comments here before so here's one for you
---
Hope your doing well and we gett that scammer for you &lt;3
---
They unlock with overseer xp earnings. Survival and halloween each are non stacking xp challenges, xmas I hear is stacking. Though any overseer xp counts towards all three unlock line. Do a quick search and you'll see what you can get from each unlock line. Though it might be patched tomorrow.
---
I joined the event with my second character (lvl 3Xish) and the event ended about 10 seconds after I fast traveled. I was only going for the XP and whatever shit rewards I got, but I wound up getting the imposter outfit. Didn’t have the heart to show it off on site
---
I don't even like the PvP in this game and I agree with you, I'm surprised someone at Bethesda didn't think of this to be honest.
---
A post complaining about complaining. Irony lives.
---
I joined the event with my second character (lvl 3Xish) and the event ended about 10 seconds after I fast traveled. I was only going for the XP and whatever shit rewards I got, but I wound up getting the imposter outfit. Didn’t have the heart to show it off on site and I don’t even have a way of giving it to my main character that I wanted one for.
---
Gail, ra ra, and weasel are great.
---
Agreed, when I kill a legendary now I keep laser eyes on where they landed and walk straight to the corpse and loot it, even when there are 5 mobs hitting me while I do it. I've lost more than 1 in the grass that shit's infuriating.
---
I see there was no comments before so here's one for you!
---
I hope your doing well and get better at pvp &lt;3
---
It is cumalative! Takes about 4 matches.
---
unless you do something insane like 8xp/millisecond nobody at Bethesda really cares
---
You have died on the Oregon Trail.
---
Sorry friend, my heart belongs to Weasel.
---
You should be addressing the community at large rather than this guy. They're the ones acting like petulant children. Look at all the downvotes that positive comments are getting. That's not how Reddit votes are supposed to be used.     
---
At least this guy takes the time to verbalize a response instead of just mass-downvoting every positive comment like a coward.     
---
And you should really look up the definition of 'condescending' the next time you need a mirror.
---
Alright now I’m picturing Ward with the dancing mod and that is not a mental image I needed thanks
---
Berry mentats highlights both living targets and dead bodies in pink mist
---
I see there was no comments here before and here's one for you!
---
Hope your having a great quarantine and get alot of great friends
---
Alternately, I think it would be fun if they added a location on the map with an arena for classic FPS games, like TDM, CTF, Last man standing, ETC.
---
There's this time I launched a nuke with my friends to take down the SBQ with a new gun we adquired, so we took her down quickly.
---
A guy shows up and starts screaming "OMG YOU KILLED HER ALREADY? YOU OWE ME A LEGENDARYYyYy"  
---
I was like "Dude, nobody owes you anything.  How about dropping your own nuke?"  
---
He replies "How about.....no"  
---
I LOL'd hard.   
---
The sense of entitlement of some people in this game is very funny.
---
Crysis?
---
Bashing pump shotgun and VATS. Aka magic weapon. Still using my lvl 35 vampire bashing pump, and I’m lvl 190.
---
The point of alien blaster rounds is ammo for the alien blaster
---
You would think Bethesda would have thought that through a little better
---
They don't.  You have a list of the last 255 items you've looted.  If you spawn an area of the world, basically no one has been in that area for 10 minutes, then it just checks the list and doesn't spawn things on it.  It all happens as you load in from quick travel or whatever, it's basically instant.
---
A few are legendary, but only that they have increased damage against robots. I compared the damage for all weapons when they were in my inventory and with no difference if I equipped them or not.
---
If you don't mind me asking, what have you been farming? I've farmed Glassed Caverns a good bit and am only like 25. Wondering if there's a better way that isn't doing the god mode stack XP glitch.
---
If it's really bad and none of the other suggestions work, try this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aqLwHP4y6Q however be warned, this cure can be as bad as the symptom so be very careful.
---
Man cooking is the worst. I come out of uranium fever with about 58 glowing meat and go to cook them into steaks to vendor them, it literally takes like 3 seconds per steak as the game freezes for a second after each one. 
---
I really wish you could just craft them all as a stack, even if it created like a 10 second pause.xbox.
---
No, just "simple" legendary ones. But that western revolver for example is not legendary.
---
Jealous! congrats though :)
---
10k exp is kill 20 suoermutant
---
Reported.
---
If posts about this were a drinking game, I'd have alcohol  poisoning
---
I would hate that to happen to anyone but  it happens and I really hope you get it back if u play ps4 I could try and get you a new one
---
That’s some big brain gameplay right there
---
Edit: do flux count as chems for the Chemist perk?
---
90% of the player base doesnt care or want to do PVP, they want more of a co-op experience. So BGS isnt going to do anything to the PVP. If you want to PVP your better off playing another game.
---
That's awesome! If only the wrapped cap that matches it also allowed the gas mask to be worn underneath so you could have the cut raider outfit look from Fallout 4 (https://i.redd.it/nlk673fieda31.jpg)
---
Seriously, isn't the point that you can't hardly get alien blaster rounds is because there is no way to make them on Earth?
---
(I assume you're being sarcastic with your response. No way that was a serious comeback lol.)
---
NO JUST... NO!
---
Same to you! I'm not that great at PVP, I just usually try to see how long I can hide for. Lolz.
---
\~ 25,5 ....  
---
grind grind grind -.-\*     
---
doing 10 -12   SBQ's per day + 3 -4 Encrypted  and a lot of the other pub-events.  
---
But i don't think i will do this the complete season,... i'am tired of this grinding... it becomes more and more borring
---
Last time I dropped stims and stuff for a group of under 10s they complained about it.  Too much shit drops anymore.  It's not a survival game, it's an inventory management game.
---
It's also at the bottom of the ladder, where things of low value are appropriate. I don't see the problem.
---
What did I do?
---
Yeah but what about plastic?
---
I see there was no other comments so here's one!
---
I have that bug to but also I hope you have a wonderful day
---
to be fair, the 95% not hitting (even several times in a row) is because of how the chance system works behind the scenes. if you ever played xcom im sure you're getting ptsd right now..  
---
 [https://fed76.info/a/how-things-shoot/](https://fed76.info/a/how-things-shoot/)  &lt;&lt; after reading this article to get a better understanding of how it works, i started thinking about it, and those 95% misses actually makes sense now, and can to a certain extent be worked around \^\^
---
I alway go for the 3 pilons
---
Yikes. This might have been a blessing in disguise after all.
---
Get this shit with my lever rifle. And it has vats enhanced on it. Fortunately I have power user and a ultracite gat as a backup weapon to vent my frustration.
---
When you shoot it your avatars pinky is up
---
Yea its bugged
---
That's just how I respond to over-the-top drama queens.
---
You gota find your fun with it or youll get bored with it pretty quick. After all the inital exploring and newnes of it all wears off your guna find yourself having fun juggling caps as a vendor, smashing raidbosses snd server hopping, and grinding your ass off for different currencies and rare gear. If you dont like that then play story and wait around for events or more dlc to pop up.
---
&gt; you'd think they'd fix the bug
---
First time playing a Bethesda game?
---
That is exactly why I quit Destiny and I already hate that it's happening in this game too.
---
Whaa? I'm on xb I dont find that.
---
I saw someone say that doing that can reward a lot of points XD
---
Changing special points is a huge waste. Especially since legendary perks are coming soon. I’ve never been a big fan of MMO’s but I at least understood what this game was since launch and accepted it. I have 5 complete characters. All different builds to make the most of each weapon and can switch between bloody unyielding and junky vanguard play styles on each. I still see people that have been playing since launch that play like it’s FO5 with one character and many “builds”
---
Complete disregard for bugs
---
How prevalent exploits are
---
Basic clipping issues
---
Fallout is a great setting. There is a great world, atmosphere, and so much great lore and storytelling. I play frequently, despite frustrations because of this. Also, despite the prevalance of exploits the community is much friendlier than a lot of others. So a great community.
---
I wish it was a great game, but at least it is pretty fun when the bugs aren't making me wonder why i keep playing. That said... Even when i "quit," i do come back for more.
---
After 50 is just fine tuning and unlock perks. A lvl 50 with the same build, same equipment would do the same damage as a 250. Although some of the better perks are unlocked after 50
---
Rng is terrible , I have a better chance being Superman than getting a decent purveyor roll
---
Don't forget Vampires.  They are very helpful at low levels.  Instigating and Junkies are more powerful.  Bloodied are great if you have the right armor to back them up.  Even AA can be ok for starting out.  I rode a swing speed Vampire's cultist dagger for a long time in the early levels.  I couldn't die.
---
I'm on Xbox but thanks
---
Who doesn't want more dick to pop up?!
---
No. I’ve tried:(
---
Building at your camp barely benefits from intelligence anyway. I feel like "crafting" would have been a better title for the group.
---
It just needs a sliding scale for buying and selling, and the ability to buy and sell bullets in single point increments instead of multiples of 3 to 100 depending on ammo type
---
I’ve found there to be a trick to encryptid if you have an extremely high damage bloodied build.
---
Stay in sneak and shoot her before pylons are active, make sure everyone gets a decent shot in. 
---
She rubber bands and regens but your still taking enough health off to guarantee the drops. Then get your tank to activate pylons, absolutely no point in getting a bloodied to do this. Just make sure the sacrificial tank has got the shots in first. 
---
Just before the pylons come into play when you are at 2/3, start loading into her so that when the pylons come on she’s already down. 
---
This has worked for me. 
---
My only issue here is the eyebombs when I’m concentrating fire on the assaultron as it wipes out my entire health
---
Could you? Yes.
---
Will you? Unlikely.
---
Weird... but since I'm in the comments anyway (I I'm bord as heck) I hope your having a wonderful day and I hope this gets fixed too&lt;3
---
Can you pm me your modlist?
---
If you don't mind dropping the jetpack for protocols, you can put an excavator torso on any armor to get the mining bonus.
---
I'm getting the same numbers on SBQ so I think Stabilized is fine.
---
I will say that since moving to pc stuff like this is easier as I’ll just spam the number key in favourites. 
---
Does FO76 work with m&amp;k on Xbox with the razer turret etc?
---
Silver shroud outfit?
---
Watoga high school is a good place, same for Morgantown high school
---
I hope you get another even better one soon!
---
They claimed events would award score but they do not.
---
I would appreciate it if they removed vats, people who run around vats'ing their own grenades to wipe entire teams instantly is really goddamn annoying. It makes it difficult for new players to get into a long game when one grenade instantly wipes.
---

---
The highest individual point reward is based on his long you survive, which I suppose makes sense in a world where staying alive longest is more important than kill count. Lolz.
---
Having messed with them in the PTS: What Rads? is incresible and I hope they don't change it at all. Follow Through and Taking One For The Team are similarly great. Retribution was underrated, people don't respect melee blocking enough. Brawling Chemist was fun but the chem or rate it generated could have been better, and it needed to be more clear that the perk was melee-oriented. Botany Buddy is an interesting perk I think could be awesome for nuke zones, but the actual buff wasn't worth it.
---
The armor perks had a good effect, people were just annoyed all three perks had the same effect. The perks to cause explosions on death weren't good at all.
---
Yeah full on fuck those people who purposely show up to the event just to collect people’s bags. I learned early on that you can’t take junk into encrypted which is a shame for people using junk shield
---
Apparently you think I've read all your replies, tho i will own up to my reaction being out of frustration with what i did read, i WANT that secret door, but feel a bit dicked over by devs who seem to want me to treat their game like a job, i already have one of those, i play games to relax, to then read i should just be more "dedicated" jumped down the wrong hole.
---
I weren’t cold turkey enough to almost cure my addiction then suddenly you made all my work go to waste 😢
---
Hmm...are those not the old ones they was gonna rework???
---
Calls someone condescending in the most condescending way. lmao what a fuckin joke. eat this downvote. There, I "verbalized" a response, im allowed do downvote now.
---
I use purified water because I get like 100 a day somehow
---
I just picked up the bloody builds. I was running furious heavies and instigating melee weapons, I had no problems. I only switched because I wanted to solo the wendigo.
---
Definitely a few other perks broken in 20.  Considering how many 95% shots I'm missing I think rank 3 of concentrated fire is busted.
---
I pretty much only eat corn soup since it's easy to grow and takes care fo food and water needs, though I do also grow mutfruit and  tato to make adhesive. I only use boiked water for cooking, I use purified for adhesive and sell the rest. I have 6 industrial purifiers so I get a ton of water to sell.
---
You can use the backpack with all apparel.  Note: power armor is not apparel.
---
Bethesda - please reward players with scrip and atoms if they put the shovel back after finishing the quest.
---
Thanks a lot for the praise :).. That is very kind of you. I am truly moved by your comment.
---
I see there was no comments here and I just want to say I hope your having a wonderful day
---
The story is great. Take your time to explore. Give nuclear winter a try, it's a good change up. Do events, build a fun camp. 
---
Know that there are quests and achievements that are bugged. Learn how to submit tickets to Bethesda for that kind of stuff. And check back here when you need help.
---
Charred Ferals slap you around for around 50% health, why are you surprised?
---
The last two times I've seen the event pop up, everyone and their aunt is hiding on the roof, doing nothing.
---
I run around and grab all 3 pylons, and they all rush to one-shot the thing.
---
I haven't gotten a legendary from it either time.
---
I thought there were some outfits that don’t display the bag?
---
I don't get it why is it super valuable? I thought everyone used x01 over ultracite
---
i didnt realize you get to decide what other people do with their upvotes mr reddit bossman. got to make sure people allocate their internet points correctly!
---
didnt realize calling people delusional and entitled trash was a good way of discussing a topic.
---
and ironically, telling me to look up the definition of condescending is an incredibly condescending thing to say to someone. maybe thats lost on you, idk.
---
maybe it didnt occur to you that people have different opinions on the matter, and that not everyone is participating in the circlejerk.
---
Yeah for the Tasty Squirrel stew.. Just got back to 29K Caps.. first stop this evenig is MODUS for the recipe.
---
This would be a good legendary perk.
---
But the butcher Pete song in fallout 4's is a sequel to fallout 3's buture pete
---
Yup, I’m the idiot who disconnects from NW as soon as I get the score. Lmao
---
I don’t wanna stay in it longer than I have to.
---
Hate that kind of idiotic selfish mindset. 3 people show up, and then why not each take one. Unless someone is super min/maxed that for quest, which is incredibly rare, its about 5 fully levelup players job to do that quest. Especially its not "free" to start that event. I gladly go there if im not in a middle on something, and I make sure whether everyone gets the legendary and drops from the impostor. It happens quite often normal or legendary enemies disappear or fall to different location for others somehow. If anyone say they didnt get it, I make them add me, log out, log back in and search the area and 90% of the time they find corpse.   
---
This game is about cooperation, unlike any other game Ive ever seen or played. A friend is sad that he doesnt have a good legendary armor? Or obsessed with 3 star cultist blades, If its not 10K or something, I buy for them. And some other day when i need help to collect several stupid Scorchbeast meat that somehow doesnt drop for me? I find couple friends passing by and dropping it for me, along with some  legendaries if they dont have space or script quota.
---
A nuclear winter challenge would be fine as long as it was understood that if you missed out on doing them, you still had enough score to finish the board. What's unclear is if the NW challenges are all but mandatory to be able to make sufficient progress. Doing challengea like surviving a certain a.ount of time is one thing, but reviving teammates or even killing creatures is so problematic for me to get, that even though I enjoy NW, I don't want to spend hours trying and still not get it done.
---
Dont just stand there, get in on the action, dude.
---
To be fair if they are just buying the game there is plenty of story to make their way through, the overseers questline and wastelanders should keep you busy for several hours. 
---
Bethesda always knocks it out of the park with world building, and they tell a decent story. I quite liked the overseers quest and you get to experience the whole thing with NPCs which should be an interesting experience. 
---
Getting to 50+ and really building your character and finding legendary gear is also a "fun" grind at first, you get to feel overpowered and tear your way through Appalachia. 
---
However, the bad is that eventually you will run out of content, and the game becomes the grind. You will be able to get some cool cosmetics but unless you play pretty much every day it doesn't seem like you'll be able to complete the season 1 "battle pass,"
---
And of course, the bugs. The worst and most frustrating part of the 76 experience is that "it just works." From small to game breaking, you're going to experience bugs that only occasionally will benefit you (looking your way NW rewards), and will often leave you feeling empty and broken. 
---
But hey, start the main quest and see how you like it. Welcome to the family
---
I tested this for awhile, and around 400 DR and below 20% health it was 1-3 for charred and 2 for gangrenous cause of poison.
---
Oh.  I don't know.  You said use, so I said yes.
---
Where did you get that X-01 figure?
---
He's waiting for the player.
---
They should give the reward if you damage the mob or if you tanked pylons. That should be a nice incentive for others to tank the pylons too.
---
Because of what basically all games use a pass system for: daily content.    
---
They aren't there for something to be struggled over, they are there to keep people logging in and feeling rewarded.  
---
At the end of the season you want people to think -that was fun, I'm looking forward to the next pass, not -god what a horrible grind, or worse yet -I can only log in a few days a week so I just ignore the pass.  They should WANT people to expect to complete the pass.  
---
Not only do most games require much much less time investment to complete the pass they also offer reward banking for people who can't play every day, and often catch up events to boot.    
---
The way this system is set up isn't fun, like seemingly everything in 76 it's a slog, and that's a problem.
---
We already have level 100 players from the Godmode glitch.
---
I had lights like that on the wall yesterday that were moving in a line, really fast. Like speedy blinking runway lights. This was on PS4.
---
It's part of the Spring Bundle on the Atomic Shop.
---
What is a tattered field jacket?
---
West Tek and The Burrows.
---
Maybe if Bethesda actually made changes that fixed the broken state PvP is currently in and then added worth while PvP content the player base wouldn't be so opposed to it. 
---
PvP players shouldn't be pushed out of this game when it was advertised it would have PvP since the announcement. If anything the players that only want a PvE experience should play another game if they can't handle there being 100% option PvP, instead of further ruining this game for the people that bought this game expecting there to be a particular feature.
---
Just givin ya a hard time. You don’t need anyone’s approval. Seen plenty of people get worked up over all kinds of stuff in here. It is just a game.
---
Keep the purified water. 
---
Step 1: Equip super duper and chemist 
---
Step 2: Make diluted rad-x, stimpacks, and radaway 
---
Step 3: Profit
---
IMO since you can't move I don't think it's such a big deal. If someone spots you while you're in photo mode, even if your reaction time is good you're still at a disadvantage.
---
Ah damnit... ;-; I was hoping to add some to my place. No wonder I cant find what it's called.
---
Ha ok cuz I dont play NW because I hate battle royals. Ok then have a great day! &lt;3
---
Lemme put it like this:
---
Bethesda does not know their community and regularly makes bad decisions 
---
The community is a group of amazing weirdos who make the game more enjoyable
---
The leather coat without the travelling backpack attached can have backpacks applied visually. I’ve been rocking mine with an atomic shop back pack for a while. 
---
You can still have backpacks with the travelling variant, but they do not display. 
---
Another couple of outfits that prevent your backpack from showing are the union outfit, and the BOS science outfit.
---
Dirt tiles are a reward for settler reputation, 2nd highest rank I believe. The Brahmin pen plan can be found at different robot vendors and I think Graham has it often. 
---
As far as cranberries I am not sure if you can plant them? Maybe their bases have been on naturally occurring cranberry bushes.
---
Edit: dang ol atom shop
---
Fireproof is definitely screwed.  Sometimes it works fine, other times one sonic blast hits me and I am down.
---
Removed, and the rewards got shipped over somewhere else for purchase.
---
Haha that's funny anyways since I'm here hope you have a great day
---
I agree with you.. mostly those kits the SBQ drops are more of an anoyance because the have weight and still have 50 of them and they never drop below 40. Thats 10lb permanently blocked. But they are to nice to have to throw away. I tossed my 3 scrap kits I got from I don\`t know where. Absolutely no use for them. My stash is at 800 permanently.
---
In more close-range team combat where you're trying to keep an eye out for people sneaking up on you, it's a pretty handy tool.
---
It is for sure not as helpful as it would first seem though.
---
I already got a full suite of T-45 for you mate, still keeping it but I havent heard from you from anywhere, here, steam or in game.
---
Yeah I saw the pen plan, and I found out the other thing for cranberry bog tree planter is an atomic shop item from spring. I really wanted that but I hope they bring it back
---
A lot of people with FO1st grinded the daily and weekly atoms challenges, so they do care that they're gone.
---
ra ra felt like a tiny tina rip off.
---
The gifts are 100% duped, the plans and flux probably as well. No you will not be banned for having them
---
Didn't know this was a thing.  Interesting.
---
I don't use power armour but yeah they're rare and definitely worth more than 49c. I don't think they're as rare as the calibrated shocks though. As to which power armor everyone uses, I dunno they all look the same to me when everyone is running around at scorched earth 😂
---
None of them were interesting to me, at least not for the excessive cost.
---
It's a premium game.  They already have a cash shop, and a subscription that is fairly essential if you don't wanna deal with stash headaches.  That should be more than enough.
---
LOL I was joking that I reported you for hacking with photomode.
---
&gt;I swear, this sub is bipolar and cancer.
---
* *cough* * ^you're ^not ^wrong * *cough* * That's a bad cough i have...
---
I think it depends on the mood people are in on this sub, between post being removed for some bullshit reason, for example put "..." in the title, removed.  I've also had people downvote factual statements just because they don't like the information it contains, and upvotes for stupid comments I've made that deserve no attention.  Strange place, i *like* this sub, but prefer the filthy casuals sub lol
---
Huh.  I regularly do that in Adventure mode, but it never occurred to me to do that in NW. I'm just so used to VATS not working against players I've never tried it.
---
You need to either bash with the flamer or use a  shishkebab. For some stupid reason flames don't work with the perk.
---
Hmm? I didn't say that at all
---
Nice thanks -- yeah it seems there's no cap I found someone had 68 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hixc89/the\_best\_public\_team\_option\_is\_building/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hixc89/the_best_public_team_option_is_building/)
---
Considering that they moved the rewards to somewhere else, I have my doubts the raid previously in the game will come back, at least in the same form it was in before.
---
...but I mean, it's a raid. This is an RPG, that's like a requirement, up there with clogged inventory and fetch quests for 10 rat tails, it's a requirement to have them.
---
When wearing a power armor. You can use ANY weapon at all. EXCEPT unarmed weapons. Meaning death tambo. Brass knuckles. Power fist. Deathclaw gauntlet. Boxing glove. Anything that counts as a punching weapon, you can not equip.
---
I don't like them in principal, but some are much better than others, and 76 is not one of the good ones, imo.
---
Yep, Log in to do the daily and then do the rest of them. I hit level 100 a bit a go and I unlocked all the Holiday/Halloween stuff when it first came out, so I've been bush wookieing it in my ghillie suit on a daily basis.
---
&gt; protoctons and assaultrons got shitload of damage reduction on thier heads. TORSO IS THE WAY TO GO.
---
for robots I get much better results going for limbs. I can one-shot a level 52 protectron in the arm, but it takes three shots in the head and two in the torso. assaultrons idk those fuckers piss me off so much from early levels I just take out their legs and make them crawl now.
---
You have to restart the dungeon until it works. Don't get ahead of ra ra and kill every robot before approaching ra ra.
---
Sure does! I bought one shotgun shell.
---
Totally wanted to pick up some plans but homeboys prices were whaaaaaackkkkk
---
Annnd it's not... \*sadface\* one can hope right?
---
Use a fucking cryolator. For fucks sake people it’s not hard I can kite the mod taking 3 pylons with cryolator and just need someone with damage. Yes I’m high level but any group of 4 could do the same...Guess what cryolator also works with the queen etc. it’s like no one actually reads what weapons do. High damage ain’t shit without CC and if ya don’t know what CC is learn.
---
Alright, thanks for the fast reply
---
The best way to get your HM up to scratch is using the following perks and serums.
---
Max out all three Rifleman or Commando perk cards. (Personal preference.)
---
Demolition Expert 5.
---
Concentrated Fire 3.
---
Bloodied mess 3.
---
Nerd Rage 3.
---
Covert Operative 3.(When you log into the game un-equip, then re-equip. 3.75X damage multiplier when used with Mister Sandman, suppressor and at night. Should push damage per head shot into mid 2.5k. 4 shots to kill a Level 80 SB in mid flight, regardless of being legendary or not.)
---
Mister Sandman 2.
---
Stranger in Numbers 1.
---
Gun Fu 1.
---
For flavor, 1 rank of adrenaline.
---
Adrenal Reaction and Eagle Eyes are your damage buff serums for low health and crit boost.
---
The following damage will depend on your play style.
---
Solo Rifleman 423.Solo Commando 376.
---
Team Rifleman 456.Team Commando 406.
---
If you can handle the grind you can push the HM even further by making it Primed but only seems to effect the base damage for Commando builds (Note: Needs more experimentation), but you will still get the 50% damage buff for scorched with Rifleman.
---
Solo Commando 389.
---
Team Commando 420.
---
Then for the very adventurist, go lower than 19% health.
---
Team Rifleman 469 (15%)  482 (10%)  494 (5%)Team Commando 431 (15%)  443 (10%)  455 (5%)
---
This is only recommended for perfected stealth builds. At 5% health there is no margin for error. Enemies spot you, your done, acid attack your done!
---
But it does make it fun to push it right to the limit!
---
I kinda thought that's what you were doing, but you never know on Reddit whose gonna get a wild hair up their ass. Lolz.
---
Can confirm. Bought a plan from the vendor machine and it counted for the challenge.
---
Isn't that what hunter/ hunted is for? But I agree a pvp group would be a good alternative.
---
‘Old perks’
---
They canned the system to take it back to the drawing board because they were so underwhelming
---
God damn it... luckily I haven't come across this yet
---
no.
---
It’s VATS all together that is broken from 20, missed 5 shots with bloodied LA at 95% and perception boosted with all unyielding armor. Was running ground pounder and tank killer instead of concentrated fire and missed all shots like 10 feet from a hound at west tek
---
Thank you for the notes on it, and I'm glad to be apart of the vault dwellers now
---
Nice to see another Xbox player who enjoys NW casually. You sniper builds are essentially the only build I have trouble fighting since I usually use the grenade rifle.
---
no, i pretty sure bethesda will want to get use out of the man hours and work done on the vault raid. i dont know when, but eventually the vaults will have some purpose, and it makes sense that they return as some sort of repeatable content. the first raids level design and mission concept will likely stay the same.
---
i think moving the rewards to the secret service was just a stop gap to prevent people from getting too pissed.
---
It still works on the July update.    The Osmosis kit and the Portable Power Pack are the two best options to find.  I've come across a bunch of the medical scanners and thing that look like a microscope but basically anything that gets filed under the "junk" category is useless as it will disappear if you stick it in your stash or even try and display in in a case.  
---
Here's a few pics where they can be picked up:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/9Fq9fPD](https://imgur.com/a/9Fq9fPD)
---
If anyone is on PC I have some I can give you for free.  My latest character is "sim\_tech" as I worked on airline and military flight simulators for a living.  Come find me and remind me.  I have a couple of the osmosis kits as well as the power packs.
---
The tedium of actually using the machine pretty much makes it not worth the effort to me.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Wendigo from pts on pc? Or the Wendigo that appears sometimes in forest after nuke on fissure?  Only asking cause I've soloed the one in forest  after nuke a bunch of times with no issue.  Just seeing if the one on pts from event will be tougher.
---
I still highly doubt they would come back mostly the same as they were before after they removed them for issues, it just wouldn't make sense.
---
Yeah man, save the atoms for something else cool and try to get yourself "Plan: Signs and Letters" from Watoga shopping district or something. Bit pricey (13500 caps without hardbargain or grape mentats) but I think you can get them down to 9k.
---
"Head on" is just an expression lol, ill take any hit i can land, which is mostly torso... unintentionally 🤣
---
I have noticed the damage reduction hitting a Protectrons head though, so i do get what you're saying :)
---
People need to realize its a group event. It takes the Group.
---
Amazon! I do believe it’s still available everywhere though. Just look up quantum x-01 figure
---
Still waiting to be able to cook with purified water too.
---
The colossal problem one. I’m not on pts so it’s conjecture on my part. But, bloody heavy gauss faster fire rate is damed scary. Yes, I rolled one.
---
Sounds about like my bush wookie record. It's pretty freaking awesome when you get those bush wookie wins.
---
Yeah makes sense now! I am just building a super high int character for this season so have been cruising the old threads!
---
The respawn bugs, the inability to actually grind due to so many things being time locked, 3 star enemies not dropping 3 star loot.
---
Yeah but hunter/hunted is awkward, you have to stay tuned to a really annoying radio station that keeps broadcasting a loud beeping noise and automated message
---
It only starts when at least 4 other players tune into the station, so you could be hearing that for a long time 
---
Add onto that the fact that the announcement ping that people are looking trying to matchmake for that is very subtle, most aren't going to notice it. Plus there's the fact that there are only so many players on a given server, and you may be on a server where nobody is interested in PvP at all
---
If someone joins the radio station, gets annoyed at the wait and leaves, it starts all over again
---
It's a really messy PvP event quest 
---
It would be alot better if having the radio station on was silent, and instantly enabled PvP
---
Maybe rewards being based on unique kills or survival time
---
As another reminder be careful if you’re emoting to a low lvl player with the follow me and the gift emote. Apparently if you’re in a public team you can see when teammates emote. I was trying to get a lvl 10 to pickup a bag of loot I left, but my lvl 145 squad mate fast traveled to me and did the ‘confused’ emote then saw my paper bag there and picked it up before the low lvl knew what was going on.  At least he threw a heart at me anyway haha
---
Give it a try, it's difficult to learn at first but once you figure it out, its busted as hell. Pulse, Nuka, and Plasma are the ones you want to use, but MIRV works in a pinch.
---
Having a million outfits doesn’t help, either.
---
Ha ha, I hear you. It's like I'm only one there at the death field, and just chases after me. It was doable before when I ran 4x Troubleshooter's, though. Now went the "dark side" ( bloodied/unyielding/vats shotgun ), and can't actually survive, but at least I 1shot Gutsys that appear there.
---
Your card, your rules.
---
Friend and I started the event the other day and waited for others to join - I was intending to initiate when we had at least 5 or 6 people or the clock ran down. Instead some random arrived and initiated it with 3 people and 7mins left on the clock. Seriously? 
---
2 things should be changed IMO:
---
1. Only the player that starts the event can initiate the recall, or scrap the recall mechanism all together and just use the clock
---
2. Guaranteed drops even if you don't tag the mutton head
---
Oh man, a pvp team! Everyone on one team is friendly but another team is hostile. That’s a brilliant solution.
---
I ran into that same thing a couple months ago...
---
I've had that happen, luckily the only bug I've encountered with score.
---
You are very welcome. Rise up! RISE UP!
---
15  I'd like those end-level rewards but something tells me I'll get bored of the grind.
---
Encrypted is a badly structured, chaotic event that brings people together as much as it divides them. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you might even get a fixer plan. Let's just all agree that head lasers are bullshit.
---
Yeah, I made a thread about it back before patch 20 dropped but I doubt any Bethesda employees saw it. They fixed the Treasure Hunter and Insurgent hats, which had the same issues, so I'm hoping maybe if I make another post and tag the community managers this time they might actually fix it in 21 or 22.
---
I have completed the event like 10 times and have gotten 3 fixer plans. (After i bought 4 for 5k caps each)  R.I.P. my caps lol
---
Exactly. As quest nerd that likes to read instructions, I've tried to pick up all the pylons so I could "damage the Imposter", and couldn't tell why I die miserably fast on my lv 46, or why the hell are so many high lv players around?!
---
Anyways, was amusing to see so many "help" emotes in single area :D
---
I don't understand where you got the desire to be so rude to someone. It would seem you skipped over the fact that the randoms joined in and Verbally harrased O.P.
---
Pardon to say, but i think you just went on to reply your spiteful words over the fact that O.P. was not "optimal" in his was of doing his event. It would be fine to point out that yes, Crowd Control is Great for Solo events, but you needn't belittle O.P.
---
I would say way more than 10% of players would like a better and more high risk high reward PvP experience 
---
I do agree the majority doesn't, but plenty expressed disappointment with how little the PvP affects the main game during launch and even still today people express that
---
PVE should totally be the focus but I wish Bethesda didn't just give up on the survival mode and NW maps and their other PvP ideas
---
I like them, but I hate that there is no roleplaying option to at least try and 'save' Ra-Ra from her tragic fate of being raised by thieving cutthroats (optionally with drug addictions). She is already well on her way to being a good little raider.
---
Never assume anything is "fixed" in a BGS game.
---
Is it? I didn't know
---
no, it makes perfect sense, the already built the world space, set up the premise for it opening and closing again, ect
---
bethesda is lazy, they like to reuse and flip assets, and the problems with the raid were technical, not conceptual. it would be totally like bethesda to re-release the first raid with no timer and call it a day.
---
Fedoras are pretty cool tho
---
Shotguns are glitched and don't do proper damage outside of vats. Doesn't seem to effect combat shotguns IMO though
---
There's literally an ammo converter, one of the most requested objects the game's had, at level 5.
---
Yes, the UI as-is was conjured from hell, but the lead game designer has said they want to change it to make less burdensome for players to use.
---
Why wood guille armor? Why not make it for every armor in the game and then you can have more then one skin in the battle pass. Who uses t45 power armor? At least put stuff in that people can use
---
Coming from a mostly solo player(much social anxiety), this is why I rarely trust anyone anymore. I've had quite a few "low level" players ask for a bunch of stuff or help, which my stupid ass was more than happy to help or give a stupid amount of items, only to find out that was their alt and they just wanted to get through levels easier. It's become very lonely in the wasteland, but I guess that's the point.
---
Lucky break and luck of the draw proc but don’t repair at all, it’s annoying as I’ve now eaten through my scrap repairing everything.
---
To do the Cryptid Event, you need a Tracking card to place onto the lure to begin the event. You can't fight the Event till you do so. You are awarded one by completing the Mystery quest tied to the event, but it's easier to just spend the caps on it, as most Vendors sell the card in the misc section.
---
You can earn 30k exp faster in Adventure mode than you can earn today's NW challenge. If you don't like NW you just have to grind a little more exp in Adventure. What's your problem with them incentivizing people to play NW if you can easily make up the difference?
---
Currently Adrenaline perk completely broken, Carnivore doubles meat food effects, but no effects from plant foods, Herbivore the opposite.
---
Happy cake day
---
I had a guy all day who kept doing that for feed the people, was me and 1 other guy and the other just sat there and basically watched as a group of ghouls destroyed one of the consoles and moved to another
---
Yea it is cool right!
---
That's how carnivore and herbivore are supposed to work though?
---
All this time I thought it was a random event-- I've never triggered it and didn't know I could, other than the initial time running through the quest, which I thought merely unlocked it to show up.  derp.
---
I knew they where related. But id didn't know it worked like that
---
Cool as hell
---
Well put, I fully agree
---
I play my game occasionally from the Bethesda launcher when I know there are updates to install, otherwise I prefer running the game directly from the exe
---
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher\\games\\Fallout76\\Fallout76.exe
---
I have a shortcut to that on my desktop, this means I don't need the launcher running that has caused me problems. To make my login credentials auto fill,
---
Add these lines to your \[Documents\_Location\]\\My Games\\ Fallout 76\\Fallout76Custom.ini
---
\[Login\]  
---
s76UserName=your\_login  
---
s76Password=your\_password 
---
Can someone bypass the Steam launcher the same way by finding and running the Fallout76 executable? I'm searching for more about this as it is interesting.
---
Are you over budget? I had the same issue with my
---
Doors and purifiers awhile back and I think it was because my budget was maxed. I just deleted something and it worked just fine
---
Yeah, I somehow doubt all that.
---
We'll just have to wait and see.
---
you may try and raid my vault 88
---
people tend to have 2 definitions of what PVP is. one of them is were both partys basically agree to the fight beforehand this way each player has a somewhat fair chance of winning.
---
the other definition is 4 man gank squads steam rolling players who are grinding  that want nothing to do with it and destroying there camps which ultimatley leads to griefing/trolling and really puts players off. 
---
BGS isnt the one to blame for PVP being shit in this game. its the players that abuse exploits and use sleazy tactics to ruin peoples playtime/experience. I mean just look at what they were doing with teams and using a low level player to bait people into PVP while 3 high level guys in power armor with PVP builds were waiting behind a building just to come out and stomp them. I dont blame anyone except the mouthbreathers that do shit like that for PVP having no support from BGS and almost the entire player base.
---
Unfortunately, that is not the case. You can of course attack them but if they don't shoot back, you're not in pvp even if members of their team are in the process of taking over your workshop and everybody is within the limits of that workshop.
---
Your fine, i myself never actually bothered to complete it more than three times. I sorta moved on from 76. Haven't even hoped on to see wastelanders yet.
---
I had weird lighting glitch. My CAMP was placed in an area under the map and I had a mirror ball in one of my rooms down there. I moved away for about a month and then decided to move back and rebuild my CAMP in the same spot. When I got down there and began to build I noticed that there was a mirror ball effect still reflecting on the rocks down there. Mind you this was a month later.
---
You also can open your pip boy and place a camp down and build whatever you want
---
Unlimited resources 
---
You can even spawn in blueprints you made in the main game
---
Some shotguns get bugged damage. I have one that does around 4-5x damage in vats
---
It was. There was a string of people that got lower level ones than they were supposed to when it first came out.
---
It doubles all effects of food, not just Hunger like before. Grilled Radstag with Carnivore went from +20 carry weight to +40, with Herbivore the bonus is zero.
---
Would you not receive just as must as selling separate?
---
You can either just wait hope it fixes its self or give up and start over in a different silo you still have your keycard.
---
I only just started playing it for the score but im actually having a good time! I thought it was gonna be super sweaty. I dunno maybe its just all the other noobs like me trying to figure things out but i can hold my own just fine! Once you get a hold of a decent set of gear you can donsome work, just gotta go for the headshots. If only i had the frames.... : /
---
I have about 10% space left. It seems to only unlock itself if I reload the game.
---
Leave and come back, let them die and replace them, or get a friend to come into the prep room. These are the steps we use but not always 100% work.
---
i totally feel you bro, it happened to me aswell. The event could be designed better but some players should stop rely on others and start doing something
---
Damn, wth? I'ma a level 202 &amp; frankly, I have a lot of trust issues with people level 100+ cause builds. Honestly, if I wanted to be nice &amp; give supplies to a lower level, I would use emotes to get them to follow me or send them a message. It's good that you're doing that tho, it's very sweet of you.
---
That's interesting, maybe I'll buy a mic, does it have to be a fancy one like the streamers use?
---
They're all dead but it shows 5/5 even though it should be 0/5
---
Meg is on borrowed time anyway, especially if you don't side with her in Wastelanders. They are living in a poisoned hellhole, apparently where they came from being nicer, that can't even sustain their failing little farm and surrounded by toxic water, with a closed but still highly/deathly radioactive fissure nearby. Her bed buddy is a chronic backstabber who she shows blatant favouritism to. Her inner circle consists of this backstabber, a rage monster and her pet kid, and a suicidal ghoul. The rest of the 'gang' are typical raiders who are clearly chafing at her Diehard management style.
---
Give it a few years and they will be your typical Commonwealth/DC style band of junkie bandits.
---
All silos are complete besides this one, and I've put in too many resources into it. 2 fusion cores and 6 plasma cores
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Paige softens up once it becomes clear you aren't a threat. He can even be joked with, towards the end.
---
Gtfo is it really?! Damn. Neat. Thanks :)
---
You’ll end up making more with the two perks equipped. One stim turns into 4 diluted with a chance of two more diluted.
---
Whatever their thinking was, I've gotten some awesome PvP shots with the freecam so I'm good lol
---
Store it then place it back down, then lock it.
---
Yeah man.. Usually I am hiding away being a conduit and just get my hits in a the beginning.. Then the things dies somewhere, explodes and lands on the other side of the moon.. I hate that.
---
It's the whole benefit of gamepass. To be able to just switch between the two at any time with cloud saves
---
You got a friend that can enter?
---
I'm sorry but again that's how the carnivore and herbivore mutations work? Unless I'm super misunderstanding.
---
if anyone gives you something or drops it in front of you, grab it with both hands and use it 
---
i recently went to a camp owned by a lvl 20 and just dropped 10-15 extra plans
---
I've been there you can try and fix it by dying and seeing if that resests it but if it doesn't and you keep going soon you will have run completely out of ammo. I'd quit with what you have switch to a new server and try again
---
I've... never come across this encounter. I'm a level 202 &amp; I've NEVER seen this! Man, I've thought I've seen everything. Haha.
---
IIt resets at 5pm BST,, and I believe we are 8 hours ahead. So your reser should be 9am?
---
The finale is always more intense, just have to hope one doesn't have a premature claimaculation 👀
---
No, I play solo
---
General message to all. OP flexed and said I take all 3 pylons use all my stimpaks and look at my result. One must wonder why you decided to defend OP. Ransoms will join a public event... it’s the lack of forethought and the flex with wondering why the outcome was the way that is was. Maybe I’m just a tough love guy, what are you? You see my “faults” but not OPs? Have at it.
---
Oh yeah.. show me that magic on console ;).. and thats like playing 15 year old shooters on 800\*600 resolution because the head pixel is larger that way. I´d rather have my textures :)
---
Lul what? I knew about the camp, but the unlimited resources and blueprints thing seems like a pretty big oversight.
---
I dont even care anymore really. So many people playing alts it just seems like everybody already has a pretty good idea of what theyre doing. If i ever do run into a real noob, they usually have a high level friend or two giving them everyrhing they need anyway. I usually just dump all my extras in places anyone can find them.
---
No you are right
---
Logging in every single day for 2.5 months and doing every single challenge is, in the grand scheme of things, far from "everything for free with no work". It's plenty of work, and the fact you still don't get max rank in doing so is as ridiculous as the gatekeeping you're still trying to do.
---
I played fallout 3 first (even when fallout 4 was out) and when I played follout 4 I was surprised
---
It absolutely does effect combat shotguns. 
---
Source: I'm a magic combat shotgun main.
---
I see in you're other comment you've put a lot of effort into it, if you're on PS4 I could come and see if it resets. But you can leave the silo and go back yourself, it will all be as is for about 15 mins before the lasers reset.
---
On my pa character I take all the pylons, but on my bloodied I just don't have the hp to take that much punishment. Most non bloodied won't even take a single pylon. If pylons got extra xp/rewards, im sure people would change their tune.
---
And canned meat stew from mama dolce's
---
Some seemingly random legendary effects are causing this on all shotguns, including the guass shotgun. The legendary effect doesn't even need to be on the weapon, it can be on your armor. Is it cheating? I don't know.
---
Good to know. I only said that cu I went from a non legendary combat shotgun which seemed to work fine to using a legendary twoshot pump action that seemed to do nothing.
---
Yeas!
---
Ohh good idea Gatling later or summit
---
Because if you can't make it you can pay to win. Anyone can succeed if they open their wallet. Outside FOMO/Fear of Missing Out, the game going a pay-to-win direction has been a concern since year one, and this is one big step closer to that since most of the 'steps' are actual ingame resources and/or buffs, such as the lunchboxes being significant XP boosts, and some being Bullion rewards (albeit small ones). Even perk packs are valuable, as they 'fund' the Legendary Perks when they eventually release, meaning the game now has a round about but actual pay to win system now.
---
If it was just a hard grind with no ability to pay your way through there might be 15% less annoyance.
---
Hit up tanagra town every 10 mins or so when you’re farming acid. Head 3/4 of the way up the top and there’s a cave full of cave crickets; with butcher’s bounty you’ll get 50+ every visit. Take Hemlock Holes Maintenance for 30 acid every 10 minutes, but be prepared to defend it from event attacks. If you end up with some super high level with lucked out TPE weapons taking it, just server hop. In my experience, people seem to take hemlock holes very serious and will go to extremes like nuking your camp if you resist too well.
---
A world where people unquestionably swallow whatever trash is handed to them by Bethesda is not one you would enjoy for long.
---
I played Fallout 2 and later 1 on my old mans Compaq PC back in the day. There was no music (or atleast what my degraded child brain can remember) i played FO4 many years later and just took those two songs for granted
---
Nope just how the games suppose to go lol, it's in the tutorial I'm pretty sure 
---
I have a lot of creative blueprints for several situations, it's a lot of fun for me haha
---
Take your time to explore and don't leave the Forest too early. Leave the Vault and explore the surrounding area to build up your junk supplies. Do the Flatwoods quests but when you're directed to go to the airport, wait until you're at least Level 10 to take better advantage of the rewards. Throwing knives are awesome at lower levels, particularly against robots (and are also a great way to use excess steel clogging up your scrapbox) and also lower level enemies.
---
Most of all, have fun exploring!
---
I’ve been really enjoying NW. I just don’t put pressure on myself.  I just play and have fun. I kind of pretend I’m in Adventure mode anyway, but it’s just a lot more dangerous - lol. It’s pretty exciting. And if I die, so what! . Im level 149 in Adventure mode and it’s a nice break from the grind to play NW.  I wonder when Bethesda is going to add another map?
---
Your uncivil post insulting the other poster actually makes their point doesn't it, if you can't even remain civil on this Reddit thread I wonder what red delights you have to give other players over the mic in Fallout76? 🙄
---
hmm fuck was unaware that was rare I sold it at like a vendor bot lmao
---
I'm on Xbox sadly, but I have decided to just leave it be. I will try again tomorrow
---
definitely use the crystaline barrel mod, the others are optional
---
a two shot or faster fire rate freezes the queen faster, quad saves reloadtime
---
hits do count for freezing, crits or damage dealt changes nothing
---
other legendary effects do not change the rate it freezes
---
the level of the cryo does not affect freeze rate, eg a lvl 35 freezes as fast as a level 45
---
tldr: use crystaline barrel, all cryos are the same, only ffr or two shot give benefit for freezing
---
Hype. People that blow through season 1 will have the next to look forward to.
---
I died and the problem still consisted, so I decided to leave it be
---
No theres infinite. They spawn at this very hard to access location, you gotta server hop to get more. Look it up, it's crazy how difficult it is lol
---
I did that with my ncrvet cosplay also.
---
Before the patch Carnivore and Herbivore only altered the Food stat, now they effect every stat  
---
[Grilled radstag](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grilled_radstag_\(Fallout_76\))  
---
Before:  
---
+10 rads  
---
+60 HP  
---
+20 carry weight  
---
+40% food  
---
with Carnivore  
---
After:  
---
+120 HP  
---
+40 Carry Weight  
---
with Carnivore
---
Yeah I hate you can see my stupid face with the wrapped cap! Any other suggestions to go with tattered field??
---
You can start it once for free after the Wolf quest (dont know exact name). After that you can craft the card but you need a circuitboard you can buy from a vendor for 2500 caps.
---
Interesting, I’ll check it out mate, thanks
---
try it with the crystaline mod, after two magazines she should slow, freeze on 3rd
---
sweet, need that
---
True, and people that want to grind out an entire season or buy one would still have that option.
---
Thank you so much I will use this, thanks for the great tip
---
There’s also something odd happening with VATS damage too. I did surface to air last night, stealthed I (in theory) do 1000/1100 damage on a headshot, which should one shot scorched.
---
It was only taking 80% of HP - and when I unstealthed the 300 damage shots I was taking was doing the same.
---
Ah ok, it's definitely worth fast travelling out first, when you go back everything will be the same and no robots will spawn on your way through until prep room.
---
Gotta need those free caps though.
---
Turn on your damage numbers. But aa with melee is pretty useless if you're running incisor
---
I guess they are talking about one being able to have herbivore and still benefit from meat buffs. Being herbivore and eating meat would do nothing in terms of satisfying your hunger but you'd still get the buffs.
---
Never made sense to me and, quite frankly, this change was one of the more welcome ones.
---
Not sure what happens if you rock both mutations. I've seen people with both but I never tried it myself.
---
How does herbivore help
---
I understand your point. But BGS is going to focus on PVE because thats what the majority wants so thats were the money is. It wouldnt make sense not to cater to those players because if they are happy and enjoy playing all the new content they get, they will continue to buy Fallout 1st subs and atoms. its a no brainer. Not to mention keeping the majority keeps their metrics up to.
---
I fast traveled out and still heard the combat music even though the whole area around me was cleared out, and the launch prep was still stuck at 50% I appreciate the help though
---
Citation? I don't see that comment or quote anywhere within this post or comments
---
And look, i am just saying that you are being rude, the point is that people joined and verbally abused someone over mic, which is not good behaviour. "Tough love" is not what your dishing out, your just being rude, which isn't cool. And i will not "have at it" ain't polite to argue like that. If you can provide citation of O.P. speaking of elitism, then i will withdraw my defense. But the point remains, don't be mean.
---
you're probably not :)
---
So....then.....it was broken, and now it's fixed. Cuz it's supposed to double the benefits of meat and give no plant benefits. And vice versa
---
No worries mate, not sure which silo you were in but on PS4 Alpha can be terrible for bugging out like that, even though they all do break at times
---
Aha I'm in the main menu and still hear the same combat music. Thanks for all the help I appreciate it greatly
---
Good to know mate, you learn something new every day, in all this time I never knew this was a thing.
---
That's clearly a Fisto prototype.
---
I bought the spring bundle, and it 100% does not come with a cranberry planter. I read thing and I have scoured through every variant of every planter that I have - and they aren't there nor are they listed in the bundle contents.
---
I've been playing with grass disabled for a few weeks now because of this. Game runs a little more smoother and the dead are much easier to spot.
---
Yep it was alpha, I've always had issues with Beta and Charlie but never alpha. so I usually stuck with it
---
I never got to play fallout 1 2 and newvagas
---
Follow through and what rads for me. That first one will make me far more valuable for Queen fights, and the second is a big qol buff.
---
25 atoms have been deposited into your account
---
It’s a visual glitch that occurs when you join adventure after playing NW.
---
I can't even read this without crying a little 😭😂
---
Honestly. They are so fucking different. Its not for everyone. But if u have a few bucks laying around. Id try FO1.
---
I eat Canned Meat Stew and pretty much nothing else. I drink boiled water, inert flux or purified water (in order of preference), depending on what's in my inventory at that moment.
---
Yeah if you have carnivore then eating plants shouldnt do anything at all, satisfy hunger or give buffs, and vice versa for herbivore. So it was broken before and fixed now.
---
Pretty sure if you have Carnivore and get Herb it removes Carnivore
---
Ah but that would assume that Bethesda used logic to make their game developing decisions lol
---
We'll see what happens, you're probably right, but I'll keep holding out hope haha
---
One of the rarest outfits in the game. It can only be obtained as a reward for daily quests and events in the Mire, it has a **0.02%** chance to drop, and that 0.02% chance is shared with 2 other outfits (Leather Coat &amp; Traveling Leather Coat) so it's really more like 1/3rd of 0.02% if you want a specific outfit (though they're all worth roughly the same value so you could probably trade 1:1 for whichever of the 3 you want).
---
[This is what it looks like](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/f/f2/Fo4Tattered_Field_Jacket.png/). I know, it's not extremely impressive, but I just love how it looks.
---
Longshoreman outfit doesn’t show the backpack, but you still have it equipped.
---
The good;
---
Wastelanders story is pretty decent. However for the love of god do not run through it immediately.  Once you're done with it thats kinda it. 
---
People in game are usually willing to help other players especially if you say you're new.
---
You get free stuff from the season pass.
---
You get free stuff from playing nuclear winter which is their take on a battle royale.
---
The bad;
---
As I said once youre done with Wastelanders thats basically it. Late game is grinding the same once a day daily repeatable quests to get two seperate currencys.
---
You can only grind so much of both currencies per day. So there's a cap to how much you can grind if you even wanted to grind.
---
You joined when they just released the new feature the legendary run. Well your chances of finishing the free season pass/legendary run are pretty low because you need to log on every single day to grind dailys and weeklys.  A lot of them require you know what youre doing and know where to find enemies or resources.  If youre too low level to kill the stuff its gonna take you a while to complete even simple dailys.
---
Also suprise but the legendary run is a grind as well.
---
Nuclear winter is buggy. In my opinion it just sucks and rewards you too heavily for just staying alive. It basically encourages you to camp in a bush all game and not ever fight because thats how you get the most exp.
---
Thanks for the tips, but I’m confused.  
---
You said “make sure you end in Adventure “
---
and then you said “Do NW dead last”
---
So which should you do last?
---
Still more aware than some NW players I've seen lol
---
Ok. So I have hit it a few times. Got a matriarch deathclaw twice and nothing. Starting to think it has been borked again
---
Just remember your weight limit. I once farmed a shit ton of lead (and steel) and after smelting all the lead I was constantly reaching the weight limit. I usually just take a couple hundred and work through the ores little by little. When I made all the ammo I thought I would need, I had to spend a perk card to lower the weight of my ballistic ammo. (You also do not want to risk losing the lead when you die, so I would say smelt as you need)
---
I'll be honest. I once used to drop gifts. Sell plans cheaply. It's not worth it. If I sell plans cheap someone will wipe me out and a player gets no benefit. Dropping stuff is a waste too it could be an alt or others don't even pick it up.
---
I have an alt loaded with tons of rare and seasonal plans from every single event. I just wait until I make a friend have a few convos and then dump my entire inventory on them.
---
Sorry this happens but I'm learning more and more "war never changes"
---
You gotta post that sometime bro. I’d love to see it.
---
oops, i forgot all opinions posted here needed your specific approval, because, you know, freedom...
---
I guess the only profit you make is from the super duper? seems like an unnecessary hoop to jump through for so little caps
---
look for fusion generators, they have cores in them, i like to look for those near locations i am at anyways
---
i like to check both fusion generators at the fuzzy theme park when doing the dailies there
---
when i collect plastic in watoga high school there is a fusion core next to the labbench in the science lab
---
when farming stimpacks in watoga hospital there is a fusion core on a shelf in the room to the left up the stairs
---
watoga transit has a lvl3 locked door on the ground floor with a fusion generator and a pa frame in it (chance for 2cores)
---
hornwright tower in the ash heap has plastic on pooltable, lead in the gym and a fusioncore in a generator in the workshop area behind a lvl2 locked door
---
also fast travelling to poseidon power plant to look for the powercore that spawns on the table next to the fusioncoremashine is quick and rewarding
---
Not gonna lie I think it looks cool too
---
It never did this, It's always been just the food stat, and most likely it will be fixed by the next hotfix on Tues.
---
Yea do NW last on the list. After all of the challenges are finished go back into adventure and then quit the game. I sometimes just go back in adventure to play anyway but leave the game after being in adventure.
---
All of this is highly speculative. The only thing missing is lining tiny pebbles around a well and salt around a window 😂. But it's the best we can do right now.
---
Git gud
---
I thought they didn’t stack. I must have been so tired I mistook lag for it not going through.  If they stack, I’m buying a few and doing the old serum sale, buy from vendor shuffle.
---
This was such a pain until I could build fusion generators bc you have to power up the plant. But once you have the fusion gen plan OP just claim Poseidon workshop and build one to run the core machine, dont have to bother with the quest. Lock the core generator so anyone becomes wanted if they break it. 
---
Then just go around and play events or whatever and come back every 20-30min. I recommend having at least a few hours free to do this, I usually leave with 20-40 cores.
---
Im nice to every single person I meet in-game and give random strangers supplies even when I know it'll make the game harder for me in the long-run, but that guy was just a moron.
---
ive never powered up poseidon. I've claimed it many times  🤷🏼
---
System?
---
Xbox
---
When I need plastic, I just go to West Tek, equip scrapper perk, and scrap the laser rifles. Also, Watoga H.S. has lots of plastic plates, silverware, and bowls if you can get in.
---
This. Get 20 per gun. Westek, server hoo and you get plenty of steel and plastic and 556 too!
---
I'm saying I didn't have a choice bc I wasnt about to build 20 medium generators. How did you do it before you had a fusion gen plan?
---
Frog legs needs to be a found serum. It blows my mind that this is a perk card.
---
Legendary Fixer for the win. Recoil is worse but the damage is slightly higher.
---
i didn't do it until after the plans dropped for me. i got them pretty early on.
---
I had a guy look directly at me and just walk on by. 
---
https://youtu.be/ynI_Du1l4ME
---
adrenaline is definitely broken
---
the repair perks for weapons and armor, blocker, actionboy/girl, sunkissed do sometimes work but not reliably
---
No, wrong, very wrong.
---
These are very spot on suggestions. I've played well past 100 and have been lightly part of the NW community. Generally speaking most players leave because they are bored and because of the exploiters (PC which have been greatly reduced oddly). We need more zones. We need more perk card load out time (or even a perk card loadouts manager). NW has sooo much life and potential.
---
Last time I went (month or two ago) every time I died, no bag dropped and all my junk stayed on me.  I died like 5 times and had to Rez nearby and run back.  Didn’t lose a thing but wear and tear on equipment and such.
---
Exactly.
---
Because most of them were just underwhelming and more of the same. Like the armor perks.
---
Plus, I still don't understand why they didn't add some QoL perks. I mean, you're doing all of this for hours, weeks, months with no end in sight. It isn't unreasonable to assume that at some point you've, basically, finished school and gotten a certificate that shows you are at the top of your field.
---
Like, for example:
---
King of the Nerds: Hack all terminals, no Hacker perk cards required.
---
Cat Burglar: Same as above but lock picking.
---
Engineer: Ammosmith, Scrapper, Super Duper and the CAMP perks, all mashed into one.
---
Or give us legendary perks for the damage. Right now you need 3 3\* cards to max out your damage in whatever weapon category. Why not condense that into a single card that costs less? instead of 3 3\* for 20% each, 1 5\* for 60%.
---
There is fuck all in the current system that gives you any kind of "Yes, I truly mastered this" kind of feeling. It's just card swapping all the way from getting them all at level 50 to whatever level you are when the game ceases to exist.
---

Shit gtg in a few minutes damn

This is fucking heart breaking.
---
Think I can get ur gamertag?
---
40% take it or leave it.
---
Got any friends that'll be on then?
---
Bloodied, junkies, or armor piercing with explosive is what you want. If you ever go down the bloodied build path, the handmade and fixer are deadly with rifleman or commando.
---
This is a very back and forth, you're wrong - no you're wrong with very little evidence. 
---
Before it did one thing, after it did another. 
---
The mutation states that it doubles the benefits from meat/veg, so who's to say (except Bethesda) which way is the broken way?
---
Same as here. QuakeSumo
---
Good to know also while I was waiting for a reply I watched a whole video talking about infinity
---
Unfortunately no let me see if I can stay on
---
I tried this but it didnt work.Unfortunatly...
---
With GSYNC my monitor is flickering when I open vendors not annoying at all
---
I sent you a direct
---
With all that’s going this wait is normal right now.  
---
A lot of issues are filed by players, and there is only so many employees to answer them all.
---
Any endurance you have in your SPECIAL loadout increases HP by 5. Endurance from armor and under-armor is bugged and does **not** increase health. Endurance from food, chems and weapons does increase HP, AFAIK.
---
I heard a theory that two shot weapons calculate damage with 2 shots. 130 damage shot does 65 twice and which means DR reduces even more damage.
---
The broken is +40 to carry weight with Carnivore and +0 carry weight with Herbivore, before patch 20 it was always +20 carry weight no matter if you were mutated or not.
---
Are you on PC? You can have my 80ish about rounds
---
Like. The number infinity?
---
Ah, thanks! Been rocking a +E Power Fist for 80 levels, going to have to upgrade to something else.
---
Yes, it should remove the other mutation but there are people who have both. 
---
Guess I'll just make some serums and check for myself.
---
I struggled with ammo so much that I switched to a one handed melee build
---
I was in alpha yesterday and destroyed every mainframe core but it would not go below 25%, had to abandon it.
---
 I'd go with the marine armor helmet, ranger helmet, or assault gas mask. If you don't care about covering your face the grey knit cap goes pretty well with it
---
Indeed. So what if one week earning XP got your score, and the next week completing events got you score?
---
This way both statements would be true.
---
But we'll find out when the weeklies reset later.
---
How do you know it wasn't broken before? 
---
Grilled radstag is meat.+20 carry weight is a benefit of eating it. Carnivore doubles that benefit, Herbivore negates it.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, just wondering how you are so sure you're right?
---
I lied. I'm 21 as there is plenty of time to get all rewards.
---
I agree with you on that, makes the mutations more interesting.
---
PC, but thanks for the offer and support!
---
Not sure then. Have you got damage numbers on? It could just be a pipboy visual glitch so it'd be worth seeing if the numbers are changing. The only other thing I can think of is if you have adrenal reactions that will fluctuate with your hp.
---
This happens with my Junkie pump action +33%. 
---
Super deadly in vats.
---
Spitwads in free aim.
---
Technically infinity is not a number it is a word for a amount of numbers. Here let me ask you this if there was a hotel with a infinit amount of rooms and you wanted a room but all of them were occupied would you be able to get a room
---
Wait there’s a place to find AB rounds? I modded mine to take fusion cells and the damage dropped by a good chunk :/
---
&gt; By all accounts in Fallout 4 jet packs drained FCs really fast too.
---
I just said that they didn't.
---
It's been this way since the Beta of the FUCKING GAME!  
---
You're saying it was 'broken' for over a year and a half, since the game came out in November of 2018?
---
The arrow knew it wasn't that mole man's time to go
---
This. Exactly this.
---
Add an arena near the Crater and/or at the Top of the World.
---
Yeah I just noticed this bug today. Its pretty insane/entertaining watching a ton of scorched bodies flying through the air. Sometimes the bugs come through and provide some comic relief despite how broken this game can be.
---
I probably could yeah. If its infinite?
---
The flair gun could shoot UV flairs that highlight blood like the CSI shows, could highlight legendaries blood more/different. Or UV flash/pipboy light. But please no magic glowing corpses.
---
Ah well fuck me running it was someone with a top comment that said that. So I’m wrong there, fair enough. General thought though stands and like I said it was meant for the gen pop so to speak. So I apologize to OP and you for the part in which I combined two different peoples statements. What I say though holds for all. Lots of people complain about “no help” but instead of complaints look for solutions. Whining about the toxic portion of the community becomes a bit of a circle jerk. I, albeit roughly provided the solution. You sir are picking a fight. I did give constructive advice. So keep trying to manipulate my original thought that fits in with your narrative, so you can feel righteous or... fucking read and digest the actual advice I’ve given and you can thank me later. 
---
Also this is why people like me shy away from posting you create this community where if someone is even a bit harsh they are persecuted for that instead of looking at the message. Carry a cryolator, dmg doesn’t matter freezing a hard mob does in a difficult event.
---
Now tell me how I’m such a horrible person, also just consider perhaps I had a bad day and posted when I was disgruntled and wanted to help. But fuck me that would take some actually thought process from you eh? Enjoy keyboard warrior maybe what I have just said will make you think about life for a moment before you judge another’s words from a paragraph or two. One can hope.
---
I have this same issue and have had for a long time. Oddly my friend I play with does not. I can be in an event and die, have to leave the event and come back to it hoping it wasn't finished. I've gotten to the point where I'm very good at not dying. But when I do the risk of losing my stuff is real. 
---
What I have noticed is my character does respawn but I can't move them and I have the respawn word still there. I don't understand how it's consistently bad for me every single time but my friend never had it happen. It's an online game how is our experience different in such a big way?
---
I mean if it's an absolute GOD roll I'd probably keep it on the off chance shared storage or tradeable SS becomes a thing, but it's probably not likely
---
I guess it would have to be a stealth build with a silencer, so you can offset the low dmg with continuous sneak attacks. It’s not ideal compared to other builds out there, but absolutely viable. I ran a quad ffr 10mm on my black powder pistol pirate as a backup for a while, and with the sneak attacks it cut through super mutants pretty reliably :)
---
Precisely if you move everyone one room over you would get a room! So 1+infinity is infinity It dosent mater. &lt;3
---
If you would like another cool thing with infinity I'll be delited to... try? To explain
---
PC, but appreciate the offer.
---
I don't mind running Encryptid, but what bugs me is that the recall card costs more than your daily allowance of vendor caps!  I know, you can get more caps through other routes, but it still irks me a little.
---
Me too
---
When an event is going, I usually expect people to help
---
Hi, welcome to FO76, bugs, fun and a whole lot of rooms!
---
What a fucking horrible take
---
I think it’s consistently getting worse... like now it’ll take at least 3 fast travel attempts just to finally get it to start loading
---
And then time proved you right
---
Also, grab every pack and carton of cigarettes you see! Plenty of plastic to be had from them.
---
Yeah, I bought a cheap plan from someone and both of us got the score point.
---
Lmao this made me laugh out loud it’s so accurate
---
Photomode is really best used when your bush wookieing and can't see anything since your character is tilted a certain way to perfectly emulate the bush. 
---
Using it in other scenarios puts you at extreme risk of not being able to back out and respond to aggressors fast enough
---
Yeah, and now because of fomo, I spend more time in Destiny :)
---
Anti-Armor at best adds about 28% damage when hitting a sufficiently armored mob with no other armor penetration effects present. If you are not running a dedicated sneak melee build, your damage per hit is likely to be low enough that the Grognak's Axe might still win out over All Rise. If you have the Incisor perk equipped, though, AA is essentially worthless and you should use All Rise instead.
---
One other difference: Grognak's Axe is a whole lot more silent than that super loud Super Sledge.
---
Backlog of painting stuff for me.
---
This subreddit has become a hellscape of a debating ground for what's good and bad. The bad is very obvious however. Tons of bugs. I just can't list them all; it's a waste of time... 
---
However... I absolutely love playing this game. It's where I spend my precious gaming time. Wastelanders introduced NPCs with amazing stories. NW is a lot of fun and has made for some amazing memories. I've met a lot of friends in this game. 
---
The game can be grindy at times. The RNG on certain items can make it feel like you'll never get the good stuff. Being part of a couple of communities helps immensely.
---
Good luck with the game hope it turns out good for you!
---
Ohhh I have that stuff on Xbox too
---
The only reason I drink from punch bowls is to go on a nuke trip. Will definitely be doing it this way next time.
---
I also want Firecracker Berries and Glowing Sap or whatever that stuff is called, I churn out Karma Syringers for low levels.
---
I shall try that
---
during sbq fights i get the nonstop shooting mashine gun soundbug that was stated as fixed (like the crater yao guai lol)
---
cryptid powercoupling-sound keeps playing after event ends is also still a thing
---
a new soundbug i encountered is the silenced sound mode that happens when you take damage and hear your heart beat never returns to normal volume until you change the server
---
Are you okay? You seem very het up about this one specific issue. There have been plenty of bugs around for a very long time. 
---
No matter how it was before, you have to admit that the way it is now better fits the description of the mutations and definition of the words Carnivore and Herbivore.
---
Mmmm but papa level 400 needs his stimpaks
---
You can't lose junk anymore during events!
---
Blue Ridge Caravan mask goes pretty well with it too, as it plays well into the color scheme. But I agree, wrapped cap must be fixed - I even submitted a bug a while ago about it!
---
I’m not sure if it works if they are already dead, but their body will stay highlighted for a bit after you kill them
---
nope. that wont help. pvp doesnt exist, you have NW for pvp. adventure is full of bugs and that is what they should fix. and then add more endgame content - raids/dungeons, bosses, quests.
---
Also if you disconnect the headset (cause it's Bluetooth and runs out of battery) you lose all sound, and if you connect it again, it doesn't work anymore
---
Hemlock is a slow and pretty terrible way to farm acid, IMO.  You will regularly be attacked by low level enemies who will easily wreck your generators no matter what.  Not to mention other players who just like to fuck with people.   I built my camp on an acid deposit and built an extractor.   Combined with farming Snallygasters, etc. you can accumulate quite a bit of acid over time.
---
You must be replying to the wrong thread or something. That is the opposite of what I said, and also you fail to grasp the spirit of the post. This is not a post about Encryptid tactics (although I always appreciate the community's input) but rather about how entitled pricks talk down and verbally abuse and grief other players, even in an event where you actually pay to bring up.
---
there was an update already?!
---
Don't forget that you can spend caps as well. Most players sell ammo for 1 cap. If you're sitting on close to 30000 caps, spend a few grand on ammo.

When I ran a full health build I always took multiple (if not all) of the pylons to help out my bloodied friends. Now I find myself having to go up to full health and take them anyway really often because no one wants to. Most recently I started the event, no one was doing anything so after a few minutes I took all 3 and then some guy one shotted sheepsquatch. Won't be doing that again.
---
Same with me on Xbox
---
 What languages ​​do you understand?
---
Literally like 20-50% of high level characters have had high amounts of duped ammo, flux, or holiday gifts. You know all the mounted plans, Santa crashes, and ice light plans you see in vendors? All due to duped gifts. Every time you’re low on caps just open a few until you approach max caps.
---
I have a fairly huge collection of shotguns including things like tse. The best one I have at the moment is a level 15 vampire's extra bash lol. I hope it does get fixed as it's the same sort of glitch that allows people to melt SBQ, which is no fun for anyone else but I can't say I've not taken advantage of it to speed level a toon recently.
---
Here's my worthless opinions about pvp...
---
All your legendary effects should be void in PVP mode. PvP should be based on perk cards and skills. Having legendary equipment with pvp means you're either going to face someone who has more time to grind the game for better stuff, better community connections, or has connections to duping.
---
Second, I firmly believe it's possible to mix a pvp layer on adventure without disrupting others. Certain points on the map can be events similar to monster madness there encourage pvp. Maybe a zone becomes a capture the flag scenario or king of the hill. 
---
You also have hunter/hunted... Why not just let that be a place to enable/disable PvP in general? If you go into that mode it disables everyones blip on the map for you. 
---
So many options. Hope PvP becomes a focus one day.
---
My melee is the ammo supplier for my three other builds. I switch from my melee to heavy Gunner (5mm) for SBQ. All other ammo gets transfered to other  needed characters. Works great.
---
I didn’t even know this event required a card! 
---
What kind of card does it require?
---
It's late, I'm tired, I'm pretty sure you are too, but let's stay civil. I promise I'm not trying to troll you or be a dick.
---
It wouldn't be the only bug that has been around since the game started right?
---
All I'm saying is that both Carnivore and Herbivore specify that you get "2x benefits" from eating the meat/veggie and Zero benefit from eating veggie/meat, respectively. Why wouldn't buffs like carry weight be considered a benefit along with filling the food/drink bar?
---
I haven't done the quest to get it, but is it possible to mod it to use regular fusion cells like in 4? V.A.T.S Unknown would be nice to use if it could.
---
I have the same shotgun and it rocks, take a look angry turtle video on YouTube, "are shotguns secretly op???"
---
Thanks, bookmarking this even though I'm level 35. I have the Excavator Armor already so just gotta mine!
---
Score is supposed to not only be for all game versions but account wide as well. NW players are sadly missing out on the good stuff because of this issue. If you play 76 at all it should count toward your SCORE.
---
&gt; cryptid powercoupling-sound keeps playing after event ends is also still a thing
---
Yes, happened to me too, futher more I was still getting damaged, and died twice, relogin resolved the problem
---
&gt; a new soundbug i encountered is the silenced sound mode that happens when you take damage and hear your heart beat never returns to normal volume until you change the server
---
Can confirm this too. It gives very uncomfortable "deafened" effect
---
This can also happen after transmission (npc radio message)
---
This argument is absurd. Since the introduction of pacifist mode there hasn't been a single way to force PvP on another player through legitimate game mechanics. Every instance of a player not being forced into PvP because of an exploit (all of which have been patched out to my knowledge) was because the player put themselves in a situation where they became open to PvP.
---
You may call it sleazy to use tactics to bait players into putting themselves in those situations, but have you ever stopped to think maybe if there were more ways to easily engage in PvP with other players also interested this would have been less of an issue? Also which is more sleazy, using a low level player as bait or shooting at a low level player because you expect to be able to mow them down? You reap what you sow and I give no sympathy to those that put themselves in these situations and then complain.
---
The only blame the players have for the current state of PvP is all the horrible changes the PvE community have pushed for that the devs have listened to. Ultimately though it's the devs fault for listening to the PvE community instead of working on the actual problems or listening to anything the PvP community has suggested.
---
If it elicits a response from you, imagine how bored you must be. Take this elsewhere please. I wonder if you are the player that did this, you seem to share this entitled asshattery stance.
---
No, it really should not.
---
You ain't "horrible" much worse has been said on this Sub. I was just trying to...i don't know, not have O.P. hurt more than he already was. And sure, this sub can be a bit of a broken record. But i ain't fighting for the sake of fighting you. Look, it's all over and done with, you ain't gonna hear no more from me. I was just attempting to defend someone. No sense in it getting you more riled up. Goodbye, and have a nice night..or day. Whichever may be your case.
---
I knew about the 130/65, but the dr calling on per shot damage makes two shots shite then. Damn
---
Most Zealots weapons are great for the queen.  A lot of Min maxers  love to talk shit about any weapon that isn't bloodied or junkies  but my favorite weapon for the queen is my Zealots ultracite Gatling laser with Prime receiver.
---
I don't understand the part about the damage numbers... When I select a weapon in the pipboy I see the stats. I noticed that a few times when starting the game and read about some bug that the perk cards are sometimes ignored when joining a server. But now it happened without switching servers _and_ after I quit and started again it was still the same.
---
I looked up a few weapon stats in the wiki and to me it seems that it might be a perk card failure. But the 208 damage I once had for the gauss rifle seem a bit too high to me...
---
WELCOME TO APPALACHIA FRESH MEAT
---
I highly recommend looking up builds on YouTube. Feel free to do whatever build you want but i would have at least a general idea of how you plan to play. Stealth sniper is great for a first time character. Does great damage and .308 ammo Is plentifully early levels. 
---
Grab every weapon you come across. Then Scrap all the weapons you are not using. Its how you learn mods to make them and leaves you with quite a bit of junk to use for crafting. 
---
Once you hit level 10 I recommend going up to grafton. Two events their that are pretty easy are grafton day and protest march. Great rewards can be gotten from them. Not to mention the enemies in grafton are pretty great for leveling up. 
---
Read every thing you come across. Listen to every hollow tape. Their is so many stories and interesting lore to read. 
---
Most of all have fun. Your gonna run into jerks now and then but you'll also encounter a lot of great people. 
---
If someone flashes a present emoji don’t run away. Go to them.  A lot of us high level players like to give back to the community. We seek out new players to pass on extra goodies we have. They may also shoot at your feet to show you where the loot bag is.
---
Nah it would be awesome and bring some new and old players in, bugs need to be fixed but many people are never gonna be satisfied by only having repeatable pve content 
---
PvP is a way to keep things fresh, and it's a part of the main game too, just really underdeveloped
---
It's quite complicated. Basically, you gotta get the rusty key that spawns with the blaster, take it to this location in Morgantown I think, take that key to Tanagra Town? Then take that key to this unmarked cave, then that key to this TNT Dome. And all of these locations have literally no connection with each other, I think that the mystery was actually solved via data mining. You've just gotta look up a video on YouTube, I probably got the locations wrong lol
---
Just watch out for those lvl50 anti-armor Gutsies at Garrahan Mining Headquarters. They hurt as hell.
---
the small one can be found at morgantown airport during the overseers holotapes quest. the large one, the one you want to have, is a reward for the [Order of the Tadpole Quest](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_the_Tadpole)
---
Thank you :). I’m happy to see some people being so nice on the game and on this sub, thank you
---
Barely at level 11 playing about an hour a day and its already a chore and I dread playing.
---
Havent been able to pick any of the ghillie skins for NW usage so far (Wood armour &amp; Hunting Rifle)
---
I support this idea!
---
Last weekend I was at The Whitespring, near one of the entrances. A sentry bot was fighting a couple of charred ghouls, one of which was a legendary (even 3 star I think). Legendary goes down first because I was also shooting at it, but then the other ghouls managed to kill the sentry bot. Then they came running to me so I had to deal with them. In the meantime, the sentry bot exploded and launched the legendary corpse to... somewhere. Spent a couple of minutes walking around trying to find it but it was just gone.
---
ITS TIME TO BARBECUE
---
I actually started the tadpole quest after finding some info on the net but it seems like its quite a long quest. Thank you for the help!
---
since it is hard to miss inside morgantown airport: you find a keycard from a dead responder you can reach thru a crack in the wall only. once you have it go back and look for a locked door with a cardreader that leads up some stairs, the backpack plans are in the blue stashbox in the last room upstairs on the right
---
My only guess is that they named it "building" for the whole BoS thing where pretty much the community seems to build the base.
---
Is that so? First of all, i do not think you, or anyone, could tell be what to do with my caps and my game. I never said I expected to finish it without help, I did not grief anyone for not tanking a pylon and I was quite content to just farm the xp and legendaries (got 5 this run). What my issue is, is that this P.o.S. went out of his way to grief me, never tanked a single pylon and expected me to tank all three because I started the event. I can give you his gamer tag, you might get along fine by the looks of it.
---
it is and parts of it are quite annoying also but its definitly worth it. a lvl 50 backpack adds 60 capacity. and if you grind (or buy it for around 10k caps) for the high capacity mod, its 120. i run a stealth commando with 1 STR and have a capacity of 295. definitly worth doing an annoying quest :)
---
Weasel would be great as a camp companion
---
I dont give a crap about pvp which is terrible in F76. I would rather play other game for that.
---
Just save up on gold and buy the SS PA and get the jetpack with it. But if you're inpatient then yeah just buy it.
---
Yes, i thought it was obvious already though, unless there another way of selling and buying stuff without the player vendor...
---
Im not a PA user but diseases dont do anything serious. I 1 shot everything with diseases on myself and without them. The most annoying disease the food and water loss thingy.
---
Please let me know the results, I'd love to have both if I get all the positives and no negatives, but I'd worry they would patch it and I'd be screwed and have to start my mutations from scratch.
---
On that note I wonder if Strange in numbers and/or Class freak would/should effect these. I know they dont effect speed demon and marsupial, which sucks.
---
cat lady's house up above vault tec university.
---
Preach it, my PA brother.
---
cat lady's house up above vtu.
---
I am exactly one day behind. I should be able to finish right? Even if I ignore some of the NW quests?
---
Good for you, still a dumb mechanic that needs to be reworked instead of being shrugged off.
---
Almost all games have a freemium and a premium version. In FO76 you basically get all 100 rewards for free.
---
Yeah post apocalyptic littering simulator
---
&gt; This way all the duped 3 ⭐ weapons will become basically useless 
---
Isn't the point of duplication that they're going to just dupe the next best weapons? Weapon cap could definitely do with being higher though, regardless of wierd reasons.
---
I’m also a day behind. I’d try to do the NW quests, but I assume we are okay. I’m going off of Norespawns’s video. I recommend you watch it. Let me know what you think.
---
My tickets were follow-ups to unresolved issues originally submitted as a ticket on 3 May 2020. That is more than two months ago. With all due respect, saying "with all that's going on right now" is honestly a bit of a cop out considering plenty of other similar companies are able to accommodate the "situation" fairly successfully without even close to this kind of impact to their customers. "There are only so many employees to answer them all" again is inexcusable for the same reason. Even if these kinds of times are "normal" for right now (and that is a big "if"!), any competent organisation would better manage the expectations of their customers by way of COMMUNICATING this delayed reply ETA to them.
---
Bethesda has a whole year to fix this. Honestly they should plant moles in the community to snuff out the dupers.
---
Exactly! And this is on to of me still trying to get max rep with  Crater and Foundation! That's a lot of dailies for not a lot of available time.
---
Aren't we about 200 years too early for Three Dog?
---
I'd love to visit the Capital Wasteland, and as great as it would be to have Three Dog as a radio host again, he  wouldn't be born for about another century since FO3 takes place 125 years after the events of 76.
---
BP is free, what more do you want?
---
IMO Teslas make it easier. They're shiny blue piles of ash that stand out in most places.
---
Meat piles are a little easier in some terrains, and can be easier to find with the flies, though.
---
Play on Xbox and have the same issues especially when using workbenches and doing events
---
Yeah, but it's a really complicated process to get the plan for the fusion cell conversion and doing so makes it a bad laser pistol pretty much.
---
When does Bethesda ever follow the lore? Come on now, maybe we meet the 1st of 3 Dogs?
---
while bloodied is the most popular, don't disregard furious. the extra consecutive shot damage combined with automatic and maxed commando and sneak perks will have you melting through anything that comes your way.
---
Yeah, there's exactly a 0% chance that'll ever work.
---
I like the theory though; how about a virus with fo76 that infects your computer and if it detects superdupes it attacks you like the squids out of the Matrix.
---
please let me give you the four i got last night.
---
Past experience is what drives expectations. The legendarily run replaced the ATOM challenge, it's reasonable to expect the same effort / reward ratio.
---
This dude just gave me a Fixer during Fasnacht. Had no idea what it was since I was like level 10.
---
You think they haven't planted moles?
---
Isn't that literally on the last 10 items of the season? I'm glad I'm not on PC.
---
All good, I think its only 150 years out, we can meet his Grandpa.
---
i tried everything, including unloading all stuff to another char, cant get rid of the lag on my main.
---
he learned basicly every plan in the game
---
on another char i run i intentionally learned no plans, stash is full, many notes items etc but no lag.
---
once you catch it it wont go away it seems and maybe its about learned plans as well, just a guess
---
Back in the early days someone better at the game than me told me to use a Tesla Rifle to just "tickle" the enemies to tag them. In events I'll often take off all my rifle perk cards and shoot each group of enemies once with a Tesla. It's generally a pretty good strategy to share. 
---
Sometimes people think I'm an idiot for being high level and barely doing any damage but I'm trying to be nice, dang it :P
---
Only if someone is struggling or I'm fixing to die, do I super sledge em. :)
---
I think *probably* the Secret Service Ghillie Armor skin.  
---
I might be wrong, though.
---
Seriously though, it's unlocked at SCORE rank 82. Middle right-hand side of the board, and it has a Vault Boy icon.
---
Oh it has its own category.... bugger &amp; it's all the way over to the end :( thx for answering
---
You don't need the mic at first. If you just want to test team voice chat to listen, then if you like it and you want to talk as well you can look into getting a mic. 
---
I have a mic, but rarely speak in voice, if someone says something that I want to respond to then I reply with an emote. I only speak if an emote wont describe what I want to say.
---
Mine isn't fancy. If you have a headset with a mic built in that should be fine. 
---
When you have a mic it is a good idea to use "push to talk" so that you don't broadcast the whole time
---
Whats good? Everything. 
---
Whats bad?   Everything.
---
Haha no worries 😉
---
Truth. My situation was lucky cause the cliff I was around had a long enough view to where I could see anyone coming around it and react by the time they got to me.
---
I didn't make the kill just cause I suck, lolz.
---
They haven't planted moles.
---
Nobody is being paid a wage to find like 4 kids duplicating a month.
---
how has this got anything to do with my question?
---
Strange in Numbers does affect Marsupial. Whenever I'm on a team with someone sharing that my jump heigth, and the "hang time", are hilarious.
---
As for testing, I'll report back once I get around to playing today. Not within reach of my gaming rig. :)
---
a shared stash box would be nice but i doubt that they would boost stash size because... they are just the way they are.
---
they'd probably do one 800lb stash for all chars or something even more useless.
---
this would be a thing that makes me quit the game stash size is ridiculus as is
---
I mean....you can "scorch" metal. Or, like robot brains, maybe all robots have some organic components that can get the scorched disease?
---
If my team mates use the come here emote, I just check on the map where they are. If there is someone with them I wait for a second 'come here' emote before I fast travel.
---
Rara is a brat and needs discipline, buuut she's not my kid and she makes me laugh. So idk love/hate?
---
So your telling me, an outfit that either I sold to a npc vendor or just scrapped it because I didnt want it anymore is a very rare item?
---
Well butter my backside and call me toast
---
Thanks for registering this, I was lowkey worried that I'm missing out on the biggest bonuses by not doing 1 insane run of refreshing stacked 100% bonus
---
Which is exactly why they have MODIS doing it for them.
---
😆
---
Oh man, that reminds me of a time I had a level 29 join my public team the other day. He wnt over to "Feed the people" and I joined a little later after putting together some Level 30 200% Deep Pocketed BOS Heavy Combat set. I drop it and emote with the gift emote. Then this 100+ swoops in and grabs it. I started emoting angry and thumbs down and fortunately he realized the error of his ways and dropped them back down. Keep doing what you do, this is what makes this game and community great.
---
Yeah Id be Ok with her too.
---
Or they could make the PvP better and then it wouldn't be terrible lol
---
I fully agree! I get framedrops under 40 since patch 20... very very annoying!
---
And no its not my PC... (3700x + 5700XT).
---
Pretty sure the exploit people are using is able to be done on console too
---
You mean like in a trade menu?
---
&gt;  but have you ever stopped to think maybe if there were more ways to easily engage in PvP with other players also interested this would have been less of an issue? 
---
Play NW.
---
&gt; Also which is more sleazy, using a low level player as bait or shooting at a low level player because you expect to be able to mow them down?  
---
When that player is follwing you around and meleeing you or shooting you / jumping in front of your bullets trying to get you to shoot him when all you want to do is play the game than yes i think them doing that is more sleazy. your just killing him because you want to be left alone and not trolled.
---
&gt; The only blame the players have for the current state of PvP is all the horrible changes the PvE community have pushed for that the devs have listened to. Ultimately though it's the devs fault for listening to the PvE community instead of working on the actual problems or listening to anything the PvP community has suggested. 
---
The PVP community are a small minority compared to the PVE community. The fact of the matter is the PVP players are not important to the games life cycle, so at that point what they want doesnt really matter.
---
I'm honestly really willing to accept that theory. I mean he's from New Reno, not one honest person has come from New Reno. I find it totally plausible that he just discovered Jet instead of inventing it
---
ToS actually mention that everyone are required to report exploiters/cheaters
---
The daily cap limit
---
The daily scrip limit with scrip cap
---
The daily gold limit
---
Bloodied ffr mini seems to work well on players.,
---
I hope Bethesda do something about this, its not right that people should be rewarded for using glitches, while there will be thousands of legitimate players that can only dream of reaching that far in the legendary run, surely this guy couldn't legitimately be at rank 100 after less than a week?
---
I consider "Scorched" on robots to be just rust.
---
True, i haven noticed the jump height lol, but I more meant the +20 carry weight being increased, which I will need after I respect and lose 5 STR. 5 pounds can mean a lot lol
---
Had to lecture a kid who occasionally hops into our group about this. He's not 100+ yet, but was bragging about a bunch of stuff he picked out of a bag in front of the vault. We eventually got him to go back to the vault and put it back into the bag.
---
Wait... we might be getting a new map? for real?
---
MODIS the cybersecurity, tech and data analysers are now secret moles designed and paid to unsuccessfully find 12 year olds with nothing better to do?
---
Your brain's doing some crazy stuff, man.
---
Ain’t one wasteland gonna fix the difficulty gap?
---
I think somewhere between 40 and 50 is legitimately achievable if you invest a LOT of time. There was someone who posted about reaching level 30 like 2 days ago. 10 hours a day, or something.
---
Level 100, however, is impossible without using exploits.
---
Don't need to fix issues if no tickets are issued \*point to forehead meme\*
---
Sorry about that. I sent a message saying that there were multiple people on Steam with the username you said, but never heard back. Figured you were busy with something, lol.
---
That works for me too, i just like the sinister implications of all booths being semi organic
---
Either would be perfect. They can expand the map north of crater, or either use the mezzanine at top of the world, or a vault underneath it
---
The xp glitch works on all platforms.
---
His grandfather One Dog is the current radio host
---
One Dog, the original wasteland Dj
---
I feel like it was a free item awhile back in the atomic shop- Mines missing as well. Now I’m waving at people like some sort of idiot. I want to salute!
---
Awesome. I hit 900 for the first time today. Belvc fixer. Exciting. I need ballistic bock. I was using overdrive and psychotats
---
&gt; I just said that they didn't.
---
They did, or people wouldn't have complained about it all over forums and have made mods to reduce or eliminate the drain.
---
&gt; You only needed all three levels of the Nuclear physicist perk.
---
You're arguing that they didn't drain FCs fast because you invested the levels, lntelligence score, and perk points into making them drain slower. You are literally arguing that it was fast enough to need a perk for it. The drain in Fallout 4 is fast, and needs a perk to make it slow. The drain in Fallout 76 is fast, and needs a perk to make it slow. The question is wether the drain is faster in 76 than in 4, and that is answered objectively with numbers from 1:1 side-by-side testing, not with subjective experience.
---
Perhaps jetpacks do drain cores faster in 76 than in Fallout 4. Maybe Vats and sprinting does too.  Maybe that's intentional because in 76 cores are even easier to farm thanks to the fusion core generators at power plants. Maybe there's a bug that jetpacks are ignoring the double duration perk. Maybe it's just perception and there is no difference.
---
So many times people have said suddenly their food/water meters felt like they drained much faster, that the Speed Demon mutation was draining them faster while they were standing still, or their weapons and armor broke faster than they used to. I've felt so myself several times, but each time I've tested, such as timing the water meter while not moving, I proved it just felt different and nothing had actually changed.
---
I missed several days of dailies myself and have been grinding at a bit of a more bogged down pace than that group and am at 50 currently.  If anyone was grinding as or more harder than myself, such as taking shifts on the same account, then I could easily see them being in the 70s or 80s now.
---
Should've recorded a clip of it and reported the guy. Shit like this shouldn't go unpunished.
---
It's utterly variable.
---
I'm playing melee build now and I must say - what a freedom! No lead, no acid, no steel, no ammo problems! And what is the best - I sell all that lead and ammo that I don't need at my vending machines, earning some serious caps! 
---
And all legendary melee weapons other players sell so cheap compared to ranged! Melee builds are the best!
---
The handful of PVP players I've encountered in PVE here have been the worst examples of humans beings. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if these creeps were serial killers held back only by their inability to leave their parents basements.
---
lol, I feel that, I never know the rarity of all the outfits in the game. I could be hitting the jackpot without even knowing it.  Maybe a nice QoL, Bethesda could add rarity colours or stars to them.
---
Pick up 180 junk items and the keys will respawn.
---
Eastern penitentiary is good for that too. But the best part in Camden park, I always did that when I logged on because in your server hopping you can also sell all the weapons you get there to the vendor to max out your caps. Also all the junk on the ground gives you a bunch of cloth.
---
I bet you still bought it though lmao
---
It should encompasses all ammo types and have a better conversion rate too, 90 gamma rounds are not worth 14 .45 rounds, feel like I gotta totally gypt on that, bet they make abetter one later that you actually have to buy or its given to 1st members exclusively
---
You need a piece of armor with a magic effect or a gauss shotgun with a magic effect and then use only VATS. 1 shot EVERYTHING.
---
Sounds like people are really getting bad luck with players. I normally have a good violent night event. I don't use power armor, so I play music and let the others protect me. I play music until the red flashes at the end starts and normally people wait for me to get the night caller as well.
---
Sometimes you get someone that one-shots it, in that case I just emote thumbs down and move on with my game
---
This is an excuse used by players who can't aim. If you can't hit a target moving up and down, you can't hit a target moving left, right, or otherwise.
---
Lately I've been thinking of all that good weapons I've scrapped for scrip when I could've sold them for alot of caps
---
The worst is when you fight a diseased scorch beast or mirelurk king.
---
Prepare to have a disease screamed into you....
---
Yay.
---
Yes, yes a thousand times yes!
---
Damn I play F76 PvP since beta and never encountered such a sick person.
---
 It's kinda funny tho, what that he expect when getting a bounty?... Seemingly he didn't expect a player to slay him...
---
The gods have answered my prays. A help tip and way to find lead for ammo. The amount of runs I did with character only using bows to save up on ammo just to have it all gone again around lvl 40 is frustrating but this is super helpful now and I’m definitely spending this week just constantly grinding for lead all day everyday.
---
I've had pretty decent Experiences in there.  The only issue I've had is when there is multiple groups,  the legendary at the end will spawn at a random camp area.  If it's not near or close to where you are when it spawns,  by the time you locate it n try to get there... its dead,  no drops
---
Now everything has a magic effect? Care to enlighten us, cause last I checked only heavy guns had it.
---
I don't think it's an oversight. The ghillie suit which was unlockable with a NW challenge a while back is an outfit, you can't wear armor with it. You can either have camo or damage resistance, probably not both.  By that logic, it makes sense the ghillie armor can't be used in NW.
---
There is of course camo on the scout armor, but it's not nearly as effective.
---
I don't think that CF has an impact on buffs but that should be easy enough to test. :)
---
You monster its a child
---
And the armco ammo machine should include 2mm EC
---
I got one from it’s a trap in the ash heap
---
It says you have to pay, but it doesn't actually cost you
---
That is such a good idea! :O 
---
Gotta try it tonight!
---
There is so much wrong with it but let's start with the obvious one, you use the wrong melee perks for unarmed, you need iron fists for that.
---
come over to my vendor then and see for yourself
---
She's at least safe, in a fortified settlements surrounded by armed raiders
---
fallout was never an online game. they tried with nuclear winter, thanks I'll pass.
---
No you got it backwards. They do correct damage outside of vats and bugged and unintended amounts of  damage in vats. All shotguns are bugged this way. And many other ways.
---
*The end is just the beginning :)*
---
The assualtron recall card, it can be bought for around 1800cap (I think) at vendors.
---
I have a 1* Junkies one, still hits like a truck.
---
Junkie faster fire rate would be the best for both because of the bug increases your damages a lot
---
Ok, I'll bite.
---
What?
---
So spam ‘collect’ after you’ve pressed the little drinking bar thing and it gives a shit ton.. I don’t know how I found this out I think someone mentioned it with the water well
---
Agreed. Sometimes I will sell something during a loading screen so I don't know I sold anything at all until the next time I look at my caps. I've gotten close to maxing out before because of this.
---
events like uranium fever drops loads of shotguns and gauntlets. I always pick up all of it. Either scrap it for steel or walk to the train station and sell the weapons + flesh + radaway for about 60% of the daily vendor cap.
---
i noticed more players participating in paradise as well, but most clutter around in one habitat, i usually solo another habitat then. i think it has more to do with people not realizing that more habitats means better reward than anything else.
---
and sadly every 3rd paradise ot so has the old lag that was "fixed" in paradise and the vaultraids a few patches ago
---
It switches back and forth on relogging/fast travelling. Annoying, but most of the time it looks as intended for me.
---
Aight you do you, I think it could be great so I'll keep holding out for a better PvP experience
---
When I made a new character for wastlanders it felt good getting some help in return. Not that I feel I deserved it or anything. I was proud, I felt that I played a small part in creating this tradition.
---
You call that a mess? Before the wastelanders update that place was a ghost town. At least now people are joining in events like that even if they do just sit there.
---
Much better experience on this event then what I had before.
---
Or what if you replace barely clean water with super clean fresh unopened canned water for better meals? Its a new and revolutionary idea nobody thought abiut and its completely free! No traveling around everywhere.
---
Thought my game was broke and build wasent working glad im not alone! Annoys me so much when im a PA heavy hitter type build aswell!
---
Switching audio devices requires a restart, no matter the connection type.
---
This is literally the only game I have that "works" like this.
---
I don’t know what your build looks like, but stashing some Nuka quantums and using cola nut is an easy way to solo the event while bloody.  I’ll use 5-7 and put the impostor down in about a minute with a crit chain.  It’s not that difficult if you stay hidden, but not the most efficient way to gain xp.
---
Why is encryptid so much more difficult than any other event.  each time I’ve tried I get wiped over and over. Last few times even with many others in the event.  I cant even get past a single pylon without a quick death.  I’m no hard core player so I’m sure I don’t have the strategy right but damn it seems very unforgiving.
---
Alternatively, if you can live without the extra 9% DR reduction from tenderizer, you can just go with Inspirational 3.
---
I'd love a few quality of life items for my camp and this is one of them
---
They will find a way to mess it up. They will require you to buy fallout ++ to put down any useful camp items such as any sort of water source or plants and you cant use stairs or power unless you have fallout ++ which needs fallout +
---
The Watoga high school has loads of plastic too. Plastic plates and cutlery all over the place. It's a decent spot to farm the stuff if you're hard up for it.
---
"It just works."
---
CF is supposed to effect Empath by reducing the damage taken debuff from what I understand. I hope it's fixed with this patch, cuz running it would help.
---
And for the Marsupial carry weight buff it would be SiN that would increase it. I know I saw a pretty patch 20 comparison of all mutations with and without CF3, but maybe the patch changed how CF and SiN effects mutations. I know Herd mentality is different/better with the patch, at least with how Pub teams effect it.
---
project paradise is one of my favourite events, but whenever i succeed that events its usually cuz the whole server protects 1 animal and leaves the rest for dead
---
That NPC spawn is due an exploit.
---
Some dudes just think they are smart when they place their tent in a specific place  so the game just spawn all npcs in the center. This ruins all the feeling of this event.
---
You know you can just hit h on pc right?
---
PC and Xbox get different games.
---
Hate to break this to you buddy, but consoles have the same glitches/exploits as pc does.
---
With or without the ivory grip?
---
I made a post suggesting this a few days ago
---
Thanks man I’ll try it
---
Nuclear Winter is an entirely different type of PvP. Stop trying to use this argument.
---
Your example doesn't change the fact that it's still on the player that took the bait. You can turn on pacifist and never have to worry about accidentally starting PvP with someone who keeps hitting your character. If it's that annoying letting someone waste their time and ammo trying to get you to fight them you can block them and change servers and not have to deal with them. Hell, blocking them and fast traveling away is usually enough to get away since they won't be able to see you on the map. You're not going to convince me that starting PvP because you want to avoid a troll is a better option than the methods I suggested.
---
Saying that the PvP community is small and doesn't matter is fucked up and just goes to show this really isn't the "nicest online community" like everyone here likes to tout. Why shouldn't the game be made better for everyone? The PvP community isn't asking for the opportunity to free kill whoever they want. We just want to be able to utilize a feature that the devs said would be in the game since the announcement. Just because we are the minority doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to have a middle ground, especially when no one has to lose out or give up anything from it. Would it actually hurt the game to give PvP players something fun to do?
---
Me and my buddies can do it with just us 3, them two are a bloodied build and I specifically have a set of t65 (any pa will do) and a vampires gat plasma so I go and get all 3 pylons then just lay into the imposter to stay alive and them two blitz her.
---
Aslong as you have someone with a vampires heavy weapon you’ll walk through it :)
---
Console. The Devs stated in an interview that the 76 player base was mostly on console, which is why PC-oriented features such as text chat were not invested in. The launch on Steam may have evened that out a bit, but the Steam player base died off quickly.
---
You are not paranoid. You are overreacting a bit though.
---
You did ok telling them to F off and yes they were being complete pricks.
---
So Herd Mentality works even if teammates are not nearby? The mutations description says: “When your teammates are nearby, all specials increase. When your teammates are not nearby, all specials are reduced.”
---
Just 17 but i‘m only in for the chicken coop so that’s ok I guess.
---
Doing this event on public world is always dissappointing. There are just way too many ways for others to F it up. It is a shame because this could be one of the best events out there.
---
Only solution is to do it on private world with at least 4 friends. Then the event becomes very easy with a close to 100% succes rate. I wish it was different but I suspect our group isn't the only group that looks at it like that.
---
1500 atoms in total rewards
---
Could also work for other things. I'm one cap short to buy something can we make a deal? I need item you're selling for my other character please accept my friend invite. Will pay for you to build in my camp.
---
There is no AFK time-out.
---
They didn't break it, they expanded it with more information we didn't know.
---
You can always find a squirrel at Whitespring Service Entrance. Use Butcher's Bounty
---
Personally, I play melee for this reason. I could never be bothered to feed the beast. 
---
Still a great PSA.
---
No. Lets fight with rapiers right now.
---
Can you even trade them?
---
Boo fucking hoo, imagine crying on the internet.
---
How you put those icons near the loot?
---
1 more week of Bethesda not doing anything about exploiters and all of them will be able to go under the radar since ranks will be purchasable from then on. No one will be able to tell the difference.
---
If any other mmo with integrity had a major exploit like this in the wild they'd turn off the servers for emergency maintenance immediately and actually fix the issue. But here we might at best hope that they can partially address it in the next major patch whenever that is.
---
I think b/33 would be better for the shotty
---
Herd Mentality is great. Not to keen on testing Empath. The debuff is insane.
---
Glad this helps
---
Good grief you really are salty, just trying to help 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
I use a bloodied 33 vats chance plus 40 bashing damage, it literally melts the queen and imposter sheepsquatch even if my health isn’t that low
---
When it comes to group events opinions are like arseholes, everyone has one.
---
I’m not going to change my big gun build mid event because you want to bash shit in radiation rumble, especially when we have only one pleb left. Someone took the time to follow me doing “Shakey head” emote at me. 
---
I will be using my big gun against the queen. Again someone level 52 with a sniper rifle constant “shakey head” emoji throughout the battle.
---
I try to shoot legendaries once and emote others to come, if the next guy empties his wad of explosive shotgun at it, don’t assume I annihilated it because I’m of a higher level. 
---
I don’t start others cryptid and I will do my fair share of pylons but I’m not going to do it all while you hide on a roof &amp; farm the spoils, I will, and have, walked away mid event.
---
If you camp in a hole on Uranium  fever to take all the legendaries I will camp in front of you and emote call others to “your” hole.
---
Someone messaged me the other day to ask “is it okay if I take one of the other Core workshops?” I had just taken one, no-one around me at the time, I had also fixed the power station first. I responded “sure” curious why they would ask. They then responded “‘cause I was just gonna steal yours but luckily for you I thought otherwise”. Checked the guys level, 1051. Kept an eye on the map Berty Big Balls didn’t take another workshop. What was the point in that message??
---
I’m a player now of a level that legendary drops are more of an issue than a benefit. I will help whoever needs it because I am over resourced. My vendor prices are all 1Cap. I try to be considerate, but there’s always going to be people who take this far too seriously.
---
There are some weird people on this game.
---
When I need to do that I usually start at Camden Park. Kill the few enemies and loot everything including all the trash cups, trays, blocks, toys, stuffed bears, basketballs, the middle region with the power armor stand.  You’ll get close to or exceed that 180 pretty fast.
---
Maybe Threedogs granddad was an amateur Radio enthusiast  named Juan but he had a speech impediment (which he used DJing to get over), so when his first callin listener asked what his name was, he said "my names Juan, dog" and it just became a unintentional Handle that he just went with and his son and grandson went along with it like being called Junior or " the 3rd"
---
This is now canon.
---
I don’t know why you’re getting so upset by it. They’ve literally spoilt all the fun of the roadmap. I’ve loved logging and and doing the extra challenges. Played NW which I’d never normally do and it’s so much fun. But don’t think I’d bother without the challenge. Now they’ve taken away an extra thing to do each day.
---
Thanks for the advice, very helpful 👍
---
No you don’t, bash damage and vats hit chance are both major prefixes
---
This type of stuff been going up, people get mean you if don’t sell something at price they want, even though I sell my stuff a little bit cheaper then others. They start attacking my base but I usually just leave the game then join a other server.
---
8 wish the mothman cultists were more mysterious and not so bat shit crazy.  I mean, whoever worships a giant moth would be crazy.  But would be nice to learn about their missions and lore.
---
&gt; Saying that the PvP community is small and doesn't matter is fucked up and just goes to show this really isn't the "nicest online community" like everyone here likes to tout. 
---
look man i never said it wasnt fucked up. However its the reality of the situation and sometimes the truth hurts. Now you and all the other PVP players can take that information and continue to try and make PVP great again but it will all be a waste of time. The optimal thing to do is go play another game that will respect your time with better PVP game modes/Mechanics. The way this game is designed/ the mechanics implemented, its just not for PVP players and its probably never going to be.
---
Charred ferals are why I have a flamer in my inventory. Demands close combat, but even without any perk cards for it, it eats through a herd of them pretty quick. They're also pretty handy for some of the robots.
---
😂 I like it.
---
Yes, I did that earlier in the game for the XP too. But when you're above level 500, you don't need those 3 vertibots anymore. So I spare them for other players.
---
not salty, just saying this has nothing to do with my question, we can load it just fine, just looking for how i invite a friend to my session or i join him
---
Sucks you had to deal with toxicity man.. you’d be surprised a bloodied build can activate all 3 pylons and solo it, I’ve done it a few times now with my current bloodied stealth commando build, all you really need is some nuka quantum’s and to use rank 2 of cola nut (or cooked scorchbeast meat with carnivore) 
---
I’ve found it a lot easier to do it by myself than have people running around causing me to loose sneak damage
---
Yeah it probably would be for a bit extra damage. I still personally would rather Junkies as I run a full health build and like two pvp. But if you're just going for raw damage then yeah B/33% vats hit chance would be the better option
---
And they're also most likely contributing to the slow performance in the menus.
---
Nigga what the fuck
---
I tried to do this, but I got taken right into my base. Just a little cave near robco research.
---
The trouble is you need 3 alive to get any decent chance at the rare plan drops and I really want the Stimpak Diffuser plan. I was hoping initially thered be some good chances at it now but its gone back to the same bullshit for me except maybe there is more people present
---
I've been trying to get that recently... Maybe 2022 ha ha Does it look good without the wrapped hat?
---
I've never managed to complete this event.
---
Also, what are the cards? I see them, but dont actually know what they are or what they do?
---
I wouldn't say replace.  This punishes lower level players and puts a limit on how much of the items you can make since you can only gather purified water so fast.  You can just keep making boiled water if you have the wood.  
---
I would love the option though to use purified maybe for a lower rad food, or to turn purified water into boiled water.
---
Toxicity centered around PVP in a video game?  BAFFLED YOU SAY?
---
First day on the internet?
---
I thought such behaviour was breaking Bethesda's TOS and was taken very seriously?
---
If CF and SiN both effect it in the way that I thought then of a 2 person team are both running it and both have Cf3 and SiN each would get a damage increase taken of 33% and a damage taken reduction of 25%, which would in turn be after the perks would be, approximately, an increase to damage taken by 8.25%(33%x.25) and a 37.5(25%x1.25) damage taken Reduction 37.5-8.25 would still be about a 29% damage taken decrease. But its 5am and in sleep deprived so I my math could be wonky
---
There may be more people but that doesnt help much when it comes to getting the rare drops that are dependant on objectives being met.
---
Me too normally, in fact most events go pretty okay. The one's that fail to complete stand out from the norm. I don't remember when everything goes great, they all kinda blur together.
---
The one shotting legendaries happens, hell I've done it myself before (by accident) but I'm less and less bothered by this these days as chances are it's just more scrip and I don't need more of that.
---
Fellow musician here. I am drooling over both the Quantum Armor (which in 4, it took me ages to find in Nuka World) and the beautiful work on the guitar.
---
Huzzah, ANOTHER PLAYER WHO KNOWS ABOUT THIS BS! Yes! I agree with you 100%! I have to waste a point for the Vaccination perk to decrease the chance of getting infected. I only use Antibiotics to get rid of them. Also, the fact with diseased glowing Mole Rats that get you with the first bite &amp; dig underground &amp; can somehow burrow up through rock or cement cause that TOTALLY makes sense! I also use PA. Honestly, it should reduce your chance of getting infected if not fully make you immune.
---
I think I've never contracted Snot Ear. No idea why. I fought dozens of snallygastes, but I never got the disease.
---
But it is nonsense, sure. And also a useless waste of Disease Cure and Antibiotics.
---
OK understand, I hope you find a solution.
---
It's so much less effort to conserve ammo at lower levels by relying more on melee weapons (even if you're not a melee build) and using not your main ranged weapon with different ammo e.g. Using 10mm pistol or 308 hunting rifle to save .45 or 5.55 ammo.
---
I don’t need the XP, but I do need the big boom :D
---
It’s also pretty demoralising coming across three vertibirds but no nuke card.
---
God, I wish a keychain existed in this game. Idk why they got rid of it in FO4 &amp; here. It's such a good feature! Kept your MISC clean.
---
You’re right I just looked, it’s actually 40% bash damage and my AP fills 15% faster, I got it mixed up with my .50 cal. That thing shreds though
---
Don't normalize this shit.
---
Hope i can Get One soon 😬
---
I agree, that shit is totally uncalled for. 100% should report it.
---
I quit the game because lack of ammo and vendors were disabled forever. It's too much effort to get something so basic...
---
If you message me your GT I'll put a starter bundle together for you of some lower level weapons, armour and Stimpaks.
---
Played since Beta. Never found a player like this.
---
Only people who would lead mobs against other people in events.
---
Have you already blocked and reported this guy?
---
It's 2k. There's 10 lots of 150 throughout and the bundle for rank 100 gives another 500.
---
Got a quad 33 rw gauss shotty this morning, just wish it was bloodied :s
---
Yes, that's a bit true... that's why I mostly do this in low level areas. 
---
People who want cards can get the locations in the Whitespring.
---
Sadly this. Remember you can swap perks out at anytime, so you don't need 11 intelligence to have both weapon artisan and makeshift warrior together, and you may want 3 perception so you can pick master locks. Lone wanderer is pointless now that we can join public teams for better benefits. Field surgeon sounds good, but realistically if you are taking so much damage you need faster healing then you are already dead, a better strategy is to fall back, maybe using escape artist to pause the fight. With endgame armor you don't need 5 points in endurance for a little extra damage resistance, and 3 points for adamantium skeleton is expensive considering a single stimpack will repair your rarely broken limbs.
---
Sorry to be critical, lots of perks on this game aren't intuitive so you learn how to use them with a little experience. Fortunately it is super easy to Respec a character, so test things out, but don't stay too committed to this build.
---
This.  Although Beth already have RRP prices, they apparently mean shit.
---
Its why I dont even bother trying partake in the game's 'economy'.  I usually just knock a chunk of the retail price and be done with it.
---
I see threads talking about prices essentially telling me i'm overcharging and an idiot or undercharging and an idiot.
---
Meh.  I aint pulling out a fucking excel sheet of the player economy that i can only update by visiting one specific but unknown player on a random server who really knows what i should be buying/selling for.  Shit, i aint pulling out an excel sheet full stop.
---
Visit my store, laugh at my overpriced 3\* vampire ghillie arm piece or snap up my ultra rare radioactive tiramisu recipe for 50 caps; more power to you.
---
The majority shouldn't be able to finish it but at the same time it can't be oppressive to the point that it's near impossible unless you grind hours everyday without fail.
---
Remember the idea of a battle pass came from free to play game. Thus is NOT a free to play game, so expectations should be a little easier for more to be able to earn the Max rank perks without paying extra.
---
I don't know why, but it is still fast for me still with a ton of items at level 500+.
---
I wish more people played NW on ps4 so maybe I could actually complete some challenges
---
I don't know what I did to get this bug, but now there's like a 70% chance that my notification sfx is replaced by various little 3 note snippets of the standing bass guitar music. It's like bizzaro Seinfeld every time anything happens. Been like this since the patch. 
---
Please don't patch this out lol.
---
Are you friends with sexy hand games?? Lucky!
---
People are salty you’re sharing NW tips because most of these pricks just camp in a bush. Fixed your downvote.
---
Either PA filters out environmental shit or it doesn't. Pick a lane.
---
I'm also open to getting disease from attacks since some attacks will invariably pierce the armour. But that chance should be considerably lower.
---
It should be able to produce Fusion Cores as well, but it should only be able to hold one and produce 1 in 30-40 minutes.
---
I had an interesting situation on encryptid, I had be messing around with perk cards and jumped to the event......so, the card I left on was last laugh, I had 6 orbital strikes on me, it all get a little confusing for everyone
---
Cause of that reason I stopped doing this at events or if anyone else is around.
---
If it’s ‚crowded‘ my way to go lately is to send a team invite to spot the low lvl camp, FT and leave a present with a msg.
---
But then you get the asshats that will jump all over the place with ground pounder, thus negating the need to aim with sights or that new fangled Gauss shotgun, negating the need to aim at all.
---
I refuse to do it. If that game mode can't sustain itself, it should either be worked on continuously like all BR games or dropped altogether.
---
Like in the Fallout 4 Honest Trailer: ...in a post-apocalyptic version of Hoarders!
---
Thanks im gonna check it out next time im on
---
Sorry! I understand it wrong.
---
The experience yesterday was pretty disheartening. I know it's only an event, but this community is the best I have the opportunity to enjoy and this kind of behaviour made me sad.
---
Damn that thing looks so cool lol
---
I have my camp in a nice spot. It’s pretty much on top of a nuke silo, it’s central to everything on the map, I get acid, it’s rarely attacked, I have water and I can grow crops. It’s also on the nuke card bot route. I regularly get nuke cards just fly by. I have 30.
---
Conceptually I like the idea of fishing in the game, but I also cant really picture what it would actually add to the game
---
I realized that in needs minimal obstructions on the LOF to make 95% a miss. if YOU can see the target through your irons or scope doesnt mean that your line of fire "can see" the target too.
---
To be devils advocate wouldnt hurt you too much to grab one isnt too bad ;) but yeah pretty toxic to be honest if they didn't at least help by getting other ones
---
Recently I found an awesome trap camp, and ended up in PVP with the owner despite it being really well made because, well, if you run a trap camp you're asking for it. Anyway once we stopped killing each other we had a note war and it was one of my favorite in game moments ever. I dropped "What's that smell?" He dropped "you've been insulted", I dropped "your the dumbass" and he dropped me a calmex. It continued from there. It was amazing. While I'd love to write things myself, I'd hate to lose out on these moments.
---
I have 5, but I constantly keep nuking for the flux.
---
Is it possible that you're east of the Top of the World?
---
Level 145 and I've never heard anyone rage in this game
---
Lmao
---
Makes me want to build a replica in Appalachia.
---
I don't mind that NW challenges exist but achievabilty should be calculated based on adventure alone. NW stuff should just be a bonus. If you opt in, that's cool. If not, you're not punished for it.
---
Mr. New. Vegas.
---
No I mean you're not going to be \*selling\* it for that price, you are listing it for that... Just having fun hence the :)
---
I'll try BR that's a good shout!
---
yeah, true, you might get thirsty or so. you never know.
---
If you drink and spam collect you can get as much as you can from a river whilst the animation is still going.
---
First question - low health (bloodied/unyielding) build or not?
---
But independent from that, both Barbarian and Ironclad are bad unless you like running around naked. Hint: don't.
---
Gladiator is the wrong perk, you want Iron Fists for Unarmed.
---
And what's with Action Boy/Marathoner? Melee VATS seems kinda pointless to me, so the only use you'd have for the additional AP from Action Boy is more sprinting. Do you really run around that much?
---
Pharma Farma is plain unnecessary.
---
Adrenaline, while generally good in a damage/perk point way, is currently broken. And apart from that I question its usefulness in an unarmed build: if you can maintain the kill streak, why do you need the extra damage? Weapon builds at least have the excuse of conserving ammo...
---
Don't permanently equip crafting perks like Weapon Artisan - swap them in only when you need to do some crafting/repairing.
---
This is amazing and I hope to see it someday
---
Nice, I'm hoping to unlock the jack o lantern skin today, though I'm happy with just the stuff I've unlocked sofar.
---
^SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
^It’s ^already ^hard ^enough ^to ^place ^my ^camp ^as ^it ^is
---
Im a long way from it. I had a horror run today. Took me way longer to get 30 mins in than it should have. Hopefully it doesnt get hotfixed but if it does it does. Im happy with what Ive got
---
I actually loaded up on radaways and did grab one to see how eager this guy was. I actually tanked 2 and this guy did nothing. He expected me to tank everything I guess.
---
Yeah the jack o lantern was the main one I wmated. Then I figured I was close enough and the beanie looked neat haha
---
I have my chinese stealth suit hotkeyed just for this...
---
Oh, I know, I'm saying I wish I could do that with the sink too. I get that the water pump would be slow, but the sink should let me collect water quickly.
---
Happy cake day btw!
---
Yeah Im a pretty good Bush wookie. Took me less than 2 matches. The second match I was in the top 2 until the circle closed lol
---
Never got into NV, so I do t have the same nostalgia for him as I do 3dog
---
I love emoting help while someone tries to fight me... Not sure they get it but whatever. I'll also try to kill any wanted person I see and steal their junk -- shouldn't have got wanted if you can't deal with the repercussions (and yeah I know it can be done inadvertently, but hey.. picking someone's camp lock is still suspect behaviour!).
---
Bro, just yesterday I legitimately had to SWITCH my build mid fight to a full health one (subpar since I didn't have all the armor pieces) to activate pylons since NOONE else was willing to do it and I needed the treasury notes. I'm usually a Vanguard build, I switched to unyielding for the INT boost and get more xp for the legendary run, so I was used to activating pylons, I just never noticed I was literally the only one doing it.
---
You guys owe me a fair amount of stims ya know.

A paella and sushi grind
---
The gifts are totally duped but so many people have them. You will not be banned for them. Imagine how many these people have if they can drop 145 to strangers for no reason. If they're not getting banned, you won't either. The caps from them are pretty nice but most of the plans are garbage and hardly even sellable. Just enjoy them.
---
The one cap for ammo has really helped me.
---
I bought 999 .50 ammo last night and now I don't need to worry about that gun.
---
The quicker you can get a tinker station the better.
---
Crafting ammo is handy.
---
Also what I'm now doing is crafting bulk junk.
---
Selling the bulk junk to the bot at flatwoods is funding my ammo purchases from other players.
---
The first time this challenge came up I got it in 2 matches too but I couldnt do anything right today.
---
Not even arguing, block button the nazi muffin.
---
There are fish in the water., and i found what looked like a large fresh fish carcass on the side of the river. Had a huge bite taken out of it.
---
I think they're confusing an actual cranberry plant with that pink tree that looks like the cranberry bog trees.
---
Where do I go to buy ammo for one cap? I haven't seen that yet.
---
Thanks for the tip :).. And you usually find some squirrel meat at Toxic Larry\`s :)
---
Jeez, is there a perk in Agility that isn't broken? Please, let me know.
---
Did they fix the troughs not accepting the items?
---
I'm pretty much just gonna rock the Ghillie suit, which I unlocked during the original event, so all other skins are moot for now. At least until I get the SS armor and ghillie skin. I just like how the jack o lantern skin looks enough to spark my completionist mentality
---
Yeah after the mole miner hunt I have boatloads of those battle bot cards and I can't do shit with them. 
---
You should be able to destroy/drop stuff you don't want, even quest items. Just mark them with a "This is a quest item, are you really, really sure you want to get rid" confirm button screen, and job done.
---
The inventory management in this game is bloody awful. We've had keychains and stuff before, how freaking hard can it be to re-implement them?. Not to mention all the other QOL stuff this game is desperate for. 
---
If Beth implemented what modders fixed for Fo3/4 it would go a long way towards keeping players happy.
---
I would be nice if we just had the universal option to use dirty, boiled or, purified water with rads scaling to what you used. Water is water after all lol
---
No only that, but given the talk of the removal of some of the hunger and thirst dynamics, I'm guessing Bethesda thought that the mutations would be a little bit pointless if they didn't apply to the buffs.
---
I have been infected from stealth in the stealth suit while a diseases creature was attacking someone in power armor nearbye. The creature did not hit me or target me but I was still infected. Sometimes if they just get close enough while completely hidden and they are passive you still get infected.
---
It's A LOT  better than it used to be as the spawns for A &amp; C are significantly more reliable and the lag during pick up is much better in B.
---
As of now I can run room the deer room alone and kill the Sheepsquatch(it's not too difficult), if people show up; great and if they don't it's no big loss as it just means more XP for me(I get around  20k XP).
---
Here's some advice if people show up(if no one does just do the deer room alone):
---
Wait a few minutes to start.
---
try to organize on voice coms.
---
make sure turrets are repaired, especially if you struggle with the alphas as they sometimes will agro the turrets instead of allied animals. 
---
if lots of people are there but with no organization, prioritize the kelp room, people tend to shy away from it but be ready to body block as it's the toughest to keep alive.
---
DO NOT wait to kill legendarys, sure its a faux pas normally but they can distract other players , slow down harvesting or hurt the allies.
---
People say that if you want the backpack you have to do the shutdown code(I got mine awhile ago and don't remember), and you should assume that it's  your job if you want it.
---
Pretty sure cooldown is server based lmfao
---
So a casual new player will have to spend months with one of the most boring grinds to access new dlc?  That will go over well
---
Happy cake day!
---
Godamnit Turtle, showing us once again that this game is broken as fuck. Really? Armor buffs shotguns? Who the fuck broke that?
---
Very good point! Didn't think of that. I'm not a fan of hunger and thirst negative affects, but I think it's a bit odd to take them out now. They make sense, and are easy to keep on top of.
---
I wonder if they'll change anything with the water/hunger loss diseases.
---
With that attitude it sure as hell won't be. There have been tons of great suggestions, some that would take very little effort to implement. If the PvE player base didn't shoot down every idea that would improve PvP for both groups maybe we could all be happy. You don't have to like PvP to support ideas that make it better for the players that do.
---
I enjoy 76, not just for the PvP. I would just like it if Bethesda didn't abandon a feature I enjoy just because they don't want to listen to players that actually have an idea on how to make it better.
---
I get it. Sometimes you just have bad luck
---
That's the exact opposite of safe, though.
---
Why isn’t it 10 hours?!
---
I just started a stealth toon that's got a full heavy combat set and a combat rifle so figured I'd get it for him haha
---
How do you even go through 75 diluted stimpacks. You should review your tactic. That's way too much
---
They do but they have to get reported or they have no idea about it
---
Ok damn. Now I want fishing JUST so I can make one piece of sushi to put in a Thanksgiving display case next to my Perfectly preserved pie behind Becketts bar. 
---
Though considering the amount of semi aquatic creatures that exist already, having a walking eel or flying fish creature would be simpler, and wouldn't trigger my irrational fear of water.
---
Don’t underestimate the perk Luck of the Draw. It will not offset the durability loss, but you’ll definitely hold out longer than before. Couple it with Gunsmith 5, but that’s about it then. The rest is up to high durability weapon mods.
---
She's safe from Appalachian monsters like deathclaws, scorched, ghouls, etc. She has a super mutant bodyguard too.
---
I have automatic railway rifle with quadruple ammo capacity legendary effect (40 rounds), when i shot in SBQ with 95% i miss 40 round in row. And its normal for this game.
---
Man's a genius
---
Yeah that's bang out of order what a douche, especially when you were nice enough to start it and grab one hes entitled to jack squat
---
Tbh I find it easier to just take all three AND do the damage. If you die, no big deal just do it again. Bring a fast firing vampire weapon.
---
Hot take: Flamethrower 
---
There’s no effective fire resistance, so they literally melt before you.
---
aw fair enough, lets hope a desperate one comes
---
I believe I did similar with this outfit but very early on.
---
For battle bot you don't have to loot the key cards every time, the ones you already have will work.  still cant drop the other 50 though :(
---
All events need an overhaul, especially Project Paradise. They haven't been looked at in how long now? How XP is rewarded and rewards themselves need rebalance for all events. I think Bethesda mentioned something about looking into these issues but when they say something I don't know what that means and I suspect neither do they.
---
I gotcha. I've always been a stealth/overly cautious player, so the ghillie was a must, especially when I Bushwookie in NW for dailies like yesterday's. I do have a 2shot explosive Combat rifle that i am looking forward to rocking the orange Halloween skin on now.
---
It's what happened when GTA V toxic players make it to Fallout 76
---
This seems to have become noticeably worse recently - at least to me. Remember it being like this before, then there was a period where I hardly ever got a disease. 
---
Now I get one every time I’m in a fight, pretty much without fail. Even non-diseased enemies give me a disease. Wtf?
---
I've been a pa heavy gunn for 340 levels lol. I got in to nw for the pa skins. Figured I'd get the ghillie to help me Bush it to 100, at 93 currently
---
Bruh it's legit the keys, since there is no keyring it constantly glitched and has alot of tear and mini lag spikes because of it.
---
I think some guns don't add up with damage but my junkies gatling gun Does pretty consistent damage

Do you remember where? I have heard about the mutant dolphins  in 76 but I have not once seen a dead fish or any other non mob corpse
---
Code is 970930
---
That's the trick. Humans can be the biggest monsters of all, and by the time she is whatever passes for an adult in the wasteland, she is going to have picked up all the traits of the violent nutjobs around her. I wish there had been an option to administer wasteland justice to Crater and rehome her in Foundation. She could borrow some of Davey's drawing paper and help look after the chickens, crawl around the pipework down below, and grow up healthy and well adjusted (or as much as you can in the wasteland).
---
Yep. The breakouts for camp vendors is not well done.
---
This is never going to happen. Ever. There’s no way they’d lock new players out of something like this
---
good to know, i just did it cuz i liked it and before it was 9/10 times where i was soloing project paradise and failing, but i noticed people start to join once you show somebody else is doing the event 
---
next time i'll start the event and once people start joining and collecting the items, i'll run over to the other sectors and see if i can get the players to spread out
---
Near Camden Park. There were two scientists in a tent talking about only seeing a certain creature at night, then just up the river was the fish. (Now you say it, it did kind of look like a dolphin).
---
The amount of hate notes for overpriced items would be hilarious.  Just sticky notes everywhere
---
Ive only filled either the radkelp one or the one with radstag meat and they seemed to be ok to me.
---
I get 14 FPS when looking through vending machines lol a steady 14.
---
Nice. I'm 75 in Adventure, 22 I think in NW. I mostly only played for the Ghillie, but there are a few CAMP and skin items I'd like. I've gotten 1st place 3 times while just Bushwookieing and killing one person. And got 1st place once without killing anyone, last dude couldn't find me in the bush and staying in the storm for too long.
---
Bethesda. Who else?
---
That's some top trolling by one of the game devs.
---
Seriously I would be more okey with time gated content if there was a small amount of free new content each update like in most games. Like add a new skin, side quest or weapon from time to time (maybe once a month?). But right now they either release time gated content or atom shop content so most long time player got all the stuff the base game offers except for those ultra rare rewards with 0.2% drop chance. Basically I think the player base is just moaning for some new content here that isn't payed or only available for a limited time..
---
The issue is they probably fell through the map. I have noticed a few times that I have had that happen. Once in an event where you protect a friendly deathclaw a lot of the bodies disappeared including the legendary sheep thing. While my friend and I were searching a bunch of the bodies fall out of the sky and land in a pile in front of us and we were able to loot them. I am thinking sometimes when we loose bodies they fall through the map but don't get put back in like I had happened.
---
Me too, I still arrive slightly in the nuke zone though sometimes, depending on where it was dropped.
---
I usually do the same bush strat, though I will quickly sprint to the next circle if I'm not currently located in it. Most of the time, I usually end up alone versus 3 or 4 people on a team. At that point, I either pop out and emote for laughs if I have no weaponry, or just madly unload whatever I've got at them.
---
The silly thing is that I've won 3 rounds just through that last stand tactic, yet I've never had a situation where people respond to my emote show with anything except bullets.
---
Yeah it's the same ones from fallout 4 I think. I dont think I've been to Camden park. But TBH I haven't even finished the main story. I think my next step is to meet the overseer at the Nuka plant.
---
That will be the Zetan Cells Generator, season 3. XDDDD
---
Fishing and attracting a queen.
---
They said it's bug if I remember correctly and it should be fixed soon.. hopefully..
---
Might have done it aswell ... how are we supposed to know that something *like that* is rare? Looks like something you get from stripping naked a dead colon lol.
---
I'm building my camp at wayward and I'm setting up a noobs part for it. Lvl 5 guns for free or maybe 5 caps idk. Stims. Radaway, armco machine with free.38
---
You mean I'm lvl 62 NW and I only played for time-limited rewards and now SCORE?
---
Count yourself extremely lucky and just enjoy them. I've been hoping to experience this for the last few months, but sadly, Santa must have decided I was a bad dweller this year.
---
Yeah, just Googled the FO4 ones and it's the same fish.
---
Thanks mate.
---
I am a new player, started as soon as Wastelanders DLC came out and I was given a water purifier within the first hour of playing through the overseer questboxes.
---
I'm unarmed melee using a large deathclaw gauntlet I can 1 hit level 62 scortched and charred ferrals about 90% of the time.
---
I also have mutations though.
---
Here's a look at my card loadout when alone, it seems to work good for me.

---
Even with the slight uptick in participation I've noticed players still have no idea what to do during this event. I've had at least two instances in the past few days where at least 10 players were at the event from the start and only 2 of the troughs had anything put in them. Neither time were either of them filled past rank 2, and both times I filled one entirely by myself. Either players have no clue what they should be doing or they seriously don't care.
---
The event is balanced very well for a group with minimal coordination but even half a server of random players struggle to complete the objectives. I think the devs should remove it from the random public events pool and put a manual trigger on it again. I feel like this would remove some of the frustration from dealing with players that don't understand or care about the objectives.
---
You can’t have both and one doesn’t remove the other, it just won’t work. So if you already have carnivore, then drinking a herbivore serum will just not do anything. Same goes vice verse. Trust me, i tried.
---
Junkies is "magic" at the moment
---
Someone has been editing CAMP too much.
---
This is an Oof of a considerable size
---
Ammosmith. For now.
---
Three weeks ago I reported 2 guys with 50cals with scattershot(obviously cheated in weapon). I even uploaded video evedince. Haven't heard a word from support since... It makes you think, Is there even point?
---
From the comments over the past week from 1st players I'd have to disagree, but whatever.
---
Yup, gotta be. I dumped all of my notes and all of my holotapes on my main that I’ve had since game launch and the lag I still get during anything involving stash/vending is prohibitory.
---
And it’s the same story for all four other characters. The older they are the laggier they are, the younger they are the snappier they are. No holotapes, no notes.
---
Ultracite ammo... Fucking please. Maybe fusion cores?

Opposite exactly infact. They claimed their FAQ was wrong and never meant to claim events would give score.
---
Something I too would love to see implimented! This has come up as a suggestion many times but we'll keep on sending them forward.
---
They really got to make a keyring, I mean Fallout 3 and New Vegas I believe did a great job on dealing with it. There was less clutter to be fussing about which brought me better through and through.
---
Edit: I'm a full health build.
---
They're used to recall the Impostor Sheepsquatch. You get one from doing the quests at Van Lowe's Taxidermy, the event is the culmination of those quests triggered by one of the cards.
---
I tried to pass today's challenge after managing all my modded files and renaming the ini... To no avail.
---
Finding 3 monsters is to much hassle for 250 score imo. I realized that I can get that amount of score much faster by just gaining additional 25000xp which takes 10 minutes tops in a chill pace, while in NW I need to try my best sneaking around to not get killed (I suck at pvp big time, no other way for me) while trying to find 3 elusive mobs to kill. After half an hour spent in 3 matches (which already took forever to populate and load) I only found one creature and called it a day.
---
Not going to fire up that mode again.

Those neon letters are horrible and eat big chunks out of your building budget. The in-game variant is much better, and looks nicer too, as it has an actual neon glow. Just save around 10k caps and buy it.
---
As a tank heavy build I usually do most of the work. While my level 40 friends get the sheepsquatch outfit and Fixer plans I usually get the white wolf fedora.
---
10-20k
---
10k is the basic going price I believe.
---
Since then, I changed my ini file quite a bit because I experienced weird stuff with the enlighten effect ending too soon. 
---
What are you trying to achieve, exactly? My enlighten settings are looking like this atm :
---
bEnableEnlighten=1

fEnlightenCubemapsFadeStart=800.000000

---
bApplyExteriorInteriorsFilter=0

---
bForceOcclusionMapRender=0
---
but keep in mind that I have a potatoe and enlighten is the thing that kills most of my fps so I'm trying to lower it down as much as I can without it looking fugly.
---
Depends on the platform. On ps4 its value is 5-10k
---
lol
---
Um... Destiny’s pass isn’t free... you need to buy the expansion to get access and then there is a “free” track and a “premium track”. So it’s basically a double buy-in as far as I can tell. There is a “pass” that you buy to gain access. 
---
I don’t see any “pass” here to purchase. Hense my question.
---
Should of put platform, I'm on xbox
---
5-10k
---
I'm at 33. I grinded about 2.5 million XP in the past week, that's 25,000 score points worth about 20 ranks.
---
See how your grind works out:  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html)

I want silt beans. It looks like a crop and comes from soy beans and even the noobs at foundation can farm them.
---
Same bro, I'm bloodied and people can't grasp the concept of us not being able to grab a pylon
---
I only saw a use in the rad removing one. I wouldn’t even upgrade it.
---
I literally just created a bank alt specifically for outfits and plans!
---
Okay this may be sad but I barely joined around Wastelanders DLC and I am a level 56. I have no idea at all what a tattered field jacket is; what it does, nor if it's quite essential for a playthrough. Again I apologize for my low history with 76 but I don't know much.
---
Same here, I carry a full set of Troubleshooters with me as well as a Troubleshooters Gauss Minigun which works better on the Imposter than my Vampires Gauss Minigun.
---
For me he always resets today, but not for like another 6 or so hours, normally on Tuesday at noon EST
---
I really got lucky with it last night and stumbled into a group that knew what they were doing. Only the second time I've been part of completing it with all three animals alive. It was a nice change from my usual experience with just me there and no one else, or someone shows up after it's already begun and goes and does their own thing.
---
I just set up and the converted ammo plant and make ammo and occasionally defend it
---
In the beginning we didn’t have the scrip machines, we sold legendaries to vendors, at least then they had a chance to be taken up by someone else who knew better. 
---
I shutter to think all the weapons that I threw away at a vendor.
---
Only at a Firerate of over 200 wich I don't have. Magic weapons also don't work in pvp and it is not at the moment its like this since release.
---
I mean, why would ask this AFTER you bought the game. It’s too late now, lol. 
---
If you’ve played the other fallouts then you already know what to expect. The game is 100x better than when it first came out but it still has its problems, as all Bethesda games do. Some are just more frustrating than others. 
---
I think the best advice you can get right now is just to log in and play. Don’t get guided through the game before you even turn it on, you’re losing half of what sucks you in. Throughout the story and exploration you’re going to have to make decisions and some are going make you sit there for 10 minutes thinking about everything with it. I genuinely liked the story and glad it wasn’t just another finding your wife and son, dad, or guy that shot you. 
---
It’s a ride man, just dive in and discover everything on your own. There’s a huge map to explore.
---
Because they don't care, I just despair really. Introduce a new element of the game and it doesn't work and they don't fix it? 🤷‍♂️
---
How do you do the shutdown code? I've opened that room before, but what's the process?
---
What's it's value?
---
yeah. And demolition expert. I run with 5 in demo and 2 gunsmith. It's a bit overkill tbh
---
Hardended receiver
---
extended barrel
---
aligned stock
---
perforating magazine
---
that's it. The sight is fine as it is.
---
I just found this post today after experiencing the same issues yesterday. I noticed that I did less damage and the "sneak multiplier notification" didn't show up. So I can't say anything about adrenaline but I suspect that the stealth multiplier is gone. Anyone else?
---
&gt; There's some incorrect information about that on our website. It should state that there are challenges to "Complete Events" or "Complete Public Events"  
---
Yeah, makes heaps of sense that you would forget to add "there are challenges to "Complete Events" or "Complete Public Events" to the Question 
---
### ASIDE FROM CHALLENGES, WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE MY S.C.O.R.E.?" 
---
Sounds like you guys had something planned and couldn't pull it off and as usual are backpedalling.
---
Thanks i
---
Unless they did it as a high level expedition, as endgame content where we go to a specific part of DC.
---
Also no NCR. Lorebreaking
---
Wtf at the logic, if you don’t like NW, just don’t play it. You’re not required to complete it just because it’s there, make up the difference by grinding out experience. Why further punish NW players?
---

Wow that's hella stingy considering all the mess we had to endure they should have made it free.

Not according to the subred TLDR. Which means That Looks Done Right.

its the only place theyve ever been able to pick on other people.
---
LH mine is where I loot up lead to sell in bulk to players. Archery builds don’t need lead.
---
Not something I've come across, fingers crossed it stays that way. Hopefully not some new glitch thats gonna happen to everyone eventually.
---
if you anymore than 8k i'd be surprised. Several times i've seen people offering up to 10k and the seller does it for 7 or 8. There's more and more of them out there.
---
Wanted one for another alt a few days ago and someone just straight up gave me one. Which was nice.
---
EDIT: Sorry. just saw that you're looking to sell one not buy one (just woke up)
---
No way they will gate new content like this. And I seriously doubt they will and new big map.
---
I agree Appalachia is too easy. In my opinion this is thanks to how bloodied and especially unyelding are overpowered. And how tanky players are compared to mobs. Also aimbot is stupid. I would love to see explanation how pipboy is able to reorient your body to aim at something. 
---
I think rebalance to current stats is better way than adding lvl 100 bullet sponges mobs.
---
Other players

True i am on lv 41 atm that was 2 days ago.I grinded the exp as much as i could with all the buffs i could get,even lunchboxes.The reason why is i dont know if the repeatable xp will stay or will it change with every week,and im on vacation now for 3 weeks without a pc :)
---
No problem, thanks for the help

How does unlocking stuff in NW work? I played it for the first time today and I noticed I had around 180 perk packs to open or something, so i was opening them and I got a heap of rewards, for literally doing nothing. Some xmas themed stuff, some halloween themed stuff (armour and weapon skins I think?) and some C.A.M.P items. It also mentioned that I had a bunch of duplicate cards to trade or something?
---
It's still there, just take it to a radio tower and use the tape.
---
Id place money on the Scout Ghillie not working on Thorn set. Sorry.
---
I transfer all of them to my low level character, and they get the quest still. As recently as yesterday. But my high level doesn't, even though they can still call in a supply drop all the same - just without the quest.
---
I've walked up to almost everything in game and punched it in the face. But If I can't sneak up to one them, I go to the other side of the road and run away.
---
One word: keys
---
Commenting on a deleted post, but what the hell - 
---
Using exploits is one thing, but displaying the results of the exploits so carelessly and stupidly? 
---
Player deserves to get banned. If not for the xp exploit, then surely for being an idiot who thinks it’s ok to display the fact that they are cheating.

Not gonna lie.

Should've recorded it and uploaded it, honestly. Sounds like his rant would go good with some fries.
---
You done good dad
---
"Why do we put up with this? Why do we keep playing this shit? Why does it have no consequences for Bethesda?"
---
Probably because we like the game. Sad, but true.
---
I mean have you seen Destiny 2 they got it locked nicely.
---
lvl 1 and 10 bloodied gun together with low lvl UNY gear

---
Nothing like having passive 80% disease resistance but getting one anyway on every hit
---
I just realized I am thinking of the wrong quest ... I never did this before I was thinking about this quest at camp venture where just put in the note you find ... isn't this quest called similar?
---
I like red dead's system
---
Me as a shotty build approves this :)
---
Honestly this season would've been the best time for it, Captain Cosmos theme and all.
---
You don't need the quest to do it. Just go to any radio tower and pop in the holotape.
---
# So we have the same location
---
I only eat glowing mass and high radiation fluids.
---
jk, I eat ionized meat and flux, which running a single nuke zone gets you a ton of and they don't spoil while restoring a ton of food/water and being able to heal you very fast in a pinch with ghoulish.
---
Or confusing red cranberrues with the black wild ones.
---
It seems like the closer you get with vats (on head shots) the worse your chance to hit gets
---
I can be point blank and miss every single headshot at 95%, but if I back off 9 paces I nail it first try.
---
Part of it is the weird way this game handles point blank aiming with vats, like you shoot at ceiling or way off to side, I think the game has trouble aligning the barrel to the center or the target as the two characters approach each other. It’s obviously and definitely a bug. Yet another one that will never be fixed.
---
Same here! A lot easier to gain xp in adventure mode.
---
The closest we would get to the ncr is the desert rangers also that would be shit for new players grinding to a high level is boring as shit and it would make stuff way worse if they did that, whilst it would be cool to leave Appalachia they shouldn’t level lock it
---
Last time it happened, i pick-locked a world spawn (not built by player) toolcase in a claimed workshop as i was depositing the red rocket cores. I resisted a bit on my camp second floor and removed the entrances until some guy in pa did a big jump and killed me with his gauss minigun in less than 1s.
---
Just a stupid kid being edgy, I’m sorry you went through that toxic experience
---
Agreed.   
---
Also why not give SS Leg mod to allow for no Limb DMG from a fall?   
---
Make a SS helmet that protects against airborne disease.  
---
Make a SS Arm mod that gives 45% Armor pen and increased accuracy.   
---
Then delete Power Armor from the game and be done with it already.
---
Hi thanks I'm PC but I use 2 characters together mostly in same closed team so at least I don't let anyone else down who's playing NW properly!
---
Thank you.
---
GtaV
---
Vaccinated does work maxed out as I used to get a disease all the time and even stack 5 plus diseases at a time lol but now I rarely get a disease and when I do its only rad worms
---
That quest is Forbidden Knowledge, and it's still in the game. You need to pick up a fresh Technical Data from a container in the wild, e.g. the desks in the Whitesprings bunker, to trigger it. It's best to get rid of any old, non-functional Technical Data first by selling them of for one cap each at the nearest vendor. And you can only hand in one Technical Data while the quest is active.
---
Any additional TD you have in your inventory or you pick up while the quest is active, is wasted and becomes useless except for selling it off for one cap. If you want to maximize your farming, take note instead of any containers with TD, so you can go back, pick up the next one and trigger the quest again as soon as you have dropped off the first one.
---
The NCR hadn’t existed yet but you can do some epic stuff with the outfit
---
...Yeah agreed. SS armor should do just as good as PA just because we said so.
---
you are thinking of the technical docs.  Yes, it only triggers once. If you have 5 when it triggers, you only use one and the 4 left are unusable. it will only trigger when you find a new one.  You can drop the others, there is no reason to keep them. It will only trigger once you find a new one and they do not stack although they used to a long time ago.
---
The ability to fish up super rare unique plans with a 0.001% drop rate, woo!
---
Thank you for the explanation I'll see if I have old TD and then get lucky finding a new one!
---
Nice work thanks. Just started a new build and need a load of plastic for shotgun shells, will hit the places you suggested for it.
---
Agreed on the last part. No idea how they could leave in those penalties for PA users but make them magically nonexistent on non PA users. When you use a jetpack without Power User with PA you can see the bar deplete fast.
---
Unless something was changed in the last few months, a handful of server hops there usually got me at least 3 legendaries in addition to the hundreds of acid.
---
Really nice and detailed post! This could certainly help most folk out for sure, by the way uranium fever is a great steel source just go for hits and scrap all weapons down &amp; collision course grant’s 500 pre-war money for some easy cloth.
---
Side question..? Does lucky hole really have a cool down I must be “lucky” because I server hop 3-4 times and am still able to mine all nodes
---
EQ2 was better than one first and second it’s meant for the Charleston police department it was most likely distributed to all police departments where there were heavy riots

When the sheepsquatch spawns shoot it for a few seconds. Damage you do counts towards getting loot even if the mob is invincible.
---
The aquatic version of perfectly preserved pie. That's honestly my worry. It would lead to a new set of mounted plans that would unlock with each specific catch, maybe a set of treasure that could be pulled up too.
---
A guy that gets that mad at a game probably couldn't make it out of his own town to hunt anyone down.
---
FYI for next time: just fast travel, you can usually fast travel right to the same camp for 0 caps when you’re inside like that.
---
Trying this now great idea
---
So the holloween and Xmas stuff are bugged atm. The perk packs are also from a big that has now been patched. You get xp for opening them. If you get a duplicate card you get xp, you also get an overseers ticket, used to buy cards.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards
---
There's a list of the rewards from nw
---
I never use VATS in this game.
---
But PC Will get Fallout 76 too
---
Does it count as a ballistic or energy weapon (for the mutations)?
---
Your PC is fine, it's the wonky game engine.  Try switching between full screen and borderless window if you are still having issues and see if there is any difference.  For a while I played on my 9 year old computer because I would get less freezes and crashes than on my brand new one.  That issue has been fixed though.  Even my new computer sucks compared to your setup though, SHOULD run fine for you.
---
😂😂😂🤣🤣
---
Well she has it a lot better then others. Food, water, bedding, security, etc. If she wasn't a Crater raider, there's a big chance blood eagles, the scorched, or the other dangers would have gotten to her first.
---
Watch some videos on Youtube, this is how I figured it out and ended up getting a set of Troubleshooters armor just for this event.  You only need a one star set and its easier than getting Unyielding.  It's all about the strategy.
---
&gt; Perhaps jetpacks do drain cores faster in 76 than in Fallout 4. Maybe Vats and sprinting does too. Maybe that's intentional because in 76 cores are even easier to farm thanks to the fusion core generators at power plants. Maybe there's a bug that jetpacks are ignoring the double duration perk. Maybe it's just perception and there is no difference. 
---
...Yes, and that's why we're talking about it here. Because.... Perhaps, it do.   
---
What I don't get is how you've played the game for an extensive amount of time, or you've alluded too, since the person you're arguing with stated he has as well... Yet... For some reason you can't use your own experience to gauge whether those "Maybes" are right or wrong?  
---
I mean, you're acting like you were at the scene of a crime, and while being questioned, you're responding with, "Maybe they did get shot, maybe they didn't, who knows for sure really?" Cut out that crap. Nobody likes that. You don't even like that. Admit it. That's not a valid response.   
---
The fact is, FC drain IS FASTER in Fallout 76. After having played the game for 4 fucking years straight, and then playing Fallout 76 for almost 2 years straight, I'm going to have to go with YES.
---
Is there any chance, someone have a list of all the rare items/outfits in the game?
---
Totally see what you're saying, seems reasonable....but since we're talking about Fallout 76 who knows really when it comes to the "is this a bug or intended?" question lol
---
You need them all
---
If you followed the main quest you would have got plans to craft the small one at Morgantown airport. 
---
For the large one and to start two other side quests, head over to any train station and read the 3 posters on the bulletin board
---
You can also use the photo mode glitch to get threw, though fast traveling is much simpler haha
---
I have that same problem on xbox with the wheel been like that since wastelanders update kinda defeats the purpose of having a wheel
---
Don't forget about the grafton monster and either snally's or super mutants in the hemlock holes "golf course" For more acid or mats.
---
Tangara town, climb the tree and enter inside it for cave crickets for Acid.
---
Silvia homestead (barn that starts project beanstalk) bags of chlorine for more acid.  
---
Lewis and sons farm supplies south of silvia and north west of nuka factory for more Acid.  
---
Hornwright testing site #3 for more Lead and Steel ore.
---
Ok i got no notification for those messages. There are many names like mine but I am the only one with the profile (URL) ID i gave you
---
I was just about to comment "I'll never do Battle Bot again because I don't want anymore of those damn keycards" and saw this. Had no idea you could use the ones you already had, thank you so much for this!
---
Responder vendors apparently sell them. But i cannot remember ever seeing one on a responder vendor. 
---
My alt which is 120 can build them. My main which is 223 cannot. HMM!
---
It's sold by Responders vendors. Try Whitespring resort. I have the plan and don't think it helps with defence, but could be completely mistaken
---
More lead can be easily found, too
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hk3993/my_leadgrabbing_route_to_help_others/
---
get ready for the rep/bait grind. 
---
if you min/max it, getting ranked to get high level bait so you can catch anything except for dirty boots and kelp will take you 63 weeks. but no worries.. this part will probably be exploited to bits so everyone is full rep in a week  
---
the bait grind though is going to be a pain - you need to fish for boots and kelp, but only 1/1000 rewards you with the "mysteries" affix, which can be turned in for BateBait, which can then be used to purchase high end Bait. enjoy your Trouts and well.. boots and kelp obviously. cant make it too easy..
---
I got attacked randomly and didn't retaliate and still got killed and robbed
---
You should be able to find it at the responder vendors at train stations etc or try the one at Whitespring
---
Inside the big shopping mall section?
---
no look magic shotguns on yt.
---
its also works on shottys
---
There is a gigantic note at the top of the support page that says replies will be delayed
---
Apparently it acts as a target that enemies try to go for like a turret, so it draws them out into the open for your turrets, stuff like radscorpions and mole rats are the biggest nuisance.
---
It sure does! Wiki says all Responder vendors, I see it once in awhile at the Charleston station. I don’t buy that it’s any kind of defense. I’ve heard this too but I still get attacked on the other side of my camp and in one camp I have a scarecrow outside of a fenced in crop row and mole rats still go for the crops first * shrug *
---
Why don't people just use the pa glitch to get in
---
Yes. Easiest challenge ever
---
Wow. I’m a Bloodied build and I don’t even have ass/sent or Uny/sent armor and I will rank a Gauss mini long enough to kill the guy using it. I suggest upgrading to heavy combat armor or Secret Service armor.
---
My experience in milling a PvP player usually ends with them claiming I have no skill and beat them because they weren't ready or some shit.
---
Also usually has some racism or threats in there, too. 
---
If you dont want to PvP with me dont shoot at me. I *will* shoot back.
---
It makes it much weaker
---
According to the wiki it doesn't count as an energy weapon  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gauss\_shotgun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gauss_shotgun)
---
Oh I kinda know where they are just, as mentioned above, hard to spot. I'm lazy so usually I buy mentats...then it is just brain, starlight and firecracker.
---
I do hit the ag center, and that usually has some inside.
---
Yeah I'm getting close to 100 on my first character and I really they don't exist any more ahaha
---
Oh okay so it might be hearsay or just random chance that people have been having with it?
---
Also, super mutants give lots of gunpowder, as do many raiders and raider corpses...
---
So which day should they choose to run it? I'm sure between the 4 of us we can think of the universally best day for hundreds of thousands of players.
---
He plays too much GTA. Don’t hate on the poor guy... I’ve been doxxed and had a bullet with my name on it sent to me through the post. I reported it to the police. For “privacy reasons” I haven’t been told the outcome.
---
Do you have a power armor chassis?
---
You have to put it down near the frame
---
welch.  the mole miners in welch.  scrapper perk is a MUST for this.  take all their dropped weapons and scrap them.
---
You will need to claim a PA frame and deploy it for the crafting option to work.
---
Lol.
---
I like it when they are still talking while their gas bottle encrusted head is flying away from their crumpling body.  :D
---
I’m not sure. There does seem to be a priority list for camp attackers so maybe the scarecrow is a higher priority than vending machines, for example. I just know for sure it doesn’t help my crops from my experience.
---
QQQQQQQ
---
I always find about 500 ore in there
---
morgantown high
---
Yeah, he is located in one of the shops on the left closer to the entry. I think theres a "book seller" Miss nanny on one side of the shop and the responder protectron on the other. I think its a pretty rare roll on their inventory lists though so it may take a bit to actually get it. Also try Charleston, Camden park, Flatwoods and the one at grafton (not the one in the train station..the other one). You MIGHT find it on Grahm too
---
If you are a human being, please don’t give IRL death threats. Period. A reasoning for why doesn’t *ever* make that shit better. Just don’t do it.
---
Man, I came here to play Fallout, not GTA.
---
I was in an excacator PA lol. Working my way towards that gauss mini
---
At least they were dumb enough to mail you the bullet rather than other means of delivery.
---
I know what you mean man, get it just the same
---
The only time I won’t shoot back is if I’m caught in the crossfire after a SBQ because I know it’s accidental as I’ve done the same thing
---
Yeah but hey, if some level 30-something feels like they can take me down before I get close enough to strong attack them with my instigating DC, they're welcome to try.
---
Speed Demon has helped tremendously.
---
&gt; Do you have a power armor chassis?
---
nope. 
---
damn how do I get one?
---
Hmm I have 3 of them at the front of my house and mobs keep destroying all my fences and the collectron terminal 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Big thing on the numbers is that it only shows one component of damage. Some perks and effects are applied outside of that number, and are never reflected there but applied nevertheless. If I recall properly most of those are things that "stack" or apply on the target like furious, tenderizer, etc. and some flat reductions.
---
Oh yeah, I was scared shitless but at least I’m not in jail... XD
---
\- Looks ugly AF
---
\- Cannot wear cute outfits
---
but there's many people who would disagree with you
---
Bethesda. Doesn’t. Care. 
---
What I can’t figure out is why so many on here do.
---
Though.... instead of adding fishing to the game at large, if you isolated it to being a specific game event that would encourage group play, maybe at the grafton dam, you could make it interesting. 
---
Say with each cast you have a chance to pull up anything from common junk, to fish which would automatically become meat in your inventory, maybe some mounts (like that sharp toothed Dolphin we've been seeing since F4) to safes which could be unlocked or blasted open, and finally a chance to trigger a legendary boss, not sure what though, might need a new cryptid. Chessie maybe, though a little outside its normal area.
---
The boss would take extra damage from harpoons and pole hooks, just for flavor. It could have a chance to drop a unique armor/weapon set or unlock a seaweed/driftwood skin. Maybe a power armor set that looks like old school deep sea diving gear.
---
I need sleep.
---
Those games also have more gameplay than 76, which is the key problem. There's nothing really resembling dungeons or raids in 76, with the content that once did, the Vaults, since removed for being too buggy.
---
Even Destiny 2, which has lots of complaints about its seasons, has more activities and much more refined core gameplay than 76.
---
In addition, 76 doesn't even really support proper grinding, with the limits on currency and reputation one can acquire. At best, you can keep farming legendaries, but for what purpose? There's not really any content to use them with.
---
Lastly, the strengths of 76, stuff like the exploration and the base building, don't actually grant much in the way of rewards.
---
Thus, people have reason to be annoyed with the current season implementation, especially given the bugs piled on top.
---
Yeah but instead of whining on a sub, he could have recorded it and reported the player.
---
So far I only played it for challenges. If it wouldn't lag more than regular mode, and these top level all powerful weapons wouldn't feel like I'm using nerfguns, I might would play NW without other reasons.
---
Ive got 242 saved up. Thank God its a world spawn now. I stop by every time to pick one up everytime I go to the cranberry bog.
---
The wiki [has a list of locations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76)).
---
I really want to get myself a 2000 cap bounty again. I do that every now and then. If I have a 5 cap bounty then everyone and their mom will come after me, but having a 2000 cap bounty is a big massive “Come and have a go at me if you think you’re hard enough” not an “Oh shit. I didn’t mean to do that pls don’t hurt me”
---
Yup took me close to an hour as well now.
---
If you're on PS4, I can help you with the tadpole quests and everything. (: My PSN ID is ToxicFluffle.
---
LOL no, Chemist perk gives you 4 diluted stimpaks from one normal stimpak. Withoutig you get 2 diluted stimpaks. So technically, Chemist is already giving you duplicates, for free.
---
Who’s shrugging it off? Dude was just sharing his experience with diseases. I agree, they don’t do shit. Game says I’ve contracted some bullshit but I never see any difference in gameplay other than food and water loss from parasites. It’s annoying as fuck to see it on the top left of my screen every ten seconds though, and I agree it needs to be reworked and actually make sense. I shouldn’t contract a disease from a ghoul I sniped a football field away.
---
Any cryo can do that.
---
Platform?
---
Lets really hope for, that’s nothing I want to do more than once.
---
That logic works in the real world (sometimes) but when you spend 2000 caps to get the card to start the event you don't want to just stand there getting vaporized by the Imposter.
---
this. i sell every ammo i can in my vending. stims and scrip legendaries. started doing this on a new character and havent made ammo once through 160 levels.
---
Na need two full clips(25) to freeze win both a junkies and a two shot
---
I tend to eat lots of soups which require boiled to make. I get purified as rewards and sell it down periodically. I make most of my caps selling aid items I get from playing I wont use.
---
There usually is one down there also
---
The arrow on either side is acceptable, they are just different styles of shooting.  [Here is a youtube vid.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n5M2KHVyWI)
---
I was today years old I found out about the bonuses. I never knew what other PA sets do
---
Oh no they made an armor piece with physics in a Bethesda game!?! You better just get used to seeing the glitch, man
---
Most legendary effects are already useless in PvP. Especially OP ones like bloodied. Damage cap is 110 and you can easily hit for 110 without any legendary effects. The only stat that matters is fire rate. Automatic explosive weapons reign supreme. Because explosive weapons can break the damage cap. I have an Assassins fixer that is literally pointless because the assassin’s effect doesn’t do anything since im already hitting for 110. Same for bloodied, instigating etc. I can understand a damage cap to an extent. Because nobody wants to be one shot with an instigating rifle by someone with stealth armor and 3.5 sneak crit bonus.
---
I hate this event and won’t even bother. Way too hard and horribly optimized to never get a good drop off you even can find the drop
---
Damn forgot to add it, PC.
---
I feel like a idiot know. It made more sense in my head then i really thought because unarmed weapons are basically "one-handed".
---
Cheese and crackers, preferably, my good sir and or madam. Good wine should not be divulged with cheap, deep fried potatoes.
---
They should empliiment plumbing pipes the same way wires/conduit for electricity works. Let us run lines of plumbing from purifiers connecting the pipes in similar manor to a sink. Hell, just use the same graphic as the conduit (perhaps a different color), call it "plumbing". Have little connector points on water based appliances (just like electrical machines have the wiring point) and voila! This would be an easy addition to the camp build and would be an awesome QOL improvement. And finally give us working showers, toilets and bathtubs.
---
*maybe
---
What you described has been my only experience. I expected teams to make it better. All it did was have more people attend the event but otherwise zero people contributed to filling the troughs. They just hung around idle or arrived late so exactly the same deal with you.
---
It seems like without dedicated healers, events like this and Free Range are nigh on impossible to complete with full rewards.
---
The build is the same for both, just swap in rifleman or commando perks as needed. I leveled as a rifleman and then switched to commando at end game for better dps against things like the queen.
---
They are both fun tbh.
---
There's loads of content.  A second playthrough with another toon uncovered lots of mission detail.  The first run through was done in a rush, skipping dialogue etc.. . The second is much more rewarding.  It's a pity Bethseda don't play to the games strengths.
---
Been a issue since like all their rpg games that’s always fixed buy mods. Apparently BGS never figured out how to do it themselves
---
have leveled 5 chars to 50+ by now, and every time i've had literally hundreds of stims and aid items before getting to the mire, even though grenades and aid items are the first to be sold to reach daily 1400caps.  
---
the resources are littered everywhere, including super high levels (500+) often dropping up to 100pounds of ammo, plans, aid and legendaries in containers on trainstations all around the map.  
---
dont get me wrong, i completely agree that its a dick move. had the same thing happen when i dropped items for a low level friend more than once. but its quite the overreaction you got going here.
---
Ah yes, you're fighting a horde of charred feral ghouls, next thing you know, you die because one of them just happened to give you radworms by slapping you! who would've thunk it?!
---
absolutely needs to be reworked.
---
When i try do second habitat no one come and my animal is weak, and die because others players don't defend they animal and i come to defend their powerful one and mine weak animal is dying, its happen often.
---
Only one solution to this problem is defend one animal. 
---
And then when one guy with blood kill boss and noone have reward, its happen too often.
---
Ya'll will be back for season 2 muhahaha
---
Tbf a lot of the dumb ways people play are just smart ways to play that the game doesn’t like but doesn’t explain to not to. Why wouldn’t I get on a roof against the queen so I don’t get chipped by mobs?
---
I one hit kill everything with my stealth shotgun build. SBQ is the only thing it doesn't work well with. Any other scortchbeast is a 2 shot. I played 5 hours yesterday and had 700 or so shells and only used 150 (farming materials mostly)
---
I didn’t know toxicity existed in this community at all. Any time i interact with someone directly it’s never mean at all
---
Use the camera to see the tags and find them
---
Too bad I missed that. Would have been fun to troll him. If you would dm me his name. I'm curious who it is.
---
All Ammo Matters
---
If you hold the gaus shotgun to full charge then enter VATS, it works great. Thanks to Angry Turtle for that. Enemy has to be in the gun's range tho
---
Hard to do for me in SQB with lots of spawns/mobs.
---
Also, the queen does not show damage like regular enemies, its so much lower. Sorry if known already.
---
Same. Troubleshooter armor and first aid level 3 with super stimpaks actually makes the event pretty easy.
---
the US is very much still in the middle of the pandemic, man. people are working from home, people are sick, they're short staffed. your video game is not a priority, nor should it be. I'm from their area and it's a shit show. have some compassion and some patience.
---
I never understand people who get butthurt for getting killed with a bounty. Take it like a decent person and move on.
---
That guy is disgusting, people like him don't deserve Internet access.
---
... People do that? :|
---
This is the wasteland lol it’s all fair game
---
Bethesda has moved past PvP in F76, maybe you should also....
---
Thank you for telling me that you can swap perk cards since i haven't played the game i like to be prepared while playing games. I made this "Build" after the WasteLanders update so that's why Lone wanderer is there. I realized reddit is a good place to ask so now i'm here and also feel free to be critical since that's how honest answers get made.
---
LOL I have one, too.
---
Or in the hospital. Or ground for that matter.
---
But I was more thinking that by sending it through the mail, they know where it originated, which makes it easier to track down the offender. Even if they weren’t *extra* dumb enough to include a return address (which would make it *really* easy to find the sender), the post mark can tell them at least what city it came from. Better than the whole country to scour.
---
Xbox here and same shit I have crashing randomly as well orfast travel takes my caps but it keeps me where I am
---
i found a bag of 400 large gifts at whitesprings station yesterday. free stuff!
---
I did the same, but mostly because the commando perk cards is unlocked in the later levels
---
&gt; So yes, it is true. Two passes right there where you can get all of the rewards for doing no challenges   
---
No, it is not true. You did not read his comment correctly. His original comment that has been skewered to this idiocy was a response to the first:  
---
" IMO, you should be able to earn all the rank if you complete at least 50-75% of the challenges during the season. "   
---
Pickles response was that no game has ever let you to skip half of the required work put in and still complete the battle pass.   
---
For Smite, you need to play the game to finish the battle pass. Unless you can skip half of that for free you are not telling the truth.   
---
For Vidision 2, you need to play the game to finish the battle pass. I can't believe I'm writing out the same sentence, bla bla bla telling the truth.
---
Commando perks and auto main weapon with an instigating lever or hunting rifle for ammo conservation.
---
I gave them everything. The envelope, the bullet, and the note inside it. As if the bullet wasn’t enough... I didn’t see a return address but the note said “You wanna try that in real life, asshole?”
---
No clue on the wendigos but for the Queen you need to do like 2k damage to get anything from her
---
I don’t care for these chore content they keep throwing at us. I picked up Rust the other day and I started to do my dailies on here but said fuck that. Rust is a chore but it’s a fun chore. “Pick up 100 woods” is not fun. I want actual content like raids or dungeons or something.
---
It should not for two reasons.
---
1. It wouldn’t make any sense lore wise
---
2. The whole point of the alien weapons since fallout 1 has been that they are extremely powerful weapons with extremely rare bullets, forcing the player to use them sparingly.
---
Shit... I scrapped one of those like a month ago.
---
Yes, I can carry more and hit harder when I get out of my fusion powered robot suite. My BoS under armour gives me more strength than my PA, and they don't work together even though BoS under armour are designed for PA. Not to even mention the backpack.
---
I can build a fusion generator, surely I can tie a piece of string to my backpack so it can fit over my PA. Or weld a power fist to my PA?
---
What did I miss?
---
Worst, yesterday legendary boss spawn, one guy and me hit it once and try called others players noone come, and i jumping around him for survive for 2 minute and when one player come he kill legendary just for himself, and legendary fall behind rocks (no bloody mess perk use), and i found it with camera but cant reach prize. This you got when try help others.
---
They said it’ll be material things you do but who loots 100 different wood sources a day
---
sell the docs to vendor, 1 cap each
---
Wow...he can dish it out but can’t take it. He sounds like a griefer picking on lower level players until you came along.
---
Thank you. The map will be completely void of any events that anyone gives a shit about constantly. So everyone’s just standing around.
---
Resolution and textures are fine, Injust don't have any grass hiding my legendary corpses anymore.
---
Me too! I love taking out the Hank hill super mutant. He used to sell propane and propane accessories
---
This is frustraring cause it is so hard to find and players see it in different areas. Why is its death not staic for all so when one person finds it we all can see it. I had three people tell me it was near them (in different areas)  but nope not for me. 
---
Especially since the event costs 1800-2000 caps!
---
That didn't happen.
---
if you still need it i have a modded lvl 45 you can have. I'm on xbox.
---
Yep I had only tried NW one time before when it first released and was pretty disappointed. It’s a cool idea, but it’s so horribly laggy and clunky it’s almost unplayable. Not my internet because adventure mode runs just fine as far as lagginess. Fast forward to a couple days ago, I get on for the score rewards and my first game I get 6 kills and win the game with another player who got 11 kills. Easy as hell, idk if it was because all the bush wooks but it was extremely easy to kill people and win the game and I unlocked 4 Halloween skins and 2 Christmas decorations from that one game. With that being said, NW is cool and all but why the hell does it run so shittily? I would probably casually play here and there but it seriously runs bad, the frames lag is atrocious. Straight up runs like a shitty computer.
---
Certain shotguns that has bashing damage or used with a piece of reduced while blocking. Will apply the full damage number for each pellet in vats. It is a glitch.
---
Tenderizer doesn’t shown up in the on screen damage numbers. 
---
After patch 20 i have noticed that numbers show up but no damage is done for the first 1-3 shots. It so completely random. 80% of the time it is with a headshot. The other times it is a body shot.
---
Sometimes i shot the torso in vats. It says it did damage. I exit vats and the SB has full health.
---
Not to say that basing damage on 200+ firerate weapons do a furious effect that can kill the sbq very fast.
---
That junkies or bloodied with 33% vats and ffr weapons damage is higher then non 33% weapons.
---
So.. the damage
---
Not all the time and u have to be near it for it to show.
---
Game pass, influx of new players
---
Well damn, I wish I had paid closer attention to it then. I wouldn’t have wasted all that ammo trying to kill a sentry bot and an assaultron. 
---
Well 3 level 200+ just straight up came to me once with a 10 cap bounty, just because I lockpicked a lock from an abandoned building behind the race track near the amusement park . I didn't knew it was part of the camp . The container was also empty ... I was also a new player , around level 15 . Its nice to see ppl being nice but otherwise horrible monster assoon as they can one shot you . They took all my junk
---
I'm hardly the greatest proponent for power armor, as I prefer to run stealth. Still playing as a heavy weapon toting walking tank is fun, I'm sure many would agree. 
---
I still think they should buff it though, fix the disease and poision issue, and maybe add some legendary options, if they could do it without making stupidly OP.
---
Is it a 33% vats or bashing damage sub perk?
---
The fact you have to be in the lobby to change perks is stupid. I have a 100 packs I haven’t even opened because the game starts too fast.
---
I played on a public team yesterday and his camp was in Ash Heap, It’s A Trap was turret distance away. So ironic seeing this post today. His camp wasn’t wrecked by the battle but he joined at the very end of the fight and seeing the dead Scorchbeast sprawled across his home gave me the big thumbs down. 
---
Anyway, it IS possible, at least at the Ash Heap event tower.
---
Love your content, Captainoob. Also, hijacking the top comment to say "wouldn't September 14th be mid-September, not the 7th?". You have more time than you think.
---
We really need more people to transition to full health builds. I'm just waiting to complete my T-65 set.
---
There's a way to report toxic players?
---
Wait what they’re all the same? Idk why I expected them to be different. Of course they’re copy pasted... everything about them is lazy and bad.
---
Problem is sometimes someone took it before you having done that quest on 4 characters I bring one with me now.  List though was provided just go grab one from somewhere
---
How do you get a 2000-cap bounty!?
---
Tried to drop to a level 30 yesterday and in runs a level 254 to grab it all wtf
---
I haven't played the game yet so having running abilities was a good idea since the map is huge i was wrong. In Fallout 4 i was using drugs like a crack addict i thought i could carry that meta to this game. Yes i learned that Crafting perks can be unequipped thank you.
---
Post-announcement interviews with Todd state the plan was to expand the map "even to the Capital Wasteland." After the original plans fell through, there's been nothing since, but with Wastelanders being intended as a reinvention of the game, it's possible we might see some new world spaces next year. Maybe.
---
It’s not essential, just rare. Some players like collecting such things
---
Thank you very much sir or ma'am.
---
And you know how???
---
Some of the ugliest clothing in the game are also the rarest. If I didn't know about the loot tables I would have simply scrapped that jacket or left it on the ground: Nobody with the slightest fashion sense would wear that if it wasn't because of its rarity, it's like a dev added a couple more zeroes to the drop chance by mistake and just couldn't be bothered to change it.
---
Queen fights. 
---
It's where I get all my flux.
---
Make a large set of weeklies instead of a small set of weeklies + 7 days of dailies?
---
That way it doesn't matter which day you can play as long as you're willing to make up for it on that day.
---
I understand where OP is coming from, but I pretty much agree with you. It’s not like this post is going to prevent any assclown from doing this that would have done it regardless. If someone starts threatening you this severely, then name and shame them, and report them should go without saying. Fuck that shit. The second you start threatening people outside of a game, then you become fair game outside of the game. 
---
Am I saying people should hunt this person down? No. But simply reporting them in a game wherein reports get largely ignored unless it has to do with exploiters, won’t help either. 
---
Fuck this person, and fuck their couch too.
---
As far as fusion cores go I seem to accumulate those faster than using them without any perk cards. I have already dumped over 70 full cores to my mule. 
---
I'm still almost full time PA build, stomping happily in my bright red T-65 trough almost anything. Currently just don't have any motivation to start to grind fro ss armor on top of regular grinding for those damn s.c.o.r.e ranks.
---
But if you coincidentally die as soon as the event ends, your junk is fair game. 
---
It's a common tactic in Scorched Earth as well, although a bit less so now that the survival tents make it super easy to store immediately. 
---
These days I never go to those events without Fireproof 3 and Dense mod, and if I get downed I just press respawn.
---
Aah, thought it was some actual event lol
---
Because the system doesn't allow that to happen.
---
The only way it would have happened is if you were in Survival mode (where it is encouraged), or you shot somebody else, which flagged you for PVP, or you were doing a PVP event.
---
The frustration of this is multiplied when you can't find a dead legendary robot then it explodes and kills you.
---
I'm fucking dead after reading that 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
---
You use vats?
---
Great chart. However, something that could interfere with the required amounts is the double score week we will be getting. This should allow people to catch up. 
---
Also not sure if you have accounted for this. You get 150 atoms, so presuming you don't spend the atoms you receive on the atomic shop you have 10 space margin of error that will allow you to finish.
---
You and me both. Have been playing for hours daily, joining multiple teams, server hopping, and generally engaging with players in the hopes of getting a leg up on an alt, no dice yet. The search continues though! Good luck to you as well!
---
Someone told me to aim your target first then activate the VATS and shot but it's really annoying, if i'm playing with the VATS i don't want to aim before and i'm always using gun-fu perk so that don't help a lot.
---
This is a real nightmare to see how much junk you need to craft arrows and miss 3/4 of them
---
Diseases should be far more detrimental. 
---
Bone worms: Something like 50% less movement speed. 
---
Rattle Hands: 50% less accuracy and hip-fire accuracy.
---
Rad worms: continuous rad damage taken
---
The way it is now: -1 to all SPECIAL, does not mean shit, when everyone is running +15 unyielding gear.
---
&gt;My experience in milling a PvP player usually ends with them claiming I have no skill and beat them because they weren't ready or some shit.
---
Which is hilarious, because these so-called PVPers engage ONLY when the opponent is not ready or has any other disadvatage (usaully half health and fighting multiple mobs).
---
It increases the benefits of Cranberry relish to increase the xp gain to 25%
---
Exactly, even if it is just a guy with a small delicate ego who couldn't actually do anything even if he wanted to, idiots like this shouldn't be able to mix with the rest of society because they don't know how to socialise and it's not acceptable to be saying shit like that in a game, or anywhere really
---
If there isn't anything you fancy in the shop hold off; there will be something eventually.
---
Plastic too from cups with straws (camden park)
---
I have my camp in toxic valley near acid resource so I get always 10 + 3-5 yao guai/snally that spawn and drop 5 more acid +-screws too!
---
Every time I login or visit after some time.
---
Also yes that workshop is Hella great. I use minigun so I struggle with ammo a lot.
---
There seems to have been a change with a recent patch (18 or 19 I believe). I've noticed that there are times where the nodes won't respawn after a server hop and other times they do. I suspect that they're treated similarly to world items in that if another player loads them into the cell before you they'll be there even if you recently harvested them. I haven't done any real testing since I don't have to craft ammo often so this is purely speculation.
---
I’m glad to see that this is the only time I’ve heard of happening in the game. It’s just nice to know that the rest of the fallout community outshines this jerk.
---
For it to be less of a grind would be nice, but at minimum to have a score banking system like every other pass.
---
And gauss weapon take much more time to charge. So i hold my left click when i'm using my gauss rifle in vats to don't waste time and my hand gonna melt soon
---
Source?
---
You also forgot to mention about how you get more materials for scrapping a pipe pistol than you do for scrapping a piece of the supposedly most advanced piece of armour in the game.
---
Same, I grab every weapon I see.
---
Unless you want to do them for the tadpole badge
---
You forgot the part where the developers didn't design their battlepass system around shorting you at the end of the season so you're incentivized to pay premium currency to meet quota.
---
Or the part where said battlepass system puts all the unique goodies in the first half of the ranks while the later half rewards currency that can be spent on useful resources, allowing the more dedicated players to still feel rewarded while the more casual ones can still get the FOMO items in an acceptable amount of time.
---
And while you didn't miss this part, I would once again like to tack on that this is for a FREE game for anybody happening to read this chain.
---
Break 400 locks. One time I broke 1000. Took me 6 hours.
---
T65 with a legacy jet pack ultracite arm
---
IMO, the galting gun is much better than the minigun, but it depend if your minigun is a good legendary and what your build is I guess
---
Yes I was surprised because all other hand work fine. And I noticed that it's for all devices because when this happened I tried a wired one with the same result.
---
How do you take all 3? If I try more than 1 it says I cannot be a conduit for more than 1 running full t65 so fairly tanky if there's a way to get all 3 pylons I'd love to know thanks btw is the name from odd Thomas?
---
They intentionally left out a catchup/banking system make it more likely for people that can't log on every day or grind exp to have to spend money.  It's the third monetization push in a premium game.  They just keep pushing.
---
I'll bring this idea up with my wife.  Though I'd have an unfair advantage as my current C.A.M.P is located at a nukashine destination in the Mire.
---
Yeah I'm looking at rebuilding my camp and the only thing stopping me at the moment is relisting all my stuff once my vendors are set back up. I'd hate to have it happen when I didn't plan for it.
---
Did you save the clip
---
Oof.. just wait until you encounter the next one 😭
---
(just kidding!)
---
Me with plague walker mutation.
---
It's free real est.. enemies tagging
---
I would definitely buy a collectron. It will collect junk or scrap while you play. (make sure you lock it or people can take your junk) 
---
I believe it's 500 atoms. Worth it.
---
im a power user who notices a huge difference with vaccinated on 🤷‍♂️
---
but still, if it has a breathing apparatus for rads and water, we shouldnt be getting diseases. it should be a clear advantage of wearing PA
---
Where in the bog?
---
I use vats with melee all the time. 
---
One of my favorite tactics is to stealth marsupial jump off a building or something right at the person/monster/whatever and use vats to drop a crit
---
Very few people in pvp expect you to be right up in their faces the whole time
---
Don't even bother with that, I can't even bare to load into NW.
---
No, you need to have it equipped to work. Currently there are no “passive” perks.
---
Ok what I wanted to express is that players shouldn\`t have to use such tricks, but that similiar tricks are used since ever.. And I don\`t like to do them.. But thats just my personal opinion :)... Should have made myself clearer here :) sry.
---
Once equipped, it applies to all guns, as it also works on the legendaries I've obtained from drops.
---
Not just crafted ones.
---
Yes please that would be great
---
Be careful what you ask for...I believe legendary modules are part of the future of this game, and it could get even more grindy.
---
When are you on? I could go online in like 10 mins
---
yeah. it was just an update and not an expansion.
---
I killed a lvl 10 wanted player the other day just to do the atoms challenge.  
---
Afterwards we met and I dropped them lots of stimpacks as a thanks and left on good terms.  
---
If you are high level and 50 caps on wanted.  Expect someone to kill for quick caps , challenge, or just to remove the wanted.  I mean a lvl 10 understood the concept even though we didn't have mics.  There a few bad eggs in this game.  But thankfully they are rare.
---
Because end game gear makes enemies trivial, I hope level normalisation will make it mor fair.
---
You have no challenge and dont get hit that much as below level 100
---
Frog legs is available to all. Just use it
---
yes
---
Ok so I’m definitely going to invest in the hacker perk cause I already got lvl 3 lock pick, thank you for this advice
---
You need to have it equipped to have the benefit. And this goes for both crafting and weapon usage.
---
This is true,I am basically looking for the people who received the plans from the treasure hunter event as i missed it unfortunately
---
Also remove the ability to be staggered in power armor
---
all story and quest related dlc (like Wastelanders) is included in the base game, you just have to download it via a patch. the only stuff you can buy with real money is cosmetics and convenience items.
---
the "wastelanders edition" you can find on psn just includes some cosmetic items based on the Raiders and Settlers factions, and if you REALLY want those you can buy them seperately, but you'll still get the important parts for free.
---
i actually work in retail and when Wastelanders came out we got a shipment of cardboard sleeves we were told to put on all the unsold copies of 76 that said "Now including Wastelanders!", apparently to specifically to emphasize that the update is free.
---
The contemporary camp bundle is well worth buying in my opinion.
---
Isn't it?
---
Im on now g
---
Isn’t that part of the game?
---
I think the game doesn't take into account 
---
projectile speed, amongst a million others, which could provide inaccurate numbers. Either way it's sad that it hasn't been fixed yet, barely even aknowledged from what I've seen so far.
---
I was under the impression it did not apply to explosive ammo.
---
LOL you'd make more selling stims in your vendor
---
In a manner of speaking. I more meant an official event that had something to do with the alcohol, not trolling newbs lol
---
Cool. GT? Mine is GamingHD4Life
---
ITT: Players realising they sold this item for pittance.
---
I hope it becomes a reality, this game might have had a bad launch, but it has lots of potential, I hope Bethesda doesn't screw it up.
---
Okay ill add you and send a message
---
just a tip from "another direction". Run melee at lower levels (say before any scorchbeast confrontations). pick any ammo you find and stock it inside the base (or carry). Melee is easy to maintain: next to nothing repair cost (esp if you run makeshift warrior) and there's hardly any costly upgrades (just one or two). The amount of materials you'll save when running melee is real. And it works too, especially if ran with power armor (high STR and low maintenance costs).
---
Ya, scrapper really amps up the steel you get from some weapons.  I think assault rifles &amp; miniguns are normally like 6-9 steel and with scrapper they go up to about 20-24 per.
---
I saw that, I may get it if it's not too clean. I want wallpapers and proper flooring, such a shame it's all atom bought.
---
Only if the challenge is a reasonable one. I won't do all the file/folder renaming to disable mods, just to end up hoping I get into a situation to finish a crap like "revive 2 players". If it is quick and doable as solo (like deploy camp) then I disable mods, hop in, do the challenge, scavange a bit for stimpacks and then try to progress the "survive in storm for X minutes" lifetime challange.
---
Save save save .. atoms are now hard to come by now, treasure them and buy only what you really want.
---
You don’t have to add me. Messaging me is enough so I can join you or you can join me
---
I solo’ed OVC last time. Barely finished it with my BE Gauss Rifle with 5 seconds left.
---
 https://imgur.com/4WrU3wd
---
Yeah ive done that
---
You would think anything to lighten the server load would go to the top of the priority list, behind whatever the next monetization scheme is of course.
---
Do you have the right perk card equipped. Probably makeshift warrior i imagine
---
Ok coming to you. You get one for free
---
You're paying $20 you can get it for $10 from GameStop and Walmart
---
A Youtuber called Abgry Turtle recently posted a video called "PC Performance Fixes, Custom ini Settings, FPS, Stutters, Clear Water - Fallout 76 Wastelanders".
---
It helped me
---
Okay hang around because if its not the right mask you can keep it okay but thank you regardless
---
I did find that perhaps the most useful and interesting thing in the shop. I've seen ones that look like Santa too, could you unlock them at Christmas with an event or something, or was it just store bought then too?
---
Here's a better comparison:    
---
You go to your coffee shop, and buy a "members pass" for 60 bucks, giving you a 20% discount on whatever you buy.  Later they instated a "special member" monthly fee for 15 bucks, and if you don't have it you have to wait in line behind all the "special members".  Later they cut the discount to 5%, and instead of it being on anything you buy, it's just on decaf coffee and muffins, and you only get it if you show up every day, or you work there.    
---
Personally I'd find a new coffee shop.
---
He must know that. You need to get into the place where the ammo is to even get the plan to mod the alien blaster to use regular e-cells 
---
How he got that and not the actual alien ammo sitting right next to the plan is a mystery
---
Maybe read what I wrote again :) No one is trying to do that
---
Ok but pretty sure it’s the one from the treasure hunt event I can craft
---
They're saying that a flatwoods monster shows up constantly and takes control of the SBQ
---
Nuclear waste is a junk component, it can't be scrapped down any further.
---
My new steel farm is to do Line in the Sand with the FO1st tent forcing all the scorched to spawn in the middle by the sonic emitter.  You get so many guns and scrap from that chaos.  It is a slow slog to the nearest workbench but I get like 1000 steel every event.
---
if it wouldn't bother you, i'd go ahead and switch the graphics setting to low manually. i play with an i5 and got plenty of stuttering on everything above low, but low works fine.
---
&gt;This sub has a tendency to see any effort to make money as a under handed, illegal, sleezy, immoral action by BGS.
---
They introduced the Atom Shop to keep up with the demand of the game needing more content.  
---
Then added convenient items to the Atom Shop after looking at the data.   
---
Then they added Fallout 1st saying they needed more money to sustain the game.   
---
Now they have added a $150-to-skip Battle Pass.   
---
"They just want to make some money" - LOL, don't make me laugh. I'm sure you'll be back to defend their next stage of monetization, too.
---
Why are you getting downvoted? You're absolutely right
---
When it comes to collecting materials Scrapper made big difference for me.  I struggled to keep steel and acid until I started using it.  Now I have up to 4-5000 steel and 2000 acid (with F1st).   Every now and then I have to make a run to the Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Sounds like the actions of someone either very immature, under the effects of a drug, or having mental challenges.  Not good in any case.  If you have the opportunity record and report then change servers.  Exciting someone in that condition could lead them to harming someone IRL.  I am not a mental health professional, this is just my opinion from having been around a bit and seen/heard people 'play stupid games'.
---
&gt;  get the Scout Armour Ghillie Paint as I currently wear Thorn Armour    
---
   
---
Sorry, but that makes it sound like you are connecting Scout Ghillie Paint with Thorn armour - which is also a Scout Armour base. I think I was making a fair assumption.
---
I also stopped playing d2 to play 76 again a lot more. I was getting my caps, scrip, and shopping for an hour or so, then playing destiny 2 for a couple hours... But it's getting silly. As long as it's cosmetic things... I'm good. But also a lot of content added in 76 was one and done type of thing, so there's that.
---
They can't handle the truth
---
Okay thats perfect  thank you im outside
---
It is already nuclear material. And even if you have junk that isn’t already fully scrapped, once you craft something it’ll get scrapped automatically
---
I only wear my power armor in certain conditions as I am primarily a rifle/sneak build.
---
1) In a nuke zone
---
2) When fighting in close quarters with many high level enemies that I can’t shoot fast enough with my rifle
---
3) I’m mining for lead.   
---
Other than that I use my normal modded armor with various legendary effects and a backpack.
---
It was those who convinced me to do the raid with the raiders.   Well....up until that other dude in the suit annoyed me
---
That's a big freakin guitar if it's bigger than a suit of PA.
---
Had a guy recently attack my friend at the ammo workbench.  He accepted the lose and changed servers.  A few min later the guy had added him as a friend and jump into his server.  Followed us around trying to get us to attack him by jumping in front of us when we shot at stuff.  All four of us got messages from the guy calling us trash because we didn't want to pvp him.  We just gave up and left the game.  We all reported him for harassment but I doubt anything going to happen to him.  I told him I felt bad for him.
---
I routinely finish this event solo using only the jukebox. I turn it on at the start of the event, pick off the bad guys and repair it when it breaks. Most times, I kill the wendigo with a couple of minutes or more left on the clock. 
---
Are you using the jukebox? Do you keep it repaired and running? It’s not as easy to tell anymore, you have to look for the holotape in the player slot and listen very closely. Plus, watch the bar to make sure it’s increasing.
---
Thanks so much dude i appreciate you doing that for me
---
Yeah no problem. Have a good one
---
Ok
---
Dunno man, I solo this event all the time.  But I usually hit it as soon as it pops on my screen.
---
My pink donut power armor covered in literal sprinkles would like to disagree
---
Oooooh! I would never have realised, thank you so much!!
---
What do you mean the right perk? Im just repairing my weapon using the workbench and the game thinks I have bone. As in no bone junk. Even tho I have the game doesn't recognize that
---
I’ve been going crazy over this and never realised, thank you so much!!
---
What are you talking about? The post is not deleted nor is pointing out some exploit a crime. Think most of you are afraid that this might get attention and the banhammer will smack you.
---
Ye but for a death claw gauntlet
---
yes, using the jukebox. maybe somebody turned it off or something. Very weird.
---
Another location that has a ton of lead without the need of Power Armour or any special perk cards is the Charleston Fire Department - in its gym room there are a large number of dumbbells and weights that you can scrap for a bunch of lead too.
---
No... No you can't. They are bound to the character that made them... :( Was wishful thinking on my part.
---
Gonna have to disagree with you, i recently brought a full set of modded X01 PA for 6k, after being disappointed initially with PA much like you seem to be i thought i'd give it a go at a higher level, moved around maybe 15 points and chucked the armour on.  
---
I now main a Bloodied heavy gunner PA, have a Junkie's melee/shotgun alt and the oh so common Bloodied stealth rifleman and the PA is by far the funnest to play, all subjective though.   
---
Almost all of your issues with PA builds are irrelevant at higher levels once you have the spare perk points, caps, acquired plans and so many fusion cores you find yourself dropping them more than you use.   
---
I think it works great this way, if PA mods were super easy to obtain and the builds had more flexibility it would dictate how the whole game is played, almost everyone would be running PA and wheres the fun in that?
---
So you’ll come back tomorrow, is my guess
---
Save them. Good stuff like the backwoods bungalow or the various collectron types pop up occasionally.  Don't get lured in by the fluff.  Wait for the best things, which unfortunately are usually in a 1200+ atom bundle.
---
Not what I mean I’m saying are y’all the super skilled free aiming sort because what happens if someone decides to use a stealth boy not trying to be rude or anything
---
I don't think the idea is bad. A little bit grinding is also not bad. But this current amount of SCORE needed is really up to the limit. For the next season Bethesda needs to remove the +25 SCORE scaling per level. This would effectively halve the amount of points needed.

It would also remove the psychological manipulation of the SCORE requirements and board advancements. When we are at rank 10, we naturally assume that we are at 10% of the journey and that we are on the right track. But the math shows that to complete 10% of the journey (meassured in points) we need to be at rank 20! It's the same nature of trick as when beet companies make glasses that are narrower in the lower bottom half.
---
This. Exactly.

---
Or when you're dropping 1300 dmg hits on fireflies and it takes 16 shots to bring them down.
---
The weekly challenges haven’t updated yet. It’s still about 3-4 hours left.
---
I think it's more than that.  I think it's a grind, and that there's no banking because it will encourage people to just say "fuck this, I'll just pay for it."  Seems like a dangerous game to me.
---
Really worth trading only. But cap value is probs around 70k+
---
Nah, you don't need to sprint around that much. Fast travel is a thing, and unless you want to farm random encounters, are absolutely broke or overencumbered, or want to avoid Fast Traveling for RP purposes, there's no reason not to use it.
---
Drugs and addictions are still a thing and Junkies is pretty much 2nd best damage after bloodied/unyielding low-health builds. The only drug from the solo games that's missing is Jet.
---
Condition bars above 100 percent are tied to your intelligence when crafting or over repairing using improved repair kits or perks like weapon artisan.  It's not related to the gunsmith perk at all.
---
And as others have said, need to have the perk equipped for it to work unfortunately.
---
Someone could be turning it off, thinking the 30 mi ute timer applies. That will cause you to fail. Its very hard to hear now. I usually hang around the jukebox for a few seconds to confirm I see the arm.pick a cassette and play it, plus i have to listen super close to hear any music whole standing on top of it.
---
Also, the jukebox is super fragile it seems now. Three ghouls will pop it if they get by me and I still kill them within a few seconds. I find I have to activate the jukebox again after repairing it. 
---
I dunno man, maybe there's something useful there. I hope so. If you're on xbox, I can help you beat it.
---
Thanks for the recommendation. It’s kinda strange that my ps4 seems to run this game better than my pc. I feel like my pc should easily be able to run this at high but I guess not.
---
Personally I think it's the best thing you get. It lets you make houses that blend in.
---
It's a lot easier to hit someone with a melee swing than a pinpoint gunshot when they are stealthed 
---
And again, nobody expects it 
---
I do pvp with knives only to make it a lot more balanced though. It's so boring having 2 invisible ghosts shooting at each other with electricity. Yawn!
---
I just watched the video and sadly none of the settings he recommended fixed my stuttering. I guess I’ll just get used to it.
---
It’s to stretch out the daily log ins for the game and to make sure you can’t do too much too quickly, running out of things you want until you stop playing.
---
Some people still think they can farm this event like before and turn it off, sometimes people troll, and sometimes it gets turned off by accident.
---
I also think but am not sure that when it gets repaired its off by default.
---
You need to babysit it and repair when necessary and make sure it is on and playing.
---
Other then it getting turned off I've never not completed this hunt
---
wow there's still some helpful people here, thanks!!
---
My IGn is Lunar Lunacy . I’d really appreciate the plan. Just let me know a cap ammount.
---
You know, I don't even mind a grind that much.  Sometimes I enjoy checking out for a while.  The problems here for me (and why I just uninstalled the game) are that 1) they cut atom income so dramatically, and 2) the pass was designed in a way to force you to play every day, I'm guessing intentionally to encourage you to spend even more money.    
---
When they added the sub I was like... ok I don't like this direction, but I enjoy the game, so i'll just overlook it.  This shit was just a step too far for me to feel ok supporting it.    
---
It sucks because I DO like the game, and I'm even itchy to play it (that's why I'm here, instead lol) but I just won't support games that treat their players this way anymore.
---
Ash heap is a shit hole. I honestly rarely see anyone build there. Unless it's just on the edge next to the rusty pick.
---

---
The campfire tales event gives lots of acid from all the big spawns.
---
Good idea.
---
I’ve had to do that course for 3 different characters and it sucked worse each time. So glitchy, especially the gunnery range for me.
---
Mini nukes. I'm glad you can trade in missiles and 40mm grenadea. But christ. I still have no use for mini nukes.
---
Yeah, they put the cap in there to keep you logging in every day, that's what beth wants.
---
Buy on Sunday. I have faithfully bought on Sunday afternoon without any issues
---
I solo it all the time and could finish it in 4 minutes with just the jukebox.  Instead about 2/3rds of the way through I let the ghouls break it and instantly repair it but don’t turn it back on.  That still pulls the ghouls and I let the timer run down another 3 minutes as I usually pull 1-2 more legendary, then I turn it back on.  
---
The reason they shortened the time is folks were starting it with the full 25 minutes and doing what I just said and power leveling and farming so they shortened it to closer to what you need.  There is still plenty of cushion, so I am shocked you run out of time.  The jukebox alone can do it, but you never let it stop is the key and then you will have extra time
---
Or giving me diseases through a sniper bullet... That I fired, over a mile away!
---
I can confirm that this happened to me more than once. If I don’t see the event right away and get there a little late it’s a wrap. The timer to start the event never goes away even after starting the event. So if the timer to start the event isn’t still at around 10 minutes you’re gonna have a hard time.
---
Anyone threatening to murder people or their families &amp; pets for any reason IRL is a sociopath I hope they get banned. You did right to report them
---
Pretty sure I used up the entire servers luck with that one lol
---
Do you not have a giant timer above the challenges that let you know when it resets?
---
On PSN if that was recorded and sent to Sony you can expect a hefty ass ban, idk if Steam or Xbox are the same but I imagine so 
---
That guy needs to lighten up, as well, usually people with Bounties are glad to be rid of it as they can see everyone and everyone's camps again..
---
Wait what's wrong with blocker and fireproof?
---
My accuracy is completely broken in VATS. 95% accuracy, point blank range, takes 5 shots to get one hit.
---
Sadly, too many 'people' are consumed with video games and the fantasy life they bring. For most of them, char death in this by someone else (pvp) is many thing. Luck, skills aren't as good as they thought, smarter person, and 'loss of choice'.     
---
Getting so 'upset' (like a child) that you'd make such threats warrants repercussions if this person tries anything. In any court you'd be right in defending yourself. If a person can't distinguish the real world from fantasy they are mentally sick and can be a danger to others.    
---
I don't pvp for many reasons. I've only been killed a few times in 76 mostly from forgetting to turn on Pacifist mode and the few times I got bored and decided to try it. The odds of him/her finding you isn't zero. People like that have lost a lot of rational thinking.    
---
On a similar note, a face model for 'that char' in The Last of Us 2 got death threats a couple of days ago. I've seen the tweets and it's idiotic behavior to do that.
---
Like UPS? FedEx? ...Postmates?
---
Adding the short scope option (only like 5o gold) raised my accuracy from 33 to 49% and make a note with the extended barrel you can reach 120 with this gun so a scope is relevant.
---
Add action girl/boy to the list as well please.  Can confirm it is broken.  Tested it last night.
---
I used to gather duplicate keys thinking I could drop them for friends to save them time on the unmarked grind treasure hunts... Alas I couldn't.
---
To stop those with way more time to play getting ALL of the things in days and being able to dictate prices. Could you imagine how much stuff someone who plays 16 hours a day could get? They'd have all the good weapons and armour. 
---
a lot of games like this have caps on things. It's absolutely nothing new.
---
new systems and new games will be out. once those are around, one misstep and im out. they really should think long and hard about what they want to do. they have a few months to figure it out.
---
As far as I can tell blocker just does not do anything anymore after the patch.  I have not tested fireproof yet.
---
Could you die? There’s a bug right now that causes you do desync from the server. When this occurs you cannot die and you cannot gain XP. You can only get out of this bug by killing yourself by drinking dirty water until the rads get you. Once you do that though, all the XP you should have gained will come to you (if you didn’t already log out)
---
You have to scrap the horns by hand first
---
Good Strategy.  I'm gonna do this from now on.  Upvoted.
---
Yeah you too
---
i just started playing Sunday, and am just running around doing my main quest. last night when i was traveling to a new point i randomly entered a public event and usually i leave since im lvl7 i can't help too much, but only saw one guy and decided to stay and complete the event. this isn't really a great story but the random survivor that was 150 at the event kept running over to make sure i was cool on my plant and helped kill stuff and even dropped me a sweet gun! was really happy to see people not being richards :D
---
Rip serum salesmen if this happened
---
Oh how about 1 shotting a ghoul from 10 ft away "contracted rad worms"  How TF does that work?
---
When you have a song stuck in your head, just imagine the song ending, like an outro / final drum roll or something. That seems to do it for me :)
---
Yeah, people aren't too bright these days. I've had death threats over a freaking *story*. Like a literal piece of fiction. If your life is so fucked up that you can't even handle a freaking *plot twist* not going your way, you need to gtfo the internet and seek therapy.
---
Yeah, I would have got that in a heartbeat as im always getting cranberries. Also, itd show up as being a crossed out atom shop item you dont have when you are in your camp build mode. Never saw anything like that when going through all the lists.
---
aye
---
Thank you! Why do you have to do this for buy and not with other junk items tho? You can use a desk fan without scrapping it so why does bone need scrapping first?
---
Nvidia Control Panel - Manage 3D Settings
---
1. Select a program to customise: Add Fallout76.exe
---
2. Specify the settings for this program: Scroll down to bottom of list, then set:
---
Feature = ***Vertical sync***  Setting = ***Fast***
---
This removed stuttering for my system
---
GTX 750 ti i5 4670k 16GB ram
---
Game settings Medium, texture to high, shadow depth to low, shadow quality to medium.
---
I can confirm this.  Will edit OP.
---
Well damn. I've just started a new character and switched from a stealth commando to an in your face Shotgunner/heavy gunner/melee (strength). Blocker was one of the main perks I wanted to use. That and fireproof. And adrenaline....
---
Try dropping all of your bone on the ground and then pick it backup again. For some reason sometimes scrap glitches and this works to fix it.
---
 This happened to me a couple times with diffent scrap but a very very long time ago, not sure if its the same bug or not.
---
&gt;My friends and I have already reported him and hopefully other players he may have done this to will have reported him as well. I will not be posting their IGN due to the rules.
---
And this is how you discuss such behavior without breaking subreddit rules.
---
Good on ya, Auditore345. Bene!
---
This, I was dealing with a griefer that was being an asshat to a friend of mine's wife, they were in PA and is wanted to test how different guns work, Handmade is ehh, my GP works surprisingly well even though I'm specced for rifles and it's used for Queens, the DCG works well as it causes the player to panic and he was killed easier cause of it
---
Guy was an idiot and deserved to have 4 of us kick his ass lol 
---
Just to clarify, we do not do PvP unless in defence of another player I still believe it has no place in Fallout but it is what it is
---
It's a "special ingredient", like assaultron heads, that don't scrap automatically
---
I've got about 15 if you want one, lol
---
You are doing something very wrong. How much ram do you have? I have a similar build to yours and the game runs smooth as hell.
---
Good advice.
---
Awesome. Thank you.
---
Blocker does nothing, Fireproof works 50% of the time.  But the other 50% of the time you just insta die from SB's.
---
Thank for your sollutions but someone else in the comments told me I needed to scrap the bone first. Weird that I have to scrap bone but not a desk fan for example
---
###THIS ENCRYPTID AIN'T FREEEEEEEE
---
Omfg grinding this has been my life for like 2 months 
---
Ty for proof it actually exists
---
I see. That explains it
---
I didnt know about this skin. Good on you for slaying your outfit.
---
People are so quick to complain without just looking first.
---
An absolute must for me is Perk Loadout Manager. And I use some inventory mgmt mods.
---
It did with FFXIV. You can't play the new DLC without finishing the previous ones. They have level gated content and it works.
---
Aye. sorry. i was talking about crafting. cos i'm an idiot.
---
Cheers, I’m currently maxing out my
---
Shotgun perk cards so gonna buy the shotgun later and give it a go. Got the mini gun and it’s brilliant
---
That was my first guess also, but also wanted to give them the benefit of doubt and thought it's all because of player exploits, hoping it might get lifted along the way, or atleast increased.
---
Still wondering if it's there from day 1 or it was added later tho...
---
But still ... smh.
---
Well that’s them giving you a plot twist. Not an acceptable plot twist though.
---
Yeah, I have only played one playthrough but I took my time.  I wanted to experience the world and its stories, not just rush rush rush to level up and beat the SBQ and bolt off to the next thing.  I don't see the point in playing that way, but I know everyone's different.
---
I could have sworn the key ring was something that was in the base game of Fallout 4 at launch already, so not seeing it here was a head scratcher. Would really want to see something like a key ring implemented again, as those are one of the few classes of items with no weight to speak of and are basically just physical representations of progress checkpoints, so you'd never want non-duplicates out of your inventory anyway.
---
Crimson Prospect. 
---
Its between Dropsite G3 and Ranger Office.
---
They are immune but the Explosive effect still doubles the fire rate against them.
---
Challenges update at 12 noon EDT
---
Everytime
---
It is an event. Watching them.vanish before your eyes. Its the greatest event in all of fallout76
---
So fireproof is broken? Makes sense because I had a harder time out healing explosive lasers than Tesla guns 🤦‍♂️
---
All of a sudden,  my heavy build is moot.
---
Thanks for making this post.  We haven't had a dev comment on anything in over 5 days so it would be nice for them to come here and acknowledge all of these different perks as I believe they have only acknowledged adrenaline at this point according to the dev tracker.
---
When you start struggling with ammo you
---
&gt;Switch to melee
---
&gt;Dupe
---
Were they mostly mounted creature plans?
---
Cool. Idea.
---
Or perhaps utilise this empty 2 stars? I see 5 stars are available, but 3 stars are the only Obtainable ones.
---
Hoo man. You should read Troll Hunting by Ginger Gorman. It's terrifying how many of these pricks have partners and steady, well-earning jobs. Hidden in plain fucking sight.
---
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
---
Honestly I've never liked the bog, I usually drop my nukes on either white springs or monongah
---
Easy there. Pls don't come with logic
---
It costs folks like you and me
---
I had the same happen yesterday in the swamp.  Just pull out your camera and it will get you a fix on the lost legendary.
---
You get so many in nuclear winter, have you worked your way towards some of those later paints and skins?
---
Lol ff14 is an mmo with an amazing story and a ton of stuff to do.  Fallout has what 10 shitty events.  Awful daily’s.  I’m really getting into this game but plz don’t compare this game to an mmo,  when at best do 76 is a sandbox rpg.  Also ff14 gives you a free upgrade in lvl and story progression up to dlc or you can flat out buy it off mpg store.
---
Hahaha oh god.. the old Hanging Grenade levelling trick.. someone just returned from a very long break! 😂
---
I'm honestly skipping NW challenges. Currently at 20/100 so I guess it's alright.
---
I've never got into that mode but people here is always talking about how bad it is. Hackers and stuff.
---
Yeah, this is a way bigger deal than most realize.  Bethesda seriously needs to get a hotfix out quickly as this cripples many builds.  Maybe if we get enough activity ITT somebody will notice who can make things happen.  They might not even be aware that some of these perks don't work.
---
Adding a virus to your game to weed out the less than 1%? What a brilliant idea!
---
My 3 man team runs it at least once per day. Usually one of us has a card because they are a good cap sink or we jump to it if someone else starts it. We usually go in with a strategy, one friend takes all 3 pylons, one keeps aggro on the ISS and I take her out with my low health Junkie stealth commando. Everybody gets a hit and she usually goes down within a few minutes. If there are a bunch of others there, I'll remove some rads so that I can take a pylon since it is more likely to be complete chaos and the three of us will each take one if they are not active.
---
Most of the nw skins work on ultracite like outcast, pink barbie sprinkles,  the doughnut one and the camo one.
---
Yeah that shit's a chore.  No one WANTS to, that's for sure.
---
What's wrong with Actiom Boy? It and Adrenaline were the only Agility perks I had, so I have this horrible sense of dread.
---
I hope they fix the conversion rate. 10k of 5mm converts into 522 of .45. That's insulting if they think we're going to go through with that.
---
Haha.. sorry man.  Action boy does absolutely NADA.
---
No, there is probably no point. But you are "supposed to". Kind of like that certain part of a process at work that no one really checks or cares about, but is still something you're supposed to
---
Yea it’s always fun helping others. The other day I was doing Line in the Sand with a level 49 and once he hit 50 I gave him a 2 star Furious Ultracite Gatling I’ve been meaning to sell to replace his base one. Great reactions from him. 
---
You and your son are doing great! We really need this kind of spirit in these communities.
---
Favorite people in 76. Gail cracks me up.
---
Right, ones through achievements, but not in the atom store like a host of other camos for instance?
---
And that's not even mentioning the t65
---
This is the hardest thing to get past - just trashing / junking / not keeping stuff. 
---
First I sold all my aid items I wasn't using to get caps. New quest rewards keep you silly fully of purified water, radaway, rad-x and stims. 
---
Then when I hit my cap max, I put them in my vendor.
---
But then, I have a weight problem ... so drop / gift / junk it is.
---
For now, gather tons of honey and eat it like candy.  It helps a bit.
---
Potentially they could but you would be watching and could kick them off anytime. This would absolutely be the safest way to go
---
Hah!  that'll give me an excuse to use my 400+ honey i have in my inventory xD
---
Can you add -how- each is broken? Just saying "shit's broke" doesn't help anyone pinpoint the problem.
---
**Woosh**
---
 Blocker does nothing, Fireproof seems to only work 50% of the time.
---
Amazing, isn't. Sometimes, the best gaming moments are with friends and family.  Or strangers treated as friends, as your son is learning.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s one of the dailies to get score points. Kekeke
---
Yeah, for some reason, the base item "nuclear material" in Fallout 4 was renamed to "nuclear waste", but crafting still calls for the Fallout 4 name. I guess the junk component (technically different from the item, I think) wasn't renamed? I'm not sure why, but I've gotten used to it.
---
Just gonna pretend i didnt create multiple chars just for additional storage (stims, alc, *-weapons/gear) :')
---
I have that countdown timer shown above my challenges. It does a pretty good of letting me know when daily or weekly challenges reset.
---
So the economy doesn’t get fucked. It’s about putting an edge on inflation in game.
---
Wasteland Karens strike again!
---
Adaptive wont be better?
---
I always use Chemist to create 2x stimpaks from blood packs, and then sell stimpaks. Making diluted and selling it doesn't sound round by me. :) 
---
All I'm saying Chemist is good.
---
Lol i'm obviously used to that stuff but... It's sad
---
I personally like queen cause of treasury notes and repair kits, and I know that I can expect 2 or 3 additional legendary creatures during the fight
---
A big whimp of a Super Mutant who basically stood around holding his minigun without firing a shot during the quest and that annoying ass kid you just wanted to use some military grade tape to shut her up.  I was so happy to be done with that quest.
---
I love my Instigating Explosive Lever, it always gets the job done until the bosses come out.
---
Yeah, it's pretty silly how frequently you get diseases.  I just gave up curing them for the most part (except Rattle Hands) since you're just gonna turn around and immediately get another one away.
---
Sounds like a horrible person that doesn't like there being consequences to his actions. They hide and snipe off people coming into a highly traveled area, the game puts a bounty on their head, cuz in a game whose core message is collaboration killing others is a bad thing, telling you what you did is wrong, and then you find the person who killed you and threaten them irl for something they did in a video game as a response to you being a bad person in the game. 
---
Given the sounds of the threats this person might actually be a danger to society.
---
I have fought sb's and not been hurt by them and been caught in car blasts that would definitely kill my other character that have done almost nothing to this one, so can't say through my experience fireproof is broken but I have probably just been lucky with that 50% in favour in that case. Blocker and action boy are really disappointing though, as if adrenaline wasn't bad enough.
---
Also, you can just craft the excavator set at any PA station. Find one with the frame and craft the pieces on it in situ. It doesnt have to be crafted at the Garrahan mining HQ. Though you need to take it there afterwards.
---
Things that make it believable this is a hacker:
---
* the teammates' behavior - they definitely know it's a hacker. Either they know the hacker, or they're randoms who know they won't get good gameplay anyway so why bother.
---
* perfect aim with every kill
---
* got enemies who were hiding in water (it takes a non-hacker careful searching to find them)
---
Things that make it not believable this is a hacker:
---
* 3 shots someone (bc if you're hacking anyway you may as well be doing one-shots)
---
Things that are probably irrelevant details:
---
* 18 kills (achievable using a nuke and/or by just being *insanely* good and lucky)
---
* never jumped or took cover (some people are just crazy confident)
---
My opinion is it was probably a hacker, but definitely a bad one if it took him 3 shots to kill anybody.
---
Uhuh, when the stuff you buy with gold and the stuff you make from said plans is not even tradeable, how can you dictate prices?
---
Scrip, ok, too much powah - but still has an element of RNG to it. 
---
And yeah, there always are "softcaps", I get that. Played so many MMO's/MP games in my life that I know. But never have I ever seen a cap on the game's main currency. Now even if you get around that by trading with other players, you still cannot hold more than 30k caps?
---
This is just being lazy on bethesda's part, and admitting there's not much to do beyond the grind. And even if you do get everything there is to get, what exactly are you supposed to use it for? SBQ and ... oh that's it...
---
^^^^^^^^^^
---
This right here. Specifically those repair kits.
---
Caps is first, in their inventory. 
---
Ammo is second! 
---
So double tap E before they touch the ground.
---
They do, however since the start of May they've literally been putting the same things out over and over. You'd think there was nothing else for them to release lol.
---
You hit li- *\*shotgun blast to the torso that explodes him into bloody chunks\** \-ke a molerat!
---
\*One of the giblet chunks plays the death sound.\*
---
Chances are his behavior was why he had a bounty to begin with.
---
These are also the Chads that are now pissed that forced-Team-PvP got removed so they can't exploit it anymore and that only want PvP as long as it means for them to steamroll low-lvl players but are out of 'PvP' as soon as an actual battle would occur.
---
Good you reported that trashcan, OP!
---
My PA weighs 0 unless they have changed that?
---
I never used weight reduction perks in X-01.
---
I had about 250 spare space with what I needed for my build.
---
PA leaves a lot of perk points free and nothing to use em for 🤷‍♂️
---
Ok thanks
---
They do nothing at all, apart from fireproof which does nothing randomly.
---
He's probably roleplaying Blood Eagles. Psychos.
---
use the camera
---
When I open up Nvidia CP and click the “manage 3D” I’m not seeing a option to select a program.
---
"Key ring and inventory optimization coming with the next Fallout 1st Prime premium subscription!"
---
Thank you for the info, for some reason I thought it buffed the weapons I crafted only and  then I could remove it  but still keep the buff glad everyone on here has managed to clear that up for me :)
---
It's also an extremely restrictive sandbox rpg that literally relies only on limits instead of content to keep people playing.
---
i enjoy it to loot floaters before they explode...
---
kill from distance, run run run, loot loot loot, run run run...
---
What card, I don't understand?
---
My tattered dress that grants 1per, will never come off. Except when i absolutely must wear a hazmat suit, but feck, i hate not having ma dress on.
---
MP/MMO economy tends to self-regulate, if the studio doent's fuck it with means of buying the in-game currency (look at GTA V).  
---
And even then it can work (look at EVE, it's as close to a real-world market at is gets)
---
The NPC vendor prices are steep as-is, and you get what, 1/10th of the price when you trade with vendors as it is. 
---
I would get diminishing returns - the more you do something on a timer, the less you get out of it. That's an effective way to gate off the most notorious grinders. And that's the way most online games go with.
---
Cheers. Sent you a private message with details
---
I play this game 85% of the time with a disease, its annoying.
---
That's a good perspective, very zen. With your first comment it did sound like you encouraged people to cheat though
---
I think some people get so immersed or are so arrogant IRL that they go on a power trip and when they meet someone with the ability to kill them it shatters their illusion that they are the best there is the best there was and the best there every will be and they just can't handle it
---
Nice, thought of doing something similar using the seedy shack or teh log cabin prebuilt structure.
---
The only two that are worth anything are the Build and Event teams. Use Build for the intelligence to level faster while launching a nuke. Then switch over to Event to run the event or switch right before it completes to get the xp. Switch back to Build, rinse and repeat. What would a Scrap Farming team give you, XP? Get that from a Build team. I'm sure they sat down and thought of all possibilities for different team types and settled on these because they make the most sense to have. I only see Build and Event teams so obviously that's what works, no need to change it. The focus right now is farming XP for the legendary run, doesn't matter how you get it.
---
I put my stealth suit on and take all 3 pylons every time. I have stimpak supers favoured on my weapons wheel. All I do to ensure I get rewards is shoot it as soon as it appears like within the first second of the event starting before pylons are even active and I get the loot then
---
Thanks for clarifying I was wondering this as well.
---
That is true, there aren't any purchase paints for the ultracite.  Although t65 is getting new paints from the Legendary run
---
I'm down to test my build but not if you live in another country.
---
Lag kills the fun in PvP.
---
I'm on PC so I'll miss out on learning of all of my mom's new lovers.
---
You could argue that it was done to make it more challenging but I suspect it was the same fun police who nerfed WesTek.
---
hello, can i have a copy of your tool?
---
The majority of the FO player base want nothing to do with pvp.
---
That is why survival was removed. It is also why they try to force adventure mode players to play NW by dangling shiny adventure stuff and s.c.o.r.e points in front of them as rewards.
---
Agreed. If killing some ghouls is more valuable to players than finishing the event succesfully, there is something wrong with it.
---
Countdown Timers: How Do They Work?
---
There is a video called fallout 76 greenhouse by norespawns, watch it at the end you'll see what I mean
---
Fo76 already started with, go here-press X- go there-open container-press X- bring back
---
Imagine how boring that fishing would be
---
pretty much any online game with PVP. PVP "purists" are some of the most toxic people i have ever seen, be it Fallout, Runescape, WoW, ESO, Rust, whatever.
---
Unless they do a huge inventory wipe to get all hacked, broken and duped items and weapons out of the game the caps will probably stay
---
I agree, as soon as you become at least one conduit the game should give you the loot of the imposter. Maybe then players will also try to learn how the event works.
---
Not sure on that, but only you see the custom names not the other players. 
---
Sometimes when opening a trade you can catch a glimpse of the custom names, but they always switch to normal.
---
Who does It work?
---
This is how I built my first (and so far only) camp! I want to pick a new spot soon and was thinking about askint the nukashine gods again lol.
---
It's a plant. If you watch a video called fallout 76 greenhouse by norespawns, at the end, you'll see what I'm talking about
---
Months? I'm solo leveling 10 levels per day after work and I'm level 310(which requires more exp to level up)
---
If it something like rdr2 or Minecraft I think it would be relaxing.
---
The ghillie suit has been great for the "bush wookies", I find d a good bush, photomode and do the laying out pose. Have had other players walk right over me🤣
---
Wouldn't say FF14 has an amazing story personally. Bored me to death and couldn't have cared less about it.
---
A lot of games have capped currency. A big one for me was destiny. If caps would be high cap then prices would be way higher for things since caps are the most duped thing.
---
Bethesda have no clue how to online, copied mobile f2p gacha game models.
---
Saw it coming while Todd was still on the stage. Wonder why a cohort of players and fans coming from a series of open world action role-playing video games were so against it...
---
I've hit the limit (50) before, but it didn't bug out on me.  Maybe remove all custom names and start over?
---
Wow, all 8 points of Agility wasted. I'll have to respec next time I play.
---
All the legendaries before scrip I just left unlooted at WS golf club because they're weren't TS or Vanguards...
---
Theres per hit caps on how much damage you can do in pvp. get a specced out bowieknife instead, pvp as a melee is all about hitting the dmg cap with the fastest swingspeed possible.
---
Honestly people need to realize not all weapons are created equal when it comes to ammo efficiency.  I use heavy weps and some of them are very ammo thirsty, such as the flamer, minigun, 50 cal, LMG.  Flamer isn't even worth talking about.
---
The minigun, while a helluva lot of fun will eat 10x-50x the ammo that my gatling gun that can 1 or 2 shot stuff.
---
Also - ultracite ammo can be surprisingly efficient because the batches are all larger.  The LMG is pointless with normal .308 that comes in batches of 12 but all of a sudden it's one of the most efficient heavy guns in terms of steel/lead/gunpowder if you slap a prime receiver on it and craft ultracite ammo.
---
Skimmed through and just saw tatos and the carnivorious plant if thats what you were looking at there. Just a decoration and cant get anything from it.
---
This would be playable if they removed bushes. Best way to win in a PvP mode is to not PvP lol.
---
Omg imagine writing an entire Reddit post because some kid flamed you in a video game.
---
This sub is something else.
---
At the very end those giant pink plants he has put front of his house
---
You wont be banned for opening them even though they are definitely duped.
---
 Personally I would have never picked them up but that's just me.
---
 I do not believe in cheating, exploiting, hacking, duping or anything that was never intended in this game. I see no fun in those activities. Just like in RL I like earning what i have.
---
That is a very specific request lol. Ok, i will do that.
---
I'm pretty sure TLDR existed before Reddit though.
---
You can try Dyer Chemical over in the Mire. I used to farm there back in the day because there was a ton of robo brains bots that would almost always drop fusion cores. I think they changed it though as I haven't seen too many there. Can't be having too much fun now can we? It's part of the reason why I stopped using PA.
---
Well i was obviously not talking about the stuff you make with bullion.
---
If there was no cap on caps prices would get higher and higher. People started using trade goods to get around it. 
---
Without the cap there'd be people out there with hundreds of millions of caps. And they'd just outbid everyone for everything. Or they dominate markets by buying all of a certain type of thing and then they control the prices. 
---
And besides it gets to a certain point and you just don't need caps anymore. At the minute as soon as i get near 20k caps i go buy random plans from npc vendors. Just to get rid of them.
---
Look at 17:22 in the video, those pink glowing plants in front is what I was saying when is said cranberry bog tree planters. A few already said it was a spring bundle item
---
Line in the Sand awards two 100% fusion cores.  Perfect for players that don’t use power armor often.
---
Yep, thats the carnivorous plant from the atom shop.
---
Force the RNG to produce another number. Literally exit VATS wait 1/4 second then try again. Sounds like voodoo but works for me.
---
Carnivorous? What?
---
HARDCORE! I never use the steering in my car or the door in my house.
---
I love plague walker. I always have two or more diseases at a time.
---
More like fixes 1 thing breaks 10.
---
Jesus fucking Christ how much shit do you guys hoard? Never had this happen to me.
---
Yes!!  I'm glad to hear there are others.  lol
---
https://imgur.com/rB8DbYQ
---
I had absolutely no idea. So just because my gauntlet shreds in pve doesn't mean it will in PvP? I've been doing it all wrong lol
---
I have been doing mobile camps for a year. They are a pain because of "object is floating" issue. I found the best way is to place one object, blueprint it, remove the whole thing. And try to place it. If it fails, place earlier blueprint and try again. 
---
The structure items like the shed, greenhouse, camper, circus trailer help so much though. But still, if a single bench even slightly clips into another bench, the whole thing fails. 
---
They really need to fix the placing blueprints bug.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnpyno/mappalachia_now_with_maps_of_flux/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
 This is a nice handy map of where you can nuke for your kind of flux.
---
If you're looking for Flux, Harpers Ferry is also a really good spot to nuke - especially for violet (lots of ferns around).
---
You can do several circuits of HF for the mobs - and get a lot of ingredients to stabilize the flux you get.
---
In practice, the mechanic being "reworked" would most likely just mean its removal, similarly to that of hunger and thirst in patch 22. That would be in line with other generally unpopular "survival" elements gradually disappearing from the game since launch. Although there is other content like challenges and mutations that depend on diseases, so that may be a reason for developers to decide in favor of keeping them.
---
Just black Xs on the mini map
---
If you're on a public world (and it's only laggy in public) get the hell of that world because this a red flag that there are too many players doing too much stuff and it may well crash soon.
---
*licks finger, puts it in the air*
---
"Yep, server crash a comin' from the west boys best get hopping on another world."
---
Thanks for that.
---
I literally had no idea.
---
Penis
---
I'm pretty sure Blocker is working, at least for me. The ISS isn't doing any more damage to me that she used to &amp; Ghouls aren't either.
---
Ah. So whenever I go through a log tree forest down there, is that what all that red mist is they shoot out?
---
Very cool!
---
If you're fast at switching perks, yes.
---
I run bloodied power fist  &amp; bloodied gatling
---
Just takes 3 perk cards in STR to swap depending on what I'm doing.
---
Hey, real life serial killers to-be play this game too. Think you found one.
---
They do need to remove the first timer, now that the second (shorter) timer is actually the one people should be paying attention to. And I've only had the event fail once recently - and the weird this was, there were tons of people playing instruments (at least 5) and the jukebox was going - yet the "bar" barely moved &amp; the event failed.
---
Must have been a glitch.
---
Same and I don’t use fireproof- I do use blocker.
---
The food can keep the rads. I just want to be able to use purified water or boiled.
---
u/CM_PipBoy for your reference.
---
Hahaha, well done brother. Hopefully that'll teach them to mess with players :)
---
And from the snallys and Grafton Monster that are literally right next to Hemlock Holes.
---
You lose junk when you die. Do you mean no junk on the ground when you respawn?
---
No, its a feature of the game. the price you pay for dying. This is intentional. Has to be an incentive NOT to die, and thats it.
---
You have to pick up your junk when you die. It’ll show up on your map (along with the skull and crossbones icon) and on your quests as “pick up your dropped loot”  😊
---
Yep. Doesnt hurt you though. When I first had that happen it scared the shit out of me and I booked it out of the grove right quick as I didnt know what was going on.
---
Part of the game. You drop your junk when you die. You can go back and pick it up, but so can other players.
---
For one, people use wood armor. You must not be into the trading scene at all, otherwise you’d know that. Why there’s a T45 skin is pretty self explanatory. 
---
&gt;Atleast put stuff in that people can use
---
So you’ve pointed out two skins that *you* personally don’t use, and are trying to pass it off as “no one uses them” lol. That’s not a real arguement. 
---
I think I was pretty clear though when I said **this is how battle passes work**.
---
santatron was in the store for free during christmas, and it collected toys and candy. i suspect it will be back this year since it was quite popular, being free and all as well as giving some holiday life to your camp.
---
there was also a communist one that collected food and weapons, though rarely, and a Fasnacht one that i think collected booze. pretty sure both were also 500 atoms.
---
you can only have one collectron at your camp at a time, but if you own multiple you can set one to collect something from another. i have my Communist collectron collecting toys cuz i think it's funny to be told to join the proletariat and be given a baseball glove lol
---
Acid and Lead are the things I have an abundance of. It's steel I keep lacking 😂
---
If you have junk on you when you die, it should drop on your death point. Typically you also get a misc. marker to recover your lost loot.
---
Cheers
---
Hah definitely. I also love killing scorch beasts in the air and then trying to run and “catch” their body when they nose dive into the ground, it’s fun. Bonus points for when they bounce back up and you get to run and catch them again.
---
Adrenaline, Fireproof, Action Boy all working as intended for me.
---
No bug. All junk you carry around drops in a bag where you died and you need to retrieve it again.
---
Tip: Either stash regularly or don’t die.
---
You always drop your junk when you die.  Look for a brown bag.  Also there is a miscellaneous quest telling you to retrieve your junk.
---
i'd wait to spend them. in about a week you can use them to rank up in the seasonal event, and i'd hold onto them till the last few days of the season to snag any rank rewards you wiuld have missed
---
Are you talking about yesterday’s challenges? Today hasn’t reset for anyone - got about 3 hours to go.
---
And all that time you're still desperately trying to catch the ***Whoopsies*** so you can complete the damn challenge!
---
Congratulations. You have obtained your first Magic shotgun.
---
Certain legendary mods cause shotgun hits in Vats to do enormously more dmg than intended. Any armor piece with bash dmg will cause it, +33% vats hit chance on the gun itself will cause it. There are others too.
---
Watch AngryTurtle's  OP shotguns vid for more details.
---
I drop everyday all the plans I get and I already know in the green suitcase at Morgantown station. If there's a low level player nearby I give him advice
---
As far as earty vugs go it's the eartiest, most vugged one in the game.
---
I agree that he should have said something to you but for me I honestly don't care if it's someone's alt character I just hate it when someone swoops in to get a loot bag they obviously know wasn't for them.
---
I bought 2 deep pocket plans.
---
Thinking i might have needed to purchase another plan for Limbs.
---
Duhhhhhhhhhh on my part :-(
---
Rule #1
---
The "expectation" is that you *won't*. 
---
They **expect** that you will **have to pay** to get all the rewards, especially the end ones; as most people won't have the time or luxury to complete it on their own, at their ease.
---
It's how a lot of battle passes work, and I hate it. I usually give up on games that require that much of a timesink; and I'm also surprised the subreddit isn't more upset about the top tier reward being recycled Creation Club content.
---
[I just want to be a Space Cowboy, but I have a feeling when I get finally get this PA paint that it won't even be an available option to mod](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Cowboy)
---
This VV
---
Bwhaaaaaaaaaaa.
---
It has been a total waste of time for me. Total fail. That menu system is like something my cat programmed on a ZX81.
---
It was not mine, and it was one .dll that no longer works.
---
This game badly need an API.
---
The only t65 specific paint is the one from the legendary run, and ultracite is getting that same paint. All the nw paints besides the infernos work on ultracite
---
Not sure what you mean by not mentioning the t65
---
Thanks, Master! :D Info about lead will come handy one day. I usually just collected all the (s)crap containing lead or used workshops to get it. I love how people of the FO community are sharing locations, tips, items, etc. It's the greatest feature of this game. The one created by its community. I can only imagine what heights it would reach if players hub happen to exist in this game one day...
---
"He was sitting on top of the Whitespring station firing his gun away at players coming in at the spawn point" - Just WTF. He had started a pretty shady pvp activity by his own choice then complaining about it?
---
Also IRL death threat over something like this in a video game is nonsense.
---
(I installed OBS just in case to start quick recording in case. I had similar experience sadly.)
---
Morgantown is quite nice. Has plenty glowing ones and a good amount of cobalt flux.
---
Beside the usual Bog and WS, Harpers Ferry and Charleston aren‘t bad either imo
---
Noted.  Hoping to get more feedback on this one so that we can determine if it actually works, or if something has changed.  I'm told that it only works while standing, but I'm not sure.
---
I honestly think they dont care. From my observations many are high levels so theyve been around long enough to know. Currently everyone seems obsessed with xp because of the Legendary Run. And I get it. I am more fervent about it than  i would normally be too. The issue is if the event fails then you miss out on the event xp and rewards. If you are in a Events team then you are wasting your time because no double event xp for you. And its not just this event that has problems with it. Just had Radiation Rumble fail because everyone farmed the ghouls and not enough people collected ore.
---
I ain't no money-doctor, but so what?
---
The prices would potentially go higher, but would stabilize in time. Only the "shiny new stuff" would then be steep, the rest would get cheaper and cheaper... 
---
Plus the end-result for you, selling the stuff, is still the same, when you list something and it sells, what matter is it to you that the individual would just relist it at 2x, 3x, 10x or 100x the price? You still made your caps, right? 
---
The reasonable outweight the unreasonable. But perhaps, taking into consideration that we have a server-based "micro" economy, it would not work. But I tend to lean towards the "it might work" rather than "it's a lost cause, people are hyenas".
---
No. The only options are to get another gunsmith card up to level 4 and use that, or start a new character. It's a pain in the genitals.
---
I didn't compare this game to an MMO, I just stated how level gated content can work. Yes this game is a sandbox rpg but it's starting to slip into mobile game territory with the atom store and being able to spend real money to speed up the legendary run. If the game board only had cosmetics on it, it wouldn't be a big deal but it has currencies. You're paying real money for in game currencies, something that other games will ban you for if you use one of those sites where you buy in game currency from sweatshop farmers. The repair kits and scrap kits were the start of it. What if you pay real money for atoms, spend the atoms on the legendary run, get scrip, use that scrip at the Purveyor and roll a god tier weapon? Now, those and these currencies aren't necessarily pay to win, but it's starting to head down that path. Something Bethesda swore they would never do, just like Fallout 1st. I think they've reversed course on this because of low sales due to bad reviews. FFXIV has more content because it's a mandatory subscription, it's no wonder why it's always in the top two of best MMOs to play.
---
When I get on later, I'll do dual runs of Encryptid (one with Blocker &amp; the other without) and get a better sense of any changes.
---
Get 4 more Gunsmith cards from level ups and upgrade them to 4. You can't break down a higher rank card, sadly.
---
Action boy is definitely not working for me.  I timed my ap regen with and without it, and there was no change.  Maybe something is different between our builds.. mutations perhaps.  Hope we can get more feedback on this.
---
I’m starting to become a believer in this. Bought gold on 3 characters Sunday. Tried to buy gold on my main yesterday and I get the come next week bs.
---
No not at this moment, you’d just have to use 4 levels to loop back and get gunsmith rank 4 as well and keep the rank 5 one.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought this.  I do like the character, but yeah, she is basically Tina.
---
That theres now literally 1 paint job for it? I wonder why they can retroactively or simply add familiar paint jobs to the ultracite and t65
---
8GB of RAM is cutting it fine TBH - you're only really leaving about 4GB on top of Windows footprint to use without paging. What resolution are you running and what texture settings? CPU is almost irrelevant for running just one instance but consider going for another 8GB at a fraction of the cost of your GPU. I have 24GB for the sole purpose of running 2 instances comfortably. Memory usage can sometimes reach 10GB for me per instance.
---
I never need to use the Geforce optimisations (as I know what I consider important) but you are going to have to compromise on what the 1660ti can output without more RAM.
---
You do NOT NEED to start switching off grass and stuff in the .INI file with your card.
---
Ballz, that is immensely stupid, I will just give up action boy 2 to 1 and transfer 1 point from agility
---
That’s why I’ve been putting off finishing the main quest for myself personally. I wanna enjoy it, not feel like I gotta plow through it to start my bullion grind :&lt;
---
Thanks. Please post your results.
---
i usually get a big grin when looting a supermutants HEAD and finding three loose screws in it...
---
Its a cruel world...
---
At least u understood what he was saying... im always getting insulted by russians and have no idea what they are saying.
---
God bless them russians!
---
It’s energy. You have to have science to craft them and they are in the energy slot for crafting.
---
now all that is left is getting yourself a ghoul slayer gamma gun. the one and only true end game weapon to collect.
---
1 my med pump armor bugs out and I die. 
---
2 my weapon switch bugs and instead of my gauss shotgun, I switch to my axe. I’m not perked out for my axe and die. 
---
3 When I have 3-5 workshops and the server gets disconnected
---
SAME, tho I’m alittle irked that new “content” is just the same exact old guns but with higher power caps.
---
A Zetan focused season, not just one thing in another season.
---
1,000 Up votes!
---
Wow
---
Omg same here. I was like "WTF IS THAT!"
---
But I'm fucking short on caps. There is a 10mm SMG drum mag mod that's 1k caps and I only got 359
---
When I did the event I lagged out of the shitty sever and got nothing so yeah it could’ve been worse
---
I typically skip skins (guns, PA, outfits). I know I’ve know I’ve bought the succulent set, Fasnacht Collectron , contemporary bundle, Mothman Plushie backpack (this was the one exception I made), and the community fire pit. 
---
A few others but I can’t think of them at the moment. 
---
Furthermore, You can still get a decent amount of atoms from the base game challenges. I’m level 99, and I still haven’t got them all.
---
imo Fallout 4 would have been 1000 time better if the actually had the items shown in the concept art and didnt cut a lot of content from the game
---
It is a change to abandom auto with 30k kills :)
---
Gotcha I was miss understanding. I was thinking you were saying t65 had/was getting more paints that ultracite pa
---
As a sniper the only rifle I have that does more damage than gauss shotgun is a BE dragon. I now put 3 points into shotguns and swap between skeet shooter and sniper when necessary. Thing is nasty.
---
For caps it’s inflation, if everyone is at the cap limit, caps lose value
---
You can also take over the Converted Munitions Factory Workshop.  There you can make most of the basic ammo types for free. All you need to do is build a couple generators to power the terminal and select which one you want. You can get a couple hundred ammo per hour in the background as you explore and do other things.
---
Hmm. I'll double check this. I've had it working (seemingly) on a char with 18 mutations.
---
Incoming "keyring converter" season reward that lets you combine keys, but at a maximum of 25 keys per ring.  Now you have to locate the correct keyring before unlocking the door, but there's no way to label them so you have to try each keyring one at a time, through an over-engineered system of sub menus.  25 minutes later, you finally open the janitor closet to find a bucket, mop, and some abraxo.
---
I’m originally a commando build but wanted to test the minigun out so I’m now a commando/heavy (use minigun for SBQ and handmade/fixer for normal).  As I’ve got near max strength, I was gonna have a play with the shotgun.
---
If it's any consolation...  I forgot I listed 5250x 5mm Rounds in my Vendor for 1 cap each but wanted to keep them with me when I found a 3-star Vampire's Minigun.
---
Yes please (pinging /u/LadyDevann)
---
4 more t45 and excavator got it
---
Its a hit or miss event. 
---
With enough folks joining and every habitat is taken care of it can be a fun event.
---
But mostly it’s waiting for others to join till the timer runs out to start it.
---
I do agree with the level requirement... But I feel 150 is still too high. It should be whatever level you'd naturally reach from finishing the main story + Wastelanders. So, around 70ish (50 for main story + 20 for Wastelanders). 
---
It should be a level accessible to new players for just doing what the game already had to offer without much grind.
---
When I was leveling after the wastelander dlc in PC I had huge issues with inventory/stash management. I had to learn what is a useful aid/junk scrapping/selling weapons/armors I do not use.
---
Now I have mule alts like: legendary weapons for script mule, aid mule, ammo mule, trade mule. So If my main has something in this category either sell it or pass to a mule and now I have no more problems with it.
---
My resolution is 1920x1080 and the texture setting is at ultra. No matter what I change the overall game setting to it usually stays at ultra.If I use NVDIA ex. To optimize the game. It runs so badly. I set it to medium and I still get slight stuttering. It’s almost like the game stops for a split second. I don’t have this issue with any other games. Most games I can run at High but for some reason I can’t fix these slight stutters and pauses.
---
Hmm?
---
Any good drop for keeping the 3 alive?
---
I call them "THICC BOIS".
---
Bro
---
One time a long while ago when I was like level 60 or so I was in power armor at a train station and was scripping my legendaries and put it in all of the armor I was currently using as I didn't realize the equipped icon wouldnt show in Power armor.  In the grand scheme of things all of the pieces were crap but at the time they were the best I had so I was kickin myself for it xD.
---
Just last week I had a spare circus cage trailer plan and accidentally learned it on one of my alts who didn't need it.  Was kind of annoyed cause I would've liked to give it to someone who didn't have it yet.
---
You won’t be disappointed. Mine is just a 1* bloodied and it drops everything within 30 feet like nothing. Just use hip fire or ADS. Don’t vats with it.
---
I see you've discovered the bug with it, as did I. If you mount it on your wall it should be gold but likes to revert to it's default skin once in awhile.
---
Do you have AP regen armor pieces?  If so, how many?  I'm running three.  Maybe I should test it with no armor on.
---
Your not a casual,  let’s be real.   If your doing it legit,  your grinding pretty hard considering your only playing after work.
---
I'm just telling you what it do, not what I like. You're running a super high risk of getting bitched at by toxos if you start Encryptid without being willing to handle the pylons yourself. You'd probably be better off spending your time and caps on something else and getting paid to prep and run SBQs if you want to farm XP and legendaries. You're far more likely to get people who will actually show up and play the event correctly that way.
---
Damnnn! Yeah I’ve done that too..sold all my .45 cuz it had been sitting in my stash forever. Not 20 minutes after someone buys out all my .45 I get the fixer plans at encryptid...
---
--&gt; The same way magnets do, juggaloo.
---
i sure as shit hope so. its pretty sad that you need an extra person involved to give an extra gun to an alt. A problem that exists only because your stash is already full of vendor items, junk or awaiting-scrip (which would also not be a problem if there was no freaking limit).
---
Even a 100-200 lb shared stash would be enough to make it work.
---
I understand the frustration, but removing it really wouldn't be fair on the people that do seriously enjoy NW.
---
Personally, I think there should be 5 adventure dailies, and 5 NW dailies. That way, it caters to both fanbases, and adds extra challenges to those who like to grind both.
---
I forgot about the fixer plan I had in my vendor for 5k caps, somebody bought it when I was at 29k+ caps.
---
Thats a fairly good strategy to bring it together part by part. Didn't think of that. I dont have much hope for fixes regarding the building system tho. But if they ever gonna fix the whole thing one day, you and me and all the others who almost got a doctor title in camp building by now will have to learn everything new lol
---
Noooo! Lol, I’ve done that too. Now I rename anything I’m using.
---
I decided to take a workshop to complete the “build 10 floors/walls/roofs challenge”. I showed up at the workshop and it just said claim the workshop which usually implies that it’s unowned and the enemies have already been cleared. So I stake my claim and the owner showed up to my surprise. I thought no one owned it as it didn’t show owned on the map either. So we battle for the workshop. I get two kills on my opponent and then they’re team shows up. I get a kill on their team, they get a fair kill on me. This went on for about 10 minutes before I decided to take a different workshop simply to complete a challenge. The pvp was fun. They were fighting back, seeking revenge, using (what I call) FairPlay weapons, considerably higher levels than me, and having me outnumbered, and because of all that I assumed all was well in the universe. After I split I get a text message over Xbox from one of the guys that labeled “potentially offensive content”. Well... I gotta open that. “What’s your f*ckin problem bro?!” I didn’t reply because The smartass in me really wanted to say “I just wanna build ten floors real quick” or “well you fought back and sought revenge... kinda how that works.”
---
And some people will let you die so they can steal your junk. Those people i like to call twats.
---
the entire game downloads anyway, the disc is just like the installer/key or whatever
---
I always make sure to drop a few random items or plans whenever I see low level players buying stuff from my vendor machines. It feels so good to give back to this awesome community! A few weeks back I made an entire set of deep pocketed combat armor and modded out guns n ammo to a new player. He kept dying near my camp and sent a message asking for help. I cleared the super mutants and gave him some new courage
---
Well, gonna go farm me a legendary flamer.
---
How come no vats? I normally use vats as sometimes I’m worried about hitting a player by mistake haha
---
Yes I think 2 or 3 UNY AP pieces. I'll double check for you.
---
You clearly weren't around during Halo 3's pre and post game lobbies.
---
Argh! That’s the worst man I feel you. Only happened to me once, but I’m rarely at cap limit since I’m always buying steel and ammo.
---
which is pretty much true, the studio they use as working/had only done mobile games before so that is probably partly why is so mobile-esqu (source - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda\_Game\_Studios\_Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin))
---
Samuel?
---
I know my buddy is disapointed in the selection for his excavator set
---
If you’re a high health build go for it. If you’re low health it’s going to take forever to roll a decent bolstering and unyielding.
---
Diseased Robot giving you a sickness, through PA. My immersion, it hurts...
---
A "Guest Book" type feature would be nice.
---
Even for the bad type of comments, it'd be nice to see what people come up with.
---
Train stations seem to be popular. I have dropped tons of ammo there and regularly find others do as well.
---
You won't see it above your own name because you don't need to form a bond with yourself, it's automatic.
---
Yeah I only use them because I have quite a rigid legendary pricing system in my vending machines so I have to note to self how much I'll sell them for or I'll forget
---
It won’t land most of the time. You will just waste ammo on splash damage.
---
My worst facepalm moments are always when ppl falsely call a weapon legacy xD
---
I am not much of a PVP player. And I usually do not do PVP in games which has PVE modes. Also the glitches makes me uncomfortable to choose this choice.
---
However NW is not bad at all. Its quick, fast enough with action. It has a way more apocalyptic atmosphere then I have imagined before. So playing it for a few rounds to some SCORE is ok.
---
Also NW challenge is still on for the ghillie suit.
---
Equip the scrapper perk when you scrap weapons and armour, that’ll give you a lot of steel
---
That a smart idea, I'll give it a go! Thanks
---
I think they might be working on a bulk transfer  due to high demand.
---
Also, not sure if you know this yet but you can speed up your process if you're doing a lot of 1 ammo type, by pressing your back button after putting a load through. 👍
---
Ra ra should meet Graham
---
Ah cool, thanks. I will remember to not use vats with it.  Thanks again
---
My personal challenge is cannibalizing before they hit the ground.
---
Same with scorched. Cannibalize before they fall to their knees.
---
I say go for it, even if it's a one star reduced weight one. Mine isn't legendary, but I'm kicking myself for the time I scripped a two shot flamer way back before my friend found out about the flamer trick and then passed it on to me.
---
Shut up, Samuel, Jen won't respect a whiner.
---
Is two shot explosive not legacy? My bad I thought it was lol I guess I don’t know what legacy is then. Care to enlighten me?
---
YES! I've been complaining about this bug for a while now, though, in my case, my limit dropped by only 5 - its supposed to be 50 and i think you may have just hit the root cause - vendoring a renamed item.
---
For the record, I've tried removing all renamed items and it has no impact to correct it. I've also tried just about every other act I can think of. It seems like your name limit is permanently stuck unless bethesda fixes it or someone finds a way around it.
---
Probably my consistent forgetting what mods I have on and have taken off, so quite often I'm curing my mutations. 👍
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Might as well take out the Demo Expert Perk....
---
Drop in some agility for CRIT bonus damage instead.
---
Yeah, I know. Although I forget to switch out most of the time.
---
which I hate. after Faschnut, I had so many legendaries, scrip, and Treasury notes, that I couldn't move fast travel unless I was hoped on enough chems, food, and booze to boost my Carry weight by 100 extra. the limits imo hinder the game more than actually making me want to come back the next day to scrap more stuff. This is the reason why I have avoided the purveyor sales as I don't have the carry weight to support multiple shit weapons that I can not turn into scrip. and at this point, I just turn the excess scrip into legendary modules as nothing is worth the excess weight IMO
---
Shoot, I can imagine the hassle with that.
---
Thought the same thing with the nuka tapper saves.
---
People suck. I was in a group with one other dude who helped me defending an attack on a workshop we claimed. Everyone else left, so it was just him, myself, and like five workshops. I was running bloodied build, and obviously he knew. Once we defended it, he left the group, then stealth sniped/murdered me, and continued to send spam shit texts to me as he went workshop to workshop taking them all for himself telling me how I was such a noob player and whatever, and that I should kill myself.
---
It's cool though. I muted his mic, so he texted me all that stuff, so I reported him thru Xbox. Especially the bullshit about telling me I should kill myself. This was on Sunday, was there a free weekend or something? Dude was being an absolute twat.
---
To be honest with you guys I still have no idea how this bounty system works. I often get messages someone around me is getting attacked during SBQ events, sometimes I am shooting SBQ and someone gets in the line of fire, not sure if I am the one "attacking" them or someone else. And a couple of times I've seen a wanted level on a player with a bounty of 5 caps on the map. But I don't know if I get a bounty myself when someone gets in front of me while I am shooting mobs.
---
Switching perk cards is the bane of my existence
---
Ah Ultra at 1080 is overkill, try high or medium which should slash your RAM footprint. Check in task manager how much physical memory FO76 is using and whether once it's running how much if any physical RAM you have free - I'm guessing none. If FO76 has to page memory it gets very messy.
---
What's your CPU exactly? Do you have FoV changed in the settings? High angle FoV needs to render more on screen at one time particularly when turning in areas with lots of stuff. I had these issues with my old 1050ti but they are largely absent since getting a 1660 super.
---
It's def not a broken hardware problem, you would see bluescreens and/or corrupted graphical artifacts if it were.
---
It's somewhere in the double, if not triple digits. 😅
---
Just last night i arrived at a Feral Ghoul horde boss in the mire just as it wandered into a pack of L40 glowing Snallygasters and got its ass handed to him.
---
^(Awesome.)
---
Guess ill just slowboat back to where i was.
---
The scorch beast head is an award from the mole miner treasurer hunter event, and I believe also from the Xmas event(I was on a break so I can’t be 100% in that one) go to a trading sub I’m sure someone will make a trade with you or can build one for you
---
Nice.
---
My Camp consists of basically the Bungalow and a log cabin with some random, easy to place outside stuff like crops, the fire pit, decon shower, a few lights and a cooking station.  I can move in less than 3 minutes.  The bungalow will hold a bed, musical instrument, stash/scrapbox and every workbench/brewing station if you place them carefully.  I have a generator on top and 4 rocket turrets.  It moves as one unit, ready to go.  
---
In the cabin, I have my vending machines and on top if it is another generator and 4 more turrets.  I have room left to place my Ally if I wish.  My camp budget is less than half used, even with a bunch of crops.
---
Not to mention grouping in Public Event Team for double Event Exp to hit that repeatable SCORE
---
The final weapon reward for the Astronaut Ally is the alien blaster, which is how I have it. I only ever heard about there being a separate way to get the blaster, so I'm now curious how to find this ammo.
---
All mounted heads are available except for queen claw. You can get scorchbeasts head from presents.
---
I am central US but stay up late often. I don't think region lag is as much an issue as the servers.
---
*laughs in plague walker*
---
Jeez! Lol, I’m sure you have the recipes? If not, it’d be worth investing at this point if it keeps happening like that
---
150 is a little ridiculous.  You're capped at lvl 50 so why on earth would you need 100 more levels for what?  Repoint SPECIALS if you didn't do it right?     
---
That would block a huge part of the player base who either hasn't been playing this game for years or actually has a job or a family, and for no reason, because you're basically OP in this game by lvl 50.
---
how did you put these icons on the rewards?
---
Very cool note indeed but sonething more cool there is the squating protectrons
---
L14, but i dont really pay any attention to it. These are just the ranks ive gotten while doing my own thing.
---
In my experience, in marine or power armor the Gauss Shotgun is a tickle beam
---
Yeah, I got my blaster from the ally quest, so I'm not familiar with any of this. It sounds like it's more trouble than it's worth in the end, barring the novelty of going pew pew pew.
---
I just found out the Ultracite Emergency Protocols plans are highly sought after. Ive sold a lot of Ultracite plans before and I may have sold one for like 200 caps.
---
That would be the smart option, but boy am I not smart. 😂
---
I’ve found that this community is the best one I’ve been apart of, I’ve learnt a lot about the game and people on here have helped me in game and I’m glad this guide helped you
---
You're totally right. I suspect the other perk (can't remember the name) that refills the AP bar after killing something in VATS is also broken
---
Explosive Flamers, Exploding Lasers/Plasma, Dragons off the top of my head.
---
Basic TSEs are nerfed but not legacy.
---
When ATHENA visited my CAMP the 2 or three times after finishing the Commander's quest line, there were no incidents with ATHENA AGGRO on my CAMP. 
---
HOWEVER, after returning from an unrelated quest - Mining Suit Registration - I come back to ATHENA attacking a turret on my CAMP site. I finally ended up logging off to stop this 'unprovoked' attack - because ATHENA would not stop attacking. 
---
ATHENA is not the only Trader that has been ATTACKED by my CAMP. YES. My CAMP Turret first attacked the guy trader and GRAHAM the mutant trader. The difference is I let GRAHAM destroy the turret that attacked him FIRST and all was fine after that. The 'guy' Trader didn't care about the turret shooting at him and then the turret stopped for reasons unknown. No problem with him. But ATHENA just kept attacking and destroying CAMP items; as if one turret was not enough. She destroyed a turret, the table it was on, 2 walls, and then I logged out.
---
AND I will be filing a bug report with BETHESDA about this issue.
---
Ahhh, I see. I saw in a post all tse is legacy. Well I don’t feel as bad then because I used that hunting rifle for a bit and it honestly sucked lmao. Thanks for the info👍
---
She's got style I can respect, you know what I mean?
---
I hope the new repeatable is to eat 20 pre war food lol, I have 10k halloween candy.
---
1. Every grind they add is just a glorified chore. There is no diversity to grinds and if you want to get any of the season pass done, or bullion, you need to play a certain way instead of how you want to.
---
2. No endgame content. There are several unopened vaults. Some of which are apparently pretty much finished but they haven't added them. There needs to be repeatable raids that are difficult for gameplay reasons, not because we are fighting against server issues and lag.
---
3. Camp budget is way too long for the amount of stuff they add. I understand server issues etc but look at games like ARK and Rust. They have very high pop servers, massive bases and server stability is fine.
---
Special mention: Constant limitations on everything. 
---
Scrip, bullion, caps. We can only earn so much every day, not only that but there is also a cap that prevents us from saving indefinitely. Therefore removing any reason to grind when you've capped all those things.
---
Mini nukes aren't valid? Good to know, I just thought I didn't have enough to trade in. Those stinkers are heavy.
---
Daily caps have been here since day 1 my friend, you haven’t missed anything good lol
---
There is an unmarked mini-quest to find the ammo and the plan to mod the gun for regular energy cells. 
---
You actually get the normal alien blaster no problem right at the start- you just can't shoot it 
---
Would you like to know how to start the treasure hunt?
---
What platform are you on? I def have mirelurk claw and scorch beast, as well as SBQ heads. Pretty sure I got them from a pile of presents someone dropped for me during fasnacht.
---
Yeah I think that’s why I was confused because the quest says materials and the actual item is waste so I thought I had to break it down 🤦🏼‍♀️
---
Upvoted for "Fun Police".
---
Can confirm!  I just pulled 1225 Lead Scrap by doing this run.  Thanks!!
---
6 fucking weight each. Bloody joke
---
Are you on XBox? If so, I'd pay you 500 caps for it.
---
My husband and I go to this event every time we see it pop up. I see most people standing in one spot while we run around like chickens with our heads cut off to find sludge/kelp/venison. The last one we did we needed 5 whatever to get level three and the guy just sat on top of something and one shot legendaries instead of helping.
---
Usually when a bunch of people show up they are just trying to kill legendaries and nothing else. It gets really frustrating!
---
This is how Radiation Rumble has gotten so bad. We had one finish 95/100 because no one else helped us, even though there were 10 people there! They all just stood at the chokes and tried to kill everything before everyone else.
---
I'm not sure if people just don't understand or don't care but it's frustrating to see events fail or not fully suceed with so many people there.
---
I picked up 1000 rounds of 10mm in a train  station when my character was low level. It was like winning the lottery. I've been dumping random stuff in suitcases since.
---
Also there are a few more "clever" ways to limit how much caps a person can or is willing to have ...
---
[How much does a bottlecap weigh?](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-a-single-metal-bottle-cap-weigh-from-a-beer-or-soda-bottle)
---
2,18g per cap, or 0,0048lb ... 10k bottlecaps would pretty much weigh 50lb :) Add a 90% reduction from perks and you still have your soft-cap, without it feeling so forced.
---
Vendors should replenish caps from trade and daily (in-game day, not real world day). A vendor would then still have limited caps, but when a day in-game (about 72 minutes real time) passes, it would at least add up to some, be it random, amount.
---
Then If I go to enclave, spend 27k on a recipe, i should be able to sell them stuff for 27k to get it right back (or atleast 70% of it) :D Where else do the caps go then?
---
Don't start Encryptid with the expectation someone else is going to tank the pylons for you.
---
How much? Gotta get one for my follower also im on ps4
---
No problem, glad it helped you
---
Haha, that would be cool! I have something like 700, but still
---
Damnnn...that’s another facepalm for me too bro lmao I regularly sell all my plans for 25c unless I know it’s rare or in demand...and I did not know that about the protocols. Shoot, I’ve probably sold quite a few at 25c as I seem to get ultracite plans all the time
---
I've actually heard of this in passing when I looked up the variant of the blaster I got. Thanks, but given how convoluted it all sounds, I'll just shelve the idea until later  when I can look up a walk through.
---
Scavenger hunts are fun. Scavenger hunts that have me wander aimlessly for 5 hours are not. (Not saying this is the latter, but...you get the idea.)
---
PC. I already have SBQ, just need Scorchbeast and both claws.
---
&gt;No one who is at a high level is really struggling to survive
---
unless you get stuck in a 3-way gangbang between groups of Mirelurk kings, LVL 52 Colonel Gutsys, and Yao Guai.
---
Talk about a stun lock, Anti Armor, death in seconds hell.
---
but I do agree that armor and weapon level caps should be increased passed 50 just to get rid of all of the duped and hacked weapons.
---
as for the NCR bundle. I would love it and hate to see it at the same time. Love it because HELL YEAH NCR, but hate it as the vault dwellers from vault 15 that would turn into the NCR, Khans, Vipers, and more would have just left the vault in 2097. the NCR wouldnt be a thing until 2186. so unless the game progresses 83 years, the NCR wouldnt be a thing
---
Definitely a weapon you use either sparingly or with the relevant ordinance perk.
---
Ah good to know, I missed that tid bit of info. If it came from a pail, that's probably going to be pretty pricey I bet, huh?
---
Its from the Lunchbox.
---
It gives you and everyone around you that 25% xp bonus (which is stackable up to 100%) and a random effect like enemys explode with confetti or less hunger or thirst
---
yep same with my 800 lb stash, permanently moving items in and out of my vendors lol, its like a mini game of shop titans -.- lol
---
With the right build, a Gauss shotgun can totally obliterate anything.
---
Luckily people usually let go of them pretty cheap. I’ve consistently being seeing serums for 250 a pop with the exception of marsupial and adrenal reaction those are always pricey
---
Thanks for the info.
---
herbivore is a lot more easy to sustain to be honest
---
Is it youse, yinze, y'all? I just can't keep up!
---
Terrible Tip:  you can use nukashine to move around the map when you are overencumbered.
---
i do this when i'm so overencumbered i have to slow-walk.   usually within a bottle or two i end up nearish a vendor or scrap table.
---
i did say terrible tip ;)
---
Imagine fucking caring. MW2 lobbies back in the day were 10 times worse than this just block and move on.
---
Imagine being so callous that you'd have a problem with their objection to abhorrent behavior.
---
Was when i gave my friend a legendry laser gatling and a set of armor(regen,self revive,chameleon...) since he was a level away from using them. so i took him to go do a mission since he needed just a little exp and on the way he must have stopped at the vendor to sell it all because he couldnt use it, which i didnt relize until after he levelled up and i asked him how the gear was helping. this was before they added the purveyor so he only got minimal caps from it all.
---
If you ever find 15k .38 in a trashcan at the Sutton train station, you can probably find me on the map.
---
inventory sorting needs a general rework. keys should be on a ring, id cards should be in a wallet or something, but neither should be loose in 'MISC.' these things and quest items should all fall under their own header.
---
also, apparel. armor and outfits should each have their own section. it doesn't make sense that i have to sift through every one of my outfits to make sure i don't miss any armor to scrap or scrip, or even just to put my pieces back on. to that same effect, we should also have outfit loadouts/presets. let us save our outfit as a unit so that when i put on stealth armor or a hazmat suit, i can just select the loadout and be on my merry way, rather than spending 5 minutes going through everything and making sure i picked the correct pieces and that i remembered to put on my jumpsuit or outfit.
---
That is the only way to play 😆
---
You do realize theres no almost no way theyll be able to find you right? Its merely an empty threat. Just keep fucking with them
---
As I said, I did not have such an expectation. I didn't even have an expectation to finish it! I had a card and did it. No strings attached. What ticked me off is that other people joining for free, have the expectation from me to tank the (all) the pylons and griefed me for not doing it.
---
Man, I was afraid they'd patch the holiday rewards, but I was hoping they'd skip it for now! I'm really hoping they don't! I was excited to get the chance to get them since I missed my first chance being too chicken to try NW.
---
I emptied a full clip last night with my Junkies Gauss shotgun at point blank range with 95% chance to hit. Eight shots.
---
It takes maybe 20 min if you know what you are doing. Look up the directions if you don't mind 'cheating" 
---
Unlike the XO1 Quantum paint, it all takes place in low level areas relatively close together 
---
And the alien ammo can be server hopped in order to stack up a bunch. Still not a great (or even good) gun. But it is fun to play around with
---
Yeah this week alone I've spent about 4k on getting just marsupial back. (They were roughly 500 each time and for whatever reason it always seems to be marsupial that gets wiped). It's nice to find the people that sell it really cheap like that. 😁
---
Not sure about that. Everyday I've logged on I have XP rolled over from the day before. If I have something like 4685XP out of 10K when I log off It's still there the next day when I log on in the afternoon.
---
Weapons having extra condition from loot is also impacted by your luck level
---
I can help if you have xbox.
---
&gt; have the expectation from me to tank the (all) the pylons and griefed me for not doing it.
---
Yeah, the expectation is that the one starting the event will tank some pylons, or have someone on their team that will.
---
Like I said, don't start the event with the expectation someone else will tank for you.
---
Forget requis we’ve got a new rant
---
Kinetic dynamo no longer works as of WL, tested this many times, and doesn’t get enough recognition 
---
breaks my high health PA build with dodgy :(
---
Oof! Total noob move, but it happens. That sucks. Probably more for you since he didn’t even know what he had lol
---
Oh i have 2 scorchbeast heads and the SBQ head, i might have theclaw but ill check later
---
Not sure of the value, I got skunked during the Pail event, but ended trading a gun for every plan, I do know that some plans are now showing up in player vendors (gorilla plans) and I think I saw a sb plan out there for 5k but I do see the sb mount pop up in the trade subs once and awhile still
---
&gt;clearly i touched a nerve, and youre insecure about the amount of money youre about to dump on this garbage, and thats just life, there are chumps in every circle.
---
I love this backwards line of reasoning.  Sure thing, chief; I'm "triggered" or something because of your nonsensical logic.  Whatever you say.
---
My Character is bugged then because when I apply the Chemist Card it doubles my yield on all smelting
---
i have a stupid amount of alpha/beta keycards from battle bot. I hit it every time i passed during the treasure hunter event bc it's so simple, but i didn't know they didn't remove the cards at the end and that i didn't have to pick them up every time, I could just reuse them.
---
nope... takes to bloody long / too many loading screens to get into a game. its just to frustrating
---
Where did you get the idea that we will ever visit the Capitol Wasteland in this game?
---
Games like F76 change a lot. After the great (TSE) nerfing people were confused that their new god roll weapons weren't great, but google told them it was the best. So asking on here gave them the latest news while google told them what the most (idk how the algorithms work) popular answer is, or rather was yesterday.
---
found out about this about several dozen runs too late.
---
its supposed to be between you two, forms a bond, get it?
---
Along with ultracite...
---
Batteries included and power user are almost mandatory perks for PA, adn address one of your negatives.
---
Power user reduces core consumption.  For me, when I was in Pa full time, a 50% core could last 6+ hours of playtime.
---
or be his grandpa or grandma
---
Well Rested + Canned Meat Stew + Lunchbox + Public Event Group + Inspirational + SBQ Event = Crazy XP
---
Despite being level 160, according to my trophies I have yet to leave Vault 76, so I guess I have a way to go to beat the game.
---
Your not wrong. Plenty of great games are coming out in the next year or so. If Cyberpunk 2077 stands to have an online multiplayer and its done well enough. I see a lot of players jumping ship. Bethesda can only dangle rewards behind huge grinds for so long before people walk away.
---
Dang I'm on XB1. Sorry
---
My cpu is , Intel Core i5-9400F. I haven’t Changed any FOV settings. I recently got a PC so I haven’t really had a issue with FOV since switching from console gaming. 
---
I lowered Texture quality to high and checked task manager. My CPU is at 66% , GPU at 99% , and my memory is at 86%. My gpu seems rather high for only having the game on medium settings.
---
Fasnacht started right after i started playing, i remember dropping every single mask i got because i hate the look of them, had no idea how valuable they were or would become, i remember getting multiple raven and old man winter masks, i try not to think about it lol
---
Thanks, I thougt it was my bond to the team that was broken.
---
I haven’t seen any at SBQ but I have noticed more Flatwoods monsters spawning in the world. I think I’ve seen more in the last week than the other 700+ hours of playtime
---
Mine usually reset once the timer does.
---
Hold onto them until you see things that you genuinely like and get those. I've not spent any irl money on atoms but I find that through playing I have had plenty for the things that I wanted. Granted I play more than a casual player but there was a lot of opportunity to get them, at least until The Legendary Run came out, not sure how it'll go now but it should be okay.
---
It's usual design on MMO games (and MMO-lites like 76). First, it prevent people from burning themselves out on grinding 20hrs/day and them after a week complaining that there's nothing else to do. 
---
Also, it keeps players engaged with the game for a longer period of time. One would say that this is only benefit for the company. It surely is, there's no denying that. But it is also the benefit for newer players who will keep seeing the veteran players around and will give them the idea that the game is alive and well.
---
That's the objective nature of things. Subjectively, the caps are too low. The caps should prevent excessive hoarding of currencies by inhumane grinding. Current caps can be reached very easily. After doing some random things I have enough meat to cook and enough material for chems that combined with looted weapons I can reach 1400 caps easily. 150 scrip? If I'm lucky and get some 3\* drops, it's gone as well. And originally I thought that 200 gold is a reasonable cap. But now when everyone is doing public events in Public Groups, I have more gold tickets than I'm able to redeem. 
---
5000 caps, 500 scrip and 500 gold sounds more reasonable to me.
---
Oh, they won't comment on this. If it's not patch day, they only comment on "idea" posts. Like when someone makes a post saying it would be a neat idea if we had a keyring.
---
Atom Shop usually updates at noon EST. So a little off two hours from now.
---
The rewards it offers aren't that great, even the rare ones. So there's little incentive to actually complete the event for a lot of players. 
---
Combine that with the rest of the players not knowing how to do the event properly and the result is an event that is basically skipped over by everyone.
---
The general playerbase isn’t on this subreddit and I bet they don’t understand the reward structure. Best bet is to have those that can solo the habitats go to the other empty habitats and work them.
---
The NPC vendors usually reset 24 hours after you cap them out or when you drain them of some caps. Same thing as the Legendary exchange. If you’re talking about the legendary run then I think in about 2 hours from now the new weekly challenges and new legendary run prizes should reset.
---
I saw one on the ground in the Cranberry Bog. Daddy needed cloth.
---
Sure, but in NW I don't see how it could be anywhere near as good as a rifle build considering it's perks lack any armor penetration
---
Even with the shotgun damage and explosive damage perks it's taken me two to three times longer to down someone with the gauss shotgun than it would have taken with a rifle 
---
Plus the sound, visuals, and the effective range of the weapon make you a huge target as opposed to pretty much any other weapon 
---
It's flashy but it's really not that great, I would even say combat shotgun is much stronger due to its fire rate, reload speed, and larger clip size 
---
In NW I mean, in the normal game the Gauss Shotgun is definately a monster to be feared and respected
---
Fools? I don't log off at all in the daily rest. Never had a problem. ranked at 23 atm. Thanks for the "theory" though.
---
The confetti is great.  Noticed I had a ton of bonus effects going from everyone opening boxes at scorched earth including 100% xp.  Only one I really cared about was the damn confetti though.
---
If it's something I would never be able able to figure out on my own, I would absolutely "cheat" in order to do it (as far as I'm concerned, this was a "community puzzle").
---
Simple as this really, when you die you drop your junk. It's a feature OP. You should get into the habit of scrapping it every time you get back to camp and not traveling and doing events with a lot in your inventory.
---
I’m talking in NW. Marine armor. Handmade. Drugged up with Psycho. I was one tapped by a Gauss shotgun.
---
Good info.  Thanks
---
That being said shoot a mole rat with a mini nuke and be confused u only did 1 damage but killed it
---
I'm from Nebraska so I just hear "you guys"
---
😂
---
I'm on Xbox unfortunately. They do not really move in my vendor.
---
But it's expected that people will kill you if you have a bounty, I know you didn't mean it but at the end of the day it puts a big target on you. In fact it's better to immediately store all of your junk and find someone to kill you - if you don't, you could be killed at any moment and lose progress/junk. 
---
If they continued harassing you after they got the bounty then it's different and they were griefers. It is kinda dick move for high level players to take low level player junk though. If someone dies at an event I usually sit on their junk so no one can steal it.
---
Dang. Whats their price?
---
You’re not a flake 🤣
---
I'll just put that here – what am I supposed to do at the "It's a trap" event? I did it once again yesterday. Activated the bait. Every 90 seconds or so 5 Ghouls spawned. Killed them. Waited for the next "wave". Repeat. 10 minute timer over – "event failed".
---
Was I supposed to not kill those?
---
Oh it's totally easy than 
---
Just look it up on youtube 
---
You'll spend more time in a half dozen load screens than you will actually playing to get it
---
Well at the very least it'd be nice if someone could at least look at it.
---
Yeah, i agree. A new player should follow the initial story and explore the current areas. 
---
Why a new player should spawn in an expansion area? That doesn't make any sense. If someone want to start the game shoud finish the first story line and when he reach above 50 lvl then he should be able to proceed to the next map. If someone rush the whole process and go to the expansion map immediately then what's the point ? You will have just missed a huge map (Appalachia) with events and quests. 
---
The expansion maps should be for the high levels only (50+) and only if you have finished the story line. An expansion should provide new challenges for the existing player base, new area to explore, new items to get, a new story line to follow. If this area is a lvl 1 area then it would be pretty boring to explore without real threat. 
---
Personally,  whenever i start a new game i want some goals and content. Sometimes it's good to have a restricted content because it makes you want it more. If you are level 1 and you join a group for the scortchbeast queen then you have seen one end game boss, what's the point to rush the whole process and see from your first minutes of your game play everything? 
---
Some things are pretty obvious i think.
---
Agreed, though of course they screwed up the balance here and made it one of the worst weapons in the game. Just add it to the ever growing list, I guess.
---
I have 57 Tech Documents I got from a random player......so......I have to drop or sell them now?
---
We had an intrusion module. 
---
 HAD! It's gone now.... stolen.
---
I love how I'll be in PA and a Molerat or Ghoul just looks in my direction and I'll get diseased. But if I stand under the SB Queen's Ass I won't get the Whoopsies.
---
I know that, no offence but I'm gonna trust the wiki and i used an energy bobblehead (energy gun damage 20%) and it didn't effect the gauss shotgun.
---
Ignoring the named locations, the VA state line should be about an inch to the left, including some of the mountains. If you look at a topo map of VA you'll see the state is mountains on the west and then a coastain plain area. It looks like the cranberry bog is supposed to represent the coastal plains of VA. 
---
This also means that the entire map of Fallout 3 sits directly east of Valley Galleria, literally just a stone throw away.
---
Had a guy pestering me on a new character for almost an hour while I was running through the main quest once. I couldn't have been more than level 5, while he was level 16 or so. He just would not stop shooting me as I went about my business. Originally I ignored him, but it got annoying after awhile so I just lined up my pipe revolver with his skull and readied a throwing knife, shoot, throw, shoot, dead. Looted his stuff for being a jackass and went back to doing my thing. He came back, but apparently he was only good at hitting targets that don't fight back because I did the same thing. This repeated about 3 more times before I decided that, as much as I enjoy the caps, I didn't need to waste time with this dude and swapped servers.
---
is NW level balanced or is it your adventure level? do you spawn in with gear or have to scavenge guns? new player curious of the mode with no real intention to play it regularly
---
I think he posted this because there was a different repeatable for the seasons that was datamined. So some speculate the XP one won’t be there every week.
---
It’s a event were bloodied builds are useless for tanking the pylons which people probably get frustrated by because they are required to do the task and not get rewarded for it if they don’t also get a hit on the boss. (I get the fact you can do “lots of damage” however if no one uses the pylons it doesn’t matter) 
---
since at least 50% of the playerbase seems to be on a bloodied build I can understand their frustration, honestly they need to make some more viable builds.
---
I’ve only recently come back to the game and I see the appeal and have already started working towards my bloodied build having all your special stats that high is insane. I’m really looking forward to Loadouts, it will allow people to change it up and not be so limited.
---
No, each member's blue bar represents their bond with you. And you're welcome, glad to help.
---
Without, but it's truly endgame once I get it, it's just such a rare drop man /s
---
Well you will eventually run out and then the desperation sets in.
---
I only have one.  Event spawns seem to have gotten worse.  I’ll spend ten mins in an events group without a single event popping up.
---
I sell most plans at 20 caps and it let's most low levels buy them without high levels stealing
---
I truly cannot believe people come to reddit to tattle when someone did something to offend them in game. This is the best time to be alive - we did it, reddit!
---
you're not spending atoms on mostly cosmetic items to spend atoms on mostly cosmetic items
---
Yeah, in a game that's so heavy on inventory management and tedious loadout swaps, there's 3 second freeze to open favorites and swap weapons, 5 second freeze to get into the gods-forsaken cards menu, 3 second freeze to open the map, endless lag in any inventory or vendor menu. Starting since this last update, the Aid tab in pipboy causes the game to freeze for 10-15 seconds every time I tab over to it. Trying to reload weapons during scorched earth and accidentally opening the inventory of a corpse has resulted in crashes a non-zero number of times.
---
I drop everything I don't need like notes/holotapes etc and my Aid inventory isn't even bloated. A vast majority of my weight capacity is just taken up by scrap. Game's just broke as hell. Meanwhile they charge people out the ass for that scrap box just so they don't have to play Inventory Manager for most of their playtime. I assume it's better on PC but Xbox one x performance is appalling. I'm a serious masochist or addict for still trying to play this turd but I still do it.
---
Does it really matter where people spend atoms? Either the shop or to progress in seasons?
---
One hell of a grind, though, and the outcast paint is your only real choice there if you’re not a fan of gaudy repaints/skins.
---
All the way up top in boss room. Next to keys.
---
I just started using blocker over the weekend because I rearranged my cards to try something new. I feel like I can say it’s working. I was taking hardly any damage from ghouls once I put it on.
---
Ya, it is SO unfair that you have to put in daily effort to earn something! So mean of Bethesda to be like this! They should just give it all away for free so there would be no reason to even play/login, you are way ahead of Beth in this one!
---
I absolutely refuse to drop my reading and listening material. Especially since it makes up what is essentially a tiny amount of my inventory. 
---
And I'm with you there. The longer I play the more I feel like an experiment in how much futility I'm willing to put up with
---
Do you usually sneak or stand when in combat?
---
Do you not run armorclad and/or lifegiver perk? 
---
Even without those tho, I don't understand how that could have happened
---
I'm not saying you're lying I'm just honestly confused because I've been blasted point blank plenty of times and it's only taken me down to a little over half health if I had scout armor on or higher :/
---
Likewise I feel like it takes me an awkward amount of shots to down anybody with it, and that's even when making sure I'm charging the blast to 100 every time, which is another detriment to its already slow fire rate 
---
I've never seen it oneshot anything tbh :/
---
Wonder what the difference in our perspectives is? Maybe we just keep running into people with very different perks or something haha idk
---
Once you have the ammo convertor, which sucks anyway, nothing much else worth getting except skins... :-)
---
CPU is more than adequate. In that memory field - I'm guessing you're on Windows 10 (I'm on 7) how much physical memory is being used? In Win 7 it's at the bottom of the task manager http://prntscr.com/tdg2vy - I am guessing that you are forcing Windows to page some of the game's memory as I am using 6GB already with Windows and a couple of browsers.
---
I’m so not creative at all and I wish you could buy pre built camps that only needed you to place minor items.
---
Highest exp I got from sbq event so far was 4K. That’s without lunchbox. It’s crazy.
---
It’s not a case of not realising, I think, but rather more than one habitat often being unmanageable (unless you have a huge group) due to the number of enemies the event dumps in your lap.
---
&gt;No other BP is like this. 
---
Idk about you but Apex Legends' recent battle pass system isnt designed like Fallout 76.
---
You have to purchase the pass and each season last about 3 months. After you completely leveled up the pass you can have enough credits to buy the next season!
---
There are daily and weekly challenges.
---
Dailies consist of 4 easy as heck challenges. So easy that its literally just "Kill 6 enemies", "Play 2 games as X character", "Deal 350 damage ( a fully amored person is 200hp)". **Basically playing the games normally**. These give out battle pass points. These can take around 30mins at best or 2 hours at worst to complete.
---
Weeklies unlock each week but the previous weeks actually stay so if you miss a week its okay, you can do them along with the other weeklies. They consist of challenges that rewards a whole battle pass level and battle pass points. There harder imo only 20% are hard as heck, the 80% easily doable.
---
Ive only payed for season 1. And now im at season 5 and havent spend any more money.
---
Are we just going to not talk about how great the misc note section on your pip boy was in fo3 and nv?
---
I honestly dont understand the change, I play hundreds of hours on these damn games and I can't think of one time I've had to "physically" drop a note or piece of paper for a quest and/or game mechanic lol vanilla or modded
---
I was making a joke, instead of getting ultracite paint we would get more for the T-45 and excavator power armors
---
Both. If I’m at range I sneak but up close I stand usually for the slightly faster movement speed. When I sneak though nothing really notices me even up close because of how much agility I have and my sneak armor.
---
Firaxis's XCOM games actually do nudge it in your favor at times. Quite a few under the hood things exist to give the player a tiny boost. XCOM 2 for example on Commander and below has a hidden consecutive bonus to hit on misses, and will steer pods away from you if you have above 6 enemies at once. And on Veteran and lower enemies gets an accuracy malus on successive hits and you get a hidden hit bonus when your squad is under 4.
---
Mirelurk claw was duped to hell &amp; back. I think I found a few dozen plans of it - the rest I dumped into Fissure Site Prime.
---
The SBQ &amp; SB mounted heads are also awarded by killing the Queen (but after you learn them, they won't drop again).
---
Oooh wait now I get it lol
---
You forgot about Mama Dolces many spare cards in your inventory lol.
---
SOMETIMES I catch on see the weather, and I'm all "fuck fuck fuck! Hazmat now!!! Open pip-boy, DAMMIT MAN!!!" but last time that happened was before wastelanders
---
Oh ya will you pvp me too if I don't? Or will you block me to show me how superior you are for helping new players. This entire post is 100 percent pure bb boi neckbeard. 
---
I am sure you've never won anything competitive in your life.
---
I managed to 100 caps for one a while back, but they have been sitting at 50 for a little while now. My buddy dropped his to 25 and they still sit.
---
I'm pretty sure I got the western outfit with chaps when I was about level 15 and then sold it to an NPC vendor for a few caps having no idea what it was, assuming that I could just buy another like any of the normal clothes you could just buy in the earlier games. 
---
I'm sure there are others as well, I sell most of my plans for 25 or 100 caps depending on what they are, including all the power armor stuff. I know the ultracite emergency protocols and calibrated shocks are rare, but not what most of the others are actually worth.
---
I run Lifegiver. Never thought Ironclad was useful enough to justify changing my main game build for it. Although after getting a kill on one squaddie, the damage I do on the others is ludicrous. After wiping out a squad and chugging two Stimpaks, by the time I loot more ammo from the corpses, two or three more teams of 2-4 arrive and I can mow them down too because of adrenaline. Adrenaline + psycho = one shot on literally anybody, PA or no. That’s a hell of a combo.
---
Yup. I stack as much as I can, then when she's down I go and trigger Encryptid. Between the Event XP and kills, I usually get the repeatable SCORE XP from these two alone.
---
I feel sad that I didn’t think of this... well done
---
Let the battle for Mama Dolce's begin.
---
I've been killed in PVP twice. Once when I was lvl 14 and the other dude was lvl 146. He was trying to initiate and I wouldn't engage. He waited for me to get attacked by mobs, then ran in front of my shots. He turned around and one shot me. That must have been fun for him. 
---
The second time was the other day. I had claimed the food factory and was messing around in the area. I got the message to defend the workshop. I really only claimed it because I hadn't before, so I almost let it go. I fast travel expecting mobs, but I got 1 shot killed by an invisible player. I just laughed because it was completely unexpected. 
---
I have had 99% positive interactions with FO76 players. It's too bad some people have to take it so seriously they feel the need to harass other players even though they're the ones instigating.
---
I think its capped at 4k. Or so I read somewhere.
---
Ouch.
---
Didn't 3 or 4 have a keyring in vanilla? It's not even so much what modders have done as much as it is "Bethesda you've done this before we know you know how to code it"
---
I don't think so.  I run at about 70 weight out of 220, even naked I'm not encumbered.  Every single time I die I can't respawn unless it's a loadscreen away.  Can't spawn anywhere near the place I died or it just loops over and over and never respawns.  You can be killed but can't move and if you die again it lets you respawn.  It did this on a brand new character with nothing in the inventory also.  It's 100% of the time for me and it's really awful.
---
I heard angry turtle imply that blocker is for when you are not sneaking. Not sure if the perk was intended that way, the card doesn't say that.  In the past, it has always seemed to work for me no matter if I am sneaking or not.  Lately though, I notice that I am getting clobbered by hits that I would have just shrugged off before the patch.
---
FFS! First NPC vendor i went to had them. if you're on xbox you can have them.
---
So really I should dump it and look for a quad or FFR or a TS because the zealots prefix only boosts the damage (which is pathetic,) and not the rate of freeze.
---
Aye true enough, I don't recall to be honest as I always played with mods so I can never recall what was in any of the vanilla games.
---
I would recommend buying the gravestone marker. Unfortunately, you don't get a death blip if you die in an instance, and the height difference between the gravestone and paper bag can make finding your loot easier.
---
Another unfortunate is that you can't favorite power armor. I'll admit that I've accidentally scrapped power armor. Power armor skins add a little icon next to the power armor, which can help you identify them when you're scrapping. But then again, you can rename them in all caps to make them stand out.
---
Let's be honest here, optimizing that wouldn't do much since it's only an integer which most likely isn't even a byte big.
---
never had a problem with him and I think this "Monday" talk has been changed has it not? He always says to "come back next week" sense the change and its been weeks I think so I don't understand why the post now about this.
---
Well up until this weekend if I got caught by a ghouls mob I would be killed in seconds from their melee attacks. With blocker I can stand in the middle of a mob now and my health bar only moves tiny amounts and I can kill them all before I even need to stimpak
---
Funnily enough, based on the text on the serum for the mutation, I think it’s slightly broken - it claims that diseases are supposed to never wear off, yet my friend who has it says they still do.
---
What a bitch. Hope he gets banned. The 76 community don’t need that crazy.
---
Never seen that before. I usually don't even bother with power armor. I've always been able to grab more than one.
---
Oh no, are you serious?
---
I can't be playing this battle royale everyday, I thought that "well I hope there's enough time to get all ranks even without playing NW"
---
Oh cool I havent bothered with adrenaline since I just assumed it wasn't working since it's still broke in the main game, thanks for the tip!
---
The seedy shed is the cheap mans version of fo1st tent...sold for 500 atoms 😂
---
I bought it in a heartbeat
---
There's actually a location in the game the not too many people know about it seems that has a shed/house packed full of prewar food and drinks.
---
I would also like to throw out that they could give us holotape holders, that are specific to the type of holotapes (Overseer's, etc). Then they can be used as displays like the bobbleheads.
---
I mean it was mentioned in the patch notes..
---
My lvl 17 alt bought it at Charleston station 2 days ago. I may have seen it early on with my lvl 131 main, but I know I haven't seen it in at least 6 months (I could have missed it, but I usually buy any plans I don't know for my main because there aren't many left she doesn't know)
---
I haven’t played NW since Patch 20 though. I’ve been too disgusted with the state of the main game. Only twenty minutes ago, I found a piece of my Strangler Heart Power Armor on my magazine rack. This has led to me scrapping all my vendors immediately. I am *not* losing another legacy.
---
[They're already said they're going to fix/change how the ammo converter works.](https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1278728339780485120)
---
Yeah, the Imposter outfit and helmet and the mascot outfit and helmet sell quickly \~500 caps but they are much harder to get. The fedora drops like 90% of the time.
---
Toxic players exist, block and mute  or go to a different server.
---
I have doubts about it being "common".
---
"Alternative currencis" maybe, in FO76 meaning scrip and bullion - in other games I experienced that would be like arena points in WoW, or there used to be tokens you could buy one-tier-lower armors for, getting them from heroic dungeons ... 
---
Main currency? Rarely, if ever ...  
---
Off the top of my head - Elite:Dangerous, EVE, WoW, ESO, Path of Exile, GTA V, RDO, RIFT, Lineage 2, even that old korean or chinese? P2W POS MU Online ... I don't think any of them have any hard cap on how much money you can make in a day, let alone have.
---
Path of Exile, the one true F2P game on the list ... you can grind it endlessly. And you have as "big" of a chance of getting the top tier currency from your first kill as you have never seeing it in person your whole life...
---
"Endgame" is always a grind. But I don't feel (bottle)caps should be the real endgame here. Altough - what exactly is endgame here?
---
Oof
---
Xb1
---
That's hilarious lmao
---
I would love a power armor magazine rack in my base tbh
---
That makes sense as I got exactly 4000 exp. I was thinking that may have been case.
---
There's a reason why Survival mode got shut down while cooperative gameplay and clever CAMP building became the shining highlights of 76. Too many people just can't handle getting their vibe checked when they're absorbed in cheaply pwning noobs.
---
I think it would be good to have an item you can build in your CAMP that you could dump all your notes, holos and keys in. Some kind of dresser, desk or something.
---
I'm not sure what your seeing buy I tested it using a stopwatch and at 165 AP it takes 18~ secknds to fully replenish my AP without Action Boy but with Action Boy it takes 12~ seconds so Action Boy is definitely working for me. 
---
Not I don't have any buffs or equipment increasing my AP or AP refresh rate.
---
Good info, why do you recommend crystal barrel? Is it just for the range or does it freeze faster?
---
Omg I've been saying this since launch there are all kinds of little things like this at would make pa worth it again
---
You have a full helm with breathing tubes pa should be able to breath underwater ( you sink to the bottom in pa so seems like a no brainer)
---
Extra disease resistants ( your in a one man tank for God sakes) 
---
And this is coming from a guy that never even uses PA
---
Is it not a thing already? Oops.
---
The guy being spanked, excuse me what?
---
If you are running AP refresh legendary pieces it's possible action boy was never adding any benefit for you before. I've seen a ton of posts researching the AP refresh rates and it was all inconclusive as hell so I have no idea what works. 
---
All I know for sure was that there are points of diminishing return between different AP refresh such as food buffs, legendary armor, action boy and lone wanderer. Take off any other AP refresh stuff and then test action boy by itself to confirm. Recent patches may have changed how the different sources apply for stacking.
---
People still do PVP in 76? I may have to come back then, that was the only thing I enjoyed - making manchildren rage
---
Fallout VR done right would be amazing. Fallout 4 VR imo is not done right. especially after experienced Half-Life Alyx.
---
I agree. I think Bethesda hoped people would buy atoms for their cosmetics, and some people will, but no more than people used to. 
---
There was always more in the atom shop than you could buy with free atoms, so most people just decided to skip stuff they couldn't afford. Now we have less atoms so we will skip stuff more. Less people will have the latest cosmetics, which may increase their perceived value for some people, and may turn others away from an atom store they get little or nothing from.
---
My biggest worry is that casual players give up on trying to get the end of season rewards (it takes a serious commitment), so they won't get many atoms or many of the season rewards.
---
It would have been cool if they would have made a global leader board for the holotape games
---
Report that type of action
---
You have to place a fallout 1st tent in a certain position next to the power line pole.
---
Do not underestimate the desire of people to pay for access to the chicken coop.
---
My total memory usage appears to be 81%. It also shows me the total MB used for fallout 76 and that’s 2,373MB.
---
the limits do not successfully do this, therefore, they should be removed and replaced with something that does...
---
&gt; Shot a ghoul standing on the other side of the room "You contracted Rad Worms". How? Did they somehow float over, nibble on my steel plated shins to create a tiny hole and slip in that way? 
---
He probably coughed on you from there xD
---
But in all seriousness, I do agree with you. Funny how we can take multiple hits from the SBQ but noooooooo a fucking cricket is able to give us a disease and give us enough damage to end our career right there and then.
---
I hope so.
---
More stuff for me to buy. I want to spend atoms on the game I love, but there simply isn't enough appealing stuff in the store.
---
If I have anything left over from my 15,000 atoms when I buy my way to the end of the game board, I will gladly buy lunchboxes.
---
they already do this though, nobody trades top tier equipment in vendors.
---
Even if they did what effect do you think they will have?
---
Because those kits had zero impact on the game even though they were touted to be pay to win.
---
You can mix it up all you want. The excavator and Strangler Heart are the only ones with any type of set bonus.
---
If they do they need to nerf them or the pay to win crowd will blow a gasket.  And for the first time I'd kinda have to agree with them.  It wouldn't be a big deal to me but it would be headed in a direction of 10000 atoms for a b2525 fixer I guess.
---
Power armor needs a couple buffs. One of them should be 90% disease resistance while in a complete chassis.
---
caps have 0 value already
---
Todd would approve only if toys are available in the atomic shop.
---
It's definitely possible.  I think this has been speculated on quite a bit.  I do feel like for some reason that if they were going to be put in it would've been when seasons launched to capitalize on that XP repeatable.
---
Thanks for the info.  I'm trying to see what the difference is between my loadout and those who AB works for.
---
The only people who want sex in games are the ones who aren't getting it IRL.
---
What’s your GPU usage at usually when playing? Mine keeps hitting 100% and spiking quite often.
---
This just isn’t true, I see people say it al the time and then I hear other people say the exact opposite (you have to charge before entering vats), I feel entirely confident saying it doesn’t fucking matter, you’re going to miss your first vats shot 95% of the time no matter what you do.
---
Reward random bonus or random disease.
---
I unequipped the Concentrated Fire. The mutated hit no damage but seems better now.
---
Nice!  Bookmarking that calendar.
---
I mean, I get it in real life. Just in game you don't need to shower or put on a fresh pair of clothes.
---
It seems like many people say this works.  I am interested in whether standing/crouching makes a difference.  At the end of the day I will tabulate the results of the discussion of each perk and post the results in the OP.
---
I’ve had that happen in the past, yesterday play NW all day before logging in to complete dailies. Maybe Bethesda fixed it but it is Bethesda so I logged in to adventure mode just in case.
---
All I can wish for with events that are known to spawn legendary enemies, is that some asshat doesn't decide to one shot it with their 2000+ damage stat bloodied gauss shotgun.
---
Let every person in the event get a hit or 2 on the enemy.
---
As for the Scorchbeast Queen. PLEASE STOP USING BUGGED MINIGUNS THAT MELT HER IN SECONDS.
---
It's getting to the point where going all the way to the event has become useless. You are not playing the game alone. Further more when it comes to the queen, stay off of the bunker and bunker fences. Not having a clear path to players will make it so that she doesn't land and dive bombs 90% of the time.
---
Well sure, but saying months is a stretch and clearly an exageration. I dont think people that level that slowly are interested in end game content.
---
wow no immersion!!! reeeee
---
I pulled a bloodied grenade rifle at the event, and I've been laughing all the way to the scrap box now. Even without demo on, I can solo Line in the Sand.
---
I agree, disabling grass should just be a graphics option available to all, along with sync and gore.  I disabled these things in the hope that my shambling old video card would be able to load the game better...and it saved me a whole second or two.  
---
Still have a lot of trouble in Morgantown, near the power plants, and in Nuclear Winter.
---
I won’t be home for about 7 hours but if you need further testing later I can test it and let you know.
---
2x AP refresh pieces and I saw little difference in refresh rate when disabling AB in my quick, unscientific test. Natural AGI is currently at 13 on the char.
---
Have you not seen the unarmed crouch spam?
---
I may have flunked outta biology but I'm pretty sure two people doing that is what sex is
---
My favorite is slug lung... your in suit that you go diving in and somehow you get what I would call respiratory disease (sorry coffee hasn't kicked in, can't think of the proper term).
---
ha
---
10/10 would listen to again
---
Well I just felt like putting this out there since players were experiencing their dailies auto completing when they went into NW a couple of days ago.
---
Bro do you even want any of the seasons stuff? Its like 70% crappy ghillie skins
---
I feel like atom shop has cooler stuff usually lol
---
I highly doubt anybody can repopulate the wasteland in all honesty...With half the population running low health with all them rads...and the other half taking all those drugs! Everybody’s sterile by now! 😂😂😂
---
I’ve only ever played for the rewards. I’ve had fun moments, but overall I never wanted battle royale in fallout. So yeah, S.C.O.R.E. Is the sole purpose right now. I managed to kill 7 players in a match(NOT typical for me), I think because so many players just as bad as me are also playing just for the score 😂
---
Oh fuk I forgot about the chicken coop you're right
---
I thought I was being nice by making a free vendor at my camp, giving away my known plans for those that needed it, but one guy would come along and take them all, even the ones that i had duplicates of... People are selfish, it's really that simple. And Reddit community ripped into me for trying to be nice like this and being upset that people are essentially assholes.
---
So now, instead of helping people that might need the plans and ammo I know won't sell, but some low level could get use out of, like .38, .44, .10mm, etc..., I drop them in my private server, so they disappear into the void.
---
Same goes for when someone dies on SBQ and you see everyone b-line to their loot bag to get their 3 Flux... like it's a going to make or break their game.
---
I feel your disappointment with this one, friend and share your frustration.
---
Hm interesting. That is low though it grows during a session. Do you get more problems the longer you play or is it stuttery from load-in?
---
An event/party wide xp and auto loot legendary would be really nice. Since you running with 3 pylons you cannot do much damage in robots or the impostor itself. Also the impostor will explode and many times you cannot find it afterwards.
---
I noticed the door is blocked.
---
You don't know if you don't try.
---
My daily gameplay includes at least a few nukes on the queen. Actually it is more nuking the queen and trying to do the rest in between. The rewards could be better (one star legendary shouldn't be possible as loot from the queen imho) but we wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't beneficial. I do have to mention we work in an organised group that does a ton of damage. It is more a matter of hurrying to get some shot in (for looting the dead queen) than actually wasting ammo.   
---
I wouldn't be nuking so much without our group, that is for sure.
---
My post explicitly states that I'm a PA user, there is no such thing as Unyielding PA.
---
Anyways, if diseases were to be turned into something the player actually should care about they also need to fire a lot less often. The way it is now it's that you can go through a ton of disease cures every single day because the moment mobs look in your general direction you contract whatever is on the menu.
---
U should have a look at T-65. They have nothing! It’s even missing head lights! For a end game power armor I’m really disappointed.
---
Except for the new skin at rank 80 or so now.
---
That sounds like it’s bugged. Supposed to summon a Scorchbeast to fight.
---
Oh I feel you. I had the same experience. Well, mostly.  
---
One toxic person was just trying to start PvP with everyone they saw. I saw they had melee weapon and no armor, so I thought maybe there was some kind of an achievement that they were trying to get (I was too noob to know back then). So due to my kind nature I decided to help them die.. Little did I know they would jump on the roof and use some kind of preset because they got full armor on and a different weapon. Well needless to say I died almost instantly and they got all my loot. I was about lvl 30 and they were 130 or something. I mean it was frustrating af, considering they killed me twice because my kind team mate of the same level decided to avenge my death.. only as soon as he engaged in pvp I became a target as well and got killed again xD Oh well. This still isn't worth to give any IRL threats to anyone, its just a game.. Though I reported that griefer xD
---
I just bought a 3 star bloodied GL for 1k.  I feel great 🤪
---
This is true. Lol 😂
---
so hypothetically i can use legs and helmet from X-01 (i also want to use headlamp mod) and rest can be ultracite and i will loose some DR stats and nothing else will change?
---
i always take down everyone who's wanted. and if the wanted player is stupid enough to run around with junk on him while being wanted, that's on him. the only time i won't go for the kill is when we are doing the Queen and the wanted is helping as well.
---
In 1 run doing this I was able to craft over 8,000 2mm EC ammo for my Junkies' Gauss Minigun which is orders of magnitude faster than using the ammo converter.
---
me. i don't hate NW, i just hate that they force people to do it if they want them to max out their *adventure* mode rewards. For the most part I've been actually playing, but last night i just said "fuck it" bc i didn't feel like playing for another 15 minutes, and left myself in bushes the entire match. only really touched my controller to move inwards. finished in the top ten lol
---
I also hate the "revive two players" NW quest. it can take a long ass time to get it organically, and i shouldn't have to coordinate with another player to swap near-deaths to complete it.
---
I'd be really nice to see this added. They should add a postbox to camps so people can leave little tips or things and add send to alt character as an option on that. Even if it's capped at say 50lbs or something.
---
imo, the game needs a major permanant cap sink, one that consumes more caps than can be earned in a given period of time. the gold bullion 6k a week was a good start, but once you get all the plans, theres no repeatable need for bullion. 
---
Therefore, the bullion trades probably benefit from some consumable, like legendary modules. hopefully at some point, there will be legendary modules that let you change to/from specific effects - which would be very valuable and would let them clear out caps and make them viable, especially if there are not multiple ways to acquire said items.
---
Really, id' settle for a soft cap-cap that would allow you to continue to acquire caps from vending/trading, but not from in-game activities, combined with a massive cap sink to the effect would even make me consider putting my top tier items in a vendor. Or a 'color-up' approach to caps, where I could trade a preset number of caps for a different currency at some predetermine cost rate to color up/down. ie 10k +1k fee = 1 golden cap, 1 golden cap + 1k fee = 10k caps, it jsut sucks money out of circulation, while allowing me to continue to trade in caps, especially if golden caps are tradable.
---
I literally ALWAYS have a disease and I’m so tired of it. I just ignore them now; it’s not worth popping a disease cure to immediately get another one from some random crossmap mole rat.
---
My Lone Wanderer Beth and I are expecting so not sure what you're getting at? (:
---
I spotted an AAE Fixer in a player camp, but after getting the last few caps together, I stopped to do Mischief Night one last time.
---
Double Facepalm came as the player logged off and I didn't note the name. Thankfully I found another AA/limb damage fixer for half the price a week or 2 later.
---
Nice collection. We need detailed combat log and these stuffs can be easily found and sorted out in PTS.
---
Because this game does not see fit to implement a safe way to trade 2 different items between players like other MORPG games for the last 20+ years, we are forced to request the help of a courier (Todd bless them) and actually use the time of a third party just to complete a safe transaction.
---
It's honestly mind blowing when you think about it.
---
Never go first.  If they won't go first get a trusted courier.  If they dont want a courier they were going to scam you.
---
Can I upvote this twice?
---
There is no need to remove them, just turn down the chance at which you can contract one.
---
For reference, they could use the same % value they use for actually decent weapon drops from Mumbles or random enemies. So, 0,1% or something.
---
Thiiiiis. I don't work on Wasteland Wallstreet, I don't know or care to know what the going rate is for every item. I'm just gonna sell or scrap what I don't want. My prices are off, oh well. 90% of my store are 10 cap plans anyway, so forgive me if some things aren't priced properly.
---
I hate the price tag of the card.  Encryptid is probably such an uncommon event not only because so few people are willing to follow simple instructions given to you during the event, but it doesn't help that once you spend the free card the game gives you at the end of the Lying Lowe questline, the only way you can get another is by spending caps, and obtaining some nuclear materials from nuked zones to craft one.  It's no wonder people don't really do it.
---
&gt;That being said, the time between matches is awful
---
this is easily my biggest gripe with NW. it takes freaking forever to get into the next game. they need to give an option after you die to hop into another lobby, or go back to the main menu.
---
I've never seen or heard of a Targeting Mod for Ultracite PA so I kept my T-60 helmet when I upgraded. Makes little difference other than a touch less tank as there's no full-set bonuses for standard PA types only Exc and SH.
---
So many battle bot cards. Many seconds of scrolling.
---
True, we need more thing that players want to spend caps on to get them out of the economy (things like smiley)
---
Tested action girl.  Getting about 20% uplift from having the perk.  Did some 500m sprints with and without.  It’s noticeable but not by much.  Sure it’s not 45%
---
Adrenaline isn't working for many people, are you sure, when you kill things you're damage is increasing? I tested all five of my characters with it, and it's not working at all since patch 20.
---
Yes :D Imagine if there would be some sort of skinning and you could loot and skin before it hits the ground.
---
Oh god dont give people ideas next week everyone in Appalachia will be doing this and I'm going to have to play with the sound off from then on
---
&gt;Survival and halloween each are non stacking xp challenges, xmas I hear is stacking
---
what do you mean by that?
---
Any good places to stock up on Nuka Cherry? Thanks!
---
Exactly, mix and match all you want. With the damage resist soft caps you probably won't notice any difference.
---
They constantly do. Always eating rotten food and dirty water.
---
Guarentee I've sold to vendors/scrapped rare items. Sucks. FO3/NV/4, best believe I've kept one of everything. In 76 it's just not possible due to storage. I'm not about to reference a list for every item I encounter to judge if it's worth keeping, so gotta get rid of em.
---
I believe this post deserves as many up votes as possible
---
I ignore all of them with the exception of Rattle Hands and Fever Claw. Those get cured immediately because fuck doing 25% less damage with ranged weapons.
---
I’m starting not to care about hitting the scrip limit or the cap limit. This game boxes me in on my earning potential, then boxes me in on my spend. I have no idea where the vendor tax really goes or why it exists. I consistently get useless legendaries in the field and the purveyor that only increase my carry weight. I have no clue what the economy is intended to be for this game, but I suspect that with each new currency type thrown into the game, there’s been little to no thought as to how it impacts the game ecosystem as a whole. Nothing ever seems to get retrofitted to accommodate the new premium currency.
---
I completely agree with you. And that further begs the question of whether the courier can be trusted or would he leave with two weapons or be in collaboration with the other player? Like you mentioned there's no method for safety.
---
I hate cazadors glad they are only out west??
---
sorry to hear that man, use the trade subreddit, its self policed, but the community has the ability to hire a courier to act as escrow for any trades. the couriers are listed and notable members, who are generally well known and have been proven trustworthy.
---
7 pies total on 4 characters, since day one. All from machines...
---
With every new currency type introduced, caps lose value. So I think we’re there already, so might as well up the cap or lift it altogether.
---
Wonder how many times exactly, and over how long a period, tbh. As in, because it's such common sense and yet somehow still isn't a thing.
---
If they do, I hope they remove the XP buff from the ones you buy. That creates a direct link to players’ ability to earn XP and the financial health of the game. 
---
The other things about them—the fun effects, small temporary buffs—those aren’t a big deal. I’d be fine with that being in the shop, but not directly purchasable XP boosts.
---
O crap. I just realized after reading this post I could have just swapped out my T-65 head for an x01 or Ultracite for the bright head lamp.
---
THANKS 
---
Still shitty that t 65 does not even have head lamps.
---
At this point due to the autocomplete bug I'd be happier just letting it run another few weeks or a month. I think a lot more people would be happier if the time table was simply extended a bit. Not everybody would get rewards still, but those effected negatively by the bugs at least would get a chance to make up for it. Especially the players who don't read reddit and aren't sure why it keeps happening. At least the arguing here might die down quite a bit.
---
Oh snap I must have never picked those up because I don’t think I could live with that either lol
---
What are the pies for? Are they just rare items?
---
You seem to be making a lot of assumptions and that probably will not work well for you communicating effectively. I am not going to go into that at all as it will not provide any value. What I am going to do, is point out a big fallacy in your reasoning. You say that bloodied builds are not appreciated, being seen as a solo-focused practice in a multi-player game. I can almost accept that. But you started this conversation telling me "If you're not prepared to take all 3 pylons and spam stimpacks on the roof, don't start the event solo." Now that does not seem like the multi-player way you seem to be advocating. I expected people to join. I did not expect people to expect me to do it solo even though they are there and I certainly did not expect to be flamed for it. Keep enjoying the game.
---
Diseases suffer the same problems as hunger and thirst in this game. Bethesda opted to put Survival-Lite features in this game, which I think was worthwhile to try out, but since nothing has any real world consequences it's all tedium instead of actual impact. If I get a disease, I'm generally happy to just wait it out and let it self heal.
---
The only reason I _really_ cure a disease is because the notifications at the top of my screen start to get distracting and I want them to go away. Otherwise, I couldn't tell you what any diseases actually do some 300+ hours into the game. This is compounded by the fact that for your first 50 levels, diseases seem to be less common. I think they tweaked that a bunch of patches ago when they made the Savage Divide a bit less difficult.
---
As a result of this though, the only time a disease would actually hamper you, you're strongly resistant to diseases. Then post level 50, when you're basically a walking bringer of death that nothing can touch, diseases don't actually impact you enough to matter. Maybe if you're min/maxing real hard into a Bloodied build it can be inconvenient? 
---
Anyhoo... either make diseases, hunger and thirst have actual detrimental impacts on our characters or just ditch the mechanics entirely. This middle ground, while worth trying and testing, hasn't really worked as anyone would have hoped.
---
OUR ANTHEM WILL DEAFEN THE HERETICS 
---
nah jk but I'll probably find more ways to be harmlessly irritating in the meantime
---
For weight purposes, I woul consider a fast 1H.  Something like a combat knife w/ serrated or stealth blade, or switchblade w/ serrated blade.
---
Reasoning: My 0.3# vampire switchblade (not FSS) will hit 3x in the time it takes a grognak Or supersledge to hit once.  At 80 dmg per hit x3 =  240 total, vs the grognak 180 or 210.
---
Combat knife hits for 96, but is slightly slower than the switchblade.
---
Those are pipboy damage numbers, BTW.  With the usual melee perks, I’ve had the switchblade do 500, more on a power attack.
---
I alos have a FSS switchblade, which will hit 4-5 times vs the grognak 1.  That one 1hits L42 ghouls and 2-3 hits L62 charred.  In under 1-1/2 seconds.
---
Caveat: I am spec’ed for melee; YMMV and all the standard disclaimers.
---
Thanks for the recommendation. That's the sad part is that you can't go and utilize a random discovery and trade for it without a significant chance of getting scammed.
---
Similar - I switched to commando around lvl 30.  I started scrapping Handmades at lvl 15 though.  I had to build / scrap almost 40 Handmades to get the mods unlocked I needed (and you can't do Commando until you unlock Powerful Auto).     
---
I never went back to Rifleman though.  You can pretty much treat the auto's like a semi with trigger control, and a double-tap from a good Handmade will kill 90% of the stuff in this game.  
---
I didn't like the combat rifle - too much recoil.
---
Shocking, garbage game attracts garbage players.
---
Fireproof intermittently fails.  Most of the SB fights or car explosions fail to harm me but every once in a while it provides zero protection.
---
I have no problems with completing it with just me and my husband. Just have the jukebox playing, no issues.
---
Admittedly we do go to the event as soon as we see it appear, but we do this for all events we want to do on the whole.
---
People suck dude, was trying to do the daily yesterday (kill 10 ghouls) went to whitespring where are 299 already was, most was already cleared but someone still down below, so I just put a few bullets in them so he could finish them so we both could get xp and progress, e however did not answer the same way and panic rushed all the remaining ones 
---
Ended up running past him and just killed the remaining ones
---
The way I see it, if you don’t want to do NW, you gotta spam the XP grind (not sure if the repeatable will change today) and get 30k xp to make up for it.
---
I wouldn't actually want more tanky enemies, if they make enemies tough enough to not be one shot by bloodied builds its gonna be a boring slog for anyone not playing bloodied. I've always preferred it when enemies are easy to kill with an accurate shot but they can take you out easily too. When is that major rebalance due to drop? That might make high level fights more interesting
---
I think most of their money comes from paying for expansions and for monthly passes (ingredient stash stuff just like for our scrap.)
---
With how many mutations I've accumulated, I'm not even legally a mammal anymore
---
I recently tested max damage on my weapon and the 60% was clearly showing in both the Effects tab and on actual damage done. But...I can't be sure that was after patch 20 so I will have to check.
---
It’s from the start.
---
Who cares
---
What a shame. I have always gone after wanted players; no matter the rank and no matter the cap bounty. In most cases, I will never take their junk if I kill them, although there has been an exception every once and awhile.
---
Adrenaline isn’t working very good for now, better change for kun-fu (something like this I don’t remember very good the name) until they fix it
---
(Perk I say is one that give 10% more dmg on vats)
---
And with other 2 u have free, u can put evasive
---
Interesting idea. I know what I'm trying tonight!
---
I’m just curious, how do you test it?
---
Not to mention the stable flux awarded, as well as Ultracite plans, which some can be worth some real good trade bait
---
For the longest time, I couldn't find some. Until recently... Someone selling in their vending machine. Bought all six. It was expensive, 3 for one character and transfered to another. Still need six more...PC
---
This is the way lol
---
Pressing Q with a shotgun is now considered cheating
---
Scrip limit gold limit and cap limit is a big one and also like the one guy said. The glitch to where people are about to get all rewards of pass in a day while I’ll take the whole month and then some to maybe get it
---
Well I wouldn’t mind if they added the drop to a hard event like the repair kit whenever they may add it to the atom store. Raids would be a good place to drop a lunchbox if they ever release again.
---
No kidding. I just dropped a ton. My gatling plasma is ultracite, I don't even know how I got 80 regular ones.
---
You're in a walking tank that can take direct hits from heavy ordnance, it has the same sort of function as an environment suit as you're protected from airborne contamination and it's sealed against water incursion allowing you to survive and breath for an extended period, plus it resists radiation.
---
Yet for all that R&amp;D, you're entirely vulnerable to a molerat who can bypass all of that to stick a disease to you. I think PA should grant full immunity to all diseases if you're wearing a full set.
---
I sell my Ultracite Plans for 20c a piece; Calibrate Shocks and Jet Pack excluded
---
&gt;that chance should be considerably lower
---
This right here. Louder for the people in the back rows please.
---
Like, yeah, *technically* we really shouldn't be getting diseases while in a PA. But I get it, there's *balance* to consider - I get that. Still, how realistic is it for critters waaaaaaaaay below my level to just, like, look at me and give me a disease? Just... no. Screw that already. PA has been getting the short end of the stick in too many other ways anyway.
---
Yall had a keyring in Fallout 3.
---
Events on the whole seem more busy but there are a few people just sitting idle waiting for free rewards. I think the harder events are still a bit ignored because there's no special loot from them anymore.
---
Same here lol
---
Only trust people with moderately high karma. Else use a courier. I've completed over 140 trades on here and never run into a scammer. Besides, some are very easy to spot.
---
So, here is my take on this. Anyone can be as frustrated as they want for things they are forced to endure. I did not force anyone to join the event. But further than that, if someone cannot handle their frustration, while playing a game, then I certainly will not handle someone shouting at me on his mic. And that was the whole point of this post.
---
Wait till your neon letters start randomly rearranging themselves , my "Bodega" turned into a "Godeba" lol
---
Good should take out the shitty terminal while they are at it
---
Everything that takes legendary modules is no transfer.
---
Yeah you're 8 hours ahead. Thanks!
---
A feral ghoul farts my direction im automatically contracted Rad Worms.
---
Any time I've gotten a bounty, I dump my junk immediately, fast travel to Vault 76, strip naked, and crouch awaiting my fate.
---
Yeah if i'm solo in a team inspirational doesn't work for me.
---
SAME I was like wdym it’s hard to get? And now I’m like oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no WHERE IS IT I KNOW I HATED THAT PIECE OF DUCT TAPE
---
Sorry for the late reply, but [this video](https://youtu.be/zdVf6kfak0U) might be helpful with reducing the footprint of your crops
---
Good perspective. Like basic repair kits vs improved
---
They have solo. You just need to disengage "Team Fill" when you go to enter the mode.
---
I unequipped all of my armor and any perks that had anything related to AP refresh.  Made sure I had no AP buffs Active.  I then, sprinted til I had an empty AP bar and timed with a stopwatch how long it took to go back to full with and without action girl.  It was the same time.  
---
What's funny is I would've never noticed this because I run like 4 AP refresh armor pieces on most characters in adventure but I was playing NW and had it on and I was like hey this perk isn't working because I KNOW how much AP i should be regenning in NW and sure enough when I went to go test in adventure, borked.
---
Now a better version for end game events sounds great.  Now we just need more end game events.  Jk
---
Also what’s up with diseased robots?
---
For survival and Halloween they each have challenges which require separate, resetting XP goals. So when you reach the first goal to get the first reward, the xp gained resets to 0 towards the next goal/reward. As an example, it would be like 250 for the first reward, then it resets to 0, then 500 for the next, reset and so on. 
---
For xmas the xp gains dont reset from one to the next, at least that my understanding. Its basically just a difference in how the xp is recorded. It doesnt really make much difference.
---
Also xp counts towards all three at the same time, which make it's a LOT easier to get all the rewards.
---
Thanks. For now we will call this one crippled.
---
True, i use the fixer plans to make it for lower levels cause its already got good mods on and its a good weapon but still to get a legendary one, to be fair i dont usually buy guns anymore as i get legendary modules for gauss shotguns. Does anyone know the drop chance for a legendary fixer.thanks
---
Haven't checked out the vid yet altho I intend to when I can
---
But did you or your friend have any running speed boosting perks or mutations? Because there is a maximum to how much you can have your running speed increased 
---
Also "aiming" just means having the gun out, I don't think it means when you actually aim down sights, I don't think that is affected at all actually
---
Edit - watched the vid, yea try again without aiming down the sights
---
"Did someone say quality of life improvement that should have just been a base aspect of the launched game? Get it NOW*!!!!!!"
---
*with a valid Fallout 1st subscription
---
That's a solid plan! I aggree, there's a severe lack of currency sinks.
---
Consumables are a great "sink"! We could do with more "crafted" events like the Encryptid, some beneficial consumables ( vendors that sell soups or food for "good enough" bonuses), also give more ammo to NPC vendors! The one thing you are using constantly, you can either craft it or buy it! A vendor that would reskin / remod your gear for caps or scrip or bullion? More "rare" outfits - pristine, what could be more rare than a brand spanking, "never removed from box", outfit ... (old new stock)....
---
I think they are waiting for us to love them...desire them and then release them. Like their mistake about releasing repair and improved repair kits at the same time
---
&gt;What I don't get is how you've played the game for an extensive amount of time, or you've alluded too, since the person you're arguing with stated he has as well... Yet... For some reason you can't use your own experience to gauge whether those "Maybes" are right or wrong?
---
That happens all the goddamn time in this sub Reddit lol.   People tell me that what I have seen with my own eyes never actually happened. Because data miners said so.  Or because some guy on youtube said so.
---
Can confirm
---
Yeah that's a good point.  To be honest they could do it whenever they damn well please.
---
I just want a different skin for Chinese stealth armor.
---
Yes, and ***thank god for that.***
---
Still, it'd be cool to see what the early capital wasteland looks like.
---
Yea 1 PA skin spread over 5 rewards, ghillie over a few rewards and some random stuff.... That combat rifle skin looks so lazy it's just all black. Snooooore Annoyingly I actually want that fireplace kinda badly which is a really high level reward
---
Instigating lever action or hunting rifle should one shot most things, even without the rifleman perks. So I run a stealth commando with a bloodied auto combat rifle, but use an instigating hunting rifle for most things to save ammo.
---
Oof! That’s a good one. I’ve been seconds away from pressing buy on some god rolls and the player logs off leaving me falling to my death like salt on a wound
---
Good perspective, yeah it needs a nerf if it’s in the atom shop
---
Dude you are so downvoted I have to break my mouse wheel to scroll down to your troll replies. Just rest assured that with the way you are posting/commenting, I have to do absolutely nothing to show you how superior I am. Go lie under your bridge you little troll. Ciao!
---
I just logged on to test Action Girl \*\*\* and for me it is working.  5 tests each:  
---
With AG on, running around camp to exhaustion, time to recover to full (seconds):
---
* 11
---
* 11.4
---
* 11.2
---
Without AG on, time to recover (seconds):
---
* 14.7
---
* 14.5
---
* 14.8
---
* 15
---
Timing isn't exact, as I'm doing the running and hitting iphone stopwatch myself.  Also not quite 45% (probably need more exact measurements for that) but close enough.
---
That's still not solos lmao just because you're on your own and everyone else is in a team
---
If it was a reward for harder events, I’d def grind em
---
Top of west two always has one
---
Can confirm this is works but ONLY if you’re wearing the tattered field jacket and you have a camp build at precisely 83% capacity.
---
Same thing for duo mode, just make your team from the main menu and then turn team fill off
---
Maybe I have a life and don't play a game for 4 years straight. Cut out that crap acting like everyone's experience is the same. I've played for half of that with a 2 year gap in between, and I already stated I played Fallout 4 modded so my experience was difference because I and everyone who has downloaded such mods hated the fast draining cores. I was trying to politely say he was wrong until proven right, that this happens all the time on reddit and turns into an echo chamber, so until it's proven that's his opinion, not fact, and if it's true we don't know if it's a bug or by design. To use your analogy that would be like skipping the fingerprinting and ballistics test of a shooting and throwing someone in jail without a trial based on eyewitness accounts.
---
Little by little we get more events
---
If you're not buying atoms Bethesda doesn't give a shit about what you do with the free ones as long as you're eventually burning them on something.
---
Broken ghillie skins at that

I don't know if the player-base is big enough for this.  I think it's possible it could be on xbox since we seem to have the biggest player-base for the mode based on what I've seen spending lots of time watching other people on other platforms play NW on twitch.  On Xbox we find games almost instantly all the time and it's lots of different faces every time.
---
I always just do no-fill anyways and usually run solo or with a team of 2 or 3.
---
Have you tried up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, Start?
---
Yup
---
Yes, but most of the time its going to be a 1v4 
---
What I'm talking about is a 1v1
---
instigating hunter/sniper rifle for actual long range sniping
---
furious lever, handmade, fixer for closer in work..
---
Yeah or give us more leeway for building near 1. Eachothers camp and 2. At existing locations, i have wanted to do a raider camp but cant find a spot with raider builds or existing enemy spawns. I dont know how to build a raider camp completely from scratch.
---
zomg pls stop spreading xploitszzz!111!
---
Yeah. That doesn't work.
---
Please just stick to my glitch. Don't confuse people.
---
Absolutely not what this post is about. Tattling would be naming the idiot and asking for retribution/punishment. I posted this to sanity check my approach on this and you missed the point as much as I missed the event. Thanks for playing.
---
I can see it now, everybody staying at home playing Fallout 76 in their camps playing Skyrim.
---
I get object is floating, item intersects existing item, etc. Camp building is broken for me until ther fix these two errors espescally item intersects existing item. I want my stuff to intersect with each other.
---
Doesn’t the in-game clock need to be at 8:03 a.m.?
---
You can play solo - or indeed in a team of just 2. 
---
Simply select team fill off. You get this option when you highlight NW mode so select team fill off before selecting the mode. If you want to play with one or 2 other friends in your team then invite them to a team via the social tab prior to selecting Nuclear Winter mode, ensuring team fill is off.
---
And people look for the targeting HUD as well, not as high of a demand as the two you listed. But that's about right though. Just a couple to look for that give that extra little incentive
---
1 cap each for me... Don't care if a high level flips them. Just like helping new players and freeing up stash space. I get lots of plans/recipes/mags/ boobleheads. Four characters with treasure maps.
---
Worked for me so well that I’ll be you 10,000 flux it worked better than yours.
---
Damn, I'm on ps4 and I always run in to the same people
---
They are called Modern Paintings and if I still have an extra I will gladly give you the plans for such a cause.   I'm very sorry for your loss, friend.
---
Instigating Lever Action if you don't want to go Bloodied; Bloodied Lever Action if you go Bloodied.
---
Secondary Legendary, you'll want Explosive for some extra damage (though the splash might damage nearby enemies negating Instigating bonus). 10% Damage While Aiming isn't bad either.
---
Hunting Rifle has a little more punch but the Fire Rate and slower reload make the Lever Action better.
---
Hindsight is 20/20 and all that, but here's what you should have done. Join or make an event group in the area, wait 5 mins to bond up, start the event, do the "beckon/ call over here" emote that will show in the lower left corner for the whole party to see - making them teleport to you (for free btw). And there'd prolly be others joining too naturally because of the serverwide message in the upper left corner once the event starts.
---
It's a somewhat rare event to see these days, so it's odd that people didn't join and help out :/ Time of day is somewhat important too I suppose. Good luck in the future! :)
---
I totally agree with that, I think that's the way things should be done.
---
My complain is only about people camping spawns. The mobs aren't near the objective at all and they are already dead.
---
I'm thinking of getting another 1st month in order to have time to enjoy the events although I think 1st is too expensive for what it is.
---
Looks like a mod
---
No. Stop adding shit to confuse people.
---
My glitch is sound. The only thing you need to get right is the angle of the jump, the distance, the Vertibird shooting, and the Atom store code.
---
I saw a camo chinese pa skin once. Gave me hope
---
its complicated and you need at least 10.000 leader bobbleheads i dont think you might have the connection to those
---
Bruh I bought if for 60 at release 😭
---
This is one that I know

You need an Assaultron Recall card to start the event
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recall\_keycard\_recipe](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recall_keycard_recipe)
---
Blocker seems to be working for me. I take significantly less damage from a pack of feral ghouls with it on. If it’s useful, I am PA melee.
---
I know you don't have to show how superior you are. Your style is more coming to write online how you WOULD HAVE PvP'd some big bulli if you only had the chance. What a huge elite player! If only you had the chance you could show me! But alas you're just a dejected neet with no accomplishments.
---
Hell yes, I only spent 1820 atoms though. So I feel thats an absolute win
---
True.  It would be nice if the BOS update included 2+ SBQ style events at launch or a raid now that we have team match making(raid on enclave facility mabye or the dive into prime fissure).  That way when the update launches and have the most participation to keep a strong player base.  I dont care what bethesda does as long as it keeps making enough money to keep the lights on without going full mobile game.
---
They are extremely hard to get. So if you have one - that means you have an iron will, significant patience and a lot of a free time.
---
I suggested they change hunter and hunted radio to open yourself up to survival pvp instead. So ur idea isnt bad either. Make it so u only see ur friends and people who wanna pvp on the map.
---
&gt;You're arguing that they didn't drain FCs fast because you invested the levels, lntelligence score, and perk points into making them drain slower. You are literally arguing that it was fast enough to need a perk for it. 
---
I did the exact same thing in Fallout 76.   Invested 3 levels in a perk that doubled the life of Fursion cores. 
---
In Fallout 4, no noticeable drain on fusion cores with jet packs with that perk. 
---
In Fallout 76, a  very noticeable drain with the same perk that does that same thing. 
---
You're telling me that what I saw with my own eyes, what I have tested and re-tested dozens of times never actually happened.  That seems to be a thing around here but it's pretty ridiculous.
---
i got every disease in the game at once and almost got killed on  the spot
---

---
Hold up, you wanna know what player dropped the first nuke?
---
The place camp NW daily is easy. Did the one last night that required 30 minutes of playtime.
---
Can i have a refund on the 15 seconds i spent reading that?
---
Really?
---
Weird, because the memory editing from this code should give you 2,000.
---
Maybe the angle was slightly off.
---
Can confirm an instigating lever does one shot most things. I use one during the day on my nocturnal sniper. Yes, I have one of those. They're way more fun than people realise.
---
No idea, it just worked..lol I wish I had screenshot
---
Yuup lol
---
I'm still in it to try and get the fireplace and spaceman power armor but I'm not too hurt if I don't get too far
---
[There](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gyd9db/all_transmissions_decoded_an_update_on_patch_20s/) thread with 5 decrypted BoS messages. If you don't afriad spoilers ofc.
---
Sorry I meant by the first players
---
You are on Reddit in the middle of the day. Unless you are a freelancer like myself, the only thing I could be refunding you is lost time for wanking and watching a Netflix series.
---
I'm not really flaming you, I'm just saying that if you don't have any build flexibility, don't get mad when people talk shit because you can't adapt to the situation in an event as it emerges and Encryptid is definitely an event to avoid spending your own caps on if you lack flexibility. People have been talking shit about the way other people are playing ever since the first LAN party, but Fallout 76 isn't withholding the ability to improvise and adapt when necessary. You were the one who said your build was preventing you from taking care of the pylons.
---
I do still run rifleman sometimes when I want to take my gauss or lever out for a spin, but yeah I was running a handmade from level 15 as well. I also am not a fan of the combat rifle at least when free aiming, that recoil is a problem.
---
I think he meant what player dropped the first nuke
---
It is 100% artificial, though the caps are per-character. So if you level up a second character you have twice the limit for the day- you just can't share gold or things purchased with gold. 
---
The whole point of the daily reset created by the devs was the ensure that players are exposed to the atom shop on a daily basis. Back in the day, the people handing the atom shop were actually **kind of creative** with this concept, and put out daily sales of items. You'd get a list of what would be on sale when every week with the atom shop update. But, gosh, *innovation sure is hard*, and that stopped after a few months. These days we'll only get a handful of sales each week, if that- and few of them are worthwhile. But they'll keep frustrating players with their archaic policies for... reasons!
---
I actually dig the combat rifle skin since it doesn't have a lot of options otherwise, but yea exactly
---
Yup, I’ve been raged at for killing someone with a bounty. It’s surreal, literally a game feature. If you rage at me I’m gonna take your junk :)
---
3 and NV did in fact have a keyring. For some arcane idiot reason they removed it in 4.
---
Hmm. For me, he still says Monday: /
---
Explains why i was taking more damage than usual on SBQ after the patch...
---
Great! I am glad somebody could confirm it. Now I am happy.
---
nice
---
Yeah i've watched quite a bit of PS4 nuclear winter on twitch and the community seems reallyyyy small.  Like a lot of times I see streamers in queue for multiple minutes trying to find a match.  I don't think I've been in a queue for a game on xbox for more than a few seconds ever.
---
Yeah I got that now, I'll leave it up for anyone interested lmao
---
PvP was never mentioned anywhere. BTW why are you so interested in my accomplishments or lack thereof? Is this how you aspire to measure your worth? By comparing your troll life to the assumptions you make for people you disagree with online? You are priceless!
---
A Fixer might be pretty good?
---
If you’re having issues with that turn on pacifist mode in the settings :D
---
Let us aim and hit up on the dpad to ping this is a beautiful thing.
---
Lets us use 4 nuke codes to revive someone dead on our team.
---
As for myself... Near 20k atoms. I just bought bundles at discounted prices. Once in a while, camp skins and canopies.
---
I hoarded Atom so I didn’t have to grind too hard. I need that Monkey Stein.
---
18? God damn boi, there are only 21 in the game
---
HOW DARE YOU!
---
I have hulu!
---
Can confirm it works on Pc too
---
Inspirational under Charisma, then join a Public Group.
---
*and if you don’t straighten up and fly right then, by golly, I will turn this car around and go RIGHT BACK HOME to Flatwoods!*
---
It's not 100% reliable but I generally google it and it comes up with this website.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki
---
Do you know how big the xbox player base is in general?
---
There are 2 claws. The mirelurk claw and the mirelurk Queen claw, the Queen is not in game yet.
---
No there isn't. I would just go on YouTube and have a look at whatever it is you want to buy :)
---
Except it's not a bug? Events have several predetermined respawn points. For scorched earth most of which are located around the fissure because ostensibly that is where the event takes place. The actual bug is the game not immediately registering those spawns and instead dumping you outside of the nuke zone.
---
With Gauss Rifles (or at least some) it‘s the opposite somehow, i have 0-10 headshot hitchance displayed in vats for an enemy located 500m away from me and i hit 95% all the time sniping them from the other end of the map.
---
With Handmades its like: Oh, i have 95 hitchance, nice. Shot 1.... miss, Shot 2... miss, Shot 3... guess what? ... miss, shoot 4..... ooooh finally.
---
Correct.
---
Actually xcom is less absurd, because in xcom it's just a matter of pure chance to miss, in fo76 it is simply bad programming/ a bug.
---
I was not saying you are flaming me. That was for the idiot ingame. As I said, time and again, I had a card and wanted to farm. I did not expect to finish the event without help and I would never flame anyone for not helping. But getting flamed for not doing everything on my own is where I draw the line.
---
The ultimate 5 second rule
---
Kills gotta be worth more to be worth doing ya.
---
I have tried googling it ofc and it also directed me to that website and it's not reliable at all in this situation, sadly. after some failed attempts I decided to ask here, because here is usually more info than on that website. But thanks for reply
---
sometimes you get "bad vats" and have to re-engage it
---
So you've rushed through using exploits, congratulations
---
Inspirational. Its a charisma 3 star perk card. Each star adds +5% exp when in a group up to a total of +15%. Also, the more charisma you have the more exp you get from group events and the more intelligents you have the more exp you get from everything like in past Fallout games.
---
This is so sad, I hate videos about games xD But thank you for replying.
---
I wish there was a way to get numbers on this.  I've been saying for years that I want xbox live to have a tool similar to steam charts so we can see how many people are playing.
---
Yeah that’s more of a trench coat, which isn’t quite what I’m looking for
---
Yeah the really missing the mark on the impulse purchase.
---
If the season pass was behind a paywall and about 10x easier, people would absolutely pay for it.
---
The perception of value is so good, but instead they are banking on people buying levels but the perception there is less items.
---
Their marketing team suck, all the vets will smash it out for rewards but that casual crowd is where they should be looking to pull cash from.
---
I had a scout mask sitting in my inventory, my stash was full so I had to make room, I looked at the mask and was like what is this ugly thing and scrapped it
---
What they mean is a mode against other all solo players or other all duos
---
Should report that psycho to Bethesda and make sure they respond.
---
I would too if it had maybe 2 textures to it. It looks like one flat colour over the whole thing
---
No what they mean is everyone is in solo or duo - not a solo against 4 man teams
---
You’re totally able to get this far legit if you have a good XP build and grind a lot.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y7fRHjGGOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y7fRHjGGOY)
---
You could launch a nuke in the forest during the BETA
---
Its fallouts battle royal. It's more balanced then adventure cause u cant vats players. Your special is shared from adventure which I hope they seperate it tho. it hinders it a bit for mr cause it's a Neat idea  at first but it doesnt execute well when things work differently in both modes. It's a very nice spin of fallout on br and Bethesda deserve credit there. But there so slow to update it and add fixes.
---
Is not weekly reset is on Tuesday? Like literally next hour
---
If it helps, seems like Action Boy is bugged right now so you aren’t missing out on anything
---
Not always.  I was off work xmas week, and spent most of my free time playing.
---
end result was, of the multipage list of rewards (remember the spreadsheet someone created?)
---
I had multiples of every item on that list - some more than others - but the ones I have in my machine are legit.
---
I know that likely puts me in the minority, but it is possible.
---
I would also like this option but I’m also not sure if the community is too small. I see a lot of the same face even on Xbox but it could possibly just be the times I play
---
Yeep!  I have fully ranked Fireproof and was taking no damage from SB sonic blasts over the weekend.  I guess I'm in the lucky 50%, but I'll check when I get home.
---
Happened to me....but I thought it was because I couldnt place camp for some reason....
---
What info is it you're after? I find it annoying as well, especially with the camp items too. I wish I could see the actual item rather than just a picture of a plan.
---
“I’m hoarding my atoms to buy levels.”
---
That’s exactly the plan. Remember, seasons are only 10 weeks, so there’s going to be 3-4 weeks between them. I fully expect those off-season weeks to be when major new content drops—and the Atomic Shop cosmetics that go along with it. 
---
If you’ve already dumped all your Atoms on finishing the season, you’ll need to use actual money to buy the BOS, Enclave or whatever must-have bundle that shows up on the shop the next week. This new challenge/reward setup is specifically designed to eat up free Atoms, as are the consumable items. 
---
This could actually have a net-positive effect. When players have to actually buy Atoms, they will begin to have a more tangible cash value. Right now a bundle might cost 1800 Atoms, but that’s not really $18 because most players have been swimming in free Atoms for forever. Even if you need to buy some, very few people are actually paying for the whole thing. 
---
Once people actually need to buy $15-$20 worth of Atoms to buy their virtual merchandise, they’ll be more cautious with their purchases. As such, Bethesda will have to adjust pricing to keep revenue where they want it—so things will likely get cheaper.
---
I'm glad you brought this up. I made a new character and the first thing I did was action boy rank 3 for sprinting across the map. It was taking FOREVER. I couldn't remember it being that slow and I swore that the perk wasn't working. I felt stupid until I read your post, though.
---
Yeah I see that now, wasn’t clear in OP
---
The MISC tab is a nightmare to navigate through xD Some of the key items I've got 10+ of in a row, not even stacking. IMO there should be an additional tab after ammo named Keys and be only for keys and keycards/passwords etc. So actual quest items and misc items would be in the misc tab.
---
Just my 4 cents
---
I always do it for that reason but oftentimes no one wants to do line in the sand.
---
Lol no you aint stupid.. smart actually for noticing.
---
Secret fireplace. I want it soooo bad
---
I use my Vamp Gatling Plasma. Works a treat.... while I have cores anywsy😏
---
Tryhardlevel 10/10
---
Those MK skins and the lvl 100 one seem worth grinding for, but I haven’t been able to bring myself that far in NW at all
---
I am gonna check how to do it. Thanks.
---
I am sorry about your kitty
---
I'm saying people have experienced "noticable" changes before and it's turned into an echo chamber of "me too" when there is no bug or change. You didn't state you did multiple tests before. Yet you can't provide numbers to prove your tests are anything but subjective. That seems to be a thing around here but it's pretty ridiculous.
---
Wasn't there also one in FO4 or was that a mod? It's been ages since I played that.
---
It works but speed demon already Maxes you out.
---
I also eith there was a nuclear winter tracker
---
Correct
---
Between my friend and I - we got 4 pies in watoga last night.. it was weird
---
I use a Bloodied Sneak Rifleman VATS build. If you're looking for the most outright damage per shot, hands down get a Gauss Rifle. Below that, for damage, I think the Railway Rifle, although seems like it isn't viable for stealth (haven't tested it that much myself). Less damage but more versatility, Lever Action. A little less damage than that but more versatility is the Handmade. Then, at the bottom of the top, every commando build's favorite gun. The Fixer; less damage than the handmade, but again more versatility. Plus the increase to sneak can be very tempting.
---
I personally run a Gauss Rifle and a Handmade at all times rn. I also only shoot headshots. So Handmade damage is an average of 1100-1200 damage per hit on every regular enemy and 150-200 on SBQ in air. Gauss rifle damage is at very least 2k for an uncharged shot on regulars and I hit SBQ for 1.5-2ks for fully charged shots.
---
With the gillie suit, it's kind of fun to sit there and watch the timer click up while I scroll reddit.
---
Like... a gun?
---
Ditto.
---
I know right xD And I'm after the gold bullion plans of armor. but I have no idea what the specs are. Google directs me to wiki which isn't informative at all or some videos on YT, but I really hate to watch and listen for 10 mins about something I could look up in a matter of 1 minute. besides not all videos are about what they claim, so you'll have to spend more time looking for the right one.. I usually don't have a problem with other items in game. But gold bullion are not caps, lol
---
TRUE. It's super easy to feel accomplished if I compare myself to the lil turtle bois who can't even flip themselves back over (its you).
---
I had a similar thought this morning while clearing out WesTek with bloody mess and explosive harpoon.
---
Frequently, the heads and torso viscera will hang in midair for a few seconds, including the ones that look like they are wearing the white pot helmet.
---
Two weeks ago, this would have been just another head, but since I've moved to using cranberry relish, every time this happens my brain now thinks,
---
"Hey, sugar."
---
THANK YOUUU. This is usually my attitude with all of the internet AND PVP gaming. I play games for my enjoyment and go online for leisure and learning experiences. I have zero tolerance for keyboard warriors. I'm anti troll. Firmly rooted in this cesspool of a reality that has enough of its own problems without spoiled overgrown children. Which right now there are WAY TOO MANY OF. It's a generations issue and a generational gap. 
---
Because of the toxicity of online gaming these days I haven't touched it in like two months and I'm probably still being charged for Fallout 1st. Can't stand people. Parents, raise your f'n kids.
---
I have the same thing in front of my CAMP.  Can't remove the stairs or the floor I attached to them.  Now I just have a turret platform in front of my house.  Maybe when I move the CAMP it will go away.
---
And have a LOT of ammo, and coordinate Lunchboxes with teammates... and full Unyielding Armor...
---
Agreed! 3 star legendary should always drop 3 * loot! And no more rolling pins!
---
Fuck those people. You shouldn't be nice. They learn nothing from it.
---
Yes!
---
As soon as you start to limit the earning/spending potential, can you even call that an economy?  
---
Planned economies have been tried in the real world, and I'm confident enough to say that they do not work (long-term, wartime is different).
---
I'd equate this to not paying your employees for overtime, mandatory or voluntary ... Yeah try keeping anyone who knows their self-worth at a job like that.
---
Atleast if the cap was out of reach for most players, I would probably still hit it but not within 1-2hr of game time! (yeah, one nuke zone is enough to empty vendor caps and run out of scrip)...
---
Raider Daily (3) + Foundation Daily (3) + Davenport (3) = 9 treasury, then 2+ per public event, that's not a daily commitment either, Dailies are done within 10 minutes, you can do whatever and just jump at every event that pops up and reach the cap in a short time also! Combine the two together and you get 1,5-2,5 hrs of meaningful gameplay per day. Everything you do beyond that just eats up from the things you "can" or "have to" do the next day... and so the snowballing begins... I almost am in this situation after this weekend... yeah had fun with them nukes ... jumping at every event except for radiation rumble/project paradise .... have legendaries to spare, treasury notes in excess ... will not have to do pretty much anything even tomorrow, but I will do the dailies atleast so it'll just keep on adding up.
---
We need to start vaccinating our kids 😩
---
I'm usually the one who takes all three and it's not worth it 90% of the time. I use maybe 50 stims but all I use are supers. It sucks.
---
Athletics, archer, swimmer.
---
Do NOT make a crossbow. it will take a long time to break. Instead you can find one near the archery range at the palace of the winding path.
---
ask here for someone to come and die for you in water. they might want a tip. they might do it for free.

And here's all the answers  [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Pioneer\_Scout\_Badge\_Exam\_answers#Musician](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Pioneer_Scout_Badge_Exam_answers#Musician)

from start to finish it took me 2 hours and a good chunk of that time was spent trying to break the crossbow
---
It’s a multiplayer game so you need to press select then start
---
What about it
---
They’re just uncultured and should feel bad. It definitely means too long; didn’t read. That acronym has been around way longer than that sub, lol.
---
I got 2 in a row on Sunday night at Watoga and at the Rusty Pick. I've gotten it one other time towards the beginning
---
I put one in my vendor for 10K caps because I don't have budget for many display cases. 
---
And if someone wants to sink their excess caps into it, it's not like I have a deep attachment to it.
---
Fixed.
---
Omg is this why I lag? I have every bobble head and magazine and my cooking is soooo slow
---
It's how people naturally are..
---
The secret service armour?
---
There’s always that one grinch in the bunch
---
We have 1 hour until reset... it is too early.
---
That's because it's new with the latest update.  Go check out the observatory as well.
---
Wish that had happened to me.  I got 2 challenges done just as the daily ticked over (killing ghouls at the golf course got me the 10, and someone happened to be buying something from my vendor for the other challenge).  But everything else auto-completed and didn't credit me any S.C.O.R.E    
---
So I am now down 1,250 S.C.O.R.E. points towards the season pass.  Which is not brilliant when you consider there already aren't enough dailies and weeklies to complete the pass, and you have to grind the bonus something like 6 or 7 times a week to make the end of pass.  
---
Thankfully I am ahead of the curve for now, but I was hoping to put more effort in now so I could take it easy near the end; not slog my guts out for 10 weeks to cover Bugthesda's glitchy programming &gt;.&gt;  
---
I put a ticket in, and basically got a 'well we're not going to do anything about it, has this solved your problem' response.  Which was expected, given the state of the company in general, but less than impressive.
---
Thank you man, I appreciate it.
---
all of them, I wanted to compare to know which one to buy
---
You will also need a lot of steel, which is easy to run out of depending on your looting habits.  I feel like a better low level approach is to go to an interior space with a lot of mole miners or scorched, wipe them all out, then collect the guns.  Big Bend used to be perfect because there were a lot that I could easily kill and there were crafting tables at the East side.
---
With an excavator all kitted out and not needing to get xp as badly these days, I just go to Hornwright Test Site #3 and collect all the iron ore in the area.
---
Oh yeah those are pretty close, thanks!
---
There is no reason possible to give a death threat over a video game...
---
Ok , thanks 👍
---
Claim one, then swap servers. Rinse and repeat till done.
---
This idiotic comment keeps popping up, there’s a lot of ground between “nearly impossible” and “give all the rewards for free”. Don’t be a fucking troll. The nuclear winter event to get the ghillie suit lasted about a month. If you played hours a day, you could get it in a week, if you spread it out you’d finish in a month. It gave everyone a CHANCE a least. The problem is the SCORE is gated by dailies and weeklies with only the repeatable 10k xp one avail to keep progressing, but you can’t really do that repeatable enough times in a day to make up for a day of lost dailies/weeklies. The problem is it requires playing every day and more, if there was a way to “get ahead” so you could then take a few days off and not be behind that would be a much better system, that way it’s the same amount of effort and play time but you can be flexible in your schedule, spam up multiple ranks on the weekend when ur available but if you go on vacation or whatever you aren’t screwed and forced to spend atoms. I’m not asking for it to be for free and to be honest that is a completely disingenuous and moronic thing to imply bc even if you have one flickering brain cell you damn well know that’s not what I said, you’re just trolling. I’m asking for a better and more fair system.
---
Never saw anyone mention that the caps cap used to be 25k. They may increase it again in the future.
---
Yes imagine thinking threatening to murder your family is any way aberrant behaviour. 
---
Because that is how normal decent people carry on ....threats to kill.
---
Not that hard to get at all.  You can climb onto the roof at West Tek and just pick one up.  
---
The machines give it out based on an equation that is affected by luck.  If you are using unyeilding armor it gives them more often.   Average around 2 pies a week from the 3 machines I see often, only clicking on them one time each.  Someone will always buy them from my vending machines though so I'm not complaining.
---
Yeah. But still, it is too early. Seems fishy. I hope it wont bugs out at reset time.
---
nail on head
---

Thx for the headsup, Ill go and try Gun Fu.
---
Why would it be called "Faster Movement Speed While Aiming" if its intended to work when you are not aiming?
---
For the Chameleon mutation to work, you need armor with the  Weightless  legendary effect.
---
Leather armor is currently the only armor on which the Shadowed mod (harder to detect in dark places) works.
---
On the other hand, Unyielding armor with a low-health build gives so much Agility, and hence sneak bonus, that things like the Shadowed mods and Chameleon mutation barely even matter anymore. If you want a Stealth build, this is actually the route I'd recommend, unless you want to intentionally make things harder for you than they need to be.
---
Secret Service armor is definitely a possibility, both for Unyielding and Weightless.
---
This is blessed but also cursed
---
Name calling and a completely undeserved inflated sense of self. You are only missing a MAGA hat and your wife/sister by your side. Anyway, I want you to know that I will no longer be responding to your pointless blabber. I will be ignoring you very explicitly and I just want you to be absolutely certain that I do not give a single f\*ck about you.
---
I am not saying I personally want the diseases to be removed, it is more of a prediction of what would happen in my opinion. And reducing the disease chance would be similar to making the hunger and thirst meters drain slower, but the devs decided to simply remove that mechanic. I would not mind though if there was a separate "hardcore" survival mode, rather than having these elements in adventure in a watered down way, but (judging from what happened with the previous survival mode) I have doubts if enough effort would be put into implementing and balancing such mode to keep enough people interested in playing it.
---
Everyone wants to blame it on the perks. Here you go, enjoy a video showing what it looks like when Ground Pounder, Frog Legs, explosives, and any other excuse is taken out of the picture.
---
https://youtu.be/e-J8OnmFaBQ
---
Omg thank you so much! This is exactly what I was looking for. Cheers!
---
This is amazing LOL
---
There's no direct comparison, but there's a list of everything Regs sells [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Reginald_Stone), with links to the descriptions and stats of each items.
---
Are all your old weeklys still there
---
Im worried they reset at 11 and completed all events
---
I have a ton of duplicates on my main but I only have 1 on my 2nd. They weigh nothing so it's fine, but I do agree with you that dropping dupes would be nice. However, they won't do it because they'd prefer that people find keys for themselves rather than have them dropped at their feet.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Yeah, odd.
---
You're welcome :) happy to help out
---
Yeah they are all there, and I done them.
---
The true test will be what lessons BGS learns from this first season and how they address the community feedback going forward. They put the NW challenge in there so that people who play it can still make some score progress, but the problem is that, assuming people have the correct assumptions and have done the math right, the score you get and the score you need cuts it way too close, and if the NW challenges are not "bonus" score, than they have a serious design flaw with the system.
---
I wish some people would stop treating nuclear winter like the plague, though. It's a fun side diversion, albeit the fact it's still listed as being in beta on the mode select screen tells you what you need to know.
---
That’s all fair and well. But perks still provide a potentially huge advantage. With my setup I can one hit kill anyone even in PA. Commando, Ground Pounder, Tank Killer, Frog Legs, Adrenaline (may not work in NW, haven’t tested yet) Lifegiver and Bloody Mess.
---
I typically use a handmade or combat rifle.
---
I hear this all the time but have never had a problem (except with bows) what platform are you on. I'm wonder if its different for different platforms
---
I have them and I have PMd you my psn.
---
Yeah thinking the same thing myself. It does say "45 minutes" remaining, i think ima try it.
---
That... would be not funny...
---
I still see the old ones, but this one is a new.
---
Oof that's the worst one in the thread.
---
Yeah I got it as well but I’m scared to complete it. Dont wanna bug out
---
I have had the plans for a very long time and haven’t had a crappy one drop as a legendary. I traded up to get mine.
---
Challenges for Atoms or now the grind for atom shop cosmetics being the primary focus of gameplay is what I have a problem is. Legendary Run was a good rework of the challenges in my opinion but we need some real game play additions. 
---
They are taking advantage of this wonderful intellectual property to create an online world that they can sell us clothes in. Its embarrassing.
---
You don't have to break the crossbow to repair it. Just use it enough to bring the durability down a little and you can fix it again. Went really fast at the penitentiary with the weapons bench and nearby ghouls, just bash em a couple times (does quite a bit of durability damage) and repair.
---
This could easily be avoided by making keys work the same way as the new Gauss Weapons or the SService Armor. Dropping those destroys them.
---
I haven't missed any challenges yet thankfully and get the bonus 3-4 times a day I'm just shy of lvl 21 with an hour to go so might squeeze in another bonus
---
Yeah ive been killing a lot of the L30-52 Robots at Dyer chem these last couple days and have not been getting fusion cores from the brains so it must have been nerfed.
---
Yes! I started to freak out till I saw your post lol. Thought everything auto completed. The reset is normaly on the next hour? I wouldn't do it. I don't think I even want to play till the next reset lol.
---
I agree 100%.
---
Took me a couple weeks playing to realise I can break down junk at benches. Was stashing all the items without breaking them down.
---
Right when you choose to play NW, on PS4 you hit square to toggle it on and off
---
I think it's just really poorly worded, technically you're aiming if the weapon is out lol
---
In PA you can survive underwater until you run out of oxygen, because it's sealed off from the environment, but you get rad worms the instant a feral notices you miles off.
---
Players: "it would be cool to get centaurs back in the game, or maybe have an ant queen show up again, all there radants have to be coming from somewhere"
---
Bethesda: "we have heard the community, swarms of cazadors have flooded Appalachia"
---
I just logged in I see them, gonna quickly do it and log out before the reset in 40 minutes
---
Actualy pre 25 set up a CAMP near Gaully mine that is roughly beteen the mine entrance and exit, but up the hill. There’s a acid vent you can place a acid extractor at, for lead use weight room ar that motel in Flatwoods and the weight room in the fire station for lead
---
Just a question, as I usually put the cards on, but where do you see your experience goes up in your status?  Maybe I missed it in the status tab, but I don’t see the +15 as you do with other buffs, though it does seem to go up faster?
---
"I don't like this thing and I don't care if others do, my opinion is more absolute."
---
an xp buff for atoms...seems like the mobile game strategy so probably
---
Yea but that way it'll go nicely with almost any outfit or armor set 
---
I do agree, at least some chrome accents or something to mix up the black matte would be nice
---
i did this last night, i claimed one workshop, built the numbers of items it said it needed and i got the points.
---
Again, i did not claim FIVE different workshops, i claimed one workshop and then built all the stuff it said to build under the weekly tab.  Glitch?  IDC bc it hadnt counted the 7 dailies I did.
---
Thorn armor sets are what my friends swear by.
---
A lot of people don't seem to realize this, but buying plans from vendors puts caps back into their pool. So if you've drained the vendors you can buy a couple of plans and keep selling off stuff if you need to make some inventory space for yourself.
---
I've just logged off now and haven't completed it. Hopefully it doesn't bug out. I'm presuming it glitched and showed one of the challenges early.
---
I use gunsmith all the time, super useful. Rarely have to repair my guns since I use the park to repair them to 200% as well.
---
!remindme 1hr
---
If they’re playing fo76 at this point, it’s pretty obvious they have mental illnesses. 
---
Pretty much what I’d expect.
---
This isn't even that far on the rewards list lol, I'm probably gonna earn it later today when the dailies and weeklies reset, and I've barely been playing anything other than NW
---
I would up vote this 100 times if I could.
---
It feels like you can get diseases just from mobs looking at you. The one single resource I'm always out of is disease cures and antibiotics, going to WS just to get rid of them is getting really tiresome. I really like the mechanic in general, it's just ridiculously easy too get them as it is now that I'm constantly running around with diseases
---
Double score, afaik, is only for dailies.
---
Double score is only for dailies I believe. At least that is what the community calendar seems to imply.
---
I believe it’s 15 minutes
---
Thanks for that 
---
I'm Full Health not bloodied
---
The reason I asked about Secret Service, is that on fallout fandom it doesn't list weightless as a possible mod for the Secret Service Armour. But they sometimes get it wrong so I thought I'd ask here as it seems so popular
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service_armor
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure that's how I learned mine
---
It doesn't show up it the status. I've never really noticed that, honestly.
---
Shall I send videos of my level 0 default builds kicking ass as well? Again, excuses. The only way anyone will ever improve is if they stop finding reasons to avoid self-improvement. If you think someone else's PERK CARDS are kicking your ass, figure out how to outsmart little pieces of fictional trading cards.
---
It's true. I thought they resetted an hour earlier and i was screwed,but then it means it's just a last second new challenge.....gogogo
---
That is what I have at the moment. I have a full set but I have only managed to get two pieces with the Weightless Modifier
---
Damn :/ kinda expected more. 
---
I wish they didn’t add an extra 25 xp per level - hopefully they’ll throw that out next season.
---
I'll try to complete it and see what happens.
---
Yep. Inventory management game ;-)
---
I drop a ton of gear and aid now, right on the ground.
---
Thanks, my dude.
---
My perk cards make a hell of a lot of difference. But yeah, a level 0 can kill a level 100000 with a fully optimised build. I’ve done in a level 140 with a level 1 character.
---
Ah, I see you are correct! Very nice.
---
Yup, "[Image](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg)" - High S.C.O.R.E. Weekend - Double Dailies :)
---
you have any good locations to farm optic fiber? they are a bitch to find
---
I don't think people would be that annoyed with the hunger/thirst mechanic if cooking wasn't such a tedious task.
---
Get dirty water, meat, wood, veggies, whatever. Slap on Super Duper and go to town at the cooking station. Watch the server choke as you cook dozens of whatever because coding a quantity slider is, apparently, an impossible task.
---
It's even worse with Speed Demon because that mutation turns you into something that eats the oil consumption of a small country in a single day.
---
I was thinking fortnite but gta v also works
---
right? no one would survive the shit talk from those lobbies these days
---
Yeah I think they should nerf the country bonus if the sell them, but no one would buy them...lol
---
From other games i've played with a battlepass/season, it rewards you for doing the high-level activities that you would be doing normally. So you could take it at your leisure, if you wanted to go incredibly hard grinding at the start to frontload your progress and then sort of take it easy later on, you could. If you were taking a break and wanted to grind like a madman to catch up later on in the season you could.
---
I think the thing that turns a lot of people off about F76's season is that there's not really any endgame activities to speak of so instead they just adopted the arbitrary tasks of daily/weekly atom challenges. There's nothing new or exciting about it and if you miss a single day of this you're in for hours of grinding to catch up. Stale daily challenges for 10 weeks straight is personally not my definition of fun. I don't think people would be half as aggravated with the whole situation if they at least followed through on public events giving S.C.O.R.E
---
A good spot for lead is the shack in the middle of the dried up lake between New Ghad and Summersville. They have two tin can chimes that get me 18 lead total and occasionally two rat poisons next to the bar counter. I got my camp right there and hit up those can chimes every time I log on. There’s also a steel ore vein as well if anyone is looking to set camp there. Plus if you run workshops, the lake cabins nearby have a lead vein.
---
it's just a game and yet 'they' take it way too far.  
---
Twitch and other avenues try and making gaming some thing that is essential to humanity's progression. It isn't.  
---
Most people like to escape real life for a brief time through many ways. Hiding behind a keyboard to insult and threaten others is simply cowardly. 76 is the only MMO (limited) I play and until Seasons was only solo. Every group I've been in since has been good.
---
You can buy it from the white springs bunker
---
Yes its definitely a bug  if they absolutly didnt want us using them they would just made them blueprints. Like the Easter bunny hat.my guass ss shotgun skin doesnt work in nw but the camo one does.
---
I logged on and did it and got 10k score.
---
I have it too, and you’re not crazy, well, on this issue.
---
Remember the daily and weekly cycle went back an hour.  My guess is this is another glitch about that.  I’m honestly not sure what to do, go for the 1000 score, or risk losing another 5000 because that screws It up...
---
In fact think I’m going to pass, good luck on not having this screwed up for you, after losing 1750 score to bugs I’m not taking any more chances!
---
If Bethesda adds a key ring to the game, they will also add a mechanic where everytime you use a key you have to individually select the correct key from the mass of unlabeled keys on the ring. And they will forget to limit the key to one copy so you can carry duplicates.
---
Ammoconverter flashbacks anyone?
---
To be fair, the magic effect on shotguns has a falloff range. You must hit with all pellets or at least most pellets for the M.A.G.I.C to occur. I do believe it is tied somehow to the ROF bug with heavy 200+ ROF guns. If you are too far away and too many of your pellets dont connect, you dont get the murder hit.
---
Meaning, you have to be relatively close. And as stated, you must also be using vats.
---
Also, on "Boss" mobs like Scorchbeasts and Mirelurk Queens that have huge health pools, you wont be oneshotting them. For my stealth shotgunner, it still takes 5-7 full on hits IF I am close enough to get the full load of pellets to connect. Which means magic shotties arent all that great for Scorchbeasts in general unless you can get them to ground long enough to unload a full AP bar worth of Vats hits on them.
---
The name of the event on the community calendar is "High SCORE Weekend Double Dailies", and I think a rep stated that it would only be for the daily challenges. Pretty sure it doesn't include weeklies because so far the weekly challenges have been relatively easy to complete without realizing, and they new it would be problematic for people to hold off on those challenges.
---
This. This right here.
---
It's obviously a broken or ignored component of PA. Where exactly are these critters hitting me that has such a direct line to my immune system?  Like your whole body is covered in state of the art technology, except your kidneys.  That's just duct tape and silver spray paint.  Oh, and the mirelurks can sense it.
---
As a side note, snot ear is a thing.  Of all the diseases in the game that one makes me grimace. Not that rad worms sounds like a treat or anything....but, snot ear...bleh.
---
Some gun skins arent working aswell like my ss guass shotgun skin also doesnt work in nw. But my camo guass shotgun one does.
---
Yea it's been asked for since game came out and it is on the roadmap.  Look for perk loadouts.
---
yeah well I completed it so will let you know!! Think I should just log out now to be honest!!
---
For me, it gave 1k.
---
Perk cards only enhance what is already there. But by damn, if I need to get a squad wipe with an unperked weapon, I'm gonna make the minor adjustments needed to use that weapon... And I'm gonna get it done.
---
"Rash B, cyka blyat!"
---
Wierd as dieing means very little in the game and at lvl 236 he should be able to easily farm back any junk he lost.
---
This is a weekly, for 1k score.
---
There is no reason possible to give a death threat over damn near anything online.
---
Well we could still be screwed lol! I've completed mine but someone else suggested it might be better not to unless you lose the whole lot!
---
I know. I did it last night in five minutes. with the above instructions. Lol.
---
I hate switching out cards just to open a safe, gather materials, or craft/repair anything. My main is 59 and I maxed out Weapon Artisan. I also have max Ammosmith. I've forgotten enough times that switching is annoying.    
---
Since you can rename your gear you could rename your Perk loadout:    
---
Solo    
---
Group    
---
Resource    
---
Crafting/Repair    
---
Camp Building
---
Hmm yea usually the military camps have a lot of ammo pouches that give ballistic fiber when you scrap them 
---
They can be found pretty commonly at Camp Venture if you can get into the brotherhood of steel bunker (gotta do the brotherhood of steel questline which starts at Abbie's Bunker Northeast in The Mire, reading all the notes in Abbie's terminal inside that bunker procs the quest 
---
actually that whole questline takes you to locations where you can find alot of ballistic fiber spawns, since brotherhood of steel have so many of those ammo pouches lying around
---
Other than that, check out all the military sites around the cranberry bog, usually can find them in the tents
---
Edit - oh fuck optic fiber? I'm sorry lmao I just read fiber and assumed you meant ballistic fiber, lemme see, I don't even remember ever needing optic fiber for anything so I must have a lot of it
---
Imma try as well... may only need to get 3 like the others...
---
I got 10k score for completing it. It might be a bug but sure is handy.
---
Apex legends has a scaling system for their pass, but the scaling resets each week. On top of that, a lot of battle passes like this that have weekly challenges to complete actually preserve the weekly challenges until the end of the season instead of nuking them each week, completed or not. I think BGS has weighted this season too heavily towards the heavily committed and needs to relax it juat a hair.
---
I can't think of a single way you wouldn't interpret that statement the way you have
---
Yeah I've become unemployed thanks to the coronavirus. I used to be happy to spend a few pounds to bump up my current atoms to buy something nice but I'm really not now going to spend serious money on "stuff" in the atom shop
---
I had two guys try to 2 v 1 me at my workshop a few months ago. They both came in with quad gamma guns and Tesla rifles. I killed them about 10 times each with my QE laser before they gave up and began sending me threats. Its honestly pathetic at how toxic some PvPers are. If you lose, you lose. No need to be a dickhead.
---
Jesus christ dude. Are you afraid of your own shadow?
---
Mute the fucking guy, block them and report them problem solved.
---
Avoiding something in it's entirety on an off-chance you may encounter it is honestly sad.
---
Posts like this are just as bad as the guy in question.
---
I play PvE and PvP games. Some people play for competition, others play to relax. Every game/play styles is okay.
---
You not agreeing with it, is okay. That is ENTIRELY what individuality is about. 
---
Smack talking in competitive professional environments be it sports, gaming etc all happens.
---
But i've never once in my lifetime (30 years old now who lives with Anxiety btw) genuinely do not care what someone says to me online.
---
It's the fucking internet, it does NOT in anyway effect me IRL, they will never find me unless i tell them where i am.
---
Ignore them.
---
There’s about a five minute timer, for you to re-enter the world. If you don’t re-enter the world the nonF1 player will receive a 20 minute timer.
---
4 days x 2000 extra score = 8000 not too bad. The double xp weekend will be huge also
---
Weightless is not a mod but a legendary effect. And AFAIK there are no restrictions on the legendary effects that Secret Service armor can drop with.
---
A long time ago, that's actually how it used to work.  It was a straight-up movement speed bonus as long as you had the gun out.
---
Hasn't been like that for probably a year, though.
---
Score!
---
This has made me smile
---
We definitely have the best community because I’ve had stuff like this happen to me 
---
Had some level 60 drop me a gauss rifle once and a bunch of other weapons and shit
---
It was great
---
The interface is horrible. You should have:    
---
Deposit ammo for points: 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000    
---
Buy ammo for X ammo with varying costs at the same numbers.    
---
The ROI for for ammo SUCKS as well as cost for buying.
---
I was so annoyed I couldn't use the scout paint on my solar armor. 
---
I like the effect, but god damn I kinda hate the vineyard look
---
oh I meant optics fiber, not ballistic fiber. the one you use to craft plasma guns
---
Personally, I'd like a few new crafing benches... Legendary Weapons Bench, Legendary Armor Bench, Legendary Power Armor Stattion… and all the build options could be done on these, but with an additional cost of modules. Thus, anything you make on them *must* use modules but is always a Legendary, while things you make on the normal benches never take modules and are never legendary.
---
This gives you the option of making normal stuff or special stuff, and you're off and running.
---
Yeah I've opted to not do it either. Rather not chance it and wait til later to do the weeklies.
---
I only completed 2 and it finished it
---
Agree some of those negatives need some developer attention, but personally, I’m really enjoying the T-65. With a medic pump, calibrated shocks, batteries included, and max stabilized, I’m doing all right. Recently, the game has been throwing a lot of cores my way, so that hasn’t been a worry. My biggest downside is having to exit PA to cook and craft, but that’s a minor complaint. All that said, I think build is a key factor. If I weren’t running a high health heavy gunner, I’d probably have a dimmer view of PA in general.
---
You can put a password on your profile, so every time it will prompt for the password before signing in. Then create a guest or 2nd profile for your brother.
---
This first season is working out to be one of those situations where, on paper, the math all checks out, but in practice people might get so burnt out they may not get far.
---
&gt;Leather armor is currently the only armor on which the Shadowed mod (harder to detect in dark places) works.
---
Has anyone tested this since update 20? There was a line in the patch notes for it about shadowed mods now being available for all armors, but they were *already* available, so there's a question of: what did they actually change? Did they maybe fix the stealth effect so it works correctly on all armors? Or is it still exclusive to just the leather armor?
---
I went back to GTA. After the weirdness of people in the Fallout universe, GTA was a welcome breath of fresh air. I've actually played both franchises since, well they're about my favorite things. It sucks having to step back from 76, especially when I bought it a year and a half after release for super cheap. All the failures of this title release didn't even bother me. It's the players I ended up having to avoid.
---
Thats what i did. Run the like the wind take 5 empty workshops over and log out. Hopefully it doesn’t screw anything up but if so then thats on Bethesda to make it right.
---
I have it too and done it in a hurry.
---
Hopefully it wont bug out after the reset.
---
People also liked the idea. PvP in this game is fine in idea, the balance of items is the issue.
---
First month of release was the best for PvP.
---
Let's just say I will be kicking and muting a lot of people as the scream at me wanting to trade for a "godroll" gun
---
I have the same setup and get 45-60 fps. Thought it might be my internet connection which isn't the greatest because private servers run so much better for me, no frame drops at all.
---
I feel like the gauss rifle needs quite a bit of rework.  It's a damage powerhouse when it hits but it's completely broken in VATS and has been since launch, you can be point blank on a stationary target w/o VATS and still miss somehow (server lag maybe?), and half the time when you do a full charge instead of firing it just powers down somehow...that's not even an option!!
---
I got the first pain for Seasons last night.    
---
I'm sure others are far ahead of me. I haven't used PA often.
---
You get credit as soon as you claim it. You dont need to stick around and defend it!
---
i noticed a weird thing with the behemoth that if you loot before it hits the ground, the inventory gets scrambled and different stuff appears in the inventory
---
I do athletics, archer and codebreaker. Never swimmer as you rarely see any die in water. 
---
Athletics is pretty easy, pretty much just need to run the courses.
---
Archer is also easy. Make one at the range, complete the target practice, make the required 40 bolts (I do 80, plus you'll recover some so there plenty of leeway) and then head off south for ghoul killing. Pretty much everything in the area is one or 2 shot even at low level particularly if you use stealthy headshots. You only need to reduce the durability a small amount not the full 100% so if you use it for bashing as well it'll soon wear down. If you still need to fix then they do show up occasionally in the wild.
---
Codebreaker is easier than it first seems. You'll likely be hacking 1* and 2* terminals in the game anyway, and if still searching for 3* then the very first one you encounter in a Silo will work. If you wait until you have the Chinese Stealth Suit then running the silos so much easier than fighting your way through. Launching the nuke will complete both the values and tasks simultaneously.
---
I have a friend (Hates  me with a passion) like this. I avoid him as best I can nowadays as I don’t want to be torn limb from limb
---
Chest piece is combat armor.
---
Im on Xbox, right on the D-pad is the dedicated stim button lol
---
I've had Fireproof stop working randomly, too. The only pattern I've observed is it seems to be exclusively exploding robots it stops working on, and even then it's not common or consistent for me. I have also been guilty of forgetting to swap it back on, but I've also died multiple times and confirmed it was on after rezzing. Makes me wish I had a Dense Jetpack mod.
---
Yeah I am logged out -- what time is safe to log back in? 10 minutes after reset? Longer?
---
Well I got the 1k score from completing it, let's see if I get screwed over on the reset.
---
Should’ve nuked his camp
---
Yes -- I did it and have logged the f out... not sure if it was the right move...
---
That's such a near idea. I took ages moving and building my new camp the other day, I'd hoped it would be my "forever home" til lying in bed one night whilst beckett was getting drunk by the lake and wondered what all the glowing lights were.
---
So turns out I'm a bit too close to the event line in the sabd,  so every hour I get scorchbeasts reeeing and lots of thugs with guns rocking up..
---
Looks like light combat armor chest and I believe that's is the starlet sniper outfit
---
As for the pants I think those are raider under armour.  Either from the atomic shop or the one in game.
---
is there a certain paint needed to get the 'star' symbol ?
---
Yea I edited my post when I realized you meant fiber optics my bad lol
---
Hmmmmmmmm
---
I'm pretty sure Vault Tec University has a ton of microscopes that contain it, as well as other scientific devices that probably contain it, I'm not sure what all junk has it, but I know microscopes and biometric scanners do, and those can be found there in abundance usually
---
You may have to have the questline to be able to explore the entire vault replica inside the college, but there should be plenty in the college itself 
---
Also the enclave bunker may have some 
---
There is one microscope in the shack that you turn in the daily quest that involves tracking down a cryptid
---
Road leathers for the underarmor but only female characters and I think thats the study combat armor chest
---
I got it, I guess we will find out in 25 minutes whether or not if its going to screw me.
---
Yup, guys like you, with that energy. 
---
Remember, you're still online son lmao. 
---
Like you really must have read that wrong lmao. My guy went far in another direction... It's like you guys come online feeling tough and looking for argument. Yes I'm anti that. I can read thru the comment and it isn't me you're mad at lol. 
---
Wtf though really like you knew something was coming back lmao. Still wondering who you think I am.
---
EDIT Fuck it. Let's play spelling bee. 
---
NOT AFRAID. A-N-N-O-Y-E-D. Now go finish growing up. 30 isn't there yet.
---
Also for future reference, DON'T try picking the lock of anything at a players camp. Doing so makes you "Wanted" which gives a notification to all players, marks you on their map with a big red "wanted" sign, and makes you available to be killed by other players.
---
Since theres a challenge to kill wanted players, becoming wanted at low level will simply result in a lv200 turning up to kill you.
---
Exactly. Just to be safe i toped 10k. If those 300xp are lost -&gt; don’t mind, if they roll over -&gt; perfect!
---
Probably be fine I think it will just show you have completed that one after reset.
---
That's just bizarre! Mine gave me 1000.
---
I don't think there a paint. I think that how it originally look when first crafted. It the light combat armor chest piece.
---
I've definitely done it before too. There really is no way unless you google every single item you get. That's a pain in the butt.
---
Thank's for the heads up and extra 1000 score, got it done and logged out switched off PS4 before the reset.
---

---
Looks like I am wrong about the outfit
---
That no one lined up behind the power armor and started marching breaks my heart.
---
WHERE'S YOUR FASNACHT SPIRIT, PEOPLE?!
---
I do 5 after reset personally.
---
They'll probably swap the repeatable to the event based one at that time just to ruin everyone's time.
---
The early Wastelanders questline will get you one. It can be crafted again every 10 levels up to 50. As far as I've seen there are no mods for this one other than skins from the Atom shop.    
---
The one from the Pioneer Scout questline I haven't finished yet. For that one, there are special vendor boxes that you need Badges as currency. I'm sure there's a guide and a list but avoid it if you don't want spoilers.
---
The worst is when your wearing power armor and level 3 vaccinated and STILL get diseases all the time like come on 90% immune plus power armor should pretty much make me 100% immune to disease right ? Nope
---
no if they do this then a new server crashing god mode glitch will come out and if you sprint fast enough and while in real life noodles cooking in your mouth with boiled water you can get 27 diamond chest pieces from minecraft and also shrek will show up at 3 a.m. eastern standard time but only if you shoot the scorchbeast queen with a fat man
---
All charge weapons will miss in vats at 95% because it also has to be fixed (long standing bug)
---
Finally, came here looking for this response. Like, who cares if they got butthurt and said they wanted to kill you. They literally won't be able to find who you are IRL. Just move on.
---
I read the other repeatable is for completing public events. My question is how much SCORE will it reward. If it’s 100 still it’s going to slow down progress potentially.
---
Narrator:  Bethesda, however, does nothing.
---
Yup. The most I've been is slightly annoyed when I accidentally hit someone right after a queen fight and then they unload on me. But that's what I get for not running pacifist. If you've got a wanted tag, you're fair game, even if it was accidental.
---
this mod can do it
---

---
I think rat poison also has 5 lead in each box.
---
I thought that was from INT? I run both high so cant tell for sure.
---
It's one of the guaranteed rewards in the game I think (chest) -- last bastion.
---
When on the mode select screen (Adventure, Private, NW) highlight NW and press R to toggle autofill team.
---
There's a small note at the bottom of the screen showing what it's set to.
---
I'd say Archer, Athlete and whatever the one is that has you take pictures of mirelurks and frogs. Since they have fixed the spawn of critters after Fasnacht it's mega easy to find a frog. Go east of Hemlock Holes between there and Wavy Willard's and spam vats as you're looking around, always find them there. Once you've captured one and made the frog jar at your camp the pictures are mega easy. You can just look up online what spawns where, fast travel, snap a pic and you're done. Don't do swimmer, you'll have problems finding someone to revive in water unless you post and look for help.
---
I'm disappointed to not actually see you use the tent item ;)
---
Indeed.
---
That's what i meant. I made one and it had like 180% condition or something. And then i was like 'oops' it was only after it took like 30 minutes to break it enough that i could repair i looked online and saw you could find one.
---
Guys like me? With that energy? 
---
What energy? The ability to think logically? The ability to separate gaming from real life?
---
The ability to not care what someone says?
---
That comment literally makes no sense.
---
Mad? I'm not mad. I'm shocked people are sad enough they use the internet in fear due to stupidity.
---
You guys? I'm not a shit talker lmfao.
---
You're Waaaay wide of any mark with that paranoia.
---
Dude. You play GTA. Don't talk to me about growing up.
---
WoW had/has a mail system. There are mailboxes almost everywhere and Auction houses in the big cities. When I played years ago, you could send gold/limited # of items to any character as long as you knew that character's name.    
---
I would do as you are thinking in sending my other two alternate char things.
---
Thats is light combat armour chestpiece and old leathers.
---
You can bash an enemy once with the weapon and then repair it. That's what I did anyway. Bashing an enemy takes the durability down a slight notch from full.
---
For those level challenges, it’s easier to go into a low level alt since the levels come faster
---
Nice! I was looking for it AFTER I was already loaded into the lobby. Thank you so much!!
---
Just gave away about 70 plans to free up vendor space =0
---
But think of those 40 atoms you got for acquiring different diseases!
---
Did you file any sort of ticket for it?
---
idk, you can server hop for public events to appear, might be faster. And I would save lots of ammunition. Grinding mutants wastes a fair amount of ammo for me.
---
It's pretty mind boggling that calling out someone like this by name isn't allowed. Sometimes rules just get in the way. Even worse to see you getting praised for not doing it, rather than them making an exception. And in a sticky comment no less! Now no one will know if they're dealing with this unhinged person or not.
---
The thought hurts my soul
---
Awwww darn
---
Ra-Ra is, and I can not stress this enough, my least favourite character in *any* fallout game.
---
That’s true but I thought the SCORE stuff was locked to whatever character you use?
---
Should’ve minded your own business you cheap asshole
---
I think FO3 and FNV were the only ones.
---
I got the Formula P recipe, again. The annoying thing about it, it's the same character who already knows it. I'll probably transfer it to my other character.
---
I wonder if it will be replaced after refresh or stay put and be completed.
---
omg, why am I not using super duper when I craft ammo...
---
Good call.
---
Ive resorted to rolling a new Character to complete that challenge for the Legendary Run. At level 310 its takes so much XP to reach that next level.
---
To correct myself. There a mod slot which is Fibreglass. It give you a black star. However the one in there must be a armor you get from the story line.
---
Concentrated Fire: You’ll have a 95% chance to hit and then miss every bullet in the damn mag three times in a row. Apparently this is much worse on the new gauss weapons, I’ve heard people say the pistol literally misses the first shot in vats always, even at 95%.
---
Escape Artist: Straight up does not work at times. Heard other players say it’s so bugged out that it actually gets you caught more often somehow.
---
Sneak: Enemies will randomly notice me instantly like I have no sneak perks at all. Examples of this would be going to the whitesprings parking lot at night, shooting a ghoul with a silenced rifle while sneaking, and then I go straight from hidden to danger, don’t even see caution.
---
Bloody Mess: Since Wastelanders dropped, anything you bloody mess gets blown to bits, but when you look at the body the whole body appears beside the first body still in pieces. (Also might not be a bug, but I don’t care for it either way. Used to be the bloody mess effect happened when shooting stuff in the torso only, Since wastelanders dropped the bloody mess effect happens no matter what where you shoot enemies now, foot head arm, whatever. The bloody mess effect also happens way too often now. Was cool at first, but when you fight 10 ghouls and 7 of them explode into pieces in tall grass, it’s really goddamn annoying. I just removed bloody mess altogether because of these issues.)
---
Cannibal: The amount of food meter restored when eating a body doesn’t increase with more ranks of the perk. Rank 1 cannibal restores just as much food as rank 3. The carnivore mutation also doesn’t increase the amount of food you get from eating one body. (Probably oversights rather than bugs, but still. It’s very annoying. No point in getting cannibal past rank 1.)
---
Home Defense: (I think that’s the name? The perk that lets you make missile turrets.) Sometimes when equipping the perk it still won’t let me build missile turrets until a relog.
---
Mysterious Savior: Arsehole literally never shows up. Have this perk at max and I’ll go literal entire play sessions without being revived once by him. Or when he finally does show up, I get downed and then die despite the fact he showed up and stimned me. (Or once in a blue moon when he does revive me, I’ll be in the get up animation and before the animation finishes the enemies will shoot/hit me again downing me instantly before I even exit the revive animation.)
---
Super Duper: When it procs for making ammo with ammo smith, it doesn’t give you as much ammo as it should. Say making one type of ammo gives you 10 bullets, and ammo smith makes that 20 bullets. If super duper procs then, you’ll get 30 bullets instead of 40.
---
Public Teams. If you're the leader leave it on Building for the Intelligence bonus so everything you do gives you more XP. When you're about to finish Events, swap to Events as your team goal for the bonus. Also, throw the Inspirational Perk on under Charisma.
---
Thanks for this.
---
Not at all.  Would much rather not have had to deal with them.
---
I don't understand how that's your goal but I respect the hell out of the commitment 
---
Go get that monkey
---
Light shadowed combat armor chest and road leathers undearmor
---
Nope it will transfer to all characters meaning you can get score and the rewards for both except for I believe consumables and the currencies
---
Seconds after stepping out of the vault for the first time on my first char, some L415 runs up to me, sticks a machine gun in my face and circle strafes around me until the mag is empty. Then they threw half a dozen bottle cap mines at my feet, stuck the barrel in my face again, spazzed out uncontrollably for several seconds, then bunny hopped away, pausing only to mini-nuke the nearby corpse of the woman that has the pipe gun.
---
I just sat there thinking to myself "The fuck just happened?" while watching this maniac fade into the distance.
---
Arturo in Diamond City sells a fat man named Little Boy in Fallout 4. Think it's a MIRV modded one but can't remember exactly.
---
On a side note, how does one buy season levels? I keep hearing about it but theres no option for it in game from what I see
---
Really I want a system to transfer ítem untradeables beetween your characters
---
the cranberry cobbler stacks so just turn on green thumb and get like a million cobbler and munch away
---
There also a paint in (or was in) the atomic shop. Call blood wash paint. Basically the same thing as the armor in that picture however it cover in blood. Idk if it still in the atomic shop
---
Idk I would feel weird about wielding something called a little boy lol
---
well my idea is cool than arturo could ever be
---
Wow I didn’t know this. So I could jump on an alt to complete that challenge and it would go to the overall SCORE for all characters?  So everybody shares only one game board?
---
&gt;God forbid a company try to earn some money.... 
---
Because this company is doing it in a way that comes off as scummy. There are lots of games that have MTX that does it right by just having them as cosmetics:
---
- Overwatch
---
- Monster Hunter World
---
- Apex Legends
---
- Fortnite
---
- Resident Evil 1R, 0R, 2R.
---
Just to name a few.
---
Then games that do have paid MTX are basically Expansion packs or new characters in fighting games that give you a ton of new fresh gameplay experience. Fo76's Scrap Box, Fridge, Ammo Converter, and Scrap Bot are not new fresh gameplay experiences.
---
So why cant Fo76 make money in a way that is not scummy?
---
Fallout 76 being priced and released like a AAA title does not feel, play, and behave like a AAA title. 
---
Now its more like a Free-mium game, but my god most free-mium games are better polished than this one. This one is a laggy and buggy game, and thats sad because I like Fallout and I want it to be better.
---
thanks for the heads up!
---
well id also feel weird wielding a fat man
---
I was level 56 about a year ago. And I decided to set my camp down in the mire and did all the daily’s and end up getting all the rare outfits before I got to level 100.
---
a lot of player vendors sell plans for 10-25 caps i've found. or sometimes even less.
---
I'll be on a bit after 12, I'll message you.
---
Gamertag jonathanenglish
---
No atom shop in the PTS.
---
it's a 1000 thank you
---
Actually I think it’s called Big Boy
---
Ha for reals?  Is that intentional or something that’s a current glitch?
---
This is a really clever build!  That foundation makes it so versatile!  I like that you actually stylized it and made it look mobile.  It's not just a giant box on a tiny foundation.  This looks like it could detach and hover.
---
I like it!
---
Does keeping all three animals alive matter?
---
Me and my buddy duo Paradise any time we see it. We just max one habitat, keep one alive, and I figured it was max reward. I've gotten formula, diffuser, lab coat, bear arm
---
INT is for crafted weapons and armor, and junk from scrapping. At least according to the wiki
---
If you don’t want to make a new character you can eat canned meat stew take a nap and use leader bobble heads and when the event path to enlightenment pops up do that each one of those gives you plus 5% and then join a public team for events
---
Thank you all for the info ... I will pop into the game and try your ideas &lt;3
---
Public events are on a timer. You can’t trigger them anymore.
---
i think its an actual thing for now
---
Nice callback to the "Hitman" Hart
---
For me its the floaters. Kill them, grab all their stuff and run away before they explode
---
Me too :(
---
Only if it was a little tiny pistol like the Noisy Cricket from MiB.
---
Explosives are crappy but I had loads of fun with a recent daily to kill stuff with a Fat Man. Also I enjoyed the grenade launcher whilst doing the glitched Line in the Sand event. Bodies everywhere.
---
What is an ITV
---
 Little boy is the name of the real mini nuke launcher that was developed during the cold war.. needless to say,  it was never used. 
---
I think.. or it was the one dropped on Nagasaki.  Can't remember.
---
Why not just ignore the person instead of trying to ruin their gaming experience because they got mad?
---
That was nice of him, but be slightly cautious in picking up stuff that seems a bit crazy. Presents are a sort of dark currency that works in the game, because they were MASSIVELY duplicated before the fix; No harm on your back, you can pick up and use whatever you want, but a small caution to the fact the presents can give you items which normally would take a bit of grinding and playing to allocate. Part of the fun of 76 is finding this stuff, and having loads of the power armour plans and weapon plans and what not can damage the luster of when you pick them up naturally; But, it’s a nice head start when heading into the game, and he obviously did it out the desire to help you, like someone smuggling a key to you in prison inside a cake, which is inside an even bigger cake.
---
Different times on different servers though.
---
not if it has 180% condition from making one. Which it did D:
---
Really I dont know others online ganes, this Is the unique I played, maybe because I am fan Since the fallout 1
---
yea i know so was the fat man
---
True I suppose.
---
Inside the Vault on Bethesda's site. They release one every Thursday. They discuss updates, events, future content.
---
Wait, they do wear off? So there's literally no downside to that mutation!? I know what I'm shopping for today.
---
Stuff like Bullion, Caps, Lunchboxes are but plans are account wide. Also you can just wait to claim the reward until you are back onto your Main character.
---
thats not a bad idea lol
---
If you're running carnivore to get that bonus from squirrel stew you also want some scorchbeast brains to give your int a big boost.
---
Or some how I missed it. Just finished and it rewarded the 1k.
---
Guess we'll find out soon
---
I’ve yet to dip into the public teams as I spend most of my time on private world unless theres a big event going on. Mostly because I have limited time to play some days due to work/kids and just want to get stuff done. Totally on me though.
---
Do you log out to main menu or quit the game entirely?
---
Is it a link I need to search for
---
The game within the game.
---
It's one of the raider under armors.
---
Yeah in that case that sucks. Bound to find this quest fairly early on, at least I did, so crafting anything was standard durability.
---
Is your gauss rifle still doing explosive damage? My non-legacy gauss isn't.
---
Still enough time to do it, go go go ;)
---
Lol derrr didn’t even think of that.
---
I've completed it to make up for the score I lost a couple days ago, logged out now and we'll see what happens.
---
found it! at the armory!
---
For the score I didn't have to build anything just claim the workshop, rinse and repeat.
---
I already completed the rest of the weeklies.
---
Should Bethesda focus on removing bugs, and glitches instead of changing events players take part in.
---
No, it is horrible behavior. I did an event earlier and saw a guy just standing on the edge while another player and I were shooting everything. I aimed my minigun at him to let him know I knew he was there and kept right on going. He finally joined us and killed one mirelurk, but he still gets the XP and rewards.
---
Yes. It's a page on Bethesdas site.
---
I know
---
They are all duplicated items. This sub will cry about duped items but as soon as they are gifted duped items by a player then they have no issue with it. And you’ll love this game if you like building camps. It’s basically camp simulator 76. Everyone that still plays this game only wants to build a cute little base. The new “season” event is nothing but garbage cosmetics. Bethesda hasn’t added any worthwhile gameplay changes so anyone that actually wants to play fallout like it was intended has already left.
---
Will you be on later tonight?
---
Noted.
---
Yeah. Was wondering about that. I finished mine.
---
Yes a lot of people have been creating new characters and deleting them for leveling up and nuclear winter challenges. I believe all cosmetic and camp items you unlock will also be shared with all characters just not the lunchboxes, atoms and stuff like that.
---
Oh God xcom flashbacks lol. But yeah I have some weird vats shots happen.
---
Is the deposit fully within the camp radius?
---
I think this game is designed for people with gambling/addiction issues because there’s never any fun but there’s always the chance fun could happen if you just try one more time....
---
What's the time frame for "before the challenges reset"? Is a couple of hours before safe? I played some NW this morning before work (because I only needed 2 more minutes survival to get S.C.O.R.E.) around 7 AM Pacific; my understanding is that the challenges reset at 9 or 10 AM Pacific, right?
---
Exactly, and Bethesda doesn't care either way you're still spending atoms.
---
Line in the Sand and Surface to Air frequently get filled with XP balloo--I mean enemies. If you're on a Building team, you can *easily* get 3000 XP per spawn at LiS, and StA frequently does this thing where scorchedbeasts respawn as soon as you kill the active one so you can get another XP balloon every few seconds. Direct your teammates to join you and you'll get more spawns.
---
Horde and Enclave events also have virtually unlimited spawns, but usually not in great numbers since people tend not to join them in numbers(and people tend to kill horde leaders instead of kill farming anyways).
---
We know.
---
I shut the game down to make sure.
---
This post answered a question I *just asked* in another post. LOL
---
3 points in inspirational is an extra 15% xp. Also strange in numbers will give extra food buff amounts if you're running a food mutation.
---
Did you check your stored tab to see if there is an extractor in there already?
---
If you don’t enjoy workshop claiming/building/retaining, daily missions, events hopping, or role playing then this game isn’t for you. This game was never intended to be a PVE horde-wave game. There are PVE horde wave events (radiation rumble, scorched earth, virtually all the enclave events) that you can farm if that’s your thing but if that’s all you want to do you are playing the wrong game. This is primarily an online survival game.
---
In terms of outfits it (and the leather coats) are second in rarity to the red Asylum outfit, so you can trade it for pretty much any other piece of rate apparel you want other than that. It won't get you a god roll Fixer or high end legacy, but I've seen people on the market subs offer things like bloodied explosive LMGs and lower tier legacy guns like the BE laser or TSE Gauss rifle.
---
Oh man, they found the "pile of dirt" plans. Super rare.
---
Just my 2 cents:
---
My son and I play casually every couple of weeks. We both bought the pre sale when the came first launched and then quit playing due to the aggressive players and how buggy the format was then. 
---
We came back this year after the changes and have really enjoyed the Adventure mode but still run into players with a bounty who like to harass lower level gamers like us. The GTA references in the comments I read in this post are spot on. 
---
It would be cool if there was a way to limit 200 plus level players from trolling on lower level players in the game.
---
Egghead mutation has been a big help. I team up with my friend and we both have strange with numbers. I believe +9 intelligence. I absolutely notice a difference.
---
This might be my route to go. Thanks appreciate it!
---
Or just capture the munitions factory workshop every time you play and never have to pick up lead scrap ever again. I don't know if it will produce enough ammo for heavy weapons but I've got 5000+ rounds if .45 and 5.56 ammo on me most of the time.
---
I just shut the game down and start from scratch
---
Hahahahahaha this is not an online survival game, this is a very very poor attempt at 'survival'
---
Are you missing a component needed to build it?
---
I can sell you the serum for 350 caps
---
Camp building simulator 76. Bethesda knows they’ve lost their actual RPG fan base. So now they are just catering to the cute little camp builders by releasing a battle pass with nothing but cosmetics. The few people left that actually like playing fallout like it was intended only stick around for the gambling effect of RNG and things like the Purveyor. Salivating at the chance for a god tier weapon but then being let down when they have no enemy worth using it on.
---
I don't have any of the Hacker perks.  
---
I know the tricks and all just find Lockpicking is faster.
---
That's why I usually turn off in-game voice chat at certain events where I know there might be a high chance of running into assholes, even if they're gonna be flaming someone else and not me. I don't use a mic myself and have learned how to work with most of the mechanics to participate in public events without stepping on anyone's kill credits while mostly playing solo otherwise.
---
'give us more content'...have you looked at Season 2 roadmap? BOS returns with new quests. Don't be expecting a new Wastelanders size dlc every month - and I guarantee if there was people would just complain about a hundred other things.
---
IT SHALL BE LOUD NOW! GLORY TO SLAANE- I MEAN FASNACHT!
---
It's not available for a little while, yet.
---
Parasites + speed demon = unfun food mini game
---
I figured it out my camps on a mountain above it and I think it's not encompassed in the range for some reason
---
Well my problem is I’m mostly a solo player since I don’t have the time I’d like to go from event to event in a team.
---
cringe imagine being the nerd that gets angry at a fallout online game that has a million other things to be mad about instead of players playing the game
---
Showed up an hour before the reset
---
I believe it is another week or so before that capability becomes available
---
Hahaha I love it!!
---
Imagine thinking any of that is worth actually getting scared and making an essay about.
---
I’ve noticed that butchers bounty no longer applies to ticks. Not sure if that is intentional though
---
Quests are ok but you need repeatable content that doesn't get boring... many games are capable of this just not fallout
---
Oh yeah. The radius is more like a 3D globe. So if it’s too high or low it won’t register.
---
Is there a recipe for canned meat stew? Or do you just find it?
---
Cheers thought it was fitting people think they are untouchable and it pops a spring when something happens to the opposite
---
I agree. I especially like the fact that the corners look like they unfold.
---
Yes it’s a challenge. That’s ok IMO. I don’t expect to earn everything.
---
Incels be incellin’
---
You can leave it alone and get 3 ranks of weapon artisan instead. Then later if you decide to add a point to the stat gunsmith still be available for you. The best thing is that you only need to equip weapon artisan when repairing weapons.
---
It's not even like shooting things isn't fun there just isn't enough high level enemies on the map, guessing one wasteland will help to fix that quite a bit
---
Because it wouldn't have been allowed out in its current state if it was.
---
Saw the same thing.  I hurried up and did it to make sure I was off my reset today.
---
That would be brutal.
---
Good question. I'm not aware of anyone having done any systematic tests since path 20 dropped. I just assume it's still bugged until someone proves the opposite, because that is, sadly, what I have had to learn to expect from this game.
---
Thanks, cause I'm low on supplies
---
I'm baffled at how many people on this subreddit seem to have never played any other MMO style game before if you think daily limits and currency caps are only found in mobile games.
---
No because they want you to grind for that armor for each character. Also why you can’t trade it. Then no one would log on everyday to grind gold when you could just buy it or trade for it
---
New repeatable content can become just as boring as old repeatable content.
---
Only to the point that you get to buy what you want in the Atomic Shop, whereas the Legendary Run's rewards are all spread out and, for many, aren't that desirable in the first place.  If you're not into the Ghillie suit crap, or the Atomic Onslaught PA, there isn't a whole lot to compensate for the almost total loss of free Atoms.
---
Because otherwise people would have billions of caps/scrip/bullion and it would become useless.
---
you didnt miss it, I had my weeklies at 7/8 for the entire week and then i noticed it at 6/8 this just before, so i ran i did it, got the points and am waiting to see if it fucks up my new weekly challenges.
---
I got 4 out of 5 in the 10 minutes I had after I noticed that. This is fucking stupid
---
they even made it easier by combining all the vendor budgets to the 1400 we have nowadays
---
How do you get those icons?
---
This is why people use the perk loadout mod...
---

---
Managed to finish it and log out before reset, thank you for the heads up.
---
Can confirm weightless SS, I have a partial set.
---
This didn't need a post just stop being soft and use the tools the game provides to counter these things you baby. I would be sobbing from laughter if I made a dude that mad over a dumb game. It's literally empty threats from some video game addict. Grow some nuts pal
---
Just make sure your not in NW when the challenges resets.
---
Facts I mean come on can we get perk load outs before you ask for Twerk emotes ffs
---
This is the first game that has had mutations, right? It would seem only Vault 76'ers can get them and would guess it is probably related to whatever VaulTec was testing. Were they studying a way to turn the best and brightest into "superhumans" to dominate the Wasteland?
---
Very soon, we will see it. Hopes it wont bugs out.
---
I wonder if this has more of an affect than we know and may he why they are removing hunger and thirst peneltys...
---
Ack sorry to hear it. I tried to post right away but was hectic. Didn't search if another thread was started yet to save time but I hadn't seen anything earlier.
---
I agree with you 100%, if i want to farm legendaries all day and scrap them, then let my fucking do it. Nobody like limits in MMORPGs lol.
---
I’ve restarted it four times. Killed all the robots. Then when I ask her to crawl into the vent to open the Power Armor room, once she drops down out of the vent, she freezes in place. Its only an Ultracite helm and there are other places to get one, but it still kinda sucks that I guess I just can’t ask her to open the door.
---
They should open Vault 108 and let Gary's out.
---
How do you get the recipe for squirrel stew? Is it an event drop or do I just have to get lucky?
---
I *kind of* agree - I'm trying to work through the Season, see how far I can get, but I have basically *zero* intention of putting any money into it... I could maybe see buying *a* rank or two, but only if I'm already that close; if I'm ten, twenty ranks off, I'm not spending money on it.
---
That said, I'm probably going to be much more conservative about grabbing stuff from the Atom Shop now. When I could potentially get a couple hundred Atoms in a single week, just from playing the game, I didn't mind just casually spending them on anything that might catch my attention... and if there was something I *really* wanted, but I was just a bit short, I'd maybe even consider throwing a couple dollars in to make up the difference. But now? Once the handful of Atoms I have left are gone, getting anything else from the shop will basically mean needing to spend real money, and, well... I tend to be cheap about these things. (Particularly since "micro" transactions *aren't*, anymore, and not just here - I just can't justify spending $12+ on a single skin or such. It doesn't make sense to me...) So, I won't be grabbing stuff just because I *might* use it, *eventually*... now, any time there's something cool on the shop, I'm going to end up sitting there, asking myself if I'd *really* use it enough to justify the cost... and, chances are, most of the time the answer to that is going to be "no". :/
---
Holotapes and notes as well!
---
Just T-51B
---
I wont grab the pylons if I didnt start it, and if I start it ill grab the. Thats how ive always done it, its annoying when people dont grab the pylons but I wouldnt be a dick about it on open mic
---
But beetween your characters, and ok, only you Can See it in the share stash ir your character have read the plan
---
Just a whiny little wankstain. Their life is sad and pathetic and they probably need help. Glad you handled it so well.
---
Don't use bloodied if you're going full health, use something like instigating or anti-armor.
---
Honestly it would be awesome if everything had the option to craft a random 1-3* legendary version using legendary modules. It's so much nicer to at least be able to specify the weapon/armor piece you want vs. a random selection from all melee/ranged weapons or all armor pieces. I'd gladly have the overall scrip cost be higher if that were the case.
---
Edit: could even make them untradeable like bullion items too
---
Only Raider, Excavator, T45, T51b, T60, T65, X01, Ultracite. No T51.
---
I am.bloodied and I need gunsmith to modify my be handmade, I sacrificed charisma because lone wanderer one level lower is ok and hard bargain 3 don't really need it, after a 20' run on my private server in westek I earn my 1400 daily and still remain with weapons for scrap 😁
---
Only t51 all other a-f were removed but there is a skin for the t51 helmet that increases energy resitance
---
This is what I would have done but I can't help but think it sorta borders on doxxing
---
It’s specifically called T-51b but there’s no physical difference between the b and non-b model, they just got rid of the A-F model system from Fallout 4.
---
Friend...?
---
You can get it as a reward from feed the people event
---
Youre better of going junkies in that case. But IF you are not that worries about damage output you can use bloodied as I Kinda think it was intended. For emergencies
---
I came back to the game after a big gap and didn't even know of the backpack until i saw a few people with backpacks on. And i was like 'wat'
---
and then i did the scout stuff and i was like 115 or something. i hadn't even done the rose stuff on that character either.
---
Solo on a team.
---
You can use a Bloodied weapon if you want, and you will get some damage bonuses from it during fights where you take damage... But if you're going full health you'll probably be better off with an Instigating two handed weapon. They deal high single hit damage, so doubling the damage on that first hit will probably kill most things on the spot.
---
They're toxic because they couldn't take down one person. 😂😂😂 Their pride was badly damaged, I'm sure.
---
Ha now I’m kinda pissed how much time I’ve been spending trying to level up once at level 200. Doh!
---
Junkies is usually the effect people use for Full Health Builds.
---
Much, much more important to fix the broken stuff before adding new broken stuff
---
What is the new outfit?
---
I just pick the new gad lock so duplicate keys arnt an issue for me
---
Exactly! Glad it’s not just me.
---
The more I think about it, the more I'm okay with the concept that I may not get everything, especially since plenty of the utility stuff is earlier in the pass. The ammo converter being only rank 5, whereas the final rank 100 bundle is all cosmetic stuff (some of it even being just reskins of earlier pass items). I just wonder, since a chunk of the playerbase may not get to the end, what's going to happen to those high rank rewards? Will they be gone forever? Will they be added to the atomic shop as a standalone purchase at a later date? Will there be a season "redux"? I guess I just want more clarity on what the intent is here. The entire pass being free as opposed to a free path and premium path makes me have to readjust how I am approaching this.
---
Knowing Bethesda something will go wrong ...
---
\*brrr
---
That vendor. I need it!!
---
That Bog Wanderer skin is pretty boss.  
---
Looks like I'll be switching out my Riot Gear, at least for a time.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Alternatively, you could make a Junkie's build and operate at full health.  You will suffer stat penalties for each addiction you suffer, but as long as you make sure that the stats negatively affected are not Strength or Endurance (assuming you're not playing sneaky), you should be just fine.
---
Oh I just noticed in game. It's whatever
---
I agree! Kills gives nearly no xp
---
I finished my first launch yesterday and had to celebrate SE with some russian hard bass.  I miss fasnacht... this was a wonderful flashback
---
if you do go for a full health build and melee get a vampires 40% swing speed knife and get martial arts youll be O.P i think
---
Its that black hockey mask and outfit one from the ATX datamine. It's called Bog Wanderer
---
19 and you can only either have Carnivore or Herbivore! With Class Freak it's worth it to just let him get every mutation.
---
No wonder my shits been fucked harder recently.
---
Yeah saw that. Got a bonus 1000xp maybe.
---
Nice build. Always like good looking towers.
---
Really good update today
---
Yeah, pretty sure the RR garage was a figment of my imagination now. But, can’t knock the Slocums stuff!
---
Papa Nurgle approves.
---
Yeah but they usually have another farmable relevant activity. This inst an MMO model, i played mmo my whole life, its a mobile gacha game model.
---
Daily ops, a new legendary boss event, meat week, and a new community event next month.
---
That Slocum's bundle looks cool as.
---
New Fallout 1st outfit and headwear! Bogwander outfit and mask. Looks like Jason (chainsaw guy) mask that was previewed a few weeks back.
---
I love it! This is the first outfit from fallout 1st that I may actually use. So awesome.
---
Same. I just got fucked. I have 2 new weeklies and 1 new daily. All the rest are still last weeks completed. Relogging didn’t fix the issue. My total lost is 8,250 SCORE
---
This is also weird. Just yesterday i noticed that when i used "Compensator" as extension i did make explosive dmg (but overall less dmg than.....) when i used a Surpressor extension. The overall behavior with a Compensator feels strange (ok, i normally only play with Surpressor, but it \[Compensator\] does less dmg, handling is bad and the explo dmg is not even noteworthy in my opinion). I would always suggest to use a Surpressor with a Gauss Rifle because the handling and dmg is much higher + plus you can snipe things 5km away with the surpressor attached and it feels worse with the Compensator (yep, that's weird and shouldn't be like that, i agree!)
---
What! That is stupid! Im at work so i guess i missed out on that one
---
Bog Wanderer
---
a Jason Voorhees lookin skin
---
yeah all false, there are NW weekly challenges so 6500points weekly only, and i also just encountered another bs, i got my last weekly quest just right bevor the new startet. if there are no other ways to gain score ( hope in this season) bethesda f up again my fun in this.
---
thank you for all the input guys :) ill have to worry about armour when i get to level 50
---
I bought an entire set of serum recipes from MODUS. Trying to get a good trade for them.
---
I don't use PA but I had the well hydrated and well fed bounses. I got hit, contracted a disease. Cured it, got hit 1 more time and contracted rad worms. 2 hits, 2 diseases while I had boosted resistance. Yet it sometimes take 3-4 shots before I get a hit while in Vats with a 95% chance.
---
Ha I just always assumed you couldn’t run a team solo.
---
I mean it just happened narrator. We need to give them the proper amount of time to do nothing so we can complain about it in the next game.
---
Thank you, youre the MVP.
---
I think you can get one from tracking unknowns.
---
Just got the Slocum PA paint this morning; Let's gooo
---
That part is debatable. I added up what I considered the atom value of the things I want (handmade skin, backpacks, raider cage, chicken coop, etc) and got around 5k. That’s more than I would have spent in the atomic shop over the next 10 weeks. 
---
I agree they went a little too all in with the ghillie and onslaught.
---
Use the Lv. 3 Bloody Mess for even more fun looting.
---
Not to defend beth on this as it does need fixing
---
This issue has been pretty well broadcast on this subreddit for the past week
---
Definitely. These are the same people who set up trap camps in Flatwoods and prey on low levels to prove that they are "good at PvP", which in reality is just cowardice. They take advantage of low levels and group up on people who are ill prepared, and then get pissed when they are bested by someone better then them, and then they go kill some low levels to make up for their anger. Its just pathetic.
---
Then I'm stumped. All I can say is given you have a new CPU and GPU that another 8GB RAM is the next upgrade I'd make. I'm assuming you've installed the game on an SSD rather than HDD too, I should have asked that one at the start?
---
Combine the other suggestions, use an instigating 2h for normal play, then junkie's for teams/big enemies because you'll get higher damage in the long run, and if you're on a team you'll be less likely to one hit everything
---
Instigating is double first hit, junkies is +50% all the time so it'll be better for big enemies
---
I play on PS4, I don’t normally go after wanted players. When my boyfriend first started playing we were running around and a wanted guy come up to us and asked me to kill him to get rid of his wanted. Okay cool no problem right? Well I did and I was going to leave his junk there cause ya know trying to be a nice person, but my boyfriend being the noob he was saw that this guy dropped hundreds of almost every kind of scrap you can think of. He took some of it cause again noob. Next thing I know I’m getting called a whore and all kinds of terrible things. Yeah sorry just had to share my experience with this.
---
That's the best bundle I've ever seen.
---
Pretty good week but not really interested in the slocum joe stuff
---
really wish they had way more weapon skins
---
If its still an item for the one quest in the mire than neither
---
It was. I'm so happy lmao.
---
So that one refreshed twice?
---
There was the RR fridge a few weeks back, and the ice box before that
---
Or how about favoriting cards we have to constantly swap?
---
People are paying a fraction of what they actually cost I've found. I did that too as a cap sink but couldn't get anyone to cough up more than 15K for each so a bit of a loss on the 18,xxx however much is was. People want to pay 5K-10K but I've found in a trade they hold their value a bit better. If anyone is about to pay full price for them then of course they'll pay 15K and save a good chunk of caps.
---
so is your mom but i dont wield her
---
Some people did not heed your advice
---
As long as it’s not the Handmade or Combat knife!
---
Oh, for... *please* tell me the Train Car structure isn't exclusive to the Slocum's Joe bundle, is it? (I'm not even sure why it'd be in that bundle to begin with...?)
---
Restart. I still have the same.
---
Thanks! My two directives are to kick ass and [to look fucking tasty](https://imgur.com/a/EIHZNY0)
---
I have no idea, but that random square out there must be the floor I’m missing.
---
Thank you for your service. And that's a great donut bundle. Here's a bunch of slocum joe's stuff... and a caboose for some reason!
---
It is :)
---
That do a crit damage...
---
I hate to use vats :(
---
Right? Why bother PVPing if you can't PVP with players that may have the same stats and levels as you. There's no point to that except to boost their own sad egos lol.
---
Mysterious Saviour, doesn't works at all. I get insta killed every single time.
---
It took me half an hour to convert 2800+ .38s into whatever the currency of the converter. I hate my life.
---
But it’s a FO1st item....so it’s free
---
Oops. Yes you’re right, i misread the post and thought it was deleted. But lol, I don’t cheat and I definitely don’t use this xp score exploit. Just because I didn’t completely bash the person for using an exploit you assumed I abuse the game mechanics too? Easy there tiger. We are on the same team here.
---
The point I was trying I’m my original comment was that the player not only cheated, but took it even a step further and brazenly displayed it (which is worse and stupid).
---
“Public events” show participants. Other smaller events do not. Public events also have free fast travel.
---
So some people are getting two refreshes of one weekly, while others are having weeklies and dailies auto complete. Surely it's not that difficult.
---
So it means he is fu***d or there is solution for that?
---
The bundle comes with the train car!  
---
I'm gonna have to redo my whole damned camp. Again!
---
You kind of can. Most of the pre-built structures like the log cabin, bungalow, and greenhouse can hold a bed, stove, stash box, vendor, and at least a couple benches. They're a little trickier to place due to the larger footprint than OP's design, but it's not hard to find a spot that's flat enough to plop them down. 
---
One of my characters lives the mobile life like this. I have a bungalow with bed, banjo, stash box, chem bench and tinker bench, and then a single foundation blueprinted with 2 vending machines and generator on it. It takes less than a minute to drop them once I find a spot that's flat enough to place the bungalow.
---
It’s an original side quest.
---
This gave me ptsd
---
Really forcing that nucleair winter eh?
---
We’re you playing during the reset of dailies and weekly’s?
---
No buddy, I have private server, I am in PC, and have 2 account :-), but THX. I really want a system to transfer untradeable ítem like ss Armor pieces beetween your diferent characters
---
Well I mean, it says so in the description but R.I.P Donut Station returning
---
That’s a really good point, it’s def not even a survival game because there aren’t material consequences for ignoring those aspects. At least not for higher level players. I’m not quite sure how to categorize the game, now that I think about it. Which is fine, not everything needs to be categorized.
---
The level 50 version is legacy now. You can still get the level 1 from the quest.
---
I mean the silver refridgerator, I see it in so many camps but it's never in the store
---
I got mine for 17500. But then again my Charisma was 37 or something ridiculous like that. My str was 54. All of my stats except endurance were 30+. Thank you glitched Unyielding! All them presents were put to good use. Traded my DC mask for 500k in presents.
---
The exact same thing happened to me, it's unbelievable, fuck*ng bugthesda, It's time for you to fix that fucking broken game... 😡😡😡
---
It means that i lost 9500 score points
---
There are these things called "public teams" that seem to be a pretty worthwhile gameplay change..
---
I’ll do that thank you
---
Im having the same issue. Do you think submitting a ticket will help any?
---
Of course it is, but for 1500 atoms that's a hell of a bundle.
---
I know, and I bought it for looks, but man I could go for an Old Glory donut or a Quantum Crunch right about now!
---
There aren’t auto completed, they are just straight up not there
---
And no I wasn’t I take extra precautions to prevent that
---
It’s a quest item
---
Shiiiiit I wanted to make a Jason character but only did a 1 month for May...
---
F me. Logged in a min before reset and now Weekly is 3/8 completed for me.
---
Its all good and it looks like we get to do the claim 5 workshops challenge again, nice.
---
I'm talking about the Sloccum Joes stuff. The camp bundle is 1500 Atom which (suprise suprise) would be our entire SEASON allowance. Throwing in that cool ass Train car prefab just makes it hurt even more.
---
Use a shotgun 
---
It counts every pellet as a separate crit hit
---
I don't want to be rude, but if you guys know this bug exists, why play the first second the game is available? I know it's Bethesda fault, but you know how buggy the game is
---
There's 7 *WEEKLY* challenges, dude. There's a new weekly NW Challenge too
---
Me too. But i did not know anything about this bug. Fuck
---
Fo4 spectacle island. There's an out house on the far side of the island where you can find two skeletons. One is a girl sitting on the toilet and the other is a dude lying on his stomach across her lap. There is a wooden paddle near them.
---
Just made a post about this but is the vending station an actual one?
---
Restart the game, they should come back.
---
Yesssssss
---
I'm having the same problem
---
Lmao no. You can feel free to submit one if it makes you feel better, but they will tell you that they “can’t” reimburse score
---
There was a spawn in mat for CAMPs in BETA. It was removed in launch for various reasons. The only way we can ham-handedly control our spawn in now, is moving the CAMP module around.
---
There are 3 spawn in nodes tied to it. CAMP owner. Team mates. Visitor. You will always face the direction you were when you initially placed the module. The side you spawn on I haven't really figured out. Some times its to the North of where it was placed. Some times the East. Sometimes West. Some times South.
---
If you are aware of the glitch Why would you even tempt it? Log off well before the deadline and wait to log in well after.
---
Hole Glory Donut
---
Yeah, sucks, but deploying a camp three times is a 10 second challenge.
---
Thanks. Easy enough. Interesting the NW weekly basically if you do 3 challenges during the week you get the same score as doing all 7 last week. Seems to help people who don’t want to do NW every day.
---
Thank you! Ill try this out :)
---
It's not forcing 
---
Its rewarding people who may not play adventure mode as much 
---
Today's challenge is REALLY easy. Like 30 seconds in a match easy
---
That's definitely not enough
---
PLEASE!
---
Oh that one, yeah I’ve been waiting for it to show up again. Pretty sure a Nuka Cola one was datamined a long time ago too which still hasn’t seen the light of day
---
Maybe it’s trying to be too many games at once so it won’t do a good job at meeting expectations of folks who like those specific styles of gameplay. But, if you’re more just into the Fallout universe and a generalist (definitely describes me) then it can be a fun game which may explain why I really like the game and tolerated all the growing pains since beta.
---
What do you have it priced at in your machines? Mine is priced at 400 caps still waiting for a collector to come scoop it up
---
Tip: Use a Shotgun close up, each pellet counts as 1 Crit.
---
Well, that's disappointing. :( The diner stuff is *cool*, definitely, but I don't think I'd personally ever use any of it... only bit I really wanted was the train car. Ah well... guess I'm waiting for a sale, then...
---
Thanks for checking!
---
Just go to Morgantown airport and mow down some level 5 Scorched 
---
It'll take 5 min tops
---
Oof.
---
Ah yeah agreed. The train car is an interesting selection. Gotta think how I’ll work it into my current build
---
Davy Crockett is the name of the IRL nuke launcher 
---
Fat Man and Little Boy were the names of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
---
reset hasn’t happened yet it’s in 5 mins
---
Wow that’s crazy first the auto complete glitch and now there just not showing up. No one is safe I’ve been waiting at least 20-30 minutes after reset to avoid the first glitch. Really hope that I get all mine and sorry to hear about yours. Hopefully it’s just like a visual bug and they will appear but that’s just ridiculous.
---
I've killed a dude in his own home trying to stash stuff. I'm like 10 bounties away from the Atom challenge finishing. 
---
I'm on PS4 and only friends can message me, my online life has never been better since. But that's not anywhere close to the best haul I've taken off someone.
---
Imagine taking a game so seriously that when you threatened the guy who killed you irl, what a loser
---
Reset happened 15 minutes ago at 12:00 EST
---
E: it’s been 7 minutes now and everything is exactly the same as it was 23 minutes ago
---
I agree. If it grows in Appalachia I'd happily add it to my farm.
---
Meant to clarify, there's 7 WEEKLY challenges, including the new NW one
---
It's not about reimbursing though, it's about resetting the state of the challenge because something wonky happened. Blizzard support would help with WoW, why not fallout.
---
Try being less douchey too, I'm a fan and a friend on this site, not a jackass.
---
This is awesome.
---
I’m guessing so, and hope so, as I can finally build a shop into my cafe
---
 That's the one.  Knew it was one of em
---
no vertibird power armor
---
why even live
---
While I personally havent had any problems keeping up with the race thus far, I can definitely understand the desire for there to be a bit more stuff listed in the weeklies so that more casual players can easily get a few more levels. 
---
If that were implemented there would almost certainly my be people who would take issue with what to do with additional score points if it became exceedingly easy to earn the amount to reach 100 early so its a bit of a slippery slope. 
---
You want people to be able to succeed but it needs to be balanced in the right way to ensure people dont feel like they are "wasting" the score points.
---
Well, free with your $12.99 purchase, which is cheaper than World of Warcraft.
---
Ward impersonation.
---
Yeah same. Looks a lot nicer than the one we have
---
As a person who still plays GTA, FO76 is definitely better.  The PvP in GTA is awful.  Just randos ruining new players' experiencing.
---
There's so many problems with this score.
---
Christ, sorry to hear that mate. At least you’ve had one positive bug to try and make up for it. Hope you don’t lose any more.
---
There is a survival tent exploit at Line in the Sand right now.  As more players become aware of it you’ll see more people showing up.  Makes the event boring, but certainly an XP gift if you’re on a Build team.
---
What are the easiest cryptids and glowing creatures to find and kill?
---
Sounds cool, I’ll check it out! Finally, a cool outfit that comes with first
---
People like that are usually mentally ill, don't worry about it too much, reporting and moving on was the right thing to do.
---
Generally they come from abusive families and/or have substance abuse issues from my personal (if subjective and limited) experience, and there's not much you can do other than what you did.
---
They said they currently don’t have plans to put in the atomic shop iirc but they could do something else in the future. 
---
The only thing I hope never returns is the gameboard. It should only go to people who complete. And honestly, IMO only to people who don’t spend atoms to skip levels.
---
Angry turtle said it's an event drop in the forest.
---
Yea it doesn't affect everyone, but to be extra safe don't have the game running from 11:30am to 12:15pm
---
Try and contact the help desk I suppose
---
Thank you for the thorough tests. I'm going to try to do something similar when I get home.
---
That's a fair reply, I'm generally optimistic but I understand the technically differences you present
---
Ill sell fasnat donuts in it, lol :D
---
What my friends and I do is we make a public event team and then all join it instantly so it’s just us an no fandoms but we still get the xp boost for events or whatever else we need
---
Damn, I thought so. Why you be like this Bethesda?
---
Ill post a shot of my excess 'Raleigh's Password' later, if it would speed this up...
---
You get the public team passive bonuses constantly regardless of distance from your teammates, team PvP ganking is dead, and Lone Wanderer's bonuses are easily met or exceded. There's just no reason not to join public teams.
---
No but from time to time certain ones will be glitched. Currently the vault boy 2000 lamp and the blue vault tec generator (not the square one) can be placed at another player’s camp, as far as I have personally seen
---
Did you have the game completely shut down when the reset happened, mine fked up last time because I was already logged in.
---
Loving the Slocum Bundle. Does anyone know if the vendor functions as an actual camp vendor, I.e, it  is a vendor skin? I know it seems kinda obvious, but Bethesda has been very misleading when it comes to stuff like that in the past.
---
Price?
---
no
---
No, that would result Bethesda selling less Atoms...
---
If you're on a team (a proper team, not a public one) then yes you can.
---
Awesome. I splurged for the 1500 atom pack. It looks pretty good. Now... what can I scrap to make way for the train car and the vending machine.
---
so randomness really, i think game goes how do i piss off people and goes, aha stick em in the floor, or in a cliff or wtf let’s just spawn them somewhere inconsistent
---
Yes.  It animates too.
---
Nope 
---
Generally 
---
Occassionaly there is a bug where certain items can be placed for a short time 
---
But it's rare
---
U can skip it if u dun like, nobody force u, u can farm the exp from adventure to cover it, stop crying over NW challenge
---
😂 sorry if I lead you down a dark path. It’s level 30 sometimes. I remember hiding behind the railroad cars right where you find him and just plucking away until it was dead.
---
Not usually. Sometimes they are bugged and let you.
---
I don't know if I agree about restricting from people who spent atoms, but I do agree that players who made it to rank 100 should have some sort of badge of honor that they made it that far. Give some people some recognition that they accomplished the full legendary run, as long as nothing gameplay affecting gets relegated to just 1% of the playerbase.
---
This is why i love my instigating auto grenade launcher with 50%limb dmg and demolition man and grenadier perk
---
How selfish do you need to be? They aren't *forcing* anything. If you don't like NW then don't play it. The time you spend doing that could be used to do the repeatable adventure challenge. 
---
How do you expect NW players to level?
---
Yeah no, PvP will never be good aslong as Mutations and Legendary Effects exist
---
Man , I want it !
---
Makes it very easy! I just head to Morgantown Airport, equip a Shotgun and Crit Savy. Sorted.
---
Yeah, "and a caboose for some reason."
---
I know Bethesda is really fond of bundle bonuses, but it's kind of funny to see a bonus that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the package.
---
WoW is 100% customer subscription based, so they can afford to have a customer support team on standby. Whereas FO76 is driven purely by FO1st subscriptions and IGP (in game purchases) or "micro transactions". It doesn't take a lot to explain why there is a HUGE difference in monthly/yearly profit margins and income for both companies so I won't go into it. Unfortunately FO76 will never be as supported or developed as a classic title like WoW or Final Fantasy Online.
---
Wow that is so shitty. Sorry to hear that.
---
It's the nature of sociopaths though, they're good at lying, faking emotions and putting up a front because they don't have a conscience that stops them or makes it hard for them to lie.
---
Given how I've seen the dark side of a lot of socially very respectable people in my life, what you say doesn't really shock me that much.  Some of the worst abusers I've ever seen are very popular people with a lot of friends.
---
It's because they're smart enough to only pick on weak, vulnerable, new people that can easily falsely accused and socially excluded before they can become a threat.  
---
Makes me kind of glad for all the cloud-synced recording and publishing capability nowadays.  Can't get away with the same stuff as you could even as little as 5-10 years ago nowadays.
---
This Slocum Joe bundle has me excited for what's to come when the BOS finally arrive.
---
Subscribed, more pls
---
I sell it cheap....but still more than anyone should pay for it considering it's free for anyone to grab off the roof at West tek.  Usually price around 25 to 50 caps and it sells fast every time.
---
One note on the map of Lucky Hole Mine in the linked-to article.  It can be very confusing because there are tunnels that go OVER and UNDER one another in the middle of the map, but the image doesn't show that clearly.   For instance, from the entrance if you go SW, you will hit a dead-end "T" junction.  On the map it looks more like a four-way intersection but it is actually because the lower-left segment passes OVER the other part.
---
While I think it would be great to have more nuclear winter challenges let us all PLEASE take a moment to realize that none of this is "forced" and we should stop saying this.  No one is being forced to do anything in relation to this pass.  It is your choice whether or not you want to engage with it.
---
Just any event in the Forest then?
---
no ward says ok but my junk item is missing get me it ill give you a kiss on the cheek and call you a good friend
---
What? have you played nothing but fallout your entire life?
---
That's an interesting possibility. A lot of people are blaming blocker, could it be Serendipity that is bugged? I can definitely test that one when I get home
---
It's a pretty crappy life to live sitting there thinking that systems aren't in place to let devs know the issues going on in the game. I've never had a true issue in the game until this set of weeklies and dailies occured. If enough people submit a big report, maybe something will happen. Maybe we werent suppose to get more weeklies and dailies and they are nerfing the overall needed score to finish the challenge. You think too negatively on the game and even it's devs. They've fixed a ton of stuff in the game, at the end of the day they are trying to strike a balance of income and fun in the game. We don't deserve constant hand outs. But we do deserve things to work.
---
That's one hell of a bundle. Gonna grab that as soon as I get home. 
---
I built so many Slocum's Joe restaurants in Fallout 4 thanks to the Creation Club set. This looks like it will scratch that itch.
---
Yeah, if both your characters know the plan then you should be able to share it. They probably won’t implement that but it would be nice. Even just caps sharing like fuck.
---
Mole Miners at the mine next to Whitespring. Snallygasters down by Charleston.
---
I never thought about how increasing gear level cap would make duped weapons pointless. I'm not a big fan of vertical progression, but Bethesda should absolutely increase the cap as a one time thing to get rid of all this duped weapons. I'd lose some nice legendaries that I worked for but it'd be worth it.
---
Really looking forward to having a look at this later! Definite purchase!
---
Junkie's builds are fun.
---
Theres 3 Snallygasters at Toxic Larry's. They are Cryptids &amp; Glowing!
---
I agree 
---
Why should NW-heavy players be forced into adventure in order to earn cosmetics? 
---
People crying that they are forced into NW ironically don't see (or care) about it going the other way too
---
The support said they cant do anything because they can't restore score points...
---
Guess we just have to pay 150 atoms per levels for what we loose, in a system where you have to get every dailies to get all the points!
---
It's just FUN
---
It's a shame we don't have a "brewed coffee" recipe. Canned coffee'll have to do!
---
No that's not it we have less challenges then before I even restarted and I still have 8 challenges 4 for daily and 4 for weekly
---
Intelligence boost
---
Good i took the gamble on saving the lunchboxes... But we still have a few weeks if double xp weekend will have the same repeatable.
---
Unless it's an easy one I just don't. Like you, I don't get anything out of battle royale games.  I bought an RPG to play it like an RPG.  Stop trying to con me into playing Fortnite!
---
500 atoms for the vending machine skin by itself and 1500 for the slocum’s joe bundle that has the vending machine, train car prefab, donut clock, checkered board black and red floor skins, diner wallpaper, donut barstool, bar, and 2 murals
---
At least that's better than this one dude on PC who was blaring Nazi music during Fasnacht. He was also nuke mining the bots. Heavily reported the fuck out of him. Haven't seen him in awhile so I hope he got banned. But I'm sure if he has a strong history of buying atoms, Bethesda will look the other way.
---
The NW winter challenges are not that hard but they are  kind of silly and feel like a waste of time.  When I play NW to complete a challenge, I am not actually playing the mode in a way that's fun or enjoyable.
---
There's pretty easy ways to complete some of them using the fire storm.  For the one where you had to use stimpaks, all you had to do was walk into the storm, drain your health a little, then hit the stimpak.
---
There is also an easy way to revive team mates.   Just team up with a friend prior to entering the match and spawn right next to the storm. Have a friend walk into the storm and wait for the storm to down him and, then revive him.
---
The creatures are simple enough.  It might take  a few matches but it's not hard exactly.
---
The survive 30 minutes challenge is just a matter of finding a spot on the map that's an unpopular spawn point because of a lack of good gear. Spawn there and hide in a bush until the storm starts up gain, and then move.
---
None of this is hard, but it is not fun either.  For me, the thrill of Nuclear Winter is hunting and being hunted by other players. But I am not doing that when I play to complete a score challenge.
---
been saying for a while that we need a legendary 'fix it good' card to fix this game!!!
---
I didnt risk it, I got the fuck out of the game till the official reset. This game has a way to screw with players.
---
Yes but if you want to engage in this pass you are forced to play adventure. It is physically not possible for NW players to get to 100 without spending the majority of their time playimg Adventure. 
---
That is counter productive to what this pass should do.
---
Sometimes my wife and I can place different wallpapers that the other doesn't know 
---
And sometimes we can't 
---
It's weird
---
Same here. I’m on PS4. Had a bonus challenge that popped up last minute for workshops and then completed a few easy weeklys just now. Seems okay for now, for me anyways.
---
Most people who pvp in games that aren't tournament style "prove you're the best" type sporting matches tend to be toxic griefers, unfortunately. 
---
It's why I prefered to PVP on equal footing back when I actually liked competitive stuff for a bit back in the day.  Like Legends PVP in DC Universe Online, where everyone had the same characters, and only skill could make you better.  
---
And where one of the easiest to get free characters (Harley Quinn) that you got first was ironically really competitive (at least at the time I played) due to her high capability for burst damage.  (Giant Mallet and all that)
---
I've launch the game after reset. It happened at 18pm for me (I live in France)
---
I wonder if you can only have one robot at ur camp. Can the collectron and the coffee bot coexist?
---
You can get 3 Snallygasters over at Toxic Larry's. There is a Grafton Monster along the river bed close to the Charleston Station, and another north of the golf course workshop. For glowing, blackwater mine is full of glowing mole miners.
---
Oh man, my camp is across the street/river from Slocum Joe's. I just might need to buy this.
---
https://i.imgur.com/iQK03g0.jpg https://i.imgur.com/NZqityg.jpg
---
Wow. Apart from the claim 5 workshops. I reckon I can smash this in 10mins.
---
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBILIS
---
I mean, don't get me wrong.  I agree with the premise of your post and agree NW challenges should get more SCORE love.
---
I don't think my gear is even good enough to attempt it yet.
---
Ohhhhh! its a vendor! well then
---
On the map, you can hover your cursor over their player icon and click it, then click the report option.
---
Did that with a person who kept attacking my base with what I now know was explosive bait aimed at my Ally.
---
Just make sure you use a machete. Jason never used a chainsaw in the movies that I can recall. He only has a chainsaw when you go to haunted houses run by people who don't do their research properly.
---
Not a bad idea. I like the separate challenges for NW and Adventure. Would that mean I can do both sets of challenges to get double SCORE each day, or would I choose a set of challenges and stay locked to them for that specific day?
---
The SCORE for events should pretty much be a thing. Although, would that unbalance teams as the non-event teams would be less incentavised?
---
I really like the game but things like this just make want to uninstall it and play something that works.
---
Wish I red this sooner ... pacifist mode was the first thing I turned on when I started because I hate pvp of any kind...
---
So I was just doing an event and one other player was there too. I usually dont mind cause the event is done faster. But after a while I just got melted away by that player a few times until I realized the mode had turned off... so that's fo76 for me today... maybe tomorrow I have calmed down ^^
---
Or, turn on your mic and ask. How would I know which perk you need if you don’t ask anyway???
---
...and now I have to rebuild a camp. :O
---
I stopped selling plans seriously a long time ago. I just drop those suckers at the Whitesprings train station and hope some lowbies get use if them.
---
How does the gullie skin work I mean I already have the nw guillemot suit so what’s the difference?
---
Looks like it refreshed again, so bonus 1000 for anyone that noticed,  completed it and didn't get the pre-completed bug.
---
I think they slow my game down. You often don’t realize you’re picking up a duplicate key and now your game has to load every single one when you open your pipboy. They really need to make it so you have one you can’t drop because they are def slowing down my game menus. I dropped all of my notes and noticed the game was faster so I bet it’d be the same with keys.
---
I'm having the same problem😡  how can I submit a ticket?
---
Nice. Wish I didn’t buy the freestate vendor recently
---
Atleast i bought it with atoms made in game... This thing is terrible
---
Yeah this has been an issue for awhile.
---
Same happened to me yesterday, I didn’t play until the evening (after reset) and got the generic „we cannot give you score“ response
---
Damn Scrapped it for more space a while back
---
You said " recognize my bone" lol!
---
i had the same issue today and put a ticket too. not feeling super hopeful. this blows.
---
Yes it’s on a SSD. I believe it’s a GPU issue. The spikes to 100% usage seem slightly suspicious. Thanks for all your help so far it means a lot.
---
Hey I just started a new character and I'm doing this kinda stuff. I need to revive someone.
---
Want to trade? You revive me I'll revive you
---
Shiiiit I’ve been doing the same thing and waiting after reset and going straight into a world. Really sucks to hear that now we can’t even do anything to prevent it. I hope when I login I have mine but I’m a little worried. Also, sorry to hear that it happened to you I would/could be infuriated about to check now.
---
Oh no, something just flew by me. I think it was time I'll never get back.
---
In my scenario you get both. If you choose to engage in both then you will level faster. If you choose to engage in only 1 them you only level at half that pace but still fairly
---
For the time when it comes.
---
I think I have 2. You're welcome to them.
---
Same. I just got on and I've lost out on 6,250 S.C.O.R.E
---
You can get it from the Whitespring. Normally it gives 10% xp. With carnivore it's 20 and add strange in numbers it's 25%.
---
Is the pack finally out?!? I have been waiting for this for so long
---
Yeah, same here. I accidentally scrapped mine right before Wastelanders, went to get a new one and then found out they don't drop any more.
---
Cool thanks, will look for that next time!
---
I logged in 1-2 min before the reset. Now Weekly is 3/8 and Daily is 6/7 auto-completed for me.
---
You’re a saint, I’m on whenever, GT is username so just find me on here and let me know if you want the queen or white springs or wherever
---
New 1st outfit looks like the Fallout version of Vigil from Rainbow Six Siege and I love it.
---
How big is it compared to the standard machines? Thanks!
---
Yes, the rewards are bought from the people at the end of the wastelanders questline
---
This game has single handedly been the worst gaming experience I’ve had in my life. I don’t know what you’re doing or how you’ve managed to play this game this long without any “true” issues. 
---
What do you even constitute as a true issue? How about the endless hackers in NW? How about all those glorious hacked weapons on PC that are about to turn a year old soon? How about just the ability to hack and dupe wildly? Your game has never crashed? What constitutes a true issue to you? 
---
There’s not a second I think that we deserve “handouts” but I’m also not naive enough to believe that they’re good people deep down. The goal is ONLY to make money. They really don’t care if it’s fun or not. They only care if it’s catchy enough to keep you invested, (believe it or not that does NOT require you to have fun, ask anyone who’s been in a toxic relationship), and as long as you keep coming back then they’ll keep tweaking it until more people are spending money. Bethesda is not a good company. There are no good companies. Fallout 76 is a product, and not a very good one. It is adequate on many levels, but it excels in extremely few.
---
I will give you that I may be too negative towards this game, but I can easily state they’ve done extremely little to earn my trust. Until they do, it’s easier to assume the worst so you can only be pleasantly surprised
---
unfair on those people that have grinded to the point of mental breakdowns
---
which is not me
---
EDT: They can just give everyone the points they would have got for doing the daily and weekly challenges up to a certain point,
---
My fault on the OG comment, still finishing my coffee ha.
---
What I do for armor is sort apparel by weight. Armor will be the first pieces.
---
Since customer service can't give SCORE points, they need to at least give 150 atoms per 1000 score lost to let you purchase levels later to offset it.
---
I don't believe alot of these. Mine has not bugged. I feel like you're just upset you didn't finish some.
---
Just get exp. Not hard
---
Will.do. I'm usually on after 6pm EST.
---
5750 in total
---
sent a bug report with pic attached. I forgot to log out and on the hour i physically saw the challenges appear and then auto complete. 
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net](https://help.bethesda.net/)
---
Thanks for posting this. I notice the legendary enemy weekly has gone down from 10 to 3 this week. I wonder if maybe people struggled with it last week so they've made it easier.
---
Also, IIRC today's NW daily is an easy one (place camp, rotate it, rotate it again) so that's nice. I might actually end up doing the NW weekly this week.
---
Also make the inert bombs from Idle Explosives stack so I can drop them all at once instead of one at a time.
---
I feel you there. Its a shame games are turning into this. I love the idea of consistently updated a game but it seems like major game developers are just taking advantage of the consumers now.
---
No longer do I intend to by any atoms or in game currencies.
---
A list of complaints we’ve gotten used to do much we don’t even mention anymore like fps
---
I mean it’s something I guess. But people only use it for the XP bonuses. And leveling up is pointless after level 50. On my second character I beat everything the game had to offer by level 70. Including side quests and wastelanders DLC. I hit a wall at level 160 on my first character and made a new. Had a great time grinding to level 50. But I’m level 100 on him now and hit the same wall. There is nothing to do unless you like constantly changing up your camp. All I do is farm legendaries and try to get good rolls on SS armor. When I get good weapons, I have nothing to use it on besides the SBQ and Imposter. Those two fights are so played out by this point. And normally become a lag fest. Roleplaying isn’t very fun in this game because nobody gives you the time of day to role play with them. We don’t even have the ability to display a chosen faction that’s displayed. It could be as simple as the faction option on this subreddit. But Bethesda wants to throw endless cosmetics at us instead of adding things like that.
---
That's actually a great idea. Will give this a shot in the future, thanks!
---
Doesn't claiming then defending a worshop count as 2 events? Each?
---
You could have that one done in like 30 min too 
---
These are really easy this week
---
I was already on so I tried to relog to avoid it essentially.
---
LMAO, what a big ol' baby poopy pants. If I get wanted, it's usually because I picked someone's lock and stole their resources(lead usually) and I deserve to be hunted. It's my fault if I don't get my junk stored before I get killed. I do make it awkward for them before the kill me though, I do the love emote to the bounty hunter in an attempt to make them struggle with pulling the trigger. It's a win-win, I get my bounty removed and they get 10 caps. 
---
Sorry you had to deal with that butthead.
---
But also a bunch of people asking for help
---
Joy, pain, sunshine and rain
---
They should really extend this to October.  I say this because there's people out there who have used an exploit to already achieve 100 percent completion.  It's another example (among many) of Bethesda basically punishing players who are honest  and don't use exploits.
---
THIS!  This is literally what I did with mine!
---
Thx for the help everyone!! Too bad im too poor for the log cabin and the slocums jou set😪
---
Can i replace existing vendors or would i have to put everything back in?
---
As far as I'm aware the only way to submit a ticket is through the bethesda website it's self
---
Edit:
---
[Submit a ticket to Bethesda here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
That's so obnoxious lol I'm genuinely sorry for your loss man
---
The fanboys are downvoting anyone who says support can't reimburse score LOL this community.
---
Awesome do you know which vendor?  Is it inside the bunker or are there more vendors at white spring? Sorry I’m still figuring everything out about this huge map.
---
My base was next to battle bots for over a year. I have so many of those key cards that some of them started to stack. I have hundreds of individual ones and many that have stacked to (2) or (3). It's really annoying lol.
---
Is it an actual vending machine? If so, im def buying it. Normal one looks trashy
---
7250 score lost thanks to bugthesda and its broken fucking game 👌🏻
---
The only time I've got some of mine auto-completed was when I re-logged around the reset timer. Today I was literally watching the screen as they removed the old dailies and weeklies from the menu one by one and then added the new ones one by one. No issues.
---
More like please do give people ideas. I hope with all my heart that I hear One More Pils during Meat Week.
---
Okay thank you
---
around 18:05 pm cest
---
Usually 5-10 minutes after server reset is what I’ve seen works and proven. Sucks, but it works.
---
And don’t play NW beforehand!
---
There's plenty of people who have posted images.
---
I'm not logging in till after an hour after the reset.
---
I myself own pretty much everything but sometimes I just want to drive around on a car but cant do it since theres tryhards wanting to increases their kd
---
You mean like virtually every other parties pass in existence?
---
Cool, but we’ve just had a diner style set with the Red Rocket? It just feels like a reskin except the vendor.
---
Then they should have tested it internally.
---
Inside the Whitespring at Le Grande Gourmet I think it's called.
---
All public events shown the # of participants whereas non public ones do not.
---
Bugged today. Reload glitched and all but 1 daily and week are already completed.
---
I'm on PC and am about to leave. I probably won't be on until after 3p.m. or later at night. Hopefully someone can help you before then.  
---
If you're on PC my user is: DocB30tn
---
Mine runs at 100% I use MSI After Burner to set GPU fan at high rate, so temps stay at around 50-60 degrees. Works fine.
---
8,250
---
What time do they reset in California
---
PST?
---
Playing a different way versus going OUT of your way to complete a challenge. So far the challenges for adventure mode have been pretty good and have helped me kinda change things up as far as what I was going to focus on that play session. The nuclear winter challenges, however, provide tasks that sometimes go directly against how you're supposed to play (i.e. reviving a teammate requires your teammate to be downed, which is not something you should be wanting to have happen at all).
---
You know season 2 will launch just as broken. Challenges auto completing is an old problem and we are still here.
---
they reset like 36 minutes ago so on that hour whatever you calculate mate 👍
---
If you want to be safe you log out at 11:55am EST and log back in at 12:05pm EST. This workaround is only necessary if you had the glitch before though. It doesn't seem to effect everyone.
---
there are 7 daily and 8 weekly challenges, must be a glitch
---
Well my daily and weekly reset today and 3 of weelky were already complete and 4 of the daily done as well so I'v lost 4750 S.C.O.R.E
---
And most of mine are auto completed via a bug on the weekly reset.  Awesome ..... :(
---
No safe method is known as of yet, latest claim was that you had to log off before the reset but that doesn't seem to be correct from the various posts today.
---
I would settle for a discounted atom price to complete the levels. Instead of 150 atoms per level knock it down to 50 per as a courtesy to forgive the bugs on this first attempt. It is a Bethesda game so these bugs are nearly guaranteed on any new content. They never should have tried to make the requirements so tight with no wiggle room on needing to do every single score challenge to get there.
---
I always wait two weeks after a new item gets added to 1st that way i can double up on the rewards (the current offering and the next one). Only signed up for 1st 4 times but i have unlocked all the 1st rewards so far.
---
Yikes, this is the whitest possible response imaginable.
---
Because I know how much an issue hacking was in GTA5 on PC, I avoided Fallout 76 on the PC. Playing on Xbox and having very few issues. I've crashed here and there, seen frame rate lag, and had the occasional stuck item in the ground with my camp. Never really had a bad experience in the game.
---
Im also not a power user, and what I mean by that is that I dont min max builds, see weapons as lottery tickets (winners and losers), or try to find the perfect balance of mutations. I just set up my CAMP, collect shit, and explore the world for what it is. Is there balance issues with mobs? Fuck yea, but I know they are fixing that and public teams helped out a ton. Im not saying it wasnt in a poor state when it came out but even when it was in a poor state, I loved every hour I sunk into the game. I have 269 hours played in game and the game puts a smile on my face every moment I play.
---
You and I are two differently players. I'm just saying you should respect that were two people in the same world and not at odds with each other. You should be a little more optimistic that the devs are actually listening. They are when it truly matters. The game is still going
---
Does that mean using the shotgun with VATS? My AP is shit, so I haven't used VATS in a while.
---
Ah no problem I'm not in any particular rush or on atm. What time zone are you? I'm BST so it sounds like things could be kinda awkward there.
---
Anyway if you get a request my username is same as on Reddit I think.
---
I only had the glitch where stuff would complete at 3/5 but I was getting the score just getting it earlier, the one where people ain’t getting shit is diabolical and for a company like Bethesda to be making such amateur mistakes, it’s ridiculous really 😬
---
As much as I enjoy this game the Bethesda  team handling it is woefully incompetent.
---
If that ship is an indication of winning or losing, I'm horribly behind and I'll never win. While the calculator says I'll complete it. So either of these things are lying lol.
---
Same that is a pain the backside.  Is there a workaround is this week a wash?
---
Yep!
---
For Honor reference 👀👀👀
---
I fully support multiple opinions. 
---
However there is no opinions in math. 
---
The old free monthly atom total buys less in the AS than even a casual player will earn under the season system. 
---
If you're upset because you can't pick and choose what freebies you get? Ok. It was still free, but less choice is not ideal.
---
The Scarlet Sniper lever action skin is half off for FO1st members too
---
I was just trying to buy from this dudes vendor, but however I just went to a player and told him to kill me since I just wanted to do my own thing
---
This was my daily a few days ago if you need proof of them auto complete without reward, I submitted a ticket and nothing so far.
---
[https://ibb.co/23mGY8P](https://ibb.co/23mGY8P)
---
Yeah the west tek building pies aren’t as good tho 😂
---
Must not have your surgical mask on in the game
---
Mine reset with 3 weekly and 4 daily already done lost 4750 also got picture proof
---
Yeah... I dunno what's happened with gaming as a whole in the past however many years, even. A lot of them seem to be out to just make as much money as possible, or focusing solely on MP, abandoning solo/co-op players... or they're trying to make "art", and forgetting that games are supposed to be *fun*.
---
Nicee
---
Zorbo started around rank 30-32 or so on day 1 so it's not exactly the best indicator on how far behind or ahead you are.
---
Ya, I'd roll those dice.  I'm sure there would be some unsavory comments but I think it would be fun. I'd want it to include gamer tag so you could see who griefed you and who might enjoy and partake in camp building.
---
Oh shit! This is awesome! I've been using my Red Rocket diner stuff to build a Red Rocket station/diner combo but this stuff works so well with it too. That floor is even better than the white/blue linoleum floor I was using. Not sure if I'll nab the bundle or just pick a couple things out but either way, perfect!
---
I only wish we had vehicles for camp so I could place them around the "pumps." De-fueled of course, I don't want them nuking my base to high heaven lol
---
I don’t think we are supposed to keep up. At least not right away. He is all the way at level 30 for me. That is way ahead of schedule.
---
Idk it all really depends. When my friend and I were doing our first nuke run I accidentally hit a guy from another group in the silo and they just destroyed me. My friend happened to do the same thing. It made me not want to play that game again tbh. I also just think it’s dumb for some person to be killed cause they have a 5 cap bounty despite any dailies.
---
I don't want to spend anything on the season. It's far too glitchy and I feel like I'll be giving Bethesda the wrong message if I progressed with atoms in spite of all the issues with it.
---
I've missed out on quite a bit of score already from objectives autocompleting or just not granting score. As fun as the board game setting and idea is, I am increasingly less involved in the season as the days go on.
---
I feel that too...
---
Why can't you post it here?
---
Zorbo started the season way ahead of any of us. I guess we'll catch up and overtake him in a few weeks.
---
Awesome, thanks so much!
---
That's the major problem I had with the situation , I was new ,still with the blue jumpsuit and some leather armor I tried to avoid player but those high level just tp'd to me , killed me , took my junk and tp'd back , it seems like a mean move
---
is this official because even on the first day it was way way ahead. And currently is on rank 40.
---
I doubt we're expected to be on rank 40. I know a few people have got there but they have put in serious xp gains to get there. Probably bloodied players with like 50 INT.
---
I have 4 for weekly and 4 for daily
---
To be fair, my issue isn't to do with the lore or anything, it's just Gail's voice acting. It can be a gruff female voice, sure, but Gail just doesn't convincing at all. I feel like the voice artist and the director didn't really have an idea of what to go for.
---
Zorbo moves one space a day, and we players can move multiple per day plus the weekly challenges allow multiple moves extra. So technically I would guess on every weekly reset we can move 5 or so spaces.
---
Use bethesda support, this happened to me and they refunded me
---
Is there a reason to expect that it would that I missed?
---
I don't have a mic. If there was a public chat option that we could type, though, I'd be all for that.
---
Hearing this makes me sad. I lost 5250 s.c.o.r.e.
---
It’s what ghost recon breakpoint did with their battle pass type thing they had going . People grinded the shit out of that but with all the complaints they ended up giving all the rewards free to everyone with an update . There was a lot less outrage than I thought . The people who no lifed the pass and got it all legit just seemed to stay quiet. .they had to have been pissed tho .
---
"Smack talking in competitive professional environments be it sports, gaming etc all happens" - Threatening to kill someone isn't exactly 'smack talk'. You expect banter but the individual pushed it beyond what would be considered reasonable. The game is better off without players like that.
---
I was online today for the weekly challenge reset. Luckily I didn’t receive any auto complete bugs at all. Strangely working as intended. PS4.
---
Not because nw sucks dick and anyone who dissagrees does too.
---
Or just never bring this dumb battle pass system back. Ever. It doesn’t belong in this game and is a lame excuse for new “content”. Fallout cosmetics should only be available from quest rewards and world discovery. I’ll never understand why people like this type of reward system in any game. The rewards that aren’t cosmetics are insulting anyway. 25 gold bullion? Thanks, I could’ve just done one public event in 10 minutes and got more gold than that.
---
Knocking it down to 100 atoms a level to me is still a slap in the face.
---
The most obvious thing is they will run the score until the season 2 patch.
---
The thing I’m not to sure on is if they will fix this buggy mess.  I had hoped to see a fix today.  Ever the optimist.
---
This is a bad place for Bethesda to be in.  It’s not just me personally they are trying to keep, but my friends as well.  I play this game for the people I play with, largely in spite of Bethesda’s incompetence.  If at seasons end enough friends move on due to this mess, they’ll lose me.  Who am I?  Someone who considers themselves a lifer for this game, and likely reflective of a lot of the people who have put up with a lot of garbage since beta.
---
I didn't understand how it worked is mainly the reason I haven't used it. Wasn't meant to be a brag.
---
New players make the game fun and the forums tiresome
---
Thanks I will do that, messed up stupid big.
---
Whitrsprings vendor sells it.
---
I'll try that, thank you!
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
&gt;The nuclear winter challenges, however, provide tasks that sometimes go directly against how you're supposed to play
---
Yes, that is exactly right.  There's easy ways to get the NW challenges done, but getting it done means doing crap that completely undermines the entire purpose of the NW mode.
---
A lot of shitty sales and rip offs posted on lfg from clueless new people trying to get into trading ,that’s what I think
---
I can respect most of that argument and I’ll leave your opinion be as we simply see things differently, however I want to point out a very important distinction between GTAO and Fallout 76. In GTA the game is entirely Peer to Peer. This means that there is no server to validate files or check that things are working as intended other than the one which loads your save data and logs in. This will check for things but once you’ve loaded in the game doesn’t really do much in the way of validating files. Hacking is insanely easy in GTA
---
Fallout 76 is run entirely through a server. The server should always validate files, and it should have many many more anti cheat and exploit measures but it simply doesn’t. As it is Fallout 76 has the majority of its players on Console. Even if it lost all of the PC playerbase it would be a big issue but it could likely survive for a bit. As it is, the issue on PC is big, but not big enough that you’ll encounter an actual (griefing) issue with it every server or NW game. 
---
You can easily run into people with hacked weapons at any Queen fight or Encryptid and it’s always visible due to the insane spread and speed at which these guns fire. Despite being widespread, they for the most part don’t interfere with your gameplay aside from one shotting the Encryptid or downing the Queen in under 2 minutes (yes I’m aware of the bugged effects on all platforms that also do this, I’m still referring to visibly hacked items). Because they don’t cause much in the way of griefing, Bethesda doesn’t want to invest in building the tools to fix it, especially for a rather minor portion of the overall playerbase. Fixes cost time and money. It’s just not worth it to them when most people don’t actually have a serious issue with it
---
Ya, project paradise requires coordination.  If the group isn't on the same page or new to the event then it's just not going to happen.
---
Question for you; what is the Magic Sword of Healing you're talking about?  I'll take any advantage I can get!
---
I love how that's a dead link
---
Nevermind, my Reddit app tries to open it.
---
Oh look, more stuff lame stuff. Who is sitting there playing FO and thinking, I really wish I could make the interior of my camp look like exactly like a Slocums Joe. 
---
How about some badass weapon, armor, and PA paints? Or some actual cool interior stuff, like a futuristic design from the institute or enclave. 
---
These silly, goofy, wacky, and cutesy type items are so over done. Some of us want a serious wasteland and camp.
---
Lost 3500 as well. Hadn’t logged in, didn’t play NW first, waited til 12:15
---
To clarify I'm not saying they should give the rewards to everyone for free, I'm saying they should make it alot more achievable. Double score for the whole season? At least if it bugs out you'll likely still get it with the amount of score you're getting - so you still have to play for rewards, not given away.
---
You shoulda nuked his camp
---
Same, I used to visit it every day.
---
Doesn't go by local time everyone has the same change over time.
---
sort by new instead of posting, and you'll see you are far from the first person to have this problem.
---
Should have nuked his camp
---
Nuclear Winter is a good mode is you get past a lot of the issues :)
---
I hadn’t even turned on my Xbox today and logged in at 12:15 and still lost 3500 score. Didn’t play NW first
---
To celebrate that your challenges did not auto-complete.
---
A guy posted [this quick view pic](https://imgur.com/wH4Uv2q) giving a good idea of where you need to be at week-by-week.  [Here's the full post with some more links &amp; a spreadsheet.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/)
---
I'm a little behind due to starting a few days later, I was at 18 yesterday when I should be at 20.  But with double score coming up, and just grinding the repeatable experience I'll catch up.
---
Plus from the rewards you get 150 atoms 10x times, so realistically spending those on the last 10 rank ups mean you only need to hit rank 90 &amp; can spend the atoms to get the last ones.
---
I finished the dailies today in about 15 minutes, I really don't see what the complaining has been about.
---
We’re getting a double s.c.o.r.e weekend and double xp weekend so they are gonna write that off as cutting some slack for people who are behind . Punksss.
---
That’s the one server we all connect to
---
Yea I  was thrown off too at first, but I thought she came around during the   heist,  and the scene with her if you talk to her back at raider camp
---
i totally forgot about that, oh the good ole days of trying to remember which bot was arbitrarily assigned to which faction so i could get my caps.
---
The green ship is about 19 spaces ahead of me and i'm rank 21. I guess they REALLY want to encourage those atom skips.
---
Crippling your limbs
---
and bonus 1k score for those who do. lets be honest, all but the survive 30 minutes can be done in a single match and you dont even have to stay in till the end, and the 30 minutes can easily be completed in two matches
---
Crap the hockey mask is fo1 exclusive? I was looking forward to that. Oh well..
---
Wow, great stuff this week!  The new F1 outfit isn't to my taste but looks really detailed.
---
This thread doesn't allow images unless it's through an image hosting site like imgur
---
this is part of an inventory mod on PC and its awesome. they have it to click a button and filter them all out and scroll through whats left. very nice feature to have.
---
when they will add fireplace? Can’t find it in atomic shop
---
Lost 3500 here. Sucks
---
I grinded to get three of the weekly's out of the way yesterday before reset and it never gave me credit for all three, just said they were completed but gave me no score. Same boat but not the same issue.
---
Apparently this isn't foolproof because I started the game up to check on the new dailies and weeklies about 5 minutes after reset. Jumped on a private server and noticed for some reason only 4 daily and 4 weekly challenges were displayed. I switched over to a public server and the missing challenges were now displayed but shown as completed. No SCORE awarded of course. 
---
On PC.
---
Most completed themselves! Thanks Bethesda!
---
NW weekly challenges are not what I wanted to see.
---
Just make them droppable.
---
I'm sure they will because it's easy to see Bethesda is going back on their word about pay-to-win. The scrap and repair kits were the start. 
---
Say you buy atoms, use them to advance on the legendary run, get free scrip, use that scrip at the Purveyor and roll a B/25/25 Fixer. Is that considered pay-to-win? Maybe, kinda, from a certain point of view. Same thing goes for whatever you use the caps and gold bullion on. It's a slippery slope that I think Bethesda doesn't mind going down due to low sales from bad reviews. It's now on Game Pass. They know the statistics of what percentage of players will buy atoms knowing they got the game for "free". I know the hardcore fanboys (I'm kinda one of them, I love Fallout and bought the last two Pip Boy editions and it's one of two games in my library that I have more than 400 hours in.) don't want to hear this but it's the truth. Spending real money to speed up your progress in the legendary run is heading into mobile game territory.
---
My main character is going through some problems with the commando, gunslinger and rifleman perks. 
---
Sometimes, they add no damage at all. It is easy to spot because I cause reduced damage compared with the expected damage. Removing and equipping perks again fixes the issue, but I don't like the idea of many other perks going through the same. It is a pain in the butt.
---
The majority of mine have auto completed. I fully shut the game down 35 mins before reset. Just logged in now. So....
---
I was reading yesterday about the death threats to the voice actress for the "bad" character in the new Last of Us. It really drives home how much the Internet and anonymity have exposed the serious underlying mental illness problems in the country.
---
You sure it was a fridge? There was the secret door as well as a pristine machine before. They also had a freezer back in January that I snagged:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ev858g/atom\_shop\_update\_jan\_28\_2020\_for\_those\_at\_work\_rn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ev858g/atom_shop_update_jan_28_2020_for_those_at_work_rn/)
---
Yeah. I didn’t know about this bug. Lost all my dailies and 4 weekly. I’m trying to submit a ticket but doesnt seem to be an option for this. Soooo, what’s the trick to avoiding it?
---
i know you want more NW. but NW is a free to play add on its not the full game and people are already required to play a game mode they don't want in order to progress on a PVE system. forcing others to do more. when NW already gets its own exclusive events and rewards.
---
I'll try again some time soon and hopefully will get a march going now that I have my [glorious sprinkled donut power armor](https://imgur.com/a/EIHZNY0)
---
70% of the time it's exaggeration. There's been a few cases where people have been attacked and wounded over games but it's not that common.
---
Report, mute and block them problem solved. The only way you can be found is if you give them revealing information.
---
So if the person is throwing out threats and you literally tell them your name and address then you brought it on yourself, don't do that.
---
That's like asking somebody really hurt angry and upset to punch you, then being annoyed when they do. 
---
I don't accept death threats i don't think it's acceptable. Saying avoiding something in it's entirety because of a chance something may happen isn't endorsing it in anyway shape or form.
---
Which is what the original commentor seems to think is the case.
---
In all my 14 years on XBL i haven't had one, and i played some really, REALLY toxic games that regularly used DDoser's.
---
The chances of an individual receiving a death threat in gaming is something like 1/500 maybe more, so avoiding something entirely with odds like that is sad and equally as far as sending death threats.
---
One extreme to combat another. Only way behaviour like this is stopped is it's reported in bulk, avoiding it is giving way.
---
Thats what I thought at 10:30 last night...really bad luck and putting 2 children back to bed later it was 1am...
---
I think it took me 6 or 7 matches total.  Terrible streak.
---
I have Game Pass for PC and I plan to using it to transfer gear to my other characters.  Plus I though of another use for it.  I can use it for the  killing a wanted character challenge.  Go pick a lock and when it is done. Shoot and kill that character
---
It is bulky though wish it could have more than 30 slots. So I could just have this boi out with 120 slots.
---
Action boy works for me if
---
Yeah, had a few crashes yesterday, week 1 was fine. But still not a really big deal for me, got my dailies done. The one issue I'm having is I can't exit power armour. Server hoped a few times, I could exit. But when I enter it again, I can't exit.
---
So that's a new way to earn SCORE basically?  Or did is it the same total of weeklies?
---
Yep, fireproof is broken for me but only sometimes like you said.
---
It will go away, but will probably keep the blueprint of the structure like it did mine. But after I placed it, in the back so not to be in the way, I was able to remove it.
---
Yeah the guy was asking what time that was, in PST.
---
No worries! Get your fix, ya junkie lol!!
---
Agreed - train car has nothing to do with slocum joes. They wedged it in there to sell the crappy slocum joe stuff.  
---
I don’t mind bundles, but If they wanted a bundle it should have made sense. Train car structure, railway rifle skin(s), railroad outfit from fallout 4, train conductors hat, that locomotive player icon, a steam engine generator (uses coal to build instead of oil), railroad crossing sign, rail track foundations. Done. A giant bundle of properly themed stuff.
---
Imagine being such a p***y that you have to threaten people because of a video game 🤦🏻 smfh. Poole I usually rage my ass off in Battlefield and CoD but I’d never go as far as threatening people’s lives or friends/families. Disgusting behavior.
---
There wasnt a weekly NW last week.
---
3500
---
I want to make a camp that is only monkey steins.
---
This is also a good idea.
---
nope
---
just tested
---
Without a doubt, it happens more and more since the update. Super frustrating.
---
I've had a lot of crashes on PS4 since patch 20, the last couple patched before that I had none.
---
Good perspective, it’s a slippery slope for sure. I am pretty sure they will add it, but someone suggested a nerfed one, without the xp buff, but let’s be honest...not many would buy it without that buff.
---
I agree. I had atoms saved up so I bought the (disappointing) bundle specifically for the train car. A railroad bundle would have been so much better.
---
It would only let you fight other PvP teams. So both teams are hostile.
---
You probably got your score at 3/5 completion and got nothing at 5/5 completion. Bethesda acknowledged it, but you will have got the reward. They haven't (AFAIK) acknowledged the pre-completion bug, which is diabolical.
---
My reset was Saturday.  I went to him yesterday and he would only sell me 100, not the full 200. So my next lvl T-65 armor is delayed a day and in spite of my best effort Smiley did not succumb to massive blunt force trauma to the head.
---
I don’t think Tenderizer is working at all
---
You're welcome!
---
Yeah, you need to use VATs for Crits. Plus, Shotguns give waaaay more damage in VATs, as they're currently broken.
---
Happened to me as well. 6 dailies and 3 weeklies were auto completed upon reset, resulting in me losing 5250 score points. Bethesda needs to fix this.
---
Im an introvert. My first time with MMO community. It's possible. I used to play gamescto be alone. Tides have shifted.
---
Can that has potential for some badass camps. Go find a prebuild one with some stuff in it and park your camp on it. Just start linking up on either side of it and have a little rolling village goin. You can probably stack them on the monorails even! We're going to see some cool camps now
---
I log off by 10:55 Am and back on after Noon. EST.
---
Do you know when this is starting?
---
I love how Bethesda finally commented when they know damn well how many posts have been on this topic
---
I would settle for a sight on my 10mm sub. I love running it cuz it’s a V/FFR/E but I would kill for even just a rudimentary site like the pipe guns
---
I don't really think they are sociopaths, they just never learned impulse control.
---
Who didn't get pissed as a kid and say stupid shit while frustrated? Or say stupid stuff just to get a rise out of someone?
---
Being seen as a loser for losing your cool or talked to by your parents taught you better ways to behave. But some people never learn how to deal with their own emotions and the anonymity of the Internet greatly contributes to that.
---
Some might be sociopaths, but most just have the emotional maturity of a 8-12 year old with nobody to hold them accountable for their behavior.
---
That would mean that people would still have to pay for something which they would have earned for free. Don't give Bethesda any ideas to take advantage of a problem they have not fixed and even more so, make money off us in the process. If people encourage behavior like this thin it will become the acceptable norm, let's not make it that.
---
Cheeki Breeki!
---
Sadly, the only "Russian" I know.
---
Grim Reaper's Spirit is broken too.  I have unequipped several times, but still has not triggered once since patch 20.  No refill and also no noise.
---
Thanks!  Also, nice house.
---
ahhh, rough.
---
For that i dont even really bother playing the game. I spawn at the edge and chill at the edge of the fire the whole time in bushes
---
I guess they are are some kind of grenades
---
Well I did not realize that at all, I wasted a ton of time then getting it all done.
---
It so people won't spam images, but you can post images by uploading them on imagur than link them in your post.
---
Really wish the Donut machine had like 120 slots so you could just have that cute boi out and no other machines.
---
I am in the same boat as you I got the skeleton suit this morning before heading to work so I need the final Christmas outfit. 14K
---
rip
---
Thanks. Looking for more feedback on this
---
It would be cute if they snarked at each other, especially the communist collectron.
---
If your looking for something just too sink caps into then sure maybe.  But really getting the bio card is so easy it’s not really needed.
---
&gt; tweet by a Beth employee saying they'll change the ammo machine so far
---
Does that not count as them saying something publicly/officially?
---
Can anybody else confirm this?
---
Oh. So I have a legacy item on me.
---
It's an actual vending machine, and they snap together, which is freaking sweet if you're trying to build a restaurant counter type things.
---
one of my team mates saved up for the strangler heart mask ( vault 76 ) as his first bullion purchase ( 1600! ) and was devastated to learn that it has no special effects other than preventing environmental disease.  So I'd save that one til last unless you're really into the vine aesthetic
---
Well I was hoping they would get the broken challenge issue resolved and also give the missing score points to anyone filing a support request. I just meant as a backup measure to discount as I'm sure many people will get frustrated with the current system and give up long before 10 weeks are done.
---
I got a snowflake armor last night
---
A dev had said something a rework but with some vague reference to going away
---
Edit: no clue on the score I too would like to know
---
I don't get posts like these. You had in interaction online, wow...
---
Thank you. Hopefully we can get some others to test this out.
---
Ha, not as nice if you look at it *in person*. But no problem!
---
Like what others have posted there isn't an official way but there are several youtube videos of people showing the stats, requirements etc.
---
Cool, thanks
---
&gt; 1 of the 2 that are left are for NW which i wont be playing
---
Deploying a camp 3 times takes 15 seconds. Don't be lazy.
---
Some of the comments when it was datamined suggested it may have been a vendor for the camp similar to how Beckett works.  Just wanted to let everyone know that was not the case.
---
Where can I find these plans or is it in the Atomic shop?
---
no, its going to make it even easier.
---
You know it's steel, not steal right? Pretty important to get spelling right in tattoos.
---
Um have you read twitter lol?  Jokes aside it helps but something on their website or from a community manager would feel differently to me.
---
Make sure you can spell it correctly first.
---
It’s an 8th weekly. So 1000 extra available per week
---
Damm that blows
---
All my vats are bad - it automatically disengages when I start shooting even though they are in sight and I have plenty of AP :(
---
Which bundle involves the train car? I can't seem to find it.
---
&gt; Who is sitting there playing FO and thinking, I really wish I could make the interior of my camp look like exactly like a Slocums Joe.
---
Um...a lot of ppl actually.
---
Roughly the same footprint side to side, but a bit deeper front to back. They actually snap together as well, in case you wanted to create a clean line of them.
---
Atom Shop
---
My challenges reset perfectly even the one to claim 5 workshops again, I had the game and console switched off during the reset.
---
Belated 4th of July. Like everything else which belated it seems...
---
I finished it anyway as well, just in case it bugged out. You never know with this game.
---
As someone who's played Elder Scrolls Arena, this bs has been around forever.
---
How long will the fallout 1 jason outfit last for grab any time limit on it?cause im not home for another 19 days
---
That's what finally drove me to go vertical.   BP's are stirs that to up to floor, then have different "level" contents (furniture, crafting, turret, garden, etc).  At that point it's just drop a 1x1 foundation and snap on what I want for that camp/workshop.  Maybe use some metal columns so it looks decent.
---
Thats huge if kept in for a casual like me.  I get 2 days a week for good runs and maybe a half hour per day outside (bonus if I'm lucky) so far I havent missed a daily or weekly so this makes me feel good. Ty!
---
Fast travel to Hemlock Holes. Kill the Grafton Monster that’s wandering around and head towards the downed Vertibot. There’s usually always a couple of Snallygasters hanging out there
---
Roadmap in last week's ITV
---
I believe the double xp weekend starts from the 16th - 20th and the double s.c.o.r.e weekend is from 23rd - 27th.
---
The only time I have done PVP the guy started it by shooting me in the back. I reflexively spun around and shot back, thinking he was a scorched. Then he killed me and I was like, "Whoops, my bad." I was a little irritated that he took my junk, but I wasn't mad. I can't imagine being mad that I started a fight and then lost. That's one of the two possible outcomes. You die or you don't. If you can't handle losing, don't start fights.
---
It's from the latest Atomic Shop drop, costs 500 Atoms. I'd highly recommend it.
---
How about not giving death threats at all. Talking trash is one thing, but death threats just show a level of toxicity that should get you banned.
---
Just saying
---
People who get this angry at a game need their parents to take away their PC/console.
---
Thanks. I know how I'll be spending my weekend now lol

---
He's the project lead you donut.
---
I didnt even notice what it was dude. I just meant in general. Its nothing to do with friggin laziness. I just hate BR.
---
Completely updated.
---
Really odd how one of some people's refreshed early and refreshed again at normal time, while others refreshed at normal time but 3/4/5 of them were already done. 
---
I wonder if they'll acknowledge the issue soon?
---
Yea I accepted that fact awhile ago, doubt it will ever not be buggy.
---
Or maybe they should fix one of the *main selling points* of their game. They made most of their sales because of their emphasis on multiplayer and PvP.
---
wow.
---
Strangely enough I noticed Claim 5 Workshops popped up around an hour before the new weekly challenges reset (for a 1000 atoms). It became a mad dash then to complete them on the private server before the time was up.
---
As someone who has really been missing that jingle, thank you so much. *patriotic salute*
---
Its twitter you knob slobber.  Why you being an ass?
---
Are you new to F76?
---
Ok well then you're the first player to tell me they don't use VATS as a "gitgud" brag ;)
---
Tell me about it, hate it when assaultrons glitch out and have no cooldown on their laser.
---
The grammar, spelling errors and run on sentence(s).... Are you... Are you in this games target demographic?
---
No worries, good luck.
---
Did you check out the Atomic Shop first? Because that usually auto-completes stuff for most players. Yeah, I know it mustn't, but it has been doing that for months now.
---
Rule of thumb: Quit the game well before the reset hour (not at the last second, and be sure to completely close it), and only resume playing after the half hour mark. **IMPORTANT:** Never go to the Atomic Shop first nor start NW, **always** log into a (private or adventure) server first.
---
Nuclear winter is actually really fun. Fallout just has bad gunplay
---
Bwhahahahahh that's funny and embarrassing...yes I know its steel....lol toooo funny
---
Yeah the max discount you get is 25% which works out exactly from 25,000 original price.
---
I like it because it’s somewhat fun and it isn’t too intense like fortnite where I could get pissed, also I grinded for my ghillie suit on my commando and now with the ritual make he really looks like a post war grim reaper
---
He's like 2 weeks ahead of me and I didn't miss any challenge..
---
You should get your atoms on the day you renew F1st each month. It's around 1650 atoms so if you are missing any, send Bethesda Support a ticket. They may take a day or two but they are pretty good regarding refunds.
---
If I get FO1st now, do I get an NCR ranger outfit as well? Or is it replaced by this one?
---
It's pretty much certain that the keys in a game like FO76 are not using packed bools.  They will each be separate database objects with multiple standard field sizes, as well as the data container maintenance overhead and any graphical requirements there may be on top of that.  In the grand scheme of things it is still small, but it is not trivial.
---
Can you deploy it underwater? Asking... For a friend...
---
NW isn't free to play? Nuclear Winter is locked behind owning the game.
---
Nuclear Winter gets exclusive events and PVE players complain they have to do that too. Season passes should encourage ALL modes. 
---
The pass isn't just PVE. So stop with all that. They aren't forcing adventure players to play NW. The time they spend complaining about having to play NW for a SINGLE daily, they could spend grinding the repeatable for the same amount of XP.
---
Nuclear Winter players on the other hand, are forced to play a mode they don't like, for rewards they can use. 
---
If the pass is only based on PVE then it should only be accessible in adventure mode. However its accessible on the main menu, the same main menu where you choose what mode you want to play.
---
Blocker works IF YOU ARE STANDING.
---
If you are crouched it is not working.  Tested this inside power armor and out, same results.
---
Seems to happen to some people and not others. Bugs in the system unfortunately. Take an in-game photo and send it to B/S.
---
Yup! You get everything unlocked for FO1st members
---
Edit: clarification: You WILL get the ranger outfit and the new bogwander outfit
---
Nice, appreciated!
---
Why not read the last 30 posts you’ll get the answer!
---
Easy trick is to do modular BP's in 3x3 sets.  My stock is 3x3 with center tile containing top of stairs.  Ring outer edge with the 1/4 wood wall from defense.  That's big enough for bed and all crafting stations.  To deploy you just drop a foundation and snap stairs in BP to it.  Workshops the 3x3 ring is mesh with turrets, farming is a 3x3 ring with crops, etc.  Takes time to build the level blocks then it's nothing to snap together a workshop outpost or camp.
---
I believe it’s Julie
---
I logged out way before reset. Yet i lost out of 8 challenges all together.
---
You take video games too seriously
---
I don't remember there being a nuclear winter weekly last week, is that new?
---
Good to see them add some more challenges if so. Some of the challenges for nuclear winter feel like I gotta cheese the system to get them done.
---
I like the adventure challenges. Gives me aome direction for each of my play sessions, especially since they don't take long at all.
---
Also, glad that the xp repeatable is a fixture, one or two people weren't too sure.
---
So it all makes sense now. I use fireproof+ blocker with a  full Uny SS set and yet i die  to scorchbeasts and shit. Would gladly take a break but i would lose the race to 100
---
Took me all of 5 minutes to complete the daily, 99% was login time.  I'm not a huge NW fan but ill take easy points.
---
I gathered about 20 of them before I realised *you don't need to pick up any more*.  The ones you still have from previous events still work.  You only need to kill the first bot, you probably want to kill the two others inside the base but don't loot them, just go ahead and use existing keys to stop useless shit cluttering your inventory.
---
I'm so glad that my experiences have been pretty uniformly nice, or even fantastic. The other day in Nuclear Winter, a guy gave me the nuclear briefcase and codes so that I could experience nuking first-hand! It was very cool. 
---
I've gotten a bounty on myself once, because I didn't realize that opening a lock on a box while participating in a workshop defense didn't make me an ally automatically. But I didn't begrudge the person who killed me. Take those caps! Have fun!
---
It’s great, but the wire. We can have pristine looking houses but can’t wire things without it looking horrible.
---
And? Is earning exp hard? Just playing too much for you? It's a free battle pass with double score buff events. 
---
Plus how many glitches you using, base budget, carry limit glitch, ECT.  Almost everyone uses 1 of them, that factors into it.
---
Another take, my wife and I are both leveling it up and playing, she had an auto complete 1 day but she's ahead of me. 
---
Sorry if I seem toxic but I have a large group playing with us and this never happens, as in missing 7k xp on board. I'm sorry but to me that's a lie. 
---
People can be way ahead of you, just by xp grinding
---
I had the claim workshop weekly show up an hour before the reset, shits still borked.
---
It's going to be a terminal...
---
Holy sh\*t this spiraled fast! lol
---
I thought this was going to be a "I love the community" post.  Now I'm picturing you burning your clothes and microwaving your hard drive. lol
---
I think you'll be fine.  Bethesda isn't going to come after you and considering the level of hoarder this game has made me, ya, he probably did have that many hand made gifts.
---
Thank you for posting the challenges. I hate being at work all day and not knowing what the challenges are.
---
Yup, drop by the fires edge, drop camp 3 times then run into the all cleansing fire!
---
In what category is the vending machine? :) still haven't Found.
---
Edit: found in the most obvious category ever 🙈
---
Thanks. Now the question becomes is that working as  intended or a bug..
---
Yeah, that's greedy as fuck because it doesn't even belong to that bundle. I appreciate the new bundle and it looks nice and all but i love my camp and not going to build another bar. So how am i supposed to get that train car now?
---
&gt;I just stated how level gated content can work....    
---
    
---
By comparing it to an MMO.
---
Should have nuked his camp to make him super mad.
---
&gt;it's like a dev added a couple more zeroes to the drop chance by mistake and just couldn't be bothered to change it
---
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised. Makes no sense for it to be that rare and it wasn't rare in Fallout 4.
---
F I feel you I just got the bundle I said fuck it
---
Fuck the moving on part just keep pissing them off lmao
---
Hey, I get it man. I’m pretty gritty and grungy myself, and I want some raw, brutal, and menacing products from the atomic shop as well. But that’s only one slice of the pie. A lot of different people play this game so there’s gotta be a different flavor for everyone. Recently, there’s raider bundles, cultist bundles, new handmade skin, PA skins...there’s been everything you’re asking for. You can’t let some of the other fan base be happy about some cute goofy camp stuff? I’d say Bethesda’s not doing too bad of a job about mixing up the atomic shop. I just wish they weren’t so focused on cosmetics for a game that barely runs...
---
Thanks I really appreciate this
---
how is it that a research-based post on huge bugs cant get 100 upvotes in 4 hours??
---
im so sick of posts with real substance taking days to get actual recognition (if they ever do at all) while the front page is constantly littered in garbage posts about how 76 changed their life, or whiny rant posts about other players being mean, or completely not funny, corny, rehashed jokes. 
---
the community could benefit so much from research-based posts and quality breakdowns on mechanics. we get some really nice ones that make it to the front and shine, but they are few and far between. meanwhile the top post on the sub rn is "some people were mean and idk how to use the mute button or report feature" with over 1k upvotes.
---
Eh, it's a bonus extra and the NW challenge for today is literally place a camp x 3. That takes 5 total seconds of play time.
---
The slocum joes one. For some reason.
---
Ticked will be given the response of "we are aware of this glitch and however we will not be granting score"
---
Yes brother
---
I usually stop playing hours before the reset and wait an hour or 2 after it, and i've yet to get the auto completion bug.
---
swap servers
---
Thanks. Didn't realise it came with a train car. Is the vending machine with bundle any good?
---
I rename all the stuff I use most often, and put '-' signs in front so they appear together.  For example:
---
\--Unyeilding torso
---
\--Unyeilding left arm
---
\-Sneak torso
---
\-Sneak left arm
---
I do this with weapons too, so I get tools (camera/shovel) up top, melee weapons next, then guns, then all the crap I picked up and don't use.
---
Why don’t you just server hop and claim a different one?
---
Oh right I getcha, that makes perfect sense lol
---
How do you deploy a camp in NW?
---
Google "Brotherhood of steel tattoo" yes, that's a thing.
---
Ah, didn't realise that. I basically wasn't paying attention to the NW stuff last week, apart from when someone posted on here about an easy challenge.
---
That's the risk of taking workshops. Don't like it? Get a private server.
---
This has been a prob since the early days unfortunately.
---
Been around since beta, have hated nearly every atomic shop them and bundle released so far. 
---
Free states, mothman, aviator, responders, nuka cola, etc are all super lame. Too colorful and silly
---
Can anyone confirm if the wall clock is in the bundle? Bc its in the pics but not the description.
---
Thats where we differ i find it fun to do something i enjoy i find it not fun when im forced to do something i dont like especially if its easy
---
I know how todo that...was looking to see if people on this reddit had them.
---
So.. How do I fix this "challenges already completed" bug?
---
Get a legacy for yourself and be the jerk for others.
---

Nice! I tried dressing my wanderer ally in the tattered dress to pretend she’s my new novice trainee but she’s so dirty looking I had to put her in something that covered her better.
---
I am so happy they added this!
---
Its rediculous, a small amount of courtesy doesnt kill anyone
---
I still give a lot of newer players gear, blueprints and meds to start them off and if i see them at an event like the wolf horde one, i either avoid it or let them tag the legendaries first
---
I’m on PC
---
Thank you 🙏
---
I didn't realize what he had at the time.
---
Sorry man not everyone can get rank 100. It's for the best.
---
Can’t believe people are “quarantining” themselves over a contrived virus.. fucking bots lol
---
This is why I rarely touch that event.
---
My camp is across from Slocum Joe's and there is no train car there. I wish they would open it up and put the NPCs inside it that are always fighting scorched out front. Make it a vendor too.
---
id pay 500 just to turn of vending machine music
---
They said half of the challenges. Not playing the game. So read it again. Based on their exact wording that would mean skipping half of the challenges for seasons and still getting all of the rewards. It is not reasonable to get all of the rewards for seasons by not doing half of the challenges. My examples have the option of playing the game as well as doing challenges for extra progress. For Fallout 76 playing the game would be getting the repeatable challenge finished while the extra challenges are the daily and weekly challenges (not including the repeatable). I never said you get rewards in anything by not playing the game.
---
Still bugged out for me.. All but one daily and weekly were already completed upon reset.. Minus the SCORE points I would have got
---
generally 4 weeks

Calibrating the Boolean field to create a tachyon beam that will cut through the negatron interference and allow the particle de-molecularizer to remodulate the quark configuration of the energon tubes in the hyperspace drive thrusters.

I have one but I want to take advantage of Public teams.
---
Fuck no.
---
Shhh don't tell him lol.
---
Did you do it right at the time everything rolls over? I know that’s a known glitch for the dailies.
---
Then join you private world with your friends and make a public team.
---
Add key to keyring?

I remember discovering that farm before it was ruined. I think it was about 3 weeks after launch. It's been a nightmare ever sense.
---
wanna know too, what that thing is.
---
I was getting ready to server jump and it appeared so i figured why not give it a go with a friend, turned into chaos rather quickly
---
Trying to get a chunk of scrip for when i need to roll for some decent gear like a legendary bear claw or fixer (currently own both blueprints)
---
Nice, nice. You put some good work into your gear there. Who knows, maybe one day we’ll both be fellow rangers at the same place.
---
Have you been able to play today?
---
No I did it about an hour afterwards. It just counted one as all three.
---
Ah thank you i was waiting for it since it was datamined
---
The problem with Uranium Fever is that the majority of the time when I don't 1 shot everything the mining equipment inevitably breaks and absolutely no one will repair it but me. People would (and have) just stand there while the event counts down to failure. I always make sure to just tag the supervisors but it's more of a hassle than it's worth a lot of the time to just tag each of the normal mole miners.
---
Why don't you PM me your info?  
---
I'm on CST, on PC, and user is DocB30tn. You never know when grouping might help in the future.
---
I havent checked but do the supervisors spawn in the same location or does it change?
---
First time I’ve heard of anyone doing that.
---
That goes with any game with a pass. If you finish the pass early then you can just not do challenges after that.
---
Does he move around? It's a definite buy for me if he moves or talks.
---
Edit: spelling.
---
Strange I've got a 2* Hunting Rifle that  needs to be fixed every 20 minutes of use, lucky if I get 50 shots out the thing.
---
Its a beach. If yiu have perk packs you can use those for xp
---
I have had this issue on and off since the run has started.
---
The watoga high school also has tons of plastic in the cafeteria &amp; kitchen.  Each table can have a couple sets of plastic plate + 2x-3x cutlery.
---
I think they can come from any point the normal molemen spawn. But I swear 8 times out of 10 they come out of the entrance where the workbench is.
---
I was so scared to try it, but now I do enjoy a few rounds just for the change of pace and sweet new rewards.
---
I've done this event countless times since level 40ish. 8/10 it would be without a trouble, all players emoting when legendary spawns so everyone can go and shoot.
---
Those others 2/10, I literally log off that server. I wont waste my time no more with shitheads ruining my playtime.
---
And if you’re on Xbox, I know it’s not much but my camp is on an acid deposit so pm me and I can get you some acid for little to no cost.
---
Saving my atoms for legendary run levels
---
Every player was active during the event 7 of us and the equipment barely got touched
---
Letting people tag something is hardly any effort or hassle at all when the supervisors usually beeline for a player thats nearby and drop really fast
---
Is the daily/weekly bug that you're talking about, about only a few showing up as new or where some people aren't getting points for completing them?
---
&gt; If you are marked as Wanted please don't ~~give IRL Death threats~~ commit felonies
---
Man I really don’t like being wanted but if I am I love people that kill me because at least they get caps and I get to see everyone again in the map.
---
I couldn't at the time.
---
My husband has one. It’s my favorite one, actually.
---
You didn't have a bounty though, that was accidental PvP - the guy in the OP did something worthy of getting a bounty (accidental or not) and paid for it. Instead of taking the loss, he sends death threats. You can't compare the two. Bounties are there for a reason and as someone else said, anyone with a bounty is fair game. In fact, I'd say it's more beneficial to let yourself be killed than continue having a bounty.
---
You can turn on Pacifist mode and you will never accidentally get into PvP again (workshops don't count). The only thing you lose when you die is junk and pride. But if they are continually griefing you then it's different. I hope I'm not coming across too harsh but at the end of the day you can block that player (report them if appropriate), swap server and never see them again. Some random POS shouldn't stop you from enjoying the game, so don't let them win.
---
Yeah. When i tried to do it on a foundation it was going crazy
---
The whole disease system is pants-on-head bonkers and could use a complete re-work.  Disease effects are small enough and go away soon enough that I genuinely do not give a single fuck when I catch a disease.
---
its worse now with teams than it ever was before.. and it was pretty bad before
---
I’d actually shoot my explosive one if I could mod it.
---
Its a new skin for Player Vending Machines. It is NOT a robot vendor for your Camp.
---
It’s basically a player vending machine.
---
TIL it's Slocum's Joe and Slocum Joe's
---
It wasn't a option at the time because we tried forcing the griefer away first.
---
Following - also hoping it's still bugged
---
I was on the other day and had an opposite experience. They all spawned in the cave on the upper level and they would wave everyone over to get a chance on the legendaries. It was a cool experience. 
---
That being said I’ve had plenty of times when it sucks. I have taken to carrying a pipe rifle just for this event.
---
FYI you are lvl 20 and so am i, mine have not auto completed. I've done all mine. Soooooo that would mean you are not missing any
---
Yeah I’d like to know too! I really wanted to grab the holiday stuff I missed!
---
Been looking for the date, thank you very much
---
Does it? I heard it doesn't. I might be wrong though. Not been able to test my self.
---
Do those supervisors spawn in a specific place or is it randomised
---
If only Bethesda would make instanced events this wouldnt be an issue, get a group together and make it so every player that actively participates (gets x amount of kills or damage) gets any legendaries that drop
---
Mostly just seasons and public teams
---
One shotting the supervisors is never acceptable but just wait until there's players crawling all over the place and no one is repairing the machines. It will happen eventually and you'll see that sometimes it's better to complete the event than for everyone to tag all the trash mobs.
---
I want to live in key ring world
---
Yea it is certainly getting worse. I got a death threat from a guy in a mw lobby simply because I joined lated and got 5 more kills than he did.
---
Best one I ever saw said 'No Regerts'. Poetic stuff.
---
Somebody on reddit said he dances
---
Its the same as the normal just a different skin.
---
Nah, let’s go somewhere new. The Capital wasteland should be left for now that way we can’t really interfere or retconn with any lore. I’d prefer to go to Pennsylvania, where we could perhaps find new lore in an area that failed to automotize the mining industry in order to rival WV which would result in civil unrest, greater than that of WV. This time the protesters wouldn’t be crushed, and start getting a foothold in fighting against the corporations and government. Maybe meet a few free states people who fled. It would also bring new attachments to weapons like the pickax to deal extra damage to robots and such.
---
So is it always the same spawn?
---
This is a PA buff we need, along with many others
---
thats for me like  since wastelanders, 1 shot and i am of of vats and need to engage again and again if enemie not dead.
---
Alright tight then I'll probably get it.
---
I just want to be able to contribute without an explosion going off as im about to hit something and it instantly dying or not being able to tag a legendary
---
Why jet pack? I drop those. Does anyone actually look for that plan?
---
Had a guy kill me when I was wanted, said hope there's no hard feelings after, didn't take any of my junk and even gave me a present, good guy no hate.
---
SCORE points awarded.
---
I cant even be bothered to try teams, i dont remember anyone in the community even asking Bethesda for it
---
That's awesome. I don't have the ghillie yet but think it would be nice to have
---
Welp, I’m behind, despite daily play.
---
After that, a single player fallout with role playing would be nice
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
No, you had them already. Just before you finished the challenges. I know the junk one gives it to you at 3/5 for example. 
---
You haven't lost any score.
---
Oh I see, so you were just hoping you could chase them off.  That’s why I never lock anything on my workshops is so I know if they are taking it they are likely just doing it solely for pvp purposes and not to gain access to the resources.  Saves me a lot of headaches.
---
Get that pristine miner uniform to go with it
---
With respect, how much time have you wasted on this guy?  Just mute/block.
---
“Remember the good old bad days”
---
My GT is Commissar#6088, message me there or here
---
Nuka cola is lame? That’s like vault boys official sponsor. But seriously how do you hate something that is in, and a big part of, every single fallout game? Do you even like fallout?
---
Its not the gun. If it wasn't a expoding laser it would of been a exploding handmade or guass minigun or something else. There are damage caps, meaning there is a cap (I think its 120) on how much damage you can do per shot. Its easy to reach that cap with many different kinda weapons, even fast firing ones.
---
Unimplemented content makes it clear that Fawkes was a man, and Emil Pagliarulo (first time trying to spell his name without having it in front of me, probably messed it up) said at some point that Fawkes was definitely male.
---
Tru af
---
Who didn’t built a slocums joe in every fo4 settlement. Even my vault 88 (or whatever vault you could build in with the dlc) got to taste a few donuts
---
Or the entire point multiple people were trying to make. But of course you dont need to fully absorb and consider our opinions because you are a teacher.
---
Quit defending them, they have lawyers and more money than they know what to do with. I've been a loyal player with more than 4000 hours in game, but I will not defend them, I actually love this game, I don't personally care for the management. Even though I love it , I know damn well it's broken af. And they care very little about our enjoyment.
---
Thanks for the tip. Nowhere near confident enough to stroll to Watoga with this new character yet!
---
same here but how we get  attention do this bug? did you send this to the support?
---
Yes, the "only a few showing up as new" is actually them auto completing. They seem to be investigating the issue
---
Same here. I was logged off until just now too.
---
They  WILL give everything for free to everyone. Mark my words and come back to this post when the season is over. Nothing and i mean NOTHING is worth grinding in Fallout 76.
---
Did you get the score for the weekly?
---
Just join a team for the XP bonus and free fast travel points.. you don’t even need to do anything with your team.
---
You think that would make a difference? Like they wouldn't use an explosive handmade instead?
---
He started ahead at rank 32, currently 40, and I'm at rank 22 currently and skipping NW challenges.
---
Yeah, we blocked him but he also goes invisible too.
---
More then that, as levels go on the amount of score needed increases.
---
&gt; Saw a Preston Garvey once too.
---
If that guy didn't randomly approach people and say a settlement needs their help it would be a crime. I hope I see them some day.
---
Dang, I thought the Slocum Joe vendor was a DJ at first look.
---
Same issue. I took pictures of it and sent the feedback in. Only difference for me was I was online at the time. I think it still has something to do with it. If you are online while it is updating, it gets auto completed. I had been logging off 5 minutes before and waiting ten minutes after and hadnt had the issue until not doing so.
---
But whats the actual point of the system itself?
---
I might add probably best to avoid checking the legendary run board as well. Not willing to test it but seems similar enough to NW and atomic shop thing that I wouldn’t risk it.
---
Spawns are random. I don't know if there is a proper way to fix this, I think some people are just helpless. If they can destroy anything with a sneeze, they can do the event in private, as I do most of the time. But they enjoy screwing the event for the others.
---
Nice.  I have been asking for black &amp; white tile floors for a good while now.  And I've also asked for Fallout 1st outfits that aren't Ranger variants.
---
You know what?  Today has been a pretty good day.  I saw someone driving around my tiny town with a sticker for my favorite Swedish band on their car.  Our termite inspection was today, and we don't have termites.  AND a friend accidentally sent me a photo of his wife's butt.
---
Same way you do in adventure mode. Open pip boy and deploy camp.
---
They don't just fix things in this game. It would be next patch if anything but there has been things broken since launch an they still don't care.
---
Yeah
---
nope. i tested it
---
I missed it by a minute and got the pre completed bug and didnt get that score either. I lost big.
---
Well thats nice.
---
Deng that was my fav perk
---
?
---
After seeing the Vault-Tec Bomber Jacket was normally 1000, I'm surprised the train car wasn't sold for 1500 by it's self.
---
IMHO I think the current set up is fine.  Yes, it sucks when high level players (or any player really) can take out the legendaries in one shot, but the way I look at it is that you are there to complete the event and get the event rewards.  Getting a legendary drop is a bonus, not a given, and some events give you events as one of the rewards anyways. 
---
Look at Fasnatch.  Your reward for getting the best result was a mask and up to 3\* legendary item.  If you got the legendary sloth, great, that’s a bonus. 
---
If you are doing Arktos, your goal should be to try to get the lab coat or the bear claw plan, not primarily looking for a legendary drop
---
If you want to farm legendaries, I find server hoping and having a good legendary creature route is a much better plan, or just get FO1st and solo events (or with friends) on a private server, which is also sometimes worthwhile.
---
If you're talking about the one that opens like a door. That's not an atom shop item. It's added in the legendary run rank 99 I believe.
---
friendly fire only works with melee damage, so the only weapon to bother using it with is the shiskebab.
---
Legacies are worst.
---
So much this, I despise adventure mode and it’s chores of everything, I just enjoy the consistent fun of NW that doesn’t get old.  
---
I barely go into Adventure to do the stupid challenges to earn score, and get the hell out. NW should be viable to get to level 100, not both, give both player bases there own ways and all this constant crying will end.  
---
Also I get the bug every time where my perks in NW reset as it says I don’t have enough special points.  Even though my adventure character is fine and fully configured correctly perk cards and shares the same damn special points.  For the adventure princesses that’s literally having to redo all your perk cards every time you go into a play session.
---
I mean it’s suppose to help you find players that want to play the same way as you do. I just start a team when I spawn in and do my own thing.. people join the team I get XP bonuses and I still just keep doing whatever I was doing.
---
I do enjoy having between 3-6 extra free fast travel points on the map though.
---
Yeah thats why me and my two buddies do the event on a private.  Are you on PS4? U can join us.  Im level 60. My level 250 bloodied  buddy just draws the legendaries to the middle so I can get a shot in before he finishes them off with one shot.
---
Honestly if they fix this while leaving the autocomplete/losing score bullshit unfixed... I’ll be upset.
---
What level you on on board?
---
To make you want to buy the bundle... every bundle has an exclusive item
---
Except maybe the rank up challenge. That one can be annoying.
---
Just like you do in the live version. Open Pip Boy, place CAMP.
---
Also you can do this challenge in a matter of seconds: Just place a CAMP, run a few feet, place a CAMP, run a few feet, place a CAMP, try not to die. Also if you're interested in actually building CAMPs in NW one thing you might want to do is create blueprints in the live version (no electrics, no turrets) so they're easier to drop and build. I mean I never bother but you might, candidate.
---
Just because something has never happened to you or anyone you know doesn't make it a lie. It hasn't happened to me either. 
---
I'm using none of the glitches, and never used duplication glitches either as I think they take something away from my enjoyment of the game. Same with cheats on other games.
---
XP grinding isn't hard, but it's also not fun (for me at least), so I would prefer not to have to do it to catch up on score I would have got from things like "eat 5 cooked meals", which can be done in around 1 minute.
---
Ever heard of a train car diner?
---
That’s dumb
---
Is there somewhere that list items by rarity? Been playing a month now and having a hard time discerning these things, I would never guess this item is 1, rare and 2, something people actually want.
---
I'd assume there are more items like this, I'd like to not potentially miss out.
---
so you're saying I can have wine with fries so long as I get the from anywhere featured on r/wewantplates ?
---
RemindMe! 9 weeks
---
Yeah that weekly challenge that popped up last minute I managed to do in 10 minutes before reset so I got another 1000 score by looking at the reset time left.
---
The level of entitlement in this post, wow. It shocks me to my core honestly. It doesnt take much time to do the NW stuff, and youll level up in NW and get more rewards too.
---
Dude. Try to do it yourself. You might find a new hobby, or discover a new talent.
---
Look for ideas, look for other players camps for ideas, watch some youtubers camps.
---
Be creative with the resources and plans you have. Don't like it? tear ir down and start again. Found an awesome spot? Start a new camp with a totally different idea from the past one. 
---
Have fun
---
They added an 8th challenge and you are complaining?
---
Thanks my dude, I really appreciate it. Hope you have a wonderful day as well!
---
I 100% believe that in the final week(s) of the season we will either see everyone ok with everything or enough backlash that they extend the season. 
---
So far we don’t know how useful the double exp and score weekends will be but we do know that they are crucial for completion of the season if you aren’t earning 30k xp per day.
---
I hate the 30 minute survival ones. because sometimes you can last 15 minutes, others you get ganked right at the start and then have to sit in the main menu/vault for about 5 minutes to pick a map and hope you dont die right off the spawn again.
---
This has been an issue for over a year. They've had ample time to fix it
---
You can’t get FFR and E on the same gun.
---
Thank you, how do I message you?
---
Loved the video!  Entertaining and also informative.  We need more content like this in the community
---
33% vats I believe not on now but I'll check later
---
They appear when completed.
---
Although there is a bug that awards it at 3/5 rather than 5/5 so you may have already had the points?
---
I got one after doing the daily today.
---
Train car diners are pretty classic Americana...
---
Fallout 1st is Bethesdas worst attempt at a bungie level cash grab since the game came out
---
If it was half the price i would consider it but £100 for a year is rediculous for a broken service that constantly has issues
---
And yes whilst i agree completing the event is the goal, mine is getting the garunteed legendary spawns, no clue what you mean regarding a legendary creature route as thats something i havent come across yet
---
And ive already done the fasnatch and arktos events and the people in those with randoms were not only polite but let players tag legendaries and gave player a chance to actually do something
---
Starting next week, 150 atoms per rank.
---
26 so I'm not too pissed but it's still a kick in the nads
---
Sorry you came across this absolute sausage. 
---
Shame really it’s against the rules to share IGN.
---
There should be a semi vindictive revenge sub for 76 where a council of mods reads accounts from vicitms, ensures the accused is guilty and then rain down he’ll fire on every piece of his gameplay. 
---
It could start with slowly walking behind him in a clown suit everywhere he goes and get weirder and more psychological as it goes
---
Not griefing just being the most annoying we all can be. Like those excellent dev tools that activate in games like the Witcher when a player cheats 
---
I feel like baby shark will be involved somehow
---
EDIT: This is giving me a great creepypasta idea
---
I love Fallout, I have never like the nuka cola theme stuff. I dont like the color red.
---
It makes no difference. Why should a lot of people lose there stuff just because you got your ass kick in a pvp zone?
---
Sometimes I put Beckett in it but I’ve stuck to having all my Mistress items in a display case on my main character
---
VATS keeps rolling those natural 1s
---
That’s patently false. They do hot fixes to correct issues all the time. There are plenty of legit criticism of Beth and the game; no need to make stuff up.
---
Unfortunately i only have it on pc as my main, got it on xbox when wastelanders came out but never made my first character on that platform
---
for a time NW was a free to play add on and starting in a few days the whole game goes free to play via xbox game pass. NW gets a daily and weekly. its an add on for the retail of fallout 76 there is zero reason to double the amount of score since its just an add on for the full game. what next you want score only for private servers. if you asked me NW shouldn't get any SCORE as its a separate add on. but seing as how easy the daily is to complete i dont really care. but in the end i do not see them adding extra score t oa single game mode. just to suit those who only want to play pvp.
---
Well the constant crying won't end. If they add more to NW and to adventure, adventure players will still complain they're being forced to do NW for that extra score lmao.
---
I wanted the Bow skin. Thankfully got that already in the first week.
---
Ive been trying to find pics of new items for today but haven't found any. Guess i need to wait till after work. :\
---
Must be a solo pacifist player who accidentally picked a workshop lock.
---
You should be sorry for the retribution you've set into motion. /s
---
But they only did this *because* you had a bounty, it's not personal. It's pretty well known that anyone with a bounty is considered free game - no matter the level. We are encouraged to hunt down people with bounties. Unfortunately you ran into people who didn't let you keep the loot. 
---
There are a lot of games out there where new players are treated like crap and constantly killed before they can even leave the starting area. So thank goodness this game isn't like that - this community has a surprisingly nice player base all things considered.
---
They already "fixed it" according to the patch notes. Turns out they just broke it for more people.
---
You are correct i believe it’s faster reload not fire rate. My bad.
---
I'll do my best to keep them coming. Glad you liked it.
---
I smell burnt toast.
---
Thank you I was wondering why I couldn't buy them
---
Me
---
Because I didn't have the CC thing
---
I've had legacies and traded most of them away because they really aren't as good as you think and they break quickly.  But I agree, they should be removed the game or fixed.  The cheating and duping has just made a separate class of players that insta-kill everything and ruin the multiplayer aspect of the game.  Content will never be balanced around them, so either they need to be rebalanced and reimplemented or removed.
---
I'll just add that I would assume when they do the one wasteland patch this will likely happen then or probably never.
---
I managed to do it 30 mins before the reset and my challenges are fine.
---
Agree.
---
Autism or depression pick one.
---
You don’t owe online strangers anything and they don’t owe you anything either. Seems like you’re just bitching. There’s a mute button.
---
Okay. Well good luck with your desires. You will probably keep being disappointed as it doesn’t seem like you’re very open minded about a game that has a plethora of customization options. Nuka cola quantum isn’t red. Just sayin.
---
I believe you meant initiating and not imitating
---
Looks like a weapon bench. But it’s also not.
---
It changed when this industry became a billion dollar industry. Attracted big buisness and they stuck their grubby hands in it. Really it's our fault for spending money on this new system.
---
Orrrrrr..  they had to grind for xp like you suggested people do in another comment?
---
Getting shellshock from a wild dog whacking it’s head against my thick metal kneecaps
---
this is what week 2 of 10? with a double xp and double score event coming. i doubt they will just auto complete a 10 week event over a glitch that they can just as easly say just go buy atoms and get the missing levels. atm bethesda is just riding the clock till the game his Game pass next week
---
Yes i agree
---
All the roleplayers on this subreddit and they can't comprehend someone role playing an evil faction.
---
I guess that's right. Consider yourself muted then.
---
It happens unfortunately. If you learn their spawn spots, camp out at one and take it all for yourself if you see people melting them without waiting for others. Give them a taste of their own medicine.
---
I got lucky last night and decided to skip the nuke drop. A few minutes after the queen spawned, Uranium Fever popped. I did the whole event solo. Got crap for legendaries but it felt good to solo it.
---
Honestly, if you even show up to the event you should completely participate. That person was being a turd.
---
I wasn't aware this was a problem until today so I didn't know to log out, and I lost 5,000 score. Sent in a support ticket and was told they are aware of a problem but can't give out the lost score. :(
---
It would balance out the game. By the way it was a draw.
---
And we still don't have the marine or combat armor of the fallout 1st camo.
---
Is in „The Unstoppables!“ the red/white pipboy?
---
Pvp = serial killer
---
Got it.
---
ditto
---
I've moved it multiple times and it still doesn't change where I spawn
---
Yeah, wires are just so intrusive. If floors and walls could be powered to then pass the power onto objects on them, it'd make camps look a lot neater.
---
As a high level that also likes to run uranium fever, I tag the legendary then call everyone over with an emote usually the next player come and instkills but at least try to let everyone get a hit in
---
I mean i was kinda kidding. He took it too far regardless. Oh thanks 4 downvote who ever you are.
---
You think instantly being killed is a draw or your original post was bullshit?
---
Is it an actual vending machine?
---
It wouldn’t hurt to submit a ticket It all depends on the person who handle your claim 
---
As it a customer service job
---
more people to buy all the plans ive stockpiled since day 1. &lt;evil laugh&gt;
---
I agree just everyone who attempts to grief I just see nothing but Legacies.
---
For the past 5 days with server hoping i havent been able to do the belly of the beast quest step with glassed cavern as every time i get around to doing it a nuke drops with that location in the blast radius
---
Gets irritating fast so i started to farm events and the wastelanders stuff, now uranium fever isnt an option either
---
I'll try moving it again with that in mind and let you know how it goes edit:spelling error
---
Look forward to seeing you out in the wasteland
---
He killed me twice &amp; I killed him twice.
---
Yeah it has a super cute animation. So does the clock and the light sign.
---
Probably a dumb question but if you deploy camp in nw does it affect your camp in adventure? Want those score points but not if i have to rebuild my camp
---
I appreciate the emotes, just annoys me that its a level 25 event and people feel the need to go overkill with their gear
---
Haha best reply so far just crispy
---
It is!
---
lel
---
i forgot about that one, for that i just used a character ive never played NW on to get the easy rank ups. Also how i do my level ups, brand new character
---
Damn thats pretty cool! Thanks for the answer ;)
---
\[A tangential implementation post\]  
---
As a software developer, I'm fascinated by the possible mechanisms they could have used to implement the perk / mutation / consumables system.  Almost every calculation in the game has to support multiple modifiers, be fast enough to do in realtime, and allow modifiers to be stacked and removed easily.  
---
For each shot of a gun, the damage per shot gets modified by perks, the type of weapon being used, the type of creature targeted, armor penetration, damage type, and limb damage (to name a few).  
---
I'm not at all surprised it gets a little buggy.
---
I don’t think it would hurt them there are still cosmetic items that people will find cool enough and pay.  
---
The red rocket power armor skin I found that cool as hell and fork up $20 in atoms because I wanted too , not because I’m force too
---
finally something new :) will have to see it tomorrow unfortunately
---
Nope, I've played lots of games. Like civ. And XCOM. And the Total War franchise. Thought of myself as exclusively a strategy gamer until I picked up the complete edition of Skyrim for $15 and that got me into open world RPG's. I also enjoy space sims.
---
One of the things about Bethesda is that their games are incredibly broad, so they appeal to lots of different people with different tastes in games. Which means, yes, a bunch of people who are coming to this as a Bethesda game first and an online game second.
---
They do have set spawn spots but it's random in which order. When you hear "detecting terminated management personal" drop what you're doing and get to one of the spots. One of them is the first hole in the wall you see right when you enter the event by the red exit sign above the door. Another one is up at the top in the hole that's near a console. The third spot can change but you're guaranteed to see three in the event.
---
[new quests are coming in the fall](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6uGykyguCRz6hvvNUhZ5f0/61fd56348e4350f5ca4eb3106752fd13/F76_2020_Roadmap_FULL-SIZE.png)
---
Careful what you wish for, the quest may leave with the season like d2
---
Thanks. I haven't played much NW, really only started playing more because of these challenges. It's been a while since I moved my camp in the regular game, so I was trying to press V like I do whenever I want to edit my camp.
---
I give upvotes. It's the BOS flairs who downvoted you. It always is.
---
I am embarrassed to admit I am considering subbing for 1 month. I just don’t have that much time to play so don’t think it’s worth it. Does it say how long it is available?
---
Got it. Well like I said just grab a couple buddies and doing on a private.
---
I remember one time I beat a free play squeaker to death with my bare hands (he wanted to brawl) and then he went on a 15 minute tangent about wanting to eat me while I continually killed him trying to get revenge on me
---
I scrapped one of these a month ago before I knew it was rare! xD
---
Yeah but missing out due to a bug is different
---
I found an enemy I just under two shot. So three but after 2 it had a sliver. So when tenderizer procs I can kill it with the 2nd shot.
---
I've found that tenderizer is working but appears to be occasionally inconsistent or it takes multiple seconds to proc.
---
Any chance there's mods out there for them?
---
It used to be 5k when it first launched lol.
---
Do yourself a favor and buy them in 9 weeks when the season is coming to an end. Each tier requires more score than the tier before. Might as well try and earn some. 
---
Or buy them in a week if you like spending money. Lol
---
assuming you mean the xp repeatable, that's always been there
---
I did it in 10 minutes before end! 5 workbench in 10 minutes. The last one was finished on last seconds. Great feelings!
---
So far this hasn’t happened to me yet. I have only done a handful of the events but luckily the higher levels that have shown up have let the lower level guys have their fun until time gets low and then they finish it off. 
---
It will suck when it does finally happen.
---
If you're worried about getting a tag on a legendary, use an automatic weapon and VATS.
---
Most people just don’t know how to use the different power connectors. You can hide wires pretty well if you want to. Wall pass through conduit is a great tool. You can literally run conduit all along the ceilings or walls of your house and then just connect wires right at the point you need them to connect to something. Figure people would know all of this by now since unfortunately all anyone cares about anymore in this game is camp building and cosmetics.
---
T.y. for havin a good comment i did not notice there was 1 added im lvl 32 on my score rank already so im not too worried about completing it on time
---
No always, but most of the time. Like around 20-50% wouldn’t you agree?
---
Correct, heavies need the magic mod and either 200+ fire rate OR 100 fire rate + explosive (to double the hits).
---
Yup. I will always tank whatever pylons need to be tanked when I show up, no matter who put the card in because I run a full health build and know that I can stay alive. I'd rather waste some stims which I always have more than enough of than have someone try to take the pylon and keep dying. Now, if I take all three, the other players better kill the imposter quick.
---
Revive a player I don’t even try. Kill creatures took me way longer then it should have, it’s like the critters knew they were being hunted and despawned lol
---
Yeah, I had a vault Slocum as well. Also had 45 people in the vault and they liked to hang out in Slocum's all day as well.
---
Out of curiosity i stayed in the match when I did this, the number of players who simply disconnected or "died" without a killer was amusing, 52 player server down to 20 in 2 minutes xD
---
I built a vendor and just did a mothman dance on top of it until the fire caught up.
---
This was amazing! This pleases my heart strings
---
I have 1480 atoms right now. I just logged in and really want all the Slocums Joe bundle. It cost 1500 atoms. Before I would be able to do my dailies and buy it. Now since I am level 1 on the Score that means I have no way to jsut make 20 atoms. I'm sad.
---
Having a brotherhood of steal tattoo is one way to get on a police watch list
---
Oh god...... i literally feel sick when i hear that tune. That melody was designed by CIA to activate sleeper agents in the gaming community.
---
Any other Michiganders realize the name is slocum's Joe because they've been callingbit Slocum Joe's the whole time in that Michigan make every brand that is alsona name possessive kinda way?
---
I would make sure to submit a ticket
---
You're safe to drop your C.A.M.P in NW, it is completely separate from Adventure.
---
I plan on getting as much score as my schedule allows i just want to make sure I can get all rewards
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Just like in regular survival. I was just as confused at first
---
Wish that train car wasn't part of that bundle. I don't want any of Slocum Joe's stuff. Lame
---
Prior to reading this post, I had no idea i already stacked 31 alpha and bravo key cards.. damn. HAHAHAH!
---
It really isnt.
---
If the BoS update doesn't come with new quest lines I think that'll be the end of FO76.  Bethesda barely has their head above water right now with community support. 
---
I'm enjoying the game and I'm neutral on seasons at the moment (it's fine). Doing a disservice to something as beloved as the Brotherhood is a kiss of death.
---
Doesnt effect your base in the main game. Nw is a separate mode
---
The one from the Season
---
Dances and plays some music.  
---
It stops dancing for a few seconds and starts up again.
---
anyone know the outfit show on the headgear? its different from the outfit we got
---
i dont really get what the train car is doing in the slocum joes bundle but ok.
---
Atoms is a currency they don’t care what you do with it they give you a few for free one but the idea is to spend it and impulsive buy more.  Now you might say you will never impulsive buy stuff at the atom shop but you aren’t everyone 
---
They only need a % of the total playerbase to buy stuff , but the longer you play fallout76 the more likely you are to buy atoms 
---
Or fallout 1st 
---
Bethesda know what they are doing
---
Just wait, it will likely be broken up in a few weeks and you will be able to buy it in its own.
---
Aqua boy, spawn in the lake. Guaranteed at least 3-5 mins from pure afk
---
Wait...whys that lol
---
Ooph really I already bought it
---
There are zero plasma caster skins it seems. Its like they don't want money.
---
Can I upvote this multiple times? Also, what gives with all the holotapes. Once you hear it once, it should not be in your search wheel.
---
I wonder what is meant by Earn Scaling rewards. Just based on character level?
---
There's conflicting information on this subreddit about whether it works with explosive legendary effects, but I've always ran it on my heavy gunner though as I also use missile launchers, grenades, and grenade launchers as well. Note I don't have any legacy weapons so I can't test personally but bigger boom is always nice, especially with blooming explosion legendary perks coming soon.
---
Yea so hard to make a new toon or go on an alt and get a level for staying alive for 2 mins /s
---
I only do it because I keep hearing about how some people are getting the rare and lucky drop of a rare outfits bundle. They're claiming it's giving them the Whitespring and BOS jumpsuits, a scout mask and other rare items all in one go. I hope that's a hidden prize that's intentional from Bethesda and not a bug they'll nerf.
---
They hot fix critical issues, like bugs that break limited time events (Fasnacht hotfix) or duping exploits. Hate to say it, but Adrenaline being broken isn't an issue that warrants pushing out an unscheduled patch. There's a nonzero chance we get a small update in July that fixes some bugs before the next major patch on the calendar, but it's likely that we'll all have to adapt to playing without Adrenaline for the next month.
---
Argh, I have so many key cards from doing battle bots during the dumb mole miner event. I never know what’s in my misc. anymore because of those.
---
90% sure that tenderizer is busted. or at least doesn't change damage numbers if it isnt broken
---
An added bonus: each item in your inventory slows down your game a tiny bit. Having all the keys/keycards/passwords makes this game run very slowly, even with no other items in your inventory.
---
If the devs aren't planning on addressing this, at least convince them to ***stop adding more keys to the game.***
---
Already done.
---
You got lucky, ive noticed not many people go near monster mash anymore, definitely worth it exp wise, no clue what the candy rewards give me though
---
It seems whenever I jump over to Freddy's House of Scares there is always either a glowing ghoul or wendigo sitting outside. I'll probably head there first thing.
---
Nw has quite a few
---
Assuming you read my comment, you should have figure out i already knew that it has always been there.
---
I have a set of three different blueprints that I use for workshops, one which has a foundation and an enclosed fusion generator, one which has all my workbenches in a small structure and one which is a turret stand. All have power pylons on them so I just place them down and string them up and have a fully functioning compound with everything I need in about 1 minute. I've thought about doing something like this with mobile camps but I love building elaborate camps too much.
---
Yeh I don't want any duped presents , I spent money so I could play the game. I'll enjoy it my way.
---
Finally... someone with the guts to put something different in the FO 1st section.
---
I caught him walking around outside of Foundation.  Like, 100ft down the slope. Just meandering
---
I guess. My meter didn’t move. It was the first time doing the challenge.
---
I somehow got the Claim 5 Workshops before the reset (yay for 1k free SCORE)
---
Lakeside Cabins, Wade Airport, Charleston Dump, the Power Plant in Charleston and Billings Homestead, took me about 5 minutes, and 5 events about 5 minutes afterwards!
---
Thanks for the heads up, ill try running through blackwater mine solo without the event and get used to running to each of the possible spawns
---
Appreciate the info
---
Sounds like you need to join the bush hiding gang.
---
we will probably have to wait till next major patch.. 3-4 weeks away as per usual
---
Hell yes. I can't believe this has not been addressed in 2+ years!
---
That's the harness underarmor.
---
Can you put it on top of a rug then move the rug onto the foundation? Maybe a workaround.
---
Dupe glitches yes, sneak was broken for two months after wastelanders dropped.
---
&gt;And yes whilst i agree completing the event is the goal, mine is getting the garunteed legendary spawns, no clue what you mean regarding a legendary creature route as thats something i havent come across yet
---
You should not be expecting a guaranteed legendary at an event.  A better plan is to hit up instances that typically spawn 1-3 legendaries at a time, for example Fort Defiance.  You can go in, clear out ghouls, hopefully get a couple of legendaries, then drop out of the server, server hop, lather rinse and repeat. 
---
&gt;And ive already done the fasnatch and arktos events and the people in those with randoms were not only polite but let players tag legendaries and gave player a chance to actually do something
---
The only time I have ever seen everyone getting a chance to tag a legendary is in the event that the legendary was tough enough to not be one or two shot.  The only time I got to tag the Megasloth was when I could chuck a grenade and hit it as it spawned.  
---
It’s far more efficient To simply specifically hunt down legendaries, and if you only care about the Scrip value of it, there are some good hunting Grounds in lower level zones
---
I know this is irrelevant to your post, and I’m very sorry, but I have to ask since this is a NW thread. Is NW extremely laggy and clunky to anyone else? I play adventure mode exclusively (I’d rather play apex or fortnite for battle royale) and it is not like that, for me at least. I know the game as a whole has its bugs, sometimes game breaking, but adventure mode at least runs semi smoothly for me. On NW any time I move or shoot the frames drop like a nuke and it’s pretty much unplayable for me and idk how people put up with that. Is it like that for anyone else? I wouldn’t think it’s my internet connection because everything else runs fine for me, no lag. I’m just curious if that’s just how it is or am I extremely unlucky and keep getting on the worst servers.
---
So you would get a tattoo from a video game after only recently being introduced to it?
---
That seems just outright stupid, sorry.
---
Issue is reaching the target before it dies to even tag it, an automatic weapon only counts if i can reach it in time
---
Keep waiting, you'll get it in 2022
---
Most Fallout First items are there for a month before they go away.
---
I kept the NW daily as the last of the 5/5 dailies. When i completed it in NW,since the "do 5/5 dailies"  is also visible in NW,it gave me credit for that for the 3/3 NW weekly.
---
I will be back when it's fixed. I've played through lots of broken content since this games come out, I'm not putting myself through this mess. Time to take a break.
---
That’s my question at this point, I always assumed that it worked all the time regardless what you were doing.  I hope they clarify this and all the other perk bugs.
---
I didn't play for over 10 hours before reset and waited an hour after and over half my weeklies and all my dailies except 2 are auto completed. It seems being logged in is A cause but not the only trigger.
---
The patriotic salute was meant to be a Tricentennial exclusive. It was only a bug that everyone had it, and with update 20 it was removed from the emotes of anyone who didn't have the Tricentennial edition of the game or the bundle from the store.
---
Over my dead body. I'm not willing to sacrifice part of my experience to make yours more pleasant when you could easily change your situation nor should I have to.
---
I expected the 3 legendaries due to the event i was doing, and as for instances that spawn them, ive run through fort defiance and its usually filled with trash mobs or cleared out by the time i get there
---
What hunting grounds would you personally recommend as whatever i can learn from this post the better really as ill have to pass this info onto my friend
---
Might have been what happened for me as well.
---
No need to be sorry its your opinion
---
Whenever I try to press (E) to craft it says “waiting for response from server, please stand by” if that helps
---
Dupers ruined value of most rare plans a few months ago, anything more than a couple hundred caps may as well be theft.
---
They should make the scrap box account wide or add a “bank” character with upgradable inventory space via cap for account wide stuff
---
They already delayed the stuff that was initially planned this month. There is no way they are going to keep those dates
---
Items are only level 35… No reason to ruin the chance for others to tag it.
---
If they didn't do it with a server-side hotfix yet, then it probably needs an update to fix and won't get fixed until update 21 rolls out, which is coming to the PTS this week for an august target date according to their road map.
---
What OP is asking for doesn't really affect adventure players at all. Beth obviously has a max score they want you to get daily/weekly, just cap it and make it achievable through either adventure or nw.
---
Gone..reduced to atoms..
---
just know their spawn points and be quick
---
I bet my life that they wouldnt fix it for 2 weeks so i guess someone owes me a steak n cheese
---
I ended up building my camp near a lead deposit/junk depost, one buddy built his on an acid deposit, and the 3rd built his on an iron deposit. Weve been sitting pretty on ammo save for the stuff that takes nuclear waste.
---
So I've moved it again this time paying attention to the layout of my camp and placed it in a way that my buildings weren't in the direction you said and it seemed to have worked for me so far but my friends still keep spawning under the house
---
Ye there are a few in nuclear winter. You unlock a blue camo paint for all power armors by lvl 17 or 18 i think. It looks pretty cool
---
Many things have never been sold individually such as the Greenhouse Dome so its a pretty good chance it would not have been ever offered outside the bundle.
---
&gt;harness underarmor.
---
thanks!
---
If only players pointlessly grinding to 290+ levels realised this
---
Once my build on my current character is complete ill make a fresh one, pointless overleveling one
---
Not to mention i dont want to cause low level players grief by wandering through an area screwing up their spawns
---
Don't PVP if you can't handle PVP.
---
I had the same thing to me happen a awhile back and i dont know if theres anything you can do all i know is i wont quit out without it recalled anymore
---
if that happens again...immediately exit game. turn off xbox and restart it. they should reset
---
Didn’t think of that, though it sucks I made five characters. Oh well.
---
Does this solve it? Because I will do so after this NW match.
---
It aint over til you get one of them pies.
---
Be quicker then a one shot explosive bloodied build, sure sounds resonable
---
There are Perks for sprinting in Power Armor. What’s your Perk Build?
---
I haven't done it much lately, but I used to build a fusion reactor for all my low level teammates. I still hand out water and ammo fairly often, since I can just drop that without needing to be on a team.
---
Did you have issues finding 10mm SMGs? Been saving up for the schematic but I've been trying to find them to scrap for modifications and in the time I've spent getting to lvl 50 I've found maybe 5 total not including my legendary one I got from the purveyor.
---
as if the economy wasnt completely fucked in this game already. in fact the hard cap helped ruin this games economy.
---
Then what's the issue?
---
It would make the game balance and I couldn't change my situation at the time.
---
26, mine have not auto completed and I've done them all, I'm lvl 22. So you are not missing anything
---
Is your Fusion Core used up?
---
yes please
---
-build wall
---
-change to door
---
-run power line through the door
---
-change back to wall
---
Its weird dude ive noticed a bit of an upsurge in toxic chads myself. Did they have a convention or something and decide fo76 was their new target?
---
Overencumbered or no fusion core should be the only reason.  Otherwise it seems u may have a problem
---
Or the definition of “snails pace” should be expanded upon
---
Of course they put the train cart in a bundle unrelated to it and not sold by itself.
---
Do you mean the 10mm or the 45? Because the 45 version has most of what you are talking about.
---
I see people say this over and over but I’m assuming you’re on PC because there never is a surplus of plans on ps4
---
I tend to get stuck in ADS a ton. It could be a possibility that is happening and got stuck.
---
It's not balanced.
---
Yeah, the more likely scenario is that the bundle will come back in a few months for 400 atoms off or something.
---
Ahh nice
---
&gt;NW: Complete a NW daily challenge 0/3
---
lmaooo
---
employee: *sir, we've reviewed feedback and they're absolutely hating having to do NW daily to get the max SCORE. everyone is pretty much just sitting in bushes. what should we do?*
---
John Bethesda: *make it a weekly quest to do them too idk lol*
---
Clearly it is if it was a draw.
---
No fusion core! That’s it. I can’t seem to put a fusion core in though. I’m level 332, and I’ve never come across this before. How weird. Any ideas?
---
Edit- I just found another PA frame and used that. Thanks for your help.
---
He's just looking for someone with the guts to help
---
the train doesnt make any sense being in a bundle
---
I just hit level 25 today. Pretty sure I could have skipped a few days and still been okay.
---
Pick up the module (*just the module, don't move CAMP*) and try placing it at the very edge of your CAMP's buildable zone. Have them travel to Vault 76 and back and see where they spawn.
---
Damn I think your title template is gonna stay the same for a long time.
---
Same as adventure, but its free, takes 5 seconds after entering a match, go do it.
---
I try to use mine but even with a B2515 and BE15 Submachine Gun, they just suck in general (yes, I am using a maxed Commando build with all damage boosts). Even those ones do little damage despite saying they do a ton. They’re really fun, super stable with all the recoil mods on, but they burn through ammo horribly inefficiently
---
I think it just means if you are level 5 and tag the same enemy as a level 50 player, you both will get a weapon scaled to your level.
---
It was a draw because I managed to get away from him before he could get me again, I only used a Grenade Launcher on him
---
There is a pc mod for a reflex sight on the 10mm
---
Quarantine Shmarantine. I'm out and about baby !
---
I’m happy with my purchase of the dancing robot vendor
---
wtf man.
---
this hasn't happened to me yet but fuck i would be pissed if it did. it's seriously ridiculous that they haven't made an official announcement on this, and even more ridiculous that they are likely not going to do anything about it to compensate those affected.
---
I'd also like to know this. Levelling an alt now but want to save some bullion for secret service. Don't want it to go to waste if it won't let you and I'll claim it with my main.
---
For me it was radrats while leveling.
---
WHY CAN A RAT TAKE 5 SHOTGUN BLASTS TO THE HEAD?
---
Now, as a L67 stealth shotgunner. Mole rats are the bane of my existence. Giant L50+ flying monstrosity circling overhead 15 feet above me and not being able to see me *while* i dump round after round into it? NO PROBLEM!
---
L12 molerat that instantaneously aggrod and dangered me from three football fields away and who is now hiding in a hole in the ground and refusing to surface? PROBLEM.
---
I tried it yesterday and it seems to have fixed itself. I logged in and lucky mucker popped up as a daily challenge. The “talk to zeke” part hasn’t been completed, so I was able to start the game and actually finish it. Not sure what happened but it apparently fixed itself after months of being glitched. And I’ve tried this since the last patch so it wasn’t that that fixed it. Hope it works out for you.
---
Did you go to the basement and unlock his terminal from the security office, and then go back up to Sam’s terminal?
---
There aren’t any dates on the roadmap...
---
The point is we will get new quests as part of steel dawn
---
Its so strange to release an event where the main way to progress it is boken and have been for so long. I just dont understand
---
its not really typical to have a hard cap on the total of main currency though. at least not this low, there is always a hard integer limit somewhere but most mmos dont limit the main currency so that people will grind it out for sinks. the daily limits on other stuff is pretty typical though, but this games daily limits could use an adjustment, at least scrip seeing as they made it the core way of getting new weapons and raid armor.
---
i don't think claiming counts. just defending
---
It has music? I'll probably skip then, it gets annoying.
---
If you have a core on you and for some reason it won't install automatically when activating the PA, open the PA's inventory and manually put a core into it.
---
I found him once standing about 20 feet up on a cliff outside foundation, wanders around a lot for someone who is supposed to be sitting at his desk as well
---
This i great, I also say keep and scrap all guns for steel scrap, and if you need plastic the schools and allegheny are good spots.
---
I get it but if you can fast travel to the event and do it then isn’t it, by definition, public?
---
Amen, I plan on avoiding purchases like this. Completed dlc doesn't bother me as much, but the gambling-like minor sales are very annoying. Especially for things that can't be farmed for. I don't mind the grind I just hate this limited time crap forced to buy crap. 
---
I'm encouraging my friends, who like me are adults with lives and are just one day a week players, to not buy into this. We are working on petitions and boycotts. I encourage others to do the same.
---
He’s looking for more ways to get daily rep with foundation
---
Pretty sure Ghoulish isn't working properly, was in a nuked zone with lvl 2 Ghoulish and wasnt regaining any health, radicool seems to be buggy as well and only works some of the time.
---
This actually explains alot....i was wondering why i was feeling a bit gimped lately
---
I had a ton too. It seems they were awarded during some time period for doing regular quests.
---
I don't think he fell asleep there. I think someone got fed up with his snark and shoved him there.
---
Not just a Michigan thing. It's a not paying attention thing that happens everywhere. Sorry to melt your snowflake.
---
I’ve only played NW a couple of times over the past year, then played yesterday to bush wookie and survive for 30 minutes. You can imagine my surprise when the special screen said I had 257 unopened perk packs. I’m not sure if those are really NW perk packs or adventure mode perk packs, but I dang sure had a shitload of unopened perk packs while playing NW yesterday.
---
I found him sleeping in there once too but didn't think to take a picture at the time.  Haven't seen it again since though.
---
Without knowing how much they played you can't know.
---
My character is over 21 and ive not STARTED this week's items yet.  If they've played a lot and leveled up with XP they may have been heading for higher levels.
---
there are usually snallygasters in front of the Kiddie Cabins in Toxic Valley, west of Blackbear lodge.
---
pro tip: there is also a level 35 mirelurk queen that spawns in the middle of the lake to the west of the kiddie cabins. it'll pop up if you swim to the island and let off some rounds or throw a grenade. easy kill for queen meat for the hidden daily raider rep.
---
That’s the spirit! You are free to mute anyone you’d like. Thank you for not making a post about it.
---
Just got the snowflake armour paint, seems like the old rewards are still there!
---
Thank goodness its here for 20 days. I don't get paid again for a small while and I'd have been really sad if I'd missed this stuff. Settlement building is my all-time weakness
---
I also recommend finishing any atom challenges you have left
---
Because Bethesda already had the seasonal cosmetics done and ready to go before the game even launched 
---
At the moment most of the dev time was most likely spent on Wastelanders itself and the upcoming Brotherhood of Steel content
---
What does it sell?
---
I dont know the answer. But you could just not claim it until you finish the raid. There are 9 weeks left to claim it. Probably 10 or 11 honestly.
---
NPC vendors, Scrip machine and Bullion machine reset 20 hours after first use from last they reset.
---
Only one way to find out...
---
It’s a skin for your player vending machines!
---
Ah ok
---
This is why I made a second character. Do the grinding on your main, then experience the lore on your alt.
---
Server hop if you're after a particular item.
---
Thank you. So, do you have to purchase something from them for the timer to begin? Since I normally plan on a private server I can’t rely on someone else to purchase something to start the timer.
---
This has been happening to me for quite some time.  I have looked a little more closely into this.  I am not getting my full magazine.  I usually get 26 rounds of my 30 round clip, though it does not always appear to be 26.  What is happening is for some reason, when firing the number of rounds remaining reduces by 2 instead of 1 when firing single shots.  I have tested this by single firing my automatic rifle.  Additionally, the clip will erroneously show that it has reached 0 and then suddenly show a different number (like 11) right before reloading.  The number that suddenly appears to reload is NOT the number that should be left either.  It's all very Bethesda and I do not expect it to be fixed ever.
---
Thanks. I’ll try that.
---
Because some people like to carry a whole arsenal of weapons, enough to take down a military.
---
1,000000000% . I absolutely can't stand people that do this. Don't get me started on the Faschnat event. I'm level 500 and I purposefully carry around a crap gun for events like this. Just pop the thing a couple of times. Let the lower players have a chance. God forbid you miss out on a legendary Mr. 145. This absolutely needs to stop F76 community.
---
If you have only a few spaces left on the board at the end of the season, spending atoms makes sense, but if you’re more than like 10 spaces away from the end, the return on investment sucks compared to just spending those atoms in the atom shop.  I guess bragging rights are worth a lot though so I could be wrong.
---
Once you get to a certain level and get your build right it's kind of hard not to one shot anything that's why I always bring a low level weapon
---
I can’t believe you lost your nuka tapper saves, ugh
---
Great idea because I want to see what sort of horror shows managed to survive in the radioactive waters of the wasteland.
---
New 3 star legendary: Fish in a large lake, power armor on, you struggle and manage to pull up a behemoth of a fish.  You aren't fishing anymore. Battle ensues.
---
The question is, what do you name a 3 star legendary fish? 
---
Aaaaaaand, go!
---
Tried that, but it didn’t work. Very strange. Still, it’s fixed now. I’m really impressed by how quickly people responded to this question.
---
Finally someone that doesn't mouth breath the words get on my level for a level 25 event
---
Its why i dont event try the sheepsquatch one yet
---
Stash the cards at home.
---
Ah, that makes sense. TY!
---
There was a bug a few months back that awarded packs for quests. Just open them and enjoy the free xp! Make sure you cash in any overseer tickets as well
---
OK, so why is that then?
---
I have a close up weapon and then I have a long range weapon.  Maybe I have a backup in case something breaks.  I see little benefit to having additional back up weapons.
---
Putting power connectors and wiring on the roof is a good way to hide them too. Doesn't work for really tall buildings but it's how I hide most wires.
---
Still waiting for red tire walls or fish lamp unless they're gone forever, there is literally nothing else in the atom shop cycle i want
---
I predicted this exact Easter egg in 2017, everything has been foreshadowing it for so long, that shrek/noodles combo had to come alive sooner or later
---
LOG CABIN BUNDLE MY TIME IS NOW
---
It’s pretty straightforward in its utility, but certainly more appealing for players who carry heavy weapons, such as a super sledge or a gattling laser. 
---
Like you, I carry three weapons only, so wwr isn’t high on my list, but my buddy hauls around a gattling laser, a gattling plasma, a plain old ballistic gattling gun, and more. I don’t really understand why he needs all that stuff, but for a player like him, wwr is a highly sought after perk.
---
Im stopping around level 65 as i messed my build up, should of only taken me till level 57 but screwed up a few perks when i was playing early morning
---
After that ill just make a new character and when content hits that requires a good build and gear ill alt out
---
No I got my glowing skeleton outfit last night!
---
And I’m saying you shouldn’t, at least not expect to be entitled to a drop from them.  It’s a public event.  Not everyone understands how tagging works, or sometimes don’t even intended to one shot, and in something like Uranium Fever where people are running all about it can be a pain in the ass to make sure everyone gets to tag it while still keeping the machines running. 
---
People feel entitled to drops from legendaries at the event simply because they spawn and they were there, and I’m saying that belief is wrong.  
---
And fort defiance is wonderful for legendary hunting, you run in, clear out the ghoul side in about 10 minutes tops, on average getting a 3\* level 62 ghoul per run (sometimes none, sometimes up to 3), server hop to do it again.  It’s also a great place for chems and stimpacks since ghouls have such a wide range of drops, I can easily come out of there sitting on a stack of over 200 stimpacks to sell.  
---
West Tek, The Gallaria, RobCo - any one of those is a good instance for server hoping for legendary hunting.
---
It seems to give out after you let up off the trigger.. I’m test that theory out later. 
---
As for the people missing their 95% shots - try sitting/standing still. I miss a lot when I’m on the move but hit more often when I’m stationary.
---
Lmao, no it wouldn't. You don't even need one to melt the queen in 10 seconds and pvp in general is a complete joke. There's a reason it's slowly being removed.
---
I've never had atoms show on the same day. It's always like 2 days later.
---
I feel like you're equating F76 PVP to all PVP games, which you shouldn't. Also, I'm nominating you to the FBI watch list.
---
Christmas outfit? What is that
---
FYI
---
I believe the word you mean is lose. Although, loose kinda fits too as the Score points have been set free.
---
Anybody got some atoms to spare? Im too poor :^(
---
It is still bugged if you didn't find out yet, just got my last christmas reward.
---
Without a doubt the cutest thing I've ever seen. I'm loving this whole bundle.
---
What does it do? Is it like a vendor machine? More detail please?
---
At some point, you just have to stop caring.  Some people will be selfish jerks and not share, because that's simply how they are.  And often, calling attention to that only emboldens them to do it more, because they aren't wired for empathy.
---
Ok, Todd!
---
Agreed. I would also like some smaller versions (like a tabletop version - maybe a cash register?)
---
and/or versions where one machine holds all of your items for sale so you don't need 4 of them. 
---
These big honkin' things make building the way I want to kinda difficult.
---
A cute little 1950s rolodex would be awesome
---
Friendly reminder that the water fountain that you drink out of on white springs take them away. It's right next to the gazebo. But I agree with OP
---
Might depend on what platform you are playing it on I guess; however you should get a standard 1650 atoms each month.
---
Some people have 50 pairs of trainers in their wardrobe to choose from, I have 50 guns to use according to my mood that day - don't judge me.. 😂
---
Dude lol you really, like REALLY FUCKING MISUNDERSTOOD my shit. And I don't owe you to waste my time. 
---
Calm the fuck down, John Wayne.
---
You shouldn't be able to melt the Queen in 10 seconds.
---
Yes it's an actual vending machine you put your items in to sell. It plays new music and dances!
---
If I am one level behind can I still get to 100 by the end of the season or if I miss a day or something?
---
The monetary amount resets 20 hours after you purchase or sell something. Only you.  No one else.  Inventories are player based. You can server hop to try for different items.
---
I think they did it, because when people saw the caboose before Season 1 started everyone was like damn I want that caboose, my self included. Easy way to get someone to spend more to get the one item they wanted.
---
Fucking brotherhood of steal stole my Nuka tapper saves.
---
I can agree with this, especially with the score from XP leveling me while im fighting things and I cannot see a goddamn thing because it has to show me that I have unlocked a new thing.  Great. Nice.  But I'd like to not die here, thanks.
---
No it’s from when you make the purchase, everyones timer will be different.
---
You're talking shit right f'n now........ 
---
And now you're on the spot. Explain WTF is wrong with adults playing GTA. While I turn that shit on.
---
I wish they would just delete all the traps an give us the fast travel mat.
---
It's a personal timer. It's started from first purchase or item you've sold to it. Every day I always keep one legendary on me to feed the scrip machine, sell a corn soup or water to an NPC vendor and buy my bullion as soon as I get on to make sure they always reset for when I get on the next day.
---
Well yeah I guess but in this case public means it's free to fast travel to.
---
Thanks bro, much obliged.
---
To get people to spend atoms they saved up = people buy more to grab levels in the season crap. Bugthesda is as moneygreedy as all other companies, but alot more pathetic with fixing the game
---
Hmm.. so Is he one of those rare players using heavy weapons but no PA?
---
A super sledge isn't that heavy, especially considering that if you go melee you should really have martial artist.
---
Just ran west tek and didnt get any legendaries unfortunately
---
Also if people go into an event with the express intention of getting legendary drops from a garunteed spawn, how is that wrong, thats the equivalent of me saying that as its a level 25 event anyone above level 25-30 shouldn't be allowed to participate
---
And sorry but i call bullshit on people not knowing what tagging is, the game shows your early on that to get any exp or items from a kill, you either need to be in a team (exp still requires tagging) or to outright get a good hit or two on the enemy
---
Sorry but i dont believe for a second that someone who is level 120+ doesnt know this mechanic
---
Just a heads up, the special door that comes with the bundle for the train car does NOT work on any other walls or pre fab buildings. It slides into the walls of the train car.
---
Also the lights on the side of the train car also don't work.
---
Same here, with high int mentats buff and xp ones. Doing 3 queens getting 3k+ exp from each event completion. I grinded a ton too. Still haven't missed or auto complete score stuff.
---
I'm one of those people! In my case it's just for fun. I really enjoy my collection of melee weapons and like to switch things up frequently. I got bored of playing for efficiency a long time ago.
---
WWR is useful for farming steel, can clear westek without being over encumbered. 
---
Other than that a lot of use have mules with 100+ weapons
---
Ive seen that across several comments in this post already, including people saying players are entitled just for wanting legendaries from an event that garuntees three of them
---
And unfortunately i have to care when I'm trying to gear up not only my character but my friends as well as they dont have as much time to play as i do
---
Rifles have no weight reduction perks, other weapons that do could easily have perks freed up. Also makes life easier when you have limited stash space. Pretty simple to be fair.
---
I think its supposed to be a train car diner
---
mule alts
---
I have 80% wwr on one of mine and they're carrying a LOT
---
Pistol build here
---
I would prefer a bio card for a shortcut to the control room. Too many times I waste all my ammo taking on robots that I barely have any to fight the SQ. Frustrating.
---
Guess there are ways around it and I'd prefer a fix to the horrid amount of micro transactions.
---
Good. Im not going insane then.
---
It’s not that no one uses them because there’s no attachments for them. It’s because automatic weapons in this game are garbage, even if you use an automatic build. The only good automatic weapon in the game besides the heavies is the gamma gun.
---
I kind of regard it the same way I do "Carl's Jr."  A weird use of the possessive, but not wrong.
---
I'm level 24 and have only been on a couple of hours a day, not lost any score (yet)
---
I can see people specifically grinding XP and not have work/school commitments being easily 30+ even with lost score.
---
Sorry, I'm french, and we all know frenchs are bad at english... (and we're also bad at french!)
---
It’s a skin
---
I really wish they'd include the \_walls\_ for the diner, Red Rocket, and Slocum Joe. I'd love to build a diner in my camp.
---
Ngl, i kinda like when someone takes the bounties off me. Cuz then im not targeted anymore.
---
It’s paint for the armor I thunk
---
Recoil is uncontrollable. That’s the first thing that needs to be fixed.
---
Im carrying 9 different weapons on me atm but i just enjoy the variety but i main black powder weapons and heavy weapons and pistols with a little mixed in on melee :) i just like alot of different weapons
---
I believe it's a paint for that armor type.  Not a separate, creatable armor.
---
So I am at 1480 atoms. The bundle is 1500. I am level 1 on the score. I don't have a way to get 20 atoms today huh...
---
Not if your stealth build. . 😉. silencer on automatic weapons with a stealth build    .. Perfection. 
---
I encourage you to try it. Make sure all commando cards are maxed and you are running the proper cards.
---
I hear ya but the is no level cap you can keep leveling and rearrange then I didn't have a build planned until I was in the high 70s and finally found something I liked
---
I don't think rifles have a weight reduction perk.  I'm a shotgun build but looking to add a gatling laser to my arsenal for the queen. I want it to have WR so I can carry it at all times without wasting the perk space for Bear Arms or whatever it is that reduces weight on heavies.
---
One more. 
---
I had to look at your profile to see where the animosity towards ME was coming from. Yeah. You take games way more seriously than I do. 
---
So now that things are clarified, can you please drop it? 
---
Still laughing at that GTA line. I don't judge people for playing Minecraft or Fortnite... Like please man. Save your time and rage, lmao.
---
Ok buddy let’s not go tooo far
---
LOL ok, fair enough.  To each his own, I seem.to be getting down-voted perhaps for sounding judgy.  Mostly just want to make sure I'm not missing something.  
---
Weapon weight I think affects AP cost, so I thought maybe I'm missing out
---
Can't speak for others, but i'm often weighed down by scrip fodder - armour is dealt with using a perk card but there is no sweeping reduction for weapons using one card - hence why i use a couple of WWR pieces instead.
---
Finally, been waiting for that new Fallout 1st outfit and the train car. Shame it is part of a bundle only, but I got spare points I earned up overtime so whatever.
---
Dev creating location:
---
"OK now to just slide this over into the corner and....where...where did it go? It's not on the roof, maybe the ground outside...no? Uh, well ok I guess I'll figure it out later."
---
How is that entitlement i would rather work hard to earn that 1000 than do something easy u must have a weak core if i shook you
---
Yeah, I build small camps usually. I don’t care much for building elaborate mansions. But usually that’s what I do. Just one power pylon on the roof and it powers my whole house. But when I do want to build something nicer, I usually run conduit. It can be finicky and tedious to use. It looks better to only have to run 1 or 2 feet of wire rather then 10 feet though.
---
Ooh nice
---
I was more like ‘we requested a train car. Why did they think we wanted an old west one?’
---
I looked at the exp rates for leveling and past a set point it gets rediculous
---
Note:
---
levels 50-99 cost 7,880 exp per level exactly
---
Levels 100-999 cost 15,880 exp per level exactly
---
Total cost for levels 2-50 is equal to 197,960 exp exactly
---
Total cost for levels 51-99 is equal to 386,120 exp exactly
---
Total cost for levels 100-999 is equal to 14,292,000 exp exactly
---
Total cost for levels 1,000-50,000 is equal to 7,834,120,000 exp exactly
---
Total cost for levels 2-50,000 is equal to 7,848,996,080 exp exactly
---
This is what i found after a while, and realised it wasnt time worthy since i plan on about 6-7 characters
---
Always down for the PvP.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Sold....once I can get on of course.
---
wouldn't that just be a grenade launcher?
---
Anyone have pics of the interior of the train car?
---
Just don’t be hecka early
---
This is the correct answer. This is how to convert assault rifles and miniguns directly into bullets with ease. It also let's you farm legendaries even after your out of scrip for the day and your low on stash space.
---
None because I don’t log in right when the server resets
---
They are good tag weapons for nuke zone runs.
---
Exactly. My point is that it *was* ready to go, so where is it now?
---
Damn it... hey it was worth a shot
---
Daft Bot
---
Please!
---
And if they did make something like that it would be all 2000 of your points for like 10 ammo, which people would quickly hate, it’s better to farm it and feels more rewarding when you hit that amazing damage
---
I laugh 'cause that happened to me once.
---
Man that Comment Section 101 joke never gets old. You should totally finish up with "it just works."
---
You can use passive mode and enjoy it, or create a private session for your driving experience, but yeah would be great to not be insta killed when you're not interested in PVP.
---
Even better: 
---
* Place poster on wall or small rug on floor (depending on if you want the connector on the wall or floor) within line of site of your generator.  
---
* Place connector on poster/rug and connect a wire. 
---
* Move the poster/rug slightly in order to lock the two pieces together.
---
* Move the poster/rug anywhere you want within wiring range. As long as you have a valid place to place the poster/rug the wire will clip through walls, floors, furniture, the ground, etc.

I use this to discreetly run wires vertically in the corners of a room, onto the roof if needed, or under the ground so my extractors and purifiers don't have random wires dangling everywhere. Once you've got the connector tucked into a corner you can simply hide it behind a potted plant or something.
---
Yeah, I just was trying to avoid spoiling all the changes that came in with wastelanders. I wanted to come across it as I explored without fast travel so switching to an alt and ft’ing defeats that intent. It doesn’t matter much now though, I gave in to FOMO and am ft’ing. This post is just a lament of how sucky it feels.
---
I always thought it was more to help preserve the player economy from inflating to insane levels where a legendary item costs 100,000 caps since they are so easy to get. Scrip is the same thing, legendaries are so easy to get you could spend all day cashing in all the shit legendaries allowing you to keep rolling at the vendor thus increasing the odds of getting a god roll.
---
I can only speak for myself. I'm bloodied stealth commando, so i do not benefit from neither sentinel or cavalier as i'm sneaking if there are enemies around and neither of the two effects work while sneaking. It is extremely rare that i will be standing up and getting hit/shot at, or running away from anything. So i have WWR. One option would be improved stealth but we all know you don't even need sneak perk with high enough agility. Using WWR let's you forget about weight reduce weapon legendary minor effect (and use 25% vats cost reduction or 15% reload speed instead), and weight reduce perks (for gun types that have those). Also, you can haul shittons of weapons for scrapping steel and selling for daily vendor cap. EDIT: Also, there is no perks that reduce rifle weight, those being my choice of weapons. I carry 3 different automatic rifles with me for different situations so they can weight a bit.
---
...oh no... :D
---
Yeah, that’s what I hope I made this player feel, since he wasn’t a real low-level. Wish he gave me a gift back though haha
---
they'll be in a supply cache that you see flying around with vertibird support
---
He's just looking for his multiscope
---
Google is your friend my man
---
Well yea if you plan on doing multiple characters I can see not wanting to do all that, but I'm level 115 or 116 and it takes me maybe an hour or so of running through westek server hoping and doing again to level up so not too bad, I'm running sort of a dual build with heavy guns and melee bloodied of course
---
Lol that's awesome. I'm curious, what's your favorite Swedish band? I want to check them out
---
Wow. Mics work?!
---
That’s awesome! Crafting while playing Nuclear Winter, it’s the new thing.
---
We will. It's an easy swap to make it any counter and any Protectron, so expect to see themed variants in the future.
---
I did some tests with and without it, the speed is the same.
---
Man I bought this for the slocums stuff, made up my diner and then found out there was a train car in there too... Train car diner incoming :)
---
That vendor is excellent by the way.
---
Hated the NW revive 2 player challenge last week. Please don't bring that back again Bethesda
---
Yes and it appeared intact do again this week :)
---
My current one is a mutated melee build with options to swap in rifles for my fixer or a lever action
---
I also use a lot of the sneak and stealth perks as they ramp up the damage really well
---
I did it and got it again for this week. So free 1000 xp.
---
That sucks. I think that, as the game has surged in popularity after Wastelanders, and then being on GamePass, we're going to see more douchebags because there's a higher player count. It's unfortunate. PLEASE report them every time, and then go have fun.
---
Side note - that's really messed up to include family pets.
---
Thanks, I'll add it to the list and I'll try to test it later.
---
That was delightful!
---
One persons experience is not reflective of everyone else. 3 heavy weapons is 60lbs and that's on the light side/without mods. Bad outside PA, even worse in it due to lack of backpack/underarmor/leg effects stats. Without energy ammo weight reduction you almost can't use heavy energy weapons; 2mm, plasma cartridges, and fusion cores are very heavy. 
---
A lot of people who may use sneak or just standard rifle builds don't want weight reduction perks taking up their slots.
---
Vaccinated definitely makes a difference; I was getting diseases every hour before using it and since then, only about one per week (\~20 hours). That said, as a fellow Power Armor user I very much agree with the OP and would rather move those three perk points elsewhere.
---
I wish we had pink sprinkle weapon skins.
---
Never saw anything like that on my last visit to the Underworld.  Just lost my Junk collection.
---
I am mountain time
---
Make sure you get incisor it's great 3 star card the ignores 75% armor for melee
---
Your going to need to have gotten far enough in the enclave questline. Once you reach the rank of general. You will gain acess to the military wing and be able to track them. 
---
If you have allready done above then I believe its the terminal right as you go upstairs past the military wing laser grid. There should be an  option to track key card. 
---
If you haven’t joined the enclave yet. Then finish the main questline or you can jump straight to joining them if you prefer. This is the mission to start them. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bunker_Buster
---
And save this website for when you do launch a nuke. You’ll need silo codes. The codes change weekly and this website is faster then tracking down the code pieces.

I keep a crappy 90% reduced weight just for this.
---
I will be adding 'wankstain' to my repertoire. Thank you.
---
The log cabin. They took it aeay at the same time my 1st atoms dropped and I didnt get a chance to buy. Nows my time.
---
Might buy the slocums joes camp bundle too. Ill see later tonight.
---
There are plenty of challenges still giving atoms in the sections other than daily/weekly. Take a look through them, and hopefully you'll be able to pickup some atoms!
---
Are all of your challenges complete? They recently added some like "kill 76 arthropods" that you may be able to knock out for the difference
---
&gt; Just ran west tek and didnt get any legendaries unfortunately
---
It’s an average, yes you run it once and maybe don’t get any. Then you server hop and find 3.  It’s still going to be faster than hoping a useful event shows up and you can deal with the other people.  
---
&gt; Also if people go into an event with the express intention of getting legendary drops from a garunteed spawn, how is that wrong, thats the equivalent of me saying that as its a level 25 event anyone above level 25-30 shouldn't be allowed to participate
---
Because of the way the game was designed.  The game was originally designed with “some drama between players”, players were expected to race against each other to kill the legendaries first.  Players “tagging” was something counterintuitive to the design.  And it doesn’t even work properly in all cases.   I could “tag” the mega sloth from Fasnatch but still not a reward if I tagged it before it mutated.  
---
And the analogy doesn’t make sense.  The game design of the event, is to go there and complete the event.  Yes legendaries spawn at some events (not all) but they are bonus.  Not every player who is there is entitled to that drop from a legendary.  If you are going there to get them, then be faster on the draw than the other players.  Maybe you just get a tag in and get a drop, maybe you kill it.  
---
the fact is players are exploiting the game mechanic of how who gets drops works.  Which is fine... but again, not an entitlement.
---
&gt; Sorry but i dont believe for a second that someone who is level 120+ doesnt know this mechanic
---
Maybe they know but don’t understand the “common courtesy” that the players themselves started.  Or maybe again, in an event like uranium fever people don’t want to worry about everything else going on and just clear out the event
---
You don’t need sneak perks with high agility? This is news to me!
---
They added stuff for 1st? Hell yeah.
---
Why are you posting this on fanbased sub? Do you honestly think they come where and scroll through all the posts for posts like this? Go to official forums. Or better yet, go to their website and make a ticket.
---
And it worked! I managed to get it at Lewisburg Station. To be honest I’m not sure why I didn’t think of that myself. I must be too used to private servers and not needing to server hop most of the time. Thanks for your help!
---
Exactly. All the power in my camp runs through two gateaway jidden connectors. I have power everywhere and not a single visible wire.
---
Thanks for the advice. I’ll start doing that from now on.
---
Congrats! Hold onto it regardless of temptation. I got one two months ago from a super random solo heart of the swamp and people offered me 80k trade for it and I had many offers. As of yesterday I found one person offering 60-65k trade for one so either more are being rewarded or there is less demand/caps for highrollers and my personal experience since patch 20 is that the economy is depressed atm. Flux has cut in half in under a month, and the same for most in demand consumables and I doubt its because way more people are playing. I used to be able to afk and come back to full stacks of caps from vending and now I am lucky to see a sale once a night. Probably something to do with dwindling population. 
---
I don't trust that legacy weapons will continue to exist forever, and if and when that happens you can kiss your wealth goodbye.
---
Yeah i have incisor, works like a charm, if i remember there was a ranged weapon varient as well
---
Brotherhood of Steal in Chinese lettering actually says Chicken Fried Rice.
---
Yea if you are bloodied and you are at really high agility there is no point using the perk. As agility affects sneaking. You still need escape artist and covert operative etc. But can lose sneak itself.
---
You probably didn't buy it. It was bugged and could be placed in camp without purchasing it.  I added one to my camp and accidentally deleted it during a move.  Now I cant replace it either.
---
I see it as Slocum being the name and Joe being the coffee. Like Slocum's (cup of) Joe.
---
Well either way i appreciate the farming routes, ill give them a shot after ive eaten
---
Too many people don’t get it. Finally someone with guts lol  😃
---
Yesss I’ve been waiting for these!!
---
Do you mind sharing your build with me?
---
Just disable pvp. It has no place in this game.
---
No problem, glad you got it. Now all you have to do is craft and scrap a tonne of them to get the mods!
---
Hmm
---
Is 'everyone' different though?  Sure, having patience and steadily playing through is a rare quality.  Players, me included tend towards rapid rpg char building progression.  Fast forwarding through screens with too much text, roundly ignoring story content elements.  
---
Now, isn't that an opportunity for game design to make us replay content we likely blemmed through.  Instead they throw away their best asset, the post apocalyptic survival struggle. Replacing it with candy crush score ladder.  Replaying the same  events ad nausium.  
---
A season should be another run through with a new character.  What Bethseda have done is nothing less than a insult to gamers and gaming in general.   
---
Every muppet may be a unique muppet, but they're still a muppet.
---
I'm actually a Linguist, and yes, it does happen in many places, but the highest speaker prevalence found in Michigan due to the auto industry and the huge prevalence of Ford factory employees to refer to the compant as Ford's.  Many sociolinguistic trends have acknowledged places of origin despite eventually moving beyond them, such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift.  Like, yes, I am a special snowflake, but about shit like I like everything better when I cook it myself because I'm a good cook or how I buy most accessories in rainbow because I believe rainbows go with everything, not because I have a degree in Sociolinguistic and find it fun to poke fun at the particles I have adopted into my ideolect from the places I live.
---
I played since day 1 and dont remember that. There was a player to player trade max set at 5k once.
---
can't believe how much I enjoyed that
---
This pvp decision REEEEEAAALLY messes up workshop fights.
---
I remember the globe being one the bugged items you could build without buying it - once Bethesda fixed it you could keep any you had built but not build anymore.
---
Just checking this isn't the situation here?
---
Super duper seems to work for some things that used to be affected by it, like crafted armor
---
Have you submitted a ticket to Bethesda? That happened to me the other day with the Raider Waster Bundle and I immediately sent a ticket and thankfully they refunded me.
---
It may be, I actually don’t even recall purchasing it now that you mention it.
---
Hey thanks for the reply - I didn't think about this cause I was too busy being bummed.
---
I still have some visible because the colored lights require a direct connection, but those are all in very clean lines hanging from the ceiling. Other than that, you really can't see the wires connecting my vending machines, extractors, etc.
---
Submit a ticket anyways. The response I got to my ticket gave me a Tiny bit of hope- stated it's a known issue and they are trying to resolve it and fix those affected
---
The brotherhood's history is not always so clean. In fact in most games they vary from pretty murky to outright jerks. 76 does set them up as 'the nice folks' a fair bit though. All I am saying is make sure you check out all the history before you commit to a tatttoo:)
---
Oh thanks for the heads up. I was so bummed I didn't think about this.
---
Figured i would give it a go, occasionally get downvoted to oblivion but occasionally works out
---
Ol’ Ward ain’t quite right.
---
It's not wrong.  If multiple use it and other people understand it, then it is a grammatically correct particle of language.  But it also does stray from the intended reading, like how the internet freaked out when they realized the Bearenstain Bears are spelled like they are.
---
What, no more reese's pieces vomit armor skins? I am disappoint.
---
Yeah, I’m not looking forward to the amount of screws that will take. Still, I’ve already got a good selection of mods for my handmade. For the mid game as I’m around level 33 I like to have a handmade for close fights and a lever gun to act as a sniper rifle which replaces the hunting rifle I’ve used so far.
---
My alt is commando and I cannt afford a big time handmade.....so I carry one of each specialty.
---
If you are decently equipped, it should not take an hour from what I recall

It's not too long, 2 hrs should be enough from what I remember. Take all of the gold, the only "bad" thing that happens is you occasionally hear some NPCs whine about you taking it all.
---
Mmhmmm.  I believe that is the original intention.  I just never noticed till it was written in plain font on my phone.  Hahaha
---
I didn't know that was possible 😲 thank you so much 😊
---
So many times I have had mirelurk kings running at me after scorched Earth and then "here's a crappy 2 star combat armor piece as your reward.  No reason you could possibly want to see what's in front of you.  LOOK AT THIS!!!"
---
Gee, thanks.  Now I have crappy 2 star armor and lost the flux I just had.  An option to turn this feature off would be really fricken nice.
---
I keep finding him down here. https://i.imgur.com/9k39D4w.jpg
---
I wish we received credit for not playing that mode lol 
---
I'd rather have a root canal from the guy that designed the Ammo converter lol. The weapons, armor, and the jumping lol the hiding in the bushes, the group camping, loading screens, the Perk cards? the tutorial on wtf is happening here.
---
I was hoping my level 400 bloodied would somehow glitch into NW from the fast travel bug in Adventure so I could complete my NW daily lollll I'll pass on NW, have fun...
---
It's a skin that you need to apply to an existing piece of armor, not a new armor you craft.
---
That’s actually a good and fair price!
---
[New Vegas had it as a mod for the Fat Man.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fat_Man_Little_Boy_kit) It would strip down the weapon size even further and reduce the weight by 50%.
---
Fun fact: The Fat Man weapons in the Japanese version of the game were just called Nuka Launchers. For extremely obvious reasons.
---
Adding to that - when You finish - share it! I'm more than curious to see the result!
---
It seems like they always spawn at bravo as long as no one is in that room at around 5:30, 3:30, and 1:30. This allows me to tag quickly and then use the follow me emote. It’s just really annoying when someone is standing in there.
---
If your on pc and need a bro to help out or soak damage feel free to add me AngrySunshineBandit
---
I started it because of SCORE, but after 3-4 games I started to enjoy it. This afternoon I stopped playing the main game just to play NW. I'm terrible at it, but I'm enjoying it
---
I think i'm using  [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f443de&amp;d=p02pg2ph2pi2pp2eu0ao0a30an2a72la2l71lu2lt2ir2lk2ce0c62eh2a04sg2&amp;w=cr0cu2&amp;m=0512c9fe8b3&amp;n=My%20build) right now.
---
The mounted owlets are not what they seem...
---
Another thing I’ve noticed is the graphics tend to mess up a bit more with me, and multiple times when I go to the whitesprings resort, I go inside and down the stairs,it stutters and jumps me back to the top of the stairs.
---
I didn’t think season would put such a big damper on the game, it’s just some items that could have been in the atomic shop, so I wonder how so much got messed up with this update.
---
Resources become less difficult to acquire after several hundred hours and I could probably churn out a few dozen sets with those mods with stuff I have in my stash box atm. It was likely intentional. Keep the jeep rollin and pay it forward when you can.
---
Would love to come visit... when I find a way to escape the black lodge...
---
Ill have to learn the circuit as it was pretty hectic until everything died to a single hit
---
Once you get the final key you can skip the rest and go straight to the ammo, but it's like 50 ammo or something every server hop.
---
I honestly miss it. Nothing beats getting home from school getting on xbox live and screaming obscenities at people you don't know.
---
It genuinely feels like PA melee builds were super nerfed since the start. Rant incoming...
---
When I started playing I remember getting a lot of diseases, but it wasn't such a big deal because VATSing with my melee weapon made short work of most things. Now the VATS radius is smaller, so I can't hit enemies unless I'm really close to them. I am basically constantly diseased. The Plague Walker mutation messes up Instigating weapons (my favorite) by doing a tiny bit of damage on everything (and killing bunnies) so I got rid of it, and now my diseases are useless annoyances.
---
I also don't aggro things like I used to, so enemies are constantly running AROUND me to go hit somebody else (often newbies) at events and I'm chasing after them. 
---
I can't hit turrets on the ceiling (I used to VATS them and I'd do a "Superman jump" to hit the ones like 8-10 feet in the air with my melee weapon). 
---
I also was usually able to get Scorchbeasts to land so I could hit them repeatedly, but now they rarely do and VATS sometimes won't target them even when I'm on the ground unless I'm right up in their personal bubble. So now I always have to carry something else for turrets and for anything flying. 
---
I have to constantly VATS because everything is just always running around ignoring me trying to fight it now.
---
Honestly melee is really sucking in general and sneaky sniper seems like the best way to get around these annoyances. Seriously considering re-specing but melee is my jaaaam. Ugh.
---
Also PA in general kinda seems to suck more. I'm used to dying because I'm right up in everything's face trying to fight it, but it seems like lately I'm way squishier than usual. Have to run with all the auto stimpak perks and PA pieces that I can. Doesn't feel like a true tank build is super possible? Or am I just bad at this lol
---
Drink first then spam. Problem solved.
---
Because Stash space is limited.  And if you're melee, for example, you probably have Martial Artist which increases swing speed and reduces weapon weight, such that leaving those weapons in the Stash is a poor use of space (a Deathclaw Gauntlet weights almost twice as much in the Stash).
---
Lol, in our house we never left quarantine 😂
---
YAY!!   So HAPPY!!!! I LOVE Slocum's Joe!!!!
---
Well it could be just an ultracite ammo factory, like the one from the raiders, and put behind some huge grind, Beth likes doing things like that, and there would be an option available....
---
Because there is no other perk that is all-encompassing like that, and rifle/commando users, in particular, have no weight reduction perks at all.
---
I think maybe the server may just need a tune up. It sounds like most of our issues is that the game isn't keeping up with the players.
---
Nope. You have to die in PvP.
---
Yeah, I know that but there will still be people that complain about the SCORE points that they passively earn after hitting Rank 100.
---
If your "back into quarantine" you did it wrong. Just saying
---
Thats a nice thing about running melee,it gives people plenty of time to tag enemy’s and if you can’t tag it by the time I reach the enemy then that’s your problem
---
Yeah I got it and it’s up again cheers
---
Well I would've been looking forward to these if the game didn't auto complete and give me none of the reward for all but 1 of my daily, and 4 of my weekly's. 
---
Goodbye 6250 score. Guess I won't be catching up this week.
---
Then again it’s not something people would want and since ultracite ammo is endgame loot it’s a grind in of itself and too out of the way to make it leaving ultracite ammo making up to a machine would ruin the experience of making a new ammo type of an existing ammo
---
Lever is amazing. If you can and you get anything decent to trade seek out an instigating lever, you'll one shot the majority of stuff in the game!
---
And we all hate huge grinds
---
Totally agree! Why can't these notifications be shown in a corner of the screen instead of obstructing the center of the screen where the action is happening!?!
---
How do you find running without gunsmith? I hate having it take up 4 slots but i also hate having to constantly repair my weapon
---
That's my point. You want to preach about balance, there isn't any. Legacies aren't the root of the problem because nothing is balanced.
---
Deployed 3 camps and yeeted off a cliff
---
For real?
---
Preferably done with an ebay kit by someone with a great 'have a go' attitude.
---
&gt; It's not wrong.  
---
I didn't say it was?
---
I mean, in Carl's Jr.'s case, it stemmed from the fact that it's owner had a larger restaurant and ended up creating a spin-off of smaller ones.  Hence, they were "his junior."  Slocum's Joe would imply it's Slocum's coffee, most likely.
---
my lever action rifle almost never misses on 95% but i cant say the same for my gauss rifle that misses every other shot
---
I can see why Destiny 2 does it. But Fo76 really has no need to do it. A lot of unused areas that's just random forgettable mob spawn locations.
---
I hope you’re on Xbox because I would love to see it.
---
Better than when he sits up and shits his bed.
---
I’ve looked at the map and seen unclaimed workshops. As soon as I fast travel there it shows as owned. 
---
I think there is a visual lag. This is why I always check once again after I get to a workshop.
---
Wow. I love this community. Thanks.
---
Why is everyone so interested in nukes all of a sudden?
---
Exactly. Perfect for it
---
Seems to be some sort of bug, workshop already claimed isn't popping up all the time, noticed this today with doing the weekly. Kep fast travellnig to workshops that are uncliamed and when I arrive it actually is. 
---
I can't say as I know the limit sadly but I just wanted to point out this little "feature". I had PVP bois crawling all over me as I actually claimed the workshop I went to, and some other entirely different guy arrived jsut as I got it then started trying to shoot me with a bloodied 50 cal whilst I was out of the zone leaving.
---
knowing bethesda and past experiences they probably wont do shit. unless you get local cops involved and have actual charges pressed lol. but seriously why the heck are people so mad. its only a game.
---
Something like Festus would be nice!  But since Sunset Sarsaparilla is not present in Appalachia it could be Nuka Cola themed with Bottle &amp; Cappy.
---
Nazi POSs are always very toxic players at the same time.
---
Use the back button after dropping ammo. It goes faster.
---
You can trade in Mini Nukes. You need 3 of them per conversion though so it won't appear if you don't have enough.
---
Move your camp placer to the border line then it's guaranteed to move your spawns location and then test it out if that does not work move ur Camp some places are buggy.
---
If you have access to Defiance, it's just a quick trip to the elevator, otherwise it's Big Bend Tunnel (Due South of the fort). My first time in the area, I tried to scale the cliff near the monorail without any mutations or jetpack.
---
Same I lost 4500 weekly score and 1750 daily score. 
---
I was looking forward to making some headway.
---
They are valid, you probably just don't have enough to trade in - it's 3 per.
---
Three main reasons:
---
They want consistent daily logins for a half hour to an hour instead of once a week logins for a few hours. It makes numbers look better and maximizes the amount of exposure to the atom shop you'd get. 
---
Since bethesda won't ban blatant cheaters, dupers, real money traders, or people showing you how to cheat, the best they can do is preventative. You saw with the latest dupe wave that people got themselves hundreds of thousands of treasury notes. With the daily limits, that's not nearly as useful as having hundreds of thousands of gold bullion available, i.e enough for every single gold item in the game so far. People had infinite caps and scrip with the duped christmas gifts, and you saw how much that ruined the game for everybody. Until bethesda starts actually banning cheaters and removing cheated items, it's the closest we have to any kind of control.
---
Since there isn't any real end-game content other than grinding for god-tiers, the limits act as an artificial way of extending your play time. Without them there, most veteran players would already have run out of any reason to turn the game on a long time ago.
---
PC, but I'll be sure to post some photos, if I manage to do something decent.
---
I don't need gunsmith or luck of the draw since i've been playing this game a long time and have close to 300 repair kits from Queen. And if i ever would run out of them (which won't happen) i have fallout 1st and unlimited scrap box with repair materials for gazillion repairs.
---
Well I have watched a few youtube videos that go through the lore from fallout all the way through to 76 and then past it
---
Yes, you can. Just claimed the 25 bullion reward myself. I have not done any vault raids yet, so you can go ahead and claim it without worries mate.
---
Ghost!  They're fairly popular now, but I've been on the bandwagon since the first album.
---
They started off as Blue Oyster Cult/King Diamond-influenced music, with the concept of being a pleasant-sounding Satanic hard rock band in the 1960s.  They've evolved a bit over the years.  Every album is slightly different.  
---
If you wanna try a radio hit single style song, check out *Square Hammer*.  If you wanna try something with a bit more meat, try *Ghuleh/Zombie Queen*.
---
Always welcome, but no more chess games please.
---
Doesn’t modus tell you...
---
You’re going to quit playing just because of adrenaline being broken? Damn.
---
I wish I knew this months ago! So much wasted ammo
---
Yes, THAT would be a great fix. I'm a sucker for trying very hard to keep my 2nd character's inventory clean just because of all the dupes I have on my main. So yes, destroying on drop is a great idea.
---
It was 100 last week
---
Ahh makes sense. Thanks!
---
Uh, it was always 100 SCORE per 10,000xp, what you smokin dude?
---
There is some and I'm not preaching I'm not a fuckin priest.
---
That strawberry perk bubblegum you like is going to come back in style.
---
THIS NOW!!! OR ELSE!! COME ON BETHESDA!!
---
QUALITY OF LIFE FIXES!!!
---
Automatic guns are terrible ? What do you use ? My bloodied fixer wrecks the queen in the air, shreds on the ground and one taps most mid tier enemies
---
It was 250 score for me for the past week...?
---
It is the same. 10k XP for 100 SCORE... it is not changed. It never gave 200 or 250.
---
I'll gladly share, and thank you.
---
np
---
Put thousands of hours into ESO. The PvP elitism in that game is absolutely dumbfounding. It honestly has worse toxicity then WoW or any other PvP game Ive played. Didn't use to be that way but it's gotten bad since about a year ago.
---
That's what we get for beta testing.
---
"cause some noob decided to run thru somewhere they shouldnt have been "
---
I stopped reading here. GG
---
It was 100 from the beginning. The 250 you were getting was from daily challenges
---
I would if my loot would load ;~;
---
To use a term I generally despise..."Fake News"
---
It was 100 last week, its 100 this week.

I know you aren't asking for advice from some random internet person, but please reconsider getting a pop culture tattoo. I don't mean to sound elitist but, people are totally going to judge you for it, and not in a positive way. 
---
I like them too, but I think I'd stick with a nice tee shirt or something.
---
Shiiit, you're lucky then,  it hasn't changed for me, always been 100 for repeatable, 250 for the dailies.
---
I was wondering why i'm suddenly dying a lot more often. My blocker probably isn't working..... or i'm shit lol.

Imagine thinking that no one has ever threatened murder on the internet &amp; then done it.

Imagine thinking that if someone is threatened with death they shouldn't write about it in the online community it happened

nobody else did

I crafted a combat shotty and went to the Morgantown airport. Finished the challenge in 10 minutes.

I was agreeing with you and adding support.

Who said anything about me demanding that only stuff I prefer being in the atomic shop? I just would like a week where the theme isn't some goofy or wacky colorful style. Theres been far more weeks of silly items and cosmetics vs more serious and badass stuff. I like black, silver, gold, and a futursitic and clean style with things. Theres been next to none of it ever in the atomic shop
---
I think you are right, I just tested it and it only failed to protect me once in 10 tries.  That one time was a scorchbeast at Line in the sand and it downed me instantly.  Exploding cars never harmed me, nor did my own explosive weapon.  Maybe some of you could test this further.  It *could* be related to lag, failure to act before I am already dead.  There is a lot going on at line in the sand.
---
Replies like this should get more upvotes. I like it when people take the time to explain things in full detail instead of saying “just google it”.
---
Definitely use VATs. Makes Shotguns deal much more damage because they're bugged. You won't hit first time, so turn VATs on and off, you'll get a hit the second time you enable it.
---
They need to include the ability to remove pop up notifications in options.
---
- Legendary Weapons/Armor
---
- Event Fan Fare
---
- Event Notifications
---
- Quest/Daily Counters
---
While they’re at it, how about an option to turn off the 3d model preview within the inventory lists so they might load by faster!
---
We need a SBQ mask now 😳
---
by accident I have 7 different guns I use for different situations .. and 2 pieces thus far w/ WWR which makes my life easier
---
I don't use any utility perks for weight reduction, plus rifles doesn't even have one if I went that route
---
I could turn all these weapons in to the legendary machine but .. they have proven to be really effective in the situations I've needed em .. so why not keep em
---
He was probably using the bounty as a way to trick lobbies into attacking him so he could steal their junk. I see people do it all the time, unless you have top tier weaponry, it's almost impossible to get through the armor and perks. Good on you, I always indiscriminately hunt down bounty players.
---
Are you saying that automatic handmades and fixers are garbage??
---
So people who just want to play the game and decorate their camp. Fine. No biggie.
---
But it would be nice to have a different style of interior stuff that isn't based on some silly character or brand name. 
---
If my character can craft fully functional appliances, surely they can clean and polish them
---
Then dont, its not like i wrote this with the intention of having Rammadeus the great read it so he can give his just as pointless opinion lol
---
Lol dually noted... best thing about my child hood was being raised that others opinions of yourself only mean what you allow them to mean. Stay safe in the waste land
---
Tenderizer and Concentrated Fire. I have both and have never seen a damage increase. Also, Concentrated Fire is kinda broken since V.A.T.S. randomly deactivates.

Wont lie, I was expecting something about the butt to follow these words.
---
It's real easy. Just head to a high level. Turn away from them, and squat down. Just be sure to dump your junk prior in case they aren't a respectable assassin. Consider it a mercy killing.
---
yeah, this is why I'm so careful with purchasing stuff and try to look for some info first.Thanks for the heads-up
---
Cause they don't test a fucking thing. If they can charge for it it goes in regardless of condition. I love this game but I am about fucking done with Bethesda.
---
Crap I didn’t even think of that, I wonder if the situation will get worse with it going on Gamepass
---
He was out in the woods one time...guess the toilets were clogged. They really do need to fix that pipe problem at foundation
---
Yup. The placement seems to be more precise than it was. I've had a few times it's failed and then with a bit of tinkering and small movements between waves (away from the gate slightly not forward) it then starts working. 
---
But it's definitely more finicky than it was it seems.
---
Can you only build one, or is it limited to four, same as the other vending machines?
---
Yea I'm on xbox and I've had that problem with the bow and compound bow but my handmade and cr have no issues.
---
Wierd
---
You've heard of me? I didn't think news of my exploits would have reached whinesville!
---
Lmfao. Ok buddy.
---
It's same as the others. You can have four of them.
---
Only if I can fish with dynamite.
---
What is it with this guy and beds? Every time I talk to him while he's sleeping he stands up backwards out of the bed and face it while talking to me. Ward is a mess.
---
I played through reset this morning and watched them change over. All mine came in fine. Honestly I do this almost every morning for the dailies as that’s just the time I get to play. Haven’t had this issue yet though.
---
I’m saying their semiauto counterparts are superior
---
He's not the only one lol.
---
I love the irony of how this patch introduced new public teams and bugged away the standard teams
---
I just try to bush camp every day for the challenges, and try to get the glitched rewards from Halloween
---
I'll try to do it again when I have that many and see what happens. Some of the more oddball ammunition is a little bit more tolerable to cash in given the small amount I typically deal with.
---
Time to go vendor hopping again to run into these guys. Wish we could tip them, I guess I’ll just buy random cheap stuff from the to help the cause
---
No but my town does constantly warn us about old men on the internet
---
Cryolator- for the queen. 
---
Tesla rifle- for tagging enemies in public events. 
---
Shotgun- for general gameplay, gotta use vats. 
---
Gatling plasma- for melting a tough enemy. 
---
Gatling gun- when I need to hit an enemy faraway with decent accuracy. 
---
Flaming sword- for healing NPCs in events. 
---
You can use a diverse arsenal for many different thing as WW reduction applies to all of them. 
---
Bear arms covers most of my guns, but if I had 3 weight reduction pieces I could run 1 level of bear arms and use the extra points to crank out more damage in heavy guns. 
---
Right now I run a split build 30% heavy, 30% shotgun, and bloodymess. The shotgun is fine tuned to one shot all common enemies [mutants, feral, scorched, blood eagle's, cultists] the heavy guns is for everything else. 
---
I'm mainly a support medic, I suppress and tenderize enemies in events and can use stims to heal allies while running solar armor. But some WW reduction would allow me to free up more perks for some bonus offense. 
---
Right now I've got two sid weight reductions and it helps but WW would free up more since I can always get a chem reduction backpack for stims.
---
I got what I wanted - the space star wallpaper. I win fallout! Time to play something else.. as if :/
---
That looks fantastic. My efforts at a "single square footprint" CAMP ran afoul of the "can't place" error (which I never realized may have been a flaw specific to the cement foundation).
---
I eventually found a location I like too much to leave, so I gave up on the mobile camp, and just deal with not having the FO1 tent (I also canceled my sub a few weeks back).
---
Flux, public teams increase xp as well. Just a good event to farm
---
It really is a fantastic bundle and all the sales are good too
---
Thanks for understanding
---
It's happened before when I was logged in and playing at the time, today I didn't even have the game running during the reset and my challenges are fine.
---
Yeah. It’s been that since BETA.
---
My wife from the other room 'How the fuck! I'm in a metal suit!' but seriously PA needs to reduce disease chance by a percent amount.
---
How damaging is the hit to rep? I’ve thought about taking it all, it’d be the Raider lyfe thing to do. Not much I want though in terms of grinding for gold... (just the floor planters from foundation) on this character at least.
---
Looting quickly before the body slides off down a mountain.
---
I haven't logged in all day. It was my first log in, long after the reset.
---
I wanted to complain to a dozen posts about micro transactions and then after writing 3-5 paragraphs about a boycott or petition I stop and say, "fml I'll just end up buying that loot bag tonight anyways"
---
Though seriously this has to stop, especially with the lack of atoms to acquire from dailies and weeklies.
---
I had a mobile camp so I could always place my vendors. I had a popular camp spot, so when I could not place it...free move down the street.
---
But when I would buy more camp decor, I would add to it and get screwed not being able to place it. 
---
Love your idea!
---
It sounds like you had good people raising you. 
---
I hope you have a great time in game! If you ever see me come say hi!
---
9th-13th July
---
Yeah, I feel you. There really hasn’t been any apocalyptic themes, just sprinkles of it in bundles and one-off stuff. I still feel there’s been a pretty good mix of everything but a more serious theme would be a nice change from the goofy stuff. The gold skins they have for the .50 cal or lmg? Can’t remember, but that’d be nice to have across all weapons. The solid color skins like the black one for the handmade or the gold ones I mentioned should totally be available for all weapons because why not? It’s just a solid color. Exclusive weapon skins and all inclusive weapon skins should be a thing.
---
In the meantime I've got a quad-magazined silenced automatic 10 mm pistol and it's adorable
---
It took me 6 matches last time. Took me 1.5 real life hours to survive 30 minutes. Felt bad man.
---
Perfect! Easy challenge down!
---
Dude, angryturtle on YouTube put out a nice video on how you could solo the event. Really worth the watch.
---
Now you're making me want a Star Trek-style sliding door...
---
And I can say, it really works!
---
Pros:
---
- Story is not anything to write home about, but the story driven content should last you 20-30 hours or longer if you are more casual. There are several long side questchains that are fun as well. 
---
- Its fallout for the most part, and the world and atmosphere do an excellent job of feeling like an extension of other fallout games and telling their own stories well. Mistress of mysteries questline for example was my favorite (its a shame I beat it so early on).
---
- Vending and camp building are AWESOME mechanics in their own right. You can see some very amazing camp designs and you yourself can create your ideal palace. 
---
- Lots of flexibility in building your character until you get higher level at which point banking up enough points to change anything in a major way takes FOREVER. 
---
- Community in game is very generous and friendly (especially with text chat mod on nexusmods).
---
Cons:
---
- The Lag has been atrocious since beta and has never gotten significantly better. Every patch either makes the game slightly more or less laggy but its never consistently been better. Get used to stuttering and freezing even if you have a supercomputer and apparently on consoles its just always laggy. Their internal build they use for gameplay trailers is highly optimized to not show this and its extremely deceptive. 
---
- No endgame to speak of unless you love doing the same two things on repeat for hundreds of hours. I am allergic to dailies after 800 hours and will not be proceeding with score grinding. 
---
- The bugs. Oh god dont get me wound up about the bugs. Every single patch 1-20 (all of them), have introduced insane bugs and they have not been fixed or hotfixed in any capacity. When they get brought to attention the community managers do their best but oh god does the dev team work slow. Why that is has been speculated upon. As of right now, several very good and very commonly used perks just do not function anymore. Another bad example is how the water wheel which was a paid camp cosmetic item broke two days after release and didnt get fixed until this most recent patch so a month and a half basically. I cant list all the bugs here, there are literally pages of community made documents dedicated to listing all the bugs that have not been fixed and its a long ass list. The new grindy score system is also buggy and not rewarding people who actually put the time in the right amounts of score while simultaneously people discovered a godmode bug that allows near instant completion of the entire 10 week score system and are running around with the level 100 power armor. Vending was disabled for a full two weeks in may to combat a hack that was discovered. This was the straw imo that led to a lot of players walking away. 
---
- Dev team is out of touch in a super bad way and very slow to do anything. Every time they make a public statement or talk about features or updates they are just so off-base from what I believe players experience in game and it makes me eye roll. Its like having that crazy uncle at thanksgiving who says covid is a joke and vaccines are for mind control....like what? How could you arrive at that with the same info we all have? I guestimate they barely play the game to test it, much less for enjoyment but that is rage based and unsubstantiated but it sure feels real. A good example is the ghillie suit which has serious graphical bugs, and the ammo converter which fell so flat that the flat earth conference wouldn't even acknowledge it. We got a generic pr tweet about how it didn't live up to community expectations and its going to be re-worked with no acknowledgement of how it could have been allowed to be introduced in its current state and also has a blatant typo for an ammo type. Oh really pete when is that happening? Hopefully not on the same timeline as the water wheel. 
---
- The microtransactions are ridiculous. The atom store cosmetics are charged at dlc rates. 20 dollars for a power armor set I dont think so friend. Most atom shop items are color re-skins that cost a minimum of 5 dollars. Recently its been getting better, but not by much. The season system as a barely concealed cash grab.
---
There is probably more for each category but those are the big ones. Dont let my negativity get to you, I am just fatigued after the constant yoyo and finding it harder and harder to login each day when after wastelanders I was pumped to play 3-4 hours a day minimum. I also stopped playing hard when vending went down for two weeks as that and camp building is my main draw.
---
Thanks, And where did you find out about it ?
---
4 of them 😳 hope they at lease do the dance all at the same time. Imagine they all being off key
---
Yea there was so much Slocum's Joe stuff I assumed there would be SOMETHING not included that you'd have to buy separate from the bundle, but dang its got everything
---
Time to vendor hop again 🤑
---
Hmm I never noticed that, I will try it.
---
I will not use the ammo converter and at any time am selling all rounds in some quantity and usually have 5-10k 5.56 stocked at any one time all @ 1cea. Somtimes I cant keep it stocked but recently on all platforms it seems like the economy is slowing way down.
---
edit: on pc
---
That's something I never understood, I was visiting someone's base and seeing what they had to sell and a player started attacking me. My friend and I were playing together so we killed him and continued on with what we were doing. He kept following us and attacking us about 10 different times and was getting that we kept killing him.
---
Omg. Now I'm going to have to see if that can happen lol
---
They need to fix Ward. Rocksy and Wren seem to stay put but Ward is all over the place.
---
You need to craft a regular wood or leather armor then apply the gillie as a paint

That's literally the extact reason I got it.  I was spending at least 15 bucks a month on atoms (was still less atoms than 1st gives) so i said screw it I'll get more atoms for less money and all the other shit was just cherry on top. But I dont even no why I try with people like you, yall complain about everything no matter what
---
Make it so.
---
Maybe it’s bugged like the water wheel? 🤞🏻the bramin produces milk fingers crossed this produces eggs or meat
---
If you aren't doing a lot of high-level events, it can be challenging to find some legendary characters at the lower levels. At least it is for me.
---
Let's see that butt, guy.
---
You've really figured it all out, it obviously doesn't matter what I say. Maybe try being less judgemental. If I had to guess we all have a lot more free time right now, and maybe it could be put to better use.
---
15 mins before.  15 mins after.  That's the safe and tested method I have used for 4 days now.
---
Thanks (:
---
I am sorry to hear that. When you get a moment I just sent you a DM asking for some more information!
---
Or just quit after placing them and go back to adventure mode 😂

These are the kinds of post I like to see when I open this sub take this upvote awesome story!

Chances are this is the same issue why Bethesda made the studio scrap its first game back when they were looking for a dev team for 76, while their strength in development is microtransactions they mostly suck at it regardless. They try to make the Atomicshop the main focus of the entire game, implementing caps and more to gate you into coming back each day but instead of staying on top and focus on the requests of the players for said shop they just push content that only few asked for while forgetting what would've fit better in a given time.
---
I just logged in to find 6250 worth of dailies and weeklies have been completed, last time I was online was about 11am this morning, and I was last playing Adventure mode...
---
At this point I've gotta wonder if it'll be worth it to keep trying. Only noticeable thing to happen was my game crashed as I loaded in so I had to restart.
---
Kind of pissed the Clean Nuka-Cola machine wasn't made a vendor in the first place. I'd love a Nuka-themed restaurant.
---
I’ll be visiting you camp and buying stuff now 🤑
---
Hi, I think people think youre referencing to the old vault raids rather than the mission
---
I am fairly sure you cannot claim treassure notes until you finish the mainstory if thats what youre asking
---
I might be mistaken since theres been alot of updates since the dlc release, but I know I couldnt claim treasure notes until I had finished the main story on my main character
---
Good luck!
---
Edit: sorry didnt read that you meant the season pass so my bad! I think you should be good lol
---
Could've just added this onto one of the many posts about this
---
This is why the rebalance will be a good thing. It will make the whole map viable regardless of level.
---
You know nothing jon snow. Auto rifles are God. Junkies and bloodied do insane damage. Soec yourself on stealth and you become death. SMG ain't bad at all. 10mm is nice I've been using a b2515 and I vats all day long with it
---
Because it's fun.
---
That's a pretty good idea.  I think we probably have most of the assets one would need to accomplish this.  The red/white checkerboard floors and the wood paneling wallpaper would go a long way.  Maybe you could also co-opt the Crane Construction Co. sign to sport the proper logo.
---
WoW has always had a gold cap.
---
Recorded proof makes it hard to dispute. Or should, at least. May take time, but some sort of repercussion should happen.
---
They are with the one wasteland thing.
---
However with the current track record that’ll mess something else up in the game.  Like maybe bloody mess will stop working or we’ll get bonus damage from well rested.
---
I usually never had issues with auto completion but did Saturday. Didn’t even turn on my Xbox until 5 hours after reset and it happened to me when I went in adventure mode first.
---
And while they are at it make moleminers in uranium event level 50 plus.....if I wanted 3 pieces of scrip I'd head to leader of the pack.
---
PC, I fixed it though actually
---
They only seem to auto complete for me if the game is running on my PS4 even in the main menu, I've had no problems when I close the game before the reset.
---
I'm thinking it's taking your total stats into account for the challenge if your one the game during reset.
---
can't spend atoms on this stuff! must burn for SCORE.
---
I have literally seen him in *more* places since the "fix" patch than before. It's like he's actively flipping off the patch notes.
---
There was no patch so it should still happen.
---
Stabilized Stock and Stabilized Short Barrel make recoil barely tolerable with the 10mm submachine gun, but with Aligned or True mods it's near unusable.
---
Money
---
Eliminating duplicates may help some of the inventory lag as well. Fingers crossed if this is ever fixed.
---
It stopped working with patch 20.
---
Steve will be the first but he won’t be the last
---
It would be nice to go back to the forest.
---
I didnt say there shouldnt be clean variants of a lot of ingame camp stuff but to say that very popular brand theme shouldnt be in the atom shop or is trash bc u personally dislike does not reflect on its value to the community. There have been plenty of stuff that dont fit a ‘cartoony’ vibe, raider stuff, green thumb, the contemporary building. And datamined stuff like the vertabird PA i would say is cool enough without being too campy or cartoony. Basically no one is going to like every bundle theme, but that doesnt mean they are catering to any niche group of the fandom here. A lot of ppl wanted this and they gave it to us. Honestly tho, even if i didnt like the diner stuff id get it just for the train prefab.
---
It's in a safe, under a house, but there are a few steps to go through before you get to that point.
---
That usually happens when they experienced years of being picked on themselves.
---
Same thing happened to me. Bought slaybells for 900 and almost quit.
---
Amazing, thanks!
---
Had you been playing nuclear winter the day before?  Or anything unusual you can point to?
---
I've done it once before already with the Gauss Pistol and I was pissed but it's too late to claim that back :(
---
People will complain about everything. I'm sure people complained they had too many atoms (that they earned from challenges) and nothing in the shop they wanted to spend them on. You can't please everyone. If you can finish the season then you can just not worry about doing challenges. There will always be someone who will run into that scenario no matter what.
---
This object cannot be placed. It needs support. Now I understand why I have to move my camp 2 feet to fix it. lol
---
&gt;He was sitting on top of the Whitespring station firing his gun away at players coming in at the spawn point 
---
Isn't it funny how it's always the guys killing other players for laughs that act the worst when they get killed
---
I love the idea and the bar connection but I can't stand that music. Gonna have to hold out for basic version or something, sadly.
---
Guess it preserves my now-precious Atoms, at least.
---
The funniest part is that this just might as well be the actual truth.
---
I'm not saying you should do this because it messes with your team but if you choose a spawn near water and have aqua boy/girl you can hide out in the water for quite a while depending on how the flame shrinks.
---
Itd be nice to use the entire map instead of the same 3-4 spots
---
𝓑𝓮𝓬𝓪𝓾𝓼𝓮 𝓑𝓮𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓼𝓭𝓪
---
It's my grab a beer event, you can start the event, and sit at the entrance and get the treasury notes after 6 minutes.
---
That's the only reason to grind NW. I'm working towards getting the winter jeans and jacket and skeleton outfit
---
I have 1600 atoms and I really fancy buying the bundle mainly for the vending machine and the railway coach, even though I’m at max camp budget.
---
Has anyone bought the bundle that can speak for the railway coach?
---
I took 6 95% chance head shots. Oddly enough they all hit, a damage number popped up but no damage was done until the last one when the enemy got one(?)shotted.
---
I’m not denying that they can be effective, but I don’t see a reason to use automatics if the semi versions are better
---
You're quite welcome.
---
Even better wait till double xp to open them ;)
---
My issue isn't that we got this bundle its that every single week it's some bundle of something silly like this this.
---
I heard they were gonna change damage to % which would render bloodied builds useless. Like i think different people should see different mobs then everyone can play accordingly
---
I lost about 6250 score after logging in today too, the only thing I did before loading in was access the Atom Shop to check out the new bundle, did you do that as well by any chance?
---
I won’t argue there are a lot of dupes of all varieties out there.
---
I don’t know how it’s done, and would rather spend my time playing than researching how to.
---
I know between killing the legendaries, what my Santa collectron found, and what I bought, I ended up with several hundred gifts during the event.
---
If the claim here of having received/found gotten several thousand at a time, then the very small sample says the legit vs illicit is more like 10/90.
---
The annoying part is the excess ones I have, I can’t sell.
---
Man I lost my pet Scorched Mega Sloth recently too
---
I thought scorched pets were supposed to be immortal, I wasn't prepared emotionally at all ;_;
---
I hope our Sloths are buds in Sloth heaven
---
Even tho mine is probably in Sloth Hell lol, he was an asshole
---
In which way? I reckon headshots on semi auto rifles does a lot of damage, but DPS on full auto is greater, specially on queen runs
---
yah man feels bad when u get good roles that u wont ever use. S/o the AA FFR S lvl 35 gatling laser i found today in UF
---
I like dying in NW. It’s the only thing I’m good at.
---
If you were on this sub at all last year people were doing posts like "Daily reminder: the future-tec globe can STILL be placed without purchasing"  while it was available.  That's how I ended up getting mine lol.
---
Just unlocked the bats armor paint a few minutes ago. :)
---
Lol I stopped wearing armor but I repair all my weapons and power armor just from the repair kit drops from the Queen. I haven't repaired anything myself since I started killing the queen. To be fair I have lvl 5 gunsmith on most of the time.
---
Ooooo I love this 😍
---
Most materials in the end game you just have to grind to get unfortunately
---
I heard tenderizer, action boy and adrenaline are all bugged right now
---
Outstanding move
---
Think of how much fun the jail break event will be
---
If One Tamriel is anything to go by...no, not even a little.
---
Claiming counts. Just did it.
---
Edit: Nevermind :(. I must have been confused with the award challenge for getting a workshop.
---
Think they're making us spend the atoms so we can't use to level up on legendary run 🙄😭
---
You have to click on the "give award" button below the post.
---
you must be new here as the Bethesda CMs usually also scroll through here but can't respond to each and every post.
---
I sent you a list with the information attached. Thanks for the response
---
Cry me a River sweet heart. 
---
I love that they reduced the amount of free atoms. I hope they remove them from the next season entirely. 
---
Just so I can see all the whiners go into over drive over entirely OPTIONAL stuff.
---
Nope, just logged in directly. I got immediately disconnected from the server as soon as I got in. Never even got to load in.
---
Logged back in, all were complete.
---
Just I haven’t found any info here about tenderizer. Probably I’m blind heh
---
Possibly! Idk for sure tho
---
Start joining scorched Earth every time you see it pop up and get free improved repair kits.  Do it often enough and you'll never have to use your own materials for repairs again unless you want your gear at 200 percent condition.  They start to stockpile after a while.  I have 400 right now lol.
---
It's the Winter Jacket, pretty similar to the Fallout 4 counterpart, but with an orange and blue color scheme.
---
Same to you. Xbox gt same as here
---
Yes. More clothes. And hair.
---
On a good sever you have no problems.
---
Sick! Completely missed out on the xmas challenges so wonder what theyre gonna be, as for halloween I think I have the skelly costume left
---
Hmm, I actually had a soft crash when I logged in too, and had to restart, then saw them all completed, wonder if that's related to it
---
Either way it's disheartening, if this happens multiple times I might just give up trying...
---
Flag it for search. If you know where to look, it’s not so bad. Military grade duct tape and ammo bags.
---
Tea time would actually be difficult, itd be great
---
Wow what a dick. People like that usually are unsatisfied with their RL so they have to take it out on people online because being an asshole online is easy :/
---
That's just it, it's not fun at all. Personally i think we should have more events the Encryptid, one strong boss with many other threats in the middle. Something to keep me on my toes.
---
fun! but they really should have been implemented in another way. nobody had them by july 4. what a waste.
---
Of all the things to moan about!
---
Yeah they’ve been fairly scarce for me as well, I don’t believe I unlocked all the learned mods until around level 80 or 90 ish. I wanna say most of mine were from daily or event rewards, non legendaries.
---
I have a 1 star bloodied BCG on PC
---
I snapped up the whole thing, love that train car
---
You better believe I’m moaning about it. I’m tired of complaining about SCORE anyway.
---
FYI the bridge next to Harper's Ferry lets you build on it, for anyone wishing to have their train cars on tracks!
---
Caveat: I have only put the CAMP and my protectron and turrets on it, so if  you have a huge current camp, test it on a mule first.
---
Alright so here is the deal.
---
The reason disease are so prevalent, and get noticably more so at higher levels is because their chance to trigger is "balanced" around enemies hitting you a certain number of times in a fight over a certain duration, but because of how the game calculates enemies dealing damage you "get hit" way, WAY more often than the numbers account for.
---
Let's hypothetically say a bloated glowing ghoul has a 1% chance to infect you with a disease every time it hits you. That doesn't sound like you would get disease very often, I mean how many times does one of those even hit you in a one on one fight. Let's think about it.
---
First, this enemy like all glowing enemies, and some non glowing, has a radiation aura(which does so little it doesn't even register as a rad, but is still there). Every time this effect is ticked by the game it deals radiation damage to you if you are in a certain radius. This ticks at whatever speed the game tics run at, lets say this is run 20 times per second. This means that simply being near this enemies is expected to give you a disease in about 5 seconds. Also, for fun reasons this lingers after the enemy dies, meaning you can get a disease from a corpse.
---
But what if the ghoul slaps you, obviously you take one hit, but this enemy, like many has a ticking damage over time effect, in this case radiation, which also has a chance to cause disease every time it "hits" you at the game's internal tick rate.
---
So if you get hit once by a single diseased glowing enemy you get hit roughly 50+ times in a second. Which at a 1% infection rate will cause you to be diseased very quickly, and this is why disease are so overly omnipresent, because their infection rates do not take into account constant passive sources that hit you insane numbers of times very quickly. 
---
Because most low level enemies don't have these irritating passive abilities hitting you 40+ times a second they very rarely cause disease, and getting certain disease is super hard because there are no enemies with these effects, making those disease actually reasonably rare to pick up in a fight.
---
Not to mention, they could just give the entire player base a bunch of free score. 
---
Roughly as much as the time span it took to fix the problems, adjusted for the scaling score levels. 
---
Problem solved.
---
Reminds me of my last fasnacht parade before the event ended when one player blasted *NSYNC Bye, Bye, Bye. And then as the event was nearing its end Call me Maybe. Which I though was an odd choice until I heard the lyrics. “Where you think you're going baby?
---
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
---
But here's my number, so call me maybe...
---
Before you came into my life
---
I missed you so bad
---
I missed you so so bad.  Lol.
---
Exactly for me too
---
Are you running max White Knight (AGI)? That brings repair costs down considerably. Also, Lucky Break (LUCK) will repair your armor sometimes when you get hit. Setting your ScavengeBot to get junk will also net you a few Ballistic Fibers. Lastly, visit any military outpost to farm.
---
Grim Reaper's sprint never had a proc animation/sound. I've been using it constantly since Patch 20 and it procs all the time for me (i.e. I see my AP bar refill).
---
Yea, there does seem to be a lack of specifically tailored female clothes....
---
Grognak, Queen grognak, nuka-cola girl, poodle skirt, slinky red dress, plain A lines (asylum worker, or the blah green dress) witch outfit, and the Victorian era type dress.  maybe a couple others.
---
Although if you want to show off curves, there is the marine wetsuit ...  :)
---
Best thing to spend your caps on is bulk ballistic fibre from the robots.
---
I can get it down to 270 each with perks and unyielding armor, it's expensive at 27 caps each, but better and cheaper than farming it.
---
Its not tho. What was silly about the flyboy or camouflage bundles except just not being good value? Whats silly about the log cabin bundle? The contemporary bundle is still probably the best value and has nothing ‘silly’ in it. Honestly the only “silly” bundles in the atom store rn by your tastes is the unstoppables, invasion from the stars and slocum joes. Thats 4 non ‘silly’ to 3 ‘silly’ camp themes in the store right now.
---
Dang! I'm on PC
---
Ive been hoping for a ball gown since I first found the civil war era dress in the beta. They have the tech and are refusing to use it! I also think there’s only been a single hairstyle (not ported from 4) in the atom shop.
---
Haha!
---
I'm completing what I had left incase they actually address it. I've lost 7500 score so far. Enough where I'd actually be around rank 24/25 right now.
---
thanks friend!
---
Mysterious Stranger still doesn't work properly this patch either. Most of the time you will hear the music and see the icon pop up but he doesn't actually show up and do anything.
---
Lol he's a one trick pony. People who do melee builds are lazy and don't know how to run anything else. And if you fight the queen, you're more of a burden and a free ride than anything else.
---
tbh it feels like it needs to be changed to a Combat Rifle skin, given that it says "7.62 NATO" on it and it's something we don't really have "reskins" (mesh changes). In a perfect world it would have been a new midlevel sniper rifle, but oh well :P
---
It would be nice to feel like those events could go poorly. They’re just guaranteed bullion at this point.
---
The rare rewards are the bear arm plan the stim pack diffuser plan the bear arm mods and the arktos pharma backpack. You need at least two alive for the bear arm plan. You need three alive for the stimpak diffuser plan. I've read that you need to shutdown the regular experiment and do the querqus one for the backpack plan. I think you need three alive for the mods but I'm not sure.
---
You ever try a two shot 10mm sub? Even with the stability mods you’re shooting the sky by the 5th shot lol I scrap any two shots I get on a 10 mmsub
---
Not that it helps, but if you die soon after scorched earth when you’re event flux, it just vanishes, nobody can loot it.
---
The vendor is on point
---
I agree. I had fun for a while with the civil war dress and cultist mask combo but i would love more fun ladies outfits. Where are all the fallout 4 laundered dresses? 50s styles? Natural hair? Fun t-shirts? Prom/wedding/party clothes?
---
Damn, that's a lot, I just finished my only remaining daily, kill 10 robots, and I've just called it for today. 
---
I got close for a level up this morning before work in preperation for tonight, so I may as well hope tomorrow's dailies work
---
&gt; Grim Reaper's Sprint: Seems to work but with a 20% limit to movement speed. No effect if Speed demon mutation or emergency protocols is active. Cancels out the gains from the perk. Probably as intended.
---
How did you arrive at this conclusion? Grim Reaper's Sprint has been working fine for me all of Patch 20.
---
Got a message on screen saying that someone stole my junk. Still very bitter.
---
Most of the bot vendors have bulk ballistic fiber for under 300 caps if you use hard bargain3 and grape mentats.
---
Sheepsquatch fur scraps to ballistic fiber.
---
So do military ammo bags (camp McClintock, Ft Defiance, occasionally looted from dead enemies), 
---
Military grade duct tape is another source.
---
Remove the currency caps &amp; you destroy what little is left of the economy.
---
For real, the second you load into Cyrodil, its a mess in chat.
---
Only the equipment you gathered. Your level stays.
---
Explosive furious faster reload combat shot gun last night.  Couldn't bring myself to scrip it.
---
I recently kept a ghoul slayers explosive 10mm pistol just to try it out and it’s now my go to low level mob killer. Admittedly mostly for the pumpkin skin I was now able to get but it’s a lot of fun too.
---
I actually like the season pass as well. Free atoms are cool but I've never grinded them out to get anything. I'd much rather spend 10$ here and there. Shit take caps, atoms, scrip, and gold off the pass and give more unique and cool things.
---
Thank you! Perfect! I’m jumping in.
---
Not much but I've heard that being at the Neighborly rank with both helps to prevent a big loss in rep.
---
On the topic of vats, ever experience when you're VATSing on an enemy, start shooting, then after 8 bullets it auto reloads? If it isn't that issue has anyone experienced when you do vats It'll just stop vats if you mag dump? While still having a full bar of ap.
---
Agreed, if I’m just not feeling it or just need the event xp/ treasury notes it’s a nice easy event to do alone along with the meditation event. Also every so often the event bugs out and either doesn’t blow open the entrance to the mine, or you go in and the path is blocked by rubble
---
Did you visit the atom shop first? I had the same thing happen and I think it was because I visited the atom shop first.
---
Good call
---
You don't lose anything. You go into Nuclear Winter with none of your character's stuff. You loot inside the mode and the weapons/armour/chems you loot are re-designed specifically for NW.  Anything you loot is for that game of NW only.
---
You do however gain EXP and Caps towards your Adventure mode character!
---
People are saying it's always been like this but I think it got noticably worse after the last patch.
---
I run through it solo every time it comes up.  I use a shotgun and one shot everything and half the miners have shotgun shells.  I leave with 200-400 more shells and get steady killing for 6 straight minutes.  Nice containers pop as you go along the way, netting nice scrap, some rare and an occasional legendary.  Then I turn in tokens for the 40 reward and more junk.
---
"I got my tattoo on the Facebook Marketplace."
---
Some vendor bots sell bulk ballistic fiber. It is not cheap. But if you’ve got high charisma then it helps reduce the cost.
---
So we can put that heavy shyte in our scrapboxes. Look for the tent as soon as she dies and the quest rewards pop.
---
So in reality we didn’t need NPCs In Wastelanders just more animated robots.
---
Thanks for asking! I’m a high level player as well, but don’t PVP, so don’t have much interest in NW. 
---
But I am still curious... and not willing to damage my primary mode of playing just to try it out. 
---
If there’s no risk to my primary character, maybe I’ll log in and try NW out. 
---
Thanks for asking... I was to embarrassed to ask the basic stuff.
---
Annoyingly I did to check out the new items, and then when I tried loading into Adventure I had a soft crash, and had to restart. 
---
However, I just talked to someone else it happened to, and they didn't access the store before, so it seems there's more than a few triggers for it...
---
$5 well spent
---
So what, i got BE . 50 cal from uranium the other day, its still doing its job, its like 10 damage less?
---
My friend has a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet +50 limb damage on ps4
---
Fucking inspired. I love it. Please post pics when you're done.
---
This happened to me twice so now I book it to my tent and dump scrap asap
---
Mine as well  lost 6250
---
Ah, I see. Well I got the fly-boy so it works pretty much the same. I can't stand waving close to someone and it looks like I'm waving to someone on a hilltop.
---
Most of my Challenges are completed too. Logged in 5 minutes ago weekly 3/8 completed and dailies 5/7.
---
 What are they doing at bethesda? How can it be, that nothing works properly they do.
---
Will probably bug it, seen as NW was the primary cause of the auto-complete bug before Patch 20.  That said, I cannot confirm because I haven't run the risk.  EDIT: The patch notes \*said\* it was fixed, but as we know, now the bug is present even just in Adventure mode. I wonder if they did fix it for NW and that's how it ended up broken elsewhere.
---
Took me only 1 day, during weekend, to get glowing skeleton (was not playing in 2019). Go for it, there is some cool weapon skins too
---
Did you speak with the Gold guy at Foundation?
---
I'm starting to think the devs are writing wonky code on purpose just to have fun with us and live up to the Bugthesda name. If they ever create a bug free game, we'll get suspicious.
---
A business that needs money to grow and pay employees. How dare they!
---
The NW weekly bugged out for me, and gave me the SCORE after completing todays NW daily.
---
Hooray!! Let the grind continue
---
Yup, checked both gold vendors. Nothing new.
---
Get secret service armor doesn't need ballistic fiber
---
20
---
Just type the same question on YouTube, you will see it. It was FrenchTomahawk, he making funny fo4 videos, and Bethesda send him a gift for launching first nuke
---
https://youtu.be/UjsDyuz8Oo4
---
So present myself to them? I think I'm good. Had a friend mercy kill me instead
---
But Slocum Joe's has canonically never BeEn oF tHe TRaiN cAr vARiaNt
---
18, about to start challenges for week 2.
---
helps keep things in perspective that even though the game isn't perfect, it's gotten a lot better :)
---
Just get a Tesla rifle with an automatic barrel and sprint tag everything. Don’t even worry about killing them with people like that there.
---
They've banned plenty of people for exploits.
---
The issue is, they don't have the tools (or the manpower, or both) to really dig into the more nuanced details.  If someone has 100,000 of some item, they can find that.  There are some instances where they appear to have found a way to remove specific items from people's inventory across the board.
---
What they don't seem to have is the ability to find edge cases where nothing is obviously wrong, but the details would prove the issue are more than they can easily look up.
---
The god mode glitch is something completely different, it's not a 'thing' they can look for, they need to figure out what combinations of things cause problems.  It's a lot like duping...if they know what to look for, they can swat that fly, but there are other flies that they don't see yet, and it's hard to just go look for them with no leads.
---
No you must be very new here if you actually believe that. They very very rarely come here and when they do they will look at the top posts with most upvotes to see what are the most talked about issues. They don't have the time to go through hundreds or thousands of posts. That is what the official forums is for.
---
Typo, Supposed to read Dead Man Sprinting.  Thanks.
---
There is a spot I use for a red rocket fueling station with unexploded cars, been using the free states vendor to act like fuel pumps. I have yet to have them break or anything above the cars break from them going boom.   
---
Took me 5 hours to build it up and now since the stair pillars are buggy (literally can not even move a foundation that is not attached to stairs nor ever was) I will have to move my camp a bit to make the new slocum/red rocket hybrid.
---
Got to 23 today. If you're curious about where you should be to complete it by the end of week 10 by doing the bare minimum to progress at a steady rate, here's a spreadsheet (made by u/LifeKeru):
---

---
30, finished dailies but not weeklies today
---
So now you can wank to your friend's wife without fear of termites, all while knowing someone shares the same musical interest as you.
---
just messaged them
---
8 havent played since day 1
---
Thank you! I certainly will post, although it my take a while.
---
It's not a legacy if it's a quest reward it's on par with the Daisy cutter
---
Please not another one
---
Oh yeah thanks :)
---
They are probably salty because it ain't that great of a spot. They maybe thought you gonna nuke the Queen or WS.
---
Hah - I love the Forest Scout set - and finding that mask was a BUGGAR!
---
These still available?  I hit the point where I have about 7k xp to the next reward so I have no idea if it's patched yet.
---
Oh, I didn't know the clock moved.   That's adorable.  I'm not surprised - it looked like it could easily be made into one of those Kit-Cat Klocks.
---
26, claimed the sink which is cool.
---
For raw damage melee is best for dps it would be a plasma/laser gatling for dps
---
Sitting on 21, I’d be higher but missed a day of dailies and with the 4th of July I didn’t get to just sit back and grind XP, but I’m ok with where I am
---
This is what people don't seem to get. There'll be the top 1% dictating prices and then everyone else.
---
That’s great! Welcome to Appalachia, and I’m glad you’re having a blast!
---
Ah like that. Well I am a level 55 and non of my friends play fallout 76 and since the game said that the higher level areas needed 8 players I didn't want to end up dying so many times
---
Headshots, crits, and ammo imo. You save a ton more ammo with semi
---
I feel much the same way about my constantly waffling protectron.
---
Dropping nukes at the far SE point of the map, covering the fissure there, causes Scorchbeast Queen to spawn, so usually people drop it there.  Also Morgantown is a pretty low level friendly area, so you may be screwing over some people there.  Either way, it doesn't matter, it's your nuke and there's no rulebook on what you do with it! :)
---
This is probably a stealthy disable by Bethesda in response to an exploit that shall remain nameless.  There are some things that are related to this perk that they are working on.
---
You can’t remove caps unless you add in a legitimate sink of value into the game.
---
Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need right now
---
low damage resistance with a 1\* nocturnal rolling pin
---
RIP I'm xbox
---
An intern thought it was a Slocum's Joke bundle and included it.
---
Yeah I was kinds scared for the scorchbeast queen since you need 8 players to do it according to the quests. Since it was my first nuke I wanted to start easy
---
Unfortunately this tactic won't work. we are getting less atoms now but they aren't reducing prices on anything. So now people are going to just hoard their atoms even more.
---
Why do you hate PvP?
---
Amazing spread sheet, thanks for sharing your work 👍😃
---
Edit: Thanks to creator LifeVeru for sharing.
---
It’s your nuke lol. You can do what you want with it. Honestly there’s a lot of babies that play this game. They whine about everything but as soon as Bethesda shoves some more camp cosmetics at them, like this whole battle pass.. they’re satisfied. Like giving a baby a bottle of milk.
---
Good grief lol come on man
---
There's zero risk. You just enter with your build (SPECIAL) count as what you're able to equip for perk cards. You can equip 7 total perk cards, but total for any one SPECIAL can't exceed your maximum. The perks are unique to NW and many combine normal perks or mutations from adventure. 
---
Meta perks include Frog Legs (basically replaces Marsupial mutation), Bloody Mess (flat 15% damage), Lifegiver (45 raw HP is big in NW). The rest is up to you. Damage boosts for each weapon type, Lockpick or Hacker if you like hitting high value safe/terminals (I like these, they give you nice items).
---
RIP I'm on xbox
---
Whitesprings is a popular place as well
---
Don't you know you're supposed to be playing for them and not your own enjoyment? Geez! How dare you play the game you paid for your way!! 
---
/s
---
Mothman, unstoppable,  nuka cola, Slocums joe, grognak, the toy bundle from a while back, 4th of July stuff. Those are all goofy stuff.
---
The free states, responders, and aviators are okay, but their style is still super colorful
---
Yep.. Ditto. Submitted an error report (why, Idk)
---
Same here man :(
---
Yep, just boring chores
---
Don’t know why someone downvoted you. I gave you an updoot. I think that’s a great idea. Any implementation to get the game running smoother is, imo, priority. So many players keep looking past the clunkiness of the game and just demand more things to bog it down even more.
---
Bloodied Unarmed Melee is the strongest that I know of for close combat.
---
19. Could be further if my weekly and daily wouldn't autocomplete.
---
&gt;Finally someone with guts
---
God dammit Ward I ain't getting you no god damn bonesaw
---
Lower than I should be now because my challenges auto completed. Annoyed.
---
i honestly just want the vending machines at the train staations, practical and space efficient. the default vendors looks like someone ripped it out of a wood floored prison with a backhoe.
---
well, it’s a component for crafting, as are all the other junk items, so that makes sense. It’s also probably one of the remnants from the whole PVP side of the game.  At end game that’s pretty much one of the more popular junk items to get
---
It's literally just do some NW dailies. Pick the three easiest ones (today's one will take you longer in the lobby than the actual game, for example), and you get the same SCORE as doing all 7 dailies with no weekly.
---
What system are you on?
---
Apparently this is happening to a lot of people because it got me too. Only daily I was able to do was kill 10 robots and weekly was kill 20 creatures. All the rest auto completed.
---
Morgantown is very underrated. Lots of scorched who drop high radiation fluids and hardened/glowing mass and lots of cobalt flux. Keep dropping 'em!
---
Heya, it's a nice resource for giving you an idea of where you want to be at any given time BUT, I can't take credit for it :)  It was created by u/LifeKeru I believe.
---
EDIT: By the way u/LifeKeru your name is mis-spelt as Veru on the spreadsheet :)
---
It's all I ever wanted out of life.
---
I like rust when you find a good server. I love the PVP in that game but I also am a bit of a role player.
---
That works too. But yeah, I've accidentally become wanted. Went up to someone at WS, jumped out of my PA, turned around, and kneeled. Pop, lights out.
---
I just bought 1 ammo for 1 cap.
---
I just bought it this weekend as well, and so far really enjoying it with friends. The explore-&gt;kill-&gt;loot-&gt;craft gameplay loop is pretty fun. It is a bit glitchy tho, but nothing too terrible yet.
---
Got a nice cozy cottage and garden at my camp that sits right on a creek.
---
The perk system is a little mystifying after playing FO3/NV/4, not sure if cards are guaranteed at certain stat ranks or if it's just random.
---
True that. I just thought I did some dickmove or something that pissed them off lol.
---
PC
---
I have 8 different guns on me at all times
---
Got to 31 today
---
It's a display bug.  Doesn't actually charge you the caps at least when I tested it.
---
there is always a hard integer limit. and wow eventually upped their gold cap. 
---
but ive never seen an mmo limit the main currency this much.
---
How do you cash in the overseer tickets? Never play NW so this is all new to me
---
It does give more of an incentive for people to participate in the market. 
---
Player vendors is one of the greatest things implemented (besides cap tax) and i would've stopped playing for longer periods of time were it not a thing.
---
HERE WE GO! MERRY FASNACHT!
---
Wait so I don't play games for my own enjoyment??????????¿????????!!!!!!!
---
Good advice- beeline to the tent from now on
---
I want some of the rewards but I just jumped in my first game. It’s pretty cool haha. I was so worried about losing a lot things I built up to but you don’t at all. Pretty neat
---
I like this idea, well more on the exp &amp; resources side than the PVP aspect, but definitely found it interesting!
---
Right now there’s little incentive to get a Workshop as a team, since the resources you get are still geared more towards providing for an individual rather than a group, meaning that an individual would likely get a lot out of a workshop, but splitting the resources up to 4 ways makes it not as desirable. 
---
Increasing the rewards when doing so as a team, specially with a focused public team option, would make it more desirable. For instance, multiple the output &amp; storage capacity of resource extractors by the number of players in the team.
---
While like the idea you mention about the flags, I think it could instead be a opportunity to introduce clans or some more persistent types of teams, so that the taken workshops also become persistent, in other words, not requiring to build them from the scratch every time a team takes them over.
---
For what it’s worth, when they announced Fallout 1st, they mentioned they were looking into something like that:
---
“Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence.”
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce
---
The problem here the involvement of Fallout 1st, but the fact they are looking into something like that means that it should be possible.
---
Perhaps once the bunker system with instanced interiors is introduced during the winter season that could provide a simpler means to achieve persistent workshops, at least underground.
---
😹😹😹
---
YASSSssss!!!!
---
Speaking of pissing people off is it possible to drop a nuke on Flatwoods/ vault 76?
---
No. Morgantown is a great place to nuke.
---
It seems a bit iffy at the moment. I did the place three CAMPs daily today, but at game end I reached one of the other NW challenges and that counted towards the weekly challenges needed for some reason (so I'm on 2/3 after one day).
---
I've got 2 other friends who play, so if they came on line it's possible you might get the boot.
---
by what means did they 'get mad'? doesnt really seem like there is a mechanic for the others on the server to really express their displeasure
---
Auto railway rifle shreds things with vats, and ammo is like 7 steel per craft
---
Look out for the leader of the pack event at the fairground near vault 76. 3 guaranteed legionaries at a low level.
---
FYI, I keep tracking/posting them too: [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html)
---
I'm not your guy, butty.
---
Commando is the meta
---
Yeah turns out you're not bulletproof underwater and people can see you a far way off.
---
You can nuke anywhere you want. Everyone who complains about that should go through themselves. They're just troglodytes who expect to kill the SBQ every time a nuke is launched. 
---
Morgantown is a good area for crimson and cobalt flux, plus it's decent for legendary spawns.
---
Just got into the railway rifle and had no idea there was an auto mod for it. Definitely going for that now.
---
they kind of already do.
---
If you just use the power armour glitch you don't even need the key. Unless ammo only spawns when the door opens.
---
Me like weird kitty perks 🤔👍
---
I launched my first nuked on Charleston because I thought it was cool since it was in the trailer about nuking.
---
Yes please I wish this was a permanent daily
---
Go check out Medic on Twitch. he’s an awesome streamer and plays PC. He’s launched thousands of nukes and you may be able to get in a group of his :)
---
It's your nuke, you put it where you want to. If people get upset about it, that's their problem. I launched one of mine at Watoga, no one got mad at least not where they communicated it to me, but I had fun running around checking out Nuked Watoga. Entertain yourself first, it's your game.

So when you get duplicate cards it gives you overseer tickets. When you look at your perk selection screen scroll down to the cards you have available. There should be a prompt to press a button to show unowned cards. (Sorry I’m not in game now so I don’t have the exact language but on Xbox I think it’s L3). You then will see a bunch of greyed our cards with the price to purchase on them.
---
Buying cards makes it more likely to get a duplicate in a pack which means easy extra xp.
---
Thanks for the tip. I'm not really into twitch but I'll check it out
---
It's a great addition. My friend and I have built up his camp to be a Dine N Shop, so we have a giftshop and a diner in one. 
---
The bundle itself gave us alot to work with in the diner, the robot is really cool. Now we need donut recipes added outside the Fasnaught Donuts.
---
Ding ding ding! This is the reason why you nuke it. You can't get all the flux from the SBQ area. When I was crafting my jetpack I needed Cobalt flux and got pissed that there's only like 2 or 3 down there. Luckily someone nuked Whitespring and I got what I needed. There's more to this game than one enemy.
---
I'm seriously impressed with the quality of this item.
---
I put on goat legs and climbed the bridgework under the gorge bridge and got a nice solid 15 minutes before the fire forced me down and someone found me hiding in the red rocket shortly after.
---
You did nothing wrong. Its your nuke, you can aim it wherever you please. Only exception i would say is evnts like Fasnacht or the meat week prime cuts events. Its not really fair to nuke those, keep that for a private world. That's my opinion though. I'll happily nuke anywhere except those events.
---
Most people nuke Whitesprings or fissure prime for the obvious reasons. But other areas can be good too. Morgantown is pretty good, decent amount of flux and ghouls. Yes, it is an area low levels tend to inhabit in the early game but it hey just have to swap server if thier camp is in danger or avoid the area if they cannot manage it. Same as high levels who live in the main nuke zones. 
---
For what its worth, I love seeing nukes in different locations. Nine times out of ten I'll take a wander to it and see whats what. 
---
I've seen Morgantown nuked a fair amount though. So don't worry, plenty people do nuke there.
---
I got a BE submachine gun, but the 10mm hits harder.
---
Answer is yes, worked for someone else who commented and then me as well.
---
So today you've seen two cabooses you like?
---
According to Angry Turtle, the damage increase is there, it just isn’t reflected in the number shown when you hit an enemy.
---
Huh....I knew you weren't bulletproof but assumed that you were hidden the same way that creatures are on adventure servers.
---
Just claimed the flying saucer this afternoon, 24? 25? Not sure of the rank.
---
Don't worry about what other people think just do your thing.
---
Why won’t the bar pieces consistently snap? I can’t get them to properly connect to each other on a floor
---
Angry and downvote emote + voice chat
---
anybody else notice that one of the songs played at the purveyor station is eerily similar to the twin peaks theme? Maybe David Lynch could direct an episode of the fallout tv show. lol.
---
It’s cos you put steal instead of steel lol but hope it turns out well
---
The cap tax makes absolute zero sense. Travel fees are already a cap sink. The camp owner should get the travel fee when someone arrives. We shouldn't have to overprice our stuff just to recoup the sales tax.
---
To those who aren’t having any issues with action boy/girl, are you just watching the bar refill or are you able to run again once it does? 
---
Since update 20 my bar will visibly refill at the same rate, but if I try to run or enter VATS it gives the no AP clunk sound even when it shows it as filling or full.
---
Yeah buddy! I bought it recently as well and it is a great coop multiplayer fallout game. Seriously. If you enjoy Bethesda's fallouts and want to play with a friend or just people in general, this is the game. Community seems great as well, which goes in line with this post!
---
And tho I am having fun and enjoying it, I won't turn a blind eye to this game's problems. A ton of bugs (even for Bethesda's standard), lots of issues, and perhaps the biggest one - the predatory pay/atom mechanics. It's obvious Bethesda has gone in more of a "freemium" pay to win direction these days. Imo, 1st class shouldn't be a monthly subscription for what it offers
---
Only usable with vats tho, that recoil is nuts. Was having fun with quad railway during queen fight, could shot whole 40 bullets during 1 vats, maybe quad weapons have less ap consumption. And railways hit like a truck in general
---
Dont think so.. hahaha not when i can have the chineese stealth suit and a furious fixer and 2tap something. Or 4. or 1.
---
When I was playing at release of the game I had a 2k cap bounty from destroying peoples bases with mini nukes. No one wanted to collect and I was one of the first of the level 100+.
---
Not when you have a stealth suit and fixer thats automatic. 😂
---
What system are you on I can give you a bunch of it
---
I’ve got a mysteries display case too!
---
Nice and easy. Done them all except for the level ups (just one to match the daily, and no use in levelling up twice more today when there will proabably be 2 more level up dailies this week)..
---
For some reason I have 2/3 NW Weekly done, no idea how.
---
Exit vats and relock. That works for me almost every time.
---
I am lvl 120 still not DC one with my build
---
This would be a nice fix.
---
Regarding bonus things, I was hoping to get free fast travel to Crater and/or Foundation upon achieving max affinity with the factions or depending on which faction you finished the Wastelanders story arc.
---
I would have also liked something similar for finishing the quest line of the decreased factions:
---
Responders - Morgantown
---
Fire breathers - Charleston
---
Raiders - Top of the World
---
Free States - Abby’s Bunker (or maybe Harper’s Ferry)
---
Brotherhood of Steel - Fort Defiance
---
Enclave - Whitesprings Bunker
---
Slocum Joe -Girls love him, guys hate him. Find out why!
---
You lose nothing. You bring nothing in. You leave with nothing.
---
Ohhhh that's where it is. I never bothered looking there, I figure eh I'll get whatever ones I'm missing eventually lol. Thanks! Def gonna buy up the missing ones
---
Can this be bought on its lonesome?
---
Chances are, if you do SBQ, you’ll get at least 8 players (usually). I love the community feel of fighting SBQ; even if it’s without comms!
---
I did this, to pass the time..

I’m not very fond of the BoS, and would like the option to sabotage their return to Appalachia instead of helping them to do so.

If you're on PC i'm happy to help..

🤣🤣🤣👍
---
i will never understand why wanted players are not storing their junk until they got killed...
---
The UI definitely leaves a lot to be desired
---
Speaking of which that is intentional. The max speed boost you can gain in this geme is 20% which Speed Demon mutation already provides so it makes all Speed Movement gains in the game like Dead Man Sprint, Gun Runner, Squad Manuevers and Fixer crouch Speed increase pointless/disabled.
---
So people will kinda just gather to it if you nuke the SBQ area? Interresting. Might try that out next
---
Many thanks
---
Ghost is not bad, though all the diehard doom/stoner/sludge fans talk trash about it while secretly listening to it alone at home
---
&gt; You should be able to destroy/drop stuff you don't want, even quest items. Just mark them with a "This is a quest item, are you really, really sure you want to get rid" confirm button screen, and job done.
---
Yet you can drop/sell a special item you can only get **once** in the game (like the Blade of Bastet) without a blip.
---
Yep, it’s probably one of the only events that gets everyone’s attention still.
---
If you have F1st then its easy.. took 20 mins to claim 5..
---
Make sure you use it for X-01 and have purple lamp eyes👌
---
Well they did it, that vendor station might be enough to make me actually buy atoms
---
It’s a ruthless world out there in the Wasteland. You should have at least left the player one steel scrap so they’d get the message to go retrieve their dropped junk. 👍
---
No, I’ve launched at Morgantown before with no issues from other players. I’ve seen it nuked quite a bit recently actually. People are bored of SBQ and Whitespring.
---
What they need to do is give us back atom rewards because this grind for some lunch boxes and weapon paints is absolutely discouraging.
---
Grinding for atoms and being able to pick the reward was very satisfying. Now we are being robbed of 5000 atoms and forced into rewards i personally will never use. I used to be able to manage one nice bundle a month before.
---
This legendary run should have been an addition to challenges not removing them. It didnt add anything fun, just prolonged a grind and took away a little bit of reward we did have for playing every day
---
You shed a tear for the fallen score you'll never ever get a chance to earn
---
I had that happen the other day at Mineshaft Elaine where the entrance was still blocked by rubble when I went inside.
---
Level 270 is a mid level player? Not sure about that one chief.
---
Areas like Whitesprings, West Tek, Sugar Grove (basically anywhere in the southern Savage Divide) aren't really high level exclusive areas. Whitesprings is one of the areas that the Mistress of Mysteries questline takes you to which is a fairly low level questline. With Wastelanders, new players are directed to Foundation from level 20.
---
Personally, I've never experienced a low-level player who demands items from other players - they're generally very appreciative. I'd imagine that low-level players that do do that are probably experienced players playing on a new character. If you don't want to do it, don't do it - no low level player can track you down quickly since they don't have the resources to.
---
Low-level players ruining high-level events is nowhere near the same as high-level players ruining low-level events. High-level players who are farming treasury notes and instantly turning up to events like Feed the People or Tea Time and mowing down the low level mobs is probably quite demoralising for low-level players. Path to Enlightenment is the same on double XP weekends.
---
If you find it so difficult or infuriating to share a server with other players, whatever level, I'd recommend investing in First so you can play the game on your own. You can't police what other players do in an online game, especially when what they're actually doing is questing and exploring the map, like how everyone played the game at first.
---
Yeah I got the shop section of my camp made into a diner and that black &amp; white tile will suit it much better than the blue &amp; yellow tile I have currently.
---
Thank you! All thanks to people like you.
---
It's a vending machine skin. 
---
It is a protectron robot modified with a donut display as its head. It also looks like it has a dress. It moves it's arms and plays music. It "talks" but you can't really understand it.
---
C'mon monthly caps i neeeeed this
---
I did specify what was in the store **right now**. Also id consider mothman cultists a mixed bag, really the backpack and googly eyes are the only silly parts to me. 4th of july stuff on fourth of july is almost an obligatory bundle tho, and its colorful as it could only be. Toy bundle is just old stuff packaged together. Youre ignoring literally everything that doesnt fit your argument, there are PLENTY of non colorful, goofy, cartoony atom store stuff and i wouldnt ever say there is any less than the other, its a pretty balanced selection of the two.
---
Yea they got your junk but not your flux.  That mirelurk is there everytime.
---
I hate the fact I forgot to log back in last night to kill ten ghouls to finish off the dailies...damn it. So I didn't get the gold star one either!
---
I agree, and don't even get me started on the perk system.
---
It's a really hard gameplay mechanic to get a grib on, but I do think you gain specific perk cards at certain levels.
---
Nope you can see a clear outline of a player under the water if you're up on the cliff by the steel mill workshop, and hit them from there too.
---
weird its only on private servers, thanks though my man
---
That's cute.. but I'd just be happy with a vendor bot that is a Protectron model that just stands there and acts as a sales point.  Preferably one that has a 120 unique item limit so I don't have to put 4 out.
---
But then you have to glitch every time for the 50 ammo. I feel like if you're getting a lot of it it's easier to just get the key
---
For the power connectors? just got right on the power connectors and you’ll find them in there
---
The .45 or the 10mm?
---
I have 2 toons with the 10mm and love it. One has a Vampires Explosive for killin' critters and what not and the other is a Bloodied 15% VATs FFR which rips mobs to shreds.
---
Watoga vendors
---
Did any of the previous monthly Fallout 1st offers return? I want the elite ranger armor.
---
Yes it's still active it probably won't get fixed before they fix the score rewarding early
---
I remember some Runescape player serving time because he typed an in-game message about shooting up a school or something, he immediately played it off as a joke, but enough people reported him/called local authorities that it was too late
---
20. I would be higher but ya know, the game decided to wipe 4,000 score today by auto completing challenges. Cheers game!
---
Mmmmm try Grafton vendors (station and the other). I think those are the ones that sell combat armor mods, maybe the have sturdy plans too
---
Yeah I saw that as well, I thought I missed one but I completed it quickly before it switched over
---
Im level 20 in NW and its saying i need to reach lvls 12, 14, 18, and 20
---
maybe everybody. happened to me as well.
---
MMMMmmmm donut
---
Yeah, i've had for about 200 levels now, its the only thing my toon will wear since it was such a pain to get..
---
Just wait until you start encountering one of the bazillion bugs this game has. It just adds more and more!
---
22.
---
On PS4/Xbone you can press left stick to filter out plans you can't build. Why they don't just have the option to turn off atom shop and plan required items in build mode unless you purchase them/find the plan is beyond me tho.
---
How does the vendor work? I’m very curious!
---
Man you gotta laugh at that logic.
---
I never left lmao
---
and no masks required!
---
I found it odd that they threw it in the bundle too, but I'm glad they did, best value bundle I have picked up since the contemporary house one a while back.
---
Is it same CAMP budget cost as well?
---
no, the modern one
---
I never said I'm quitting, I'm taking a break, after 4K hours it's ok, they got retention out of me. I'll gladly return, after it's fixed. I love the game, but I'm not changing all five of my characters because of other people's incompetence, I got shows to catch up on.
---
Fiiiinally...
---
Is not! LifeKeru is my reddit name, LifeVeru is my IGN. Since I posted this on some discord servers I decided to use my IGN ʘ‿ʘ
---
Very true tho. It’s actually a lot of nice things for the atoms. But yeah I little odd imo at the same time
---
I lockpick junk extractors, pocket everything, turn around and dump them in the stash, and then hide in the bushes with chameleon. Never have found out whether my name shows when I'm crouched or not. But people seem to have a hard time finding me.
---
Same way you do it in Adventure. Open your Pip Boy and hit the associated button.
---
Also the other day there was like 50 posts with a shit ton of upvotes just for the ammo thingy. Let's have some fucking priorities please.
---
Wholeheartedly agree.
---
The 45 submachine gun is the most worthless weapon I want to love. The aesthetic is great. It’s got a silencer which helps my sneaky commando, but the damage is lower, and making enough 45 ammo to keep it fed just isn’t worth it compared to the 10mm.
---
Fair point, I hate missing out on stuff like that
---
Same as a standard vending machine, they make music and heaps of noise and move around at their bench a bit, they have rotating stacks of donuts in their heads.  They can also clip to the bar things that came in the bundle, so you get it looking all nice and neat. Bit buggy though, I had to do alot of removing and replacing things to get it right.
---
HOORAYY!!!
---
Action Boy works for some people. Test that out.
---
As for Adrenaline, I swapped for Gun Fu and Mister Sandman.
---
I still think that they should release GTA Online with a pure solo experience. getting ganked by jet bikes while running drugs in a tiny little helicopter will make me walk away from the game every time.
---
One tip I found helpful is to go to the Charleston Capital Building and start the automated numbers system at the DMV end (do B and then C). It'll cause groups of ghouls to spawn and come to you, which sometimes will include a legendary one. About half of my legendaries last week were by doing that.
---
All my free vendors were cleaned out yesterday which is great because I was at storage capacity and over encumbered.
---
The christmas unlocks do reset, at least the last one does.
---
I'm on PS4 , and have found numerous bags full of plans, I don't need them, so I don't pick them up, but 300 sitting and standing gorilla plans , with a couple hundred icicle lights and all back pack mods. It's a pretty regular occurrence.
---
It's good for getting the nuka paint
---
What you found was a workshop that someone owned, but hadn’t done the defense event, letting it get overrun. Before you can claim it you have to clear it, but it’s still owned by that person—it just doesn’t tell you that. Not sure if it’s a bug or just bad instructions.
---
Yeah I might have bought the train car, but I have zero interest in any of the diner/donut crap that comes along with it. Saving my Atoms for another week I guess.
---
Thanks for the tip, but i still can't see what i bought. Could it be glitched?
---
Yeah we are not talking about Christmas gift plans here
---
I would not have been able to finish the fight I would be laughing too hard 😹
---
Where do you get this? Atom store?
---
careful, someone tried to do the same and it made every weekly except that one auto complete with no score given
---
Wanna hear something terrible? I scraped one before I knew what it was because it said tattered.
---
Happy Fasnacht! Merry Fasnacht! Hurray!
---
That's what happens when he doesn't have his water cooled bone saw
---
Why thank you kind internet stranger! 
---
I’ve unfortunately run into a lot of people who can’t think beyond the scope of “I want more stuff!” when it comes to gaming. How dare anyone recommend ways to improve existing systems :(
---
Eh, I just go to events like Encryptid and SBQ and wait until people die to take all their junk. Costs me nothing whatsoever lol
---
"Crappy Slocum Joe" stuff? I'll have you know that I bought the bundle just for the Slocum Joe stuff for a CAMP diner.
---
my motto has been a will most likely be "The worst part of this game, is the players". I've had one maybe two pleasant experiences  with players I don't know
---
Yeah, I agree. Not worth doing all the other stuff for just that lol
---
Haha I’m gonna start doing that. Sounds pretty fun. I’m pretty sure your name will still show on the map if your wanted. But they probably just can’t find you since your invisible in a bush. They’d have to put their crosshair right on you for it to show your name I suppose.
---
Just wait til we get the red rocket diner prefab with a Mothman bundle of some kind.
---
Yeah it's also my walk away for 7 min event
---
The issue they have is because Destiny is already so large and they have to worry about console players limited space. Adding on my content means newer zones to shoot up. New content for us means another npc with voice acted dialogue.
---
I've been wanting the Satellite Dish. I missed it when it was a solo sale and don't want to buy the Invasion bundle. Typically unless it explicitly says exclusive, the bundle items become available separately. So it is more of a patience thing on the store rotation, but I agree. I wish We would have bundle items available separately when the bundles are up.
---
COMING IN THE YEAR 3 ROADMAP
---
I have yet to finish that part of the story.    
---
It is your nuke and your part of the story so aim it wherever you want and those crybabies can get over it.
---
Yeah before I knew junkies was a desirable prefix I was destroying them all lol
---
Back pack mod plans aren't Christmas plans. Fixer plans aren't expensive anymore. I haven't been able to sell any in months, I gave up. Last fixer plan I got, I just gave to a rando after the encrypted fight.
---
It's your nuke bro. 
---
One of my best memories was when flatwoods was full of new players and got nuked.
---
I saw it too late
---
Reading through these threads just makes me depressed now. How are people so far ahead with this?
---
18.    
---
I haven't started on the new Challenges yet but we'll see. I average 2-3 per day depending on when I get free time.
---
I don’t understand why people walk around with 700 scrap on them to begin with. It’s absurd
---
Do you play on PC? If so, do you have any mods? Also, did this bug appear for the first time today? I'm wondering if we're pidgeon-superstitious about being logged in during reset to be the cause of the bug.
---
Edit: nvm saw the comment where a player was affected on x-box
---
Everybody spam the subreddit now! That is literally the only thing that ever works!
---
edit: /s jic
---
Same! I'm only 14 and have been doing most challenges
---
Slocum Joe - Girls love him, guys hate him, find out why!
---
Lol please send me screenshots of your backpack and fixer and bear arm plans in surplus bags lying around  then I might take you serious.
---
Really?  Where does the quest line start?
---
Credit where credit's due, thanks for making this, it will be useful to keep track of my progress. 😍
---
Yeah new bundle, 1500 atoms.
---
Pretty sure he was being facetious lol
---
I'm pretty sure if you block for session you're invisible on the map to whoever you blocked. I do that when claiming workshops from others
---
It might be. Try reloading game?
---
Yeah, it seems to be account-bound, and not based on login time. Would you mind posting wether you play on PC, if you have mods, and if this was the first time?
---
No i don't have those, i mean the booth, stairs, stools and all of those.
---
Not only is adrenaline bugged, but I read other perks such as Tenderizer and Action boy/girl don't work either?
---
Like cmon man, I use all of those perks in my build lmao
---
Morgantown is great for Cobalt Flux &amp; if you get the airport, you get the event that allows you to farm lots of scorched for ingredients.
---
This still happens to me. Has happened for as long as I can remember.
---
Did you ever find a fix?
---
My friend. If you launched the nuke. You can place it anywhere you want. Regardless if people get mad or not.
---
i usually hold x to unequip
---
they are still dropping from both holiday reward pools. I finished getting the last one today. The Christmas fur lined jacket.... 14k XP being a bush wookie took 11hrs of game time
---
Just hit 20 today. I’ve tried to use as many XP bonuses as possible along the way and I don’t think it’s too awful of a grind. I’ll more than likely change my mind around 40-45 though when the grind is nearly double per level.
---
You are not alone, plenty of people hate how hard it is to get ballistic fibre, going to all the military camps in the cranberry bog, then clearing out fort defiance should net you about 50 ballistic fibre. If you are really struggling the equip white Knight,  
---
Are you able to farm the queen, I hit her regularly and end up with loads of repair kits which I then use on my armour.
---
From what I can tell it is. My budget was the same with the old free states vendors and now with these.
---
Berserkers weapons do less damage as you increase your Damage resistance.
---
20, though I technically should've been 26, were it not for auto-completing challenges...
---
Take off all your armour and then check
---
A lot of places here (*in Canada at least*) have a thing with turning old buses, caboose cars and the like into little dinner sort of things as tourist attractions. I can *sort of* see what they were going for?
---
If anything else, it definitely increases the packs value. Given their pricing for a lot of things, I'm surprised the train car wasn't sold by it's self for 1500 Atoms...
---
Yeah I hear you. I fear it will not return tho...
---
Aw, I thought I had to twist my controller in a rage until the plastic seams split and the screws fly out.. Oops..
---
its a pain tho sometimes won't even let me reload
---
A low level character stopped by my camp and started buying all my cheap plans, I felt like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons.
---
I run a junkies double barrel shotgun and it one shot everything but scorch beasts
---
Berserker damage goes down the higher your damage resistance...
---
it happens rarely for me. i just deal with it. Even in the middle of a SBQ fight. 
---
they might fix it one day
---
Perfect, thanks alot for updating me.
---
You could always use a headset and area chat and communicate this before the event starts or during.
---
I mean what are the chances of anyone seeing this who it might apply?
---
This year doing fashnacht I had an instance where a player or players put all their PA on the bridge to block the bots. I thought it was annoying but also funny so I jumped on top of them to take a picture for my gallery. Buddy boy with a sn rhyming with she squawks starting going ballistic and squawking on the mic. He screamed that I was a r*tard and a piece of shid and all the things for dropping my armor on the field. He said I was reported and going to be banned and all this and that. The PA ended up being recalled and the bots finished their little trip and we got our rewards. Actually that match I think I got old man winter and he ended up downed at the end of the match. So all in all a good day.
---
I love how every day here it’s “Bethesda please stop being god awful and fix x and x and also x. Why are you guys terrible?” and all that was shoved to the side when a Doughnut-colored robot at a booth hit the atom shop.
---
I know I've seen cabooses done up as cafes or ice cream shops a few places before, so it's not entirely unprecedented, but not sure if it's a reference to a specific one
---
Yeah, I used to have a vending machine at my camp specifically stocked for low level characters.  I crafted a bunch of low level gear, stocked it up with purified water, stimpacks, radaway and 10mm/.38 ammo.  I put a sign under the vendor that all the items were free to new or low level characters.  A little to one side, I put another sign for donations and people would occasionally drop low level supplies or legendaries that I'd pop into the vendor as well.  At the time, my camp was set up really close to Vault 76 and new players would wander through and pick up a few things.  Then for almost two weeks straight that vending machine got completely wiped out by high level players.  I'm talking... level 10 leather armor and pipe weapons for the most part.  I'd keep 15 stimpacks stocked, so it wasn't like there was anything of legitimate value in there, it was just greedy people being greedy people.  So, I stopped doing that entirely and ended up moving my camp to another location.  There are definitely some good people in this community, but there are a lot of shitty ones as well.
---
Oh that would make sense actually. Thanks for sharing that. There’s not really such things here in Denmark lol. 
---
But yeah i hear you.
---
28. I'll be 29 as soon as I finish the NW Weekly.
---
I want the gasmask with a lamp that I saw on the data mined post. is awesome and the light of the pipboy is ugly tho
---
It's not a quest line as such.
---
I don't want to do spoilers sorry
---
You find the rusted key
---
Use the rusted key to open a door
---
Read the note &amp; terminal
---
Pick up holotape
---
Go to another location 
---
Use holotape in terminal
---
Go to another location
---
Use the now changed holotape in another terminal

Use the information on the terminal to locate a safe with a key pad.
---
Which when opened has the key to dome 2.
---
Which has some secrets inside 
---
Sorry for being so cryptic
---
An interesting thing is that the cultists seem somewhat split between the worship of the Mothman and the worship of the Interloper, so perhaps those could be the two factions that end of fighting for the worship of their crypto’s of preference becoming the main religion of the region.
---
it happens to me a lot on pc and the only way i can correct it is to just fire a shot at nothing and then it works
---
These new display cases are neat.
---
If you're gonna hide and not play, go solo.
---
chairs menu for the seating, stairs menu for the stairs, etc.
---
They were at launch, but automatic weapons kick total ass now. Try a sneaky commando. It utterly shreds.
---
i feel maybe those fortune tellers from Wavy Willards can make a good vendor, maybe redesigned to have like a raider theme  to it or something similar.
---
Ps4... I know im not op but im the mechanic for my low level team. I drop like 1k weekly on ballistoc repairs :\
---
Definitely in the subreddit, but it would render vendors in-game nearly worthless, if not completely worthless.
---
Getting the lost crates only increases the amount of caps you get in the end, not the chance of getting better loot. I don't even bother getting the last one sometimes if it's being elusive.
---
... what did I pay for? This game works too well!
---
damn you're already past the spaceship playset thing on the Legendary Run too... nice.
---
People in this sub complain way too much.
---
I absolutely agree - the gate area is the perfect "pause" button so you can run ahead to get the other two supply crates.
---
I log out 5' to and in 5' past. Everything ok so far
---
The rusted key that opens the room above Freddy’s house of scares?  Just tell me, spoilers or not please.  This is the first I have heard of this.....everything I have read points me to the rail yard lockers.  Now they changed it?
---
&gt;nothing works properly they do.    
---
     
---
wut
---
Oh no! The totally over powered end game boss and it still takes 5 to 7 shots before you can kill it.
---
The Kidz Zone is a nice touch. Too bad there are only what, 3 in the entire game? lol
---
If you stand just over the drop It can't be taken
---
Doing every challenge for daily and weekly should have brought you around 18. If you did the repeatable for 100 score multiple times you could easily have gotten a few extra levels.
---
 Stack intelligence buffs and exp buffs and the 10k exp for the repeatable isnt hard to do. Also unyielding armor helps a lot because if you have the max buff with a full set, minimum life, you have +15 intelligence right there.
---
So in a nut shell, a lot of intelligence and exp buffs.
---
If you want a larger breakdown of how to max exp gain during the end game I can elaborate.
---
Oh true, my bad
---
A defend against NPCs counts as well.
---
That would be a dream! I would love to fish out of many of the rivers and ponds around Appalachia. It would be awesome to hang up my RadBass or GlowGill in my bar. It's an awesome concept, but sadly I don't see it would be implemented.

Just made 41 I can feel the slow down lol
---
At least with Radiation Rumble the event doesn't fail because people are busy just killing ghouls. I think at worst you get a lower tier reward for not turning in ore, but I'm not even 100% sure if that's true or not. So long as you can take out the ghouls fast enough and/or have someone on healing duty you can just run the clock on the event.
---
You don't drop junk when you die while either of those events are active. You must really be making bank.
---
Yea, it’s probably just dream for the both of us lol
---
Stims, radaway and water are dead weight right noe
---
They originally put the key on the locker by mistake to get the rusted key go to the cemetery where buried with honour is head west until you come to a destroyed house on water with a tent next to it. In the water is an open safe with an alien blaster and the rusted key then go to Freddie's and follow the clues.
---
Yeah, it would definitely need some animations with a fishing rod. I would hate for it to be added and all you do is go to [Fishing Spot] and tap X.
---
That's a good point, that is a good one for low levels.
---
Me to.
---
I just want to jam out to my tunes, man.
---
The antipvpers are insane.
---
I found that key and the blaster.......where do I take the key to now?
---
You replied on the wrong post I think
---
Had this happen to me many times on public servers too. Glad to see it's a display bug at least.
---
The question was if it was going to remain the same every week.  Some places were speculating it would change from week to week.  Maybe become completed public events or something else.   So some people were suggesting using the lunch boxes right away when we knew it was exp
---
I wanted a train car that I could build in, and that's the bonus for the set so they granted 2 wishes today. Lol
---
Edit: its technically a caboose, I should have said.
---
Cheeeeeeaterrrrr! Just messing, I don't care cause I've cheated in this broken game too:p
---
From my experience, when you fast travel to your camp while it is not rendered, your character will spawn on a camp that is not there yet -&gt; you'll fall. Fast traveling again should put you at the right spot. I build my camp at the top of a mountain and learned that the "hard" way.
---
I guess a simple solution would be to let the game render the camp first before placing your/any character on a spot ...
---
If you get mad at dying when you have a bounty then...don’t get a bounty.
---
I feel like I'm playing almost perkless right now
---
Have you sever hopped? Usually fixes it.
---
I was so hoping it provided fresh donuts each day :(
---
You just made me smile with the thought of the existance of such a device thank tou very much
---
Uuuu I’d ride the wedding dress train around appalachia like crazy!!!
---
I actually like awol for this. I got a whole mess of bulked junk from someone last week.
---
"I am the great Wendigo"
---
No. Only explosive harpoon guns went away recently.
---
Well, expeditions are coming to the game which give the devs ALOT of freedom to expand lore. We may see small areas of places like Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee or places that we have seen before like The Pitt (Before the BOS scourge, where it's described as Hell on earth) or DC. 
---
The way I see it, expeditions will keep this game alive for years to come. I would love to see my home state of Kentucky after the bombs.
---
Bravo good sir!...Bravo!
---
Im curious where this is. I have built and been to many places under the map and never saw anything floating out there like this.
---
Just unlocked the winter paint for one of the armors so you’re good to go.
---
I always have 10+ dailies activated whenever I log in. It’s been like this for months. It’s like going through hell to untrack them all one by one.
---
Probably b/c is seen as a low level area, and not a source of flux - or there was an event like feed the people going on and there were low level players there.
---
When you decide you need violet flux, and want a different enemy set than the usual places, hit Toxic Valley.  Full of violet.
---
Get Wavy Willard’s into the mix for ghouls and such.
---
I think its still active. Finished my fur Winter Coat 3 days ago.
---
$$$
---
For those interested in it  here's a Short Youtube Vid (not mine) showing them off -&gt; [https://youtu.be/nN4rwngDg-0](https://youtu.be/nN4rwngDg-0)
---
Sleeping all the time whilst making you kill raiders who stole a bonesaw to help their dying uncle.
---
Then tells you they have **plenty** of them
---
Go to Freddie's upstairs and unlock the door as I said previously then follow the clues
---
Yea I believe it's called tank killer but I don't think it works as well if I remember right
---
yeah I unlocked it yesterday, spent the last few 5 hours building so have yet to touch todays dailies or the new weeklies yet.
---
Nice, when you say just, you mean within the past few hours, right?
---
Nice reply. I think the dude you replied to has never been to Meijer's.
---
I would have no problem paying 500-800 atom for the item itself. They would have gotten money no matter what lol
---
even more annoying when you are melee-ing a mob....
---
Sorry? What makes you think I'm a cheater?
---
I saw him sleep perpendicular to the bed once. An absolute madlad.
---
I guess you like big butts and you cannot lie? lol
---
Like 6 minutes ago lol
---
Just...why?
---
Moving the camp module is not super reliable, though. Since my camp is at the top of a mountain, there wasn't a lot of land to build on so I had to use a lot of concrete floors to have some space. Now, my spawn will always be set on the most north-eastern concrete floor no matter where I place the module. It's a really good thing because if I had placed my camp at the top of that mountain while not placing any floor, I would have respawned at the bottom of it ... making my camp completely innaccessible. (happened the first time I got up there)
---
Oh wonderful, thanks so much! I just wanna complete everything before they finally patch it lol
---
why not pay it forward instead of trying to hock it?
---
Radicool, nerd rage, bloody mess
---
Did he sound young? Probably was a kid
---
Im pretty sure action boy/girl still works
---
Yep. Twice (exited game, went to capitol and repeated process with same "unable to locate required files" result.)
---
lol people sleep on the submachine gun. its actually really good if you get a good roll.
---
i have a b25 that absolutely rips though everything.
---
Given that it's the skins of at least three humans, melted together then tanned and laid out?  
---
I dunno, it'll probably bring the room together.
---
14, I think.  
---
Ya got work if you want to eat and keep a roof over your head.
---
Morgantown highschool tends to spawn 4 dogs at the start of the game
---
I almost cried.......
---
Thank you for this. Made my day! And If I was there I would have marched
---
Eek. You may need to abandon and start over.
---
Gauss weapons are so broken on so many levels - it is my only real complaint about a fairly buggy game.  If you are going to have a buggy game, combat should be the main priority - the only thing that should run smoothly as a bare minimum.  I'm not sure why it is the way it is.
---
I'll try tomorrow,  I am on my way to work, thanks for the suggestion.
---
With all the issues they’ve had with duping using stashes, having another stash would probably just bring even more problems to an already broken game
---
If you don't power it doesn't do the song or dance. You can just power another vendor if you want to be on the map.
---
Yellow and blue flower dresses, sequined blue dress, swimsuit, mistress/torn dress. Can't think of any more.
---
Ghouls are immune to rads but not disease. They'd get infected just like anyone else without an inoculation.
---
The community in this game is truly one of the better ones out there. Welcome fellow dweller!
---
I always like to see just how long I can last while communing with the shrubberies.
---
You have the kid play zone thing and glow in the dark wallpaper. Pretty sure those are way up there on the board if I remember correctly.
---
Yeah that makes sense. Thank you for the answer
---
That looks really cool.
---
if it goes pewpewpewpewpewpew it's commando and if it goes pew pew pew pew pew pew it's rifleman
---
To go with this I'd really like the option to build an outerwear version of the various underarmors. So many of them make good female outfits but you have to run without armor to see them.
---
Atom stuff in camps would stick out
---
The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
---
My apologies, I just looked and saw they're lower than I thought.
---
ya know because i think of a train caboose when i have coffee and donuts...
---
I could see Bethesda doing that and i actually got mad at them for a second. 😂
---
If rifle goes "pew pew pew" when you fire it is automatic. If rifle goes "pew" when you fire it is semi automatic.
---
Hehehe.  Thank you.  Gotta love looking at fish after you grab your Faygo.  :p
---
I don't think so, one of the creature types you collect a sample from to create the inoculation is a feral ghoul. And ghouls never show up as scorched variants if attacked by Scorchbeasts or spawned by the Queen.
---
It's the osmosis kits he says they have plenty of. After saying "the last" when sending you. The bonesaw he says they've just never had to use. 
---
(Unless those lines are random, in which case it's even worse. 😑)
---
Get naked then go out fighting
---
woo im gonna by 1 .308 round
---
I’m pretty sure ghouls are immune. During the inoculation quest one of the things you have to do is get samples from creatures immune to the plague, one of those things are feral ghouls.
---
At least the NW one is easy, but adding the daily NW into the weekly is sneaky.
---
And a daily limit of only being able to make 1 keyring a day
---
Right? The whole "I have a degree" argument is pretty stupid to use here especially when he just admitted to having to google it anyway lol
---
What's up with all of the "1." comments? Am I missing an in-joke or are there a bunch of bots commenting?
---
When was atom shop made cannon?
---
Hunting only counts for Legendaries, correct?
---
Use adamantine skeleton or fire proof to stop it.
---
Don't you mean building?
---
Jump and vats.
---
I expected it to be linked to our inventory and we could just turn in the unwanted ammo in bulk and then select the type we wanted. It took me forever to exchange ammo for points having to do the selection process over and over and over. I'm glad to see they'll be revamping it.
---
Yeah right? Definitely the first thing that comes to mind
---
As a bush wookie I would love armor and the ghillie skin. Just the suit on iys own is what im rocking
---
Mmhmm, I don't even loot the SBQ until I find the nearest tent. Died way too many times to a mirelurk hunter, king or a stingwing.
---
I think only feral ghouls and a few other creatures have a resistance to the scorch plague, not immunity, just resistance. I believe it’s stated in the main quest line.
---
Yeah but I'm pretty sure you also collect mole rat blood, and they can be scorched. Which is why I don't really know what to think
---
Damn I'm on xbox sorry
---
Ok. I just figured that it would a base damage of 134 like my non-legendary with all the same mods
---
Wouldn't the extra INT from building party be better? Unless you happened to come upon a legendary convention and there's dozens of them i feel it would be better getting more xp from normal mobs.
---
Yes. Forgive me.
---
I very clearly say I am not trying to change peoples exploration, all i ask is for them to clear their mobs. If everyone clears their mobs, the issue is resolved. I recognize that telling people how to enjoy a game defeats the purpose of the game, but asking people to clean up after themselves so others can enjoy the expierence doesnt sound that bad to me. As for the event, absolutely high lvls do them but its also bethesdas fault for making only certain events that give treasury notes, there are only so many chances to get them in a day. But also I dont see a point in you saying you never met unappreciative players. I have and how does you not having expierenced that change my expierence of the event occuring? With regards to a private server, that defeats the purpose of the online game. I enjoy players but not when they do things like this. Vast majority mmorpgs in my expierence have seperate monsters with fixed levels seperated by area, very seldom does it scale with the player like in fallout. As I am not asking people to change how they expierence the game, only to kill the things in the game like you are supposed to, I do not see the benefit of playing on a private server.
---
Do u know where I can find that info?
---
No worries
---
stop shooting at things 2 foot away.
---
Of course people have heard of the great Rammadeus! They are the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now, or something....
---
Yeah was only rank 19 for the wallpaper, spaceship was 25 iirc.
---
Ah, a fellow ass man.
---
Nice job, the only downside to this bundle is now EVERY camp I'll ever make will be a retro 50's diner.
---
If you liked other prefabs (especially seed shed, or circus tailer) you’ll probably enjoy the train car. It’s not for everyone but it is certainly neat, and probably looks great at many railway camp locations (like the R&amp;G station with all those trains... aww yeah)
---
Like when you have to load the Master Holotape (or whatever it was called) into various places manually. You have to scroll through all of your tapes and hope you see it because it doesn't have an icon next to it (from what I can remember). I dumped all of my tapes and notes into my stash because I don't know if I will need one at some point even though I know they're all junk and I will grab them again anyways. I wish that notes and tapes could only be grabbed once per character and not be able to be discarded unless they are tied to a quest.
---
Because they're very accustomed to being the literal gods of the sandbox, and can't accept something killing them.
---
Yes both event and building groups are better
---
that's a weird way to say building team (8% with max bond for every enemy)
---
It's alright. Howd you get so much?
---
Very insightful, but what about laser rifles. They can go pewpewpewpew or pew pew pew pew
---
No it is not. That's why people won't join hunting groups. It's not 400% times the xp, it's 25% per player in group.
---
Building team gives intelligence= more experience for everything.
---
But legendary spawns aren’t guaranteed and infrequent to come by. What is the benefit of this team choice? Asking bc I’m curious why they made this team bond an option and am I missing XP.
---
You get an 8% boost from building. You get 4x(400%) per legendary kill for hunting.
---
Building is only better than hunting if you kill 50 regular enemies without finding 1 legendary.
---
im crying this is amazing LOL if i was there i would of been laughing so much..
---
Good ideas but wrong company. Bethesda is way too lazy.
---
Just give the thumbs up or heart emote. The person probably doesn’t care what you do with the items they gave you lol
---
They could have let players buy it seperately as well as being part of a bundle, it would still have been a good deal.
---
Idek where mine came from
---
A very consistent broken mechanic is when I enter PA or go ingame with PA, I reload at unbuffed speed even though I have both Speed Demon and max ranked L&amp;L, easily fixed with weapon swapping but really shouldn't be a thing
---
Pretty sure it’s a bug
---
I never specified what was in the store right now though, I was talking about the store in general since launch. So your argument of whats currently available was void.
---
I'm not ignoring anything, you did that by only using what was currently available. 
---
You can't even name the serious stuff because there's been basically none of it. Good looking weapon and armor paints are few and far between. And the only non goofy stuff was the free states and responders bundles, but unless you like those factions, they might as well be grouped with the cartoon stuff. 
---
Some of us want black, gold, and silver colored weapons and armor. We want our characters to look like they're serious and ready to survive the wasteland, not just returning from a theme park. I'd like my camp interior to look like I'm an adult that didn't collect all the novelty decorations from the local toy store. If 8 can build a fully functional suit of PA or advanced energy weapons then there is no reason I can't construct elegant and nice looking decorations that reflect a more advanced style base.
---
Yeah this bugs me no end.....
---
There is an outhouse. I have it. I got it from atomic shop months ago though.
---
There’s a terminal in the AVR Medical Center, it’s part of the quest “Ounce of Prevention”
---
Nothing wrong with that...cept the jukebox will be playing classical, lol.
---
Some... but a good amount of weapons and armor
---
it only says +100% xp in the hunting team blurb.
---
Killing 1 legendary in a full hunting team is the same xp killing 50 regualr enemies in a building team.
---
OURS IS THE CRY OF FASNACHT!
---
Thank you good sir
---
It says 4x for me.
---
That's the one made from a stack of tyres and a molerat? I can imagine what Sophia would say to that! 🤗
---
I've been fully closing the game to be safe and still got hit by it.
---
I get this with the bow occasionally you can pull left trigger and release it again to unset it too
---
As far as I have tested they DO NOT snap with the Red Rocket bar set. I was very disappointed.
---
Hey bethesta how about you return all my 1500 atoms that disappear from my account  when  the last update was released
---
Thats funny
---
None of us do - we are all just Todd's playthings...
---
Give me more cool shit to build that I don’t have the budget for 🙄
---
Just to confirm: when you learn the mods by scrapping, you still need to equip the 'gunsmith' perk (intelligence) in order to be able to modify the higher level guns. I just want to make sure this isn't the issue that you are having.
---
Yeah, but in those we could just console unlimited cures in and be done with it. Or mod that shit out.
---
Not an option in this game. :)
---
Before the quarantine I purchased many WWR to store for busy weeks. If i only had 10 minutes to play I just traded them for scrips.
---
Now I have lots of free time and too much weapons weighting 0.5 or less.
---
We all just work to keep up todds amusement of the physical realm

---
Nothing worse than walking through the wasteland, minding your own business, when BAM! Molerats pop up to nibble on your shins and you have contracted rad worms and then they burrow back for like 10 seconds while you wait with your gun out to 1 shot them. Annoying little fuckers.
---
Got glowing skeleton 10 min ago
---
Base bonus +25% xp for legendary kills
---
1 bond +50% xp for legendary kills
---
2 bonds +75% xp for legendary kills
---
3 bonds +100% xp for legendary kills
---
That's what it says
---
:DDDD No it's not.
---
It’s one floor tile wide inside, three tiles long, with beautiful wood interiors and ceilings.
---
Stealth commando with vats crits is the most dps build in the game rn. But as always, depends on the quality of your weapon.
---
you have managed to exhaust my knowledge of the pew. 
---
I googled. Apparently lasers can be either depending on the receiver.
---
Thanks for the help but i was just being stupid, tried it out at my friends camp which ofcourse wouldn't work hahaha.
---
I also bought it during steam sale. I had actually zero expectations because of all the bad reviews etc, but it's been my go to game since I bought it. Fantastic.
---
As fun as that would be, I don’t think combat is nearly right enough for that
---
“Our Water-Cooled Saw is on the body of a dead Raider 5 feet away… Finally, someone with the *guts* to help.”
---
So it's not just me who isn't getting gatling gun mods!? This has happened at least 3 times, it makes the sound and says I learned a new mod but where the mod's name should be on the upper left of the screen it's just blank. It never happens with any other weapon.
---
Bummer - I didn't hop back onto the game until the beginning of April.  Must have missed it.
---
And conveniently it is also not in alphanumeric order to make the whole experience just a little more terrible.
---
Its not, I have gunsmith 5/5 equiped pretty much always, as I like the reduced wear on my guns. Even if you do not have it, the mods you learned still show up they just aren't lit up that u can install them.
---
I want a quest to make those fucks go extinct. I swear, if they pick up your scent they'll follow you right across the map just to shit on your boots.
---
Wow... so that’s why we got samples of wolves (gigantic face palm)
---
They should use some of the abandoned Raider camp locations as event gathering places for PvP. Like, if you’re in that vicinity you’re open to PvP and give it a time limit.
---
u/undeleteparent
---
I do sometimes wonder about the dev team's definition of camouflage.
---
im missing the last one for Christmas rewards even though i unlocked the skeleton skin
---
I stopped playing before fallout 1st released and remember laughing when I saw they pulled that move. But I came back to the game a little sooner than you did. Couple months before wastelanders released. Leveled up an alt for the first time to try a different build which kept my interest going. But my stash was full. Weapons and armor I knew I could sell or trade for a lot taking up space. How could I free up my stash? No more junk. I bit the bullet. I got fo1st. And I do not regret it.
---
I am on PC with some mods. The challenges were update one by one before today, weird but working.
---
I can help you out.
---
I also get that glitch where it says "unlocked *Blank*"
---
But I have all of them already unlocked.
---
I'm 15 and I played quite a bit this week to get that. Not something I can maintaine though out the season.
---
I love the flavor of the week in the Atomic Shop.  My vendor character is all set up with a 50's style theme.
---
Lol know what ya mean 😂
---
I'm still at 0/7 so its not that. I checked. Only mod I got on mine is the high capacity magazine as I looted the mod for it somewhere.
---
I think it's because 99% of atom shop items are pretty shit and not worth spending atoms on. So when something good comes out, people get excited (:
---
😂 She is high maintenance.
---
Hell no.
---
Maximizing gainz via buffs
---
Public teams: Basically you need a good team leader or yourself to constantly be switching between building and events.
---
Mutations: Herd mentality mutation, egg head mutation. 
---
Perk cards: Inspirational, strange in numbers, night person
---
Aid: Anything to boost INT like brain fungus stew, or Mentats/bufftats. Then craft up lots of cranberry foods like relish or cobblers or juices. Herbivore will double those buffs. If you’re carnivore, scorchbeast brains or squirrel stew. 
---
Gear: Most will likely try full unyielding for +15 to INT right there
---
So if you can get INT to like 20+ the rate of exp coming in will be fast and furious. Also switching to get maximum event exp.
---
Berserker are perfecto for the chinese stealth armor
---
Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality Dolores?
---
It's 25% per player in group :D The 4x means 4 times the bonus, which is 100% in total.
---
Hahaha mine also likely is there. One time my game glitched and it was busy attacking Bessie and the brahmin at the Wayward. Real awkward.
---
Farming camp McClintock and the car right down the road from it has 2 peices, as well as fort defiance.
---
Good to know
---
Worked fine in Update 19, it broke when they rolled out 20. But yeah your not othe only o ne I have scrapped 15+ and still at 0/7 even thou it said multiple times I learned one but name was blank. its like, the script is there to learn one, but someone messed it up and removed the line for what mod the script points to. Of only the game had full modding, a modder could fix this in less than 5 minutes, hell I prob could and I suck at modding.
---
Haha, Ward is so awesomely bugged. Reminds me of the [time i found him sleeping outside](https://imgur.com/a/kP6nyTM)
---
Thankyou!
---
basically if you pull the trigger and it fires continuously it is commando. And if you pull the trigger once it's rifleman. You can mod rifles to fire both ways

It's in the bundle now, so they can sell it again seperately in 6 months.
---
Someone bought exactly 1 shotgun shell from me. The notification actually made me laugh. :)
---
Have you checked the in game setting to make sure the slider is turned up?
---
Don't worry. It will come around again. Make sure you check the camp category in the shop not just the featured stuff. I'm waiting for items to come back too. 😂
---
Same thing happened to me today. Logged onto a private server about 5 minutes after reset and saw only 4 daily and 4 weekly challenges. Jumped to a public server and saw the missing ones had autocompleted, except for the claim 5 workshops one.
---
When you last played, was playing NW the last thing you did before logging out? Just curious if there's any consistency, as playing a few rounds of NW this morning before the reset was the last thing I did.
---
When I first saw it I thought it meant direct trade, so I wasted a bunch of time trying to find someone to trade with. Then it dawned on me that player vending is a thing so I traveled to a camp and bought one 5mm round for 1 cap completing the challenge.
---
I got a 14000 xp reward, but it just said I unlocked 'glowing skeleton hood' :\\

Meh. Too much work to save 3 animals for not-so-good rewards. Just one animal fine for me...
---
Teams have made this worse for people, I was in one earlier and I swear there was 18 people in there....... before it was 3-6 on a regular day.
---
Just trolls most likely
---
I got the weekly to pop on a new character by completing other challenges lol
---
Yeah this is also common in America as well. I dont understand why most people don't think a diner a d train cart are related in some way.
---
What’s your tips on completing it fast? Do you do any xp buffs? (Like canned meat stew or cranberry relish)
---
Also true
---
How much damage are you doing?
---
I'm running bloodied power fist that can do 10k
---
But you never need that much, a bloodied LMG would be a better dps.
---
Fur winter coat. Is this the last reward? I got Xmas presents/dead tree/wreath/bats weapon paint/jack o lantern weapon and armor paint/hunting rifle holidayrifle wrap/nw beanie/glowing costume w skull and a few others I might’ve missed. No fur coat yet though. Assuming I should keep grinding NW
---
This happened to me last night too when I started a new character. Only lasted for a few minutes but it was annoying. And I’m a veteran player with 2k hours, the hud wasn’t turned off in the settings. It ended up fixing itself, but I don’t know how or what caused the initial issue.
---
Thanks for a advice. I kinda prefer the prime bcz my camp is pretty close and obviously sbq event guaranteed daily. The only struggle I have is to find the best place to harvest cobalt ones. For now is between the UTV and the Foundation. My official record is 18 stable from the UTV.
---
Water Wookiees are my brothers.
---
You cant reload, cant switch weapons, cant use stimpack when it bugs out.
---
You can bash to remove the bug tho. Still fucking annoying
---
No, just farming west tek.
---
Functioning UI is coming once the games out of early access
---
Her name is Betty, and she’s perfect.
---
Yeah the fur coat is a good 7k after the beanie. Takes awhile.
---
The Slocum Joe vendors snap together so that they form a countertop and it helps to make the wiring look neater.
---
Bump. This needs to stop.
---
Sounds about right, and the constant spamming of group invites gets annoying fast, especially when said players normally treat anyone lower level then them as non existent
---
Fight club
---
Agreed the UI needs reworking imo, I use PA and that team notification popping up over my AP bars is kinda annoying, not too mention the MASSIVE splash screen every time I win something or complete something, usually at a critical time too.....and when in a full team the icons and hp bars protrude too far to the middle blocking view on the left.
---
Oh damn. Thank you! Here I am wondering if I’m doing this for nothing. Appreciate it!
---
Opacity? The opacity slider is maxed
---
Morgantown’s great for flux farming, especially cobalt
---
No, here's what it has: Alien plushie, Captain Cosmos bed, Captain Cosmos helmet, Captain Cosmos suit, Satellite dish, The Invader, Untarnished paint (alien blaster).
---
Oh Bethesda... ever since you release this patch my system started crashing every single time... can you imagine how annoying that is...game broken completely. I What have you packaged in? Lots of features I don’t use anyway, it’s nuclear winter where all the fun is... today is the first day since the patch release it does not crash and i wonder if this is an anomaly... afraid to turn it off in case it starts crashing again :-) 
---
..: oh no, spoke too soon - black screen of death again...
---
and by the way, please fix this idea that team is dissolved every time you leave actual game scene and move to main menu. It is annoying to keep adding your team mates every single time. This is another great ‘feature‘ you packaged in...
---
and why can’t you allow for people to see friends list whilst joining to server is being initiated...that ‘join nuclear winter’ message comes too quickly and you don’t have time to view friend list to see who is on so perhaps you can invite them to join the team
---
and that issue where ‘cannot place camp - overlaps existing area’ issue is still not fixed. Even though camp is kms away..
---
 (these three last ‘features’ are easy enough to fix, though, we just need an ETA from you guys). Enough rambling :-)
---
My specs are good old Amd fx8350 12 Ram Radeon R9 280x running on sabertooth 2.0 MB and hooked to LG monitor via display port. Sometimes I get flickering screen outside of game, but nothing as bad as after this patch. Upgraded to latest win10 2004 build and running latest Radeon 2020 drivers 20.4.2 - still does not seem to make any difference.
---
" I've lost all my nuka tapper saves" sounds familiar :P
---
Did you join a private or public server when you first logged on after the reset?
---
Same. That’s because the Christmas outfit requires a lot more XP:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
Seasonal rewards are at the bottom of that page. Back to the grind!
---
Lol. You kno for claiming you want your camp to look like an adult lives there, you sure are acting like a child. I only gave right now examples bc im not gonna sit here and list every single atom shop cosmetic that adheres to your very narrow criteria for what constitutes ‘good’ cosmetics. But the fact that just off the top of my head i can name stuff like the nukashine PA and fancy bar sets that match your description of **black, gold, and silver weapons and armor** and **adult decorations**, to a T just furthers my point that youre simply ignoring everything else and exaggerating the cosmetics that you hate. This game was not created for you and you alone. A cosmetic shop has to cater to a wide range of player types and they have the data on what sells and what doesnt. If they make more money from the cartoony stuff theyre gonna keep adding stuff like that. If that truth isnt good enough for you tho, by all means, continue to scream into the void and see if it works, meanwhile im gonna continue playing the game and enjoy when things i like hit the atom shop and be glad other ppl like the things I dont bc we’re all trying to have fun here.
---
This is literally brought up with every patch and in the last year I have been playing I have never seen the answer be yes.
---
Not true. Flatwoods is in the no-nuke zone and has been since "Beta".
---
You and me both
---
Whack, it feels like I’m melting through my rifle every time I use it
---
They may have been farming the ghouls for the event.  This would imply holding onto the ore until the very end to not complete it early.
---
It could also be that they are afraid of the deathclaw rush, but as long as you have good equipment and or designated defenders it should be fine.
---
Thanks for confirming! So happy it’s still active haha
---
This is incredible although it, sadly, only ranks in second place. 
---
Top spot will most likely always be the dude who blasted Yakety Sax during every single SBQ fight he was in. That was fucking hilarious. :D
---
thank you!  the reddit needed this.  now the hard part is erry day haha!
---
Turn the gun around, you have it pointed at yourself.....
---
;)
---
No. They are in the middle of a no-nuke safe zone
---
This is the content that needs to be on this sub. Keep on having fun dude!
---
8. Not worried, though. I got the rewards I really wanted already.
---
Is it explosive? Cuz that wrecks weapon condition
---
I logged in today with 3 daily and 4 weekly completed without giving me score.  Legendary run was great in theory, but suffers from the normal Bethesda promise of “it just works”.
---
Wow dude, you just took it to a new level. I like it!
---
1-2 people guard one hall way while 1-2 guard the other. 
---
1-2 people go for the ores or alternate places with the guards.  Try to resist putting the ores in until there is enough to complete the event unless you don't mind the additional enemies.
---
It is but I’ve been playing with it for a while and it’s only just been noticeable
---
Yall motha f****** need jezus
---
It’s based on the receiver you have on it. Idea an auto receiver it’s commando
---
I went to a players camp earlier, and soon as I arrived he greeted me over the mic in a thick pretend yanky southern accent, he proceeded to show  me around his new cop stop doughnut shop , it was quite amusing but his accent got annoying so I smiled and left him to his other customer.
---
There are daily and weekly challenges. They used to reward atoms but now instead reward SCORE points. Either way, it goes towards getting cosmetic stuff. You can see what challenges are left by opening your map and clicking on challenges.
---
It is also a good idea to get the wastelanders quest-line done as soon as possible (before worrying about other quests). After you complete it, there is a daily rep grind which will take around 1.5 months to complete. So you might as well unlock this grind early that way you can do it while doing other stuff.
---
There are some outfits which are rare/extremely rare. It is a good idea to look up which outfits are rare so you do not accidentally throw them away.
---
I just wish we could have multiple perk loadouts so i could swap between combat and crafting. Doing them all 1 at a time is tedious.
---
Lol no shit they have to cater to everyone. 
---
Do you think I'd have anything to complain about if the stuff I felt was worth purchasing was added? I realize people like different stuff, I'd like it to also be my turn every once in a while. At no point did I say this game was made only for me and that it should cater exclusively to me. Its not childish to have preferences or be upset when there's a constant lack of cosmetics to your taste. If the roles were reversed everyone would be up in arms about not having anything they like to purchase. 
---
I  have the fancy bar set, its one of yhe best things they've ever added
---
I run a shotgun build and the explosive damage is oddly weaker than just using a regular. I oneshot 98% anything in game and never have to worry about  limb damage or take up space for perk to combat it.
---
Happens to me every time I do that event man :/
---
Think it said 27 days left
---
Those will be the "fixed" ammo converters. Dump unwanted ammo in a get mystery ammo back.
---
I figured as much. Thanks!
---
In addition to this, even if the original event would have been to defeat multiple waves, you will only have a single group of enemies to get rid of. 👍
---
Your nuke. Your decision.
---
All fine fellow dweller, if someone getting mad about it they are free to launch one on their own.
---
Yeah. Thanks. For now I know how to exactly to nuke the UTV and Whitespring to harvest yellow, flourescent and cobalt. Violet and crimson was never been a problem bcz of sbq event. high-rad fluids and other stuff I collect in Whitespring. In this zone I collect up to 40 kits for all rides I do. It depends only on other players in the zone. And notice that u have to Nuke only public servers bcz on private ones the result aint same for harvesting mobs.
---
One more thing - keep in mind that you get exp boosts the higher your intelligence. So you might want to decide how high you want your intelligence score to be and focus on leveling that up first.
---
Oh wow, that's great! I'm glad you're still working with it. Did you decide to incorporate the crit parts too?
---
my god that would be phenomenal
---
manage your junk well. Keep a small amount of common stuff and more of the harder to get stuff.
---
This guide can show you were stuff is found (pre wastelanders so some info may be wrong)
---
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
you could wait until you max your storage or start getting in the habit now of not picking up everything. 
---
If you haven't already join the tadpole scouts and do the quest to get the backpack
---
Sucks like hell, its becoming a pain to find good ways to farm legendaries, mainly for scrip though occasionally i find something decent
---
Why not just bump up the point values for the challenges by, like, 50%? The grind will still be there, but you're not borked if you miss out on playing for a couple of days in the 10 week period, like some of the calculations have shown would happen. Hell, have challenges switch over to giving out Atom points after you hit level 100 in The Legendary Run.
---
You don't let them come back and collect their stuff afterwards?   You monster.
---
(That said,  I would take the stable flux and jump off the server)
---
It's a girl for me?
---
Yes. Repair gear and workbenches. The amount of people who think you need repair kits terrifies me. 
---
Also spend a lot of time exploring and just having fun. Don’t take things too seriously.
---
If you wait until the end to turn in the ore the mobs don't get harder 
---
If you are at 0 ore level only glowing ones come 
---
Level 1 death claws. 
---
Level 2 FEV floaters 
---
Level 3 snallygasters.
---
So basically some people wait until 30 seconds or so left to turn everyone's ore in so the mobs are easuer for the full 10 minutes instead of getting tougher and tougher
---
Working my way down the list, so not yet.
---
You are correct. Taking doesn’t. Defending does, and more importantly retaking does. Retaking takes about 2 minutes. Defending takes way longer.
---
Right way is to guard and gather quickly, legend farming is running the timer down while people are holding ore. Both are viable options, just depending if the group wants in and out or not.
---
You monster.
---
Dude I am level 102 and I have only completed 12 quests. 
---
The vendor aspect is all I have been doing/what keeps me playing everyday
---
Yep, that's the one. I can't play without it anymore.
---
Same. Another guy posted a good tutorial, and even offered to help. Not the same platform though.
---
Lool mine wouldn't stop fucking screaming nonstop for no reason and throwing boulders into my living room through my door or Windows
---
I love hated him so much
---
I've had issues where the ore nodes stop refreshing, after turning in I had about 85. After that I ran the tunnels again I they seem to be refreshed.
---
I'm pretty sure I was the only one collecting since I grabbed the rest and completed the event.
---
I usually wait until the very end to turn in, but decided to do so a little earlier since they weren't refreshed.
---
Really ? Lol
---
Same issue. Was 5/8 and 4/7 complete at 10am. I took pics but didn't send them in. Let me know what happens please!
---
My camp is far away from the usual traffic but even I’m leaning toward getting this to replace my vending machines.
---
I've still not got anything usable using my script 😂 one day though ... One day
---
I mainly build up my camp the whole time I play and I consider most of the score camp rewards shit 🤷‍♀️
---
Ah, heard. Well keep me updated! And if you need any help or anything, just ask!
---
Public
---
Thank you very much! Was wishing for the retro alien posters, but alas..
---
must be your main quest.  got the rose message hundreds of times until i finished the quest.
---
damn fine coffee
---
One other thing I noticed is that you can loot just about every corpse even legendary and get their rewards. The only time I stop to swing my weapon is to quick heal an NPC that looks near death.
---
Hmm must have completed it a few times with more beasties alive. My bad. Thanks for clarifying
---
Don't be a dick.
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talks
---
Damn, so same issue but no consistency really whatsoever between us. So annoying...
---
Question about the fix for the adrenaline perk:
---
What do you mean by ranking gun fu?
---
Do you mean to fully rank a new gun fu card?
---
You need certain lenses to zoom.
---
To everybody that this happens to, please submit a ticket, every time it happens. Bethesda needs to be made aware how bad the problem actually is.
---
I almost have only legendaries to scrap for scrip in my stash (as we are limited to trade every day), the junk is in the scrapbox. And it‘s laggy on my xbox one x with a 400 MBit/s connection.
---
Yeah I saw, sorry about that. I was only meaning it in a joking way to begin with cause I thought you did the score glitch, but I take it back and I apologize haha
---
aye. great event. Good for gearing up lower level alts as well.
---
If you have a coordinated team you can hold off putting the ore in until there's about 30 seconds left. Gives more time for killing things. 
---
ALSO! Some non max weapons have value. Mostly bloodied. People use them until they can get something better. So watch what you're scripping
---
Too many donuts and your ass is the size of a caboose.
---
But I've completed the main quest. Pre and post wastelanders. It's a side quest thing I believe.
---
How can i obtain these lenses
---
Im mainly hording mine to use to get 3 star melee weapons (hoping for bear claw)
---
And prepping for when i craft legendaries and try to get the secret service armor legendaries
---
Ah, my apologies! It took me a while to correctly credit you cause it kept saying the user didn't exist heh :)
---
I don't know why it's so addicting! I just love finding a rare legendary or rare outfit and selling it, knowing ill get a nice profit. It gives me a reason to keep crafting stimpaks and drugs too.
---
Or the ammo converter, or the handful of other perks they broke...
---
That is some quality scrip
---
....funny thing is when I saw it did make me think of coffee and donuts and how I miss going to the train cafe in WA when on the way to go camping. I guess they changed ownership and it is a lunch/dinner restaurant with a  bar car and hobo inn now.
---
When they had the “add a floor or wall decoration to your camp” I sold out of all my decorations (I specifically don’t list mounted heads, ultracite armor or night vision scopes - cause everyone else does...)
---
Edit: changed ultra cute to ultracite- but I don’t carry those either
---
I agree. When I’m fighting ghouls I just know I’m gonna get rad worms, when fighting the queen I know I’m gonna leave suffering from the Blight. I know there are cards to help reduce the chance to get diseases but it still shouldn’t be so easy. 
---
Maybe make it so if your low on health and get hit due to being damaged. Can’t be full health, fully fed get sick after a scratch.
---
I love Twin Peaks!! I agree, that Slocum Joe set would definitely help make a cool version of the Double R!
---
That's quite a haul. I usually get 0 items from that event because I spend the whole time collecting ore. One of these days I'll get the rad barrel plans and then I can actually shoot stuff too.
---
There’s one lense from completing the quest, then there are random plan drops from the overseers robot guy, the picturing of stuff at crater/foundation.
---
Theres a slinky grey dress?!
---
I believe you have to finish the bucket list quest where you take a picture of 7 locations on the map.
---
Not wearing off would be an _upside_ if you want the AoE damage effects from multiple diseases. Having all of them at once would be insane
---
Yeah, I only ever use VATS to find enemies, I can't remember the last time I actually used it to attack. Huge thanks to everyone that posted advice regarding using a shotgun.
---
In the early days this was a bigger problem. Its calmed down a lot I think.
---
For the most part, its generally kill everything as fast as possible, then when the supervisor shows up, let everyone tag him. Just from doing the event a lot, this is what I normally see happen. 
---
Any time I'm doing uranium fever with anyone under level 100 I ask if they want me to let them tag the normal miners.
---
I believe there’s a night vision lense too from the possum scout vendor
---
You're a life saver (score saver?). I'm not build for VATS so I rarely use it, so also rarely use critical. Gonna try this next weekend. May whatever deity you like smile upon you forever.
---
How soon after reset did you login?
---
Yeah it probably is. I tried to put on the atomic camo from 1st and I couldn’t even put that on.
---
Haha.  No.  Now that I think about it, I was thinking of something else.
---
about 5-10 minutes
---
I believe you are correct, I don’t look at the possum vendor much.
---
welllllll. have you got it active?
---
Let's all take a moment to remember that the BGS division currently handling dev duties was a previously untested studio that is currently working remotely.
---
Fast travel bug, no end game, community crying about anything and everything
---
Because countries other than America and Canada also exist?
---
I agree about 1\* crap from her. At least 3\* item guaranteed must be. And yes I see ur point. Withing a group of friends is more productive. I rebember how I ask a few players to get down from the fence in order to get her on the ground and in a few seconds she lands by herself... her corpse I mean. It literally was like 5-10 seconds fight after her 1st aproaching. And about looting her I always do bcz of .50 cal ultricite ammo and 10% of health  with every other aspect included. Never been epic my output damage but enough to loot her no matter how fast u guys kill her.
---
Black as midnight on a moonless night...
---
I did the same
---
If you want the schematic, go to Wavy Willard's and complete the quest to find a missing kid. It'll give you a legendary 10mm SMG that sets targets on fire as well as the plan to craft 10mm SMGs. Don't get your hopes too high regarding attachments, though; it's basically just barrels, stocks, receivers and magazines. No muzzles, no sights.
---
This game really needs a localised text chat feature, as the headset usage for this game is garbage, half the time i can barely make out what people are saying or they make too much noise because they dont mute their mic when not being used
---
As for tagging i do the same when people come to an event
---
Anything is good with a stealth build, I have one taped lvl 62 charred ghouls with pipe wrench using stealth
---
Right? I was never interested in taking business classes in school - maybe this is why I’m so interested in starting a virtual one haha. I’ve been using my subscription to fallout 1st by just farm g every workshop in a private world and selling bulk junk and scrap. I can rake in at least 7-10k in the span of two days selling junk/scrap/ammo. 
---
I highly recommend trying that as well! It’s been very rewarding lol
---
Welp, appreciate the update, because I'm at work.  Too bad it's another week of saving my atoms.  Maybe someday they'll have something I actually want.
---
Exactly bro! I'm glad someone else understands me aswell. Something has to be done, it's been around for  while.
---
Super Duper is working as intended, I believe. It gives you double the base amount, regardless of whether or not you have ammosmith
---
Wouldn't something be cheaper if it's easy to get? Why pay a ludicrous amount of caps if you can just get it yourself with a little grinding.
---
No, all my quests are deactivated. I only get on to do my dailies.
---
I see this question asked a lot in the subreddit.
---
In case you don’t know. You can already do that. You can put two walls in the exact same spot. Place down a wall that’s a doorframe first. Then place another wall that is also a doorframe and BOOM you have a wallpaper on each side. The down side is you use double the walls.
---
I think CoD may be a good substitute for that.
---
Haha. I have a lot of pics of him doing stuff like this but never seen exact same thing. I honestly regret that I dint hooked up with the Crater doing 79 quest for now.
---
The door with the power armor wouldn’t open for me
---
That thousand yard stare when remembering the 400 weight limit or endless server hopping to get the camera when every other challenge was taking pictures.
---
21 but I have not done any NW challenges, but if someone is using that tent exploit in "Line in the sand" then go do it, take a weapon that can tag all mobs an explosive weapon is best, take any xp gain items you have too, and try to be in a fully bonded team, I made 3 levels in one event earlier 247-250, crazy good xp in minutes. I'm a lazy PA user too so I'm not even maximising my xp gains so I'm sure you can get even more levels for that event if you do all of the other things peeps are talking about here.
---
Well hell I didnt know that, I dont like the double budget use but I will be doing that lol. Thanks
---
For nuke zones lasting longer than 4 hours, call more ladies.
---
It works with an event team...I maybe shot half of those but my team members got the others. This is one of the biggest benefits to teams.
---
kinda but no id be a missle launcher
---
I don't use it often either. Almost never for CRIT but I do love spending less time doing these things! Glad I helped a few wayward VATS souls 🙏
---
To be frank, each person deserves their own opinion - but as someone who has played Fallout for a long time I sincerely hope this is not the direction the game ever goes.
---
I don't understand, why is it so important to do the weekly before reset? Is that some kind of exploit so you can do it twice a week at the risk of losing Score due to bugs?
---
Gun Fu works a little like adrenaline.  It switches targets automatically in vats and gives you a damage boost on each subsequent switched target kill. Max rank of 3 gives you the most boost.  10% for for the first, 20% for the second, 30% for subsequent targets.  An additional benefit is that switched targets (excluding two shot weapons) are virtually a guaranteed hit.   Even a rank 1 Gun Fu card gives a 10% boost to all switched targets.
---
Now THAT is a proper nuke. That makes the smaller one look like a firecracker.
---
Or just allow existing walls to have paper on both sides. No need for a new object.
---
I have a bloodied 2* Gatling gun for sale. Seeing if I can get 7500 for it. Have seen high vender prices from others and hope it works since I use fast travel a lot and buy ammo I always have 4000 caps or less
---
Heee haaaw heee haaaw..😂
---
The ‘office’ area by collector Bravo is a pretty popular spawn spot. In the hole in the wall, of course.
---
You can sometimes get a sense it’s going to spawn when there is a lull in the miner mobs. Then I head to Bravo and switch to a sword. I just get a swing on it and signal to “come here”.
---
But lately people are been such jerks about mowing them down before other people get a hit on them.
---
Such a shame because most of the community in the game are nice and genuine people then people like this come and ruin the experience
---
Wait until you see what happens when a Legendary Perk procs, which is every other bullet with ones like Follow Through. I hope you like a big pulsing trading card taking up the space just above your health bar, complete with annoying little noises.
---
I recommended they stop that or make it an option to hide it, but it hadn't been implemented on the PTS.
---
Maybe contact bethesda instead of commenting on a post someone made about the atom shop update? They have been decent at refunding folks but commenting here won't help you in that process at all.
---
They made one thing clear. In post-apocaliptic world the only way to survive is being a rader.
---
The cap tax keeps you from doing things like circumventing the cap limit by buying 5.56 ammo or something else worth 1 cap and banking that
---
Too many donuts and your ass is the size of duchess's* FTFY
---
Visual bug that has existed since NW was added.
---
When you were running around, was it actually that large?
---
Great idea, but in the back of my mind it stinks of another way for dickwads to figure out a new dupe method.
---
I think all cameras can zoom.  Some mods allow a greater level of zoom.  The key to zoom is your vats key.  Press it while looking through the camera.
---
Still no Fixer skin, sad.
---
Do headshots count as critical hits?  Or do you have to use vats?  I’m not a huge vats user, so the crit one might be a challenge
---
+1 - do not rush through the story line to “catch up” to others you may run into.
---
Each person deserves to discover and adventure through the world at his or her own pace. The devs released Wastelanders this past year which was a great add and hopefully is setting a precedent for new content in the future - but you deserve to enjoy/experience the world on your own terms.
---
26 on main, 20 on alt.
---
Currently I have rank 5 adrenaline card
---
And rank 3 gun fu. 
---
I was wondering if you were saying to like I unequip gun fu and get a new gun fu card and rank it up again?
---
I’ve been seeing people saying to re rank up cards.
---
Thank you for the response
---
Depending on if you'll go digital, I'm sure the marketplaces on digital stores will have better deals than Gamestop. 
---
Also, I just looked on Amazon and the GOTY for Xbox is 34 while PS4 is 25.
---
That train car is gorgeous. The interior is really damned nice too
---
Well, i had a lengthy response to this but then my app crashed and i hav no desire to retype somthing im sure will have no effect on your opinion on this matter. But long and short of it is, there **are** cosmetics that fit your extremely specific wants and **that is the point**. Everybody wants something different and not everything u dont like is all for made for somebody that might like one of them. I liked unstoppables but dont care for free states or captain cosmos. But just bc its been 2,3,4 or more content drops since one came that i liked doesnt mean theyre catering to some 1 other player type thats not me. Bottom line, there **are** black and gold weapon and armor skins, there **are** adult non colorful camp decorations, and claiming that your wants for the atom shop are being ignored is just objectively wrong.
---
It works with the barn wall, concrete wall, and metal walls. I don’t think it works with the wooden walls. But once you place the walls down, you can always just edit them and switch them out to wood or anything else.
---
Where you thinking of the person who tells you a nuke is coming in adventure mode? ;)
---
I made it to fireworks as of last night.  Won’t have as much time to play this week so won’t make it as far on week two.
---
They always do. Don't be manipulated by Bethesda's FOMO tactics.
---
Doing my NW daily today (place 3 camps) led to 2/3 weekly NW challenges completed. Just weird...
---
...maybe...
---
It's 250 points holyshit lol, you'll probably earn more than that from the repeatable XP weekly while doing your dailies 
---
I played for a couple hours and triggered the repeatable weekly 3 times just doing the other dailies, wasn't even trying to XP farm
---
That's 600 bonus score
---
It's really not that big a loss if you don't do it
---
It would be more "anti consumer" if the players who enjoyed NW had no way to earn score at all, what about those consumers?
---
The season pass still heavily favors your play style
---
We got 21 after 6 days, but had a casual/non-grindy day yesterday and are at 22 after week 1 (haven’t played today yet)
---
EDIT: typo
---
Rank 3 of adamantium skeleton removes all limb damage.  Fireproof 3 removes almost all explosion damage, including the sonic blast from the SB/SBQ.
---
You are correct in noticing that Enforcer does in fact increase the chance of crippling yourself.
---
Dude - having a “level up” requirement every day and every week is frustrating as shit when you’re level 200+. I don’t want to have to make an alt or grind crap every day just to get those points.
---
The NW challenges are (barring the “Rez a guy” one) painless and easy to get.
---
Point is, there’s something for everyone to hate in this new Season mode.
---
Well I'm definitely getting other peoples' junk somehow. I thought everybody does this? Happens to me literally every time I die while i'm out and about lol. I was doing an event solo just yesterday and this guy comes in last second for the rewards, and I happened to die at the end of the event. He grabs all my junk and leaves. I was mad at first but hey that's just how the game works if it happens so often right?
---
I thought the legendary run was account wide...
---
I’ll certainly do my best lol
---
The way I judge games...and this could be just me. But if I think I can spend 60 hours playing the game then it's worth buying. And trust me you will spend 60 hours playing that game. Even the base game without the dlc that comes with game of the year edition.
---
Speaking of outer walls, we need the trailer walls that build the Wayward.
---
I'm disappointed it didn't
---
Technically sure, though I would quibble on the security part considering Gail takes her out to play in dangerous locations because she is a brain damaged savage who could be easily overwhelmed by wasteland predators or even a few careful Blood Eagles; my point is that it would have been nice to rescue her and take her to Foundation.
---
Bethesda could even go the route that many modders have done: combine hairstyles. 
---
Maybe have 2 or 3 hairstyle selectors so we can mix and match hair that we want. This is especially good for facial hairs as some people want a detached mustache with their beard
---
Probably alternate account
---
It's 1000 points actually. Already losing 250 score per day as is. Adding 1000 isn't a small loss.
---
So happy to hear you don't have termites! We had them once and they're (showusthebutt) really hard to (showusit) get rid of. 
---
What Swedish (showus) band was it?
---
wire it up with a switched pylon
---
If you bought a Bethesda game thinking of PvPing 
---
Thats on you bud.
---
It kinda sucks because I’m away for the week and apprently you can barely miss any challenges if you want to hit score 100... guess I’ll be buying tiers :/
---
Still only 9. The game just got too tedious for me to care about doing it daily.
---
Bahaha isn't that the truth for every content update Bethesda does
---
So there’s zero benefit to using the sneak perk card when agility is over 30?
---
Has it been tested in a video anywhere?
---
YES. I dont mind Nuclear Winter but I want that with a team deathmatch or capture objective and respawns. I love adventure mode pvp because you can seek revenge and get right back into the fight. 
---
I really hope they add something like this. Battle Royale is overdone.
---
Jebus. Good on you.
---
I'm only at 16 doing everything except the NW challenges and getting at least a few XP repeatable ones per day.  Guess I will finally try NW this week since they went ahead and added a weekly challenge now.
---
I honestly didn't know that was an option in NW.  I'll check that out.
---
Oh right forgot they added a weekly, sweet! I don't have to feel guilty about playing NW instead of XP grinding
---
This.
---
It works fine for me...and I need it to being a shotgun build
---
This land's idea of liberty leads only to imperialism. See through the lies, comrade. Fight for the party.
---
Never open locked containers (of any type)  in unclaimed workshops, you'll become wanted
---
Nice, I need to try that for myself. Why farm junk when others can do it for you lol
---
guess I'll try giving it more of a buffer next time
---
Haha this whole mishap had me cracking up
---
Ahhhhhh totally missed that joke sorry
---
The nukes a metaphor for the rank achievement alert and Bethesda is placing it wherever they want, aka the middle of your screen... that was deep man
---
I do have a question. What does AA mean? I tried googling it and couldn't find an answer but people use it all the time here
---
I'd love some smaller pre-built structures like that
---
The double budgeting sounds scary but if youre smart with it, it's not too bad
---
After all you're only doubling the interior walls
---
I hate nuclear Winter with a Passion but I actually find enjoyment avoiding fighting others and finishing the challenges like it's a solo mode.
---
 Some of them you can finish and then leave the match without finishing the match they are so easy.
---
Like I said I hate it as much as you do but I am not missing out on score. I'd like to get to level 100.
---
Exactly this.  I do the same.  I then do angry emote at said player.  People need to get used to tagging legendaries.
---
Amazing
---
It’s even worse with the diseased robots lmao
---
Yes pls, I hate like 80% of the male hairstyles and I don't even know what's going on with the females
---
Zax? Yeah he's pretty evil but not the symphatic way like Farcry villains or MODUS from the enclave.
---
Wait, seriously? You can farm hardened mass there?
---
In my case.
---
**Serendipity**  always works for me.  While I am in **Power Armor**  or not somitimes 2 shot weapons dont work as entended.  **Action Boy/Girl**  doesnt work.  By breaking  **Adrenaline** perk they f\*cked up my play style.
---
I'm actually on 22 would have been 25 but most of my challenges auto completed today. bethesda cannot give people points so.. As long as i get the other glow in the dark wallpaper im good
---
The millisecond after they introduced the Playtime power armor.
---
When I was level 18 I was building up a workshop after completing the defense quest, and immediately got hit in the back with a mini-nuke by a level 180 in power armor. He looted like 2 hours worth of junk from me. Went into mic and said that was a jerk move and he could’ve just asked for the workshop and I would’ve given it to him, then he went into mic too and told me to “go stick a tampon in”
---
Sadly the Strangler effect deal so little damage its  doing -nearly-  nothing in fights, but its cool to hear things making  noises behind walls from the acid effect "hurting" them, also the skin is very badass on some PA skins
---
I’m working on my diner camp right now. Looks great so far. Got it split with one side Slocum Joe’s and the other geared towards Red Rocket/Nuka Cola. 
---
I do have one question if anyone has an answer, how do I get the door that comes with the bundle to work? I have a backroom designed to be like a kitchen and want to be able to attach that door.
---
But does it vend?
---
A lot of people want adventure mode pvp completely removed, but then they don't support any kind of growth for other pvp content. "Go play nuclear winter" ...I do, and its not the same, nor what I want. 
---
Let's support more content.
---
I actually think this would be kind of a cool add. Not sure how it would work, maybe 3 simultaneous silo runs to launch a bigger warhead or something.
---
In vats i have more accuracy than without activating it. And it is damn insane how it works while i have AP.
---
Same just not much left good in there once you get what you want.
---
This is such a BS challenge. Bethesda are openly admitting that they have to prop up NW since even the daily NW challenges alone aren't doing it.
---
Nice finds!.
---
Most I ever got from one event was monster mash. I had well over 10 legendaries by the time it finished.
---
 Sometimes I do that event and 0 show up.
---
 RNG can be fickle.
---
I’m still waiting on the Responder Power Armor to come back now that I can finally afford to get it.
---
It exists, but I don't know of a place to find it regularly.  The plans are usually on the watoga vendors and mods at grafton station, but they are random and don't always appear.  One of the best non-legendary armors in the game is the BOS Combat armor.  3 pieces of it can be found at the end of the glassed cavern, on a BOS corpse near a small satellite dish.  It is close to the exit that leads to the elevator on the right.  You can find 3 random pieces each day. IDK maybe you would be interested in that.
---
Thinking I did too. I completed quick and it popped up again.
---
I would love to get some more tattoos as well. I remember there being 'Children of Atom' tattoos in fallout 4 DLC that I would love for them to import to 76. Also, body tattoos would be amazing.
---

Blocker is working when you’re standing and not crouching...so if you’re not crouching it should be doing it’s job...it would help if it visually/or through audio, procced like serendipity and ricochet do

28 right now...should be 29 tonight.
---
Do i need the plans for a copper collector or whatever if i wanted to put my camp near a deposit ?
---
That's a scorched pet for ya lol
---
I called him Big Stank
---
It's in the camp section.  Half price too :)
---
I played one round of NW and finished that so 🤷‍♂️
---
I completely agree with this. They also need more long hair styles. Right now there is only maybe 3-4 female hair styles that everyone picks because the rest are really short.
---
Even though this game has its bugs and all it is pretty fun and I have a blast just by myself since my friends think it's a shit show from start to finish
---
If you want to spend the caps go for it! But I see it in player vendors for 250-600 caps almost daily. Buy the plan and mass produce it! Good luck be safe and have a good day.
---
The amount of good shit you get in that slocums joe bundle is insane
---
Waiting 7-10 days kills me when i can barly wait 2 days but if its GOTY for 35 im all in.
---
At 16 as well, also not doing NW, and hitting repeatable XP. Really looking forward to a double XP or double dailies weekend.
---
Yup. This is how I set up my [vendors.](https://imgur.com/a/Nm9AOz6) Turned out about as neat as I could have expected.  
---
\*EDIT\* lol wrong imgur link, fixed.
---
About 35. Its about 1850 a rank for me now lol.
---
There were 8 Weekly last week too - 7 1-time for 7500 SCORE and the repeatable 10k xp. This isn't a bonus, it's a hard push from Bethesda to go make people play NW.
---
It's easy to farm legendaries it's just that the odds of getting the exact roll you want is low thus making good rolls more valuable. by maintaining the maximum of 30,000 caps per player you are working against making things worth absurd amounts of caps only buyable by the players who have said amount of caps.
---
Building camps is probably my favorite part of the game.  I get teased for rebuilding often.
---
It's not really bonus. This isn't an extra new weekly, it's just one of the standard 1-time 7500 SCORE that we had last week. Except now it requires you to go suffer through NW matches even if you hate them.
---
Yes i've played this game it took me a week to finsh (Don't judge me) i had a really good time i just want that good time back because im bored at the moment. And i have no internet beacuse my dad is a mega boomer.
---
Maybe not for an American playing on US servers, but I notice it as an Australian playing on US servers
---
Thankfully this did not happen for me
---
The more ore you add to the machine the harder the enemies get.
---
 If you wait till you get nearer to the end of the event and deposit the enemies will stay the same.
---
 I personally like the challenge when people add ore along the way so the enemies get harder but that's just me.
---
Once you are high enough level for a perk card you will be able to pick that card. Just remember you can put a point into a SPECIAL say like INT and pick a card for perception. Hope this helps!
---
Just got one a hour ago.
---
The door is for the train carriage, it slides into the wall, it would be great if it worked on other doorways.
---
I saw someone earlier on this subreddit saying they were still earning stuff even after the shop update 
---
I stayed up all night and got the last reward at 10am so I don't know for sure, but I haven't seen anyone say that the rewards stopped so you should be in the clear lol
---
Nope, the relevant collectors will be available to you to build as long as your camp has a node within its perimeter.
---
Can we let them focus on one mode before we start adding others? Bethesda can't even add quality updates to the one mode they do have.
---
And sometimes rare items they don't know real value of
---
Curious, are the Vault-Tec NW event items in the loot pool too? There’s a stash chest, diploma, poster... from way back.
---
Spacesuits are designed to get soaked.
---
Ahh true.. true
---
God I wish that were me
---
I am sure there are videos of people testing it.  I am only speaking from personal experience, but I can tell you that I have tested this extensively sneaking around in the golf club/Westek/DMV and I find no difference at all in how often I get detected while AGL 30+ and with or without the sneak perk.  The only thing that gets me detected is if I swing/fire something loud.  Not running Chinese armor or Chameleon.  Just Unyielding SS armor and usually a power fist. Shotguns with suppressors are quite sneaky too. Death Tambo's, Combat/stealth knives and Flamers are silent.
---
If you are ps4 I will give you one. Plus bird bones and speed demon.....
---
[You know why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpdLdWqWyiY)
---
Shit...thanks for the heads up!
---
Yeah they are still live
---
Here’s the [complete list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj8wac/psa_here_are_the_nw_christmas_and_halloween/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Thank you for the response.
---
That would free up 3 perk points in agility!
---
I got question. Who is Slocum and why he have a cup of joe?
---
Totally broken. I stopped using it about a week ago.
---
Glad to hear, the bonus score sounds rad haha but if it happens again next week just keep in mind you're risking a lot of score for 1k
---
But if it works out for you I'm hella jealous bahaha I really want that hidden fireplace
---
thank you boys
---
Join an event team. Go there. Do the come here emote. They will see it. Maybe they will turn up. You only need one other to do it.
---
Does it stack with well rested?
---
I’m still wondering how they broke it, they weren’t messing around with any perk cards or nerfing anything. So wtf happened???
---
Death is so trivial in the game I can't imagine being upset by it. It's CAMP damage I care about.
---
Whenever I do the come here emote, my public team just gives me the thumbs down emote lol asses
---
PC? I hope so but kinda not because it looks like you're in my spot lol! Across from Slocum Joe's on the river by that rock outcropping? Right next to the npc camp that always shows up?
---
I've got FO 1st and have been hoarding stuff with the intent of stopping it when I've got shit tons of junk, I've got 7k plastic 70k steel  8k copper but only 766 ball fibre just to give you an idea of how rare it is as a junk item.
---
Silos have a fair amount of Ballistic fiber.
---
I think they toyed with the idea of TDM early on, when they also said that they weren't going to do a battle royale... dunno what happened there.
---
Wait whaaaat
---
What was this from and what tab is it under? I feel like I got it but not sure
---
Repost of old info, not much of any use for low level players.
---
And the gulli suit is still available to win!
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code
---
Finally. A gimp mask.
---
anyone got screenshots of what it looks like inside?
---
I've had this happen too. It's extremely annoying. No idea why but logging out with Forbidden Knowledge open seemed to override it for me.
---
It is called a "well rested" bonus. I will double check. Stand by
---
Edit: it does not stack and will make your "well rested" bonus into a "rested" bonus, meaning it is 1 hour instead of 2. Also, if you sleep in a camp with a loyal companion, you can also get the "lovers embrace" which is the same as "well rested". This also does not stack
---
get a new team
---
Yeah they only show up there if the paint is currently available in the atom shop 
---
That may be why you've never noticed it before, since for some weapons and armor months can go buy without an atom shop paint being available
---
Aubries been hitching about this bone saw for weeks now
---
Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don’t. That place is awesome for junk farm though if people do show up for the event. Plus who doesn’t want to chase Fido the Glowing Deathclaw around his enclosure?
---
I quit using it over a week ago.
---
There were vault raids at one point. But they were very buggy and where dropped a while back.
---
I'll give this a try. Thanks.
---
Lol, looks pretty dead to me. RIP all my high end pvp gear and guns.
---
I guess they are really struggling financially and have to resort to such things. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Or they just feel a bit dickish? 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Certainly am and certainly is, lol. I had a bar built here a while back, liked the spot and wanted to build here again, I guess we won't run into each other if you're like me and don't play til you find a server that your camp can be placed in :P
---
There are endurance perks I like better. Sunkissed removes rads pretty quickly, and means you don’t worry about what you eat. I also like rejuvenated, fireproof and adamantium skeleton.
---
With Seasons, we’re all trying to max xp, which means losing Lone Wanderer, and grabbing Inspirational and Strange in Numbers.
---
Suppressor seems so pointless; once I start attacking something, it’s usually dead before it gets a chance to hit back.
---
So many builds have Weaponsmith. Am I the only one walking around with 50 advanced repair kits?
---
I have a tent there it took a few tries to get it right but when you do wo0oo0 hoo xp,steel and ammo, take an auto explosive weapon, nuff said.
---
Happened to me months ago. Now I just avoid the store unless I actually want to get something.
---
It is your nuke. Launch it wherever the hell you want.  Who cares where everyone else on the server has to say.
---
 If they want a specific area nuked let them get off their lazy asses and do it themselves.
---
Last I checked they are there. Just have new icons.
---
I quit using it about a week ago.
---
yeah i wish you would be able to get a donut and cofee recipe
---
I drop nukes there on my private server. Farm for about an hour and get between 50-75 of each.
---
I'm not too worried about sights or muzzle attachments, I just want the drum magazine and a better stock. Has 25% less AP cost and 50% bonus to climb damage so I use it in VATS most the time anyways
---
Generally yeah - have a quick check of the map and see who's on. If there's lots of high levels you'll be fine.
---
SBQ fight is always popular because:
---
The event gives a legendary, and the queen herself is a legendary, so you get at least 2 legendaries from turning up.
---
There's decent XP from all the adds
---
The event gives stable flux as part of the rewards. So its free stable flux.
---
There are various plans that only drop from this event.
---
It doesnt need anything more complicated than simply "kill the queen", so people arent put off by wondering if there will be enough coordination.
---
Yup, it's broken. I had to change my perks around because of it.
---
I found rocksy lurking around foundation once
---
Are the new icons just blue like everything else?
---
This made my day!
---
Haha does it make that noise for real? Weeeeeeee!
---
Yep. Not my cup of tea, but whatevs. Thanks for changing things that we didn't ask for.
---
Yeah that does bug me, I have it in my Red Rocket diner currently and it's jarring. I turn it off whenever I log in and just keep it for aesthetics. They need to release a rockabilly jukebox sometime. That's be perfect.
---
I took out someone marked wanted who was a total piñata.
---
300+ screws, 200+ ballistic fiber, etc.  All bulked.
---
They chased me all over the map trying to start pvp.
---
PSA: If you're wanted, store your junk.
---
I remember going after a wanted player when I was level 45ish. I had a handmade and he was level 275 with some crazy legacy laser gun. It was at white springs, and he waved when he noticed me. I started blasting, he hit me once and almost killed me. I stim and jump around nailing him with the good old pre nerf tse. After a very tense thirty seconds he goes down. I pick up his bag and it so much shit in it. Totally over encumbered. Put on Excavator PA.... still over encumbered by 350 pounds. Panic time. He’s coming back, so I slowly walk and hide all the way to white springs station. Couldn’t even deposit it all into my stash. Had to stay at the train station for a week selling stuff to the vendor. Good times...... (this is when the stash box had less capacity and fallout 1st hadn’t been invented yet)
---
Are you building on your camp or a friends?
---
You can only build atom camp items on your own campsite - won't even show up on a friends/teammate
---
Damn. Alright, thanks.
---
That's on them for advertising it as one of the main selling points.
---
I’m vaguely annoyed that the new bars can’t snap to the red rocket bar set
---
Been playing forever, but just started Nuclear Winter for Seasons. I’m terrible at it, but still enjoy it. 
---
Today’s daily, build three camps, is super easy, (you don’t have to build anything, just deploy your C.A.M.P. three times. )
---
I recommend doing it right as you deploy, then start looking for gear.
---
It is in the "Misc. Structures" category, and is an Atom Shop purchased item.
---
More that I can't afford the high budget-cost of pretty wiring solutions.  Whatever uses the fewest conduits wins regardless of looks.  
---
(that said, I use a few tricks to get wires through windows/walls)
---
I was building on a friends, dumb mistake from me hahaha. Thanks for the tip though.
---
Seems like Endurance is a dump stat in these builds. Is it because of stealth or is Endurance just a crap stat?
---
No kidding, seems like a reverse QoL
---
Some liberty PA fan downvoting this whole thread
---
Get the escalator power armor if you tend to be a junk collector.    I’ve found it’s really easy to become overweight .. especially when you find that cool weapon you’ve been scrounging for.   Then all you do is slip into that excavator PA and zoom back to base.   
---
And to save on cores, don’t wear the pa all the time... just use it to fast travel when you’re heavy.... 
---
Also, bulk junk to make it lighter in your stash... and never pass up screws...
---
What if there’s a few pew pews missing?!
---
I move almost everyday! It’s my I’m done with dailies going to chill and build for the night
---
I tried that key but it wont zoom in
---
I dont know about the very top but you can build inside of it if you go through the gap on the left.
---
I took Hemlock, then went into an immediate NPC defense event, then rounded the corner to knock out a Grafton Monster. Got a workshop, an event, and a cryptid kill in the span of 10 minutes. One thing I am not clear on, tho, is the weekly quest shows completion 2/5 of workshops taken. Did the NPC defense count or is this an accounting glitch?
---
Absolutely loved the Fasnacht events. Pity too many level higher levels stealing the kill at the end.
---
Yo btw you're not losing score, just learned the NW is an added 8th weekly 
---
So it's 1000 bonus score compared to what we got last week and expected to continue to get
---
So win/win I think
---
Fortunately there’s no damage cap for launching players off a cliff yet.
---
20 but I haven’t got home yet to do today’s challenges yet.
---
FREAKIN' ADORABLE LIL BOTS!!!!!!
---
Lb not Rb...
---
Never Rb...
---
Rest in Peace Little Kitty I tried to zoom on but instead bashed to death with my camera
---
😭
---
I haven’t received those so I don’t think so but you never know
---
I’m actually glad the game forced me to play Nuclear Winter. I thought I would hate it, but I dig it. Reminds me of Survival. Build three camps takes no time and is worth 250.
---
There's a bug that makes the icons similar to other locations, and doesn't show you whether they are owned or not.
---
Doesn't happen all the time so definitely a bug..
---
One of my favourite camp item buys ever. It really adds to the vibe of a camp well. 
---
Plus I just learned, after having it for bloody ever, if you interact with it, it moves and shit.
---
Interesting. I didn’t know. Because I had a lot of high 90% miss on me.
---
Might have been a good idea to begin with, but Bethesda can't change course without backlash. Imagine how ticked off people would be when Season 2 comes out if the content that they could get before was locked behind F1st.
---
Sadly I'm on Xbox but thank you very much for the offer
---
21 I think. I’ve only missed one daily so far.
---
Okay yeah that's what I'm getting thanks for the info
---
I don't think you would be able to. I built there before inside the pylon, and I was a good ways away from junk pile. Someone else posted a few weeks back who also built there and they were upset about not being able to build the collector because it was outside of the build area, and their camp was up against the facing of the pylon. 
---
Think about your build area like a big sphere around your camp module, you can build anywhere inside that sphere. But, when you get close to the bounds of it, you're going to run up against the curvature of that boundary, so something that looks like it should be able to be placed might show up as being outside the build area.
---
The tattoo's look terrible though - i don't recall them blending in well?
---
So he’s a vending machine?
---
What’s the max you can store?
---
Yeah. I'm thinking about moving again soon
---
I've had it happen to me on Xbox not yesterday but the day before. I was online when it flicked over and it looked all fine then I jumped to a private world and had 3 out of 5 dailys auto completed.
---
(Sorry this is months ago)
---
I agree about the some bushes. Not all bushes can be bulldozed and they are the most annoying ones.
---
You might have to see a doctor
---
That will be my sexing time rug in front of the open fire
---
Extremely disappointed this was not a Rick Roll
---
How does PvP have no place? The whole thing about fallout is surviving the wasteland and sociopaths are part of that wasteland.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Floor decorations
---
Hey I tried to build one of these once and it didn't launch me at all, does it not work against yourself?
---
They've already said they were interested in doing additional rewards for 1st members but not on this first season.
---
This was a really good incentive to visit other camps, I’d like to see that daily come up often
---
Apparently none of you people are familiar with the wildly common train car dinner aesthetic. 
---
It's pretty classic Americana. 
---
I'm a bloody Canadian and know this.
---
I know, especially when they bulldoze the first time and when you spawn into a server the next time they come back. It's still annoying!
---
29.
---
Lore of Vault 76 is best ans brightest people... as humans, you'd think you would work together than against each other

Plus, PvP is shit in this game
---
Train car diners are straight out classic Americana.....
---
How do people not know about this?
---
Thats what im stuck at atm ,ra ra is just standing there staring at the terminal to let me in
---
Wait for a sale broski
---
Yes but they don't display well, it's just the same as how they look from your inventory.
---
Bloodied ffr first try. I’m a full health build. Wish we could trade items good luck
---
Switching to my mule and back to my main made it stop.
---
Yeah, they've got bots there building a vertibird pad and everything. Just stopped by it to check for myself.
---
This whole comment thread is absolutely stunning to see so many Twin Peaks fans.
---
I’m excited to see this as well! Keep us posted!
---
Dailies were pretty easy. Traveled to Charleston train yard and station, took out Liberators on the way, killed Grafton Monster, and defended Poseidon workshop.
---
I know that I just can’t seem to put clothes in them. Can you only put certain clothes in them?
---
"there’s something for everyone to hate in this new Season mode."
---
Truer words have never been spoken. Lol. 
---
That damn level up is getting done on my alt far more than my main. Still need to get the 2nd ending for the achievement so I might as well kill 2 obnoxious frustrating birds with one stone.
---
Tyty
---
Great guide thank you!
---
Because it's a neat event but requires a coordinated team effort, which most players will not do.
---
How do you get the raiders ps4 tag thing?
---
If you go to junk, switch to compoment view, you can tag things for search.
---
Ballistic fibre (military bags/military duct tape) is probably the rarest component that you will reguarly need.
---
Screws/springs/adhesive are all needed for repairs, and should be collected whemever you can.
---
Lead/Acid are the main requirements for ammo (steel is very easy to source).
---
Aluminium is something that is less common, but seemingly used in everything.
---
If you're finding yourself over encumbered, go check your ammo tab - lots of missions give missiles/40mm/mini nukes as part of the reward, and these all weigh a ton.
---
Similarly, under the misc tab, gunpowder and ore will weigh you down
---
AhhhOooooooo! It's how you knew you were home...
---
Recoil on two shot automatics get relegated to be turned into Scrip imo. 
---
And the accuracy penalty on non automatics gets the same treatment. Got a 2 shot Gauss Shotgun. The crosshairs extended almost to the edge of the screen. 
---
Basically two shot fucking sucks.
---
18 I think
---
We’re not all Americans lol. 
---
But someone from Canada said this as well so I believe you!
---
Edit: let me just rephrase that to: I had no idea this was an American thing. Never seen it myself
---
30
---
Convincing argument, however then so is my liberty prime skin
---
Oh, the reason for that is because someone that may REALLY WANT that train car will now have to pony up 15 bucks on shit they don't want in order to get it. Hence why its in there.
---
Upvoting for accuracy and the fact I just finished my train car diner not ten minutes ago.
---
The best route for completing this one (other than sheer luck, group-wise) is to use the looking for group option.
---
1000 if you take it all, 500 if you give half to settlers or raiders, 0 if you split it between settlers and raiders as they both would get 500
---
I dont like how this new SCORE shit is being shoved down our throats. I don't like feeling manipulated.
---
"So many builds have Weaponsmith. Am I the only one walking around with 50 advanced repair kits?'
---
Not everyone likes doing Scorchbeast Queen Events not to mention some Weapons break extremely fast without Wesponsmith such as Flamers
---
Some wont work, and some will only work in certain ones. Noticed today that asylum outfits don't fit in the Thanksgiving display case.
---
Perfect! That is the answer I was looking for. So at this point it's just a matter of tweaking my character the way I want and I'll have more options going forward as I get more perks and unlock factions.
---
Oh so that's why I spent part of Fasnacht getting harassed by someone who claims they used to work for the NSA! (I really wish I was joking.)
---
Yes. I have a mascot head that won’t fit in there.
---
Just give me a Vault-Tec backpack and a Vault Suit outfit already!!! :'(
---
It's also useful for stuff like radroaches, low level meele scorched / ghouls and other stuff that I really don't want to waste bullets on
---
Awesome, two birds with one stone.
---
Anti-Armor. It adds 50% armor penetration, which equals out to about a 28% damage increase per shot. For this build, boss battles are where this legendary effect really shines -- where you don't intend to one shot the enemy.
---
Dear Canadian,
---
I know. 
---
Sincerely, 
---
An American that likes railroads and their history.
---
Anyway some people use godmode to finish the season at rank 100 within hours..  it sucks.
---
Nice. I tried switching toons too but didn't fix it. I ended up grabbing some tech data as that quest glitches out a lot so I figured maybe one will out glitch the other. Worked out lol.
---
Hahaha
---
I play on EU servers occasionally and usually don't have too many issues. Don't know if I've ever been in AU servers though. I can join on your server and just deal with the lag on my end.
---
LOL
---
You probably right. 
---
But daaaaaaaamn I wish
---
Blursed
---
Wait what, I could have swore you for 500 if you split it with raiders and settlers. Its just their split gets smaller.
---
Are people annoyed with the train car?
---
(I searched traincar and found nothing)
---
If I get the camp message I'll definitely stop by before choosing another server, this camp looks awesome, well done!
---
I bought it because new camp items 🙃🙂
---
Gonna have to start milking Brahmin for those sweet sweet Fasnacht donuts!
---
You get 500 if you split it. The factions get 250 each.
---
It's the hits not registering that's the concern but it won't hurt to try
---
This needs more than just an upvote. This needs its own fucking topic dedicated entirely to it. And it needs to be pinned.
---
People are annoyed that it's only sold as part of a bundle.
---
Then let's tell the mods.
---
Same. And then I opened up dialogue to start my quest and the rude prick pulled a  Houdini on me. I had to go find him in foundation
---
Takes too long for little reward - especially with how much coordination is needed to even have a chance at rare stuff.
---
I'll go if i'm not doing anything else, but considering i'm only playing at most a couple of hours a day, and most of that is hitting all the limits for the day... well yeah...
---
I honestly think there’s a bit of charm in communicating with body language only, like in Dark Souls games with the various gestures you can obtain throughout your play through.
---
Bethesda just needs to give us some more like the “stretch out”, “rest”, “applause”, “shrug” and the “pointing” gestures in the Dark Souls games.
---
Edit: To the person who felt the need to downvote this. I'm not saying the game *doesn't* need a text chat, I'm saying that communicating through emotes can be fun sometimes.
---
Nope, I’m certainly not. 
---
Never seen it before. 
---
We have no such thing in Denmark of what I’m aware. 
---
Maybe seen a regular bus that sells coffee instead but that’s about it. 
---
But thanks for clarification on this
---
Or spawning in midair at a cliff. Broke my legs that way.
---
Pristine except for the inside of your roof. That sh*t will allways look horrible.
---
Ya well the best and brightest also caused the destruction of the world in this game so I would say it doesn’t matter, haven’t really done pvp to know if it’s shit.
---
You were doing so well up until, “Your welcome”.
---
It all depends on where the person is standing at. Honestly it only launches people like 25 percent of the time I’ve noticed. If they are too close to the front it won’t move them at all. And if they are too close to the back it’ll send them straight up into the air but not sideways. But yes, it’ll work against yourself if you stand in the right spot.
---
So uh ... can we even make or get doughnuts or coffee?
---
What I don't understand is why you DIDN'T buy the Mr. Pebbles plushie.
---
I seen a former raider running out of fiundation. I wonder if its one of the guys I talked into living there. Some bullshit musta happened and he was peacing out
---
You're lucky. After my third vendor visit withing walking distance, I bought 1 ammo for 2 caps. 2 CAPS!
---
try a different door. some are blocked and have always been
---
yesterday he was sitting in the bush outside of his office.
---
Random encounters I guess. But you will be doing hundreds of them to even make a dent.
---
Ohio River adventures has the mirelurk meat NOC for once a day rep. And Davenport for another daily but im sure you already did these.
---
Sorry but we don’t really have such things here in Denmark. So it made no sense for me.
---
Chems man, chems
---
Wasn't sure I'd be interested in the Slocum bundle when it was leaked buuuttt it's definitely worth the atoms.
---
When you can’t find your stash of caps and weed
---
Happened to me with the flyboy bundle by accident when my game froze last week. Submitted ticket and had my atoms back within a few hours.
---
It’s also been updated inside since the initial release of the game if you are going back after a while
---
Im not 100% either but the one I did yesterday still had the the scavengers alive toward the end but I was frantically trying to get more ore and I was focused on the timer so maybe they died too. I know if they all die it fails. I know for certain we didnt get enough ore because there wasnt enough collecting. Myself and the other collector didnt get there at the start. I had been wrapping up another event. If i got there at the start we may have gotten the ore part done, I dunno. To be fair though the last few of that one Id particpated in went a lot more smoother than it used to. This was only the 2nd one i had seen fail since public teams came in. If enough players are present to keep the scavengers safe and mobs under control its a lot easier but people still need to collect and that still seems to be an issue
---
I went there yesterday, its a bit different since wastelanders I think, but should be open.
---
Hm, well, the only reason I considered fallout 1st was because I could get that black armor from New Vegas in the beginning, but now that I'm ove 26 beers deep and keep on playing Fallout 76 I'm SERIOUSLY considering signing up cause of that same reason. But you know, still enjoying it as much as I hope you are lol. So, shoot, here's to hoping I don't regret it. Thanks for your reply btw. I knowledge my hypocrisy and highly consider Fallout 1st. Folks can change their opinion 'amirite? Haha
---
Nukes? That was to fight the Scorched 
---
PvP at best is janky and everyone uses the 1 shot bullshit so its pointless trying half the time
---
Not from a jedi
---
People like me?  What the fuck are you even talking about?
---
I mean it already is one of the best dps dealers out there
---
Yup, I had someone show up and saw 'soandso bought your shotgun shell'  I was amused.
---
Bloody mess, less than 80% health,  Andrenaline,  stablized,  adrenal reaction or just watch captain noob
---
Edit: forgot to mention nerd rage
---
Go to the main page of the reddit and click on the three dots in the top right. Should say something about user flair.
---
The crit one is killing me. I never use VATS (unarmed build), so I have to retrain myself to use it.
---
Nope, the revive one sucks. I skipped that one. The kill 3 creatures took me 3 rounds but that was fine. And I actually dont mind the sourvive for 30 min... I just hide underwater or in a bush while I look at memes.
---
Oh, did Bethesda not check with YOU before planning the challenges? You poor dear.
---
Question, can I make it 1,001 cars long?
---
Oh, yea, that one piece 1930ish swimsuit.  Bleh. :P
---
Sequined blue???  I’ve never seen that one.  Now I have (another) goal!
---
##PLEASE RISE FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM
---
Doot doodoodoot doot dootdoot
---
You spend your time and ammo blasting through the silo, drop the bitch where ever you want. I haven’t launched a nuke in over a year because the game crashed EVERY FRICKEN’ TIME i did. So I appreciate the folks that do. 
---
However, now with the new in-game teams, I noticed if the game crashes, I can get back on to the same server I was on before...might be time to try again.
---
F’N a cotton, F’N A!
---
your best bet would to find a way to place your camp halfway up the structure. if you can't jump/jetpack that high place you camp at the base and try building a stairway up to that midway point and see you you can place your camp somewhere up there.
---
Got it, thanks!

If you are using Unstoppable Monster, you should watch this video:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0raSbTxHfZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0raSbTxHfZ0) 
---
It is amazing what it can do....
---
how about... "little boi"
---
The observatory in savage divide was the same way...maybe the airport and things are getting ready for the brotherhood to return.
---
How do you view nuclear winter daily challenges? Do you have to go into nuclear winter to check?
---
Anytime!
---
No, that's capitalism.
---
It also includes the survivor stuff; ghillie suit and all that. That complete list isn't complete.
---
yeah.. about that food selling business..
---
dont quit your day job...
---
I never rush the Queen anymore because of this. I try to get up high and make sure everything is dead around me before picking up any more loot.
---
It might not be great if you have no interest in the rare plans that drop from it or already have them but its pretty selfish to ignore the objectives that result in those being awarded to those that are trying to get them.
---
Pro tip: Fasnacht donuts don't spoil. Neither does lemonade, for drinks.
---
Saw a camp vendor once where someone had actually done this, with many dozens of the above for sale.  
---
And that takes dedication, when you consider the ingredients list for Fasnacht donuts.
---
**Buffs**
---
well rested ( always have)
---
Canned meat stew (i have Carnivore so i get 10% exp) 
---
just sub cranberry relish if you use Herbivore
---
with the new lunchbox you unlock on the score map can get very well rested 
---
I've gotten as high as +75% extra exp but you cant stack the exp buff your self you need other people to open a lunchbox an it adds on to yours 
---
(i try to open one for big events like the queen an usually get at lest one other person to open one) i don't think many people know the exp buff stacks  yet??
---
**quest**
---
line in the sand  and  Guided Meditation  (radiation rumble is also good for this if you can get people to do it)
---
two of the best exp events you can do with the amount of things to kill you can easily do 2 maybe even 3 of the repeatable 10k weekly quest from one completion of it
---
( with the right amount of exp buffs) 
---
when i'm not chaining events i'm clearing
---
 ( generally you wanna clear any place with max level super mutants they give the most exp for easily findable things to kill i believe)
---
Huntersville -&gt; West Tek -&gt; General Steakhouse -&gt; Robco Research ( just for the  Sentry bot  outside gives like 900exp an its just a hop skip an a jump away from the steakhouse) -&gt; Pylon V-13 (clear town next to it) -&gt; Harpers ferry -&gt; Burrows 
---
( now while im doing all this running around im also stopping to hit fissure sites to kill scorchbeast &amp; scorched they summon in between hitting the main places)
---
 this is all from a lv 200+ player with some really good gear who can one shot most things so might not be as easy to do for a freshly 50+ toon

the purpose of an insult is to solicit negativity, so mission accomplished.  could also be that those that are quick to insult with something so unoriginal are just dumb and not worth paying any mind to.
---
I havent found a door at the main terminal area that wasn’t blocked off
---
I found him in Vault 79 on the day the patch was launched.
---
The issue is that in order to get the best rewards, you need all 3 creatures alive. If you want a creature to stand a chance of surviving, it needs to be level 1. 2 is better and 3 is ideal. You can fill the feeding trough to level 1/2 on your own.
---
Unfortunately, even if you have lots of people they ALL go to A, fill the trough to 3, then stand around with their thumb up their arse.
---
Which means at best, you'll get 2 creatures survive (presuming they dont manage to get the death claw killed, because that happens sometimes).
---
If you want to stand a chance at the better rewards, you need someone you can trust to go to the third biome and keep that creature safe.
---
I hit morgantown just for cobalt flux
---
Shhh ain’t suppose to talk bout that...
---
There was a Donut recipe available during fasnacht, as for coffee, I guess the tins of coffee that you can drink are close enough.
---
I loved the buildings aspect from FO4 and I've had some really creative camp builds ideas. My problem is that FO76's build system is so "finicky" I'll start building what I want and half way through I won't be able to get things to fit just right so I get frustrated and build a basic B camp. 😒
---
Adrenaline is broke right now, but I have that perk maxed. I don’t have power armor or perk points to use stabilized. Everything else I have.
---
I love the dressing gown, some more girly variants would be nice though. Its hard to feel lady like killing ghouls in a dark blue tatty dressing gown. A nice silky one would be good.
---
Being idiots?
---
Its the nickname I give to my shishkebab. If you equip the Friendly Fire perk, you can heal any friendlies in events with one. You are supposed to also be able to heal with a Flamer but for some inexplicable reason the only way it works is to bash the friendly with the flamer and not torch them with it. The shishkebab is far more convenient for the time being
---
Thanks, I appreciate it, I spent quite a bit of time on it, got a little budget left so still room for improvement if I find anything I want to change.
---
I don’t have enough perk points yet to get that. But how beneficial do you think it is for my build?
---
I just stored one of my vending machines and replaced it with the Slocum's Joe when I put it back down.
---
After that key you got to take a holo tape to a certain apartment in Morgantown...there’s YouTube videos that demonstrate where to go if you have trouble
---
21. Ive been grinding the XP repeatable a loooot though, and I've completed every single challenege so far.
---
20% more damage. A quick check of mine went from 270 to 323 per shot
---
suggestion: when you find it cheap, buy 2, especially if you dont have enough points in luck to have both starched genes 2 And superduper3 equipped simultaneously..
---
Nothing like swapping out starched genes2 for super duper, forgetting to swap back, them popping a radaway....and not being able to find a vendor selling serums at low prices.
---
IDK what low is on XB, but some players on PS4 sell them in the 200s.
---
Crap I counted wrong on mobile. Either way it’s super easy if you are doing NW anyway. Most nw challenges take less than 3 minutes.
---
I can’t seem to find that!  Anyone help?
---
Thanks guys. I tried not to bring another floater to the wastelands. And i put alot of thought into it regarding the looks and also the defense system. I guess you know that already, but i was surprised only two of those searchlights bring up the laser turrets accuracy to surgical precision lol
---
If you want it to stop maybe don't make a Reddit post whining about... Like a little girl? 
---
Real talk, there's an option to mute voice chat right?
---
When i'm 20K plus caps and don't really need more, i just use the daily caps to buy 5 lots of bulk ballistic from a vendor bot. Gives you 50 ballistic fibre.
---
They dont just wear out. Stuff does however come up missing sometimes. It's a scary thought when you think you could lose weapons you've grinded for a year to get and Bethesda doesnt care and wont do anything about it.
---
https://youtu.be/AZ1WYOqIabM 
---
Oxhorn video goes in depth for the three domes you can go into.
---
Thanks for posting this! Very handy to know before going in.
---
The American way
---
What are you doing to annoy them? Dont think I've been insulted ever, except by the bloody bot :-)
---
I’d prefer it be fixed
---
Haha i know what you mean. I went thru this process with all my chars before giving up on the mobile idea each time. At some point i started a static camp and suddenly 100 hours went into it and i didn't wanna let it go anymore &lt;3
---
That one is just the holiday loot, they reopened the challenges for the Survival Challenges as well.
---
Does it happen often?
---
I’m on the fence. I think it strikes a good balance as it is. You can blend in insanely well or you can have armor. It would be nice because I am a bush wookie too, but I can also see why they may not do it. They probably will though, as someone else pointed out, it’s probably a bug
---
No, it's a weird reddit glitch. I think it happens if you reply on mobile. For example, in my own reply I started with "21.", but for some reason the 2 isn't there.
---
(19) I can only play 2-3 times a week so miss a lot of daily challenges. This past long weekend is the only reason I've got that far.
---
I wish weapons with fire mods would proc "friendly fire" the fire mods for the Pitchfork, Perfect Storm legendary smg, Sheepsquash Club or Staff do not trigger it at all! Only the Shishkebab and the flamer bash!
---
LOL you *monster* !
---
Im surprised no one shot you after the event haha
---
I think they go beyond simply scorched - some of them are  charred :)
---
Wait, does it function like any other vending machine? Or does it sell Slocum’s joe themed consumables like a regular vendor?
---
Unless you plan on being in the fire I strongly recommend against it. It stands out so fucking much
---
If your stealth and really wanna go one handed which I don’t advise your best option is a bloodied swing speed plus strength combat knife with stealth mod giving more damage from stealth attacks if that’s what your used to all other one handedes are pretty poor quality
---
I purchased 1 beer directly from a friend's inventory.
---
I'm pretty sure Angry turtle was just referring to the fact that the card is not necessary if you have a sneak build because it's less common for you to need to tank hits
---
You'd think people would at least go to get it out of the way so the next event starts(Otherwise it's a long ass time to wait...), you're getting double XP if you're on an event team.... yet I'm the only one of all four full Event teams to actually show up!
---
Pretty nice freebie for those not buying the package.
---
i think your misinterpreting what im saying. It took geniuses to make nukes, and in turn they were used to destroy the world.
---
LMFAO
---
I have to admit that i am pretty toxic in rust  but that game is all about pvp.
---
23, done all the dailies so far (minus a few NW ones) but haven’t finished this weeks weeklies yet.
---
It was alot of trial and error before i understood that either. For the amounts of caps i wasted for replacing it for testing only all these times you could buy a decent legacy. Thanks for your compliment. Doesn't feel as wasted anymore now =)
---
lmao did you sit there and stew about it for 3 days?
---
you can keep pretending that reinforcing monetization wont cause Bethesda to introduce more if you want. i guess some people will do anything for papa todd XD
---
22... I miss muh free atoms...
---
What level are the legendary spawns I make whitesprings on a solo, and they are all 68s I think
---
Lmfaoo no way
---
Are we talking about the secret door on the top floor of the Whitespring main building? (The one that somehow links to the basement, despite there being no obvious elevator there?)
---
If so, I've literally never seen any other players up there, in the whole time I've played.
---
That was due to the rising tensions between the US and China due to the resource wars that escalated to nuclear warfare
---
We all had a meeting about it, you weren't invited. Sorry.
---
Maybe some extra patrols over there
---
&gt;**Action Boy/Girl:**  ... AP regen armor greatly diminishes the benefits  of this perk at about 2-3 pieces.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Sneak:**  Has no or very little effect when players have agility 30+. Probably working as intended. 
---
Why are either of these on a list of "broken" perks?  Both work off of diminishing returns and you can't "fix" either of them without giving people instantaneous full AP regen (I use Action Boy and have two AP regen pieces and already regain a full bar in about 3-4 seconds) or permanent unbreakable stealth.
---
Now you can’t tell what resources are available at workshops or who owns them. And fast travel isn’t free to owner workshops. Just bad.
---
Ign is newt341. We can try it out to see if the hits register.

It was nice for a new Fallout 1st outfit I just wish they had saved the Jason Voorhese outfit for Halloween, or to release on Friday the 13th.
---
Fair point.
---
Slow cookin makes the meat ohhhh so tender
---
Oh, I’m still holding out for that good submachine gun roll. I’ve got a stockpile of 10mm and 45, and all the mods I want unlocked for both. 
---
It’s starting to get to me though. I’m going to lose it if I get one more nocturnal drop.
---
27
---
But I've already done all the weekly challenges expect the NW one this week.
---
Deflection is such a beautiful mental defense isnt it?
---
So funny!!
---
Step warc what are you doing.
---
I think this is at the bottom of their list of concerns lol
---
I accidentally killed him i think. I killed the doctor
---
The last thing this game needs is more bugs.  The SECOND last thing this game needs is more damn NPCs vomiting out stupid voice lines/songs any time you get near them.
---
Aubrie or the raider?!
---
Thanks man. Also for your idea. I maybe gonna do another one on a mule alt with more vendors. For this char i only needed one vendor, but it rly could work as a mobile trading outpost/store with more of them upstairs.
---
What is it with this sub and only requesting new items for the Atom Shop? The BASE GAME needs more content not the damn atom shop. No one should be paying 4 bucks for a "Beeswax Hairstyle #3" with 17 polygons
---
don't forget about food! my melee damage doubles after all my food buffs
---
At the start screen before you enter NW theres an option at the bottom of screen to toggle "Fill Team" to off. If you do that you go in solo, otherwise it puts you in a team
---
If aubrie is a doctor then i killed him. I didnt interact with the raiders besides the wayward missions
---
Same

---
Those weren't raiders those were free radicals
---
The knifes are helping a lot
---
Guess I got the corona pink slip🤦‍♂️
---
Oh yeah no doubt, &amp; there are obviously so many other things that I’d personally hope they address before this, but it’s just that it’s soooooo time confusing &amp; I think to myself ‘why can’t we just bulk cook’?! But no, it’s waaaaay down the list I know, just on my wish list is all 😂
---
Raders and radicals have rads in them so i dont see a difference
---
27 boiiiiiiiiiii
---
True 👍 Problem is it’s so time consuming &amp; frustrating 🙄😂
---
Wrong Reddit page but to answer your question they come with codes and the DLC in NOT pre loaded on the Disc.
---
Would be easy money for them, since there are hairstyles and face paint from 4 or that other NPCs are already using, that we can’t...
---
It should be! Yesterday was the one day nobody actually bought anything though and I couldn't find any plans I didn't own so I gave up and bought a shotgun shell for 1 cap just to see if it counted.
---
Add Tenderizer too (broken now I hear)
---
Dear Canada guy,
---
You're*
---
"oh no....oh no..."
---
OH YES.
---
Just wait till you learn about ghouls
---
Last night it gave the sound and alert but failed to double my gauss shotgun rolls
---
What foods?
---
Are you talking about the 10mm smg? If you are then you must be doing something wrong because a bffr is a *beast*, even without a silencer. Same with the 45 smg, which HAS a silencer bit super short range as a drawback.
---
It certainly open up new possibilities for "getting head."
---
hey guys DAE fallout bad trolololololol
---
Oh, I can agree with that
---
Edit: thought he was being a snob for a reason

I’m talking about the .45 which does about 170 per shot
---
OH MAN! Did you write that yourself? cos that right there id comedy GOLD! Gold i tell you. In fact i'm gonna ring my mother now and tell her this joke. She'll probably wee herself from laughing
---
I saw mort. Guys pretty rad
---
I’m not looking for god strength. But I’m hoping to one-shot all humanoid enemies.
---
Lol, I did the same thing. I went to like 5 vendors and they were all selling either legendaries for several thousand caps regardless of what it was, or plans and other stuff at default value.. so i just bought one ammo.. lol.
---
Got tired of spending caps.
---
I see what you did there
---
The grafton monster at the Grafton Day event. It usually triggers when you enter Grafton. Theres another over at Hemlock Holes and theres usually a third stomping around under the rail bridge that goes over the dried river between Charleston and the Trainstation
---
I've got a B2515fr I can assure you it's NOT useless, not at all. It shreds the SBQ. It might not have the highest numbers but the fire rate more than makes up for it.
---
It does have a huge drawback however, and that is the really short range.
---
there is a door on the side facing the train station
---
Its okay, theyre not NPCs, theyre just moving models, they don't speak either.
---
Have you jet packed your way to the top and placed it in the center area as close to the junk pile as you can?  I am fairly certain this used to be possible and likely still is.  
---
Source:  have lived here for a year and rebuilt 3 times.
---
I do too
---
Oh boi lol yeah i fought this war too. Before, i had the "Tent V2" on both sides which ended in a total scripture chaos when replacing it. Had to delete it on one side and also attach the "V2" to the mounted deer head above it. Single words on surfaces dont mix the letters and seem to be fine. But if you have 2 separate words on the same surface, they go fuckin wild lol
---
It's not his welcome, its yours
---
Not even the Fasnacht collectron does that, lol.  He does give lots of booze and royal jelly for taffy though, which is pretty good.
---
I can confirm it is in it as I have it currently up on my wall.
---
I down voted myself too, got salt? Lol 😁👍
---
Smol PP
---
Nope! Anything you need will have that symbol near it, you can toss anything else
---
So many bugs where score isn't credited at all, and everyone who's been effected by it whom I have talk to l say that the support team instantly locked their ticket and refused to help or acknowledge the problem at all!
---
Hhhm well for one handed which is pretty sub par a combat knife with the mod would still be your best bet as the class is pretty bad compared with unarmed and two handed
---
Mine does over 700 per shot from stealth and fires about 10 shots a second.
---
Concentrate on one play style. In the other FO games it's pretty easy to create a character that's good at everything and it's temping to play that way here when your choosing perks and assigning SPECIAL points. Decide early how you want to play and build your character accordingly otherwise your gonna spend a lot of time respecing your character later.
---
Pitch 'em. Itll help a little with lag too.
---
That is amazing.
---
Contact customer support, they won't care and will just lock the ticket, but we need a papertrail of People TRYING to contact them!
---
I just deploy 3 then leave. Best NW challenge for people who are blind as bat like me.
---
Sell the photos to Kyomi
---
Me too! I accidentally bought the flyboy bundle last week and I'm running low :(
---
There's no legit way to increase budget. Yet. 
---
Get rid of turrets
---
Your not getting anything im saying man. just because you got put in a vault doesnt mean your gonna be for saving the world. Even smart people kill others.
---
It will most frequently spawn in the far top room.  It may have something to do with whether people are looking at it's spawn point or not as FO76 always tries to spawn stuff "out of view."
---
I think that when the season "ends" it should stay active with the next season, and you can just choose which one you want your SCORE to go to. This way, those who are more casual players (or those plagued by glitches losing possible SCORE), can still work towards the rewards that they want, and those who have finished the season just moves right on to the next one. I think this will solve many people's concerns about needing to login everyday.
---
I haven't actually checked mine since I built them and filled them, I'll take a look.  
---
\*EDIT\* Nope all good here, pumpkins are all safe.
---
its the weekly atom shop circlejerk. they need their dopamine jolt. people are addicted lmao
---
Your experience is pretty wholesome. Mine was getting gangbanged by two level 2s over and over again lol.
---
Me. I just discovered the seedy shed yesterday and also rebuilt my base. Since I missed out on the seedy shed that train car looks really nice.... I've totally thought about how on steam i can buy the 40 dollar atom bundle and get 5 dollars off.....the only thing holding me back is I just built my base and I like it
---
Thank you, def gonna be getting this when i get home
---
Bruh Its a caboose !
---
You can’t to my knowledge
---
The worst part is [they already have front irons modeled](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gv6r7p/several_weapons_are_still_missing_some_mods_one/) for the 10mm SMG but for whatever reason they are unobtainable.
---
Also where the hell is my suppressor for my 10mm SMG?
---
I've been finding him in the little trailer across from the power armor stations. Once he was floating above the boardwalk near sunny. I never know where he'll be.
---
Gotta know what the vending station does.
---
You can get a freezer,you can get nuka cola machine or red rocker cooler and it slows the decay of food
---
I grinded the gold bullion items, I'm done grinding for anything else. I can't log on daily for a few hours anymore, my girlfriend is gonna kill me if I keep it up. I'm basically done playing until actual endgame content comes out.
---
Neat!
---
The whole bundle's cool! Sucks that I spent Sunday fixing up a new base, have to take it all down and start over now. That train car won't even fit in my current build zone cause I goofed up on the CAMP placement
---
Did they lock your ticket after that automated response?
---
Actually lovers embrace will last you 3 hours instead of 2
---
Take a very close look at the picture from the atomic shop. It does not have skeleton gloves. Just zoom in and you can see it doesn’t.
---
Is the car just decorative or can you set up things like workbenches or tables inside?
---
It shouldn't be, just explain it to them and give them as much info as possible, I've found them to be extremely accomodating.
---
Why do they call if ovaltine? The bottle is round, the cap is round, they should call it round-tine!
---
Thanks very much. Just for the few ppl seeing this and maybe getting an idea out of it, the hassle making it was worth it =)
---
I try to run this once a day anyway as glowing meat steaks are good for caps, legendaries good for scrip, miners good for shotgun shells, steel scrap from weapons and lead from tin cans.  People normally one-shot the trash, but it's very rare you get people being dicks about the legendaries.
---
I've done this, I still spawn in inside a cliff face, I've given up and started building in there!
---
Omg that is the entrance I always take and I never thought about that.
---
Just let them keep the stuff but suspend them for 11 weeks so they can't show off that they have it early anymore until everyone else has it. Lol.
---
I had the workshop one give me score after my third work shop. I had to switch server. I decided to finish the other two and I got the score points again.
---
How long has it been since you played?? Lol. They changed the layout about a year ago. There is now one entrance. Walk around, you’ll find it.
---
Or you know make score easier to gain so no one would need to exploit your broken game.
---
What made you think we didn't know that?
---
Had to look it up lol. Didn’t know that word existed haha. Thanks tho
---
I like learning random little tidbits, thank you
---
I actually thought about placing a Vaulttec tent on top of the platform. But it didn't work out.
---
The first one is for T-45, it's a seperate skin unlock for each suit. Nuclear Winter is only T-51 or universal skins!
---
Well to be fair, it's on bethesda for not fixing bugs and exploits quick.
---
If you glitch your way to 100 then what are you gonna do for the rest of the summer anyway.
---
It's not like we have a lot of content to go through.  
---
Also is it worth it risking a ban at your account for doing it, someone that glitch his way to 100 is definitely doing an exploit at this point so they will get banned sooner or later.  
---
On the other hand dupers keep duping without any punishment so....
---
since adrenaline isn't working you could swap it out with sneak perks
---
Lmao. I assume all the people whining aren’t American but I love the fact a Canadian posted this. 
---
I love train car diners. I don’t know what it is but they seem to have some of the best breakfasts around.
---
7 days into the 3-month-long season and people are already asking to write it off and give everybody the rewards. This sub leaves me speechless sometimes 🤡🤡
---
We’re talking about regular armor, not power armor.
---
It's certainly better than that paint job from last month lol
---
If I didn't have Fallout 1st already, I'd sub for the outfit and atoms
---
I sell fasnacht donuts and royal jelly taffy and lots and lots of cans of dog food
---
Yeah, I know. I don’t plan on actually winning so I just don’t really care how obvious I am.
---
Negative. 94 was open once upon a time for raids. ::sigh:::
---
Maybe one day they will open again
---
Miss read what you said, thought you meant the atomic skin from the Legendary Run, not the fallout 1st skin.
---
No. It’s the same buff
---
Maybe, maybe not I just don't think PvP belongs in Fallout
---
You are a *god*. Tysm!
---
Yikes! I only have two out.   
---
Thanks for answering.
---
Yes!! And for some reason that horrendous paint was auto picked for my NW armor... So the next round I played, died almost immediately bc of the bright ass colors!! Lol
---
Happens to the best of us.
---
You are probably fun at parties
---
The serum or the recipe? Players will sell that serum for less than 500 caps.
---
I would say come to my vendor but I think someone wiped me out recently
---
All hail SteveStatic
---
Don't kid yourself, they didn't ban people who duped a hundred bloodied explosive fixers and they didn't ban people who are still running around with nuke miniguns and beam splitter handmades. Not a single person is gonna be punished for the score exploit and we all know it. That's why they are abusing it, because they know they are 100% safe. That's why people post videos on it, because they can show all their account info in cheating tutorials and still won't get banned
---
They've got black skin
---
Ahhh, a fellow enlightened /r/VXJunkies head!
---
That’s actually very reassuring. I’ve been hoping for a solid drop, but I’ve started wondering if it’s worth it. 
---
But with that clip size and fire rate, it could practically be a minigun in a stylish package. I do things sneaky-like, so I’m not too worried about the shorter range.
---
I've never felt so bad when I one shorted the legendary while doing that event with only one other level 30 person. I gave them the legendary after the event. Also, I've been to that event where people only tag them then have everyone come over so just depends. I stay away from it unless I'm on my own private server.
---
Oh heck no. Not everyone would be happy with that. I know I wouldn’t.
---
I've seen Rocksy on the roofs of a few different buildings.
---
Man, it pissed me off whenever I saw team mates running around with that paint job activated lol It just puts a spotlight on you! Unless my team's in Power Armor, I flat out ignore Scout Armor if I see that 1st logo next to it. You won't last long with that paint job at all, might as well run straight into the storm!
---
Meant I felt so bad damn the alcohol haha
---
I like to sell the Note from the President for 1776. Typically sells
---
I nuked Harper's Ferry, and got some hate, but I got a ton of flux also...
---
I honestly haven't logged in that far to check, been busy with the dog all day lol. I'll post an update in an hour or so when hubby finishes watching TV, but I'm assuming it is like the log cabin and seedy shed.
---
Aw, I zoomed in before and figured those were gloves. I guess it’s put on a black mannequin? Kind of misleading because that’s not normally how they present their apparel and would seem like a no-brainer to include. 
---
Oh, well. A little disappointing and a few dings on cool points from me, but you can’t beat free!
---
Looks like I’ll go two handed and use a machete for mobs
---
1 month later and people are still dealing with this bug. Of all the damn bugs, you'd think they'd make sure the MAIN DAMN QUESTLINE wasn't broken.
---
I'm with ya in this bought it on release and yes it had it's flaws but personally it wasn't the worst game ever wasn't great and yeah they have done some silly things with the fallout first while bad reviews but hey what game doesn't have a battlepass now so you can't blame them really! If anyone ever complains about any if that stuff blame fartnite. I got over the game when it released within a month or so but that also been my fault playing it like 12 hours a day at first haha but I've come back and I gotta say I'm loving where it's at! I love games where you set yourself a directive but end up been like 'oh wait what's this over here' hour later realising you haven't even started what you set out to do. They have improved the game heaps! Glad to see I'm not the only newish player not ragging it to follow the trend and actually enjoying it for what is!
---
I honestly believe the reason the budget is the way it is, is because of engine limitations. It's pretty old, and been overhauled many times. A Dev doc on the making of FO76, one of the devs even joked about finding Morrowind code still in there.
---
Possibly a good alternative
---
Mayb the rocksy glitch still works
---
I was in a round last night where everyone was calling the legendary mobs out and we took turns punching them.
---
As a bloody build I literally cant do anything but punch them without one-hitting them so if one person isnt playing nice it become a cluster-fuck to see who can hit them first.
---
It’s just Bethesda trying to force a pumpkin meta. Don’t let them get to you.
---
Thanks  it's not as if you can accidentally scrap that
---
I just want a mullet hairstyle
---
You can't, not for the holiday challenges, they're hidden.
---
I may have been wrong when I said that earlier. I need to check again but there may actually only be 7 weeklies + the repeatable one. Same as last week.
---
Accept less but get more? What?
---
Upvote for visibility.
---
Why does it need to be either or? Why can’t we get both?
---
Yep, and now you'll never be able to unsee (un-think?) it.
---
If the Scrip grinder only has 38 Scrip left, but you have a 40 Scrip weapon, let the user eat the 2 Scrip loss just to be able to dump it.
---
Yeah, google image search something like train diner, 50s train diner, etc, you’ll get a lot of examples and maybe some camp ideas! :) I wish they weren’t bundled, myself, and would love to see more worn train cars like we had in Fallout4, but I get where they were going with it.
---
It depends how far through the game you are.
---
If you're below level 30-40, I'd recommend to keep on playing the game as if you were playing a single player RPG - keep following the quests that the game has for you. The game is pretty good at breadcrumbing you to new quests and eventually you'll get round the whole map and story. Start thinking about what weapons you want to specialise towards and pick up perks to support that playstyle or any other perks you need at the moment. If there's events that you see that you feel confident doing then give them a go - there's usually high-level players there that can give you a hand.
---
Past that you probably want to really hone in on a specific set of weapons to use and start looking for the better legendary effects on those weapons. When you complete the main and Wastelanders quest lines, you can start attending events with more frequency or farming certain areas for specific gains.
---
Try and keep an eye out for your daily and weekly challenges. Normally they're not too difficult and you might complete a few without even trying, and you can get some helpful in game rewards and a few cosmetics from it. 
---
Sorry this is a bit vague - it's a bit difficult to give more specific advice without some more details. I'd be happy to help out more if you'd want more advice.
---
Sounds about right, im trying to avoid bloodied builds as they may be meta but that look extremely boring to play, never saw the point of having a pissing contest to see who can kill what the fastest
---
I should have said “to get some script” not more, but you get the idea.
---
I had people show up and buy my whole inventory, I was maxed out immediately because they bought all the weapons I had in there. Like why?? 
---
Bethesda really ought to have an automatic shutoff when we hit max
---
Or spend the next 800 hours of gameplay trying to rationalize it
---
For some reason the capture 5 workshops challenge popped up an hour before reset, I successfully completed it and got the 1000 SCORE reward, then after the reset I had the weekly again and can still complete it, I am yet to see if I will receive SCORE for it though.
---
Maybe workbenches were supposed to be powered and this is its variation and the others are somewhere scattered around the bottom of the map?????
---
Yep I'm definitely getting the package now.
---
Yea I just want to be able to build higher up inside of it. Where I have my Camp place now I can only build one floor up there. There is a place I can place it inside the pylon but then I would not be able to access the junk pile.
---
Ok Thank you. Sorry but im new to reddit i don't know half of this stuff.
---
The order isn't even always the same. The first time I had to do it the item was at the bottom of the list. The 2nd time it was in the middle.
---
The people OP is referring to are god mode glitching xp, they take any shortcuts they can. it wouldn't matter if there were only 15 ranks, they'd be doing it anyway.
---
Wait that’s rare? I think I saw one in the mountain of clothes in my inventory
---
Edit: Damn, it was one of the other various tattered items
---
Pump action shotgun ---- Pumpkin. Probably a slip of the keyboard or controller.
---
Great example! Yeah man, it's stuff like this that really makes you wonder about these developers cognitive abilities. They're the worst problem solvers in gaming and that's a title they're apparently proud of? I don't get it. Someone should drive down to Austin and flick each and every one of these devs in the ear.
---
You think one of these could trade for a responders fire fighter set? Or if the values are similar?
---
Oh goddamnit, the first time I've ever been tempted to actually buy Atom.
---
I did it on the flyboy outfit just the other day. Submit a ticket. The form is set up for refunds of real money so when it asks for a payment method just put n/a or whatever. I got my refund promptly
---
Hows the train car? Can you add walls or decorate the floors with the checkered floor skin?
---
