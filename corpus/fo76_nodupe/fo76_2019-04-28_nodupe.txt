Looks like batman on an edge of a building. Even better its a vengeful mothman
---
Yes.
---

---
I wouldn't say is a common occurence for me but I have experienced this before.
---
Is a shame because I don't seem to be able to be the 'last man standing' on the server anymore. Now it just shuts down for maintenance instead.
---
I miss being able to take all three power plants for heaps of 100% charge FCs without having to constantly look over my shoulder for parties of opportunistic cnuts that like to exploit the workshop PvP mechanic to ambush you wherever you are on the map
---
No unfortunately. You can use knives and two handed melee weapons though
---
If you‚Äôre looking for steel, it‚Äôs the Blackwater Mine, just whack a bunch of mole miners, take all their weapons and equip Scrapper perk, you‚Äôll have too much steel in your stash.
---
word wtf
---
It is because RDR2 isn't sold in the same places as FO76, such as how australia forced fallout to change the names of the chems from the street drug names to the fictional names in the game.
---
Darn. Alright. Would a ripper be a good melee weapon to use as a backup to a laser rifle in your opinion then?
---
A way for you, farm around mutant locations, loot and scrap their weapons. Also, don't forget to use Scrapper(Intelligence Perk Card).
---
By how friendly you seem looks like you may have deserves it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This is Mothman 
---
[Mothman ](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/92jPykVhmH2EA8XL7SNUEi.jpg)
---
PSA if you find an actual mothman (that's not friendly just like in the light house) you **NEED** to take the picture **BEFORE** killing the mothman. If you killed the mothman first, they'll turn into dust and that dust doesn't count as mothman.
---
Lol YES! I can feel your anger. Let it flow through
---
There is an ore vein near freds barbecue shack that gives straight steel with an extractor. I have my camp built on top of it. Just north of freds on the east side of the road! Good luck!
---
Diluted radaway, and careful use of diluted stimpacks. If you "over heal" you get down to your high DPS state again quickly, due to the constant rads. 
---
And just...don't go into the zone with junk you love, store it. You'll die, it happens.
---
I ran across him in the mire just randomly walking around. Dropped some horns and other components I assume are used to craft that imposter head they're selling in the cash shop.
---
If players didn't kill you they shouldn't be able to steal your junk total BS. Also I block everyone when I am farming at whitespring, so they can't see my location if I die or see me not he map to follow me to steal my kills, just do a session  block.
---
Can be marginally useful during Encryptid.
---
Nope. Your giant bulky power armor arms prevent you from wearing those weapons. The unarmed punch on a power armor is pretty good though, there's even some mod to make it stronger
---
This is my current method at West tek and national radio array. Was hoping there was a mine with alot of iron veins in it, kind of like lucky hole is with lead
---
What are you on about?
---
Im sure RDR2 has sold in the same countries as Fallout 76. It really wouldn't be too hard for Rockstar to edit out smoking in certain countries where it wouldn't be allowed.
---
Plus you don't see RDR2 calling there cigs Marlboro do you, so whats your point about JET etc?
---
Are you t
---
I'll check this one out, thank you
---
np and have fun!
---
you mean atoms ? atoms challenge are account wide, not character bound. People would farm them 24/7 if it was the case
---
I mean, bethesda shouldn't _give_ him items. Bethesda _should_ make it so you can flag shit you don't want to scrap.
---
Probably because in Fallout 76 the Cigarettes are made of Asbestos!
---
Can you get banned for moding?
---
Yeah I have my camp on a steel vein. Takes a while to build up tho.
---
Yeah I wore that for ages until I got the Cultist outfit, really good outfit
---
Same, finished and got all the good stuff.
---
well a game mode would work like aventure, survival, and market place, where its a large map that centralized as a market bazaar for player to trade goods like in fo1 I think the hub might be fo2 lol
---
but a server that can hold say 300 people or less but more then 30 lol
---
will work better well in my opinion
---
I doubt it, their FAQ just states they don't support mods as they may cause the game to crash. But the game crashes enough on its own anyways.
---
Rippers are pretty bad imho
---
[removed]
---
No I hit the prime fissue site, without checking player numbers again, with all that going against 2 or 3 players that wasn't fun at all.
---
The diseased legendary one i killed was just free roaming by a fissure in the bog area. Careful i had to deal with a scorchbeast right after lol
---
Laser weapons and the ripper are way behind in damage compared to most other weapons. You're better off getting anything else. Is your build specialized on two handed or 1 handed?
---
I saw a video in YouTube by a fella called Juicehead where he is using  a deathclaw gauntlet in PA but don't know how he dind it. He should not be able to do that.
---
The point is, FO76 can't edit them out because it is bethesda. They can't even release a patch without fucking something up. So you expect them to be able to edit out a usable item in one area and not have it show up in another?
---
Ya. Kinda set it and forget it.  Maybe taking a bunch of workshops at once? Grafton steel?
---
Alright thanks! I will be checking out some mods
---
I saw that, and it made me wonder.
---
You get the mods from doing the event again. The mods I‚Äôve seen for the club include burning, burning barbed, electric, poisoned, and heavy. There may be more, I‚Äôm not sure. On PS4, I have heavy and burning barbed and can craft them for your club if you want.
---
dont hurt the baby deathclaws
---
Also sometimes the robots have already buried the bones, under the cupboard!
---
Nice one, cheers
---
You can kind of create your own using the rug glitch to place crops on tables then put a planter underneath them and they will look like that kind of.
---
*slow down and pay attention* If you accidentally throw your phone away, apple isn't replacing that shit.
---
No nearby stashbox!
---
Ok you got me there
---
Again. Completely different. Pink Panther is a childs cartoon. Dont know the anime, but seeing as its an anime I assume it is also targeted to youth. Once again, FO76 and RDR2 are rated M for mature. Which means you must be an adult. Bottom line is if RDR2 had tabacco products then this law does not restrict them from having tobacco products, which means it doesn't restrict FO76 from using tobacco products. Not to mention that the tabacco products are ALREADY in the game. Making them consumable wouldnt be any different. Its not like theyd ad an extra animation for it, even though in RDR2 you can sit there and smoke a cigarette for a while.
---
No, you can put a keypad power pylon on the side without a keypad, a switch, or use a terminal, but it won‚Äôt close by itself unless it‚Äôs the keypad power pylon
---
This is such a shit comparison. "Oh, you clicked a button twice instead of once. That's EXACTLY LIKE throwing a physical object"
---
Damn Jake, that's vicious...
---
It's a common phenomenom called "bystander effect".
---
I usually do light if it is inside and dark for any outside foundations
---
Thanks anyway but I'm on Xbox I don't mind doing the event but are the clubs by chance in the legendary loot pool?
---
‚ÄúJust waiting for some pesky vault dweller to come by, I‚Äôll probably just jump out with some ghouls, do my loud scream and get one hitted. Same shit different day‚Äù
---
Lupin isn't a kids show, it is literally about a thief that steals shit and hooks up with women, it is from the 70's. Think James bond as a burglar.
---
When I need lead from a silo I turn it on just to not be bothered.
---
That would be a bad influence on young people.
---
Probably good to use against mr gusties. If your in a situation where stopping them is lifesaving.
---
What exactly is it?
---
Perk card/point? Or rewards from challenges?
---
I don‚Äôt think so, but I‚Äôm no expert on that. I‚Äôve only seen the plans for the club and staff drop, not the weapons themselves. So I doubt there are legendary variants. The mods alter the looks of the weapons greatly though. My favorite is the poison one which I‚Äôve never seen anyone talk about. It makes the skull look bloody and has bugs crawling all over it constantly.
---
Just looked up the show "Lupin III" is considered a "Seinen Manga" Seinen literally translates to youth.
---
I can‚Äôt get it to open from the non-keypad side.
---
The  bodies disappearing is worse than ever, it's really bad.
---
No way to get them to follow me around like in Fallout 4? Can they be sent to my camp like a pet?
---
Alright, I‚Äôm gonna go with the light one, just wondering with the light one, can it be placed on both wooden and concrete foundations?
---
Bloodied, 90% reduced weight and +1 agility
---
Well, I‚Äôm actually basing it off of a statue I have. It‚Äôs a person in T60 holding a laser rifle. I thought it‚Äôd be cool to make a build based on that. I just figured I‚Äôd need a backup to a rifle.
---
Nope not to my knowledge. It‚Äôs just a hard ahutdown on them and soft on event bosses.
---
Yeah it can
---
You might want to do more research:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin_the_Third#Production
---
directly from the description:
---
As the series was to be **published in a magazine targeted at adults**, Fujiko Mine was created to add a female presence and to fulfill a "Bond girl" role. Her name was inspired by a picture of Mount Fuji, Monkey Punch added the -ko female suffix to create her first name,
---
Lvl? Combat shotgun? Pump shotgun? Double barrel?
---
Agreed
---
The power line has to snap to the center of the door, instead of the keypad on the inside, if you just run a standard line to the center it will keep it open until removed, but with the keypad power pylon it won‚Äôt send power down the line until you punch in the code
---
How'd you get to show military time?
---
I've actually never had either of those events fail, because if I show up and other people don't know that mechanic...they can be taught? And frankly generally speaking, that aspect is a solo-able thing? I've taken all three conduits how many times now... you could try doing THAT instead of this?
---
Turns out, the problem here is you.
---
...okay open up that link, and look at their demographic for me. Seinen. Youth.
---
By how condescending you are i wonder if you might be the shithead that took my stuff
---
Not that I know of but I've never really used heavy guns so scrapped a lot and picked it up at some point.
---
So that‚Äôs what the fuck goes on over there. As I was nearing the main resort building for the first time I was jumped by a bunch of diseased bloated glowing ones, one legendary. I left but when I came back, this shit happened again, third time was the same. No wonder there‚Äôs always people there
---
You don't know what that means do you? LOL

---
 The light is great with the brick walls inside textures. Well I think so anyway. ;)
---
I will take it add xJB_virus really really sorry for late reply
---
Okay. Ill take it. I didnt read all the way through to that last bit. Though I dont know why you are using a Magna from the 70's to try to prove a point when a game from 6 months ago made in the U.S. based in the U.S. has tobacco products in it.
---
This is yet another in a long list of broken daily/weekly achievements.
---
They give away free stuff about every week.
---
Level 50, Pump.
---
But, yes, that would work too.
---
Because it was re-released in america and had the ciggs removed because of that law. It was shown on ADULT swim at 3am and they still had to remove the tobacco use.
---
Lol
---
Are you a regular potato, or a sweet potato?
---
 Appreciate the help but this makes no sense to me. Why the fuck wouldn‚Äôt that just have an inside switch who the hell wants a one-way door?  We really gotta fucking ‚Äúhack‚Äù the door make this shot work?  Fuckin hell Bethesda.
---
Well, that would make sense, if you knew in advance who the idiot griefers were.
---
Weapons workbench if it's a weapon. Then find the weapon for the mod you're trying to equip. Since you own the mod, it won't take the materials, and you don't have to have known the plan.
---
With all the chems my character is defendant on to "survive" I dont see how my character smokin is gonna hurt me any worse lol. Jus reduce AP for havin bad lungs for awhile
---
You know you're still working as a conduit while you're down but not dead, right? You can hold that thing for five-ten seconds a shot solo, easy.
---
Its a cryptic challenge. ;)
---
Ohhh. Does it need to be in my inventory since they take up space. Can I have it In My stash?
---
I haven‚Äôt had that problem myself, but when I do get a three star drop it‚Äôs pretty much the same one every time. Not even something I can use with my build.
---
Smokeable's coming to the Atom Shop near you! I read through some of those duders about the law and what not in this thread, L O L. no law detains to cigarettes in games for actual use, its just straight up developers not wanting flak from all of "Those" people out there.  That's straight up all it is. "Those" people.
---
 I can get Rippers to 37 a tick. Its impressive. ;)
---
Your guess is as good as mine, it‚Äôs a pretty lazy choice, I mean just look at the brick keypad door, the keypad is on the wrong fucking side lol
---
If drop an item with a paint job, it destroys it entirely. It isn't available for people who have the paint job. It's just a guess, but I think paint jobs are tracked to personal ownership.
---
Until someone cannibalizes you, which is a real thing...
---
If it's a power armor mod it still does a pop up like you need materials, but just just press apply anyway because the mod is the materials.
---
op sure did need that junk  
---
how much could you have possibly had, for real  
---
it's kinda on you for having a bunch of junk in a nuke zone
---
Nope I was all 3 conduits and still fought the sheep squatch and lived through the whole thing
---
It can be in your stash.  
---
I should clarify that it acts like you'd still need the materials, but when you consume the mod, no materials will be used.
---
I GET THAT. If you can smoke tobacco in RDR2 in the U.S. you can smoke tobacco in FO76 in the U.S. bottom line. RDR2, and FO76 are both M rated videogames. So they would both have to follow all the same laws dontcha think? So that means it is not because of this law you keep referencing that FO76 doesnt let you smoke cigarettes.

Just leave it on overnight with you in sneak mode and have the controller movement pressed forward into a wall. This will let you get an extra 5mins in when you go to bed before the server fails.
---
I‚Äôve got one if you still want it
---
It shouldn't. 
---
But I noticed in my trade menu that it does. It also in a backhanded way protects you against accidentally droppng something that's equipped.
---
Yup, I get almost double xp when wearing my full unyielding set.
---
The fastest I've personally seen her killed was under 2 minutes.... No idea how many players were involved though. :/
---
Awesome thanks I‚Äôll take a look. I‚Äôll have to look at all my mods, are they in a separate area or anything? Or just looped in with everything
---
I'll take it, psn epicduck00
---
Sounds like you were in a place above your lvl
---
Hearing this kind of thing alot recently, people must be getting bored again and can't hack it in survival mode. Unless he was building in a spot with a random encounter or something else that directly bothers others players.
---
I've changed it back. I hope it "just works" now lol
---
Thank you :)
---
Then you reached the 1 percent of quality players this game does have. Congrats, you should get a lottery ticket.
---
This is incorrect. I saw someone get one-shotted this morning in adventure mode. 
---
A player tied unsuccessfully to attack me, then attacked and killed the player next to me, who was just standing there, not doing anything.
---
I know that server hoping one location is the consensus, but I hoped for 3 hours not finding it while shifting between 3 locations. So I decided to fast travel around to each spot on one server and found it immediatly.
---
I joined an encryptid event earlier today knowing full well there weren‚Äôt enough people to win, so I mainly focused on marsupial hopping and tagging enemies with a tse shotgun and gained a whole level from the exp weekend boost
---
Mothman asks itself this very question.
---
Uranium Fever, Free Range, Horde events. All work great
---
Ok, thank you
---
Already changed it to standard Name. Thx!
---
Fingers crossed
---
I've never had that problem.  Maybe the console player base is even more toxic than PC. 
---
See, if you _know_ this shit, why are you _bitching_ about people who don't hear, instead of just _doing the damn job yourself_ in the game? 
---
Killing a few dogs or bloatflies isn't hard. Getting a crit into the sheepsquatch before running around hitting pylons isn't hard. 
---
Expecting everyone else to do that work instead of you is just stupid.
---
You're not thinking like a griefer.
---
The leader and Nuke Launcher was WarKryme, Him and his team were awesome. He said they have 450 SBQ kills.
---
This was written they did not have hunting rifles in the legendary pool. They were added like 3 patches ago. They also made it so energy weapons can not have the explosive legendary affect. But there are explosive legendaries from before that patch out there.   
---
You will find because this is a live service game, a lot of these older guides are somewhat out of date.
---
The light is too clean for me, everything is dirty or has holes, so I went with dark lol.
---
 The Burrows drops a lot of Legendaries even when not nuked.
---
Why not both?

---
I'd rather have no 10 seconds of my screen freezing every time I load in to a world before a QOL upgrade like this.
---
... Everything I've read literally everywhere else but here (and my personal experience) says this is not true for 76.
---
It just works
---
Added you
---
There are other countries with laws even more strict than what is in america, if RDR2 gets away with it good for them. Doesn't change the fact that they may be not selling the game in all the same countries as FO76.
---
West Tek is ok as well. I don‚Äôt farm there because there‚Äôs too much traffic however.
---
I guess timing is [everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh3r9c/bucket_list_quest_ansel/)
---
What weapons are meta against SBQ?
---
Good to know! Lol we just got caught off guard, and luckily it got stuck in some trees so he just pot shot it until it died. Then two high level scorch beasts showed up, all with in minutes of logging in... Which in our experience was unusual... So I thought there was a possibility of something weird going on.

Thx guys blackwater mine was great
---
I agree with the caveat the game should give you most content without requiring server hopping, I'm a casual and don't have that much time to play (so I don't hop and spend it all in loading screens) but I would like to experience the same game everyone else is.
---
I have seen posts complaining before and thought people were being dramatic or something but this weekend I've been playing more than normal to level a pvp sniper and noticed it is really bad. When I finally catch a 3 star legendary and it disappears or whatever it feels so lame!
---
By how you're acting I hope it happens to you again
---
Maybe, maybe not. Gear matters alot.
---
I was using a tse combat shotgun when she landed and I could see her health move down. The others used heavy weapons, Gatling lasers and LMG‚Äôs. We also had a couple people in the weeds using bloodied stealth builds that are super powerful.
---
Good luck, strange things are happening. I crafted a XO-1 yesterday and it did not apply a standard paint, some yellow/blue/pink chit, I don't own any paint like that, strange.
---
Do you like being everyones bitch in every event? Because I know I don't. Taking all three pylons and going through 1000 stimpaks and also running around to desperately keep three low level Brahmins safe. Yes, I did say THREE. One isn't a issue, but three will be. I will do my part, but if you join the event you better do yours. I shouldn't have to solo, it is a teamwork effort. This "bitching" that you call it is teaching some poor potato out there that teamwork is really the key to success in this game. As for you, you clearly love the "Being taken advantage" type. I got some real estate to sell you...
---
It depends on your guns and armour , I‚Äôm level 90 and have been wrecked by level 40s
---
It's tough when you have to choose between a deathclaw and a sheepsquatch.
---
I killed a 3 star and saw a drill fall to the ground from it one time. The body had no loot and I picked a level 1 drill up off the ground. It just works.
---
I kind of agree with you.

I‚Äôd rather see certain things fixed or implemented before we move on to something this specific.

Oh my god. Okay we are just going to keep going in circles. I was just trying to find out if you knew this for a fact. I probably couldve already had a list of every country both games were released in during the time Ive wasted try to converse with you. Ill get the actual answers myself.
---
Yeah my cool roof designs have turned janky AF a few times because I didn't have those available.

It‚Äôs a sewer hole I think

You seem to be missing the fact I don't really care enough to do any more research than a quick cursory glance at the laws I've already shared that make it hard for games and shows to have tobacco use in them. RDR2 is a bit different than fallout76. Rockstar is a massive company that can handle a legal fight if it comes to it. Bethesda on the other hand, especially after the flop of fo76 and how it is just hemmoraging money. They are gonna be lucky to keep the servers going until the private server mods are released.
---
When tse were better we were like 12 people and we killed it in like 6 minutes.
---
It‚Äôs still below level 5
---
Great idea, with text chat from an app on your phone
---
Read the other post for the confirmed answer
---
In my experience it doesn't affect that negative aspect of speed demon.
---
Looks fantastic,! I thought chinisium was a real thing in FO76 for a second... I obviously don't wear T51 armor.
---
If you go to the BBQ shack in the Savage Divide it has a chance of starting. It also occurs in the Mire to the east or north of Tanagra. I can't remember where exactly.

Is this of a recent patch or has it always been in the game?
---
I had a dream there were kangaroo power armour, really scares you when you have no clue what you're doing.
---
You‚Äôll be fine it‚Äôs tied to your character
---
I went there, found little, later on found a chick with a weird veil, went back, and was incredibly shocked how I managed to miss this giant chunk of the location.
---
I have a primed bloody explosive gatling laser that, under the right conditions, will spit out well over 5k per second. It was a beast before they buffed it. Now it's a monster.
---
I'd say bloody furious or anti armor heavy weapons are the guns to bring to a queen fight.
---
I hold all 3 wothout dying all the time. 3 points in first aid easily outheals it. I've done that and held the impostor off, on my own, on a level 32 character. Simple matter of tactics.

Trust me, its clear you dont care about facts.

It has been my experience that this has always been the case. I'm not sure if it is intended or not.

 the part on the pipboy that looks like a mechanical dial below the screen, unless i am mistaken
---
Yeah... I got pretty tired of server hopping for the Hunter's Long Coat, it became tedious and not fun like, really quick. Started having to put on spotify or youtube in order to keep myself entertained while I did it.
---
People say they do a lot of things a lot of times. Doesn't mean it is true, unless it is on tape of course.
---
I know where there is 9-10 iron veins (probably another 4-5 not too far away), as well as 8 lead veins.
---
I don't want to divulge it yet, but I will let you know the second best place to get iron ore is right outside the Whitespring bunker main entrance. There are 3 on the side of winding road leading up to the bunker, then there's an additional 4-5 behind the dead guy in the chair on the rocks.
---
With Excavator PA on, I get anywhere from 70-110 iron ore from each run there.
---
Same thing happened to me and my friend. We were wearing variants of the Asylum worker outfit and it didn't work for either of us.

I dont think an app would work with fo76 engine thro
---
Yeah we used to he able to keep buffs too from foods etc. Are those being removed upon death?
---
It was just another way to become general in the enclave but they scrapped it maybe one day they will redo it to fit another quest
---
You have a nuke card?
---
Yea I found it, thanks man.
---
Yeah, hopefully. It would be nice for that negative effect to be included in the decrease negative effects perk lol.
---
I also have brick walls, and went with darkwood laminate. If you're on pc, you can come check it out yourself.
---
Thought the furnace was a giant bong lol.....stoner things
---
by any chance is there a link to the helmet listing? i wanna try doing something like this
---
That is great for you, doesn't change the fact that the repair kits are literally p2w, why do you think so many people who were playing survival switched back to adventure. They didn't want to try to compete with p2w kiddies with their parents credit card getting the advantage of not having to uncrouch to repair, thus never showing up on the map when they are on the leaderboard.
---
I'm a fan of the  darkwood  version it looks good with the wood, barn, and bricks walls.
---
Good job!
---
Don't let it hit you then. Pretty fucking obvious solution.
---
Just got my first in 76, after years of FO4 I had never received one.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 107 now and these days I play guardian angel to random low levels exploring high level parts of the map. Just hang back and pop off a few rounds occasionally to balance the fights. Not sure what I‚Äôll do after that gets old.

---
Really ? Are you on Xbox? I want to check that out for my self
---
Im in Charlie now.. I can launch by myself, but wanted to know if anyone wanted to tag along.
---
I would love to see your build. I appreciate the advice. My thinking now is though to get TSE one though because I play more with friends than I do solo, but I/E seems like the smarter choice all around. I just need to get a head of the group lol. I use B/E now but I really hate running low health. Makes me paranoid lol.
---
What is? This was a level 50... or am I missing your point?
---
Only ever seen it happen when someone doesn't let her regen properly the first time!
---
Not too many flat areas around, I would out near Flatwoods or Near the Overseers camp a little up or downstream. Probably near Flatwoods would be the most flat .. also depending on how you built your camp, you unlikely to be able to move it .. also maybe near morgantown near the highway, near Biv somewhere ..
---
Ive heard there's a new random encounter involving a friendly Sentry Bot that, if you use Robotics Expert on it, can be 'tamed' and sent to your CAMP
---
Point I got the card but it didn't give me my perk point.
---
On your side with this one. Required hopping takes the immersion out of the game. I know the events n such are supposed to feel natural with exploration, but when you've done what feels like everything, trying to find something specific to do (or find) gets pretty tedious.
---
Are you can be more truthful and post actual **realistic claims** and not dick ride the few other idiots in here who don't know what they are talking about.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm on Xbox. But I‚Äôd love to see pictures of your camp on r/fo76settlements
---
I feel really guilty because I got it at the first place I looked. The one time RNG was on my side in this game. I found it at the teapot.
---
You on PS4, what primes are you looking for?
---
I hope you're still there. I'm looking for that camera
---
Yes still here
---
I saw a screenshot of someone breaching it at one point- can't give you in a source, it was in a YouTube video I watched a while ago, maybe a Juicehead vid? Sorry- but there doesn't appear to actually be anything behind the door as of right now, just the catwalk extending into the void.
---
You can still get in there, but doing so glitches out the game till you close it down!
---
I absolutely agree. I have zero interest in pvp and have rarely claimed workshops since the change to contesting them happened. I used to love to use them as a sandbox for building ideas.
---
What about the alien imposter in the Van Lowe Taxidermy building in Lewisberg?
---
I agree. As far as I know we can still be attacked with the advanced warning of something unreadable flashing up on screen for a microsecond just before a player beats us to death with a hammer. I would take workshops and abandon them if it were a mechanic. They're good got free fast travel and not much else.
---
RDR2 is not available in Saudi Arabia, however FO76 is. Saudi Arabia has created strict Tobacco advertising laws because it is becoming a big problem over there. 10% of male deaths were caused by tobacco in 2014. In 2016 they passed strict tobacco laws to stop the epidemic. They ban all direct and indirect tobacco advertising. Here you go, an answer with facts to back them up, even though you don't care about those.
---
DO I!?
---
This
---
If they just put a stash box in the building to the right of the cemetary, I'd be happy.
---
Don't you mean the players friends who fast traveled to you right before their friend claimed it?
---
Did you select another special first by any chance.
---
I don't think so, and for some reason my friends still see me as level 23.
---
I think the fact as there were only 10 of us must have helped.
---
I'm hearing that one doesn't work for the challenge!
---
I don't care about smoking facts at all. They are pointless, shit needs wiped out globally.
---
I wish I would have taken more time with the main quest (read notes, terminals). I raced through during the beta because of time constraints. 
---
I guess my only tip is to take your time and enjoy the journey.
---
Also, never pass up springs and screws.
---
I place a pressure plate on the inside, that way it opens just long enough to go through the door!
---
My issue is, legitimately, I've never had this problem. I've shown up and early on I might be the only one on pylons. but that changes quickly. I've never been in a event where the Brahmin died. 
---
So either things are VERY different on console, you have VERY shit luck,  or you need to grow some thicker skin and realize you don't always luck out when it comes to servers full of random players.
---
There are speciality builds but overall it's lacking. It's cool in design but not execution, like the drill. My bloodied Mr Handy I'd capable of 351 per tick.
---
Odd
---
Back when bobbleheads stacked, I had a friend who took her down solo in- allegedly -one shot. He had a crap ton of explosive bobbleheads, some other bobbleheads, popped a chem, and killed her as soon as she popped out. I was not there for this, so I have no idea how true it is, nor do I have any video
---
Across the road from Whitesprings Station.
---
It‚Äôs Grand Central Station over there.
---
Around new gad has plenty of flat and relatively flat land inside and around the roads outside the dry lake respectively. There not so much foot traffic as there is other players who set up shop on this area.
---
Still coming?
---
My friend has everything in his weapons tab drop into a bag during free range, he had to frantically look for it!
---
Skyrim had it too I think?
---
1 star junkies pool cue from the Queen is a kick in the balls through!
---
Random, although there is an event to spawn in the Wise Mothman who is non-hostile
---
IMO, if you are not at a workshop you own you should not be PVP flagged unless you go to contest a workshop takeover. it should auto forfeit if you do not go fight for what is yours. PVP flags should also not apply to team members outside of the workshop's claim border.
---
Try an assaultron blade of some kind. It's kinda futuristic like the energy weapons. It'll be way better than the ripper. Maybe The Gutter variant would have a use for you, since it's going to be a back-up and that would heal you.
---
Dude, just gonna toss this out here, looking at your post here...if you think this rage-fest is "grounded"...
---
Yeah. Bought plans made like 20, no mods. But the weapon is great as is, it would be stellar with a hardened receiver or sight ring.
---
It worked for me. If you want to shot a try, don't hastitate to join me! I will wait a bit.
---
Keep it in your camp and eat the cap cost of travel
---
Some piece of chameleon armor and most of the mutations are required as most ppl stay hidden and invisible as often as possible. It's usually fast fighting with the victim having no response time. How you play makes a difference here so give it a try and see what you think
---
...based on your responses, and what you said in this post, sounds like you lowkey had it coming. Chill, dude, it's just a game. You can get all that stuff back. People are assholes, don't let them get to you like this
---
You don't have to live up to your username, y'know. Usernames aren't a way of life. =P
---
Event fails if you leave the area for too long!
---
Relog.  Bivs did that to me once.
---
Agree on the limited time offers, just keep them ffs!
---
Nvm you showed up I think haha
---
some people really enjoy the min/max aspects of the game, and that's cool...but if you want to role-play, want to organically take on challenges and not analyze each and every state, level and perk, that's cool too.
---
Play the game however you want. Don't rush.
---
At first the game can be a little, but not too grindy. Pick up as much junk as possible it will certainly help later game. The white springs, the giant white building near the center of the map, is a great place to level up using the golf club and is used as a player hub for trading and selling to robots and players in the resort. Follow the main quest line to gain access to all the important stuff and legendary enemies drop better loot with extra perks, unlike regular enemies. Invest in perks such as strong back, they help MASSIVELY with carrying things. Always have atleast 1 main, 1 sidearm, and 1 melee weapon at all times. Collect fusion cores to power your power armor. If you need any help then just ask the community and we're sure we'll have the answers you're looking for. Hope you enjoy the game fellow wastelander!
---
Welcome, have fun out there
---
Me and my buddies usually run 3 a day at least
---
you're a prick
---
This same post that I am echoing has been posted countless times on this reddit. It isn't a ME problem. Upvotes already are telling. You already said you don't mind soloing these events when other people are at the events. Congrats, "Yes man" but not everyone is going to do that. You stand for a very small percentage of players that are willing to do this. The Events are a teamwork effort. End of discussion.
---
Alas its only a 1* enemy, sometimes spawns with no legendary effect at all!
---
Thank you for this!  Now I only need buzz brain!

I gave it a shot today and it worked well for me.  I had woopsies long before I (slowly) beat the queen down from behind after crippling her legs.  Then I tried my best to lead my new fam of 6 hatchlings back to Watoga.  They didn't survive the trip.  I \*did\* learn that if you train a mirelurk king into Watoga, the bots won't be able to take him down though.  For some reason they kept running away after he hit them a few times.
---
Are you still there?
---
I'm down.
---
What upvotes? The main post shows zero upvotes, and every reply you've had is at 1 or 0.
---
The funny thing is, Condition effects weapon damage and armor DR, so if you are using repair kits vs someone who did Queen or just repaired 200% at bench you are underpowered, it's literally not P2W at all!
---
The precedent concern is valid, but that not what people are complaining about mostly.  If selling non p2w convenience items helps the game improve or the atom shop get more quality items I'm all for it.  
---
Instead people like yourself just want to be virtuous online over nothing.
---
Yes
---
Rng, it's ALL LUCK, you can kill 3* enemies constantly and never see a 3 star drop!
---
Omw now

PvP enables on lvl 5, before that you can't hurt other people and no one can hurt you

Make an offer, level 45. Does 170 for me, all riflemen and bloody mess

I need to raise the ADS sens without raising my regular sens, if I turn up the sensitivity in the settings I'll be out of control unless I'm ADSing. It's either too slow ADS and good non-ADS, or good ADS and too fast non-ADS

Also look at your actual comments. Even if there are a few people who agree with you, there are people who are actually talking who don't... and no one supporting you with actual words.

I have speed demon and it seems food and water seem to last longer with class freak, but it may be wishful thinking. I used perk cards that suppressed hunger and thirst before running class freak and didn't notice a huge jump in food/water consumption. I also run herbivore so maybe something helping with that mutation?
---
And you are useless to this discussion...
---
Welcome! I know the feeling haha
---
How do you find mutation serums and how much do they cost?
---
Dude bro died SO much. Seemed pretty pissed after the fight ended cause from the looks of things, everyone just let him die when he was downed. But he kept respawning and was able to finish with us lol
---
There‚Äôs a plan and a mod, what platform are you on?
---
Maybe their higher-level friend told them to come.
---
I cant possibly imagine they were usefull tho
---
TLDR, any and all factions can be started out of order. I completed the Enclave quests before finishing Raiders or even starting BoS. There *is* a flexible order the storyline goes in, but the fluidity between factions allow it to get out of order, if you choose.
---
If I'm recalling correctly, Responders (Flatwoods) leads to Fire Breathers (Charleston FD), leads to Raiders (Top of the World), leads to Free States (Abbie's Bunker), leads to BoS (Camp Venture/Fort Defiance), leads to Enclave (Whitesprings Bunker).
---
..like a little guy watching his daddy shave..kinda cute..
---
Dude just kept dying over and over, but he kept coming back and finished the fight with us. I gotta give him credit though, he didn't go off and hide! He stayed out there shooting and fighting everything!
---
I'm noticing (personally) a moment or two of inability to move, and I'll remain "stuck" until I slide left or right (basically the same thing).  
---
Documented and reported.
---
I'm so disappointed I missed the Bone Raider skin. Hope they bring it back.
---
Welcome to pleasant valley, huh?
---
Why not?
---
You join every faction by doing the main quest in order. Each time you finish one part of the main quest, the next ome will start.
---
If i recall, the order is:
---
-responders
---
-firebreathers (which are technically still responders)
---
-raiders
---
-free states
---
-brotherhood of steel
---
-enclave
---
Yes, the one guy who says he completed the imposter event as a level 32 without dying once while hitting all three pylons. Please tell me you didn't fall for those laughable claims... Those who support you don't usually need to pipe in to a discussion. There is nothing to debate if you agree with someone.
---
Odd. I ran into this problem with a new base location when trying to move my fusion generator to my roof. Your suggestion would have saved me an hour of problem solving
---
They actually gave us a few free games, but they were old ones that few people care about.
---
I support this though, because I sure as fuck deserve something for the crap I dealt with in the early days.
---
You can get lucky like me and find a kind player who will charge very minimal fees, or - Spoiler for if you haven't completed the game/ found all the factions- you can buy them in the enclave bunker science wing for a few thousand caps.( recommended max out hard bargain+ high charisma for this)  you can also buy the plans for double to triple the price.
---
I'm glad I could help

The "why" is more of a "OH MY GOD YOU'RE TOO SMALL FOR THIS WHY ARE YOU HERE GO SAVE YOURSELF" as opposed to "oh my GOD gtfo n00b"

Thanks no finally figured it out.  It‚Äôs a joke that we have to do this though.  Should just be a back side to the keypad that is a switch to open it for 5 seconds just like the keypad does.

Great build! Really nicely done.

Either you weren‚Äôt around during the early days or there‚Äôs something wrong with you.

Grafton steel produces more iron than you can use.  You can farm super mutants there too.

Lol yesssss

Imagine getting an quad, anti-armour, bloodied, explosive, Furious, vampire, handmade with vat crits and fire rate.... brooooo... that would be totally outrageous and OP man.... 
---
Huh huh... huh huh... ü§§ü§§
---
I save my point and unlock and max a perk every 5 levels or so jus so I can play with new stuff but get to the point with max benefit really.
---
Is pointless. 4 times the body disappeared and I'm sick of getting fedoras. Games broke
---
Xb1 
---
I have never ever seen a plan. What platform you on
---
Prob a good time for the alt characters to come out n power level lol
---
Anti armor, bloodied, furious, instagating and executioner.
---
Took 4 hours of server hopping for me!
---
I lost a Gatling and a leg and arm from my PA. The Gatling really hurt. This is absolutely unacceptable to have stuff vanish like that. I even had a dupe set of armor appear recently...  somehow. Other than flaky servers, I can't think of what could cause this.
---
I've been here since day 1 of both games, care to elaborate?
---
Same xb1, I thought I had an extra plan. I have the mods for it tho, you can get them at watago vendors but it might take some server hopping . And there has to be a plan lol I‚Äôm pretty sure modify it
---
It's harder to do, but they still work!
---
It's hard for me to understand why the Imposter Assaultron Head isn't a skin for the, you know, Assaultron Helmet.  Seems like that would be way more badass.
---
What legendary mods would maximize damage on a plasma rifle? It seems like itg would be two shot or furious
---
The
---
Directly SE of Sylvie and Sons Logging camp, there's a random encounter location. 
---
  
---
If you look in the Prima Guide bestiary for Zetans, there's a screenshot of one in game. It has 2 nuclear plant stacks in the back. I traced the screenshot down by matching the ridge lines and power plant, down to the two dead trees in the vague foreground down to the ridge line directly by this random encounter location.
---
The guide indicates that you get the Alien Blaster from it. This was obviously changed before launch with it being put in the safe. This makes me think that Zetans were a random encounter and removed. Perhaps that random encounter is being placed back in with the Sheepsquatch release?
---
Best assumption I can make with radio silence on the weekly being doable or not. I've server hopped at this location quite a bit. No aliens, but I have seen the Sheepsquatch random encounter go from its nest being visible and only hearing the roar it makes earlier this week, to the same nest but with it spawning. So there's obviously been added events this week.
---
There are many times that I server hopped where I thought it was a bit odd that nothing was spawning/triggering. This could just be the flat chance of nothing actually appearing, but a tiny doubtful hunch says this might be the Zetan event, but I lack certain triggers. Planning on trying to hop a few more times later tonight with an Alien Blaster in the inventory or something.
---
Really hope its possible/there's a secret that'll get found out before the weeklies end. If there is no mystery to it and its just bugged, that'd be pretty lame. As much as I understand occasional technical blunders, when things like this are goofed up, it makes the potential for adding secrets to follow in game a lot more difficult for players as there's always the chance that its half baked/not finished. Here's hoping.
---
There is only one mod to learn!
---
Reported, It does appear 8.5 was an older client.
---
Theres the skeleton mask at the pumpkin house and the outfit in a nearby watchtower, also the mole mask/outfit at dolly sods in the locked room (you can jump through a hole in the roof if you can't lockpick)

The?

Still got it?
---
\+1 to u/Drasca09's comment, thanks!
---
If you play on pc message me and ill join you, im just a lowly lvl 170 tho..
---
Okay thank you. I believe I‚Äôm at the end of raiders and start of free states.
---
\*nod\* bug since the B.E.T.A.    
---
Some day.....
---
I'd add a cargo slot to them that would give them a flat +50 or a 20% reduction of weight to either chems / weapons / ammo / explosives ect ect 
---
this would balance power armor to normal armors giving them both specialized roles rather then just making power armor more and more needed late game for average players
---
Bloodied always does more than anything else, but if you're going to be staying above around 50% health, two shot would do more damage because plasma already has decent accuracy and range, and plasma weapon damage mods dont add that much (if i remember correctly, it's similar to laser rifles at about 12% bonus mod damage)
---
Sorry for the delay, adulting...   
---
New to 8.5 or Old bug?
---
Yea I fixed it, I just needed to relog.
---
How long does it take you to grab a shovel and leave? I do it all the time.
---
yeah its a bit odd since wood the weakest is the only one with a secure window.....
---
Sorry, I think you do get alot more in survival lol
---
A West Tek *** disappears just as I start to loot the body. Also lots of * legendaries don't drop any legendary weapons. Wondering if it's a spawn delay. Takes so long that system times out leaving empty loot.
---
You are right about the mods not doing a ton and I figured it was gonna be two shot so I'll try to go for that, thanks man
---
No sorry!
---
Depends on what your definition of fixed is. I have played since beta, there were issues, but never enough to stop playing. There's a glitch here and there, but buy it, play it, and love it. If you find you don't like it, then stop playing. While you are a lowbie, people may give you stuff to help you out. Accept it with gratitude. Don't be like some little dipshit that betted me for "good stuff" today. If you beg, or ask for stuff, a lot of people will ignore you.
---
Nope, doesn't negate the perk. Makes the gun do dual damage, so it will actually benefit from Heavy Gunner as well as Explosive, although only to it's respect damage types.
---
Say you've got a furious explosive 50cal. 
---
50 damage base, explosive adds 20% so 10 explosive damage
---
heavy gunner 9/9 will add 60% to that base 50 damage, bringing it to 80 base damage. Explosive will add 20% of that, so 16 damage. If you take 5/5 Demolition Expert for 60% more explosive damage, your final values are 80 base damage, and \~26 explosive damage.
---
Ya I just noticed the time, I thought it was minutes but it's hours ü§¶
---
So it basically means, not heavies like launchers right?
---
Alas +100 is too low!
---
And we can‚Äôt build windows with non-broken glass
---
I wonder if he even got queen kill credit. you have to do a minimum % of health damage(I think it's only like 1%) to get credit. I'm not sure a level 4 would be able to do it.
---
The last one tho lol ü§£
---
There are some Scorchbeasts that fly over as part of Events which you can't make hostile and have yellow health bars.  There are some Scorchbeasts in other areas, notably the Cranberry Bog, which also have yellow health bars and don't attack you until you attack them.
---
Meant to say npc
---
It‚Äôs really annoying when you get stuck joining the same fucking server over and over again. Sometimes 8-10 times in a row. I just wanna farm steel but nope, gotta keep wasting my time dumping me in the same spot over and over.
---
Give ya 1000 caps for it
---
&gt;How the hell do you one shot? Jesus Christ I‚Äôm lvl 130 and scorched take 1-2 hits and those flying assholes take about 8. How is everyone so OP in this game?
---
It just comes down to optimizing your build/armor/mutations around your preferred weapon and play style. My bloody melee build does 1300+ with a frigging baseball bat and 600+ with a switchblade if I'm below 40% health. If I drop far enough for nerd rage to kick in that goes up considerably.
---
My level 70 stealth pistol build can take down a level 68 scorched with a couple sneak shots and it's not even optimized yet.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I like the aa on semiautomatic and Furious on the automatic.
---
Quad ffr less rw Tesla, bloodied ffr rw tesla, vamp ffr rw Tesla. These are the most sought after atm
---
I exhaled heavily through my nose when I read this
---
This was happening to me, ended up I was putting my points into perception and luck not endurance for 2 levels
---
Good question, the +50% damage only adds damage if the initial shot connects while the target is below 40% HP. So, if they're at 50%HP and you shoot them, no, it will not add any additional damage whatsoever until you attack again while they're low HP.
---
That the mothman is real (or I am just way to fascinated about it) and that Bethesda should put a new creature in the game that was in a zoo when the bombs dropped
---
Oh really that's a thing didn't know that. It's that the same with all enimies? Seems like a logical way for tagging to work
---
I've seen (been there for) 1:30 kills a patch or two ago. 
---
Absolute max damage queen killing weapon IMO is a primed bloody explosive 15% reload 50cal with a proper low health build. Just baseline damage I'd be sitting at over 400 damage a shot, before Adrenaline, any chem/food buffs, or the Prime bonus damage. And that's with a fire rate of 91... I don't know what that equates to in actual rounds per second but it's higher than an auto handmade, with a much larger capacity magazine.
---
Although a damage stacking bloodied unarmed build who's able to maintain sneak status might beat that. Much slower attack rate but the per-hit damage would be insane.
---
Its a card perk in perception I forget what it's called right now
---
 Sorry for the delay, adulting...   
---
* B.E.T.A. Bug... Didn't notice they added it back... :( 
---
Documented and added
---
* Ugh.... I forgot to add this one back in, thanks.
---
* Added in...
---
* Drill was never really removed, they said it was, but we still saw it... :(
---
Correct. launchers are considered heavy weapons for everything BUT heavy gunner. Their damage bonus comes from demo expert.
---
Just mow through super muties at any of the million camps they have. Easy to kill and easy to find!
---
Alright then, thanks just wanted to make sure I don‚Äôt screw myself over like that.
---
I will... when you carry on in life outside of fallout, please note that lying isn't cute.
---
np. keep in mind though, two shot without explosive adds only 21% real damage on a modded plasma gun, so if you can't get explosive I'd recommend an automatic furious build. Anti-Armor would be preferable, but half the plasma damage is energy, and the anti armor effect doesnt work with energy damage as of now unfortunately
---
Spoiler: Hornwright air purifier site #3
---
Yup. I discovered it a long time ago leveling up a new alt at around level 20 in nuked whitesprings. I kept not getting kill credit when trying to tag with a 10mm pistol. I found that I'd either have to dump the whole mag into them, or hit them with a sniper rifle or something, to get credit.
---
The main places I even come across people:
---
- Flatwoods/Charleston
---
- Whitespring 
---
- Watoga
---
- Morgantown
---
- West Tek
---
I used to be at Charleston, the rocks going up 59 toward the teapot thing. I'd get people at my camp all the time. 
---
 
---
I realized that I should put it on a resource node, so I've moved to numerous ones (lead, steel, acid). I wasn't getting any foot traffic though, since most of those resources are away from main areas (for the most part).
---
I've since moved to a place that has numerous lead/iron veins, and am hoping I don't get foot traffic :)
---
Charleston may be a good place for you, since you get all kinds of levels there at times.
---
Someone give this fellow the Nobel, I need this. The bone raider armor looks nice, can we not have something similar but in the vain of us cultists?
---
nooooooooooooo
---
Yeah, I'm not involved in it. Just letting you know you've got serious attitude issues.
---
Ranting at strangers on the internet obviously is though.
---
And use the bikes to provide a tempary power output, set players to cycle to power your purifier!
---
The radios are a pretty big disappointment all around. They took a fraction of the songs from FO4, added John Denver and Beach Boys, and expected us to be happy.
---
Most fallout music is over 50years old, putting it into public domain territory. There's really no excuse other than laziness.
---
They can always add an actual counter lol. It‚Äôs not like keeping this challenge at 7600 hours is the only possible way to have your hours counted.
---
Same here on XB1, I thought my game was broken when my camp radio wasn't working but then my friends were saying the same thing. It's a bug on Bethesda's end that needs to be fixed
---
That‚Äôs 7-8 hours a day every day since release. I really hope a lot of that was afk time.
---
I figured with how fudged energy weapons have been since launch I'd just stick to the best base damage perk, I'll probably end up with two shot and maybe the one where you get 10% when you ADS all depends.
---
Every comprehensive effect breakdown seems to ignore energy weapons and I prefer to engage in combat from far away so I've never really wanted and automatic plasma so I've been trying to figure out max damage on plasma sniper rifles
---
Thats so weird.. on west tek mutants ive had it were my opening heavy attack does about 35% damage yet a second heavy finishes them off. Which only should lower them to about 30%
---
Not sure if this is what you‚Äôre referring to but I‚Äôve maxed out my shotgun and one of the benefits is cripple and stagger. Also, I think grenades have a chance to cripple as well.
---
Dark wood looks good imo
---
Wait a minute. I‚Äôve never seen one at all, good for poor and xp?
---
Same. Three star explosive railway gun. The other modifiers were terrible though.
---
who said that again? was it godd howard?
---
I really hope you're not worried about how other people spend their time lol
---
Boy scouts is fun, lighten up friend. And I've heard rumors about companions being added in the future (a year or something ahead idr) so perhaps they'll open then. Other than that I'm curious myself
---
&gt;I'll do what I damn well please.
---
...and we'll call you a shit bag for doing it.
---
What's that one?
---
There has been a video on yt about it for a while... ;)
---
I‚Äôm interested. I‚Äôd pay 2000 caps.
---
Me too! I hadn't even discovered it yet and came across Ansel by chance at the same time
---
It ain't the steaming mess it once was (granted it was still playable then), and with all the fresh content and patches it's in a pretty good state right now. So definitely more than playable
---
No lighters. They're scrapped.
---
I was a holdout and I didn‚Äôt expect to ever buy or play it. I‚Äôve been playing since early March and it has flaws but it‚Äôs really fun.
---
It could be someone‚Äôs alt character. I doubt most level 4 players are all the way out at the queen when you hit level 4 just doing the beginner flatwoods quests.
---
West Tek is Hella good. But EVERYONE goes there now. I got bumped aside last night by a lvl 11 bum rushing West Tek back door. Was curious how he was going to die, but found out the placed was just looted do I just jumped servers until I found an untouched West Tek. Took 6 jumps!
---
I did that like 80 levels ago so I am fine now thinks
---
I know I just don't think many people have known about it. My camp has been there for a long time now and never have anyone come to it or had issue with placing my camp when I login.
---
&gt;I‚Äôll one shot whatever I want not my fault my build is stronger than yours
---
A retarded monkey could build a one shot character in this game. You're not special, you're just a fucking asshole.
---
Well, you can only explain so much to a few dense people before you have to get "Real".
---
I think I read somewhere that the gun he uses is a random pistol from your inventory, is this actually true?
---
They knew what they were getting into.
---
/r/woooosh
---
It‚Äôs Enforcer. Shotgun stagger 15%, 30% cripple.
---
Ore veins are instanced, so revealing it doesn't take anything away from you.
---
There *needs* to be DLC elaborating on that tentacle creature in the mine, whether it's the Interloper or some FEV mutant related to the cult.
---
I have a medics auto Tesla. Faster movement while aiming,  +50 to crits and crits heal you and group. That thing can fill the crit meter fast
---
People can build camps over them... preventing you from reaching it.
---
1) Brutal, documenting.
---
2) You do have one of the mods correct? (They removed the accidentally free headlamps.)  
---
Additionally they fixed the naming and there is a separate Red Tactical and Mothman now. 
---
3) Ugh.....
---
4) Noted above, and Bethesda states it was unintentional and will be fixed in the next patch.
---
Works best with Enforcer. Shotgun perk under Agility, seems to proc per pellet. With anything else you're usually better off just killing stuff.
---
If this hurt your feeling, then I got to introduce you to the real world.
---
What stats does it give?
---
I just started a new character. If someone dropped a nuke I would totally show up to tag some stuff for XP.
---
I have so much food spoiling and an overabundance of colas &amp; water that even with speed demon I am constantly throwing food away.
---
&gt;and then auction off the new (probably crappy) gear for more broken gear
---
Lol this made me laugh, fucking true though!
---
I haven't found it either.. But there were several people at WS taking photos üòÇ Running around with a camera lol one got slapped by a charred ghoul as I went by lol I'm killing shit and they're taking pics lol..
---
There's a plan, so you can't learn it by scrapping. The plan is misnamed, so it's called "Pocketed Marine Armor Chest", not deep pocketed.
---
You're condescending and rude. You aren't getting "Real".
---
Nice man!
---
aa?
---
Hey, is the Outfit still for sale? Please add me on psn Se_1983
---
Thx
---
I‚Äôm embarrassed to even ask, but where do you see current hours played? (Xbox, if that matters)
---
None of that is as OP as my 2 shot baseball bat
---
https://youtu.be/r2e1HngLoB4
---
MIRV launcher.
---
I always forget to pick up food so I get left hungry a lot. I need to learn to cook more food if I keep this mutation.üòÖ
---
Solid logic, will document and report.
---
Anti armor. Usually ignores 50% targets armor I think
---
Enforcer w an explosive shotgun cripples anything quickly.
---
He's finally going negative now that people are seeing this post. He's at 0 on the post itself with 48% upvoted.
---
Is that compatible with two shot?
---
I thought it only dropped from Uranium Fever?
---
hmmmm Do we want that fixed?
---
&gt; Upvotes already are telling.
---
You're completely right. They're telling that you're wrong (currently at net 0 on post with only 48% upvote rate).
---
I think it'd be better to put one at the fort since that's where a PVP event is; makes a bit more sense since stash boxes are supposed to be in what basically amounts to player hubs.
---
I agree. Because they think people will shell out cash because it is on a limited time sale. All other PA skins, where marked as NEW and not time limited, so they obviously picking cool items to test whether people will be willing to shell out cash to get it. This BS doesn't work with me and I will never do that out of principal .. it is a very shady practise on Bethesda's part. They need to take a page from rockstar, Rockstar sold billions in shark cards and didn't need to stoop to these levels to do so, they gave people lots of ways to earn cash, but continued to prove you can sell micro transactions and appease the player base who would never buy cards .. this only pushes potential buyers further away .. rich kids will still buy them though.
---
I have a majority of the mutations. They are awesome. I don‚Äôt regret any of them. When I get loaded up with junk and weapons after a nuke run or clearing a few locations I come back to repair armor/weapons, craft chems/food/alcohol/ammo, deposit junk and head back out. It‚Äôs a routine now but yeah I have scorchbeast food that spoils constantly because. I don‚Äôt need all of it.
---
It's double xp weekend. Come meet the new squatch! He's challenging as hell without end game weapons.
---
Thanks! Also, I realize that may have come across as bragging, which wasn't my intent. Tell us your build, playstyle, and preferred weapons and we can help you tune your build to achieve similarly devastating damage.
---
I like both but after a lot of deliberating I decided on the dark. It really depends on the decor. If you have a lot of light or white furniture the light floor goes well, but the dark contrasts nicely, and fits in better with the darker wood tables and end tables.
---
That would be awesome to see.
---
You and u/KillerSpaceGoats are correct, but holding this for the new stuff in 8(.5)  
---
I'll bring back a weapons round up this week.
---
I did the quest in the glass cavern last night for the first time by myself was expecting the biggest battle in the game from what I heard.  Only saw two mirelurks along the way and one scorched or something that tried to get in the way while I bashed away on the lvl 80 Scorchbeast at the end.  Even the scorchbeast seemed weaker than normal hardly did any damage only scratched at me while I kept swinging.
---
Every one I've come across has been a 1*, with double XP weekend you'll get around 1400 XP per squatch. 
---
It's not a guaranteed spawn at each location, but I've always found at least one hitting those three spots
---
94 is supposed to open in the summer, after the Wild Appalachia stuff is done. The roadmap also shows a vault door on the Wastelanders update but someone suggested we may be raiding Fort Knox, as there's a fuckton of gold spilling out and Kentucky (where Fort Knox is located) is right next to West Virginia.
---
And then travel to graveyard phillippi. Back and forth then server hop. 2 minute adventure morty. Twice the coverage no cost
---
I have both but like the look of light wood better.
---
No no I dint take it that way at all! I usually run all rise, a shotty, and a handmade, I play as a medic, and preferred weapons are handmades and hammers lol
---
Interesting point. Will have to look into that
---
Yea, its the Bethesda's style to create game objects. They don't think further how objects really function.
---
How long did it end up staying?
---
I love helping people out on this game.
---
Just helped a new person and explained an entire build out for them via Xbox messages so he could save it for later.
---
Also saw a level 3 the other day, scared him a little with a TSE and was just being playful, then had him follow me to a nice drop of 30 Stims, 40 Water, 30 Radaway, some other aid items.
---
Then made him a Lv5 and Lv10 Hunting Rifle fully modded so he could enjoy himself, alongside 1K Rounds to go with it :)
---
Just nice to have friendly conversations with new or returning people and help them out where I can :D
---
It‚Äôs marketing technique to push the sale - the items are never truly limited as they will surely be re-cycled back in like the golden .44 skin. It‚Äôs just to give the illusion that something is limited to make you buy it now- yes it sucks :(
---
I got a Fury recipe from a WS run today.  It wasn't a drop, I found it in one of the Mirrors/Laundry.
---
I was very surprised.  Of all the times I've done the WS run, I've never gotten a recipe, only chems and other junk.
---
I'd actually like the option of a companion, for when my friends aren't online.
---
I tend to get so side tracked that all my meat and veggies spoil before I even return to my camp, if I can organize myself better I would probably not have a problem with the mutation, but I always seem to forget.
---
I've found one at Lucky Hole Mine on two separate occasions
---
Is this true? I‚Äôm gullible enough to believe it.
---
Same man same, most my friends have either stopped playing or don't get on much so I've been left to fend for my myself
---
You can't learn Tri Barrel by scrapping, but there is a plan. I found it down in the Ash Heap yesterday, but that would be luck. I don't know of many weapon plan spawns on the map. Used to buy them from vendors, but that broke a few patches back.
---
 No indeed, absolutely not, most certainly not, of course not, under no circumstances, by no means, not at all, negative, never, not really, no thanks, nah
---
Filled you in a bit on what condescending behavior really is...
---
Definiton of real is as followed: true, unfeigned, unpretended, unaffected,earnest, fervent, honest, truthful
---
Glad I could be beneficial today...
---
You can solo it if you have decent gear. Otherwise 3 or so people with half decent gear or 5+ if none of you know what you‚Äôre doing going in.
---
I would rather travel across Appalachia and deal with individual faction vendors than go into the Whitespring and hear that line one more damned time.
---
Come on Bethany what the fuck
---
I found the plan there today but it was one I all ready knew (marine combat legs).  
---
Thanks for the help
---
Outside of the mine? Good to know, thanks
---
It fluctuates up and down. Figured all the potatoes are recruiting right now.
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1f7495&amp;d=s92sf2ss2sg2se2l71c72ej4eh2eo2i43a00pe0ee2cm2lt2ae0a21a72aa1&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=38cfgh) is what I run if memory serves me correctly.
---
You do not want Dodgy. I often found myself stranded in the open because something or someone shot me a few times. You want to be able to sprint in order to close the distance.
---
Stealth Boys are the only way you will be successful in Survival. Even going tanky, it can be impossible to close the distance and get a kill. Often I need to hide inside a building and ambush people.
---
Adventure is much better for unarmed. When picking a fight, stay crouched to turn off enemy Vats and jump like a frog to dodge those who actually aim. Do not sprint in a straight line at the enemy. Try to weave slightly back and forth. If going for a duel, stay very close, third person view helps, and lightly tap the jump button. On controller the button to jump and trade are bound to the same button. You have to hold to trade someone, so tapping it will prevent it and cause you to dodge their second shot if they choose to attack back since the trade feature goes away making you jump immediately. Then use Vats to come straight down on them.
---
I feel Cola Nut has some value in the Endurance tree even though I do not use it. A quantum will healer faster than the standard stimpack and for 600 HP. There is also no animation for using.
---
Thankfully, I just started playing a couple weeks ago, so the people I've met are people who are also new or are really dedicated, so they're still playing.
---
rumbling around the forest just outside the mine clearing
---
Highway by Crevasse Dam.
---
I just want a fucking garden bed to put on my roof
---
There is  no point to hoard any junk either, because there is no end game content at all. This game is all about leveling 1-50 and then there is nothing more to see.
---
That's good, stick with them and they'll help you out.
---
Noted, thanks
---
And to be able to plant and grow other items rather than veggies. Like blood leaf or something but it has to meet certain requirements like it has to be grown in water or others can be grown indoors but require watering via a drip system. Nothing too insane you could even skip the watering if you wanted but more plants, more farm oriented stuff, and even if the plants aren‚Äôt functional just add em.
---
They have been. The community is a lot better than other online communities.
---
Fixed; no. 
---
Fun; yes.
---
If anyone is launching let me know also
---
Hell yes. And maybe add +1 strength ;)
---
Same here.  Been trying for over an hour.  think im done with the game...
---
Kk . I‚Äôll be back on in a moment,
---
Sorry for the delay, adulting sucks..  
---
\*nod\* that is correct, was looking at the Lchar and lvl'ed actors.  
---
Edited and submitted
---
I've found it frequently at freds bbq shack I think? The shack near top of the world and the raider spots.
---
Instead of 20 atoms make it 2000 to entice people to achieve this.
---
It‚Äôs better than it was though.
---
Brutal... Added
---
Right i mean we can be drug addicts and addicted to alcohol but not have a smoke??m All the npcs in the other games did it. Also a stat booster for when you sit and smoke, you would loose like, 2 Agi and gain 2 Per, sold sold sold .... Unless there a better idea for that?!
---
232 and I do the same. I can‚Äôt have two characters, I need one that I can keep changing.
---
Wait what
---
You need to just delete this thread and self reflect.
---
Best thing to do is start inviting everyone on the map to a team. Even if just one or two join, people will be curious and look you up on the map and see free range is going on
---
I have the black/grey laminate and it looks fantastic. Hides the dirt :)
---
There is a story here and I want to know!
---
I was a level 14 kinda struggling this week and two high level players let me join their team and got me to 25 in a night and gave me a bunch of plans and chems I desperately needed. Had bought the game at launch, struggled through bugs and crashes and quit at level 14 ‚Äî but between these people helping me, wild Appalachia and the bug fixes, I‚Äôm really loving it now. Honestly the first ten levels are the ‚Äúworst‚Äù part of the game.
---
Nah, It is helpful information to those that don't know how to do the new events.
---
Does it have a quad mag?
---
Sure, if they use the workshop exploit, they can attack you. I'm baffled that it's still not fixed after so many months of it being well known. But a single person coming up to you and trying to trade can't do that
---
I think u need the plans
---
Highlight Item in Bag to Scrap &gt; Click Scrap &gt; Confirm Dialog Is Presented &gt; Power Armor Gets Returned &gt; Hit Scrap Just as Power Armor is returned &gt; Item in slot right above the currently selected item is scrapped instead.
---
Seems like a bug to me.
---
where u spawn in at harpers ferry..they under the bridge
---
Alas building a simple container for dirt and plants is way too complex for us.
---
415 at encryptid his buddy was real close..they both had monster masks on..which scared me lol
---
Sadly no. They broke it a few patches back, so now the vast majority of armor and weapon mod plans can only be acquired by farming world spawns and events.
---
No, it's a plan mod.
---
tbh two builds at once is pretty hard..choose one and do the other on a diff character
---
1.5 and sold.
---
Try removing the walls near the stairs
---
You'll need to build flooring access that removes the restriction, or start from scratch. Stairs can be buggy sometimes.
---
I think it's ridiculous how you build the warehouse door and your guy builds it with broken glass? Smh
---
I use semi auto and full auto rifles...might have to move some points over from strength and agility over to luck
---
Oh no, my feelings.
---
I'm under no obligation to let randoms tag every legendary enemy I come across. Be faster, or go play Fallout 4 if you can't handle sharing a world with others.
---
This is perfect, JUST saw it lastnight on PC, but was in a rush and didn't grab a screenshot.
---
u don't need them just get cranberries
---
You need to essentially remove the whole ceiling and walls supporting the landing of the stairs. Only way I know how to do it.
---
I can drink my whiskey, but I can't light a smoke.
---
No. Not this complaint again. Public resouecea3 should be fought over, period. First come first serve until logoff would suck.
---
You're straight up wrong on your points in the comments.
---
I've tanked all 3 conduits with nothing but excavator and weight perks/crafting cards as I rushed to fast travel in. It isn't difficult. Carry more than 5 stimpacks and it's not a problem.
---
You're calling anyone that has done it a liar, full of personal attacks.
---
It seems like you just can't handle being wrong, so you lash out.
---
You don't come across as smart with how you bite at people. At all. The downvotes are evidence enough. The act is paper thin and no ones falling for it.
---
Hope this is part of the purveyor.  I‚Äôve picked up some nice stuff at lower levels I‚Äôd love to upgrade to max.
---
It's how the game works
---
A legendary bbgun would be perfect for a low ammo cost trash gun.
---
Preach
---
Haha git gud kid
---
I had the x01 jet pack but it was scrapped because of the bug and haven‚Äôt found one since.   Still don‚Äôt have calibrated shocks either. Been using T60 legs.
---
It's not a complaint, not saying I want anything changed. But common sportsmanship and being friendly goes a long way.
---
Oddly enough I got mine from one of Rose‚Äôs quests of all things on an alt.  It‚Äôs 3 agi 3 per.
---
What about the taxidermied alien in the bathroom of the taxidermy shop?
---
Mind would be making some perks passive, like the slower gun breaking one, lock picking, hacking because it's annoying swapping stuff out all the time
---
Workshops and the resources they provide come with the risk of someone else trying to claim it for himself. If you don't want that, it's better if you don't get any Workshops.
---
Agreed.
---
I keep coming back to my Combat Knives. I have souped up most of the very fast weapons, they respond so well to 200% repair, but the knives are just more fun.
---
They should allow 15 on all to tell you the truth
---
I'm right on every single point I made. And I find it laughable that you fell for that dude who said he completed the imposter event solo as a level 32 numerous times without dying once. You can't be that clueless to actually believe that claim can you? Any normal rational person will tell how much of a bullshit lie that is.
---
Thanks, Documenting and reporting!
---
Got em üî•üî•

PS4 added my bad always forget

"Anyone else experiencing issues with the game today"
---
Me everyday, bud. Everyday.
---
The only way is to look at the weight of the piece, from what I‚Äôve found. You can find things on here or the web with what pieces weigh.
---
Plans are found at random spawn points or bought/traded from other players.
---
Ok thanks
---
You misread. He said he held all 3 conduits at once. Not that he did the event alone. 
---
Again. Holding all 3 is easy. I personally try and pick up all 3 EACH TIME unless other people pick them up before I can run to each.
---
Try it. It's not hard.
---
no i do melee i want that 200 % repair for the damage
---
Thanks! I was unaware of SFE.  I have it up and running.  Only downside is that it uses dxgi.dll for injection, which sadly is the same method used by reshade.  Hard choice here!
---
Thank you! At least someone is actually reading the description and realizing it is true problem instead of just coming at me in the comment section and saying I am a big ole meanie. It don't matter if my approach is strong, it still a factual problem that is a issue right now on this game.
---
Thats awesome!
---
SE of the Temple of the Winding Path, there is a small "finger" plateau with slopes on three sides. Easily seen on the map. The northern rim sounds like what you want.
---
I just try to be a humble blackberry farmer and I can‚Äôt line up my crops.
---
If you take a workshop expect to be killed.
---
Thanks for the reply and yes I agree we do have issue every day but this time my character is missing all the PA pieces and I can't aim with a gun when I use the mouse, everything was okay yesterday, was just wondering if other players are having similar issues or for some crazy reason it is just me, have just submitted a ticket with Bethesda let's see how that goes!!!!
---
I would say that's rare for an ore vein. Even so, likely a camp can't cover all of the veins in an area. And what would be the purpose if they're instanced? Also, one could hop servers in the rare event that someone built on a vein that you want to get at.
---
I always love hearing about others wacky builds
---
I use the light. the dark wood was too dark for me.
---
there should be a quest shovel that spawned in a container where you pick up the corpse.
---
Everything floats, pets disappear, a rock the size of a thumb could completely block you from placing any object in the camp, steel walls have the durability of wet paper, hostile monsters teleport inside enclosures and ya, 30 different pots but can not put a single plant in any of them :/ 
---
They have been adding stuff to the atom shop daily and events every month or so but it be nice if they give some real lov'n to the camp aspect on one of these updates.  
---
A green house plans would be cool too I think, or at lest slanted roof windows inside with an option to pot plants.
---
THEY'RE JUST BABIES
---
Yes. My game locks up for a second or two on weapon swap, as well as when I try to go into VATS now.
---
Also when I use my DCG I‚Äôll hear the hit connect but it‚Äôll do no damage
---
It literally warns you before you take it that this may happen.
---
Exactly same with my melee and pa I'd rather have the massive durability increase from repair
---
Drop all the 1 stars and only hoard the 3 stars?
---
I dropped a two shot level 50 hunting rifle in front of a player in Whitesprings the other day. I then went to the bunker and finally got the calibrated shocks for my XO-1.
---
Karma. It‚Äôs real!
---
You couldn't smoke in fo3 afaik, and new Vegas had tobacco chew, which had no negative effects or addiction, and granted higher perception for a short time.
---
When I brought up the solo in my reply to him, he didn't correct me.
---
No issues with names changing back or unequipping, just can't seem to name one thing what I want. Ultracite Power Armor becomes **ULTRACITE POWER ARMOR** no matter what I do.
---
I have a TSE Telsa, it is a beast.
---
I used the SBQ freebies to fix up my T-51B, as it was getting a bit ropey after 40 levels. I've got far more of the things now than I know what to do with though, and I don't intentionally farm the queen. Drop rate might be a bit high.
---
Fuck workshops and  fuck pvp
---
Try removing whatever is attached to the stairs, which probably means removing at least one entire floor/layer. Sometimes you have to remove everything in the entire camp, and you have to do it in the right order or you‚Äôll just keep getting the ‚ÄúNuh-uh!‚Äù message.
---
Med-x is just opiates. Opiate addiction is far more damaging (and has less attention on it) than cigarettes.

Danny and the Juniors - At The Hop (1958)

I had to restart today while doing the watoga Mayor quest. When I would sneak in first person, a...rather gross looking red and pink protrusion that looked like the graphics effing up would stick up on my vision, like my nose disgustingly grew about a half inch and got five inches more bulbous, angled upward.
---
Damn you for posting first! 
---
Upvote
---
Try changing your camp of location and start all over stairs should be at stored tab
---
But why though?
---
Could it be a lag spike? I've noticed that sometimes I have to wait a second.
---
I'm not here to help, just to welcome you to the hell that is building in fallout.....I love it.
---
Yah same on PC they change at the last minute of the song
---
You still in that server?
---
Any random spawn location, seems like.
---
I do believe so,  yes
---
Because it still made sense in the context that he soloed the conduits. Not the entire encounter. Unless he had a glitched solo server every time he did it, there were DEFINITELY other people there. 
---
Then you went for personal attacks calling them a liar. They put their hands up and bowed out due to aggression honestly not being worth the time.
---
I'd have backed out too.
---
So you know, if a post on reddit is "popular" if a view is even remotely shared by a population, it will end up with a "positive" score. More than 50% upvoted with a positive number of upvotes, instead of sitting at 0, which is the lowest a thread can be. 
---
Unlike your comments, which are pretty much all sitting in the negatives. 
---
I get that you don't like it when people don't know how systems work, so I figured I'd explain it to you.
---
One came in handy last night during 3 consecutive SBQ fights.
---
Last laugh, revenant, etc. He dies a lot for the fun of it.
---
Finally someone who actually agrees with me, most people's response is either a troll comment or a generic "It's part of the game, expect to be killed" 
---
I'm Just speaking my mind and get downvoted just for generally wanting a friendly encounter.
---
I get that you farm their fusion cores, just not why only when you're low on flux.
---
There have been 2 or 3 times I was able to wear a mole miner gauntlet while in PA, but I'm not sure if there's a way to replicate it. I didn't do anything special, just seemed to have happened a few times at random, so maybe it's just a rare glitch to get.
---
If I wanted PVP I‚Äôd play Quake or Modern Warfare or something like that. If I wanted PVP in 76 I would play survival. 
---
It comes off as a nuisance to those not wanting to see their camp destroyed or get the workshop overtook. 
---
I get the mechanics. Honestly, I just see the people as griefers although they obviously aren‚Äôt. 
---
At my level I can kick almost anyone‚Äôs ass if I know it‚Äôs coming, it just isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm looking for during a session.
---
Where was the tourist?
---
You guys running now?
---
Ya dude
---
If you have one of every flux you can make your own cores. They are between 108.% and 115% charged of you craft them yourself
---
You can cover all the lead veins and most of the iron veins. Yes hopping servers is always possible, but if more people are collecting ores then more competition with collecting acid
---
Buy them from the vendors
---
 You have to know what the numbers are. You can certainly farm plans. For Heavy I would look at Grafton and down the Railroad to Camden then bottom Stations. 
---
 Real farming is a full time job. ;)
---
Seems like there will soon be a lot of traffic near the Berkeley Springs Train Station. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs flat though.
---
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt hear late gamers asking about cores and you don‚Äôt see them at the workshop.
---
Oh, okay. I knew that, just not anybody that did it. Cheers.
---
They dont show up at the vendors anymore they changed it at least the plans dont
---
The power of the stranger isn't in his damage, but his willingness to eat supersledge hits over and over.

If you don't like PvP don't take workshops, period. If you do take one, expect someone to come along and take it from you at the most inconvenient time. If they're actually interested in the resources and running the place, be shocked. Generally the ones I run into are in groups, will try to bait a shot, and just want caps and PvP. Obviously that'll depend on the workshop, but don't think you're safe just because it's the junk yard or the fair grounds.
---
The most effective way to keep a place is joining a team, copious amounts of missile turrets, locked extractors, and being completely stealthy when you're at the workshop. Don't hang out there ever, go into sneak mode when you pop in to pick up the loot, and don't leave it until you've fast traveled away.
---
Hoping more plant stuff comes when they open vault 94
---
I could see it. I could also see Washington DC. But what id really like to see is zetan spaceships or crazy robobrains like old world blues.
---
He really is very good for leveling up.  Grabs soooo much attention while you pick off enemies.
---
Thanks y‚Äôall
---
Go back and get the ritual mask.
---
Can you reply so I can send karma?
---
I was confused with this too but I figured it out. So when you level up and you go to choose your SPECIAL point, whatever attribute you go into is the one you‚Äôre going to get the point for, regardless of what card you choose. For example, you leveled up. Now you‚Äôre at the SPECIAL screen to choose a point. You go into Strength, but instead of pressing the back button, you go into Perception using the shoulder buttons and choose a card from there. You‚Äôll get the card for Perception, but you‚Äôll get the point for Strength. You must press the back button if you change your mind on what you want to put your SPECIAL point into
---
Someone triggered it last night on a server I was on
---
Vendors sell it frequently. Harpers and Welch I believe.
---
I also do it when I spawn in and a scorchbeast spawns near my camp. They are just so annoying to deal with.
---
I heard the explosive doesn‚Äôt work.
---
The rest stop just below the Investigator's Cabin. 
---
He showed up there the other night while I was fighting Mole Miners who were already there. I checked that spot specifically bc someone else said they saw him there.
---
Tip: Sniping him from the top of the cliff behind the building! He stayed in the parking lot the whole time bc the AI couldn't pathfind up to where I was. If you can jump to the roof, that may be a good spot too. Not sure if he fits through the doorway of the building.
---
Thanks
---
I cant personally confirm or deny, but there was a thread about it on here a few days ago.
---
same here. I was ready to server hop alot like I did for the nuka cola quantum paint, but I got it first try at the tea pot spot.
---
Watching the hockey game then I‚Äôll be on
---
Nope ran in scrapped made ammo and left no hitchs dont be so scared of survival lol it makes you weaker
---
I bought one of the cards at a vendor today because it was 1850 caps, but the I realized there is nothing in that mission that will ever be close to with 1800 caps! 
---
So I haven‚Äôt done it yet.
---
There's a glitch where they'll appear to have zero, but do instead have caps to sell you. Try selling them something even when it says zero if you're sure they should have caps and it will fix the glitch.
---
If you wanna see DC and Zetans, play Fallout 3. If you wanna see Old World Blues content, play New Vegas.
---
I'd rather see locations we haven't done already, and given that the roadmap clearly shows us busting into some place loaded with gold and considering Fort Knox is one of the United States' biggest gold depositories, I'm thinking Kentucky is happening well before we just start rehashing old games.
---
PSN longtrainrollin
---
Good to know!
---
I have a two shot Gatling plasma
---
x3 Fireproof in Endurance. Throw on a padded/dense chest mod and explosives do literally nothing to you. Had a griefer in survival set up at the Whitesprings station trying to take me out with a bunch of fatman nukes. Literally didn't do a thing.
---
3 perk points invalidate 60-70% of super strong weapons. 
---
I personally haven't dealt with too many bloodied builds, I usually see those people laying out mobs in regular mode. Few times I have encountered them in survival, I ended up somehow having a reasonably fair fight. Even with that much defense they can still drop if you out maneuver them. The only time I've been caught be a stealthed bloodied melee build had me in my Excavator with reactive plates equipped. I died as I was already at about half health, but he killed himself in one hit when attacking me. I was the first one back to the corpses and took all of his junk along with picking up mine.
---
It takes some planning, but you really can roll over even the most annoyingly built players with a little bit of prep. If you have that prep, you'll usually win too, as those people are way too used to an auto kill to actually put up a fight when you bite back.
---
If you join a survival server and you are repeatedly griefed, I suggest switching servers. 9/10 servers I've been on had very few people actively seeking out targets. Keep your kill count down if you want to quest for extra XP, and avoid the biggest train stations. Doing so keeps you pretty damn safe. 
---
Majorly aggressive people died down quite a bit once the first week of survival ended. Chain griefing is definitely not the norm anymore.
---
Sorry you had a bad experience. Change a few things though, and the suspense of whether a stranger wants to shoot or whether a friendly wave might lead to being left alone becomes a bit more fun.
---
Precisely. Bone Raider is a step in the right direction, but it‚Äôs still too clearly Raider armor. We need something that‚Äôs clearly Cultist based. Maybe a big ram horned set covered in fur for the Sheepsquatch. Or an X-01 set with big Mothman eye lenses, among other things.
---
I have this glitch all the time. Just sell something to the vendors, even though it shows their money as "zero" . Their money number should reset, less the value of whatever you just sold then.
---
Too damn awesome to not be upvoted to the skies
---
Sry too late already used my caps on something else
---
Maybe some vines wrapping around it like the statues in the cultist sites.
---
Will stay 15 minutes
---
I had the same problem but I went back a second time and it worked.  What I did differently was removing and rewearing the uniform and hat before taking the photo since that's what seemed to not be registering.
---
I'm at the harpers ferry vendor staring at the heavy combat armor arms plan as we speak. If you don't have light and sturdy learned, heavy won't show up.
---
They had mentioned a mod for backpacks to increase food decay time.
---
That's gorgeous
---
There is a strange and beautiful art to it.
---
Oh thank you so much
---
Seriously, what the hell is his coat made of? Is this how the Vault-Tec Rep survived 200+ years and why Bethesda won't put it in the shop despite being in the files since day 1?
---
I just got the crossbow prime plan.  Rare?
---
Yeah this was an idea so you wouldn't need that mod all the time on yoiur backpack.
---
Plus then you could make rhings like radstag salami
---
I'm interested, what are the base stats?
---
Oh thank you so much  I know how to get the sturdy but what about the normal
---
At least this is a constructive comment. I understand like most that taking a workshop has risks and you gotta expect to be killed if someone contests it and just wants you dead. 
---
I never stick around workshops and use extractors, I only use them for the claiming and defend event so I can earn easy XP and hopefully a new plan then I'm on my way. I usually end up defending people's workshops for them. Whole point of my post is just to get the message across that being friendly goes a long way, if he claimed it without shooting at me fair enough I'd have walked away but he purposefully killed me, used my loot as bait and stole it when I didn't come for it.
---
you have to get them in order. Light, sturdy, and then heavy.
---
Any vendors in specific
---
This is exactly what it should have been.  I was just as confused as you. Figured it out but honestly, they just aren‚Äôt worth the hassle.
---
Does he have any mutations to accompany his build?
---
watoga and harpers ferry
---
Or back out and back in a few times from an interaction.
---
Thanks again
---
Kinda, yea so your looking for places where plans spawn next to an armor workbench, there are a few of these around and they will produce specifically armor plans, combat armor being in that list.  
---
The one at grafton steel is probably the most popular, I got BOS combat armor chest there yesterday.  There is also the one at top of the world near the shooting range.

---
You can get in there without glitching out the game.  There's a walk-through wall on the left side in MODUS' server room in Production behind the Robotics door.  You'll need marsupial and/or a jetpack.  Make sure you stand on pipes and boxes once you've walked through the wall.  If you fall through the floor completely it resets you to the bunker entrance outside the vault.  If you fall into a room, you just land in that room.
---
I gathered 20 guns from enemies and 40 beer bottles in adventure then did the rest in survival. No problems
---
After you read the plans, it should be in the wall decorations section and it would be grouped together with the sheepsquatch and nukashine quest posters from the atom shop
---
Anti armor and two shot are both main prefixes so will not be combined.
---
It is. Kill a enemy, remember how much xp it gives, take a berry mentats, then kill a enemy of the exact same type and level, you‚Äôll get more xp.
---
For me most things are ether over priced or don't look good you want a good bu how about a foundation reskin or a good armor reskin.
---
I like the wood skins but they look weird as a second floor for a concrete floor first floor.
---
It looks like you fell into the developer room where the developers test new stuff, except it didn't work out right.
---
Nope but I moved it. Actually had to because 5 hops and camp placement denied every time. I went to the area to use their benches and there was nothing there. I think people have everything stored so there's nothing to destroy. Anyways I was glad I placed my camp so reclusive because I felt like it was a big neon f'k with me sign in survival.
---
With Fix It Good, Weapon Artisan,  and the ability to server hop, no.
---
No benefit to either method though other than taking some cool screenshots for your loading screen! :) maybe even stealing the presidential alarm clock!
---
It‚Äôs not really the level difference... I mean, level after 50 really just reflects the amount of time you‚Äôve put in the same character. It does potentially mean there‚Äôs more time to have gotten better gear, but that‚Äôs about it. Strategy is what really matters, and you really have to bring your A-game. I hoped on earlier, and saw that someone had just gotten a kill. I apprehensively fast traveled there to try to stomp on the remaining dude... but it was a trick. One must have let himself get killed. They were actually working together and had been lying in wait for players looking for a kill.
---
What was the name of this Biv test?

I just found them in Flatwoods at the armor bench. Got lucky, only took 7 server hops.
---
From what i gather, there was a split of mothman cultists that left west virginia under the mothmans word of danger, and there was a group that settled in lucky hole mine, found the interloper and well.... we all know what happens next...
---
You can't even get rid of the hunger and thirst by taking Rad-X.  :(
---
Yeah, but none in particular. It's an explosive build.
---
Yes that‚Äôs the funny part.  Troll people who are farming and shoot the gun to heal them.
---
Well, how do you know they're false ?
---
yeah but it isn't one you can find though the discord app, that's my thought
---
But you‚Äôre literally posting on a subreddit where you can follow an invite link from said sub to the discord you just said doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
Haha yeah, I didn't swipe anything when I peeked around in there.  I didn't know if any of the items were coded like the ones in the dev rooms people were warping into, and I didn't wanna risk a ban for it.
---

Zetans have several different types in the game files, including Star Admirals, but they do not spawn yet.

PA is for beginners. I only use it for nuked zones. I rather use that flux to make mutation serums instead. Fusion cores are easier to come by, IMO.

I don‚Äôt think there is anything you can do. Wipe your tears and pull up your pants :( I had to do the same. It wasn‚Äôt easy.

Agreed. And being one of them, along with the 1.8k that have upvoted thus far, I‚Äôm not alone. 
---
My second request would be to strongly increase the cap limit, which is admittedly yet another request that would benefit whales such as myself. 
---
I assume, of course, that by ‚Äúwhales‚Äù you are referring to the Las Vegas nomenclature definition of high limit players in casinos versus a juvenile jab at overweight players, as most Fallout 76 players have a degree of maturity that exceeds most other games, but I could be wrong.
---
Thanks, my list is growing well now lol

This would be great too. :D

Making jerky would be a cool feature in  game!

Which is why fallout changes the names of their Chems, medx= morphine, jet= meth, psycho= pcp. They were planning on using the real names back in fallout 1, but was forced to change them to their current names due to Australia.
---
Maxed out gunsmith I can go a couple days of near constant usage without needing to repair. The Tesla rifle I made weeks ago hasn‚Äôt even been repaired once yet. I think repair kits could be worth it for SBQ/burrows runs as a quick solution to broken PA parts

Easy! 2. Catcher
---
Well, with the 2k+ cap cost, the semi-regular invisible body bug, and the number of people who still don't hit the pylons, I am guessing nobody does it without an organized group. I might try to form a group in the future to use up my freebie.
---
A loud verbal "fuck no, thank you kindly" seems to work better than half the time ;)
---
Smartassery aside, chat works.
---
lol, that would have been awesome
---
I love new players and low levels, and help them out when I can.  However imposter and SBQ are two places they don‚Äôt belong, but keep on showing up to.  
---
Frankly there are too many people that show up that can‚Äôt put out the damage, stay alive and soak a conduit, or be of much use, and it ends up making the fights harder than they should be, people lose, get tired of the wasted stimpacks and ammo, and just go do other things.
---
One might say ‚Äúwell screw the lowbies and undergeared, in my day we were THANKFUL for those legendary drills.‚Äù  however I disagree.  The fact we have disappearing legendary corpses, and the (somewhat rarer) corpses that have nothing, combined with 3 star legendaries not dropping 3 star items means that you have to put some of the blame on Bethesda.  This is just what world bosses are like.  
---
I look forward to the instanced content, but I‚Äôm not too hopeful.
---
You can also farm mutations with server hopping, i.e. whatever hidden cooldown tehre is on gaining a mutation (30mins or so?) gets reset if you relog.
---
Nah I‚Äôm just destroying any dropped repair kits. Not adding to any tracked metrics for players using them.
---
\*furiously tapping the panic button under desk\* Interesting.

Did they remove them from the game?

What‚Äôs the lowest level hazmat suit and where do you get it?

Is gatling laser or gun?

I think we‚Äôre asking too much if we want the park card to do what it says it does.

The ultracite gatling laser comes equipped to fire ultracite fusion cores. I got one from a scorch beast drop. I was looking for the plans before that and they can also drop as a quest reward.
---
I recently got the prime plans for a laser gatling . So what I'm saying is the ultracite gating laser is ready to go from my experience.
---
This also it's so easy to grind for caps you could easily get anything you want in a few days. So limited sales push a sense of urgency upon you to buy Atoms.
---
After I took the 3rd rank of Enforcer I went to the Whitesprings golf club with a pump-action with the intent to oneman the place. Standing outside of the door I managed to stop every ghoul that came at me, and soon I had a whole carpet of angry radzombies groaning at me underfoot. Not bad for a lvl33: support builds can be VERY viable in this game
---
Why would they ?
---
Oh it works, just that it doesn't spread and tag others like a normal/charging barrel does.
---
Appreciate it pal and I‚Äôm sorry about that
---
Exactly this.
---
Private  message  me when you can
---
Thats not entirely true what so ever. Why dont you join the party then. I dont use assasins what so ever and im harder to take down then most with it lol. Its not always the armor you have to worry about and a well place shot to the head negats all armor. Take your time take aim and let em have it. Hide your aid and junk what is there to loose at that loint besodes 5 min of your time
---
That's a really good idea, however I can imagine that it would always be full and people would just try initiate trade with you. It would work if they disabled trade on that mode so people would come and go
---
Ps4 already has one
---
It's like having expectations and you know what they say about having expectations
---
I got Holstein's, Cominsky's, and Allemane's codes from the Big Bend Tunnel, on bodies of fire breathers.  It would probably make sense the 4th one is in there too and I just didn't find it.  Came here because I was looking to figure out what to do with them.  I think 2 of the codes are on fire breathers bodies right outside of the tunnels.
---
well I waa thinking like player vendor stand technically I did think it could be trade spam well they would need to add a chat lol
---
Pretty much everything in the game has been duped. If you‚Äôve traded more than once chances are you‚Äôve had a duped item. Get off your high horse üòÇ have fun with your zealots explosive 50 cal while the rest of the game has aae rifles and shit
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one. Even the glowing ghouls. Something about it just seems so damn depressing. The hardest for me is the Yao Guai.
---
I have the plan for "Ultracite Gatling Laser Prime Reciever." 
---
From what I've read, it looks like the ultracite gatling laser normally uses regular fusion cores, and it  fires green lasers.
---
After attaching the prime reciever, it uses ultracite fusion cores.
---
What I'm saying is, I want those green lasers lol
---
I was think more like WoW or startrek online etc with one large auction house where you place your item in the auction and set a start price and a buy it now price. The item goes from your inventory and it either sells or you get it back
---
It's certainly playable, though I'd keep active on the forums here to learn about what is and is not a bug. Fallout 76 is an amazing environment to play around in, and the longer Bethesda keeps it running the more they'll add to the game. It's starting to feel more full already: even if you decide to hold off now check back in a few months as it's something that will get more full and complex with time. I'm having a LOT of fun with it, as have a lot of this online community as well
---
it may not be true for all cases but it is for most survival servers I join
---
I crapped mine and they turned into the deathclaw statues  that I had bought from the Atom Shop.
---
Rumour is it‚Äôs been removed. So maybe this is what‚Äôs left of it.
---
Let me also add, I obviously do not have one, so I could very easily be wrong
---
There isnt very many servers to begin with. And frankly man ive killed tougher with no armor on and a lvl 15 bloodied handmade lol just have to know the approach
---
I dont think this engine will be able to handle that, granted this engine work like a database but sto or eso work on a completely diffrent concepts geared for this kind of system
---
fallout is more of a engine that might not be able to handle that kind of trade system due to how to handle the engine register item in inventory
---
Spicy deathclaw jerky.
---
Doing this I found it 3 different times with all of my characters. Pretty sure it‚Äôs guaranteed to spawn SOMEWHERE in every server. Getting friends to help you look speeds up the process even more. Server hopping just lowers your chances, if anything.
---
my usual approach;
---
‚ÄúHey man, have you ever touched a girls hand?‚Äù And he usually gives a nervous chuckle, and then I give him a high five and say ‚ÄúIt would probably feel like that, but a bit softer.‚Äù

maybe if they didn't move, but the engine allows for a certain amount of "air control" so they could probably break out of it. Also, I'd suspect that there'd be a delay between triggers that might make it a little less epic

I‚Äôm not handing out free cookies, but you‚Äôd be surprised how tanky you can be without any sent/assassin armor.

Lmao. There‚Äôs only like four items anyway you can get I got them all. So of course you‚Äôre gonna get dupes. Wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs broken.
---
It's already in the game since we have npc vendors in the world also we had them in fallout 4
---
Nope, I just gathered everything in adventure and switched servers for the 3 minutes it took to scrap and craft everything. Doubt I even made it on anyone‚Äôs radar. But I‚Äôve had fun with previous survival challenges. Died once when I ended up on the leaderboard and ignored it doing quests, but I ended up on the leaderboard from a previous foray when I‚Äôd gotten a kill on someone who was trying to hunt me. Ambushed him in a dark room. And I‚Äôm not a PvP build by any means, hell at the time I was like level 40 with generic armor.

Did you read the plan?

Yep, sometimes the game just eats items. I have so far lost a piece of power armor, and the white responders helmet.
---
I got the same one and was kinda dissatisfied that it had no lights or anythinf like that. Do you happen to have a guide and a list of parts used to get it functioning?
---
No idea. Could be. I'd like to think that all those people are playing on Survival now, but there are always people who can only get their jollies on by ruining someone else's fun.

I wish we could set them lower and that we also had a diagonal fence part for when we encounter hills or inclines.

---
They would never sell a kit with lights and sound for $150, hence why its a replica kit.
---
Type in "Punished Props Pipboy 2000" and there is a tutorial on how to do it!
---
I'm convinced I have the worst RNG ever. Every single 3* legend drops a 1 star or at best 2 star useless item, have yet to even see the sheepsquach event OR the camera  appear despite endless server hopping. Not to mention even going to the borrows while nuked yields like maybe 2 legendary ghouls per run.
---
Why would you say that about Walter and his *soothing voice*
---
I really don't understand why they didn't port over the planter boxes from FO4
---
I cam craft on PS4
---
Yup.
---
Trying to put a fence around my garden almost did my fucking head in the other day....
---
Look for the snake on the map, a little S of Whitespring. It‚Äôs a lovely spot with water and street lamps around. Nobody‚Äôs golfing anymore, so move right on in.
---
Nah, you're correct. One of my friends is a gatling laser fan, so we went through all that, green lasers and all.
---
We found our ultracite gatling laser on the SBQ, but that's the only one I've seen. Your best bet is to trade, as they're not that popular.
---
... Having actually tried to play GTAV post-hack reform, yeah, no. Rockstar was painfully blatant in their money grab, only instead of pretending items were limited time, they instead pretended it was worth so much that you'd have to actually live, eat, and breath GTA to buy them.
---
I don't object on moral grounds (gotta make money somehow), but your statement is somewhat ludicrous (assuming they did not significantly upscale the rewards from base gameplay in the past year).
---
This. I spent a very, very long time playing with a level 30 range TSE shotgun, and even post-patch the thing will tear up high level threats like crazy.
---
Only 245 here, but was so shocked to see it from Uranium Fever a week or so back.  I just assumed it didn't exist.  Still don't have Protected.  nor Casual Prot/Shielded
---
What's your price? Let me know mats and I can provide
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
As far as I can tell, it still requires you to paste urls of your builds. How else are you going to save them?
---
So there‚Äôs a tricky work around for this. There‚Äôs a YouTube video that explains it, but you basically need to fanangle two separate power lines to the door from the generator. It‚Äôs confusing at first but then you get the hang of it
---
Haha. Bethesda is just jealous of my fancy new gun ;)
---
I've got a quad assaultron head, holds 20 fusion cells and will take more enemies down with one good hit. Just takes forever to shove another 20 fusion cells into it
---
Nice, i got it from one of the raider main quests after completing it on my lv50+ character
---
Thank you for this explanation, I've been confused from the get go lol
---
You provide materials, I'll do it for free.
---
It's a nice gun. I run one as a fallback weapon or when I'm taking out  lower level stuff. When I was rile build it was one of my favorite to shoot -- has nice handling. What killed it for me was how hard it was to get mods/plans. They are expensive (springs, screws) to make so  unlocking mods are no joke.
---
Personally if I see a workshops owned.  I go there claim the workshop, kill the individual and then just move on I don't want the workshops.  So any individuals that don't want PVP don't claim workshops
---
Agreed.. 7600+ hours for 20 atoms? You can keep the 20 at that point.
---
Iij fu
---
You establish your dominance as the Scorchbeast KING and command her to land or else. She will recognize your Alpha-ness and land immediately.
---
I dont need any armor durability perks anymore. Goodbye whiteknight, active gunsmith, luck of the draw, luky break. I just use the repair kits as a direct perk advantage to never worry about repairs again. Just use my stack and no worries about breakage. So i put those free perks into pvp cards. Just kidding, i dont support this. but you could totally do that for a p2w advantage.
---
Saw that exact video, if I had to guess. Thanks!
---
I found it on the top shelf of a windmill just below Top Of The World.  I‚Äôm sure it was a random span and didn‚Äôt realize what I had as you can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs on that shelf.  Dumb luck.  There is also a mod available from the vendor in either Harper‚Äôs Ferry or Watoga.
---
100% agree
---
Well, if you‚Äôre on PC I can craft both
---
PS4. Thanks though
---
You could be right. It shoots a lighter green colour than a prime gatling laser. I may have modified mine -  I've had it awhile. It's a fav of mine.
---
The glitch will also sometimes let you "use" the fist weapon but get none of the damage increase from it.
---
We have the same occupation I see. Acid farming and finding ore are my specialties. The legendary hunt part is way less successful, unfortunately.
---
Taming pets because your last one magically vanished upon loading in - Server Hop.
---
pc or console? did you rename it? can you recreate your steps, what happened *exactly*?
---
you were chilling in your camp, did you quit through the menu? or did you forcefully closed it? more importantly, what were you doing prior to that?
---
It's broken everywhere.
---
Can confirm what I've stated, with my Instigating Handmade and the +250DR sticking around for ***quite*** a long time. Much longer than 10 seconds, that's for sure, that is.. until I fire it, lower it, or Pacify something.
---
But what I **can't** confirm is your claim... And I have an idea as to perhaps what you were seeing happen...  
---
I think that you were initially Hidden, and so you were actually doing ***4x*** ***damage***; however, then you started to enter combat and it was only doing the normal 2x to full-health enemies, and as a result it seemed much less. 
---
At least that's what happened to me.
---
Cool
---
WEST TEK. All the steel you need will be delivered to you there. I get ,500 - 600 steel there on a complete run with scrapper.
---
Oooh, gotcha; it's a shame there's not more options for Fist weapons. I'd gladly use a perk that lets me rock my Deathclaw Gauntlet in PA!
---
Legitimately what I thought the first few times it happened haha
---
Probably nor, since that would be "an advantage" and not purely cosmetic which they promised would nev... oh wait. /end sarcasm  
---
But seriously, must be purely cosmetic, although, you'd have to remove any over-armor for it to show?
---
I feel like the ones who did that can't handle survival and are still here.
---
pc or console? did you rename it? what did you do before you fast traveled, *exactly*?
---
the weapon broke and you went to fix it. did you notice whether the server was laggy or acting up? did you repair it with a kit or in a workbench?
---
Sorry for being vague, I repaired it with the workbench (supplies from my storage) it wasn't renamed and it was on playstation 4 from my knowledge everything was working fine, I completed monster mash pvp just before I fast travelled home to fix it.
---
Dear Diary..
---
That other dude LITERALLY said this was a reason for no cig use in FO76 lolz.
---
He said other countries might not allow it, and you LITERALLY just proved him right.
---
He didn‚Äôt need all the info you found &amp; still knew what he was talking about, you Reddit high horse nerds are funny!
---
Nice. Are these just mods to the original staff you get?
---
You must be way past the end game
---
Do you know if free range will disappear like faschnat??
---
Screws springs acid nuclear material steel aluminum plastic gears ballistic fiber lead wood
---
Hey, mock me, but it was a 12-minute fight. :P
---
Some crypid themed power armor they could do are: 
---
Flat wood monster skin that looks like a spacesuit. 
---
Grafton monster with armor that covers the head. 
---
Wendigo skin that has claws for unarmed combat.
---
Which is a long fight tbh
---
That looks horrible
---
Yeah its annoying having everyone repeatedly request for my main weapon, yet they decline a 100 caps Witch Costume as the price is too high,,, there's no way my 4* Bloodied PA 40% 1+STR and Sacrificial Mod is not worth any amount of your caps especially if you cannot afford a 100 caps for an outfit.
---
It broke during the monster mash and after the event, fast travelled home, fixed it and after I fixed it. It wouldn't let me equip it, i fast travelled again, this time going to watoga hospital and it just disappeared from my inventory and favourite bar
---
If you don't want to be on a node, you get get most everything you need some other way. Just move and figure out how to get whatever you are on a node for.
---
Hate to say this but you will have to keep a lot of junk. It's not till later you find out what you really need. Things like acid, copper, glass, you won't need as much, but aluminum, lead, circuits, ballistic fibers, you'll need alot.
---
It seemed to short to me. But was still fun I felt
---
Yeah thanks for the tip. I‚Äôm mostly meaning do you need things like bone or glass or cloth cause I‚Äôm completely done with my camp
---
But aren't we all supposed to use the (garbage) atomic version? ... ree?
---
/s
---
oh what, seriously?
---
I've been turning effects volume DOWN while turning base volume up this whole time ‚Ä¶..
---
I'll gladly do it because I have nothing else to spend my caps on, it's just a shame that theres an unnecessary 3 or 4 hour cooldown period per server. Server hopping doesn't even help bevause someone may have done it previously on the server.
---
Idk I haven't purchased any of those. Only used the improved ones I get for downing the old beast.
---
a lot. As much until you start making armor, mods for weapons and such
---
It‚Äôs impossible to prove an impossibility, so I‚Äôd rather have your evidence of its truth
---
I am currently at 20/22 diseases.
---
I have gotten sludge lung and it hasn't counted.
---
I have had it as I have entered into a new server and it hasn't counted 
---
I had other diseases before I got sludge lung and those have counted
---
Pls make videos
---
Btw the new vendors inside the whitespring aren't marked essential. ive walked in on dead vendors, and no vendor at all. super fun.
---
Trying desperately to find the flatwoods monster
---
If you still haven't figured it out, go to "Craft"-"Quest Items", crafting a uplink using the broken one will get you to the next step.
---
You have to go down each item and hit right on each one to cycle through
---
I randomly had a Legendary Sheepsquatch pop out my the Sons of Same compound, but I ran
---
Absolutely this....
---
Some of the "rewards" do not seem balance for the effort or time taken for some challenges
---
Yea the game doesn‚Äôt really explain this for some reason
---
I‚Äôve been in a 5 minute one
---
RDR2 likely gets a pass by being a "period piece". If it's set in an older time when smokes were common, it gets a by.
---
Console and nope and yes I‚Äôve been to every location I had been and yes I quit through the menu then I closed the application fully once I had returned to the main menu and I was putting neon signs and letters on the outside wall of my camp
---
I‚Äôm in but low level
---
Let‚Äôs do it! If we fail. I‚Äôll just get another one on a new server.
---
It's easy alone, too. It's neat, but not anything difficult. I've read about level 17s clearing it easy, too, so it's not just high level "god" characters.
---
Have you tried relogging a few times. I've had stuff vanish and sometimes duplicate, bit a relogging and/or a console hard reset usually fixes it. But yeah real gear disappearances have been reported with no resolution... Just be ready for half the people here to call you a liar.
---
no problem. unfortunately there's nothing you can do. Bethesda won't restore lost items. if you're still in the same server, try looking around for a baggie where you lost it.
---
so it broke during monster mash? but when you fast traveled after it was done, the gun was still in your inventory, right? if so, it's very important that you try and remember what happened during that timeframe, between that 1st fast travel and the 2nd one to Watoga.
---
was the server laggy or just acting weird? on PC, the repair button is the same as the drop button. is this the case on PS4? do you remember if you messed around your pipboy?
---
Holy shit, absolutely no to your statement about Rockstar. Have you actually played their games online, they are the near the peak of money grabby, grindfest games out there. Each update that came out was just another type of business you had to blow all your money on, just to unlock the ability to grind to get the new content. Hackers spawning money was almost the only way to actually have fun and not play it like a job. Sure all the new content is "free" but fuck man, no.
---
why would you want to it's disgusting
---
Correct. Great PvE sniper perk, not the greatest for anything else
---
Because I‚Äôd like the choice to do so.
---
The only ways cash shops make enough money is by releasing items people NEED to buy NOW, either due to their necessity or their exclusivity. Be thankful that for now Bethesda has decided to stick to the later rather than the former.
---
I'm a late gamer and I take the workshop. So do all my late gamer friends. We are a multitude. It's easy. We just don't complain about getting killed on Reddit. We do that to each other if it happens. Flux is for ammo and serums and mods. I wouldn't waste it on a core I could get for five minutes of workshop ownership. Ridiculous.
---
You should probably delete this post then
---
was the server laggy or just acting weird? do you think you could remember everything you did, starting from your last fast travel before quitting the game, up to when you closed it?
---
and this is an odd question, but where you pressing buttons particularly fast? like, before the prompt showed up, you know, kinda just mashing them?
---
It was my choice to tell you to eff off? I dunno just wanted to break the chain.
---
That's what the workshop exploit is. A friend tries and immediately stops taking a workshop, and because of the braindead way that party PvP is handled, that immediately lets that friend's party members attack you. No matter where you are
---
They‚Äôre not adding NPCs
---
How do you even get it?, I finish the quest that leads to the radio pylons..then nothing?
---
Good luck, buddy.
---
But do you fink I'm freaky?
---
Moment of shame: are all of these fallout references? I got this mug as a freebie from comiccon Dubai ... I have no idea what any of the references are üòÇ
---
The same as here, I'm down to play
---
They don't take up inventory space, so I suppose they'll just accumulate. I really don't see myself using them often if at all.
---
also good for hard hitting melee and shotguns.. but ONLY if you do not have mutations or mods that damage enemies on your armor, no Tesla coils, no Plague walker, No electrically charged or unstable isotope
---
I already went back and made sure, checked my stash as well (I was in my camp when it happened) and no, nothing weird or nothing messed up, it only started messing up after I repaired it. It just wouldn't let me equip it, tried a few times then went off my pip boy, tried to equip it from my favourite bar. Nothing. Then fast traveled and then it just disappeared.
---
Here and there the normal hitches and yes I fast traveled from site alpha to my camp then walked to the whitesprings then bought the signs and lights plan and sprinted back to my camp and started placing letters and nope
---
I thought it was .1 but I could be mistake. They really are convenient. Idk if you can. Trade them or drop them, but if you don't use em, I'll take em.
---
Bumped into the sheepsquatch in the Ash heap, a level 68 legendary version.    I'm only lvl29 so took forever to get it to half health then it healed almost back to full health.   Is this supposed to happen?
---
Trick is you have to go out back behind your shack to smoke em. Parents are over, can't let them see you smoking and all.
---
Thanks!
---
i keep a minimum of 20 of everything, incase i need it
---
I'm like lvl 150, idk, I mean I don't have all perks yet. I don't have a ton of 3\* gear yet. I for sure could have solo'd this. It's just disappointing, because it was billed as a dungeon, and honestly a nuke silo is harder for me.
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
masterpiece
---
LOL. 
---
False equivalency. I wouldn't pay 10 caps for any outfit. Even if I has 25k caps.
---
 Excellent for cleaning up adds, like the Scorched that come with a Beast. I can one shot most of em'. ;)
---
Yeah, it's neat, but exactly... what was the challenge. And with only a few legendary enemies?
---
Yeah, the quad single load weapons are nice when loaded, but a complete PITA when you have to reload. Had a quad pump and it just takes an eternity if your in combat to reload. Though on the bright side you can stop loading and fire when need be.
---
Seen this one also. Had a helluva time finding anything to kill last night because enemies were dropping dead the moment I got in range. Weird bug.
---
Adhesive! Take as much glue as you can find.
---
did you sell anything to the vendor? another weird question, but it's been forever since I last played on PS4: is the "drop" button used for anything inside the camp builder?
---
Because the hive-mind hipsters say you so.  I know it's stupid!
---
/s last post.    I can wipe the borrows solo on one of my 3 toons in 5 mins.  3 different builds.
---
It shows,
---
Wouldn't that be negative carry weight? I mean if you're going for gains you hit muscle failure.
---
Ah. 
---
Well, it would seem that if that were the case, I would have taken damage. He tried to attack me only seconds before he killed the other player.
---
As someone addicted to alchemy in certain other games I would love to be able to dry out flowers and grain. Prob removes spoilage but makes takes 3 to  make one preserved item.
---
I feel they need to do 3 or 5 man raids lvl 100+ mobs instanced with a boss around he difficulty of the imposters Sheepsquatch
---
Ugh, just frustrating. I'm all for new content, but why build it up and overhype it? Back to grinding for 3\* legendaries I guess.
---
I had one spawn in me south of Whitesprings near the fissure. While I fought it the scorchbeast attacked it. And then a Deathclaw spawned and got scorched, and then an albino Deathclaw spawned. It was an amazingly epic battle and they totally helped me take him down.
---
Nothing happens at the end of lying low for me, took me to the pylons then nada.
---
You're not doing it right if you aren't killed 5 times by the sheepsquatch.
---
Ya know, I fought against server hopping (myself) for a long time. I couldn't resist during Faschnat, trying to get all the costumes and plans/recipes. Now I server hop all the time. I'm server hopping right now. I've spent an entire day server hopping. While it's great for making sure you get everything, it really does take the fun out of it. I wish they would ensure that 1 of everything is always in play SOMEWHERE in the map. That would encrouage me to go from spot to spot checking, which isn't half as bad because at least I'd still be looting and doing other things while on my way there.
---
Unless you use an unarmed weapon you normally won't use bone shards. Everything has uses though, waste acid is great for smelting iron and lead ore. As well as making gun powder and if you are making gun powder you need cloth. Oh and if you don't run power armor you will rarely use aluminum and black titanium (in my exprience).
---
They can't be traded or dropped
---
Do these stack?
---
That sounds incredibly epic, indeed haha I love it
---
Then why can I smoke cigarettes in Grand theft auto and red dead redemption?
---
I agree; I half expected The Burrows to be instanced. The enemies in there should have scaled to the average level of our group. Instead I was 1-shotting everything. Yawn.
---
Plus if someone else was in there before you, the junk is all gone, and that's the best part of it. Sure, you might get a legendary, but chances are not.
---
sorry for all the question but this has happened a total of 3 times to me and, as you can guess, Bethesda doesn't care. doesn't help that this sub seems to think it's all an elaborate ruse. been trying to get to the root of it.
---
what did you, exactly, between arriving from the fast travel from monster mash up to when you fixed it? what about the drop button inside the pipboy? when you repair something, is it the same?
---
24 glowing blood that was all and it‚Äôs used to bring up the scrap or store or replace menu also then will be used to store stuff
---
That‚Äôs where I found her this morning!
---
LOL
---
They are literally NOT p2w.
---
P2W provides a buyer with an advantage over other players, repair kits are available for FREE for EVERYONE by killing SBQ, Ive got 30 of the BETTER free kit right now...
---
And NO not everyone that went to Survival switched back either. 
---
Survival is still alive &amp; well.
---
Both server types serve a purpose.
---
One to farm &amp; take it easy in, the other for a more tense survival environment.
---
Only fuckin‚Äô crybabies care about a bullshit leaderboard anyway. 
---
Its BETHESDAs game, they can do whatever they want with it. Play it or dont, but for fucks sake stop with the constant crying over dumb shit you dont even understand.
---
Fuckin‚Äô goombas, y‚Äôall cry way too much.
---
Most that PvP 1shot kill, which allows ZERO time to crouch and repair anyway.
---
Worried about some kids with their parents money, you should probably worry more about yourself and your ‚Äúadult‚Äù crybaby ways.
---
The Caesar legion had a powder that was coke too
---
Bethesda could technically borrow this for twitter - maybe tweet it at the fallout account?
---
and do you remember doing that? bringing up the scrap/store/replace menu?
---
sorry for the many questions but this has happened to me, 3 times. been trying to get to the root of it.
---
Where exactly
---
And sometimes left, because Bethesda. I've had more than one cussing fit because the row didn't start at the left most item, causing the "scroll right" default search behavior to fail in finding whatever I'm looking for.
---
Yes actually to store a letter as I ran out of steel and wasn‚Äôt leaving a unfinished word on my wall and it‚Äôs fine
---
Hmm, mine are loud enough. I have them set to be a little louder than my pipboy, so when I'm wandering the wastes I can hear the world radios better. Odd I know but for some reason that makes me happy lol
---
yeah right. no smoking while serial killing kids!
---
Mate ask anything you like, I fast travelled home, opened door, went to workbench, fixed item, tried to equip it from pip boy and it made the item equip noise but only drew fists. Tried again. (This time the little square to show my equipped items didn't even pop up to show it was equipped but still made the noise like I equipped it)  and then I tried to use my favourite bar. Nothing, the name was still there but I couldn't equip, then I fast travelled to watoga and it just went from my inventory entirely including my favourites bar like it was never there (and yeah the button to repair is the same as to drop)
---
Well there's that.
---
Omg that's adorable. I want a Mothman on my balcony.
---
What do you mean ? If you mean when it going to be available, it is already I got the plans yesterday from the free range event. It looks sweet as hell. Also got a few mods for it from the same event.
---
Also make it visible in power armor view and the quick boy.
---
Personally i kind of prefer the charm of one-on-one trading. It's more fun to haggle a price with someone, or cut them a break because they gave you a convincing sob story, or taking payment in ammo. An auction house is more efficient and convient, but i like having my own store.
---
Yeah it's on the same one as the stuff you get from the shop for Mothman poster, the sheepsquatch ate my brother poster, the college frat party poster.
---
I'm pretty confident that 0 of the people doing this are able to read your post.
---
I just started playing 76 3 days ago and every single player I have met has given me either a bag of plans, stims and other goodies. Loving the community spirit of this game!
---
I haven't found any yet. But the quest one with a 105mm lens, how do you zoom lol PS4
---
I went to the sugar Grove for springs screws and beer bottle then wv lumber and gathered supply's farming these place when I was readyhopped on survival Easy since the mutants are low level I just used a crappy pipegun and scrapped all there weapons
---
And honestly I wouldn't have wasted time and effort in making a ruse, I would not have given a rats rear end if it was any other item in my God damned inventory, but no, it had to be the one item I actually cared about.
---
There's a cool off time, so you just need to server hop and hit up the terminal inside the shack
---
This happens to me about 90% of the time in silos. Soon as I pop in I hear everything dying and exploding. I love around think someone else is there and nope just my very presence made them quit. They probably lost connection or something. But hey at least I don't have to deal with a few extra turrets and Mr gutsy. I wouldn't mind if this happened to the assaultrons though.
---
Man I must‚Äôve been out of the loop, 3 perk cards is a pretty small price to pay for 15% extra damage across the board
---
Sorry I‚Äôm kind of a noob what does cobalt flux and that stuff do exactly I launched my first nuke and picked a bunch of do I eat it or what
---
Hiding a quest and items behind rng is stupid and asinine. I could see making some stuff rare, but not so rare that most players never see it. In 200+ hours of play, I have yet to see X-01 calibrated shocks or the jet pack. Which limits me to either server hopping or paying crazy prices from people that either duped them or got extremely lucky. I don‚Äôt know who thought that would be a good game mechanic, but they should be shot. And I spent 400 caps and like 3 hours fast traveling today to try and find that damn camera, and never found it. Visited every location that I have seen people say it can be. That is not how it should be. That makes the game feel grindy and not fun.
---
You can switch to HUD mode by pushing the touch pad with the pipboy open on ps4, i don't know what the buttons for the other platforms are though.
---
Smoking is bad
---
This a hundred times and I actually agree with it. Smoking isn't cool, and I don't understand why people try to glorify it.
---
What you do is place a foundation on a slight hill. Place a mat half on the foundation and in the dirt. Then place the plant on the mat. If done right the plant should be floating. Next pick up the mat.
---
Ive been playing since beta.  I only have 1 character,  which I finally got up to lvl45 today.  I was using lvl25 excavator power armor as my only pa set. Farming mole miners to get enough black titanium to fix my pa or even get a higher lvl pa built is hard for me without my bf to back me up.  I dont do pvp either,  i have pasivist mode on all the time.  Basically the bf has been slackig on getting on and helping  me and most of my fo76 friends arent on as much anymore.  I did the encrypted event last night and that damn imposter sheepsquatch broke both my power armor legs. I only had 1black titanium in my stash.  I needed my power armor fixed to be able to farm more. I realized I was screwed, until I remembered about the repair kits.  Hopped into the atom shop bought 2 kits and fixed my power armor legs. Sometimes some of us dont have the materials to fix something and need that something fixed quick.  Sure it might be a small advantage but its also to help people who just want to play the game and have fun. I might be always broke bitch capswise but atleast I dont have to be a broke bitch with broke stuff all the time.  Lol.  This is just my take on this.
---
Seems like a lot of people are murdered every year though. Plus it‚Äôs a video game set in an apocalyptic wasteland, why shouldn‚Äôt I be allowed to smoke?
---
Wood and steel aren't rare at all. You're going to need a lot of steel for making ammo, though, so you should keep it anyway. 
---
Steel, lead, plastic, gears, springs, ballistic fiber, acid, aluminum
---
Wait, I'm sorry. It has happened to you 3 times? How many other people are reporting this issue?
---
That would be cool if you set it up in one of the little buildings on the whitespring golf course. ^_^
---
My friend has home pop up all the time, but lately he's just only stares at the enemies and does nothing
---
It's great because you can cripple them then multiple folks can tag them, all sharing the loot.
---
I've been through the burrows a  number of times, and at least 75% ended up having a  wall Walker, or a standing dead ghoul or scorched, could still be looted though, so I'm not complaining.
---
I‚Äôve only every smoked twice in my life, I‚Äôd just like the option for my character to smoke like a fucking chimney.
---
You can take the workshop at a nuclear power plant to activate a fusion core generating machine. They come out at 100%, just claim Monongah or Thunder Mountain since they're not taken as often as Poseidon. There are better uses for flux than fusion cores.
---
Cloth is a gunpowder component, but normally you don't collect it unless you need it imminently. Bone and glass are barely used. You can also dump all your spare ceramic.
---
Steel's really easy to acquire on demand. Just clear out some location with super mutants or scorched and scrap their guns with the Scrapper perk. Wood's pretty quick to farm by running around a forest with Woodchucker.
---
after two months of farmibg the messanger and guided meditation, i s have still yet to recieve my bos jumpsuit
---
Actually, let that go both ways, like ‚Äúthe voice of set‚Äù.

As I was levelling up, I had found guns WAY too early, and had to depart with them because I was 20+levels away. 
---
Now that I‚Äôm above, the last 10 levels (40-50) is the biggest problem.
---
You looking for a more pvp or pve oriented build?
---
I took a workshop earlier on PC, finished the initial defence, a random guy with Marsupial comes along and starts to claim the workshop. I wave and start to leave because I don't care enough to bother fighting over it, he whips out a TSE and kills me almost instantly. He takes the junk that I had from looting the workshop and then stops claiming the workshop.
---
I just don't get it. Why spend caps to start claiming a workshop, kill the person that had it and take some mostly useless junk and then leave? Both parties lose caps, no one gained anything good in the short term and I still had the workshop for the long term. It's like some people are so bored that they go out of their way to kill people minding their own business.
---
Again, if they actually took the workshop then it would have made sense but it's as if they only initiated the attack simply to annoy me and take what little junk I had.
---
Pve only
---
It was never billed as an endgame raid. It was billed as being balanced for mid-level players, about on par with the rest of Harper's, with the upcoming Vaults being endgame raids, and everyone on this sub conflated the two.
---
The part that annoys me about this shit is that they have the coding from Skyrim for intractable plot locations and planting.    It‚Äôs not impossible to edit it and create garden plot boxes
---
Yeah, most legendaries of any species will go through a ‚Äúmutation‚Äù once during a fight, in which they will restore all their health once it gets below a certain point.
---
L1
---
I get it mate. it's really aggravating when people call you out for "fearmongering" right after the game disappeared with one of your legendaries. wish I could help but I'm on PC.
---
so here's my theory. been going over reports dating back to release and most of them have one thing in common: the person pressed the drop key at some point (unsurprising, I know, since it's used for several actions) or sold something to a vendor. not only that, every other detail varies greatly.
---
which got me thinking it's sever (de)sync. say you open up a trade window and then close it with tab. on PC, that's the same key used to bring up the pipboy. except the server desyncs and doesn't see you opening up the trade window in the first place, all it sees is that you pressed tab. so the server thinks you have the pipboy open. but then you press R to reload, which is also the drop key, and whatever's highlighted is gone (items are always highlighted, even when the pipboy is not in use)
---
fast travel is an important checkpoint because, like in Fo4, the game saves and refreshes/resyncs your character on fast travel.
---
I'd bet due to how shotguns work that only the first pellet that hits will actually deal double damage.
---
It would be nice if it worked like how you're thinking and I hope it does too.
---
Yeah same here, bought all the plans and then went to go mod my armor that a friend gave me the crafted pieces and then I went through the miner miracles quest but, once it got to the crafting part it skipped that and just said register, so I registered it and the computer just says "Excavator power armor module blueprints downloaded to external data device" but when I back out it does nothing and I get no blueprints and can't craft anything. (On Xbox one X)
---
It was literally the next update after repair kits were announced that the daily challenges got dramatically more difficult. If you think that's a coincidence, then I feel sorry for you.
---
Once they pooled caps, adding the vendors was not a good move. One or the other would have been fine. Both is junky.
---
This challenge is 100% impossible to complete, do not bother.
---
I was able to trace back the challenge data in the ESM plugin, and the check for the Alien part of the challenge refers to the "AlienRace", which means the little green men. The Flatwoods Monster has his own, separate race record, and none of the AlienRace actors are placed anywhere in the world right now. No objects that resemble aliens will count - the only thing the game is looking for is an actor (NPC) record with the AlienRace.
---

---
I don't know whether or not it can be tamed, but just FYI, it's not new; I first heard about it back in January. It's just obscenely rare.
---
probably well over a hundred. someone consolidated dozens of reports in hopes that Bethesda would take notice (which didn't happen), I'm trying to find that particular post. I know I went through dozens myself.
---
the fact it happened 3 times to me makes me think it's also related to fps because I used to lock mine to 30. maybe it aggravates the server sync issue I just mentioned. or maybe it's just anecdotal evidence and the game hates me.
---
Ahh that explains it.  Thanks.
---
Tried to sell any type of item I had, weapons, apparel, aid, misc, junk, and none of them worked.
---
CHEEEEESE! FOR EVERYONE!!!
---
Tried that as well for about half an hour straight, and still nothing.
---
Thanks mate, means alot. Yeah I know people aren't gonna believe me and not meaning to be rude, frankly I dont mind. I know it sounds daft a person saying a God tier item just vanished but honestly, if it was with any other item I would've just shrugged it off and thought "meh" the only problem is now I cant recover from this, if it really has just gone, my entire build around that weapon is now null and void, the weapon I found, upgraded and made sure to keep on me has now just suddenly gone into smoke.
---
P.s sorry for ranting.
---
What console are you on? Would be easier to send screenshot but will write em once I get back on
---
This is skookum as frig.
---
right, so here's my theory. been going over reports dating back to release and most of them have one thing in common: the person pressed the drop key at some point (it's used for several different actions) or sold something to a vendor. not only that, every other detail varies greatly.
---
I tried for half an hour and it did nothing.
---
Let‚Äôs not put a feature like that in the atomic shop, but otherwise a strategic grind to earn a way to ‚Äúreforge‚Äù you weapons would be nice for the weapons we‚Äôve had since level 28-40 and kept into endgame
---
I did the outfit change on Xbox and it still didn't register. I've tried three times with different wise mothmans and it's never worked.
---
Jesus, well I'm sorry that it's happened to you too then, they said they keep track of items of every user, so hopefully if it keeps happening. They might have to do something about it (hopefully)
---
I'm on ps4. I can send a screenshot of what I have in the morning if need be... Was having connection issues so off for the night
---
Noooooo i dont game to flex....  good idea though.  Having different items in base 5o get bonuses
---
Go bloody
---
Damn :(
---
Damn they be nerfing it already
---
At 50% health my bloody 1* does 240 with only 1 of each rifleman perks
---
That's awesome.
---
I just logged off and was the only player at WS. Judging by the flora and mobs it was clearly recently nuked but the cloud was gone. 
---
Was chatting with a teammate back at base and counting down how many Legendary Glowies in a row I had killed and all were dropping weapons and armor 1-2*.
---
I‚Äôd say I killed more than 25 and easily 20 were legendary. I‚Äôve seen weird RNG surges when playing mostly alone like this but this is by far and away the greatest win streak I‚Äôve had at WS.
---
Not sure what the 8.5 patch did, but I like what I‚Äôm seeing.
---
Haha love the down votes, logic is triggering them so much
---
I've done that exact experiment, only instead of berry mentats, it was my unyielding armor set.  My int score did not change my experience.
---
I also love the details on their wings.
---
He's mocking all the tears about the useless repair kits.  You stated the only purpose of them, I did a queen earlier and used one from the same logic.
---
New issues ive noticed:  songs end about 3 seconds early.  And ive been dying much more frequently.  Not from anything crazy either.  A normal solo scorched killed me in like 3 hits, multiple times today.  Not an issue last week.  I know, maybe i should getgud.  Xb1
---
Can‚Äôt tonight, but tomorrow or most of next week, I‚Äôm pretty free.  Level 101, XB1, Trixie Roo.  Friend me and I‚Äôll Sherpa for you.
---
Still on there?
---
That ain‚Äôt no sheepsquatch that‚Äôs satan
---
I don't know if this is true I have seen him in the same spot at white springs a few times not far from my house
---
How do I get it?
---
Then it's just perfect. So let's bring on those basic paints for everything!
---
Unyileding armor and bloody weapons
---
Wait for radweed update. prepapre some extra space for your joint fuel
---
Even at 1* it's good. Use it until you get something better.
---
I do tag second after he spawn, so if some crazy godbuild guy wont kill him first. But then i let others to kill him.
---
Where do I get a bloodied lever action?
---
While they completely ignore the fact that some people cannot and do not play every day, so limited time items cannot be purchased nor the atoms with which to buy them.
---
They forget that some of us would just go through the atom shop and buy whatever we want.
---
Yeah! That would work great too. Bethesda fix this exploit asap!
---
Either drops or buy off Reddit market
---
I‚Äôm going to be chilling with zetans soon enough!
---
So I just got lvl 2 in Storm Chaser perk and the White Spring Nuke cloud gave me no extra HP gain -_- thanks for the bad info
---
Exactly haha
---
Coming next week???
---
Yeah i figured this was a custom job, I meant to ask what YOU did to it to make it near functioning. But thanks, I'll give this a look
---
Did you check if they also painted you a moustache? ;-)
---
I wonder if you could tame moth man he's already at your camp lol you can take a death claw and sloth why not a mouth man right.
---
A lot of selfish people play
---
Lol, I almost framed it that way, but it was only like 2 minutes of downtime.  Either way I am happy to be violated.
---
Thank you!
---
You can‚Äôt be seriousüòÇ
---
Ok so I am looking up and down all over my workshop page for these but eggs I collected and I don‚Äôt see them? What crafting tab are they in?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7wimxCcc8NURG9Em2bV7Ds/fallout-76-upcoming-double-xp-weekends
---
So if you hit some one with rads will it not work? I‚Äôve been wondering that
---
Yeah I'm definitely not getting double XP
---
While it may seem like it is working, AA does not work for energy weapons and bethesda has said they are looking into it.
---
You ever find anything about this?
---
This seems like the kind of thing that level 250+ ppl with TSE 50cals and too much time on their hands love to do
---
They are asking when it will be added to legendary loot tables. I haven't heard anything on that yet or heard of anyone getting one yet.
---
I believe it's a placeholder location somehow related to the nuke silos
---
This would be awesome. How would they deal with more and more ground being covered? Wouldn't larger building areas mean it'd just not spawn your clan camp more often than not? I guess public workshops are sort of like this, but I never see anyone treating them like a home-base for a group. Maybe some ppl do, and I just haven't seen them. xD
---
If your on PS4 I got a bloodied lever for sale wmcg204
---
Alright thanks üëç
---
It is listed in their "known issues thread". Says it will be fixed in an upcoming patch.
---
I read a similar thing, but that he used the strongest gun in your inventory that hasn't been favourited and that you needed at least one ammo for it.
---
Thx :)
---
Thanks for the offer but sadly I'm on PC
---
If you didn't loot it and have it it in your inventory you never had it
---
What does that even mean? I saw the furious tesla rifle for 0.1 seconds before the whole corpse disappeared
---
3 Per, 3 Agi, 1 Luck
---
Says you're offline
---
Roof of Poseidon Energy Plant, don't think that there is a level requirement might be wrong but it's easy to get.
---
This is actually a pretty nice idea.  I personally found a really nice spot to build at but wish I could in a larger area.  I really want to be able to build my own little town especially since one of our tasks is ‚Äúrebuilding America‚Äù.  I might not give others access to build, mostly because I have my own ideas for things, but other people may like doing community builds instead.
---
I have been seeing double numbers all weekend so far: WS ghouls are back to 400 something like months ago, lvl 91 deathclaws yield 1500, handing in technical data gives 1300-ish numbers. So at least for me, it's working as advertised.
---
I have already seen **two** perk card packs this weekend,,,
---
Was that from fallout 1 or 2? I vaguely remember something.
---
Which post? The one that says that it was scrapped before release? Or the one with the link to the wiki page? Or a third one?
---
They are worth any XP?
---
Problem solved. Any mutation chance?
---
I'm at a nuked WS now and getting less than 200 off every glowing one
---
It's really weird. Im not taking a single dad either.
---
Unless you looted it, and had it in your inventory, you never actually had it. Therefore they don't owe you anything. You never took possession of it.
---
I‚Äôm already over 1000 tho
---
Only thing we can hope for is the ability to reroll legendary stats. With the legendary vendor.
---
Recently 2 star Furious Deathclaw Gauntlet.  I've had a few random 3 stars, but for quality it's the DCG.
---
I never took possession of it because they took it before I had a chance to grab it, man you must be fun at parties
---
Huge complicated sculptures with pyro effects? Sure. 
---
A tray with soil in it? Nah. 
---
But; even worse is the asset being available!! It‚Äôs literally right there!! Frustrates me as much as those blue plastic boxes you can knock but not pick up.
---
Lol you're entitled.
---
Yeah entitled to my loot
---
Thankfully that hasn't happened to me, I wonder how many people near launch did though lol
---
Yeah, I was in a group off 4, and they were probably 6 or 8 more ppl around. But yeah I got 3 or 4 drop that I kept everything else was garbage
---
Found one at the lighthouse Gt is vin57cenzo
---
I play mostly solo and had a ridiculous RNG server at the burrows when it was nuked.  I got like 30 legendaries and I think 5 three stars.  Best I got was a quad radium rifle,  but to your point it seemed like a weird RNG surge.
---
Lmfao me last event just finished one 5 min ago where 3 tse pumps spammed the squatch before his name even appeared lmao. Still got the legendary but it was a 1 star Ghoul Slayers bladeüíï top tier loot only boys
---
Good for you.
---
Hasn't been born yet :(
---
Yeah, this was a month after launch and i had no idea that outfits rewarded from events had any value.
---
Used it for a couple of days then just forgot about it and then a while after i found somebody asking about it on Reddit and noticed people were not even sure it was in the game and that it was seriously rare :D
---
Never been more relieved then when i found it sitting in my stash.
---
And then bitch on here about buggy loot lists and shit drops.
---
No meele builds with sneak attack. They get insane multiplier.
---
Put it on, never take it off.  Problem solved.
---
It was never yours hahaha
---
Yes because bethesda stole it from me
---
Like 20k most people trade for good armor or other legacy instead so its hard to get a hold of
---
Yes, cap wise upward of 60k. Armor and weapon wise pretty much anything you want honestly
---
When they said they were opening the vaults I just assumed there would be people inside. Oh well
---
I feel the same way,  but more so with just a regular forge where I can make swords,  bows,  shields, etc... I'm not talking revolutionary sword or Chinese officer sword, I'm talking claymores and sabers.  Shields would be cool with one handed melee weapons too. Bows would fun and there could be many kinds of bows.
---
I think the enemies have been killed already. The game loads your local state (enemies alive, loot on the ground), then refreshes the data from the server. Sometimes this takes a lot of time so you can watch the loot vanish into thin air and the enemies die.
---
That's how i roll nowadays
---
Absolutely awesome, thank you!
---
The wiki one
---
You craft various Stable Flux at a chemistry bench. You'll also need High Radiation Fluid, Glowing Mass and Hardened Mass are also needed (you'll find those on mobs in nuke zones).   
---
Stable flux is a component of higher level underarmor, some power armor mods, some weapon mods and ultracite ammo, among other things.
---
You can by using rugs and empty whitespring pots.
---
I assume 'legacy weapons' comes from another game, sorry if I don't get the reference, but they would be the best possible rolls on given weapon I'd think.  What are considered 'legacy' grade weapons.  I have a TSE Pump weight redux and a TSE Gatling.  Would they be considered 'legacy' level?
---
Wow, seems like I lucked out. Just traded my TSE .50 cal for one.
---
No way really?
---
You can get the plans ar ferry port the normal way people go to get to the vendor but in the building before it's a straight line to the vendor
---
Quad is awesome if you run commando/automatic perks case the base automatic tesla only has 15 rounds.
---
I've heard that the vampire effect has a chance to proc of each mob a single shot hits so those are popular. Though I haven't tried it myself yet.
---
If they ever fix AA and energy weapons, AA might be a decent pick. However it is currently broken and they are "looking into it".
---
I have not tried furious cause I thought the arc would negate the furious effect since it hits additional mobs. Would love confirmation on if that works.
---
All the above though are primary effects which means you can't have them and 2 shot. But depending on your perks/play style you want want to try one of them.
---
For major effect if you use vats consider either +50% crit or +33% hit chance coupled with either -25% vats cost or +15% faster crit fill for minor effect.
---
If automatic you may want 25% fire rate for your major effect. Personally though I don't care for it on the semi-auto cause it already fires as fast as I can click anyway.
---
No. You dont get it. I've only gotten the fedora. Multiple times.  And the body disappears more often than not. Think I maybe looted it twice. Have done the event 8 times now.
---
The mat trick from Fallout 4 still works. 
---
Plant your plant outside. Place a mat next to it. Move the plant to the edge of the mat. Then pick up the mat and that should pick up the plant. Then place it indoors or wherever you want. 
---
This takes some number of tries to get right but it works.
---
I did just score the most legendary items I've ever picked up in one run. 37 total pieces of 1* junk lol
---
At least 200
---
I have a friend who can help but that is if he is on tomorrow and wants to
---
I‚Äôve done it about 20 times. I have about 8 fedoras and the rest are the other items. But here‚Äôs a hint that helped me with it yesterday. Use the camera. It shows where the imposter sheepsquatch‚Äôs body is. It helps!
---
Took me like 5 hops at the Giant Teapot.  The guy is on a picnic table right in front of you and is super obvious.   I tried a few other spots but didn't know where to look.  No way you miss him at the Giant Teapot.
---
Apparently explosive variants of energy weapons don‚Äôt drop anymore making them ‚Äúlegacy weapons‚Äù Things of the past.
---
somebody
---
You can make this by using a rug and put the plant with empty whitespring pots on them. With the rugs you can place them anywhere.
---
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sahlOICt5e0
---
~~P R O T E C T  A N D  S E R V E~~~
---
Legacy mean no more obtainable, as bethesda removed eplosive energy weapons from RNG tables.
---
Any energy explosive wep is legacy now.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sahlOICt5e0
---
How much?
---
You didn't own the workshop, that other player did
---
I was doing my hopping at the teapot after looking up a video. Believe me I tried for hours.
---
Sweet, I have a mutant slayers explosive laser rifle/pisol.   Was the first explosive I got and it broke after 40 shots.
---
Did you happen to own a workshop? If you didn't, they cant do damage.
---
I like how the vendor up at the top of the world says reminder to the gourmands    human flesh is not tradable form of good LUL
---
There are also many things you simply have to server hop, if you want even a small chance of finding them.
---
I've said it before and will be saying it in the future. BGS should have prevented server hopping to be needed and used from day one.
---
Yes you can play without it and yes I do use it. But that is not the point, as the problem is, it makes any chance encounters and content trivial as you can just server hop and eventually find it.
---
You want to do 5 SBQ events in a hour, server hop. You want to do the new Free Range event 5 times in a hour, server hop. It trivializes the content and rewards.
---
What exactly you want to do in survival? :D run around and kill people?
---
Yes and no. They're currently impossible to drop and only exist in variants that dropped before patch 5, but it seems like people are conveniently forgetting what the patch notes actually said:
---
&gt; Weapons: Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
&gt; Dev Note: The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don‚Äôt fire bullets, so we‚Äôve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.
---
They aren't in the game. They released the camera with only the 105mm lens mod you get from the quest
---
Not only works for all weapons, but I've read the damage bonus is applied AFTER your base damage is reduced by the targets armor etc. So since it isn't reduced by resists it is actually more than the 15% stated.
---
Pretty much, i just need somone to kill people with.
---
Because that's dumb lol no need.. I'm a smoker and would hate to see it in game.. it's pointless
---
At 7600 hours you should be getting 10 000 Atoms for sticking with the game.
---
How about little more tiered rewards. 76 hours = 100 Atoms, 760 hours = 1 000 Atoms, 7600 hours = 10 000 Atoms.
---
Yeah, same here. Im on Xbox but ive noticed since i got the game on day 1, they've never fixed it
---
3am bloodlust
---
mothman appears in random locations
---
in the woods was north of 76 was my first time .... I seen 2 red dots in the trees at night I went to see what it was probs lol 10 at that point, so new to the game) and he made an eerie noise and scared the shit out a me when he dissapeared
---
It could have been cool if, when you place this eggs in your camp, deathclaw attacks start becoming more frequent, like, a little event
---
Well its really not their problem if you don't check on the store everyday?
---
Having flash sales is normal in every store in every country around the world.
---
They are limited so you don't have time to just grind the atoms, they are a company and do this for profit.
---
They don't release the skins because players want them, they release them because people are willing to spend money on them.
---
Bethesda can't do jack shit with free atoms spent on paints
---
Good luck, but you won't find a more obvious spot if he's there.  Guess I got lucky.  Make sure you let your game fully load; I didn't see him until the rest of the world had loaded.
---
**Thank you** for this *inspiring* post, OP. I will now log back into 76 after *months* of waiting; seeing how it matures over time. üëçüèº
---
" it is a very shady practice on Bethesda's part "
---
Its basic business, nothing shady about it.
---
You don't want to check the store everyday? Well sucks for you.
---
Hope u find your moth, they can be a bastard to find
---
I'm looking at the real sheepsquatch right now
---
Free Range is my fave event for sure. That and One Violent Night are awesome
---
I'm pretty sure that's the barn door plan you can find in the game but that doesn't appear in your camp item menu.
---
People have said they should be in floor decoration, but I've haven't found mine either.
---
Uhm excuse me but whAt tHe fUck??
---
yeah let's hope so
---
Yeah I was. Thankfully someone commented on here they had it
---
I don't think so, there's too much random junk lying around. There is only one object that appears to be a footlocker on the ground. The dev room had shelves full of rows of loot and organized lines of footlockers in every room
---
Adrenal reaction can boost weapon damage at the cost of health. Its like a bloodied lite edition
---
Sick underflow
---
RNGesus blessed you.
---
Could have been, I hope it keeps going lol
---
ELI5
---
I ran it twice this evening and both times I had to solo it,  no one else showed up.
---
It is definitely somewhere, and it's not like when someone loots him he goes away. People server hopping for hours are doing it completely wrong and getting pissed when it doesn't work. 
---
I didn't necessarily server hop, but every time I logged in, I checked two known locations close to where I naturally was. This was probably 10+/- "server hops" via logging in normally. He was never there. Then I changed tactics, and just fast traveled to the know locations. Found it on the first try without hopping. He's always somewhere.
---
Reminds me of when I found out you could 'Inspect' legendaries to see the other perks...
---
It's not, it's in Toxic Valley. It's that glitchy event where you stand on an island in Grafton Lake killing mirelirks. If it's any consolation the other day when one of the challenges was to kill 5 radscorpions I got overexcited at seeing a radscporpion horde event. Got confused when kill number 5 did nothing so looked at challenges to see it had to be in Savage Divide. I was in Toxic Valley.
---
Your welcome after there kind deeds I just had to tell someone as they really put a smile on my Mrs face. Who was getting really annoyed with all the bugs, glitches and people being well Raiders.
---
I would rather see rooms in the Whitespring ‚Äúopened‚Äù to clans (after clans are implemented) and have them be an internal build space that the clan founder can assign build permissions in.
---
Dude you just blew my mind
---
Go to floor decor and scroll down to where the small death claw statue is. Then go left.
---
I'm sure I've dumped numerous sentinel and Cav gear over the past 6 months. I had no idea what it was. Just remembered thinking why would I want to stand to decrease damage when I'm always sneaking around. One of my most popular items I dumped at the station.
---
This may come as a shock, but June 2009 was almost ten years ago, not seven.
---
It is their problem that they are leaving money on the table.
---
Flash sales are not the same as items that disappear from the store.
---
Scroll down to the deathclaw statue then go left.
---
Going to make it my mission today, every time I've gone to a related location I've found the plastic pumpkin head, and the spawn locations with the witch, skeleton and vampire all include a holo tape reffering to the pumpkin House. It's a hit an miss but I'll keep the pumpkin farm a nosey and Fred's house for hints.
---
On top of the astronomy saterlite you can find the same consoles that are place on top of the claimable airport, which both look as if an object is missing on the left.
---
The alien gun spawns not so far from the crashed space station. Maybe something in between is missing.
---
Other than that, back to checking m. Greens files for hints.
---
If you bulk the steel, I'll give you 1.5k for all of it. ;)
---
https://youtu.be/febXtTmRM2U
---
Shoot it
---
Or if youre asking where to find one theres a new quest called free range which spawns one in the end
---
The shadow realm
---
I followed all what he did except I used a smaller actovator button (way smaller, the imgur album shows how small it is) and used a black buttonninstead of a red one. Keeps the design overal the same.
---
It would be cool if there was a way players could host a radio station.
---
Have customizable playlist with said amout of air time with real time hosts and whatever they produce.
---
I know I sold a lot of cavalier and sentinel armor to vendor early on because I thought those buffs sounded useless. Also the suit from mayor for a day, which I thought was just a regular world drop item.
---
I'm 100% certain your message has got across and everybody will stop this now..thanks for your informative input..
---
I picked up a lvl 50 sentinel piece from a vendor just a couple days ago for a couple hundred caps. Seeing a vended sentinel/cavalier piece several months ago is totally understandable, but finding that nowadays was like a miracle. :)
---

I must be dumb, what has that got to do with this post? Are you replying to another comment?
---
Sorry, I will only trade my bulk steel for an entire set of ASSASSINS CAVALIER SENTINEL BLOODIED EXPLOSIVE wooden armor. Thanks tho

This sub picks the stupidest hills to die on.

Many of use are still waiting on the blackbird paint to come back.

Yes it's a heavy weapon and will benefit from all related perks

I used an Anti-Armor Handmade that also does an additional 10% while aiming.  It kept throwing bone quills at me, but they did do much damage. My encounter was in the cranberry bog. At first I thought it was a glitch, but when it whacked me I marsupial my ass to a roof top.
---
If the nuke zones themselves are supposed to officially count as rad storms, then either the perk isn't working as intended or the change didn't properly go through. My comment was speculation on the exact wording for the perk in conjunction with the OP's post. 
---
If you're going to complain, create a post for the devs that their changes aren't properly working as they may just not be aware of the issue.
---
Maybe, I think 10 on each is acceptable, but 15 on each would help more with the perk cards.  
---
We shall see, they might allow this, at some point, hopefully.
---
Meant to say ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt‚Äù not did to much damage
---
Haha yeah I‚Äôm definitely with you. Killed a glowing gulper last 2X and was like ‚Äúwtf 750 exp‚Äù and killed one last night to yield something like 400? Something‚Äôs off this time round.
---
Baaaaaahhhhhd. Ass.
---
Lol. Dad jokes.
---
This is like hating on the player when you should be hating on the game.
---
Bethesda is the one that needs to fix this, not the one-shotters.
---
Unless the player is hacking/exploiting of course.
---
Because it costs caps.
---
Regular sheepsquatch doesn't.
---
That's my reason.
---
The video or the staff? The staff is bad ass.
---
Same here.
---
Total let down.
---
Im sure this post will help
---
Could be due to the artificial grass flooring, might have fooled the Mothman into thinking it was actually ground. Awesome screenshot though, well done you.
---
I'm always up for a terrible pun. XD
---
Gatling plasma is a heavy weapon, and if your talking about the armor pen perk + accuracy, it's under intelligence and it's called Stabilized.

Sorry for the quality. Took it with my phone

Good luck blaming the players.

---
I found a sheepsquatch near the National Radio Research Center, but it deepened before I could get help to kill it.
---
Agreed. 7600 is insane for anyone, I even IF you played for 76 hrs a week, that's 100 wks, or a fraction over two years!  760 is much more achievable.
---
Survival isn't scary. The people you see complaining here on reddit are not the majority.
---
Unless your CAMP is sitting in the middle of Whitespring, no one is going to come barreling through your front door guns blazing.
---
In fact, last time I was in survival, I got distracted and spent a good 3 hours building. I was on the map at the time and didn't even notice. I had one visitor. I waved, he waved, I showed him my base and the location inside where the Wedding Ring spawns. He gave me a thumbs up and dropped a bunch of aid, then said goodbye.
---
Not everyone on survival wants to gun down every other vault dweller, many are just as willing to holster the weapon and wave back.
---
When in survival, if your weapon is holstered, your name appears white. If it's out, you're red and hostile. I've literally never been bothered with my gun holstered and making my presence known.
---
I‚Äôm around 1170 hrs... still goin strong. So about that...
---
what about single moms?
---
3 weeks in after the game launched I picked up a hunter's explosive combat shotgun with movement speed while aiming it was something like fifty caps at the vendor
---
Perfect! Thank you! Didnt know that will try it out.
---
GD it. Fat fingered that one lol
---
Meant to say RAD...  Spent an hour in the nuke zone and didn't take any rads.
---
you can buy them from a vendor in whitesprings, a plan spawns on the bar on the top floor of the garrahan estate (usually rusty knuckles)
---
Technically everything in the game is owned by Bethesda even the Skins you buy with atoms are still owned by Bethesda nothing was stolen from you
---
Most can be found at the vendor in Whitesprings.
---
we are getting a cooler for our backpack, but camp versions are likely to be atom shop only
---
The floating crops I assumed would be fixed when moved over from f04 but sadly not
---
I imagine it stops us hording food and causing server issues with too many items. Also the with salt perk is the only option for reducing food spoilage rates
---
All hail Mothman
---
that's not rare that's non existent
---
What platform?  Probably 25k on PS4.
---
I have raised 27 levels on my alt in 8 hours.
---
At level 20ish I farmer over 40 fusion cores from poisodon in one session it was relatively fun (also got a bunch of uranium, lead, aluminium and concrete)
---
there is also a random event where a my hany is escorting 2 brahmin and a toxic sheepsquatch turns up for lunch

This post is fucking hilarious out of context. Seriously. Read this without thinking about FO76, it's hilarious.

---
Haven‚Äôt seen the backpack details, that will be good.
---
Yeah, seems like sth is off for you, then. It's been 12 hours since I've played, though, so maybe they changed parameters in the meantime? Will bei in the game in a few minutes to an hour from now, will report back.
---
I swear, sometimes I'll hear a molerat or a ghoul skittering around. I go to check, find nothing. As soon as I'm trying to pick a lock I found though it's like I expect to hear a, "No, those are my things!" as I'm instantly attacked.

I always see him on cliffs overlooking the cranberry bog, he seems to like the panoramic views.

I think everyone goes through those phases.

They‚Äôve stated multiple times that the only NPCs are actual players...
---
Hmm, you are PC player right?
---
Yes like the death claw it can be a random spawn but I think some locations are more hard coded then others like the death claw that spawns in white springs. I have seen the moth man in white springs same spot many times. So it's possible spawn % chance is random location not as much.
---
It is skin not paintjob.

There will be 3more of this skins for PA.

---
There is a camera challenge to take a picture of another player.
---
I've had the same thing happening since of last patch. Something that fixed a similar issue for me in the past was deleting cache / resetting the .ini config file.
---
Haven't tried out of lazyness tho.
---
The sheepsquatch thing was just a flag they flipped. There is unfortunately no spawn locations at all for any of the npcs labeled as aliens.
---
Vendors sell broken cameras that you can fix like the first one.
---
Same here! I was at watoga station on XB1, and a guy in power armour was taking photos of me with his camera. So I just stood there and posed for him
---
They update the files every week, they could easily activate it at any point. I don't think the bunker is the end of the easter egg. But I do think the alien blaster could place a large part
---
It's not temporary. There is no adjustment they can make that they already haven't.
---
Yeah, I also removed and put the outfit / hat back on. Didn't work either.
---
I had the asylum uniform weathered and asylum white hat.
---
He's joking about the scorchbeast being below level 5 and so he can't attack you because it's not enabled yet.
---
You can also get them from the vendor in Grafton.  The one in the building in town, not the train station.
---
I'm loving the weekend for leveling on an alt when I'm not working because I can get a level or two in even with just an hour or so. I've never really enjoyed the idea of leveling up my main to a level where I get all the cards I could ever want just to end up waiting until I keep leveling until I have the right amount of points to completely switch my build.
---
I like the thought of making different characters that have different jobs/capabilities since I can adapt to different playstyles. So, a double xp weekend seems actually nice to me until they give us a way to do a complete respec with the perks and levels we have.
---
It also gives me a way to level easier so I don't have to start some of the story missions until around 45-50 and can hopefully get rewards like the Somerset Special at a much higher level.
---
And now there‚Äôs a RadStorm here 
---
Best view ever !
---
Yeah was not like that at first nearly everytimr I played when the game came out I was ether killed by a crash server or a player with tse/ melee god. This was even at level 5. I had moments where I was at camp and got attacked for no reason it was quite depressing so I gave it a rest for a while. Glad it's getting better
---
Yes, 100% 
---
I think (and we all do)  the whole perk system needs to be re done with passive perks, like lock picking and what not, I dunno how many times I‚Äôve logged on and gone into battle not realising that the last thing I did when I was last on was crafting so I‚Äôve got all my crafting perks on!
---
Exactly that event
---
I am in-world (but left the site)
---
- Tourist is on top of LightHouse - easy to find
---
It's a glitch. The values of a stack are clearly stored as unsigned integers, and this is close to the maximum value for such a data type meaning at some point the value was adjusted past zero by mistake, no error correcting methods were in place to address it, and the game displays the erroneous value. 
---
Since unsigned integers cannot be negative, performing an arithmetic function that results in a negative outcome causes that negative value to be subtracted from the maximum value of the data type, resulting in an obscenely large number displayed for the stack.
---
How would anyone pay 60k when that's above the max carry limit?
---
I literally gave away one of these back in early February at a giveaway. It was a spare. Kinda regret it.
---
After 1300 hours I found my first ever Dense raider chest plan on a sloth corpse last week.
---
Rarest thing on the game would be the one of the fasnacht event masks as there is no confirmed photos of that certain mask being dropped during that event, I can‚Äôt remember what one it was though
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one. I've had a ton of graphical issues since the last update.
---
This happens at Sutton too if I recall correctly.
---
Thank you for the perk tips!
---
your friend should probably take some radaway.
---
Pretty sure those are some12 y old kids with TSE¬¥s
---
Try using a stimpak when your health bar is up against your rads. It will pop an error message saying you're already at full health.
---
OH MY GOD IS THAT WHAT CAUSES IT?! I‚Äôve been getting this constantly and thought bethesda just broke their game with the last patch. Running 2 2080Ti‚Äôs in SLI gets me ~350-400 fps in interiors and I can never move. 
---
I would never have guessed fps caused itü§Ø
---
Looks more like you laying steel eggs lol
---
Wait that dropped a suit aswell? What was that called?
---
Would be fun if it wasn‚Äôt fake.
---
My sister was helping me move items to an alt, sbq fight was going on so I went to kill it, she traveled to me and hit it a few times. She was level 2 and still got kill credit. It dropped some pretty shit legendaries for her and only levelled her up to level 3
---
His point is that he should have plenty of time to look and inspect everything in the loot pile. Bodies shouldn't disappear 0.2 seconds after killing it, you should have at least 5 minutes.
---
What's wrong with Rose?
---
Youre completely missing his point
---
I just got it to work for me with wise mothman. I had been wearing blue hat/white uniform. I did the event again with weathered hat+uniform so either only weathered works or you have to be wearing matching hat and uniform.
---
Yeah I know it's been happening constantly but it is just a bug it's not like bethesda's doing this on purpose
---
no ty, don‚Äôt wanna get bb gun legendaries along side wood armor.
---
LOL. Poor server, only half of him showed up.
---
No they don‚Äôt
---
From my experience that is the case with these pricks who spam the 1-shots.
---
I've always wondered if there is more to that RV with all the alien chalk drawings and binoculars pointed at a children's playground
---
No, it won't, correct. It's also the worst weapon to equip when you have a teammate with you tagging every enemy with a peashooter.
---
No I get it, I'm being a smartarse.
---
*HYPERVENTILATES*
---
You'd be surprised. I've found like 5  sentinel  pieces at vendors since the caps increase. lmao.  
---
Yes scrubs, keep selling your 3 star god rolls.  
---
Unyielding, 25 rad resist, 15% while standing still. I've got the right and left arm like that, both from vendors. rofl.
---
The jester, maybe?
---
That is a good point, it *would* be the perfect opportunity
---
Literally any mod for X-01 that you want. Have tried server hopping for Calibrated Shocks but got loads of unwanted Jet Packs pop up.
---
Decided to stop wearing X-01 and just wear T-51b since the plans are available.
---
A buddy of mine got what we think is a Gulper's(if i remember correctly) weapon that he can't equip. He says the cap value is something like-9,999,999,999 and has  a bunch of buggy information on it. I need to remember to ask him for a screen shot one day haha.
---
But doesn't that leave you with loads of rugs in your house? Or can you remove them without the plant going?
---
the mothman occasionally on his free time likes to appreciate Appalachias wild life.
---
Interesting about this is that the tesla rifle is not part of that list: it doesn't spit plasma, nor is it a laser weapon... But it doesn't cast bullets either, so it will have been nerfed just as well.
---
Happening on ps4 too man.
---
Yes you can. It's in the junk section.
---
What problem? Just use ur Explosiv Lazer lol
---
Serious offers only
---
I know they sell cameras but I meant no you can‚Äôt repair them, the ones we can repair are called ‚ÄòProSnap Deluxe‚Äô
---
Yeah I meant they sell broken pro snap deluxe cameras. My bad should've been more clear. But yeah you can repair those and get yourself a new camera.
---
it‚Äôs the sight kid
---
Nah I seen a video with that and the old man mask winter mask (Xbox) aswell as the sun (PS4) I think maybe it was the goblin, there was a photo PC but he/she came out and said it was from the dev room I‚Äôm pretty sure!
---
If you're implying this was faked, I assure you it is absolutely real! I have other recordings, even a few showing how these objects even bounce off a player sitting next to the power armor.
---
*TOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDD!!!*
---
Game is riddled with *Spawn Steals* and *Loot Stealing*
---
Then there is the various meta builds.
---
This game is far from fair (don't care for balance tbh)
---
Yeah, they weigh 0.1. Bethesda did 'em just like ESO, to the point I'm getting overloaded by them already.
---
 I‚Äôve never seen a vendor sell the deluxe one so I thought you meant the regular pro snap ones. Sorry
---
Depends on if he wants to be melee or gun, but either or, id say maxed out agility and endurance for starters. Anything to maximize stealth, sneak, and covert operative are a couple. In endurcance you want to maximize any non power armor perks and resistances. Ironclad, radiation, and natural resistances. (Not playing right now cant remember what all perks are) I know theres a few in luck as well. But also focus on leather armor as its quiet, and of course any chameleon armor you can find, the effects stack so the more armor peices you have the longer you can move in crouch before uncloaking.
---
I looked into that a while back and I believe it was perception rifle man,agility sneak attack harder to detect and luck for critical damage and vats perks. Just a thought. I'm sure some who has a sneak build has better input üëç
---
Only done this event once and it was level 50. Had some good people with me but it was fairly easy sadly.
---
Nah I seen that and the old man winter mask on Xbox, and I seen a video of the sun mask on YouTube, I think it may have been the goblin, the photo was on PC and I think he/she come out saying he went into the dev room and got it
---
It's just bullsh*t inflation beyond 25k. Both buyer and seller will have to go through several alts for the transaction. I don't really have a use for all those caps (except to spend them on even more serum recipes, but I don't really need more than a handful of those), and so I would only exchange my 3*-BE Minigun for another weapon (or several).
---
My vote is iron clad. I've got a sneak rifleman and I have 1 endurance and usually run skeleton good doggy or fire proof.
---
this is a pretty cool photo but
---
I got that before the last patch too
---
Handmade is probably the best all rounder rifle. Lever gives more damage but with the lower fire rate is more of a sniper rifle. If you want max damage go with a Gauss but the ammo for it is heavy.
---
Can't help as on ps4 but, if you head to Camden Park the vendor there has excavator calibrated shocked plans then either find/trade some violet flux. Then hey presto some calibrated legs.
---
I know you aren't going for rifleman but I dont think iron clad is super important once you get really good armor.
---
Future cosmetic items ...
---
We lost the technology ;)
---
But we are super strong at heating stuff (with nuke, for example)
---
I am currently saving for the plan. If you're not in a hurry and have the fluxes, I can craft you for free. But it may take 2 or 3 days.
---
I found mine after three hops at Point Pleasant, directly in front of the Mothman statue.
---
It makes a expec out of tat and ions?
---
I find that in alot of events now. Especially free range and uranium fever... Even had a dude smashing sons of Dane without consideration... Let everyone get a hit it guys come on!
---
I‚Äôve got the plans already but it‚Äôs managing to get all the resources around the same time to be able to craft them.  At the moment I‚Äôm lacking the nuke related stuff.  I struggle to keep the mats as my free stash is absolutely pathetic due to keeping the 2/3 * ledgendaries. üòÇüòÇ
---
The legendary vendor needs to get his ass in gear and get to Virginia ASAP.
---
I guess patience is a virtue so I‚Äôll have to wait üòÇ
---
Go stupid
---
I have a suppressed vicious lever action spare
---
I think his dad got killed up a free by the watoga police.
---
Ye just found out it is 2week old new content. And his dad is already dead. Shame, only lunch not dinner for me.
---
I would actually appreciate it if you could make one for me. I want to test it out.
---
If you're doing rifles you're going to want to max perception and agility. 
---
I'll see if I can post a link to my bloodied stealth commando build in a bit, but I've got maxed per, agl, and luck. 2 strength, 1 end, 3 Cha, 5 int.
---
Endurance is actually not as important, because if you do it right you'll almost never get hit, and you'll be giving up space for damage perks.
---
With this build, at 20% health, using a 1* bloodied handmade, I'm pushing 5.5k DPS. It's pretty crazy
---
Bloodied explosive laser rifle is kinda strong. Like extreme after buffing patch.
---
LOL yup, that sheepsquatch slaughtered our cows and it was only level 50!!! Snapped a pic with my handy dandy camera :D
---
Only other thing I can add is to nuke whitesprings get all of that stuff. Then use another nuke to get flux (I think a good place is aaronholt homestead (but no ghouls here so come prepped with materials)) then you can hit chem Station once you have enough.
---
Either way hope you get your calibrated legs. And that the purveyor moves his ass into apalachia üòÇüëç
---
They'd probably reduce your health or AP temporarily.
---
Well that's certainly worth 20 atoms.
---
Yup, love my Handmade. The plans to craft it are available in Watoga Station.
---
You can place plants on top of camp fires, so you can place them inside, but they will basically be on fire
---
No idea what sentinel or cav armor is... only wear PA... always see people looking for them but never noticed any such loot in 166 levels...
---
Whenever the corpse disappears look around for a meatpile  it's a pretty common occurence having corpses disappear faster than they should but they always leave meatpiles nearby.
---
More often than not you can find your item there.
---
The only moments when a corpse with loot disappears and leaves no meat pile behind is when someone else killed the mob, you just stumbled upon it and the game derps out, showing you the loot, even tho it's not yours. 
---
A few months ago there was this bug where if you lured a mob far enough and killed it the corpse will just vanish, haven't encountered it for a looong while tho.
---
Thanks!!
---
Patched suit. I thought it was just like the patched three piece suit but seems it's only from that quest.
---
Roughly the same thing I'm doing with my build, I wanna switch out some rifleman perks to increase my melee damage but also dont want to sacrifice the ability to use my handmade
---
I'd run one or the other dude, doing a rifle and a fist build 2gether will be v hard
---
Well done!  Great job!
---
Miner's Monument near Uncanny Caverns is where I found mine.
---
Cheers! I‚Äôll have to have a look then!
---
Yeah, I've seen variants of that a few times. It is possible to "pick up" the ranged attack some creatures make if you hit the interact button at the right split second. Almost impossible to do on purpose and most often happens by pure accident every now and then. Kinda cool though.
---
True, but you need both ranged and close quarters..at least I believe so..
---
Bows will be introduced in the next update
---
You're missing something.
---
Bloody mess rank 3 + 60% weapon damage boost + lever action rifle level 45+hardened receiver should be around 172damage.
---
the bit from above+Adrenal reaction at 50% HP = 219 damage.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
BUT, the thing is that it should already be enough to one/two-shot pretty much any regular mob.
---
I saw you got a gun lined up and I can help put most any mods on it if needed. Dam i know your pain as I lost a TSE dragon a while back. Then 2 days ago my friends quad explosive double barrel vanished from his stash. Don't know what is going on with items vanishing.
---
I really don't like to server hop. I'll do it if it's absolutely necessary but I'm not too picky on what I get. 
---
Just read about how to get Nuka Cola Quantum PA paint plan. NO THANK YOU. 
---
Find Keycard 1 and 2. Get a one-time code. Oh. And if TNT Dome Key 7 isn't there, server hop and re-locate that shit. 
---
Only reason right there if I ever server hopped.
---
They're not supposed to be in the game so no they won't get fixed. Just be happy they didn't remove them altogether.
---
Probably snek as well, even if I'm not detected and the enemy is targeting another player I can't snek attack, so I reccomend both using stealth.
---
Shotgun would work a little better for u
---
I just want a Mothman mask.
---
Pretty sure they all hit at the same time but you only get 1 increase in damage, not for each pellet. I've been using an instigating combat shotgun and it's brutal vs lvl 60+ghouls. Not much of an accomplishment but it works.
---
Given the incisor/martial artist effects of the claw, think I should drop 2-4 for shotgun perks?
---
Where do you even get the camera??
---
I'm usually able to tell if it's a rare outfit or not.
---
Camden park vendor, Responder vendor in Grafton and the Responder vendor in Whitesprings all have these mod plans.
---
That's almost a year. No one will even get that challenge done until next year around this time.
---
The building itself might not be player built with the camp tools, since it has that barn mark on it that many of the existing location farm have on their houses and farmhouses. More likely a camp built at a already in-game house.
---
That said, more variation on the building-sets are needed and large barn doors, variant windows and similar would be much welcome.
---
Craft a new one!!!!!
---
Really? Got one in my mule. I think I have to check it up
---
Vendor at WS had all the plans for the excavator
---
what is the difference between that and the drifter outfit?
---
Hitting him until you or he dies.
---
I'll outbid
---
Don't have social media :p
---
Did you just Fall. Out of Fallout76? LOL
---
Seeing the same on xbox for a while.
---
I hopped and fast traveled all my caps away. never found him/her. but I did find someone here on reddit who was at location and letting people join on him. I wish I would have looked sooner. do that!
---
What a hero.
---
Sure, I would most certainly help you. What mods are you looking for?
---
He/she  kills players in adventure mode because he/she  was tired of being killed over and over in Survival mode?
---
i want my irish drinking brawler to have a big fat cigar in his mouth
---
Thanks, I'll check it out
---
Only equip when crafting same with pick lock or hacking perks
---
I already did, should've mentioned oops
---
Level 1, you can find one on the roof of Poseidon energy plant
---
Why would I do that if I can just one shot everything and keep all the loot for myself /s
---
Witch hunting is not allowed here
---
Even Raiders can be mathematicians
---
Those boxes!!!
---
Sometimes it doesn't trigger a lege at all even if you take your time, also the longer you take to kill the sheep squash, the more people are needed to protect the cows from blood bugs!
---
I remember when I was a kid playing FO NV and my cousin asking me how I get away with playing a melee build so easily and take on death claws and the legion like their nothing more than scared housewives in underground parking garages. I‚Äôd simply load up on psycho and MedX then wale away with my sledgehammer. It was some of the most fun I had in a game. Almost had no relevance to the post but I sparked a memory
---
Thanks bud
---
I don't think you know what "smart" is
---
Yeah, getting this all the time now.
---
Not the plague rider skin, but for some reason I can apply the Bone Raider excavator skin to every left power armor arm, even though it should only be on the excavator set.  
---
Skins seem weird at the moment.
---
Which is why there should be Chinese servers and they are blocked from connecting to US servers.
---
I'd appreciate it if chameleon mode didn't change the ... idk saturation or something of the game every time I went invis.
---
Yep i encountered him there aswell, seems grahm follows the train tracks
---
Wait now you have also blue screens? Because I had bluescreens too these days on fallout 76 ....fucking HELL
---
Handmade Rifle is your go to for any scenario, your deus ex machina. For just a singular, raw, ridiculously powerful hit use a Dragon or Gauss Rifle.
---
I'm waiting to use my card until I have a team. 
---
Too many people who just chase an invincible sheepsquatch and don't act as conduits.
---
It's not a primary legendary prefix, you can only see if a piece is sent/cav by inspecting. One grants damage reduction while moving, the other grants damage reduction while standing still.
---
Thanks. Time to check all those 2* and 3* pieces I have stored.
---
That happened to me last year in December lol
---
Looks completely different.
---
Shotgun &amp; enforcer stops most anything then switch to whatever weapon you choose. Haven't tried it on a vertibot but have on cargobots.
---
Totaly agree, ive never gotten scamed, but i agree we need a safer way!
---
Danm thats cool
---
But they turned me into a duck.
---
Yeah, the mods can drop as plans from the Free Range event. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre obtainable from scrapping the staff but I could be wrong.
---
Cola Nut is already one of the strongest healing cards on the game. Though I guess I wouldn't say no to more drink based heals.
---
I liked the poisoned, neat they have the blood dripping.  
---
I'll build them but tbh, its too weird looking for me.
---
Can you share what the components &amp; no. needed?
---
Because portable backpack-fridges are coming in oatch 9
---
&gt;Be thankful that for now Bethesda has decided to stick to the later rather than the former.
---
I'm not going to thank them for anti consumer practices.
---
Release date?
---
Stumbled on this event on my alt with my other half. Spawned 2 level 80 3* legendary Sheepsquatch. 
---
I damn near pooped my pants. 
---
Nobody else showed up, and we both ended up disconnecting before we got one of them down. It was an odd day. 
---
I got a crook, though. Yay?
---
Are you referring to the rooms upstairs with the hand scanner? I just assumed they were accessible only after launching a nuke as I've still yet to launch my own nuke!
---
Oh what an excellent burn.
---
Sorry guy, I was probably one of those (no TSE though, just a shotgun and minigun) since I heard someone say a similar comment at the end after it was too late.  This was one where there were 2 that showed up and the cows died?
---
I joined as we were going up the hill and didn't know about the bug.  Maybe let people know and continuously repeat it before reaching the shack.
---
Joined another Free Range session earlier and there was a guy that was telling one person to do the ringing and the others should stop and focus on protecting.  Good coaching ...
---
To craft the basic staff between levels 10 and 50 you need 2 sheepsquatch horns, adhesive (6-12), steel (22-31), and wood (12-21).
---
Burning barbed mod requires 3 adhesive, 3 asbestos, 2 circuitry, 4 copper, and 4 steel.
---
Poisoned mod requires 5 acid, 3 adhesive, 4 copper, and 4 steel.
---
I used to have that coat. I remember I was doing some shitty event where you put ingredients into a hopper and fight robots, stopping occasionally to turn a valve or whatever.
---
Well if you got hit while transferring items to the hopper it forced your gear to unequip. Oh, and it also then put said gear at the top of the inventory list, the one that you're currently spamming the 'dump into the hopper' button on to complete the event.
---
Lost count of the amount of cool shit my friend and I lost doing that event. Because of course there was no way to get anything back from the hopper in the event a really cool item was forced into it. 
---
Hopefully they fixed that. Not played the game in ages and don't plan to ever come back to find out tbh.
---
It was a cool jacket though :D
---
I tried with many alts. The mire galleria never works,  abandoned bog town never works, and grafton dam also mever works.
---
That means 3 areas,3 challenges, 120 atoms.
---
And no in the beta i only played in flatwood.
---
Combat for many reasons
---
I thought it was just my crappy internet. Camps are not rendering until you get very close aswell.
---
Playing on Origional Xbox one.
---
I just did the burrows for the first time, I did it using my level 50 and I did it solo. Sure I have a level 106 too but my 50 doesn't have any bad ass weapons. Just an Assassins Grognak, a shotgun with enforcer 2, 2 troubleshooter armor pieces, 2 unyeilding, all 4 armor pieces are 1 star.
---
The old vendor trade screen from FO3 or 4 would work.  Mark your stuff and then you both have to confirm to proceed.  Seems like they way it should be ...
---
u/M-Carrollz
---
Just crafted up a storm over here. Got 62 stimpacks, 38 diluted and probably like 5 supers with your name on them.
---
Just going to grab some lunch, then I'll probably be on or near my ps4 for the remainder of the day.
---
PSN: Sinisphere
---
You're welcome to swing by and test if these servers are cross region.
---
5 violet flux per leg fyi. It took me a while to be honest.
---
If there were text chat you could just say "Tiananmen Square Massacre 1984" and they would be force exited from the game
---
It's true. Even down to the most essential thing: Your camp could not be placed...
---
Gauss also takes far too long to fire reasonably. Also thebarrels are broken, long barrel lowers the range and short barrel increases it.
---
I'd like to trade via cargobots. How cool would that be - seeing your newly bought weapon being delivered by a drone directly to your door? Just like Amazon :D
---
Theres a way to build a greenhouse with out foundation, involves a lot of switching walls but theres a post about a day ago about it. I set one up but with all the plants and the brahmin it ate my camp storage.
---
*are
---
Speaking duck? Oh would you like to company me, on my way to lord monthman, he took over my swamp.
---
I tend to wander after people and take pictures of them doing random shit, that is when I'm not causing trouble.
---
I think it's time they retire Bloodied effect. It's getting to a point where it's the single best build in the game. Best weapons cost more to repair, but that won't encourage people to use pipe weapons unless they roleplay.
---
I'd love to create a build around Energy Weapons, but there aren't many perks that benefit them (at least we have gauss).
---
I can understand not wanting to endorse real world vices, but it makes me wonder why alcohol gets a free pass. Hell, there's actually a perk that let's you *save* people with it! 
---
If I can go on an alcohol-fueld Mole Miner killing spree, at least let me have a cig after when I contemplate what I've done.
---
I disagree. I've got the camera on 4 toons with about 10 minutes server hopping each. Server hopped the light house during peak play hours. You can literally see the tourist from where you spawn in so you know immediately whether the camera is there or not and hop to save more time. With the way server loading has been recently you might give it a minute to load in though.
---
If anyone is curious, the camera at the light house spawns beside a blue crate and viewer thing as seen in [here.](https://i.imgur.com/6KTBqzQh.jpg) This spot is visible from where you load in after server hopping, it's on the left side of the light house from where you're facing.
---
No it won't, it just uses my stimpak anyway
---
I would've thought it would be possible to trade Atom Store items provided both players own the required skins? I could very well be wrong on that, don't have much experience trading.
---
Alcohol is more socially accepted that smoking
---
what
---
Permanent
---
I have this for a few weeks now. I thought that I fucked up something in .ini file. Also, in some locations ( mostly in Mire ) the shadows are pitch black. You cannot see anything.
---
If there is a legendary among a group of enemies I get a few hits on the legendary and try to kill the others first so when I drop it I can grab the legendary item asap.
---
Don't always succeed but works sometimes. Did it tonight and sure enough the body vanished soon after I looted it.
---
Oh God I just keep server hopping the minute it finishes, most of the time I just walk to the starting point and the event starts. And you'd be surprised, for me on PC I've had so many times I've done it solo.
---
Ah okay, well I'll guess I'll grind there. I just sorta avoided that place since it feels longer but also not all the enemies are above 50, and they all have a chance of spawning legendary. But wack, guess I'll try Freds BBQ shack more!
---
Its the fault of the Chinese?
---
exactly i think all in all they did a great job i understand its not easy to balance such an amount of perks and there will always be one single best build however the differences shouldnt be that clearly and if i already look on a certain weapon/type (energy for that matter) i just dont get how they thought the 20% boost would help out here i mean a single hour of testing would have made clear that even a unmodded piperifle outperforms a fully modded laserrifle its just a mess and having to rely on a very certain combination of legendary effects shouldnt be necessary imo
---
That happened to me in today lol
---
In addition to Grafton Steel, if you‚Äôre trying to farm for them look at these two spots as well:
---
1) Blackwater mine in the larger of the two utility sheds, laying on the barrel to the immediate left of the armor workbench. It‚Äôs a great static-spawn point for many armor plans besides just Combat.
---
2) this second location is a train car West of the Watoga train station. It‚Äôs in a cluster of 3 and the the only one with a an open door and a ramp on the side facing AWAY from the sidewalk which be advised, will almost always be patrolled by two Assaultrons. 
---
The plans will be on top of a tall barrel near the door, and are often glitched into the top of the barrel and hard to see. They will typically be Combat armor or BOS under armor but when they‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre Marine armor plans so still good stuff.
---
Good luck!
---
This sub in the nutshell. 
---
"I've never have this bug" "I've never gotten scammed"... BUT BETHESDA DO SOMETHING!!!
---
I can't even understand what OP is asking for.
---
Haha yep it's with me \*laughs in Instigating rolling pin\*
---
And wooooah 380?? I'm only like 239! Damn lots of respect for you! Such a high level!
---
Oh and don't think farming them is all easy XD I've gone through 2000 rounds of 5.56 and a good 4000 of Shotgun shells. For what it costs, it's probably worth it!
---
I'm playing on the same settings and get the same thing. Ultra 2560x1440. I'll screenshot it next I get it. Makes the world ugly as sin.
---
Patch 9 should be adding them back to vendors
---
I actually throw away my VAIL... no way to get that back... can no longer go into the mansion
---
Props to you. Gl
---
I keep finding BOS plans from Savage Divide treasure maps
---
Props! GL.
---
I have no idea how to sever jump (Athens whole fallout being online feels very new to me still haha) but I‚Äôm about to jump on.
---
Killed the SBQ three times last night. Her death got me close to 2k XP where the usual is like, 800
---
Op is asking for a trade window that doesn't have to income caps but multiple items
---
Lol considering the existence of the Enclave, there's a decent chance the Fallout Chinese were the 'good' guys and gals there.
---
&gt; Question to Bethesda: what the fuck?
---
They're are updating the server. Deal with it. This happened in every game, you got unlucky, move on.
---
Pretty sure I got mine doing the line in the sand event. NOW quests and events can drop the plan.
---
I like the idea, but maybe in an instanced ‚Äúvault‚Äù setting, where you have an underground vault area that only your ‚Äúclan‚Äù can access. That way you don‚Äôt run into sprawl problems and intersecting with other players.
---
Try and get a 1* instigating sniper for her.  Even though she‚Äôs melee she can still snipe a bit with it.
---
Then sell these items at the value it worths ffs. 
---
Where is the scam here?
---
It's been broke for months, same goes for the rest of the mire dailies.
---
\*stabs fellow downed player with beer\*
---
**D R I N K**
---
If ya do they are worth a ton right now.

Both of the above comments annoy me....i spent hours and hours getting those plans....now theyre going to sell them at vendors again. Blasphemy!!

I agree repair kits should not be in the atom shop at all but at the same time tho I think they are overall a nonissue and just makes people mad cause of fear mongering and supposed slippery slopes and Bethesda ‚Äúlies‚Äù to us stuff 
---
 I mean in warframe you can literally buy almost everything buy the weapons buy the gear buy the resources etc that game is super pay to win but people love it in fallout 76 you can just buy some repair kit which is worse then other repair options suddenly the whole game is pay to win and ruined?
---
I don‚Äôt think so but hey if people want to quit cause of this go ahead.
---
Wow man, you got the IQ of Einstein !! Not like every fuckin day someone is making the same post!
---
There are thousand ways to transfer items between your characters.
---
Oh, I might need to adjust my privacy settings, I'll try add you momentarily
---
Mothman is a very good boy. I hope he enjoys the view.
---
I lvl my medic drom lvl 11 to lvl 77 in 2 days so it works for me.
---
Ok :)
---
Happening on PC, as well. It is resolving itself within ten seconds or so and, for me, only happens when loading a zone.
---
Inherently there is no scam he would just like a trade window so he can trade more things at one time and have Bethesda hold his hand
---
Correction/clarification: there are two forks below (South) of Grafton Train Station and the random event occurs at the one closer to Twin Pines Cabins (which is a better fast-travel server-hop point in my opinion).
---
no need to be sarcastic i didnt know that
---
and a thousand ways seems unlikely as far as i am aware you can use a friend or someone from reddit to help you out any other ways i dont know of einstein?
---
"Bethesda, radio volume is too low"
---
* Bethesda increases the radio volume "
---
"Bethesda, how dare you? Radio volume is too loud!!!"
---
FFS, there is a setting in the game called World Radio. Increase the volume there and stop whining. 
---
If still not loud enough, decrease the other volume options.
---
"unusual sound like UFO / whatever like that"  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. good description mate
---
And Todd Howard wiping his ass too I guess.
---
I get to tag him but then someone blows him across the map so body is never found. Event ends and everyone is doing the confused, thumbs down and angry emotes. 
---
I really feel like bodies should stay where they die like meat piles. And you should be assigned loot for participating so every one doesnt get a heart-attack and blows everything up cause they‚Äôre afraid to not get loot. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Sound like flynh Buzzzzz ufo effect man xD
---
Its annoying sound too really
---
I did just that last night along with the hunters long coat. Then logged off went out for a cigarette then got on my phone and went on reddit only to see peoples posts on Wants and Have's for trade and sell. Oh well....
---
You mean like a humming sound and it's only with some types of weapon?
---
I can mod your legs out for free if you'd like
---
This does seem like something interesting to implement but has the possibility to be exploited by players (such as farming bobbleheads and magazines.)
---
[This fantasy is it?](https://youtu.be/_4l2Q23RXEo)
---
What the actual fuck!!??? Only by inspecting? What sick bastard thought that idea up? Omg.
---
They have them... just sometimes they just say 0... and if you wont you sell them anything try backing out of the menu and reopen it
---
Yeppp its annoying loud :/ any idea to get rid this audio glitch ?
---
That bug has existed since fallout 3 maybe longer lmao 
---
It‚Äôs hella frustrating
---
My handmade &amp; shotgun is fine . Only applied to hunting rifle &amp; lever
---
Unfortunately no.... I had same issue before and had to switch to a melee build because of it
---
Wrong game
---
It's because the gun is stuck in a constant aiming animation. Happens sometimes when you enter a building. To fix it, aim again.
---
I am going to be honest, I had no idea there even was a physical clock on the pip boy, I have always used the quick boy version.
---
It seem tied to ammo  . When i put my .45 &amp; 308 ammo to stash . The sound is gone. When i put back my ammo to inventory the humming sound is back
---
Unless they stealth fixed it they didn't do anything for energy. Tested a self crafted vrs my buddies anti armor, let him hit me a few times with both guns and there was 0 difference of damage
---
Gun
---
Xbox
---
Did you manage to get this trophy I need this to plat the game would be great if anyone could help my ID is nightwind11
---
I assume you were trying to click respawn at the nearest location, not the event hexagon itself?
---
Happens if you are over encumbered
---
It doesn't happen in every game, because you can rejoin, as I did, and get a server that's not rebooting.
---
When you block someone you keep logging back into the same server that the blocked player is on.
---
Don‚Äôt block people
---
While I haven't been griefed I have blocked players and notice the same thing
---
well yes of course there is a risk however you could make limitations like limit it to ressources weapons and armor for example however i dont think the risk of farming bobbleheads or magazines is to high as they cant be stacked anymore as far as i am aware. the bigger risk imo would be that there would almost certainly be ways of duping again but a good testing should prevent this from happening i guess
---
Of course! Our lord loves views of appalachia.
---
I've seen many guys like this in the past week. I guess they got destroyed on Survival and they decided to ruin camps in Adventure. 
---
Or they are just bored, who knows.
---
I wasn't encumbered, always in Excavator with calibrated shocks lol, and only option I got was the hexagon itself, nothing on the map except for that and my death marker.
---
Lololol you are getting downvotes for just saying the fucking truth. This community is garbage sometimes. So many people butthurt its a skin, they just couldn't READ.
---
At the end of wolfs in sheep‚Äôs clothing quest, you opened wolfs cache at the estate and got the recall keycard. It takes you to the pylons and you have to go to the terminal and activate it.
---
That is me, but I carry a Tesla for tagging stuff in group content.
---
Hmm, not sure sorry
---
Can reset by relogging...
---
Inconvenient, but it works
---
Yeah the bloody build is powerful but you can kill these guys easy with a few shots. You should try a gamma gun on then sometime
---
Not long now and hopefully Bethesda will make C.A.M.P.S invulnerable to attack and you can go about your business and not get your base destroyed :)
---
Oh yes. I have made quite a fortune by selling items that others trade on the vendors. From a Flamer that someone sold for probably 30 caps, I received 6k.
---
Vats crits builds are just as insane as bloodied
---
Yeah Bloody is powerful but they can be killed within a couple shots. Everything has a counter in this game. Try using a gamma gun on them
---
Bethesda didn't steal shit. You didn't pick it up. Cry about it, then get back to playing.
---
This is the best idea I‚Äôve read on this sub for months.
---
Don‚Äôt blame the gamers, blame the game design
---
I tried this too but the humming audio still there . But if put  all the ammo to the stash , the weird audio its gone . But if i take the ammo back again &amp; ready weapon  the weird sound is back
---
yeah i want to make a vats crit build for ages but cant find the motivation to do my 5th character 
---
guess i really need to start a luckbuild soon. any chance you have experience with energy weapons? would you go for rifleman or commando?
---
My power armor makes a random Robot noise every time I land from a long fall.
---
Yes actually this is two patches old. I've been surprised to see so few complaints about it here.
---
I would really love this feature, literally made a new character just so I could reply my lost unique items. But transferring them over to my main will be a problem.
---
A way of reducing abuse of the system could be, 100 pounds from a character per day. That way people not abusing it could still transfer and people who are get limited.
---
Yeah dw, I'm just more bummed that the bug has re-appeared in the game, though for me it seems to trigger when I'm inside of buildings. See I was doing a Robo brain horde event, it said it was inside of the AMS Corporate headquaters, went inside, went into the elevator, got killed before the enemies even loaded in! When they did load in, there was like tons of Gutsys and Robobrains swarmed around that one elevator entrance XD
---
Have you tried uninstalling then reinstalling.
---
Doesn't work for most high value items, because people are at max caps. That's why they ask for trades only. That's a high risk. People can just take the stuff and log out, no guarantee everyone get what was agreed.
---
Optimized bracers,targeting hud,kinetic servos,tesla coils, and an extra chest with core assembly.
---
Yep this same happening to me too this lately . Wonder if this tied power armor.
---
Really just a serious question but how do you get scammed in trading
---
I killed them all, not just the man but the woman and children too!
---
I have a tse Gatling plasma I renamed ear r*pe and a tse Gatling laser I renamed how to make yourself deaf because firing both. Of them glitches your audio with constant high pitched explosive noises
---
Did it once this morning and only 4 people showed up, I grenade spammed, 15 frags for the hell of it for the first bar and then we dropped it with guns.
---
If you don't use Caps people can bail the server after taking your items without completing the Trade. I think some people use 5000 Caps in Trades so at least if it happens there's still a little compensation.
---
I‚Äôd just like some mods for the one I carry around, it would seem more worth it if I could hit something with it
---
Seems like right, I've tried several things and read all the alien posts in this subreddits and that's the only conclusion that makes sense.
---
Yep. Graham (and Chally!!) follow a pretty regular path. I built my house along part of it.
---
I was honestly surprised when this wasn't the case when I Traded for the first time.
---
Dungeon in Bethesda games refers to any large-ish interior location with enemies, eg nuke silos, mines like belching Betty or blackwater, glassed cavern, power plants, etc. This is how they've always used the term for all the elder scrolls and fallout games.
---
Same here this does happen to me too today &amp; weird robot audio power armor audio when fall
---
Double the amount over the same time? Or Double the storage so you have to go back less to empty it?
---
I‚Äôm also wondering about this, I‚Äôm only a level 17 so I‚Äôm hoping I don‚Äôt only get the level 25 version. I‚Äôd rather wait till level 45 to use it
---
SAMEEEEE HEREEEEE . Thus audio glix makes me want to retired this game .
---
This happens to me alot.
---
Your making the right choice. T51b is better then the x01, with the small exception of the x01 helm having one exclusive Mod.
---
I think the patch notes stated some vendors now sell the ProSnap Deluxe cameras if you have repaired the first one.
---
There's no way to change pipboy color, no idea why. I always had mine set to grey like an old CRT
---
Yeah I get that buzzing sound when I use a harpoon gun, but what I think is worse that every time I jump high and crash down in PA, I hear a faint sheepsquatch noise! It's driving me nuts!
---
I currently have a similar gauntlet and i went all in on that. Just using your handmade standard should be fine to get things close to you so the heavy work can be done.
---
That happened to me 5 seconds ago
---
Still bugged. They haven't fixed these. I don't think that they even care anymore.
---
Also the sacrificial blade adds a star. So if you find a 3 star legendary machete, and add the mod, you get a 4 star legendary weapon.
---
You have to reply to a person's comment. Just looks like you're talking to yourself.
---
I've put 2 thirtysomethings past 50 and a 3rd i just behind them. Also one of my higher levels was getting around 1200 xp for level 80 scorchbeasts. It's been a grand old weekend.
---
Better idea! Quack doctor should make you "think" alcohol cure you it will show your health go up and everything but then it actually does nothing and watch as you get one shotted by a radroach because you only "actually" had 10 ho
---
Downvote because you said "/s"
---
Honestly either one would work, I mean for example only getting 10 ores or 10 acid etc. I just feel if you build a camp around a extractor you should get say 20 over the same amount of time or increase the storage so it just builds up over time like set the limit to like 50 as the max
---
I just do it on my own, is easy enough. Tired of the same thing.
---
It‚Äôs hard right now to main a pistol. Hopefully vendor rerolling these in the future will allow them to be a viable main weapon. A buddy of mine has an aae 10mm that is pretty good, but he burns through ammo when not sneaking.... and the gun breaks way to fast.
---
YES 100% this issue same goes to my main characters . Put all ammo to stash the sound is gone &amp; put it back again the annoying sound is back
---
Really? i didn't know all of them were broken, damn.
---
Everyone gets the loot. The same loot. You don't get less. And XP.
---
I've never upvoted anything faster than this post. Nice dude!
---
Yeah I can see 10mm burning fast which is why most prefer Westerns. I'm hoping the vendors help too
---
North West of map, just below Hemlock Holes.
---
In lake bed just south of Charlston station.
---
thanks im still fairly new to reddit still getting used to it
---
You can do this with campfires! Although the crops are basically burning
---
Someone else in here already pointed out RDR2 isn't sold in Saudis Arabia while fo76 is, which is a country with laws against smoking.
---
That would be great but I rather be able to mod them myself in case I lose them but thank you so much anyway!
---
Cyka blyat rush sheepsquatch
---
My current character is level 89 and my friend who was level 25 joined the event for the first time. I told him to focus on the herding and pet me and this random level 280 get the enemies. It works well because nobody has to worry about multitasking.
---
Np man
---
Yeah dont worry about it I was / still am a total noob it seems like they just had chameleon armor
---
If its bragging rights, Ill kindly have you know I have 150+
---
Na I've got like 200 or so on me and never use them
---
I've come across Sheepsquatch just wondering around with nobody near them.  I also found one where a low-ish level guy was fighting one and he thanked me for helping me kill it.  
---
I have not seen what you're talking about, but I understand and agree regardless because I do see that for the previous new event with the radio towers - I don't even know what happens because I've never managed to get there before everything is already dead.  
---
On the flipside of things, it's just as upsetting when 3 - 4 of you go to try to kill the Scorchbeast Queen and have to give up because she's so tanky and even your best rifles seem to be Nerfed so hard that they barely seem to to any damage to her.
---
Dear Bethesda i hope you read this post &amp; fix this Audio Glitch problem . This happen to me with my Harpoon &amp; Lever too buddy :/
---
It happens to me, not just in the distance. When I load in sometimes the ground around me looks like this until I move my character. The second I move her, the lights/colors load in.
---
It could work but it would trigger slowly and not all the time, I‚Äôve hooked them to everything and they all have a lag before triggering
---
You're missing the point this p2w because you literally never have to uncroch at anytime in survival. It is obvious you don't know what you are talking about if you think it isn't p2w, as even the newer meta in survival literally requires them now.
---
Also you are wrong about most sticking with survival, go read any other posts on this subreddit. They all literally whining about all the people quitting survival and going back to pvping in adventure mode.
---
Found the racist
---
Because neithef kf those games have or are currently sold in Saudis Arabia , while fo76 is. SA has laws against displaying smoking.

When I trade gear for gear, I make sure to trade caps as a security deposit type of thing. For example, if I'm trading my sentinel armor for your bloodied power fist, I give you my armor for say 3000 caps, then I buy your power fist for 3000 caps.
---
Yall make me jealous I like doing them and have a hard time finding any at all smh.
---
I've seen guys run the explosives perk with legendary heavyguns with the explosive effect to devastating effect
---
On pc? If yes use the keyboard (enter/space). Mouse is abit messed up at the menus.

Someone already pointrd out that neither rdr2 or gta v are sold in Saudi Arabia, while fo76 is being sold there. Which they have laws strictly prohibiting the depiction of smoking.
---
100 here.
---
I never accept requests from something I haven't setup beforehand.  At this point I'm only looking for very specific things and letting some rando look through everything I have on me is just stupid.  I love it when people get angry because I won't let them look at my stuff.  That's why we need a "Thanks, but no thanks" emoticon.

---
Hey messenger gave the stimpack recipe to one of my characters three times
---
A pain worst than being a scorched :,(
---
I leave them in the oveseers box at the camp or in flatsprings for noobs.. havent used one in ages...
---
On one hand, yes, the extreme high damage one can get with the right combination of perks + weapons + stats + chems + mutations, etc. can be game breaking and really is a flaw in the game design.
---
But, on the other hand, it's nice when you can play on a server without the douchebags who think it's fun/funny to be nasty to other players who don't want to deal with that kind of behavior.  
---
I play Urban Terror a lot, in that game if you kill your team mates too many times you get kicked from the server automatically.  Perhaps it should be an option for players to join "coop specific" servers.
---
This game should definitely NOT be balanced around PvP, because that is such a small part of the game. For everything other than PvP, bloodied unyielding nerd rage serendipity is by far the strongest build type.
---
The event is 'Feed the People' and they did fix it. You can only put the ingredients in it now.
---
Did it let you build up where I'm at? Or has the new raider camp moved too close to the spot?
---
What bone raider armor? What did I miss?!
---
Bloody mess is great if you have a few special points to spare, but not essential.
---
You‚Äôre right, the server warning system in place is inadequate when certain activities in the game cost currency/time more than 15 minutes to complete.  (NOT talking to you solo runners who can clear a solo and launch in sub 8 minutes)...
---
I've seen this on Instagram today  I recognized it because of the silver markings that look like scratched paint it looks  awesome!
---
What lvl are you? This happened to me yesterday but I figured it was because I was only lvl 28
---
North east of Grafton in the toxic golf course is a flat woods monster that is static and server hopping for grafton day will start ‚Äúgrafton day‚Äù about half the time.
---
I got got an anti armor 50 cal :O it's my first legendary 50 cal with it and stabilized I hurt things that shouldn't hurt
---
Afraid so. On my higher levels chars I've done 1 mire daily in at least 3 months. Something's preventing them from starting. I reckon it's got something to do with the wendigo/clown glitch as that's a mire quest. Could be wrong aa it's not a daily.
---
Digging the pic!
---
drink an inert flux and just eat it.
---
Tried all of that, space, enter, mouse and all, and couldn't do anything. Tried leaving the map bit and maybe just let it load a bit more, opened it again and still nothing :/
---
Try scrolling left or right when you select it... smh
---
NeedSomeMilk you post the most weird and disturbing shit.
---
This is how cults start, I'm fairly competent.
---
*laughs in hoarder* I keep a minimum of 150 I currently have 600 adhesive
---
I have very little room for my guns though :,( so I can only hold a few
---
Please help I have a problem
---
I've actually had more time to test the theory with a friend. 
---
My normal DR is 336, while reloading a single round of the pump action my DR goes up to 589, then my DR drops back down for a moment when I cancel the reload cycle by firing, then the next round reloads which puts the DR back up again until the cycle finishes. I can get all of this to happen within 3-4 seconds while staggering a single round reload and fire cycle, and my DR is +250 for about 50% of that time. 
---
I didn't notice any persistence of the effect once the reload cycle finished. I let all 8 rounds reload without firing and once it finished the effect went away, and I couldn't manage to cancel the cycle without firing the first round loaded so I couldn't test it that way. No sneaking was used, and I didn't really consider that damage was somehow effecting it as I was just shooting air during testing. I think I'll need more of an explanation on that one. 
---
Really it seems just as simple as "your DR is +250 during how ever many seconds it takes for your weapon to reload". 
---
I wish had a few more more weapons with the effect so I could test whether the animation makes a difference. For instance, reloading 8 rounds of a pump action versus 1 round of a black powder rifle. With a black powder rifle the reload actually happens before the animation finishes, and you can even cancel out the animation after a second or so by switching to another weapon and back, so does the effect persist thru the entire animation, or just the reload cycle?
---
Also whether or not staggering the reload cycle works on a lever action rifle as well. I would assume so since it uses the same mechanics as a pump action for reloading one round at a time.
---
I‚Äôve tried sending suggestion tickets to Bethesda about this, I think it‚Äôs a great idea
---
Engine wasn't every built for multiplayer I'd probay why.
---
&gt;hit the head
---
Is this a euphemism for masturbation? I hope you left your mic on üòâ
---
Are you inquiring about the road house Raiders? We don't normally call ourselves a cult but it works ;)
---
I have 450 of them never used one of them.
---
Thank you!!
---
Same here. Mine is the medical helmet. I got it some time during beta. Haven't ran into anyone else with it yet. That combined with the engineers uniform looks pretty dope. üôÇ
---
It's happening already!!
---
I have an area similar to that with musical instruments around a camp fire just above black water mine.  So nice!  Makes me want to log in now :-)
---
Thats the Grafton Monster - static spawn also twice in Charleston.
---
The Flatwoods Monster hasn't a static point but best Area might be Server hop at Abbie's Bunker.
---
I have given bragging rights in the form of an upvote to all who have more than me! Some of you guys have a ton!
---
I don't understand why they didn't port over a lot of things from FO4 (that's not true, I get why they did it, just seems like a poor choice).
---
I killed my first one yesterday to mine was in the wild what console do you play on?
---
I say increase the storage of all extractors
---
I'm on PC üòÅ
---
Yep, I read that with the wrong side of my brain today haha üòÜ
---
Yes this same happen to me too today m8 . No idea how to fix this .
---
I'm getting it a lot whenever i teleport to my camp.
---
It seems to occur the most in the savage divide.
---
..just to be clear, have you tried loading it up without those peripherals, and verified it works normally with m&amp;k?
---
Do you have buzz brain? It‚Äôs a disease
---
Dang I was thinking you were the one that carried me though the fight.
---

Where does this event spawn? I didn‚Äôt know there was another outside of the event cryptid in ash heap.
---
That‚Äôs mad annoying
---
Ironically I was helping to lower lvl players who were doing the Brahmin event. Then the sheepsquatch rocked up, they would have struggled. Hell I struggled to hurt the thing and that was with explosive bullets on a weapon
---
don't worry, that's just water weight from sweating in the power armor..go hydrate and you'll be good as new :)
---
Name all 1000 Einstein
---
Oh, I dumped many of thems.
---
The problem with that is when you're yourself have close to 25k caps. Would you use junk/ammo as collateral then?
---
As a junkies build i would love this. I keep like 10 beers on me at a time.
---
First off, you only get one shot at your first time.  Take your time.  Do events on the map, explore everything!  Despite mob levels, with the right point allocation you can kill just about anything at any level.  Melee is incredibly strong for new players. Get a fire axe and go to town.  Also, the game is more stable but still a buggy mess.  Expect glitches, crashes, quests that won‚Äôt complete, etc.  And just have FUN!
---
If you want to uninstall, then uninstall. It's your decision. This isn't a support group.
---
I REALLY hope they add this! its the most immersive way to fast travel in Fallout 4 and nothing was quite as badass as arriving in a Vertibird.
---
I mean there's a perfectly good Vertibird in Watoga, But I fear they will use that to fast travel us to another map.
---
I sense confliction in your reply.
---
I‚Äôm merely asking for positive thoughts on the improvement of this game.
---
This is in boundaries with the terms and conditions of this subreddit.
---
So I suggest you reconsider your reply.
---
Purple realm?
---
Ikr . I have no idea how this happen to me today . Yesterday nonissues like this :/
---
Well, I can use my m&amp;k when it asks me to press any button to start, and I have reloaded the game after unplugging all my other devices to make sure, but still nothing.
---
No, but I did do a scan and repair since I am using the Bethesda Launcher for FO 76.
---
Hawt tip! have an upvote!
---
Nope.  Just that it's stupid to ask us to convince you to stay in a game you have issues with.  Just... Play something else.  Go away.
---
I had a similar experience when attempting to log back into Tera after a long break.  It was a fun game for a time but for some reason would not function on my machine in the latest updates.  If you can get FO76 to work on your system, it‚Äôs a phenomenal game with probably the most immersive, dimensional gameplay I‚Äôve experienced.  Definitely worth a try.
---
If you put a beam splitter mod on an explosive laser pistol it does insane damage.
---
Downside it breaks really fast. And they don't exist in dropped loot anymore(explosive energy weapons were removed from drops in the tse nerf patch) so unless you had one stored they are impossible to get.
---
Oh good, it's not something weird on my end!
---
I think I won‚Äôt, but thanks.
---
Tomacco
---
Changing accounts won‚Äôt help your cause,  your missions is tedious and not worth the time and effort expended.
---
yeah i have a beamsplitter on my furious explosive ultracite rifle :D
---
Only because it doesnt create an acrid smell. If it did, we'd be seeing the same backlash towards it and everyone who chooses to partake of it.
---
Gunslinger works well with a pipe revolver, as it benefits from both rifleman and all pistol based perks. My pipe revolver would do 120+ damage vs my 108+ western revolver. There's no legendary drops for the pipe revolver, but it's still a cheap and light beast.
---
If it takes more than an hour to complete a silo, you probably need to spend more time grinding and getting to a higher level.
---
ew a racist. pretty sure by read, they mean the chance of stumbling on the post, not a racist remark.
---
seems like a logical next step for Beth. I'm sure there's money to be made off of raider types who'd love to have a few heads on spikes decorating the camp perimeter
---
No, no, I went down the manhole to get to the Burrows. That's what loaded for me instead of the actual place. It was so weird.
---
It‚Äôs all about those moments my dude!  Feels good!!!
---
YES. I can't tell you how many ghoul or mongrel events have ended the moment i load in, usually super mutants get them.
---
Exactly, just start and enjoy the ride. Once you‚Äôre leveling up you‚Äôll constantly bump in to problems to solve. Maybe you need to find some plans, need plants to make adhesive or need mods for your weapons. Just figure it out and if you think you need help, look it up on reddit or youtube. Knowing all the answers before starting kinda spoils it.
---
As there is no endgame to rush for yet, I'd also recommend taking your sweet time exploring the world, reading every note and listening to every holotape. This game is rich in lore, but only if you're paying attention.
---
I was lucky i kept a junkies explosive +10% while aiming laser pistol in my storage.
---
According to Liberty Prime, yeah.
---
I'm at about 80. Haven't used one since the Beta with my brother!
---
YUP THATS WHAT IT ALL LOOKED LIKE except it was bright yellow like in the pics and everything was laggy. My head hurt..
---
What level, I wouldn‚Äôt mind grabbing that aswell.
---
Or what about spending caps to travel to the event, only to find out you have to search 4 different areas to find the horde (spending even more caps in the process).
---
What a grind! You go!
---
I use them if I'm bored and already near a radio tower. They're fairly worthless, but I always enjoy the random weapon to scrap and learn a mod, knowing fully well I'll never use a laser rifle/ .44
---
Our lord has plans for you.
---
Do not worry, he‚Äôs here to give you his divine wisdom!
---
...or you ate his eggs. And he‚Äôs here for your death to balance out nature.
---
yeah mine was luck too and before the patch it was braking in like two magazines so i nearly sold it to a vendor im glad i kept it though
---
Why exactly? This post is just explaining your situation, I could kind of understand the mega sloth from fasnacht but not the one star level 80 sheepsquatch. It‚Äôs almost never above one star so everything you get is most likely going to be trash. All the ‚Äúhigh levels‚Äù with high damage weapons are actually doing you a favor because without that kind of gear the sheepsquatch would be incredibly hard to keep off the cows. So stop your whining and get back to killing those bloatflies.
---
Would love to be able to swap 100 of those for a better version that would call a drop containing at least 1 legendary weapon/armour. As they are now - not worth the trouble.
---
Its rarity is the only attractive thing about it tbh. Looks like a bad drifters outfit
---
America will never fall to communist invasion
---
If you want to try and avoid that, before traveling, keep opening your map.  If the marker for the Event moves slightly from one look to the next, it's an individual enemy.  If it remains fixed, it's going to be the searching thing.
---
Do "Mistress of Mystery" quest line. Thank me later :D
---
Oof. Where would it be around abbies bunker?
---
The pipe revolver is the best pistol in the game, barring legendaries. It benefits from both rifleman and gunslinger. My pistol only build, my lvl 40 pipe revolver outclassed my legendary western revolver by about 20+ points of damage, with cheap ammo and cheaper repairs. There's no legendary pipe revolver drops though, that I know of anyway.
---
Step 1 is really ‚ÄúGo to Dome 7 and see if it‚Äôs open,‚Äù because if someone else on that server has already gotten that plan and it‚Äôs had time to respawn, you can waltz in the open door and just take it.
---
Be aware that the server lags too
---
I saw someone complaining about this once in game, he started to mad (he was insulting and so on, because, you know, this guy knew everything and was right on the internet ;) ), but from my own view the Sheepquash was out and mutated, and was about to attack the cows.
---
Just do not killing it too fast is enough (at least before he start to kill the cow): just make sure everyone around has the tag.
---
i quite liked the pipe revolver too however isnt it a mayor drawback that it cant drop as a legendary as far as i know?
---
You should get the Science Scribe outfit, it‚Äôs the matching part of the set :)
---
What exactly is the problem you were trying to articulate? People suck?
---
On the top of the hill is the only place there I‚Äôve seen it.
---
Imo that's lucky, it's much easier than the Imposter but still a fun challenge when you're on your own. Very anticlimactic when it dies within 10 seconds
---
Wait what...
---
I just got a great shot of that one last night.  Had to solo the whole thing, almost didn't' make it, the monster spawn was so slow.   I take it interacting with him doesn't give me a buff, despite what it says?
---
\^ good tip
---
Instead of trying to group, send friend requests instead.  If you have a friend on the server, you'll be able to rejoin the game through them.
---
Some players have legitimate reasons not to group.  They don't trust anons not to go and destroy their CAMP.  They run perks like Lone Wanderer.  They might be running Workshops.  There's good reason to not accept every group invite you see.
---
Hahaha when that happens to me it also makes me nude (well undies nude), so it's even more horrifying. Hasn't done it in several updates tho!
---
Explosive effect is only a 20% damage increase, but yes the sheepsquatch is the tankiest enemy in the game its healthbar is only preceded by the imposter sheepsquatch and the queen but ofc those 2 are bosses
---
Oh lol. Thanks!
---
You only have to search when an npc has a specific spawn in that area of the map. Say if there‚Äôs a protectron horde in the mire. There‚Äôs no normal spawn for protectrons in the mire so it would spawn right at the event but if it was in Forest or cranberry bog you‚Äôd have to search for them as they have set spawns in those areas.  Hopefully this makes sense I just woke up üòÇ
---
Yes and no. It sucks it can't be cooler, but the extra base damage and plentiful ammo more than makes up for it. 44 ammo is fairly scarce at lower levels, whereas the pipe revolver you can start to tank out almost immediately. I had an instigating VATS critical western revolver that almost never got used, because the pipe revolver did +20 damage per round, even though the western was a "better" weapon.
---
My bloodied Tesla with 50 crit damages and reduced carry weight simply destroys 95% of my foes, pve and pvp enemies alike.
---
I have a TSE handmade and I feel more confident carrying my bloodied Tesla into battle 9/10 times. 
---
If energy weapons receive another buff I won‚Äôt be complaining but if I feel boarderline OP now...
---
I just want to stil see the RDS when in Chameleon mode
---
Can't tell you how many legendaries I sold or Tesla rifles I scrapped back in the 400 storage space days. It's painful to think about.
---
^^
---
"Vengeful Mothman" is hostile. 
---
There's an event where you can summon "Wise Mothman" and he's friednly.  Interacting with him will get you an XP buff.
---
Yeah lol. I ditched my gunsmith for the durability effect and now I'm chugging ballistic booze every queen fight
---
Yes, he uses the tunnel to cut past the Savage Divide on the south end.
---
It's actually a really good option for a player who doesn't fast travel because you traverse an enormous distance in the overworld just by traveling down a relatively short tunnel.
---
"I am Vengeance!  I am the Night!  I  AM.  MOTHMAN!"
---
I‚Äôve been having a similar issues with mine. I try to deploy it and it doesnt come up right away it spawns in a different spot than I placed it.

---
Scroll down to the backpacks section for the refrigerator mention. Top of the article has the date: **May 7th**
---
What people? I can see how some (myself included) would hate you for one-shotting a legendary enemy knowing full well there are other people who'd love to loot it as well.
---
And if you don't need a 1-star legendary yourself, then why shoot legendary enemy in the first place?
---
Well I don‚Äôt get upset with the people who do , it is usually overkill . It‚Äôs like busting out the good China to eat McDonald‚Äôs ( trump style)
---
I already scrapped my camera by accident
---
I mean,  you can just ignore them.  People assume every TSE is duped and infer the user is a cheater.  I think there's some jealously mixed in as well.  Its a game.  You do you.
---
Oh lol. Yeah I saw some folks were upset about a non cosmetics item. But they really are convenient. Idk that the regular repair kits would be as beneficial but the 150% durability most certainly is.
---
Workshops are so poorly-designed I don't even bother taking them over anymore. Most cases I just clear the area for caps reward and move on
---
That one star legendary for them is most likely better than their current gears/weapons.  I have a 1 star bloodied combat rifle that out performs a lot of my 3 star weapons because of that one bloody star.  Also, it doesn‚Äôt take a lot of effort to pull out a secondary weapon if other people are around and let others get a chance on a great drop.
---
AH, just like that power armor frame reward from BoS questline? Meh, who needs another frame...
---
... which turns out to be full ultracite power armor set ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
While I agree bloodied builds are the toughest, using one makes the game a bit tougher imo.
---
Having recently gone bloodied, I can say I died about 3 times my last silo run and plenty of times during my last sbq, simply because radiation management is a tricky lady. Prior to going bloodied, I could run the silo and sbq withiut using a single stimpack. 
---
So while bloodied is an absolute beast for pvp and pve dps, it definitely is not the easiest build to pull off, ESPECIALLY if trying to go without PA too.
---
It doesn't but when playing with other you should switch it out to something weaker so everyone can get a shot in.
---
A Bloodied Tesla sounds nice.  I have an Instigating one which destroys most mobs.
---
The other advantage of the Tesla is not needing to aim with any kind of precision.  I've never been on the business end of one, but I'm not sure it's even possible to physically dodge it.
---
I‚Äôd want a drinking animation first :)
---
Well for 1 thing you CAN get good 1 star weapons. It's down to personal preference and your own Build. 
---
There is nothing more annoying than trying to help a low level by doing a Whitesprings run and some selfish guy come wadeing in with his TSE shotgun and kills everything in 1 shot then just walks away. 
---
Its not about wanting the highest damage output. That's fine. I have plenty of TSE, it's about what and when you use it. Just have some consideration of others. 
---
If YOU think 1 star weapons are crap then don't kill 1 star legendarys!
---
Np
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOIL. LETHAL FORCE ENGAGED.
---
Ive only been getting back on this game about a month ago ive played since beta Ive never heard of two shot explosive weapons till then. Ive only traded and saved caps and now I have 3 tse weapons and two legacy weapons that are tse can't really complain since its pretty easy to obtain one
---
I started picking perks I don't have just cause I don't have them. It already takes ages to scroll through my perk card decks so what's another couple cards
---
I hear you BUT...
---
I'd rather PVP wasn't happening when I take a workshop, but it really doesn't matter, it is all in our heads.
---
I logged on a few days back, took red Rocket, was ready to move on to some challenges when a buddy showed up and started asking me questions. Three questions in and I realized his questions were not matching up, first being intro stuff and second being way more complicated, I got the sense he was recording this and his chatter was meant to entertain his followers.
---
Regardless, he then announced he had some stuff for me and was dropping a loot bag in front of the workbench, I said I didnt want anything but he insisted; as soon as I was in view I got one shot.
---
Now the real persona came out and he started in on a big rant, to which I disconnected to main menu and reconnected to a new world and took red Rocket again. He gained literally nothing save for a few of my caps. 
---
It wasn't even inconvenient and there was a certain satisfaction with NOT communicating with the kid, just disconnect from world and reconnect anew, easy-peasy and I stress again there was a certain satisfaction that came from not giving him one second of recorded pvp time or a single word. No griefer spends as much chat time trying to get me to open up if he wasn't going to benefit from the replies. Zero attention, zero recording, zero material gain.
---
If you get your head in the right frame of mind it's a pro, not a con, if you ken my meaning.
---
Are you actually getting the blue screen when you crash?
---
More likely to sell or scrap accidentially if it is a non-flagged item when I'm brain-dead scrapping weapons or apparel. So long Pearly Peepers!
---
I do have one but I'm looking to trade it for the arm plans.
---
If you won't get them this is the best way to find them I suppose. 
---
Grafton Steel, though you have to be really lucky. I spend loads of hours and only found the chest plan so far, which I already had. 
---
Another user linked me to this video a few days ago: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bIAWD0vmkwk&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Another building just next to it, with "Smelter" above the big doors, have some stairs leading up. Then you find a room with a Power Armor workbench thingt, in the mounted cabinet next to it is another spawn.
---
Two of the times ive done this people have got pissed off and started hitting me, didn't end too well for them haha
---
Mine is working fine (PC). Although it may be a tad slower recovery rate than before. Also, it only works when you're undetected.
---
If any enemies are alerted to you healing factor pauses. Stay hidden till you heal up.
---
[Here‚Äôs a video of the staff mods](https://youtu.be/WeDBrndQ1LM). The club looks a lot like it with cut off horns.
---
Well, if they want to counter Bloodied, what they need is a PvE enemy like the Children of Atom that deals with radiation damage.  Right now, Ghouls are the only common things that commit radiation damage, and they can't do it from a distance.
---
That said, if they went down that route, I'd like to see the Rad Resistant perk reworked.  There's no reason why that thing need 5 levels and it's a total rip-off/beginner's trap considering it doesn't even get close to the magic buff that Power Armor and the Hazmat Suit have.  You can achieve 50 Rad Resist easily with Lead Lining and Trapper or Marine armor.
---
Yeh I thought that but I can be walking around for ages on low health waiting for it to activate and...nothing
---
Intresting, I have some of those. Guess I'll try my luck too.
---
And probably science to mod it
---
I' ll try again in an open area but it seems that it doesn' t spawn but instead just makes a few beeps as if to say
---
' it can' t be spawned'  but before I spawn it the power armor is greenish
---
In a way they kind of lost some value when Devs change sit so only one person could loot the drop, I would always Call on in near Flatwoods for the noobs
---
For example, the sheepsquatch if not killed extremely fast will go immediately to the Brahmin, and I bet you know what would happen then
---
Right about there with you
---
There is a bug in game that sometimes sets your status to \[DANGER\] for no good reason.
---
We need a full on barter.
---
My 3\* armor, 2000 caps and a toaster for your Responder Jumpsuit, a pair of handcuffs and 10 bottles of vintage Nukashine.
---
(items above only listed as an example ... no judging or kinkshaming please)
---
Most tse weapons are duped
---
I've done "Free Range" event a number of times now and each time we managed to occupy him without any issues.
---
Oh ok thank you.
---
My problem is that guy most likely wasn‚Äôt being selfish he just has a really good gun and wanted to earn XP, and I was talking mostly about the sheepsquatch
---
Will add just one quick observation. The double XP weekend has turned players into one shot wonders. Time is money, I get it, but it‚Äôs no where near as fun as everyone working together.  I suspect come Monday things will calm down a bit.
---
Are you on pc?
---
Well, the good thing is that Iron Fist only has 3 ranks.  It's not like the other melee damage perks that have Expert and Master levels.  Strictly speaking, you don't *need* Incisor or Martial Artist with a weapon that does both.  It will do better with them, of course, but it's probably not worth the SPECIAL expenditure.
---
Xbox, should have clarified
---
I shoot down every cargo bot I see. Could also be a goldmine for any raiders...
---
Honestly not, and I didn‚Äôt say TSE in my post I just said explosive. They wiped out a lot of duped items so many of them are gone and I personally have picked up 4 explosive weapons all with great other effects.
---
There is a vendor in Whitesprings Hotel that sells that exact recipe.
---
Similar thing has been happening to me in The Burrows, but instead of this yellow it‚Äôs just random colors/black
---
Two of my best weapons are one-stars. 
---
I wouldn't yell at you necessarily. I would say to ease up and let that low level player (talking sub-50 here) tag the legendary. 
---
You never know what may spawn for that player that could help them, so let them tag the legendaries.
---
I've made the mistake of taking kills from low-levels before. I snatched a bounty off a 40-something a few weeks ago and immediately felt bad. It was just a reflex on my part. I ran back home and got them some things to try to make up for it. 
---
It's more of a point of courtesy than a demand. No one can make you be courteous.
---
Assault gas mask goes perfect with this. Try it out
---
It's the same thing for me but everyone just doesn't give a fuck about keeping the Brahmin alive. It gets really fucking frustrating being the only one trying to keep them alive to get good rewards
---
Alright, but why go through it if it doesn‚Äôt drop anything good?
---
This is kinda true but not really . End game is pvp , use adventure mode to lvl and gear up then switch to survival and kill some raiders
---
It only works when you are put of combat and in Hidden status. If you're in combat or Danger or Caution, or stuck in Danger or Caution status, it won't work.
---
Either stay hidden or if your stuck try reloging.
---
Well you didn't mention anything about that in your original post. 
---
Earning more XP at the expense of another is selfish. If you want to do that then that's fine however people will tell you that you are selfish so it's up to you. 
---
If there are low levels who are also trying to level up why not switch to a less powerful weapon so you don't do quite as much damage and give everyone a chance to benefit.
---
You get plans and there is a chance for a rare item drop too. It's worth doing
---
Really?? It doesn't say anything about that anywhere I can find and it used to work all the time? I would be in the middle of a fight either PvE or PvP and it would be working?
---
Not on the sheepsquatch?
---
I‚Äôve never seen a sheepsquatch drop a plan or a rare item
---
Idk then , I‚Äôve heard a lot of pc players complaining lately but that trend seems to go with the introduction to game mods . Try resetting your router or hardwiring to you Xbox to eliminate possibilities on your end . I‚Äôm on Xbox and haven‚Äôt noticed much of a difference
---
We just need human NPCs to be added to that list. Scorched aren't human enough.
---
It's a sailor's term for bathroom... My partner uses it all the time so I'm assuming that the OP is a sailor, related to a sailor, or lives in an area where nautical terminology is common.
---
My point is that I'd decline your offer of a witch hat or a tin foil hat for 25 caps, but I might pay you 5,000 caps for the right legendary item, if I really wanted it. 
---
Just because someone expects an outfit to be free doesn't mean they might not pay real caps for something useful.
---
I had like ten and used them all yesterday.
---
I constantly try and fix it I just hate the idea that I play this game so constantly knowing I‚Äôll go thru at least 3 crashes a session and potentially lose a lot of loot. Just lost all my aid and loot from crashing after dieing. And it‚Äôs hardly gotten better since the game started.
---
It kinda did already though. Well, it fell.
---
No.  She had been wandering around with me for quite a while. We she had joined me on that server for a trade. ... No workshop involved.
---

---
Try lowering DoF in Display settings all the way down. I think that is what fixed mine. Could have just been a coincidence though so idk if it'll actually help you. I'm on XB1 and it was really bad. Cleared my cache, recalibrated my TV settings to what the Xbox suggested, and then lowered the DoF in the game menu. Problem hasn't reappeared yet.
---
That comes from the event
---
I noticed i had stashed a full set of sentinel armor and cav armor and had no idea. Never used them and been more then happy with my -20% weapon weight almost full set
---
It definitely sucks to miss the limited items, I missed the Moonshine Mama head cause of the patch on the last day.
---
I disagree that limited sales have no place though. They drive sales and make the game profitable for Bethesda to maintain. If it wasn't, they'd put less and less into it until there's just the bare minimum needed to keep the servers up.
---
Neither of us owned a workshop and I watched the other player get one-shotted and she had to respawn. She was so dead I couldn't stimpack her.
---
I guess your not talking about the same sheepsquash, everytime I have killed him, i have got an a plan and a recipe along with other loot.
---
Do queen of the hunt and just server hop before finishing the quest if you didn‚Äôt find him,it‚Äôs a bit long but easier than roaming around looking for him
---
Yes really. I don't PvP so I can't answer that question. But I have the healing factor mutation and that's what I have experienced.
---
It isn't Wolverine healing lol
---
Lots of things are delicate. The game is more fragile than the emotions of all the fanboys defending it.
---
And that is SAYING something.
---
I tested it with the assault gasmask and that combo is pretty cool
---
And coming soon: Zetans!
---
If explosive weapons arent duped how is it that everyone has 3 or 4  "rare drop "  explosive weapons.  Duping still exists
---
Yeah you‚Äôll have mats but the plants stay on the floor and don‚Äôt float
---
You sir are a legend.
---
We need a way to swap perk cards via loadouts (let's call them "decks") on the fly. Sometimes I need to swap Exterminator for Glow Sight mid-combat, but the game doesn't pause as it's not Fallout 4
---
Tbh i really dont know why this is the rarest, you can find lots of dead raiders wearing this same outfit, you just cant loot them
---
I've been on PS4. I play a lot. I think there has been 1 server crash since the last update. Maybe 2.
---
I know people ask it a lot, but how good is your internet access?
---
yeah i get your point 
---
as its a light weapon you can have it as a good backup anyways i guess didnt know it benefits from both gunslinger and rifleman thanks for the tip
---
Ya, keep getting day glow ground in random places
---
Sounds like you're playing on the PvP beta?
---
They farm a lot
---
It does
---
Are you calling Liberty Prime a liar? üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ü¶Ö ü¶Ö 
---
Communism is just a temporary setback on the road to freedom
---
well how does it against scorchedbeasts and such?
---
I agree with you.
---
well how does it against scorchedbeasts and such? i will have a look i think i have a bloodied one if you are interested but i need to check that
---
Can make you one.
---
Yeah I did more experimenting, send to be framerate related.  Turned on v-sync and I haven't had an issue.
---
Also, DEFEND THE BRAHMIN.
---
Or accompany you to grafton where you can pull one off of a jeep.
---
So this one is dead huh , no alien so far
---
Fair enough. I didn‚Äôt realize there were rules on what you should and shouldn‚Äôt do with your own flux.
---
My internet has been really good honestly and I‚Äôm hard wire connected.
---
Dude is just a common sense, we are all there to do the same thing do and event/kill enemies. Weather your reasons is to lvl up or just farm legendary. 
---
But you killing everything in one shoot doesn't give the chance for everyone to get on it.
---
I can kill most everything one shot, and on nuke zones or events that I know legendary might pop up I use my 2nd weapon or anything that won't kill one shoot. 
---
With that some event that it doesn't matter like the SBQ or both sheepsquash events. 
---
It just not ruining someone else game time for you just showing how bad ass you are killing everything with one hit.
---
THAT THING IS RARE?! AHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
---
Gets brought up every other day and is definitely a high pick for new additions.
---
I'd even be okay if it comes at the cost of that same 100lb out of the stash space. It'd make muling less of a hassle so I'd be able to stay under the theoretical 700 much more easily than the current 800.
---
No god damn spiders!
---
Awesome. Happy to help.
---
Yeah me too. I was frustrated and filming it and realized when I looked around my frames dropped to around 260 and I was suddenly able to move again.  Didn't realize until the recording software added just enough extra overhead to put me in the right framerate region.  Hope V-sync works for ya.
---
Do you ever get to re allocate perk points?
---
Does the lack of AP options make it tough to use against SB's and Mutants?
---
This is what I've always thought as well. People only want it so they can brag about their unique item.
---
Thought it was just me
---
seems glitched to me. It defenatly used to heal me like wolverine. Had it for a long time and just noticed since patch 8.5 it's not working properly. 
---
I would get shot and bang, stright back to full health.
---
It's the back button on xbox1.
---
If you quickly go into 3rd person and then back, it sometimes stops the sound from happening.
---
I‚Äôd rather see ghoul NPC or a human radio host really.
---
If the game lasts and content keeps flowing it‚Äôs achievable.
---
Really?? I thought it was pretty cool. A hell of a lot better than hearing my character grunt every time...
---
Wait that's rare?
---
Perhaps not so much a vault as a bunker?
---
Psn - brm138 I have 30 ish I‚Äôll give you for a little bit of 45 ammo
---
Can you actually see a tentacle creature? I've been in the lucky hole mine plenty of times but now I'm starting to think I missed something.
---
I'm on ps4 and this weekend I've been getting a lot of bluescreens. It's normally ok but I've found everytime they do a temp change like the xp bonus it causes some sort of issue. It's like deals with the devil with this game.
---
I'm pretty sure that was a figure of speech, meaning "it could be a LOT worse", not that it was necessarily something to be literally thankful for.
---
Vertibot works just make sure it‚Äôs about to take off and really close to you , use ammo factory or any other place with friendly vertibrd
---
I have yet to see anything worth the run to get it done. I usually drop mine or give it to a really low level.
---
I stock and sell the purified water I can't consume with purifiers at my camp.  With lvl 3 Hard Bargain the vendors will pay 5 caps each for them.  And when I can accumulate anywhere north of 100 waters each time I play for a few hours, it's only smart to cash in on those 500+ caps.
---
Yeah, rad health reduction is working in a way that it reduces health instead of max health, it breaks all game mechanics that use current health, in most cases in player favor so no one complains about it
---
I posted the same thing about a month ago. It turns out that the PS4 has a zoom command. 
---
https://accessappleblog.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/ps4-zoom-feature/
---
Yeah I take them for the free atoms in the daily quests and that's it
---
I only server hop because my camp won't place, and if I can't have a world with my tower of power I'm not staying
---
Pulling your weapon out or unequipping it just before impact atleast cancels the animation, dont know about the sound
---
The event spawns at 3 locations. Look for Free Range. I have not seen the forest event spawn since the first day.
---
Honestly I just my enemies, it works best for me
---
I have no idea but it should be classed as a heavy weapon IMHO that thing is huge
---
The ones in Whitespring say Serve and Protect. It's the little things that I love
---
It‚Äôs classified as laser weapon
---
Rifle perks I believe
---
exactly im hording stuff for my alternate accounts as my only friend that plays 76 ist online often and when we play together i dont want him to spent two hours just standing there to get my loot another commenter stated out that im stupid because this topic gets brought up everyday i didnt know that as im fairly knew to reddit however i think it only proves the necessity of the topic i really hopes bethesda adresses this in the future
---
rifle
---
I've got 80 step up
---
I'll do that I wont be on for like another 4hrs though I'm at work but if your still on I have like 500+ rounds.
---
Other multiplayer online games do this, mostly ones that are open world or pvp. I forgot which game it was but 97% of reported hackers were logging on from China so they region blocked it
---
It does!?!? You‚Äôre the hero we need in the wasteland
---
I actually appreciate all the technically not hostile ones like frogs, foxes, chickens, beavers, squirrels it's nice not having everything trying to kill you
---
I‚Äôll be on later tonight for sure.
---
Also, just an FYI, RDR2 and GTA V are NOT sold in Saudi Arabia, while FO76 is. SA has laws against depicting smoking in pop culture due to it being one of the leading causes of death for men over there.
---
Omg, yes.  I ask every person I play with so thought I had modded something stupid.  I describe it as dropping a ton of bricks then throwing a xylophone down at the end just for kicks.  It sounds very old school kids show sound effect and I HATE IT WITH EVERY LEAP BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS IN POWER ARMOR JUMPING OFF STUPID SHIT.
---
I‚Äôll be on later tonight for sure
---
It takes a while to get used to doing it but when you keep doing it the animation feels like forever
---
As I said in the edit, the imposter head unlocking was a bug. It wasn‚Äôt in the game when I made this post, and has since been added to the atom shop. Apparently it has the same stats as a regular assualtron head weapon, but I have no idea personally.
---
If you meant the regular assaultron head, I still have no idea. I use shotguns.
---
In one of the passageways there's a route that's hidden by vines that you can actually walk through, I'm pretty sure it was Rifle Gaming that did a YouTube guide on how to get there.
---
It's interesting how Bethesda created a brand new asset that isn't reused anywhere else and hid it somewhere the majority of player's would never find it
---
Other spots ive seen it in the mire:
---
West of the Crevasse dam, just up the mountain there
---
North of thunder mountain power plant, near a trailer 
---
West of thunder mountain, just west of the glowing hermit crab spawn on the bridge
---
 Best of luck!
---
I've seen others say this is the worst mutation unless you invest heavily into being mutated. I.e. Max class freak, multiple mutations etc.
---
Shit chems for faster out of combat healing is just to high a price to pay.
---
When I got that I assumed my game has messed up again and said I had two when I only had one. I was about to scrap it and I thought, I better make sure I scrap the frame one and not my excavator one. So I put them both out and behold ultracite armour. My world changed that day.
---
PC users have a mod that let them do this.  I can't imagine playing without it now.  They really need to add this feature in for console players.
---
Yup, you can use the rug glitch to move the plants anywhere you want, so you can put them on a table, then put a round planter pot under them and they look kind of like they are growing in the pot.
---
You do know we get an atomic shop article every week now with info on things getting added, removed, sales, limited items and so on?
---
That's a much better idea.
---
This happen to me today buddy . No idea how to fix &amp; need help :(
---
I'm a bit worried about using third-party mods for this game. Wouldn't want to be perma-banned
---
They didn't even patch the dupes out of fo76 that came from fo4. Why do you think they would fix something else from FO4 before porting it over to fo76 but not fix the dupe issues?
---
They patched that. But the rug glitch still works, and is better than the campfire glitch anyways.
---
had the same problem yesterday its just annoying as hell even if its just a regular legendary robot
---
No, their base is in a secret door in a pipe in Mama Dolce's....
---
I've got a better question why do you want to "one shot" everything anyway?.  It just takes away the skill and the fun to me I prefer a fair fight that's a challenge
---
Oh I just thought my xbox was dying
---
Legendarys?
---
Tbf, some people aren't playing to max their caps but just want to wander and do stuff.
---
That one irradiates you right? What about radicool, ghoulish, overly generous. Then switch to a fast melee weapon and start dispensing radioactive stabbing and smashing. Maybe assaultron blade. Go with a theme! 
---
Then sun kissed to passively bring you can from the brink.
---
Laser at mid range, slice at close once you get all radded up.
---
Any idea to fix this issues ?
---
I have trouble believing the creators of the Liberators are good guys
---
And who says they can't do that?
---
To expand on that:
---
Oct 22, 2077 they thought there was a flood, "the only way to survive, is to find high ground or be swept away." But the Mothman's warning wasn't a water flood, it was a flood of radiation! Then they were vaporized on rooftops. -Letters in mothman museum basement. 
---
The few that survived went to the mine with Jeff Lane, and the high priestess before the bombs fell. Drawn by the power of The interloper. The priestess broke into the mine as soon as it was abandoned before the bombs fell. 
---
Some churches have a mothman figure effigy, More seem to have a bones and viney alters. As if the interloper was drawing in more followers. The interloper followers seem way more violent, requiring sacrifices.
---
You won't if any of your cows die.
---
Sell them
---
Or give them away to other people
---
As much as I like the idea the servers cant handle more than one base in an area. The developers have stated this a few times
---
 That's why we have limited items that can be placed on a budget with limited stash. Any more the servers start to break down.
---
 The technology just isn't there yet for this to happen.
---
You still need someone?
---
I found one last night while I was just wandering around farming. Didn't do the event and nobody was around it was just fighting some scorched.
---
How would that work?  Just seems like risk with extra steps...
---
Okay.
---
Pretty sure everything has a armor value and yes it's totally worth getting those perks
---
You won't be, Bethesda's FAQ mentions mods, and says they don't support them only because they may cause the game to crash. They don't say they are against the rules or anything(outside of the obvious cheating mods such as the lockpick one) But perk loadout manager doesn't do anything "cheaty".
---
So as long as the mod isn't straight up telling you where the lockpick sweet spot is, or giving you wallhacks or speedhacks, they don't care.
---
I honestly haven't done any trades because I didn't want to be scammed.
---
I got other raider underarmor plans from guided meditation.
---
It did that in 4 but it doesn't irradiate anymore.
---
Sure.  Sorry just saw this I'll be on and off all day but shoot me a message
---
Yes, it is classified as a ballistic weapon, so all rifle perks work with a gauss rifle.
---
I had one yesterday, thought it was was pretty cool
---
It uses pistol perks so level up those for more damage.
---
I have 148, I use one every once in a while for shits
---
Bethesda has said it's fine, but they won't support it, so if you break something while modding, you have to fix it yourself (or with community help).
---
Don't take my word for it.  Here's the official response.  https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod
---
Wait? Serious? I'm sure I was getting irradiated with one. Hmm, throws a spanner in the works slightly.
---
I farm a lot and have never found an anti armor explosive handmade but still i have seen hundreds of them being used and sold , strange how one of the most powerful weapons in the game are so prevalent
---
Give Bethesda 3 balanced Game Design(Not just ''I want too'' and ''Because its kewl and funny'' ) reasons why smoking needs to get implemented and they will probably hear you out.
---
As your level gets higher you will be able to craft better gear. You also need yo acquire the plans for the item.
---
Are there any numbers in the ESM files for the amount of Armor reduction from using Perforating and Stinging mags on rifles and shotguns? 40% for perforating seems pretty high.
---
or hold onto them for like 30 more days when the legendary vendor gets put into game on may 23rd. course means taking up quite a bit of stash space for awhile.
---
The animation takes so long
---
It makes it harder, that's why I have the backup western revolver/.44 for armored enemies. Pistols will always be harder anyway, but the black powdder pistol loads alot faster than the rifle, and still is incredibly punishing on bigger enemies.
---
all higher lvl weapons and armor unlock as u reach the lvl requirements, this happens every 10 lvls so at lvl 10 for lvl 10 gear then lvl 20 unlocks lvl 20 gear so on and so forth. if its a lvl 35 item then lvl 45 unlocks lvl 45 items
---
It does according to other people. I was trying every event in the savage divide. I just happened to get it from the messenger. This took me a long time. I was in the savage divide almost exclusively between levels 225 and 313.
---
If I find one and your on PS4 you can have it.
---
I'm sure of it. They just work like laser musket pistols now.
---
As far as I can tell, it Depends what it is. Some stuff levels every 5, so you can build new at 5, 15, 25. Like my Fire Ax - I cant build over 45.
---
Some stuff is on the 10s 10, 20, 30 etc.
---
Barring that - if you‚Äôre on XBone, try a hard physical disconnect reset. That clears glitches for me sometimes (like the Easter Eggs)
---
Barring that - Blame Bethesda üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
They're not in the game yet
---
That's Rule #1.  ^ - ^
---
Okay seems like I need to find a way to power level to 25 before this weekend ends.  But I work today and have GoT.  *sulks*
---
Keep it up! It's out there. Its on xbox too (my platform).
---
Oh, okay! I assumed it was every 5 levels, as I've been getting Level 15 weapon drops.  Good to know!
---
Assaultron blade could actually work. This character is kind of an RP character he was a tinker / mechanic so my whole story for him is that he finds an assaultron and figures out a way to use the head as a weapon so the blade could also make sense.
---
Yeah, just googled to see if it was a bug and sure enough it is. Four months later and still no fix.
---
I have that to quite often. Also on nearby textures. No idea what's causing it.
---
I got those in the process of trying to get the underarmor plans. I had no idea they were so rare till after I gave them away. It's cool. I like my busted green shirt with combat boots and duct tape on my pants.
---
Except they are also locked and you can become wanted when you pick the lock of someone else‚Äôs drop. It‚Äôs happened to me a few times and they who called it in waited for me to do it and then sniped me from the hills.
---
Slenderman confirmed
---
I think it was guided meditation that dropped them.
---
It is a robot, so not likely
---
Honestly good of them to ruin one of the few decent things in the game
---
They don't posses any significant materials in my experience and the running around to upload them and then run to get it hasn't been a highly rewarding experience.
---
I think to dad is a few steps away from him. There is another dead bear nearby with harpoons/ arrows in it next to a dead person.
---
This isn't Plunkbat?
---
While i do think that we need something to happen i think that your idea wouldn't make any sense lore-wise i'm afraid.
---
Only the Rusted Knuckles I think, which can be found in the Ash Heap. The rest need to be bought
---
I have one i would just lile to keep making them. I cant afford the plan from the vendors.
---
I hate myself for using pipe weaponry, but yes, it is the best.
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it. They look pretty good.
---
Ooo, where can I stumble upon that gem?
---
Bruh it's like five minutes
---
That requires completely new models and I don't see the investment being made for new map designs, when they can just update existing ones. Bethesda loves reusing models. I've played golf on the course next to the vault, Id love to see it.
---
 Gold is pretty insignificant, but if there was technology stored away there it would make more sense. Or if it was a secret FEV lab. We currently don't have npc's either, so the survivors in the sublayers of the vault would need some sort of explanation. FEV is the only thing that makes sense.
---
If you're running bloodied, especially no power armor, the solution for silos is to use a hazmat suit in the radiation zones. Sure you pose the unyielding effect and some damage resist, but you would ideally have enough damage resistance through perks and serendipity to make it through. At least, that's how I've done it previously.
---
Outstanding! Yes mr. messenger is a bitch. I wish there was a mission to destroy the mr. messenger dispatch yard. This event I avoided the most. After 100 levels of trying to get this plan I got desperate. Imagine my surprise when it was the event that dropped the plan.
---
I don't believe Beth will see it as an issue. If you can't lock onto someone because they're behind a blade of grass and your chance to hit them in VATS is 0% and that's fine, why would they think that if a friend is blocking your LoS you should be able to hit the enemy behind them?
---
I want more love for VATS mechanics. It's so underused cause it's slower than run-and-gun Bloodied Handmade build.
---
I'll do it for the quad lever rifle and TS minigun. need any other mods? i know em all
---
Honestly the difference between power armor (or at least X01, T60, and T51) are so negligible that you should just play with whatever you like the look of. The nods are easy enough to get since the vendor revamp and the damage resistance doesn't matter as much when you're pushing into the 400-500 range.
---
Flags are absolutely necessary. They need the following base set:
---
USA(check)
---
UK(y not)
---
WV Flag
---
Watoga Flag
---
Flag for each Faction(enclave, bos, resp., raid)
---
VTUniversity
---
Vault 76(gear logo)(+51,63,94,96)
---
Whitesprings logo ‚Äòbanner‚Äô
---
US Army Insignias
---
That Snake Insignia inside the missile silos, on a FLAG.(or else its all wasted)
---
So intellect perk that reduse damage to weapon working for it too?
---
Truthfully I don‚Äôt think you can tame them. Even when I have animal friend or wasteland whisperer (or even both) on I don‚Äôt get a pop up to pacify them. If you could pacify them then there would be a chance that it could be tamed.
---
That's the alien we're suppose to take a picture of!
---
Depends. A lot of people say the durability of PA is fine, and in that case you'd want to only equip during repairs. It will also slow down the breakdown rate considerably, so if you see your PA is breaking then it'd be worthwhile to run the perk all the time.
---
Its been this way for forever. Shoot a hr ..hit bash and shoot no reload animation to wait through its been like that since fo3 lol its nothing new and not an exploit
---
Now that‚Äôs funny stuffüòÇ
---
Each core generator can make up to 8 cores per hour, but can only hold 3 at a time. If you want to stock up on fusion cores, slap on contractor and hold all 3 power plants for a while and travel between them.
---
There's a secret room in the hall with the secret stash door, in a seperate area in the hall. then there's a secret room inside that secret room.
---
And if you pay close attention while reloading the bullet appears in the mag way before the animation is finished. So switching weapons takes abkut the same amount of time as the actual reload minus the animation. So no exploit just good timing
---
&gt;398 posts in t_d
---
lol
---
I think of it as I landed on a mechanical sheep..
---
Most players only turn it on when they are going to repair their armor. However, you can keep it on all the time if you feel like your armor is breaking too fast
---
Used to see it all the time, but haven't seen it in a while
---
I‚Äôve never seen it, but I‚Äôll start looking out for it. Thank you!
---
I don't know if its the same weapon ur looking for BUT this weeks survival weekly challenge happens to reward u with a .50 cal heavy gun with faster reload speed, faster rate of fire and fires two shots
---
all u need to do is craft/scrap certain items in survival mode and its all urs, u can gather everything u need in adventure mode then load into survival mode at ur camp and do ur crafting then leave when ur done
---
took me 30mins roughly and I never left my camp or got hassled :)
---
How about even just the ability to point at something?
---
I've only managed to loot the Imposter twice, in all the times I've done that event. Seems to disappear a *lot*
---
Yes. I hear this from a lot of new characters. I tried joining a team to do roses quests. I don't play much with a team but it seems you only get caps when repeating a quest with a team that you've already completed.
---
Not a bug its ment to be this way so your not droppin bases every 5 seconds kinda like a penalty. In fact its been this way since launch. Wait an hour you wint have to pay more then your budgets worth
---
Firstly I'm not selling witch hats or tin foil hats.. I'm selling a witch costume that doesn't have a physical spawn... It's rare and I sell many for 100caps.
---
And secondly I don't care what you think... other people buy all kinds of outfits... My point was about people requesting X item with a high value but not being able to afford X item of low value..
---
Apologies if the witch costume wasn't a good example..  Smh
---
To be fair, Chinese hacking and teaming ruined pub g for Asia and the Middle East.  It‚Äôs forced many other games to region lock China so they can‚Äôt ruin the gaming experience of other regions.  That said, Chinese hacking and teaming is a non issue here.  I don‚Äôt even think fallout is allowed there due to censorship laws.
---
That has been going on since Patch 8 at the latest.  Then you have the Black Water, and Occlusion Issues...  Those are from patch 1+...  ^_^
---
Yeah. At one point in my despair I would have paid you big time caps for that plan. üòÑ
---
I will check that out. Thank you i forgot that was the weekly.
---
My friend is using a sneak build with rifles and managed to get a rapid fire instigating gauss rifle yesterday. It is almost as good of a roll as he could get.
---
Max lvl
---
I read this comment and I legit laughed the shit out of my ass
---
I have lost a bloodied fire axe that way, it sucks.
---
if I ever get my main account back I know I have plenty of rare spare plans. i hoard like a maniac.
---
If you read the in game lore for the Chinese, they're just as bad, with their communism taken to extremes instead of the US capitalism. They also have a streak of "victory even in death" that makes me wonder if Bethesda's fallout has them as the first to actually pull the trigger, even if it was a reaction to an assumed first strike attack by the US.
---
Super cool and inspiring.  Thanks for sharing!
---
Nice!
---
Let alone read
---
Holy shit, and I thought it was because of the usual mod problem.
---
I used one to get the ‚Äútake a picture of a cargo bot‚Äù achievement... I usually drop a few in lower level areas for newbies.
---
I use bloodied with a prime receiver.  It does great damage on scorchbeasts and the like, and a one star instigating regular crossbow on weaker stuff. 
---
It's clearly outclassed by like a lever action or any other sweet gun, but it's very fun to play. Your bolts go very far with very little resources expended.  Would be nice if they got a bump though.
---
Go for it! Do them all. It's what I did. From distinguished guests to the messenger. I tried to just do unranium fever solely and got nothing of value. Plus I feel I wasted time waiting and server hoping when there were good savage divide events on the map ready to start.
---
I will send you a YouTube video soon... and you will have the answers...
---
Sentinel can definitely be a primary. Not sure about Cavalier.
---
Well essentially I have chlamydia...
---
i play around 7pm est to 3am est most everyday, if youre looking for an anchor on ps4, send me an invite (just put in friends req the note ya there for an anchor, i dont accept random invites: Silune). ive got quite a few i run with and very seldom do we have room, and like last night there was two parties of us running together as well as several others on my friends list in the same server, unless the whole server shutsdown/resets im pretty static.   
---
but would help keep you in the same server. games been out for awhile and like others have said someone running a lone wanderer build wouldnt want a party and those like me are probably already running in a full party. so random invites or requests especially from people ya dont know just doesnt seem to happen much anymore. along with the possibility of someone just wanting to see where your camp is to go destroy it.
---
What‚Äôs the wedding ring?
---
What?
---
I know Sentinel can be primary, ie. I have a Sentinel's robot right arm.
---
I already tried those they weren‚Äôt as stimulating
---
Yeah no I waited there for a half hour and no meat pile
---
What is it called and where did you get it?
---
Try Grafton steel works, running around inside and you should find plans. If none are BoS, don't loot them! Just server hop and keep trying.
---
But when Patch 9 comes out, they should be added back to vendors I believe.
---
The legendary was by himself
---
I wish the friendly targeting was something you could toggle on or off.
---
Think your friend may be a douche. A dumb douche.
---
Ran into one in Cranberry Bog straight after getting all my PA broke by a behemoth. It was a long fight lol.
---
"Gimmie a secound ghouls, I gotta lie down and get up again"
---
\*ghouls slap\*
---
"**Do you mind?**"
---
Honestly, I don't think the game should let you lie down or sit down when in combat, Fo4 didn't allow you to do that!
---
You cant change it on consoles, but you can on PC.
---
unfortunately its gonna be a annoying hurdle to get over, I hated it too, and I event had to start using my T-45 and excavator power armor to be able to handle the enemies
---
I found using a good melee weapon helped me keep my ammo supply up so I can save it for more important enemies when I had to deal with higher lvl enemies, usually high lvl scorched and ghouls weren't too much of a issue compared to super mutants though
---
But he is ready for the raider life
---
I haven't had the yellow vomit smear yet but I did turn Appalachia into a [discotheque](http://imgur.com/gallery/PO63RnI) twice and I've seen the snow in the ash heap as well as all the ground going black except any part that is raised
---
Seriously, it‚Äôs infuriating.
---
Out of the fair few times I‚Äôve used a sleeping bag in game, I have intended to do so precisely once.
---
Either server hop a couple of plan spawns or build a flux capacitor. Latter is probably quicker.
---
\*Reaches for TSE The Dragon frantically\*
---
I've had this glitch before, didn't know how it triggered, and sometimes I'd have 4 shots loaded which was weird, but was useful aswell!
---
Items that are only available for a limited time, such as one day, cannot be purchased by those who can't play that day. 
---
The result of this is that I've missed items that I would have bought, and still have free atoms I haven't used because I don't want what is in the shop.
---
If they put everything in the shop, I could buy what I want when I have time to play, even if I have to pay for it.
---
Just be careful around the Road House bar, we get...hungry
---
First camp I saw I snuck into thinking the same thing, started loading up and realized we had alot of the same stuff..... Lmao
---
How did you get the Yao guai plan?
---
Not sharing legendary kills is a dick move. It's an even bigger dick move if you're in a group event. And it's a major dick move when you are so high level that you think "you can't get good 1 star stuff". 
---
Then why are you so gung ho to kill that 1 star enemy that you can't share it? There are good 1 star items and it's the low level players that are looking for it. So stop being a dick or at least don't complain that people call you one when you act like it.
---
Also the owlet, how did I miss these...
---
I am on Xbox and that is incredibly kind of you. I know I will find another one eventually, maybe even some better. It was just one of those funny little thing that happens in life. Thanks for reading.
---
Such a bummer, eh?
---
Dear god no, this is up there with Marsupial for utility mutations. 
---
Want to not worry about making / carrying stimpacks? This thing will heal you up out of combat constantly. Your general PVE stim use will go way way down, and you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre only using them occasionally and mostly for SBQ / Squatchposter.
---
I used one yesterday for the first time in ages. Kind of forgot about them tbh.
---
Yes, everyone has an intrinsic armor value. Being able to bypass that is very strong, like an Anti-Armor rifle with Tank Killer 3 is amazing
---
I think everyone secretly did this their first time.
---
Wow..
---
Thats what i wear! Along with the surgical mask
---
I have plenty of explosive weapons. They do not all come w/ TS.
---
I‚Äôm not sure it makes them selfish, but I suspect most folks are tagging (in addition to, you know, making sure the event doesn‚Äôt fail).
---
I have this glitch with 2 black powder pistols as well.
---
I ran into the same issue when I first started out. However, I found that once you reach around level 30+ you are more than capable of taking on level 60ish enemies without too much issue (excluding things like scorchbeasts obviously). So the issue dies off pretty fast. Also the max level spawnable depends on the region you're in, so if you are really having difficulty with high leveled enemies then I would suggest staying out of the Savage Divide and Cranberry Bog as enemies up to level 99 can spawn in them. The Forest, the Mire, and the Ash Heap all have a max enemy spawn of less than 40 iirc, so sticking to those areas for a bit might help.
---
I understand, it's happened with me and workbenches. Sometimes I'm just hopping and doging all the invading liberators at my CAMP, and next minute my character decides that he fancies a Nuka Cola Dark while being wacked with flying laser blenders.
---
One time this happened I accidental interacted with my cooking station, and a super mutant just destroyed it as the menu popped up and my initial reaction was "How dare you, I wanted myself some nice Iguana bits!"
---
But yeah, Beth needs to implement the "No interaction with benches, chairs, beds whatever while in combat" back.
---
Yeah this happens to a lot of new players tho, me and my buddy were playing a few months ago, and when he found someone else's camp, he tought he could steal from the guy lmao
---
Agreed. In a similar note, I had no clue how valuable and easy the civil war top hat was until about two glorious weeks before it was corrected.
---
The dailys broken
---
A friend had the server disconnect on him and when he logged back in, he was missing power armor pieces with mods and the equipped weapon at the time!
---
No guarantees that it won't be damaged by the radiation!
---
Well the question of 'who' fired the nukes first has been left deliberately ambiguous. I certainly won't consider the 'Red Chinese' to be angels but they did undergo major reforms. Things were okay with the US until the sabotage of Chinese efforts to drill for the world's last remaining oil resources.
---
I like to think the aliens fired on both sides at the same time, and they directly influence vault-tec. There is diffidently no good side once the faction size is above tribe level. Good tribe factions i can think of are the Minutemen, Lyons pride, and the Responders. Those are small tatos though.
---
Nuka Dark with Cola Nut and  the proposed Quack Surgeon stacked. I‚Äôd only ever be limited by Nuka and Snaptail availability.
---
Fair point....though the war had been raging for quite a while by then. Both sides created all sorts of nasties. 'Annihilator Sentry Bots' and FEV experiments certainly don't lend good credit.
---
I ventured to top of the world about level 10. Got over encumbered n dumped tons of stuff in the overseer's stash thinking I could get it back.....lol
---
The meat pile is rarely in the same place as the corpse. It can even be where the mob was initially spawned or sometimes the meat pile is generated where some giblets dropped.
---
Also no reason to be so upset about it, it's just a furious tesla, not something actually useful.
---
The tesla rifle isn't such a great furious weapon, the rate of fire is just okay but the range sucks. Also for furious to work correctly you need to hit one target a few times, the tesla sucks at that too. You know, the lightning jumps to other nearby targets. 
---
Bloodied, Two-shot, Instigating and even executioner's are much much better legendary modifiers for a tesla than furious. Heck i'll even take a ghoul/mutant/zealot over a furious tesla.
---
Teslas are usually used to tag lots of mobs, extremely useful in areas where there are lots of people. The damage it can deal isn't wow enough to make it a viable solo pve play. You can pick a lever action or handmade and it'll be more efficient. 
---
Then there are 2 bugs with the tesla rifle:
---
1. If you spam fire it you'll encounter a bug where you won't be able to damage anything until you relog.
---
2. The ash piles left behind by a tesla can cause the infinite loot loading bug.
---
then you were playing with it bugged
---
Funny stuff.
---
I had a new player at my chem shop right outside the ‚Äúwelcome to flat woods‚Äù sign under the big tree and when he walked up to the counter, he thought I was selling stuff that he thought was mine saying *‚Äúyou having a garage sale or something cause someone could just steal this stuff‚Äù*. Suffice to say, I tried my best not to laugh while explaining that was his own loot from the stash box he had.
---
Why not sell them instead of just dropping them?
---
Oh that‚Äôs WAY worse, bummer.
---
Thats what I figured thanks. I figure picking up a few stacks of barbarian would be good. Just getting back into playing the game and efficiently building my character
---
Leather coat and i got it from an Always Vigilant event
---
I am level 182, I know what I'm doing. I checked everywhere for the body, the game despawned the corpse, it has been happening to a lot of people lately.
---
They just keep flat out, brazenly lying to the fans. Not just any fans, but the hardcore dedicated ones that actually do give feedback on here. 
---
I read this forum, not once did I see anyone actively encourage or ask for repair kits. Where‚Äôs this community that kept giving them feedback that that‚Äôs what we need or want? I‚Äôve seen the same things that need fixing since day still and people asking for that but not repair kits. Just give up the charade already bethesda, we can see through the malicious PR.
---
Probably the rarest outfit/Item in the game.  
---
Literally have not seen anyone wear this nor sell it.
---
Seen a couple of variants on sale with the backpack (Traveling leather coat) but this clean version might as well not exist :D
---
Tell me about it Prime, using autos was pretty good in fallout 4, so figured it would be worthwhile in this game too.
---
Had to use google to find the corresponding reddit thread of the recent ITV. What the hell? Why isn't this #1 on the frontpage?
---
Would love to see a backpack that removes 50 carry weight but inherits the Hazmat suit perk. (basically radiation resistance you otherwise cannot get outside of PA)
---
Dude! I wear the surgical mask too! Bah!
---
I believe the targeting mod is still broke.
---
They should definitely add bulk option as well as have option for player requesting to suggest a price for approval.
---
That being said, I've never ran into that specific scenario as the only times I've sold ammo has been via reddit. So I'm able to communicate via subreddit comment, direct message, or even the ps4 messaging app once they've adding me as friends to join my world. Makes it much easier for me to let them know, 1:1 for half the ammo requested, then the rest at 0. To make it 0.5 total.
---
[](/celestiablush1)I honestly thought that this is what that staircase is for. I just figured I was placing it wrong.
---
I had the opposite happen to be my first day playing.  I ran across a dinky little camp in flatwoods with all the workbenches out and an extra sleeping bag for camp visitors.  It had been partially destroyed by mole rats so I repaired his walls and then left a bunch of ammo, stims, and a few weapons mods in his stash for him.
---
Imagine my surprise when I checked my stash at the next train station and all that stuff was in there.  I facepalmed so hard.
---
I had one run on the Forest spawn last night, it's on the top left of the map, the farm closest to the lumber place in the top left corner iirc, and it spawned a level 50 sheepsquatch. He dropped a furious super sledge :)
---
Don't dare kill an enemy in water lest ye spend the next few minutes watching your character drink nasty irradiated water over &amp; over
---
I've had 8 explosive weapons drop for me. Several have been god roll kinda stuff. Bloody explosive, quad explosive. TSE.
---
I've also had 4 given to me back in the hayday of duping. So there's still a lot of duped gear, but not as much as you might think.
---
Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I said "I'll have a wolf or a stingwing **between** myself and one of the cows", meaning it is not obscured by the cow, in clear line of sight, but the proximity of the enemy to the friendly for some reason blocks VATS. Give it a try. Let a wolf get right up on a cow, then try to VATS it. You can't lock on. You can manually shoot it, but good luck hitting the bastard consistently they way they hop and zip around. Same thing with stingwings. Or molerats. I think the reason is that if part of your aim point rests on a friendly it prevents you from using VATS, although it SHOULD just lock the nearest **hostile** target to your aim point when you attempt to use VATS. A couple lines of code telling it to do so would fix all this.
---
Nice, thanks. I'll go look for it soon.
---
So, it's all rather secret then? No wonder I missed it.
---
Oh I full-on hoped they would hatch into pastel-colored Deathclaws and tear shit up in your CAMPs
---
"it's mostly garbage" - that killed me
---
lmao
---
Poor bastard
---
maybe not heal, but temporary shields. Fits more for fake healing
---
I get that, it started happening a few days ago and today I have lost all my PA pieces have just the frame now also my brewing stations have both gone from my camp, checked the one at Whitesprings and that one for me has gone as well, I am seeing other players with and without there PA pieces and a lot of the apparel is bright purple including peoples pipboys, can't use the aim on my guns anymore and when I go to the open range events the sheepsquatch is invisible to me so I have to rely on the other players killing it and seeing where they are looking so I can grab the loot as I can't see it, so there is a lot that has gone wrong in the last 24hrs, submitted a ticket to the Dev's but I won't hold my breath on that one, what is wrong with these people.
---
On ps4 i went to do the feral ghoul horde in ash heap. Saw super mutants fighting a legendary level 50 sheepsquatch. Took 900 rounds from my level 25 .50 mg to kill it lol!
---
Got a 2 star assassins 10mm smg with the second star being +50% to vats damage. Would really be cool in pvp i guess.
---
"oh man this is so weird he has all the same stuff I have in my stash"
---
I only have a severe receiver. I haven't found enough lever actions to scrap yet.
---
Well if you do know what you're doing i'm failing to understand why so much drama for a mid-low tier weapon...
---
But anyway, you do you and i hope you'll find tons of furious tesla rifles in the future maybe even a furious The Dragon
---
They should have a dummy hidden character whose only purpose is to load in along with your normal character, and that hidden character will only be an item mule, with limited storage, which will be accessible only from a special "transfer stash" stash box. 
---
So every time you go into a game with whatever character, you can access that hidden character's limited storage by building a special "transfer stash" in your CAMP and use it to transfer stuff between characters.
---
Haha
---
Hilarious
---
How often can this event spawn? Do you just have to take a chance and go there?
---
Back in the early days, I came across a box in the wild. I flipped my shit looking at all the loot inside, spent about 5 min picking and choosing what loot to take so I could still fast travel to stash it. It was a stash box.
---
I would also like to be able to mod em. Let me slap a recon scope on it. Chameleon armor makes it very hard to aim.
---
Probably coming when we can actually choose factions for pvp and other stuff. When choice really matters. 
---
I hope they tie the decorations to the factions, so if you change factions, the decor changes too. Say you have a responder flag on the wall and changes to enclave. Now it's an enclave flag on the wall.
---
Ah, so a random drop from a random event, cool. I do all the events I can all the time, hopefully I'll get lucky someday. Thanks.
---
Can also kill the animation by hitting sneak right at landing or jumping again real quick (this may be part of marsupial)
---
I'm guessing not.
---
You actually can do this 
---
https://youtu.be/l1KxeKSU8Bo
---
Just be careful because it can cause bugs
---
I just bought the plan then made&amp;scrapped a bunch of lever guns.
---
If you have a bit more patience you can watch some youtube video for lever gun locations and scrap those.
---
Huh you having a garage sale or something. That‚Äôs funny!
---
Are you aware of the stair stacking glitch that actually allows you to do this?
---
Not being a coder I assume the same thing. Also explains why they have no unique ID's for items and no ability to log trades and no ability to track inventories in real time.
---
Don't need any of that stuff for a single player game and it's probably data intensive to make the engine do those things.
---
Thank you for the tips!
---
The path finding on the Brahmin needs so damn much work it‚Äôs not even funny.
---
The posters are in game since long time... maybe beginnig
---
I would have liked Bethesda to add a Stats page on Xbox.. I
---
It's the only game I've played on Xbox that doesn't have one. I enjoy useless info like how long I've played, how many enemies I've killed, etc.
---
Yeah that would be great thanks. Honestly it is really the weapon just the fact that this bug made it past testing
---
Damn!!!
---
The only mod I'm running is the HoloHUD, which gives you a transparent power armor HUD. I can't stand the vignette and obscured FOV.
---
Could have just bought it from the enclave.
---
I know I did
---
Could just be server stress, double xp weekend &amp; no appreciable reason for people to not be home (such as Easter last weekend).
---
That said, performance for me on PC has only steadily gotten better with each patch. Don't think that is the norm unfortunately.
---
I'd even take 500 honestly. Anything is better than 20.
---
I know people have said "well then they'll just AFK time". Well it's a lot more effort and time spent to hit that goal, and if they wanted to do they.. Then God speed. It's like 316 days of play time.. And they'd have to eat and drink a ton, etc.
---
Can confirm my camp is west of the big and he likes to scare the shit out of me
---
Nice... but seriously if that is the workaround... they should stack by default. What bugs would happen? Floating, misaligned stairs?
---
Ty
---
*You're in Free States Territory now. No Government interference here.*
---
They just need to expand on the inspiration, WV succeeding from Virginia in the civil war. [Here's Badass WV civil war Battle flags.](https://imgur.com/a/phtxaoS)
---
Your foreskin looks horrible and that‚Äôs why it scared that woman in case you were wondering
---
It was the unyielding giving you more strength. When nerd rage goes off it is at the same HP as the maximum benefit of unyielding.
---
Thanks ill put that in mind.
---
If you're a VATS user try to stay away from two shot rifles. They're terrible for VATS/hip fire.
---
If you manually aim it's not a bad combo.
---
Yeah I've changed mine to white on PC. The best side-effect is the flashlight is white instead of green.
---
Roger. Just keeping the issue alive so we can stack without the glitch. Seems like a no brainer.
---
Berry mentats act like a detect life spell
---
So there is no main questline to end they game.
---
Black powder pistols are pretty good. They aren't ungodly slow to reload and are fairly accurate. Even non legendary ones so decent damage and you can buy the plans from the vendors in whitesprings. 
---
If you carry 2 or 3 and get good at swapping weapons you can blackbeard yourself up and keep pulling out a fresh one to use on those tough enemies.
---
That would be a terrible path for the game to take
---
Just the fact that you care so much about the legendary drop is what ruined this game.
---
You're no better than the guys spamming it.
---
Everyone seems to think the only thing that matters in this game is their legendary drops. Everyone becomes a fucking tryhard treating the game like CoD or some shit to rush and blitz everything as fast as possible.
---
Legendary weapons really ruined the game tbh
---
I‚Äôll be honest the changes you‚Äôve described are in line with real crossbows and bows, minus the loading on quads. Like how would you load a bow for quad, then only fire one at a time.
---
Recon scope
---
The only reason I didn‚Äôt do this was because I saw my friend do it.
---
Melee (mostly) player here experiencing the same.
---
Yep, last week I did it haha
---
Oh I never knew that
---
Sometimes floor pieces that you attach to the stacked stairs can‚Äôt be scrapped or stored. I think it‚Äôs when you have three or more floors. So if you do make a third floor just have a plan in mind so you‚Äôre not stuck with floor pieces you don‚Äôt want.
---
u/Aten_ra
---
The robots only attack you for the remainder of your time on that server, they‚Äôre not still attacking you
---
That's a grind
---
We all did it once :)
---
I agree, image all the wood armor we could make
---
I‚Äôm all for that
---
Duping still exists  nuff said
---
Not always, I‚Äôve gotten 3 once and 2 once
---
I get this every time I do the Encrypted event, And it usually goes away after a few fast travels.
---
Shit I‚Äôll take em
---
Agreed, that was so frustrating to watch.
---
I had to drop the 4th holotape before logging off. After that, the quest continued at "Report to medical center".
---
My friend seems to claim this only happens with his TSE Handmade.
---
I recently leveled 60 times to change my build to a VATS Crit build from Melee just because of it being a little weak in PVP. My AAE Handmade, AAE Lever Action and AAE Hunting Rifle seem to work flawlessly. I tried my. TSE Handmade.. And the second bullet does seem to break it sometimes. It isn't consistent. However my TSE Lever Action I can't get a bead on if it's the same result.
---
But I've never had any 0% issue I don't think.
---
If I had to guess, TSE may just be messed up? Not sure what you're using weapon wise though.
---
Platform?im on one x and had trouble to find them to,spend many hours to find and also server hopped 15 times for one place,stil no luck,then suddenly finally the dead dude showed up @ colonel kelly monument
---
Pretty much this.
---
If I'm near a tower, I'll call one in, only to be disappointed with the drops. In a way I feel like they should be buffed, but on the other, it's easy loot.
---
Yes, XBOX.  That's exactly where I've been server hopping this morning.  Now trying Wavy Willard's.
---
I have this method in my current build. Floating is a part of it, and be careful to place floors, because they can't be deleted. And you can't place it down again if you want to move or blueprint it, because of floating errors. 
---
On the positive side, grounded mobs don't use the stairs at all.
---
It should be scaled, early game they're great and by lvl 20 what's the point?
---
Two-shot has a pretty nasty accuracy debuff, that's all. Anyway, good luck in-game :D
---
What flooring is that??
---
I'll consider that whenever i find a set of power armor.  the spawns are always picked clean by the time i gt off work.
---
The vendor doesn't pay the same price as what the Pip-Boy shows. Vendor pricing is influenced by Charisma level &amp; the hard bargain perks, so it's not variable based on each characters setup
---
You are not invisible, you are simply crouched with no marker on the radar. Discovered that the hard way when my BRIGHT YELLOW Excavator PA got me sniped at from 200m away.
---
I was having it with my Lever Action, bf was having it with his LA and a Pump Shotgun
---
I don't think they will make this part of the game. It would upset the balance of play if there was a built in mechanism to transfer stuff between characters.
---
There's a work around to do it and that keeps the really motivated ones happy without allowing everyone's second character to be stacked with god roll stuff.
---
Haha @ willards was the place i hopped 15 times with no luck,goodluck!
---
I've been out of the loop for a few months. What's so great about sentinel and cavalier armor?
---
You're not invisible with chameleon armor on? I turn invisible to myself but no one else?
---
This was a thought that crossed my mind before fo76 was released
---
So I wasn't the only one who did this too! Lmao üòÇüòÜüòÅ
---
They did, they‚Äôre just not buildable
---
This is more common than you think!! I had a friend think the same, he even laughed as he emptied the stash in Flatwoods üòÖ
---
Hmmm very odd, I'll have to check again today.
---
Now that I really think about it, I do know that sometimes I have to shoot a little more than needed at 95% in PVP. But I also assume it doesn't do damage maybe from either lag, or their build. Probably not the case, but my AAE Handmade generally is a 2 tap then crit shot and they're dead, so I'm usually just smacking the fire button until I hear the Crit meter full. LOL.
---
I guess I'm so worked up in the moment usually with how fun my new build is that I haven't paid attention nearly as much. I'm sure it's inconconsistent too, but I know that TSE absolutely acts up.
---
ok thanks
---
I'll gladly do it for free as long as you can provide the materials!
---
Craft it!
---
The recipe for X-01 is fairly easy to acquire.
---
Awesome! I honestly appreciate it. I have no main quest line for some reason. From what I read online, the next mission is at the firehouse. I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here! I am tuck n tape on Xbox. I will add you tonight. Thanks again for the thought.

100% PA Bloody build. I use XO 1 with shocks and protocols
---
You on PC? I have more cobalt than anything else and don't really use it. I'd be willing to trade 15-20 for crimson and/or fluorescent straight up.
---
This. I know everyone wants to level up as there build style but at lower levels PA and a sledgehammer will make progress a whole load easier.
---
What they should have done is have the ability to break down legendary gear on the benches. once you break down, say, 10 items with assasin you get an assassin flux. 
---
You then craft a raw item for any plan you have. You can then use the flux to build your weapon.  As you earn more flux you can add more effects until you get it to 3 star material. 
---
This allows the game to reduce the amount of weapons and armor laying around.
---
I think the vendor will do something similar but this could have been a workbench mechanic.
---
I like the eggs, the black one is rather cool. the best thing i've noticed about the eggs is that they are stack-able, so you can create some weird walls with them :-)
---
I have a furious exploding gatling laser with reduced weight. Was wondering what that is worth?
---
God yeah, everytime I jump and crash down I swear I hear a sheepsquatch noise. Normally to stop that I just open inventory mid-air and don't close it until I hit the ground, cancels the sound and animation.
---
I can relate. I checked out someone else‚Äôs stash the other day and all their stuff was shit as well.
---
Maybe the old bog town
---
my Mama's family is from WV and I fell in love with the Free States in game with the first contact. it felt like coming home.
---
I'm pretty bothered by how they are portrayed as just conspiracy theorists :/ it's such an overly simplified trope that doesn't do the culture there justice!
---
I love here at a character, just don't think it's a good idea to be her. Really wish they add more to her story in the future, she was the most fun I have in the game so far. Still tune to her station once in a while when i'm feeling lonely in the wasteland
---
/ramitheasshole YTA
---
Melee character - lock on with Vats, and full run to the intended target, try to SWING!!! Annnnd no swing is carried out. 
---
Pretty embarrassing to be standing on the opponents boot laces, try and you may, and your character simply won‚Äôt swing. Argh.
---
It's honestly kinda silly that you can't if you're new to the game and think it's a survival game and not an MMO.
---
 You can see a Stealthed person with Chameleon Armor, just like you can see yourself. I can anyway, but its the fact that VATS won't work while Stealthed that's important. 
---
 Get a low visibility outfit as well as whatever Armor you are running.
---
You are, not sure they read that part. But it isn't full invisibility, though it can be damn close with multiple chameleon pieces and stealth boys. Like another poster said it was probably berry mentats. They've saved my ass a number of times.
---
I did, but wasnt at a camp. It was at my first railway station. I saw it and was like "Holy crap, someone left all this stuff? Why would they....well shit its mine now I guess."
---
Couldnt tell you what's so special but they sell for a gazillion caps. I've used a few pieces but I don't stand very often so the -15% damage while standing never worked for me.
---
risky and tidious (dont know if i spelled tidious correctly)
---
but yeah something like this i really think the solutions to this problem arent difficult at all
---
Oh, before everyone found out what a pile of shit the "server software" this game is running on is.
---
I wish it was a rust-like game honestly :c
---
It's strange because the sound just started? I think after the latest patch. I thought I broke something or something was about to break lol I was wondering if anyone else had this, thanks for posting.
---
Drop me awp
---
You have to actually go submit the ticket on their support site‚Ä¶
---
I'm not so sure it's a primary.  I've only ever seen cav/sent on 3* pieces. I have never seen a 1* sentinel piece.
---
I think sometimes the game names it that way though.
---
Yep same issue on my end as well. Xbox user.
---
nooooo i had that but sold it to a vendor.    :(
---
Yup melee/rifle here and melee is horrible in vats right now..rifle is better but not by damn much
---
They need to fix big issues like first time you vats and 95% accuracy, you still miss all the shots. This was fixed in 7, and broken again in 8. 
---
And charge up on a gauss rifle and then entering vats result in a miss. This can be fixed with charging up after entering vats, but if vats looses it target, you can't re-enter vats again because the shot will miss.
---
Of course I am. Why would I not care that he‚Äôs wasting his life on games? I‚Äôd rather he be out enjoying the world.
---
25% 50 would be op
---
Coughing and making breathing noises in your mic, shooting and hitting things also give you away, walking makes noise.  
---
I see lots of people thinking they are invisible. I just stand and wave at them lol. 
---
Most of them sound like a bull in a china shop.
---
&gt; way this "quest" has been set up is sooo stupid. How is it fun to scour the whole map hunting for a dead tourist which could spawn 
---
Thanks for the pic. I've bene there countless times and still nothing
---
Can't get a good 1 star weapon? Pffft please, my Bloodied The Dragon has a higher damage output than my TSE The Dragon, and that's a 1\* vs a 2\*.
---
Plus if you don't think 1 stars are good, why do you bother with those enemies? Lower levels do need to find a way to get up and starting, many people in the end game just started with a 1\* no matter what.
---
What I think more people are shouting at is that you may be one-shotting the enemy, which isn't fair on any other players. If I see any legendary, it being 1\* or 2\* or 3\*, i always signal people with the come here emote to show them so they can tag it.
---
Plus also one-shotting is kinda of a douche move, not only does it ruin the challenge aspect, it also makes the game waaaay to easy. I dunked my One-shot build for that purpose. I have tons, from TSE to AAE endgame weapons but I don't use them to their potential, cause hey there's no challenge in just clicking once, and I like a good challenge. My thoughts on it.
---
 VATS is evil and sucks anyway. ;)
---
 I find I lose no accuracy to my Twisted Muscles Mutation as I don't use VATS. With a 30%+ nerf on my gun accuracy I still get my headshots just fine. I can see no difference and may pull Class Freak. ;)
---
It would be cool for a melee only legendary it scale the power down some. 
---
Molerats and radscorpions just get a landmine to the knee and a jumping vats shot and they back off.
---
yeah but if its just a matter of motivation the balance is "ruined" already and they already have leveled gear that prevent you from creating a new character thats godlike from the start dont you think that would be enough?
---
Hahahah story of my life
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRaiufUMdWw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRaiufUMdWw)
---
you need to see this
---
Yeah, like you never did the same thing.
---
Back in lower levels I blasted this guy's fortress, gone through walls, used up all my ammo and explosives, oh the joy when the glorious chest has been found, quickly R Transfer all and run away laughing like a maniac. Then placed my own CAMP and behold, thee treasures be empty.
---
I've never felt dumber.
---
When the game was fully released, we were dealing with crashing every hour or less, sometimes the complete inability to play because of constant spam of the ‚Äúattempting to connect to server‚Äù message, getting disconnected every 20-30 minutes, losing items, limited stash space, duplication glitches, unfinished content, SHIT TONNES of other glitches that made the game a fucking chore to play. That‚Äôs all in a supposedly fully released game. That‚Äôs not ok and should be full on illegal. That would be iffy stuff even in an alpha game. We sure as fuck deserve something for sticking around after the crap they put us through.
---
Wait till he goes to store his new found riches in his emptied stash.
---
‚ÄúThe fuck? I‚Äôve been robbed!‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm on pc unfortunately.
---
High Perception + Berry Mentats. If he is looking in your direction with his character face (not camera direction) he can see you, your name even your point on the compass.
---
This and there is a large portion of the building that broke in the same patch.
---
No active object, the object cannot be placed, cant connect powerlines to the last object you placed without changing build mode and back. I can't think of them all but on PC I have to frequently change building/edit mode or completely leave building mode and back to manipulate some objects. I haven't seen a single post about these issues. 
---
I see this distance yellow texture or the rainbow textures at least once or twice a day here.
---
Yeah but rust is good for rust. I don't like the community in rust mostly. Which is kind of the point. At least in fallout 76 i make friends and we go do stuff. In rust i make friends 3 days later i wake up dead and looted.
---
First time I went to a station and saw the stash box I thought "that's a dumb place to put your stash" and emptied it. 
---
I soon figured out I was looting myself and felt like an idiot...
---
I havent actually. Mats are so easy to farm in this game. I hardly ever even play around others. Only doing the SBQ and I never take peoples bags.
---
I hope so
---
Yeah, they serve no purpose as of yet. Maybe we get to hire rooms as an alternative to our camps
---
I hope they do
---
Its an old bug but it checks out.
---
As great as it would be, I think it would ruin the games economy, because if that was the case, someone could just wip up a bunch of cheap weapons, make them legendary and sell them off, decreasing the value.
---
From my thinking, I think that the legendary vendor will just be a NPC where you can sell legendaries or scrap them for tokens and then re-roll legendary stats, but not specific ones, **all** of the ones on the weapon. This would be to prevent people just wipping up TSE's or BE's or AAE's off the bat, because then that would cause a huge balance issue.
---
It would be great if sheepsquatch weapons and Enclave armours were in the legendary pool, but alas they aren't.
---
But there does seem to be legendary PA pieces coming, so maybe the vendor will have pieces for sale, or let you put effects on the PA, because the only effects datamined were "Lighter" and "Unbreakable", which both don't sound like they'll have huge advantages in game.
---
yeah, i actually like how 76 ended up, but i do wish it was more survival based
---
A full set makes you almost invincible. It's the only way to survive 1000+ damage per hit cheese builds.
---
Thank you! Any way around this?
---
Yea no idea... I dont know ANYWHERE other then that lake north-west of hunterville... maybe gonna have to try and pull him that whole way
---
If someone is using berry mentors does that still give off a purple aura that anyone affected by it can see?
---
Yes we really need it like in wow because player vending isn‚Äôt that good it‚Äôs just a poor version of it ...
---
The auction house in wow is how it must be it‚Äôs way superior
---
I, for one, think your idea to nerf legendary weapons is terrible.
---
Calm down babe üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Most people don‚Äôt play the game 25 hours a day and are aware of the millions of shit bugs that plague the game. Your anger should be at Bethesda not at the lost souls who still play this game.
---
Queen negates 70% of damage right off the bat (pun). Then she has like 300 DR on top of that. So yeah, you need more than 3-4 people.
---
No, The problem is low level players who forget that the game is not a single player experience.
---
This might be the only sub where a comment like this gets downvoted.
---
I've only seen one is all my playing 2 100+ characters
---
Came across one on Tues at bog town, Xbox one. Been playing since Dec and it's the first one I saw
---
--close
---
What‚Äôs a high perception?
---
I am calm, I just happen to see how horrible their back end is because I'm currently helping create the private servers for the game. The current servers they have now are beyond garbage. They literally can only handle roughly 10 people max before they start to shit themselves. Diablo 2's servers could handle way more than these servers and it came out nearly 20+ years ago.
---
Yeah happens to me will lately don't know why
---
It's killing me because people are trying to say Twin Lakes and Solomon's Pond are 'guaranteed spawns'...
---
Oh, no what I mean is you would be able to get a non legendary piece and give it to the vendor for x tokens per star, and it would roll up legendary stats onto it randomly. Similar to rerolling, it would be random.
---
Crossbows and Sirynger need overhauls. Two of the most underspeced missed opportunity weapons in the game.
---
The Sirynger is a HUGE missed opportunity. It could be utilized in massive ways in upcoming endgame raids, medic builds, minion builds, condition applying builds, support builds giving momentary magazine and bobblehead buffs. 
---
It could apply, burning, poison, desease, bleeding, electrical damage, bobblehead perks with a 30-60 second duration, stimpacks, chems, pacify, animal friend, Momentary mutations. 
---
Could do Medic, mad scientists, ect. Such a sad missed opportunity. 
---
Oh yeah, and crossbows suck the way they are, but so do chainsaws.
---
I've done a few oopsies here and there, but the fact that the Stash Boxes aren't public property is definitely one of the more obvious things in early game. At least if you actually think about it for half a second, but I guess there's no time for that if your first and only instinct is to steal it and run.
---
Riiiiight
---
At times when you walk in to the old bog town ( workshop ) sometimes it‚Äôs either super greenies , scorched , bugs , or a behemoth and his minions ( super mutants and hounds all together )
---
Welcome to r/fo76
---
big oof
---
Yes you're totally right. Excerpts chainsaws I saw some heavy action with it
---
And you can see how much the vendor pays in the little details window in the trade window
---
Non-explosive GP is several levels below; but you should definitely try it out and check for yourself... It's just that I've been so spoiled by explosive exemplars everything else pales in comparison.
---
I've never seen one at either of these spots, but south of Solomans is a pond that I had a camp near, one definitely spawned there every time I walked to Whitesprings. Must've killed it 15 times at least.
---
But given the challenge I'm sure any spawn point is going to be overwhelmed.
---
"Just vendor it quick before he gets back"
---
The bow already is classified as a silenced weapon, since the Mr Sandman perk affects it's sneak damage.
---
 I do agree that it needs waaaay more mods. It could have better scopes, better bows and strings for increase range or damage. I feel armour penetration would fall down to the bolt itself, so maybe new types of bolts would be great, like poison tipped ones, armour pen. as you say, exploding/fire and more that can be just chosen by pressing a button to select which type to load in.
---
As great as the quad legendary is, I don't feel that the crossbow should get that effect, but maybe a mod that shoots multiple arrows at once would be good (not TS since that got nerfed, but a mod for the crossbow that allows to shoot three bolts at once at the cost of 3)
---
Are you looking right on twin lakes? If so, it's actually a bit west of that. If you open the map, it will be slightly west of the little mountain ridge next to twin lakes marker. It's a small pond where it will spawn at.
---
I got one to about 10% and it just flew around for 10 minutes doing nothing before it landed and I wrapped it up
---
Hmm I dont go there so did not know... i run around it all the time... I'll to start checking inside.. dont feel like dealing with whatever is inside, the SB, and whatever crap gets pulled towards it
---
 I run a pretty Stealthy build myself with 2 bits of Chameleon and all the Sneak perks. I love my Combat Knives far more than any other weapon so I am using my Stealth up close and personal. 
---
 Use the environment all the time. Hide behind anything, it will give your Stealth a small advantage that combined will make your Stealth a bit better. I can get my 2x Stealth hits on stuff that would see me if I was not behind them.
---
 Real people are gonna be much tougher and have Berry Mentats. Be sneaky, don't depend on your numbers.
---
I'm expecting it might work like "crafting" in Path of Exile. You can add one star, with a random legendary effect, to a normal or legendary item; or you can re-roll all effects. It'll likely cost more tokens to add stars to 1-star items, and cost even more to add stars to 2-star items.
---
Last time wad around the Nukashine quest release. Most I saw was a mass of 5 that spawned in on a workshop I had.
---
What do you mean? Troubleshooter weapons will do the extra % damage to the imposter sheepsquatch as it is a robot, but if you used a robot weapon like a assaultron blade or Mr Handy Buzzsaw, that won't give any extra damage.
---
That's why I use power armor
---
you can get it from raider vendors
---
Fallout is dead. Entirely. We haven‚Äôt had a proper Fallout game since 2011 and the last good one that Bethesda made was in 2008. So yes, I think it‚Äôs safe to say the identity of the series is so far gone from what it used to be that Fallout isn‚Äôt even the same Fallout anymore. *cries*
---
I know this is far left-field from your comment but just spewing some frustration. I would‚Äôve called my self a fanboy/super fan once, but this game is utter shit compared even to other mindless lootershooters (Destiny, Borderlands, etc.) Won‚Äôt ever forgive Bethesda for completely ruining my love for a franchise the way they did with Fallout.
---
Origin of Windigo
---
It's also interesting how the shitty, pointless outfits like this one from FO4 are now the rare, sought after ones in 76.
---
I saw a post a while back , someone glitched in new shop and turned an 1* into a 2* then a 3* same prefix ,.. so keep your 1* with prefix to prefer
---
I had 9 or 10 but then acquired herd mentality and lost all my other mutations trying to get rid of it , so far I only have twisted muscles and bird bones back
---
More like cancelable interactions during hp damage
---
I can down a lvl 80 SB w it without issue but it‚Äôs nowhere near effective as a heavy gun. 
---
And yeah, the bloodied Tesla dominates any chameleons I run into on survivor - oh, I can‚Äôt target you in vats? No worries, just blast in their general direction and watch them low non PA low energy resistance pvps get downed in at max two blasts
---
Yeah, I wish they would go ahead and monetize some of the Fo4 modders and let them put in some of the cool mods for F04. None that alter the actual game mechanics, but there are thousands of great mods they could work in, like smokeable cigarettes, some of the water mods, weather mods, power armor paint shop. ect.
---
Economy is already trash , caps are almost worthless,..
---
Yeah I've had this happen to me well was trying to loot and accidentally clicked the bed, I died though
---
Have a bloodied with 250 resistance asell. And it seems to happens okay when u unload a full clip I think. But yes it's a real bug that needs fixing.
---
yea mutations like that honestly suck even with class freak
---
This is very true. [**The Appalachian culture**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcqOKBF7fvM) is similar to [**the free state's**](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sam_Blackwell) in that they are constantly fighting against corruption to protect their community. That's why Sam Blackwell means a lot to some of us. The local governments only lobby for stuff that's not helping the community. 
---
Another example is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Elk_River_chemical_spill. It's still not a good idea to drink the tap water there. 
---
The free states were trying to take their land and lives back from corruption.
---
Straight stole my idea lmaoooo
---
Had the same, was post nuke, check the fauna
---
LOL Yes I just noticed this last night, it sounds like a piano dropped from a 10 story window!
---
I play mostly solo, so I wanted that shit out of there
---
Thanks,  will try now!
---
It's called Astroturf, from the Atom Shop.
---
I like this idea! It would level the playing field for a lot of situations and ‚Äújunk‚Äù legendaries useful.
---
Piano dropped from a 10 story window! lol
---
I've friended a lot of people even though I mostly play solo. Then I use the join friend option to switch between characters. No one has to stand around while I tediously Twink stuff and so far, despite many swaps, I've only ever had one"shipment" get lost and that was I think due to the server resetting not the fellow poster disconnecting or swapping servers during the 10-15 second time for me to get to the menu and back. 
---
I only lost one really good gun, but I'd had it since very early on, a beserker explosive 25 lvl lever action. A great gun for an early level player.
---
Link?
---
He protec, but he also attac.
---
Thanks for the tip. I‚Äôll try tonight.
---
Maybe Maybe, that could be how it does work, i'm not the one deciding XD But I do feel that it would have a impact on the general market for legendaries. Now, if the price for said X amount of tokens was really high(and by high I mean stupidly high, so lats say 100), and you only got a small amount for turning in legendaries(5-10), that could work for the games economy, since it won't mean someone spams super duper will making gauss rifles, makes them legendaries and then sells them off.
---
With the made up numbers, that would mean that to get to add/re-roll legendary effects, you would have to turn in 10 legendaries, which seems in some sense fair, since you have to take in mind the games in-game economy, and how much it has suffered from things like duping, so you can't over do it but make it to a degree a bit of a grind, but not too much.
---
"Hold *ACTION BUTTON* to *ACTION*"
---
Just this would solve a lot of inadvertent uses.
---
The one by twin lakes is the only one I've ever seen (xbox 900 hrs) just went and took a pic and got a mutant hound pic at huntersville, didn't work. I guess you have to get them in the same pic?
---
+1 for visibility
---
 you are on the same server as me lol
---
Mine was a few weeks ago
---
I have had this happen to many times at a few different events... but most recently an hr ago (xb1).. spent 1000s rounds of ammo on the damn thing... and got NOTHING for it... no xp, items, event items... nothing... it happens on a few different events but this and One Violent Night almost half of the time
---
Omg yes. I've done this event 3 times and twice I lead the cows all the way and didn't even get a shot on the Sheepsquatch
---
Hmm... I concur that definitely *part* of the difference in what we both experience comes down to the reloading mechanic being so different between my Handmade and your Pump... Since as you said, you can't exactly interrupt the reload process unless you fire a round or lower your weapon. (Admittedly, last night I had forgotten to test if the DR went away when lowering my weapon, but I can only assume it would.)
---
Then again, I now can't help but think that *just maybe* the fact mine *also* has the Quicker Reload Speed legendary effect may be having an impact on the +250DR mechanic. 
---
Either that or, as I also mentioned, it has something to do with my internet connection speeds. The reason I feel this may have an impact, despite the game seemingly having really really good netcode (not utilizing all that much bandwidth), comes down to using the new Camera. When I aim to take a picture at something within range, it usually takes a ***long*** time for the gray "identification box" (upper right) to display on what I'm looking at, and often will continue to display the last thing I looked at for probably up to 7 seconds. 
---
So my thinking when it comes to stuff like this, and the fact the game engine wasn't meant to do multiplayer... Our clients are doing half the tasks and the server is doing the other half, along with authenticating what the client is seeing/doing.   
---
In my case, like with the camera, it's:   
---
\-Me aiming and my computer sending the data packets to the server of what I'm looking at.   
---
\-Server then has to crunch those numbers and send it back to me  
---
\-ALL THE WHILE, the my game is still sending/receiving data packets because, well, I *am* playing and stuff continues to happen.  
---
\-My computer receives that and now needs to send back a small "acknowledgement" packet confirming arrival of server's info.  
---
\-Yet I'm *still* playing, which continues to need bandwidth...  
---
\-Due to all of this, latency is incurred between certain non-mission-critical (aka time-sensitive) game tasks and the delivery of the initial server data or my "acknowledgement" packet, ends up taking a perceivable amount of time instead of being basically instantaneous. IOW, it takes 5-10 seconds for that Identification Box to show up for me...
---
Ok, how this applies to the +250DR while Reloading? My guess is that it's perhaps my side's latency leaving my game either unable to promptly *send* the packet which states "Reload has finished, please return DR to normal", **or** it's my game not *receiving* the server packets saying "Reload confirmed, lowered your DR; reflect this in Pip and during combat". 
---
Unless a Bethesda Dev happens to weigh in here... all I can do is end this with a **\*shrug\*** :\\
---
Yeah i spent a good while looking for it on the lakes themselves too. Just start heading west and you'll eventually find the little pond right by the mountain ridge shown on map.
---
I have 3 life-saving pieces and maxed Savior, and I haven‚Äôt seen him yet. I need to try dying more.
---
Now if only I had a ProSnap ü§¶
---
what? I literally saw someone with a similiar name to yours.
---
 I have Twisted Muscles and I'm seeing no downside to my gun accuracy even without Class Freak. That must be a VATS thing and I don't use it. 
---
 I may pull Class Freak if it makes no difference. ;)
---
I‚Äôm not online right now?
---
The first time I invited someone over to see my camp, and they started looking through the stash box, I got REALLY nervous! I think we've all been there.
---
I don't mind searching for the hoard since you get a decent chunk of XP for searching each area. I generally get about 400 XP for each location (not including any XP bonuses).
---
Upvote for flying laser blenders.
---
lone wanderer rank 4 gang
---
 Wow, that's just gonna be next to impossible...
---
yep!!! someone gets it. :D
---
I found one at Bog Town but no Mutant Hound... damn!
---
I know, its a pain
---
It's a real shame the game isn't forthcoming with a lot of the lore. That's the weakness of no npc's to talk to. Then they barely expand on it.
---
Last week I saw a group of super mutants including a behemoth and hounds attacking the robots at the whitespring entrance opposite the train station. Not sure how often that group type spawns there though.
---
Adrenal reaction, carivore, grounded, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, and speed demon.
---
Even on non-bloodied builds, if you're running class freak that -12hp is worth getting adrenal. I run a heavy weapons and 40mm grenade launchers build.
---
Healing Factor
---
Speed Demon
---
Twisted Muscles
---
Talons
---
Marsupial
---
Carnivore
---
Your buddy is an asshole.
---
Weird, I have 270 somethin and the game wont let me pick up anymore
---
if you have max starched genes AND class freak, you‚Äôre really missing out if you don‚Äôt have other mutations (or you do and i misread)
---
are you on Xbox?
---
Hmm, don't really think this comes with not having NPCs. I mean, you had the obelisk at the Dunwich Building in FO3 and the related stuff at Dunwich Borers in 4. Besides it being there, they never really delve into it any further.
---
I play on PC.
---
Thank god I'm not the only one, I thought my graphics card was damaged somehow
---
I would like this just to get rid of all the perks I never use
---
I stored them all in my stash idk why xD
---
ah, one of the master race. i just have 150 40mm grenades i never use and nobody wants to take them. might just throw em out or give them away for free
---
Yeah if I don‚Äôt get a shot on something and it dies and even sometimes if I do there‚Äôs often no loot
---
The alien picture is glitch in the encrypted  challenge  and not doable apparently.
---
They can be hard to get rid of, I usually buy them for 3 caps each; but alas, my brother from another platform... I can't. Throw 'em in a train station or whitesprings, someone might find them.
---
I've got quite a few mutations running, maxed out class freak, not noticing anything bad so far.... Can't remember exactly what I have. I'm pretty sure it's these: marsupial, birdbones, healing factor, twisted muscles, scaly skin, eagle eyes, egghead, talons, and speedemon.
---
There is a watch tower that has planter boxes full of various veggies all the way up it. I was always a little unhappy that they are so obviously in the game, and we cannot build them ourselves. The planter boxes would be perfect.
---
I assumed it was like FO4 and you could leave stuff in any container and it would still be there l. Nope, lost all my stuff. Luckily I was low level.
---
It's a rare event
---
I‚Äôve been wondering about this too. Sadly I don‚Äôt have a correct answer.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen it explode once, but what I have seen a LOT lately is the dead body randomly has the shield back on, which makes it very hard to find.
---
How?
---
no afk time, all me playing. igot a level 208, 149, 77, 75, and 30
---
How do I do that? I was following the reddit guidelines that stated right on the homepage to fill it out like this.
---
Hopefully your comment was satire.
---
Probably snallygaster spit attack explosion, i have one. There are also behemoth slam explosion and behemoth stomp explosion, that seem to be a lot rarer
---
Sneak does nothing towards players tho.
---
If you want to diversify away from melee just a bit, you only need 6 perception. Take three 1* perks in commando or rifleman (depending on what you prefer) and Concentrated Fire. 
---
Concentrated headshots, especially sneaked, work as well as placing 9 perk points in damage perks and then going further with things like Tank Killer. You don‚Äôt _really_ need those perks, especially in pve.
---
No not at all. May seem that way to those who started with this last game but it‚Äôs not at all. Hate where Bethesda took this shit.
---
I've had a few instances of "Guess what? It's just a crown enemy, not even a legendary!" lately, too. Granted, it's only been in the Forest or Ash Heap, but it's always the "search 4 areas," which makes it a giant, time consuming, worthless pain in the ass. I don't even care that the legendary would be low-level, I can drop it off in Flatwoods and make somebody else happy.
---
Believe so, when fasnacht was up, some people would pop berry mentats and I could see everyone in the near area has that effect, even though I didn't take it. Same thing can happen with the Targeting HUD of PA. Whether it's a bug or not who knows...
---
I can totally tell you it isn‚Äôt.
---
LOL /u/SanshaXII didn't you 'rob' a few camps like this during beta?
---
You literally sound like one of the troglodytes from No Mutants Allowed.
---
COMMUNISM IS THE DEFINITION OF FAILURE.
---
An end game.
---
Pleasant valley check around armor benches. Small chance to get them from treasure maps in savage divide, mire, cranberry bog.
---
Ooo probably. Dunno how long it's been in the game, but nice spot! The world is huge and I bet I (and probably others) haven't found every nook and cranny there is!
---
Jesus Christ, I wish I had done to this to my friend who is new to the game üòÇüòÇ
---
Shotguns and melee both require you to be close to your target. Why use both? Pick something that gives you some range.
---
Rgn can be a b*tch sometimes sorry to hear
---
I think life saving triggers first, so you have to fire a lot for him to trigger.
---
If all you use is rifles I would recommend vats perks before bloody mess but that's just me
---
So be it. Not ashamed to say I was a huge fan of the series. Just voicing frustration. Yeah it‚Äôs beating a dead horse at this point but sometimes the posts from this sub that pop up on my feed are so fucking incomprehensibly stupid they force my hand in a way.
---
goto the water park put on some music irl and server hop i got it in 2 tries
---
Yeah, that happened to me too. I brought it up because it‚Äôs pretty solid way to know if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôre getting seen.
---
I had that in Watoga, robots just dropping dead as I walked by, no one else about. It was really weird.
---
How do we make these lens? I don't think I got a lens plan from that quest cuz there's no option to make one in the camera section of the tinkers bench
---
Haha, Devin is just the best.
---
Freezing it helps. Both fighting and finding it after.
---
Yeah hate it
---
didn't know that nice
---
Well it‚Äôs the same company that made the imposter sheepsquatch do more damage than the fucking SBQ the actual endgame boss. Now that I have everything from encryptid I don‚Äôt bother doing it. Stupid ass robot sheep Bitch smacks me twice IN MY POWER ARMOR &amp; I‚Äôm gone into dust... SBQ smacks the shit out of me &amp; I just pop a stim and keep hitting her lol. I popped 4 stim‚Äôs while the imposter squatch shot his beam at me. I couldn‚Äôt live still
---
I've told the story a couple times before but I had the opposite happen. Let a guy into my CAMP, he broke my generator then went to my Stash and I presume took everything out of it because he was carrying about 400lb of junk when I finally caught up to him and killed him.
---
Well i know it only because i check reddit before i buy something, but yeah :D
---
Too funny and too real! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thats bad, my wallhack wac actualy good.
---
Also did this my first time playing, was super exciting because I thought I found the holy grail of junk but it was only my own stash
---
There was another post talking about this, I‚Äôll link the post. It‚Äôs quite a read.
---
[I think this is the right one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhvz9d/guide_indepth_weapon_legendary_effect_mechanics/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
im on ps4 and I've had the same problem for some time now
---
Definitely a curious thing being displayed there...
---
While the changing of the damage on a Bloodied weapon is definitely weird, I can understand in that instance why a Bloodied with +250DR would cause it to reflect oddly after a reload, since it's changing a core aspect of a player's stats and has to recalculate stuff.
---
No, what I find curious in that all was that his damage WHILE SNEAKING did not change after a reload. Only when he was STANDING did it drop after a reload...
---
Though didn't you say that the weapon's primary effect gets removed after reloading? Which is what prompted the other replier's comment about his Instigating Lever Action (sorry, I'm replying for my Unread page), and me looking into that as well. 
---
However, in that vid, all of his as Bloodied Exploding, and after reloading, they ARE still exploding. 
---
Though I apologize I've misunderstood something here.
---
If the change is reflected in actual combat and isn't just a client-side visual anomaly (showing lower damage but still dealing what it should), that indeed sucks. 
---
At the end of the day, there's no denying that *something* is janky when it comes to Bloodied, in general. As I've noted as my health went down further, mine didn't "update" to reflect their increased damage until I re-equipped it. Yet that potentially goes back to my speculation of being internet connection related. 
---
It's anyone's guess at this point, due to how hacked-in Multiplayer is to this already hacked-together Creation Engine, which heavily re-written or not is ***still*** derived from the GameBryo engine... lol
---
That easy huh? Well heck, guess that's my afternoon
---
About 3 weeks ago , not gonna search , didn‚Äôt save it
---
How did you make it? I'd pay to learn how to make this.
---
The way i see it, in earlier fallouts and even elderscrolls there's always an npc that you can talk to about what's going on around the area you're in. Now we're just playing seek and find with holotapes.
---
I have 13 including herd mentality which is awesome since I only play in groups.
---
&gt; ‚ÄúMuH lEgEnDaRy DrOp RaTeS‚Äù and ‚ÄúFaRmInG‚Äù in a fucking Fallout game. Oh how far we have came.
---
This isn't a main series Fallout game. It's an MMO-lite fallout game. Of course it's going to have farming and drop rates. An online game without them is doomed to immediately fail.
---
Oddly enough, the values for magazine armor penetration are blanked in the ESM (like the hardened receiver bonus). They were 20 and 40% when I tested them a couple of months back, but you'd need to test again to be sure, or find where it's getting those numbers from.
---
Nope, still do it though so i can make some sense of my stash box.
---
Only Aluminum for some reason
---
Did this too
---
Hey, me too. I also have legendary trades.
---
It is still just aluminum and lead that benefit from bulking
---
hope the rng is your favor
---
Aha, makes sense, thanks.
---
Last I checked only aluminum and lead are worth bulking as it reduces their weight by 50%
---
There is one that increases weight but I'm not sure which
---
The main purpose of bulking is to make your junk sealable to vendirs
---
You are an actual idiot if you think Fallout was a small series before Fallout 4. I don‚Äôt usually resort to name-calling here on reddit. But that was some nuclear dumb shit I just read.
---
And really hope you‚Äôre not implying that Fallout 76 boosted the series. That would be double stupidity. What else should I expect from this sub and fans of this shit game, though?
---
"You can‚Äôt get a good one star, so what‚Äôs the point?" Exactly. So dont shoot it in the first place.
---
Ah the Chameleon armor part was not mentioned in your original post. In which case, your question has been answered by other people.
---
Are you saying they actually have their own physical server farm rather than hosting it on AWS or Azure and simply spinning up more as needed? If so, that's insane.
---
Yes, that makes sense.
---
I never use the arm pip-boy, just the HUD version, but i changed the colors just for the white flashlight option. It's like day and night on how much better it is with the white light.
---
Yes. Yes.
---
I was hoping there were other people using the plushes like this. I have mine set up on a picnic blanket on some astroturf, sitting around the smallest cooking station. Some day the tea party will be complete.
---
Nope and it‚Äôs something that has been heavily requested in the past.
---
Nope. I always equip the used ones and use those up first, but i also dont carry that many, i just go to Poseidon or one of the other fusion core workshops and get more when i run low.
---
I don‚Äôt know, but I hope so
---
You are correct, with some combinations it will name things oddly. The assassins effect will sometimes not be in the item name while being the primary effect, thus the secondary effect name takes over like poisoners (2¬∞ effect only).
---
Just pick an item (like a bobby pin)  and sell it to them even it shows zero, the bot should buy your item and show correct amount (1399). Happens to me all the time.
---
It doesn't matter what type you actually have, the horseman skins cosmetically over ride it. Like, if you had an Excavator and put Plague Walker on it will look like an X-01 but still have the stats of the Excavator.
---
Thanks Neighbour!
---
&gt;You are an actual idiot if you think Fallout was a small series before Fallout 4
---
4? Who said that? It was literally dead before Fallout 3.
---
Shadowed only works in dark areas, no?
---
If the other skins are like the Plague Rider you can actually put it on any power armor. It will change the models to the skin; so Plague Rider turns any PA into X-01 Plague Rider, but it retains the actual armors stats. EG: t-51b stays t-51b stays with the Plague Rider skin but appears as X-01 Plague Rider.
---
Every Mr Handy at Camp McClintock just dropped dead all at once for no reason.
---
that is some funny shit right there
---
I 100% remember this happening to me
---
Yes, there are paintjob like camo, or there are skins like plague.
---
Well, chances are that you will be able to apply War Rider to any armor and make it look like a T-45 PA...
---
It's working the same with plague. 
---
I actually love this feature, making a set of PA look like another set.
---
I wouldn't use a Tesla against something like a Scorchbeast.  There are more efficient weapons for that, and the beam doesn't travel very far (and is very difficult to judge when you fire it into the air).
---
The "trick" to the Tesla is that you can bounce it off surfaces.  So, rather than aim directly at an enemy, you're better placing your shot at a point between multiple enemies so they all get zapped.  And likewise, if there's something that needs line-of-sight to attack you (like those obnoxious incendiary turrets), no problem.  Just deflect the shot off a wall and you'll connect with it.
---
Unfortunately, it doesn't always work against the wall/ceiling mounted turrets.  Bethesda made some kind of hamfisted compromise there, likely to prevent the player from VATS'ing through the surface.
---
They can not be traded.
---
Apparently ull be able to put them on all the power armor types regardless of which skin it is. Just get which ever one u like most and put it on a set ull use. That way it's the best of both worlds I guess. I'm disappointed with the system they're using for it
---
Thanks all. Was hoping to get some more mileage out of my stash box even though they increased the stash limit.
---
He's part of one of the four (five?) mini quests that came out with the squatch update. Go to the taxidermy store and inspect the little notes that are tacked to the bulletin board in the office to start the rest of them. They only take 20-30 minutes each, but there's some cool little rewards.
---
I have her on PS4 right now at the palace of the winding path. Username is Timdiv362
---
I have never been to No Mutants Allowed clown. Not sure why you keep clinging to that. I just love a game that is now shit and laughed at by the masses. That is all.
---
Eh I can tank imposter and take no dmg from the melee. The beam melts me pretty good however. The fight certainly needs work though. Also 2000 caps for a chance at a 3 star with a sometimes unbeatable timer depending on group sucks.
---
 (Sentinel+blocker+lone wanderer makes melee do nothing)
---
I wonder if you had healing factor, tool the pylons and ran to the edge of the event you could heal thru it.
---
There should be some way to counter the pylons at least partially. Also the timer is super short imo.
---
I run a Tesla build and legacy or not a TSE Tesla is worthless for use.  The strength of the Tesla comes from the arcing and the explosive removes the arc changing into to any other explosive weapon.  At that point it‚Äôs more beneficial to go with a TSE shotgun.  But there are those that will hear legacy weapon and jump on it and give you their console for it
---
If a friend completes the quest while in a group with you you can get another. Honestly kinda surprising.
---
Recently I‚Äôve had this happen as well. Mobs will be acting normal then suddenly make their death noise and are dead. 
---
Robots have always died on their own, very noticeable in the Enclave bunker. I assume they have a programmed life-span or are just poorly manufactured.
---
Alright dude. Fallout 1 and 2 definitely sold way more and had way more fans than fallout 3 and 4 did.
---
Fallout 4 definitely did not make the series way more mainstream and bring in more new fans than any other entry in the series.
---
I love denying facts.
---
Noticed the same thing - have a usual round of cap stashes I farm; haven‚Äôt reset in at least three days. 
---
One of the main reasons I found myself starting to login regularly again is gone.
---
I play as a somewhat-Bloodied character and I would say that Barbarian probably isn't worth it.  As you face higher-level enemies, you'll find some of them have armor penetrating abilities that render DR/ER moot.  As a result, a lot of players spend their points on flat damage reduction perks like Serendipity (flat chance to avoid incoming damage), Dodgy (nerf incoming damage by x% at the cost of AP), Lone Wanderer (x% nerf to *all* damage), and sometimes Blocker (x% nerf to all incoming melee damage).
---
Between these, I'm more survivable at 40% health and 260 DR/ER than I was running Vanguard at 400+ DR/ER.
---
I didn't know the exact figures for the explosive effect, thanks üòé
---
There are much more imposible challenges :(
---
Most times when u cant find it, the deceased body is cloaked. Keep your eyes pealed for blurry shapes.
---
must be Xbox's day to be F'ed up, I had a hell of a time trying to play yesterday on PC but this morning all is OKish
---
I think I'm going to go with the Pale Rider for t51 just beacuse I use T-51 more than X-01 now. My X-01 which has the Mothman paint  is more of "climb up that steep mountain" PA for it's jetpack, and my T-51 is my "get down and dirty" PA.
---
Also you've only have one suit of PA? Man I've got 7! XD
---
Really? Doesn't that sound like a bug that they would fix in the future though?
---
Yeah I've been noticing this as well, 95% chance shit will consistently miss with no reason. Usually on my two shot and furious lever action rifles. My whole build is vats critical so kinda important!
---
Gaming has grown. No doubt Fallout 4 brought new fans in. Not sure what your point is? I‚Äôm a believer in logic.
---
If you‚Äôre implying that Bethesda is happy with where the community is at now, vs. where it was in 2010-2015, you‚Äôre insane. But I know you wouldn‚Äôt imply such a thing.
---
This made me laugh way harder than it should.
---
Did u remember wjat the title was like I searched vendor and didn't see it. Would it be in ur history? Srry just curious and wanna read it lol
---
The difference between the x01 and the t51b is comparable to having maxed out the iron clad perk. When your trying to min/max a tank you can't scoff at at an extra 50 dmg resistance. 
---
Getting an x01 helm for the special head mod might be worth loosing a little resistance for tho.
---
Lol I was level 10 and shotgun offed a door and raided my own stash! Lol took me and 2 calibers of bullets before I realized!
---
Out of curiosity, have you tried going through the motions that originally started some of them?  I didn't have Ecological Balance for the longest time (since launch, actually), but after I went back to the trailer and investigated the terminal, I've had it pretty much everyday for the last month.
---
when your sneaking, you shouldnt show up on someone else's berry mentats, unless they changed it
---
I will help
---
Mine generally isn't in the distance, but directly under me. It does go away, but not too quickly in most cases. 
---
Sometimes it's only-some-ground-texture which is weaving above/below a normally appearing ground texture right where I'm at. Sometimes it's just a distance LOD ground texture and near my is fine. Sometimes there's a "savage divide" (lol a clearly defined line) where the glitching texture meets normal texture. 
---
Given how heavily I've tweaked my INI, I just assumed it was that, up until a couple days ago when I saw someone else's post. However, since there are *so many other* immersion-breaking hiccups in the game (like all the Z-Fighting building textures or specifically the street-name signs in Watoga, and the innumerable *floating* piles of rubble/refuse) that I just haven't bothered to try resetting the INIs to fix. I'd rather have my overall-visually-pleasing graphics vs not and the issue fixed. :P 
---
I suspect, like lots of visual issues after patches, that they've changed some code in the Shader and caused this latest herp-derp. I DO still have Patch 7's Shader Archive that I could try loading the game with, but I suspect it'll fail SHA check and prevent the game from loading.
---
No fix at the moment. I can hear the humming on the Camera too. It kinda sucks! Hopefully they will patch it soon.
---
I wasn't there, I can't explain you exactly what caused it. But you don't get killed out of nowhere.
---
I am also waiting for an answer. I know i got the plans but where can i craft the lens?
---
sounds reasonable im not into pvp at all but i have an instigating and a furious teslarifle i might try out next time thanks for the infos
---
PVP in other shooting games is totally fun and healthy, but in Fo76 it‚Äôs very toxic because of the way they set it up. They use victims‚Äô caps and junks as incentive to get people to murder each other. And how do you do it? You buy some duped magic armor and OP weapons and stand very still or hop like a bunny to become unkillable. It doesn‚Äôt get dumber than this.
---
That's a good suggestion.
---
The other day, it died in the pond and there was seemingly no visible corpse.  Very obnoxious.  I just kept an eye on where other players were gathering and doing their ritualistic staring-at-the-ground.  If you do find it, make sure you gesture Come Here! üòÇ
---
I'm level 119 but I have barely used power armor because I'm a stealth build so it doesn't really hold a lot of importance to me. I only crafted a suit for fighting the queen because I desperately needed core assembly and the increased carry weight. 
---
I'm starting to find myself in situations where I want to use my power armor for the extra carry weight but I don't want it to get dinged up for when I go to fight sbq. That's why I'm working on the second set lol
---
I found the behemoth at Solomon‚Äôs pond (poor guy with a shoppin cart stuck to his bum) but where is a hound and a behemoth together??
---
It was very cool, I was on my main (a maxed out tse guass rifle stealth build) and he didn't  find me. I was right in front of him but never did I go full danger, just caution. I also got a skull and a few quills, just need to do the actual event now and get some plans lol
---
Exactly. COD FFA and Battlefield are the only other games I play atm, all pvp and zero toxicity.
---
But a gang has people in it!! What am I to do?!
---
Same. Xbox. Melee and rifle build. Been happening again since the encrypted patch.
---
I hide them in random places because I'm embarrassed.
---
The individual sources of armor penetration are multiplicative, but because the formula depends on the ratio of damage to DR, the effect of each AP source can be considered separately. AA (50% DR) is always +29% damage, Tank Killer (36% DR) is always +15% damage and Perforating (40% DR) is always 17% damage, regardless of which of them you stack.
---
The exception is that if DR falls below damage/6.5, there is no further benefit. Even given that information, I'm struggling to think of any practical situation where you'd drop perk cards.
---
Excellent. I had forgotten. Was same in FO4
---
Booo
---
cool! so the answer is keep it equipped if you want the benefit of the slower damage rate to the PA. Ty!
---
Or lose some weight!
---
it's the rapture
---
For Play Time I've talked to Chloe, I've tried the Huntmaster at Black Bear Lodge, and I've tried the terminal that starts queen of the hunt. No luck tho I'm afraid.
---
Can't add you, because your setting. 
---
Psn: chlebostrom
---
I want nuke SBQ on your server later.
---
Thank you so much!!! Server hopped for way too long yesterday with no luck :P
---
Oh yeah lol sorry forgot to change it
---
I did half of the coments. Was so happy when i found someone camp stash... I took  it like Ahahahahha. Find a red rocket station a stashbox like WooHoo i need all of this stuff..... Gets to own c.a.m.p. Goes to stash. Sees..its....empty...sees box type... Than it clicks. Universal stash. 
---
Oh man the good old beta days.
---
It I worth you doing it so I do not have to after stealing it all from you.
---
Yep, no luck.. guess I'm giving up...
---
World full on queue,hold on xD
---
When games do not have proper systems in place to obey limits (i.e can't go below 0, can't go above 100, etc) you can have overflow or underflow errors. These will usually end up displaying the highest possible value that the system can render. Think of it like how in a (good) name entry or text chat menu, if you press left while on the left edge, it will take you to the right corner. It's the same case except with the lower and higher limits of a number range.
---
For example, there was a glitch in the original pokemon red game where a formula used for required xp to level up could be abused. Since you could not naturally get a level 0 or level 1 pokemon, the formula created a negative xp requirement for certain xp tiers at those levels. If you used glitches to get a pokemon at that level, and you earned a very small amount of exp, it applied it to that negative requirement and the game experienced an underflow error, telling itself that what you actually earned was 16777162 xp, enough to level up to 100 immediately.
---
I did more money selling two skeleton costumes than taking all those legendaries and selling them 1 by 1 a d try to not selling my items in the process
---
Looks like a variant of the glow...
---
Playing While High 100/100 achievement won!
---
 I bought Plague Rider as it fits my X0-1.
---
While it wouldn't surprise me if Bethesda went back on a direct statement they made again, would you care to provide me any source(s) for that?
---
I believe it is intentional specifically for the Four Horsemen of the Post Apocalypse skins.
---
I often wondered why people are buying good energy weapons for PVP. If there‚Äôs no AA effect how do you use them to take down those in sent-ass armors?
---
When I did it when it launched I encountered 0 legendaries. Was just a waste of time
---
Yeah not defensive just a tame mole rat or somthing just to make a house a home
---
I haven't seen any mention of explosive tesla rifles since then, I'm pretty sure they just forgot about it on the list since it also seems to have been affected by the change
---
Very nice, 2 thumbs up.
---
Ahhh so you've trekked the path I once went down. I'm level 241, and my build was a pure stealth sniper build, never used PA, only for nuke zones and maybe just intense battles.
---
I started having to hop into excavator because my stash was filled to the brim with legendaries and I was encumbered with all my rifles, and then since that day I'm sitting at 514/555 in Excavator PA, trying to get out of it but the game keeps yeeting worthy legendaries at me (may have a hording problem as well XD).
---
I just started to build more and more PA sets for different purposes, I have a Protocol'd Optimized and calibrated T-51, stealth boy X-01, Jet pack X-01, AP regen T-45 (I can run forever if I'm not encumbered) and a good ol anti-melee Excavator (You gonna hit me with a 1398 damage gauntlet, hah kill me and my Reactive plated will kill your puny bloodied build with reflecting 50% back at you).
---
Moral of the story, don't get used to extra carry weight in PA XD
---
A couple months ago I found that Brotherhood Camo underarmor like the one you see commonly on the bodies in Harper's Ferry --which is actually where I got it from-- but since I both keep every type of clothing I don't have yet, I wouldn't have thrown it away or vendored it. However, I did give it to my friend and she was wearing it last time I saw, so \*thumbs up emote\* :D
---
She really wants that Leather Coat, or preferably the Leather Traveler's Coat, though. Yet to come across those, even though I see about 15 corpses a day wearing them :( Pretty sure with all the Industrial Abraxo still around, she'd be fine if it came from a corpse since she could wash it lol
---
But either way, lucky you! High-five for not junking it ;)
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Safe zone
---
I emptied the Red Rocket stash and fast traveled to my camp and put it in my stash 3 times in a row without realizing it.
---
Tfw it was yours all along
---
They said it was balanced for 2 lvl 50 characters. I soloed it no sweat at lvl 28. How is that not a massive letdown?
---
I'm pretty sure this happened to everyone the first time lol
---
This world is mega full. But finaly it let me in. Haha
---
I'm on a much older xbox, so I thought maybe it was an incompatibility. But all these people have it too so it's a Bethesda thing certainly.
---
*cracks knuckles*
---
I'm at 147 here
---
Tinkerers workbench
---
Any tips for shooting them down?
---
Still on queue ; ;
---
It's at the tinkerers work bench you mod the camera like you do a gun there.
---
I think it‚Äôs in the tinker bench under camera, if you‚Äôve learned the plan
---
And make sure you do the Modify command on it, you didn't used to be able to do that.
---
If you have the plans, you can mod the camera in the tinker's workbench (the one that is also used to craft ammunition and bulked materials).
---
I refuse now after being tag teamed by two players that I didn‚Äôt realize were playing together. One needed junk and I‚Äôm always willing to drop for people. But she wanted to join a team and trade which I thought was strange. I loaded all of my junk...ALL of it. As soon as I did, she engaged in pvp with the other player who then proceeded to kill me. Luckily I had the last laugh. I had lightning fast reflexes standing next to a stash box and managed to transfer it all back. I watched as they beat my dead corpse with such satisfaction knowing they got nothing. Haven‚Äôt agreed to a trade since.
---
Yup, getting that on first loading up on PC when server hopping at Charleston and starting to get super FPS loss at the Bunker near Production vendors; never before this patch.
---
Ffs I agree, it‚Äôs god awful

Tagged for reference later

hope you don't mind, added to "[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 8.5 | 04/22/209 (Wild Appalachia)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhalgb/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_85/)"
---
Random encounter probably. Kinda cool but more than likely it doesn't lead anywhere.
---
Sorry to be a PIA, but have you cleared all diseases and re-aquired it?
---
not even hitting close to 250 (more like 50, as I'm running 3 or 4 accounts on one PC)... but I'll see if it helps.
---
Why? I think it makes more sense. The black rider and war rider skins have a lot of detail that looks specific to those armor types. 
---
Imagine if Bethesda designed a skin that looked better on T-45 than on X-01 well then there would be outrage, even tho it fits on all PA it‚Äôs not the same and people who don‚Äôt own a certain set will get mad. 
---
This way you get exactly what you pay for no matter what. I get why people don‚Äôt like it but at the same time this is the best option, I think in the long term Bethesda figured less people would be mad this way.
---
You still there?
---
Grape mentats
---
"Oh well, good thing I got all this new shit from that other guy's stash!"
---
Repeat forever.
---
I've never seen a more pretentious piece of shit lmao.
---
As if you don't understand a sandbox looter shooter's purpose. What's the purpose of playing literally any video game? Fun.
---
I could see implementing this robot, but i feel like 1 card for a random card wouldnt be right. It could be abused too easily, people would just keep trading the same card over and over until they get something they want.  Maybe trade 2 cards for 1 random, that way it cant be abused.  Or have the 1to1 trade be on some kind of timer, or a specific limit of trades per day.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect an answer but got less. Have a good one!
---
The second time I ever played I played with someone else in a team. I saw their stash in their camp and poked through to see what they had. I told them they had a nice stash and promised I wouldn‚Äôt steal from them. And I kept my word, I took nothing. I did dump my stuff in there when she told me that it was my stuff in there lol
---
You can, by bulking stuff and then selling it. Watoga station has a tinker bench beside the vendor bot for super easy decision making. Was always the intent of bulking, is the only way to sell most of the junk types, and is the reason Plastic is the most in demand of the common materials.
---
I get a bit enraged when you can see their every breath on the party overlay but they insist I should just turn my volume down.
---
The burrows and white springs is good for legendaries, vault tech university and the surrounding area are good for exp do to large amounts of glowing ones not many legendaries, there are a couple farms that are great for flux.
---
You are a wonderful helpful person, thank you.  
---
Enclave scum.
---
How is that not an answer?
---
The only reason anyone on Earth plays a video game is for fun. They are entertainment.
---
What other reason would someone play a game? Dumbass
---
Yep
---
Got it thank you, also i tried to bring a mutsnt hound from wet tek all the way to solomon pond near the behemoth but it wont come lol
---
Commando does not affect heaving weapons.
---
You need the stabilized perk under intelligence if you do not have it. +accuracy and +armor penetration in power armor. You're gimping yourself if you don't have this and aren't using PA w/ heavies.
---
Thx both of you. Got to go
---
It‚Äôs annoying but not as annoying as the guy two days ago blasting music while we all were fighting the SBQ. I took the time during the fight to eventually mute him.
---
Will she ever land? That's been my beef for a while.
---
Use a big gun. Vats crits to the flight control module.
---
Awesome! I just loaded in to the clubhouse. Where‚Äôs he at exactly?
---
Yeah from a min max perspective that 50 DR matters, but the vast majority of players don't min max like that.
---
Awwww man! That sucks. Thanks dude.
---
You pvp or pve?
---
&gt;... I'm struggling to think of any practical situation where you'd drop perk cards.  
---
Thinking how different it would be to run three points of armour penetration vs three points of glow sight in a nuke zone.
---
&gt;Awesome! I just loaded in to the clubhouse. Where‚Äôs he at exactly?
---
on the car in front of the main entrance. It varies by world, so he might not be there for you, but I can invite you to mine
---
Bringing up your Pipboy also cancels the animation
---
Cool, so my plasma gatling will do?
---
Drops from events in the mire. Problem is mire events almost never spawn.
---
Because the events that reward them almost never spawn.
---
This made me laugh so much
---
I did this at someone ‚Äòs CAMP near Overseer‚Äôs but didn‚Äôt have mine at the moment. I‚Äôm still wondering if it would have been my starter pack after setting up own CAMP.
---
Fair enough. But that‚Äôs not my argument. I‚Äôm not saying you cannot have fun with Fallout 76, or that it is inherently wrong. What I am saying is that this game is miles below any other game from the series and is doing more harm than good. But it‚Äôs obvious we disagree so let‚Äôs not get into that.
---
The purpose of a modern looter-shooter, or atleast the purpose in the developers eyes is to keep people playing for as much time as possible, by any means possible. Are we forgetting about the ghost nerfs? Haven‚Äôt they done that like 10 times or something? 
---
I had fun for about 20-40 hours until I realized I was essentially playing a cyclic numbers game. You could argue that that‚Äôs just how MMO-like games are, but I‚Äôve yet to play an MMO with less depth than Fallout 76.
---
Yep. Red Rocket in Flatwoods.
---
Alright, thank you though!
---
Okay thanks, I'm pretty low on fusion cores and not that high level, are there any places that have fusion cores that aren't too dangerous? I'm level 35
---
Eh problem with that gun is it's really inaccurate so you will have a hard time hitting it in the air. Maybe if you have the rifle barrel and beam focuser.
---
Okay. Thank you! Do you happen to know what perks I need to make an efficient heavy weapons build?
---
I've done this event only twice... it was ok... and like you say, I only needed to tag him. and the drops were shit. 
---
Then I ran into the 3\* Legendary 80+ facker wandering around by himself in the Mire not once, but three times... once in the Bog outside of Watoga and even once up at Rosie's dome... and that was a challenge.. I definitely cannot solo him. 
---
Much more satisfying taking him on in the open world... no event needed and surprise!! Much better loot when you let him do his thing.   :D
---
SsSSsHHHHhhHHhHhhhHH!!!! DON'T ASK THEM THAT, *ARE YOU CRAZY!?!*
---
lol Srsly though, I'm 99.75% certain this is why the Protectron's were 'blacklisted' and no longer are Legendary in Watoga. Someone datamined that as they're now flagged with something like "DoNotSpawnLegendary", and I suspect that's because every couple days there was a post complaining *"Can you please stop the legendary robots in Watoga from exploding after killing them?"* as lots had been killing them through melee/unarmed, therefore were immediately welcomed with a death-inducing-explosion. (Personally, I just learned to use a Hardened Lever-action and shoot them from behind twice, which further helped finding a Troubleshooters version; usually never exploded then \*shrug\*)  
---
Hopefully it's just a temporary measure while they try to sort out preventing that. It wouldn't be so bad if they had that charging-up noise hinting that "hey something's wrong and shit is about to hit the fan, so.... maybe run?" lol But that'd also require them not to *instantly* explode on death-by-Melee :P
---
I feel your pain though, honestly. He died while cloaked last night, but thankfully everyone crowding around it caused me to see it. What's weird, though, was three of us were "marking" and it was in *three different spots* for us.  
---
While actually-clipping through the terrain probably won't help out, someone recently posted the helpful tip that you can use the new Camera to help locate the corpse *(also that for challenges, the corpses seem to count for photo objectives)*. It may end up allowing you to find a 'sweet spot' for where it is that you're able to loot it.
---
Is a minigun better?
---
Also beware that if someone owns a workshop, and there is a locked container in it, even if they themselves didn't lock it or anything, say it's just a normal spawn type deal, if you pick it, you're wanted
---
Thanks for the warning
---
Oof shame it didn't pay off
---
Imagines me a little bit of the Mr Handy walking mongrel random encounter lol
---
I think i will try my luck at bog town when i'm on again later.
---
&gt;this game is miles below any other game from the series and is doing more harm than good. 
---
Considering the game isn't supposed to be a main series game is purposefully made to be **not** like the other games because it's a spin-off-like MMO, anyone that is comparing this game to the single player ones at this point is a fucking moron.
---
&gt;I had fun for about 20-40 hours until I realized I was essentially playing a cyclic numbers game.
---
that's a wide fucking range right there. Just say you played for 40 hours. So you played this game for 40 hours before you realised you didn't like it? That makes you sound pretty stupid.
---
&gt;You could argue that that‚Äôs just how MMO-like games are
---
That's exactly how MMO-like games are. Thanks for countering your own argument.
---
 &gt;but I‚Äôve yet to play an MMO with less depth than Fallout 76.
---
Probably because Fallout 76 is not an MMO. It's an MMO-lite.
---
I'm really, really having a hard time believing you are **not** from No Mutants Allowed. The way you talk about Fallout is exactly like those braindead idiots. 
---
I feel like you're lying.
---
Not really, from the "heavy guns" I know Gatling is fairly accurate. Maybe the .50 or LMG. 
---
I personally use rifles like the handmade or combat rifle because they are really accurate at long range. 
---
Could use like a dragon, black powder, Gauss if you're not an auto build.
---
that's a bug with the excavator one. plague is advertised as being applicable to every PA.
---
Handmades aren't automatic are they?
---
Awe :( I wanna shoot super fertilizer robots
---
They can be
---
you can get automatic receivers for them
---
I have a bloodied lmg so is that alright?
---
I was using hunting rifle, than gauss, now hardened handmade. More shots you can fire = more farming. With handmade i must farm still. I cant even do SBQ. It is crazy or i am noob
---
Generally you're better off dropping the last three 5% Rifleman cards before Tank Killer.
---
Because the Rifleman perks stack additively, the last three cards increase damage by slightly less than Tank Killer, and you don't get the stagger.
---
i havent tried but as far as i can tell automatic weapons work extremely well when combining stealth and vats crits 
---
i do run a build that uses a 10mm submachinegun that i really like i love its asthetics and the dps is respectable however it burns through ammo fucking fast
---
It took to the last minute yesterday for us to take her down. I was shocked we killed her lol she kept running away while on the ground, she would run far. It's been tough lately to get her down but harder to kill her..
---
Yeah probably your best bet as a heavy. Especially with bloodied, those bots take a lot of dmg. Get low hp, pop some chems and you'll drop it pretty quick.
---
Just fam sheepsquatch (4stimpack and 4radaway each) or SBQ (8? Superstimpacks each time)
---
No but you can bulk materials and sell them for a good price. Good way to get some extra storage in the stash and make some caps at the same time.
---
Cool, thanks man
---
I'm about to go on a 5 month break. Summer and all. Gotta get my sunshine.
---
I only use them when I do the remain vigilant quests.  Did one today and somehow got a chinese officer's sword in it.  Seem's a little silly.
---
Alright , thanks everyone !
---
Thanks for the input so far, but i tried all these things multiple times, and nothing works.
---
Bethesda, please fix your game...
---
Haha also a good idea
---
I was super close to some scorched and had 95% chance and missed a ton of shots. I was using my lever action.
---
At level 35, you can easily claim the workshop at Posiedon's energy plant and run the fusion core processor. It requires 100 energy though. So you either want to be able to build a fusion generator or several large generators. You could also run the event if it pops up and the power boxes will provide some power after you fix the power plant. You should also be able to do this pretty easily as level 35
---
&gt;braindead
---
Ironic reading that with some of the other things you said in the same comment. 
---
‚ÄúITs nOt A mAiN SeRiEs GaMe‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs a deader horse than the one I‚Äôm beating now. It has the name Fallout on it. It was $60. There is no argument to be made here. Like at all. Never understood this one.  
---
And yes, I played close to 40 hours, not a long time at all for a game as massive as Fallout 76. 
---
I won‚Äôt even address the other things you said because I really don‚Äôt know how. Just reread my comment. I literally said MMO-like the sentence before the one you quoted. You even tried to call me out on the same sentence... lol English is hard I guess. It seems like you‚Äôre almost arguing with yourself or something. 
---
Anyways back to topic have you played any other fallout games?
---
No, I mean the software they are using is garbage, unoptimized trash that I am honestly unsure how a triple A company even thought this level of instability and under preforming was acceptable to release.
---
Landed plenty of times for our group, but the invincibility thing really spoils the event
---
Here is my personal build: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f374e3a&amp;d=sq0s32sr2s01e52ep1c71cr0ip2ic4a72lu2l71id0pq1pa0s22sw2e40e10ib4ls2lt1&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=2389cef
---
Stabilized and the heavy gunner perks are most critical. Bandolier and gunsmith for ammo and keeping condition up longer. The rest of my personal build is for my grenade launcher damage and quality of life. I run 2 3* heavy gunner perks and 1 1*; gives 50% more heavy weapon damage versus 60% with all 3 at 3*, but lets me be more flexible in my strength perks.
---
Wish we had that luck. When SBQ became invincible, it spoiled the party for us.
---
Is your hand made auto or not? If it's not then you have the wrong perks active. Might be the reason it's not hitting like it should.
---
Here's a little barter tip if you didn't know, I found out the hard way. My idea was to take grape mentats and then inhale some x-cell. Took the mentats first, looked at the prices, then took the x-cell. Looked back at the prices, and the x-cell cancelled out the mentats! I mean were talking about a 600 cap difference on something that was originally 4,600 caps. I couldn't find any info on this so I hope this helps someone and they dont make the same mistake I did.
---
Finding them for sale would even be hard and the fact that you really need two even makes it that much more hard to come by. I think Bethesda either removed these spawns or severely nerfed the chances of getting them.
---
If she recharged a few times then yes, I have fought her a bunch off times and it just recharhes health once per fight.
---
I‚Äôm using a standard auto receiver with 3 ranks of commando (3 different cards, 30% total) and max rank ground pounder
---
Random encounter, confirmed.
---
Not a quest.
---
I found one also really early in my game, right after release.
---
Todd I wish.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs a deader horse than the one I‚Äôm beating now. It has the name Fallout on it. It was $60. There is no argument to be made here. Like at all. Never understood this one. 
---
Other than the fact they said it wasn't a main game and it's being worked on by a different sub studio.
---
&gt;And yes, I pushed through close to 40 hours, not a long time at all for a game as massive as Fallout 76. i have hundreds of hours in each of the their Fallout games.
---
How the fuck can you play any game for 40 hours without knowing whether you like it or not? 40 fucking hours.
---
&gt;Anyways back to topic have you played any other fallout games?
---
Yep. Literally all of them. Save for Brotherhood of Steel and Tactics.
---
I fail to see how it's relevant though. Or actually I do, because you Fallout elitists always bring it up whenever you can't think of an argument. "duuurrr i bet u only play fallout 4 and never see the MASTERPIECES that are the old games, otherwise you'd also be parroting my braindead comments".
---
If nothing else make it worth 7600 atoms.
---
Then I would have to ask, what kind off handmade it is, aa/ts/tse...ect?
---
Automatic is like: PEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEW
---
non automatic is: Pew...pew...pew..pew.
---
It's either been bugged since launch or there is something else that needs to be done to make it complete. I and many, many others (dare we say ALL players) have the same issue as you.
---
The quest isn‚Äôt done yet so no you can‚Äôt finish it
---
I normally be a camp near a scene. I've made it a point to put a stash box that fits the scene nearby.
---
Like if there's a broken down truck, with a couple tools and a skeleton, I'll drop a toolbox stash box next to the truck.
---
I don't see what you're getting at. We already know there's a quest linked to it but it's not in game atm. 
---
I was just making a guess as to when it will be a playable quest, same as the wiki page.
---
Also can't vats enemies in PvP of the names aren't red yet.
---
This is more so for people who are around LVL 30 and can‚Äôt attack those higher level creatures
---
Consider yourself lucky. A few weeks ago as a level 40 something, I ran into a level 95 3 star legendary behemoth. My poor character literally never saw him coming. It was like I spawned right in on him and he one shot me :P
---
But on a more serious note, like I just said, I see them here and there at Bog Town. I believe they are usually just east or northeast of it. I think typically they are part of the enemies needing cleared to claim the workshop
---
TSE. been looking to trade it for a different 2* handmade but no luck
---
No worries, despite my opinion being same as his, he is presenting it like a real douche and you should ignore.
---
That would be Heart of the Swamp, Irrational Fear, and sometimes It's A Trap, right? Assume won't drop on any of the Encalve events too, right? What about the workshop events?
---
Invisible? That's not good. There's been a few times we didn't kill her it's tough but there will be a next time. The times you do kill her make up for the times you didnt.
---
I am confused.  We already can build 3 different water purification systems besides the water filter (which I still can't build at level 71).
---
they should implement a section in the men√π like it is for diablo or even Fifa
---
What am i supposed to do now?
---
Make a looking for group post: xbox button , left left, down down, a
---
average market price is 1000 caps each or sometimes 1500 for a set of two. Dont waste your time server hopping for them. Over 800 hrs here and at least 30 of them spent hopping for jetpack and calibrated x01 mods to no avail. thats 30 hrs ill never get back
---
You're welcome. Sadly, I had the misfortune of becoming wanted at this dude's workshop. He pulled an explosive rifle out and lit me up like a Christmas tree. Lmao
---
Nothing for that quest. Wait for them to come out with the end of it.
---
I never said he was wrong, I just wanted to know if it was the real reason, because at first he was saying it was because a U.S. law, and that wasnt true. I simply wanted to know if this was something he knew for a fact, or if it was just a possibility he thought of.
---
And Bethesda still haven't fixed it? Wow... I hope somebody has talked to them about this.
---
I'm on PC
---
Ah ok. I've just always used mine non auto. Guess I never considered being able to mod it to auto
---
They have a set limit for server stability. Its not like they're doing it to make it harder for us
---
Also, don‚Äôt fucking eat with your mic on!
---
There‚Äôs nothing worse than listening to someone chew their food right in your ear.
---
Done this so many times myself.
---
I‚Äôm not an elitist, I really don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting that from. It just seems like you haven‚Äôt played the others and the whole ‚ÄúGo BaCk To No MutAnTs AlLoWEeD‚Äù is something I see on here quite a bit from those who have some weird nerdy vengeance against those who prefer the older games to this dumpster fire. Check mark in that box.
---
And I think you‚Äôre misunderstanding. I played Fallout 76 for around 40 hours and THAT is when the little fun I was having started to wear off. There‚Äôs probably not a franchise on earth I adore more than Fallout (maybe TES, Star Wars) so not giving it **atleast** 40 hours would‚Äôve been sacrilege to myself. 40 hours really isn‚Äôt a lot of time with a BGS game, like at all. 
---
And stop with the ‚Äúnot a main game shit‚Äù. That is such a non argument. I won‚Äôt even acknowledge that nonsense anymore.
---
Actually Poseidon isnt that tough, it will require a fusion core generator to,run it tho, just make sure to lock it
---
Not sure about enclave, there are a few more quests though. Chloes quest in Berkeley, The quest from Boomer, The one at Red Rocket I think is technically mire, queen of the hunt, always vigilant, possibly the new free range that spawns in mire, and also possibly the messenger when it spawns in mire, someone reported getting it from that event.
---
I tried bringing a hound from hunterville to the lake but at some point in the middle it didn't want to follow me anymore. No matter the aggro
---
The limit is based on items and stackable items count as one item. I believe anyway, but someone can correct me if I am wrong.
---
Make sure to use highest damage receiver, usually hardened automatic. Also use mods like stabilized stock, stabilized long barrel and suppressor to keep the recoil to a minimum to ensure a guarunteed higher dps than non-automatic.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3748b8&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22sx2ee2c72ic4ip2a72a42a04l71ls2pe2lt2eh2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=cf
---
a heavy weapons build i personally used for a while that works just fine as others pointed out already the stabilized perks rely on power armor but are worth it (energy weapons seem not to bee aeffected however) also you should invest perk points into super duper and ammosmith that you switch when crafting ammo obviously
---
all in all heavy weapons work really well if you can maintain the ammo 
---
consider using or at least having a good gatling gun or harpoon gun as they are really efficient on ammo
---
Yeah. That makes sense now that I think about it. But do you think maybe you're just used to melting stuff with a high rate of fire so that's why it seems pretty crappy? Or does it legitimately seem off somehow?
---
Or tell them to take the mic out of their mouth....
---
Ok so check flatwoods, there is tone of medic suply boxes.
---
You get a plan that you have to read from your inventory (I think) then you can craft it in the modify section not the craft section
---
Robots dont mutate so even if you could it would just me a fertile soil + cost of a shitton of radaway
---
You can look around here and on the Bethesda forums to see if anything official was ever said about it. I never saw anything official from Bethesda about this issue so I'm not sure if it's already being looked into or if it's a forgotten topic.
---
My bad. Ignore that last comment. I was thinking you switched the other way. Lol. I'm not really sure. I would think going auto would help kill stuff quicker honestly (assuming you had the same amount of perks geared towards autos as non autos)

I did a write up of the journey from the vault to flatwoods and the agricultural center. You can hit up about 26 first aid or chem boxes, various food items are left out as well. IT takes about 15 minutes tops to do the run once you memorize every boxes location. I'm level 141 and do it daily and I'm sitting on about 200 stimpacks and various other aid. I never run out.
---
This bug was in FO4...
---
Best idea around.

[A skin for the excavator PA](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/1h0QtApJYl0uF9D8p1hKDV/85f15ca9e55508e1c295331f8049ed70/Fallout76_ATX_BoneRaiderPA_1920x1080.jpg)
---
Erm, they nerfed explosive weapons.
---
The cry from users was such that they were overpowered when used in conjunction with perks.
---
Also, it appears to be the Devs and publics opinion that weapons should be relatively the same in effectiveness. If not then theres the calls of "x is overpowered".  
---
If Beth allows all weapons to be relatively equal, then more players will play longer.    This in turn increases sales, which is the corporate goal.
---
I'm not of that opinion and am perfectly fine with weapon classes being stronger than others.  It's natural, but I'm an old infantry and PnP gamer, so my opinion is probably in the minority.
---
Grumbly Rumbly.
---
I wish theyd let us put a depleted one in our camp fusion generators and let it recharge over like 12 hours or so.
---
It's not twin lakes or solomon. It's a no name lake in the vicinity of them, south east of the vantage. And there's noone else around for miles. I have no clue hotlw to bring a hound there.
---
I think it would be a cool mechanic if we had our absolute stash space and the. An alternate stash with extra weight but open so anyone can take it.
---
Exactly why I do it as well. I wish everything bulked because it's all named un-alphabetically. Bulking helps me keep track way better and I can sell on the fly if I need to.
---
I know i did two ‚Äò4.‚Äôs can‚Äôt turn back time!
---
Same, except it was the Encryptid event and it was fucking Tenacious D of all the bullshit to subject people to, also it was a survival server so hearing is a lot more important.
---
The Sheepsquatch has replaced the ScorchBeast as my favorite monster model in FO76.... for now.
---
They nerfed TSE and that was most definitely needed. 
---
I am all for equality in terms of weapons, but I suppose that was my point. They are not equal. They fire the slowest, do less DPS, weight the most, require the most perks, and have the heaviest and most expensive ammo. I want equality and that is not even close to existing.
---
Shit is priceless
---
&gt;And I think you‚Äôre misunderstanding. I played Fallout 76 for around 40 hours and THAT is when the little fun I was having started to wear off. 
---
&gt;. 40 hours really isn‚Äôt a lot of time with a BGS game, like at all. 
---
&gt;And stop with the ‚Äúnot a main game‚Äù shit. That is such a non argument.
---
It's literally the most valid argument here. You say you usually play for hundreds of hours in BGS games. Which are all singleplayer. 
---
**This game** is the **first** time they've tried something new. It 100% is not a main series game. It isn't traditional. It isn't similar in any way whatsoever.
---
It's 100% obvious to anyone with a brain that you simply don't like online looter games. I don't see how you can be that stupid to not notice that.
---
"Uh well I played this single player fallout game with content catered to one player for hundreds of hours. But for some reason I DON'T KNOW WHY, I just can't enjoy this ONLINE fallout game with MMO STYLE CONTENT the same way"
---
Use your fucking brain.
---
best location i can think of that might have both would be between bog town and the pylon.. around the bench area there is usually a behemoth that spawns back there with a squad of super mutants, ive never paid enough attention to the group to remember if there were hounds with em or not but usually where there are super mutants there are hounds.
---
I read this, and it's as if I should've written this myself. I cannot for the life of me kite them close enough to eachother, not even kite them to a place, kill one of them and then bring up the other one. Getting kind of pissed off, and I would just +1 on loving to hear if anyone knows how to complete this god-forsaken challenge.
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification re explosives.
---
Also all the cups with straws give 1 plastic.. its a lot of junk put you can walk out of there with almost 100 plastic
---
this is the only reason I bulk.. to sell...
---
The wooden barn doors are the whitewashed wooden one and the 2 red bathroom ones, they are in the regular door menu.

---
as far as i know the problem people had was never with explosive weapons like the rocket launcher but with the explosive effect on certain weapons
---
and yes i really think the same way they break after five minutes the maintenance is extremely costly and even worse the guns seem to completely loose their damage output on bigher creatures ( behemoth, mirelurkqueen, scorched beasts) their only usable for clearing out mobs of ghouls or scorched if you are able to maintain their condition and ammo
---
dont bother with energy weapons unless you have an grandfathered explosive one.  I would recommend melee or automatic rifle for people just starting out. unless you have a godly energy weapon you will be putting yourself through a rough time leveling up.
---
Thank you. Will try it out
---
I'm level 26 and I haven't mutated once, how much radiation do you have to get to mutate?
---
I‚Äôd really like for Bethesda to add more tattoos ,I think it would be cool to create my own faction emblem and paint it onto armor and is it to much to ask for some tiki torches for my camp .
---
your best bet is waiting till you unlock the starched genes perk and buying a serum on reddit
---
I got a bloodied vats Crit crossbow with prime receiver and it is definitely fun to use. But yeah, needs customization and probably has the lowest DPS of any weapon in the game with a min/max build. It seems to be broken in vats as well
---
Boo fucking hoo.
---
Okay thanks I'll check it out
---
I'm 90% sure you can't use the rug glitch with plants anymore
---
Is the furious Gatling gun lvl 50
---
I don't think so. That barn is just way too clean and sectional to not be player built, and I feel like if I've spent enough time in the cranberry bog outside of Watoga that I would've noticed the pristine and decorated barn just outside the city. But if you can find it in-game, let me know.

Fallout 76 is literally Fallout 4 but:
---
- No NPCs
---
- No Dialogue
---
- No towns
---
- No random encounters
---
- but with friends :)
---
And you‚Äôre trying to tell me it‚Äôs different. Yeah it‚Äôs different. It‚Äôs the same damn Fallout game with **so** much stripped and one little feature added: multiplayer.
---
Again, if you can give me any other differences I would be glad to be proven wrong. But I know you can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. Use **your ** fucking brain, clown.
---
Runescape trading? I feel like that would work
---
probably 5k to 8k  
---
make a looking for group post and watch the offers roll in: xbox button, left left down down a
---
Thank you for the quick reply
---
 LOL. Straight to Wallace for that lot. I sold him an Level 35 Instigating Laser Gatling Gun yesterday. ;0
---
&gt;Fallout 76 is literally Fallout 4 but:
---
&gt;No NPCs
---
False.
---
&gt;No dialogue 
---
&gt;No towns
---
&gt;No random encounters
---
You said you played this game for 40 hours. Was that a lie???
---
If it has to be both, that's bullshit. What a pain in the ass.
---
Same problem, the behemoth just stops at some point and the hound just reset...
---
I completed this challenge earlier today.
---
I kited a mutant hound from Huntersville to the Pond South-ish of Solomon's pond where the behemoth is. You may need to server hop Huntersville because it doesn't always have hounds. My hound was near the fast travel point walking with a super mutant.
---
The hound decided to leash/give up pursuit near the pond. I killed it before it could run away further. I exploded it's body (i'd unequip bloody mess btw) down the hill towards the pond because the behemoth doesn't seem to kite very well, and dead creatures still count for photo challenges. I then proceeded to take a lot of photographs of the behemoth killing me while trying to get the game to realize they were both in the picture (which is when both their names show up in the top righthand area.)
---
I don't know if this is the best spot, but this is how I did it. The fact that corpses count may be useful elsewhere anyway if you find a better location.
---
You‚Äôll want to sell all those to a vendor. The only half way decent was the furious Gatling gun, the allrise is pretty beastly but it‚Äôs a quest reward and everyone can get it
---
Braxton‚Äôs quality medical supplies in the mire. Found one there during a rad storm
---
I spent my first 100 levels trying to make automatic weapons work. I liked the look of the new 10mm SMG and really wanted to use one end game. My advice: don't. I spent large amounts of time having to learn where to farm ore and acid just to be able to go out and use my SMG for short bursts before my ammo ran out again. I even got mocked by people on here for asking where to get more steel. Yes, it is all over the damn place, but I could *never* get enough to keep more than 200-300 rounds in my inventory, and forget doing the SBQ. Hell, Scorchbeasts in general were such ammo sinks I just ran or server hopped. I've migrated to rifles and melee now and the game feels playable again.
---
its not an issue or a bug, the quest is not finished yet. there will be updates and extensions onto it in future updates and a likely possibility that the questline may never actually end since they are wanting this game to go on for years we may be chasing her all around WV and back again.
---
there is also more going on in the game than just the scorched issue, the plant issue in the mire will more than likely be tied into the overseers questline as well when that vault opens up.   
---
side quests, missions, events, leveling up, farming resources and supplies are still a huge part of the game so there is still plenty to do outside of just her main story line.
---
I know but some people might have gotten a lvl 45 or just dont know how to get it
---
 You don't need two. One works fine.
---
SBQ?
---
I honestly would like it and I‚Äôm on PS4 but I‚Äôm too lazy to do the quest :P
---
Oh wow. Steeping this low. Are you the same guy having a brain aneurism a few months ago saying that the traveling Mutant merchant and Rose were ‚ÄútEcHnIcAlLy ‚Äú NPCs. Yeah they are. But you and I both know what I mean by traditional NPCs. If I wanted to chat with a toddler I‚Äôd apply at a daycare. Let‚Äôs not argue on the technicality or vocabulary... Jesus Christ.
---
This is going nowhere. Have fun with your drop rates friend.
---
Second. Economy was healthier with dupers
---
Oh, I thought I missed a skin for Raider PA.
---
wish i knew that before sinking 6 levels into their perks but i suppose im not the first. thanks for the tip :)
---
 Oh thou of little faith. I got a Jet Pack after about 60 visits and I picked up a Calibrated Shock in that process. As I walked from the Mire, for many of those visits, 30 hours is nothing. ;)
---
I can sell it for like 300 caps I really don't want it
---
Damn, I'm Xbox
---
You know what, let‚Äôs get together and I‚Äôll give you some 3* I have maxed out my carry weight and box weight and I‚Äôd love to get rid of some
---
Yeah, they could be useful at times to get around
---
Sure wherever.
---
Sure?
---
Glitches shouldn't be the solution to thier lazy prohibitive  C.A.M.P.S
---
Oh modify! Duh
---
System?
---
..of _COURSE_! Explosions! You are _BRILLIANT_! Thank you for this, going to go do this right away lol.
---
&gt;Yeah they are. But you and I both know what I mean by traditional NPCs.
---
What the fuck is a "traditional" NPC? There's only one definition of an NPC. A non-player character. Grahm and Rose aren't "technically" NPCs. They are **literally** NPCs.
---
Two is better than one.
---
Whats your psn
---
Add me, psn: chlebostrom.
---
Hopefuly i have egouth ammo haha.
---
Ps4!

If you're lucky. In the forest region, he seems to travel quickly and consistently and all the enemies are low level. In the ash heap, the terrain seems to be make him stop constantly, and for 10 seconds at a time. I haven't really done his event in the savage divide, so no comment on that. In the mire and cranberry bog though, the terrain is constantly screwing with him, and he seems to be attracting EVERY enemy within a 100 mile radius. I've had one time in the cranberry bog where he somehow attracted a large group of ghouls, then a large group of scroched, then mirelurks, a mirelurk queen, a scorchbeasts, several insects, and then a pack of mongrals. And all of that was before we even hit the main road where there were a few molerats, robots, and 2 scrochbeasts that he kept focusing on and staring at for a good 30 seconds at a time (thankfully didn't have to kill those scorchbeasts). Then I had to kill several supermutants and ghouls once we got to the abandoned bog town where he delivered his message. 
---
FUCK the messenger quest.
---
Anyone get the staff yet? Would like to have it for collection if possible.
---
A nice Handmade with the Powerful Automatic receiver hits about 55. The Hardened one is around 75 or so. With the 85 round Magazine the Handmade is very good indeed as an automatic weapon. ;)
---
I can do that. Let‚Äôs meet later tonight PM me please
---
NPCs that have actual ducking depth not just ‚ÄúI sell things‚Äù and ‚ÄúI lead a faction that nobody is a member of‚Äù
---
Jesus, I see how you find the game so enjoyable with standards as low as yours.
---
But again: please explain how Fallout 76 is groundbreaking and Bethesda hasn‚Äôt done anything like it before without bringing up anything to do with Multiplayer.
---
Try fast traveling to the different spawn locations, or wavy willards seems to be a good place to server hop. Or try and find someone on your console who has one of the tourists, and join them
---
Ok send
---
Yep I did it too thinking it was someone else's stash lol.
---
How much I‚Äôm looking for a decent Gatling gun
---
My cult loves tea parties if you are ever in need of some guests!
---
1.5k
---
&gt;NPCs that have actual ducking depth not just ‚ÄúI sell things‚Äù and ‚ÄúI lead a faction that nobody is a member of‚Äù
---
Those are also NPCs. A mole rat is an NPC. Rose is an NPC. A deathclaw is an NPC.
---
&gt;But again: please explain how Fallout 76 is groundbreaking and Bethesda hasn‚Äôt done anything like it before without bringing up anything to do with Multiplayer.
---
Where did I say fallout 76 was groundbreaking?
---
And "Please explain how it's different BUT WITHOUT MENTIONING THE BIGGEST FUCKING THING THAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT"
---
You're a fucking idiot lol
---
It is classified as a Rifle, so yes Rifleman and Tank Killer are viable perk cards. 
---
It is not a "laser weapon" even though it uses "energy" ammo, it's damage is still ballistic damage
---
Alright I‚Äôll be on in an hour or two
---
I was like that back in beta, had my stash hidden with a turret and punji boards around it even. One day I got into a pvp encounter (I was hunting a bounty) and ended up in a 1v3 fight (and was winning might I add) and whenever they were respawning I would rush in and steal the stuff from their stash. About an hour later I learned you can't steal from people's stashes and I was laughing my ass off.
---
Somebody warned me of the same so I actually did know and did it anyway. :[ I guess I just didn't want it to be true. I think having played the hell out of 4 and seeing shiny, new automatics that didn't look like the absurd assault rifle piqued my interest. For what it's worth I'm keeping my Perfect Storm in hopes they eventually make automatics viable.
---
Damn. I missed it üò≠
---
Sure my psn is temmie953 txt me when u get on
---
Did you go to the giant teacup location. I didn't even have to server hop and found it on my first try.
---
Keep trying.  I had been looking for him since Friday and just found him this morning.
---
Originally I wasn't server hopping but rather jumping on one server and doing a circuit of the expected spawn sites.  This morning I switched to staying at one site and hopping servers.  Took me about an hour but he popped up on the bench at Colonel Kelly Monument.  XBOX.
---
No it's fine where power armor tho
---
My new CAMP is still in Area I, south of the Vault; it‚Äôs on the cliffs between the pharmaceutical plant and the donut shop, just down the road from Suttonville. There‚Äôs a No Trespassing sign, but it‚Äôs for decoration only. Feel free to use my resources!
---
Ok
---
I keep it on and I've repaired my x-01 once in the last month playing consistently
---
Try different monuments. I recommend Colonel Kelly Monument near the north central.
---
Nah we knew it was same stash. We just stole food and water, and those materials machines at workshops.
---
Probably just took to much time to create a fake one
---
No they were awful
---
Psn maxpowers_69
---
So energey weapons are only good late game. Thanks
---
Good luck! I'm grinding West-Tek right now realizing there are hounds here too, perhaps more often. Don't know if there's a good kite path from here but it might be another spot to try if Huntersville doesn't work out.
---
Even after his response you have the same people still trying to destroy his channel. Videos still being uploaded on something Oxhorn did a decade ago.
---
I've got to be honest - I kinda' don't.
---
The reason why is because the local map was often difficult to interpret, especially as dungeons offered more tiers to explore, and it gave the dungeon designers a crutch for making things maze-like.  "You have a map, what more do you want?"
---
Without a map, they are forced to make designs that have more of a natural flow.  A mine in 76 always trends downward from the entrance, and it's logical to always seek the path leading up if you want to leave.  You don't end up with circuitous form-over-function nonsense like the Institute interior.
---
He's PS4, boys :)
---
You're basically redownloading the whole game; most archives it seems have been updated over time, so you need to download the whole thing. You should get space back from this; the install size shouldn't be 100GB in the end.
---
I just tried doing this. The hound started running back halfway to the first pond, I killed it, and started exploding it towards the behemoth. It disappeared in thin air halfway there :(
---
[AKTUASLLY THERE ARE NPCS‚Äù](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/191/035/135.png) 
---
Ok let‚Äôs change the vocab since you don‚Äôt seem to be able to comprehend context clues at a damn 2nd grade level. It‚Äôs fucking OBVIOUS people aren‚Äôt referring to the rats and various things you kill in the game. That‚Äôs literally an argument over the English language. I‚Äôm not interested in arguing over two different things. Get on the same page, please.
---
You literally said Fallout 76 was groundbreaking for Bethesda and they had never done anything remotely close to it before. I‚Äôm saying that Fallout 76 is almost a carbon copy of Fallout 4 but with a lot stripped away and multiplayer added. I just want to see what you come up with at this point.
---
 I made about 300 5.56 yesterday, did not even dent my stash. ;) I use it, like all my weapons, to funnel enemies onto my Knives. ;)
---
The damage figure on a shotgun is split between pellets so I was thinking that if only one pellet hits a target with full health it'll only do 2 pellet's worth of damage.
---
It would be nice if it did full damage if even only one pellet hit the target.
---
I did that for a good hour when i first started the game.... Would find stash boxes in red rockets, think i scored big, walk all the way back my own camp overweighted and find my own stash box emptied thinking someone cleared me out.
---
This. It's some kind of glitch
---
The vantage doesn't spawn muties as far as i know,same for solomon lake. You can't base a challenge over something that has impossible odds. Specific events are rare but they happen. Thr behemoth at bog town is too random for example.
---
i mean it seems like something made from someone who doesn't play the game.
---
True. Did not say this place is new, just wanted to point it out, in case it is related to the upcoming patch.
---
Did not expect a fresh new suggestion, good job, have an upvote
---
Maybe it's just a little joke, like, we can track down the real sheep that turned into the Sheepsquatch! =]]]
---
You have to reload the single action revolver and lever action rifle 4x as much for their quad reload animations too.
---
300 is nothing mate. I said I used to not be able to keep more than that, that's because I would craft 1200-1400 10mm for my SMG, pick a fight with a Mirelurk King or a Wendigo, or just go golfing at the Whitespring, and all of a sudden I'm almost out again... Except now I'm out of mining spots or acid
---
No glitch, just the odd way Bethesda uses archive files to store everything from textures to sounds. Rather than updating an index file and downloading individual resources that are needed after the update, a single whole file gets downloaded. Not an inherently bad system, but presents particular inconveniences for console users, since the packages are more consolidated than on PC.
---
OP story is very relatable. Funny to admit but I think we all did this early in the game. I did it back during the Betain October on XB1. Went to a train station, saw a fellow 76er occupied at the vendor, emptied out the stash box next to him not knowing what it was, then ran for my life b/c I thought I just robbed a 7-11. I wanted to give it back but didn't know how to use my pip boy. lmao.
---
I can relate! I‚Äôm in tears laughing at this.
---
I finally ended too my pvp build on 2 character which is my 2nd character. The medic is the third.  And I have leveled up my mule on another account just for him to share demolition expert or serendipity, 2 lvl more to concentrated fire. That will be perfect for group of 3 pvp/pve. Or solo pvp
---
Moving on. See y'all next time. :)
---
Wasteful, but probably more foolproof in the long run.
---
Or, for ease of use, discoverable plans that allow you to craft 10/20/40 for a single better tape. That tape would do the same as you suggested, but gives an added goal. Maybe the plans could be Enclave rewards as well.
---
I'd like to melt some queens too.
---
Add DemWafflez
---
Prob got it from the games code or a mod I know a YouTuber who used kids for fo76 ( to get rid of all radios but still a mod)
---
They are really conspicuous, aren't they?
---
since new year?  a lot got fixed, some new little stuff.  how it should have been at launch really!
---
LOL. A Wendigo dies to my knives very fast. I did a level 50 Mirelurk Queen the other day with my non Legendary Serrated Combat Knife. 
---
 The SMG is a joke, always was although anything can be used if you really want. The Automatic Handmade is a serious gun.
---
 The Whitespring I kinda avoid after people got upset after I pulled out my Nocturbal 40% Speed 3* Combat Knife. It melts ghouls so fast no one gets a hit and Its very hard to do it any other way. ;)
---
Just had one Behemoth at bog town but only with Supermutants and not a single hound, unlucky...
---
I agree it would be much faster than the buyer declining options until a price is met
---
So a thousand steel scrap has the weight of one? (0.1?) yeah of course you‚Äôd be happy with that, you‚Äôd save hundreds of pounds. Wouldn‚Äôt make much sense, and I would hold your breath.
---
Just marsupial, adrenal reaction, scaly skin and chameleon, I had speed demon but the extra eating and drinking needed were not worth the speed and re-load buffs it provided to me so I scrubbed it off. Just having these ones means I don‚Äôt need class freak and can spend the points on something else.
---
How do you use your other account to share perks. Doesn't the other character die if you don't feed or water them. That is pretty ingenious sharing the perks that way
---
couple questions: did you use an auto grenade-launcher? I feel perhaps this one is needed because it can get the job quickly, also: did you loot the hound before you started exploding it? I think if you don't loot it perhaps the corpse will exist for a longer period of time. I haven't tried all this out yet as I just remembered the double xp ends before the challenge does, so gonna squeeze all the xp-juice out before restarting my frustrating adventure to complete this challenge :P
---
you mean like the imposter assaultron head weapon from the atom shop? XD yea they have this weird issue with not doing things in ways that make sense. they also dont seem to do a lot of testing on things before pushing them.
---
Got it, thanks. You're right though, I'm not seeing a lot of those events pop anymore.
---
Yeah I think you're right, it's the spit attack....I had no idea about the behemoth though that's pretty cool. I know they're not really "items" but they still must be pretty rare haha.
---
Also I just learned I can't post very often because I now have negative Karma in this sub, back to lurking I guess...
---
Rank for what? Difficulty? Enjoyment? Gear?
---
I‚Äôve noticed this small detail but it could be a massive coincidence, if you look at the quest Personal Matters‚Äô cover art and then compare with the ‚ÄúNew Main Quest‚Äù badge on the Wastelanders DLC roadmap you can see that the silhouettes running in the distance are the Vault Boy and the Overseer, so my theory is we either meet the Overseer finally or just that her quest finishes with that DLC

---
What you like the most.
---
Okay...  This is unrelated but your excessive winky faces give me the creeps. :S Sorry.
---
Yes I have tons of these and no desire to use them currently
---
Maybe they could be a effect giver like food does. Put in some money and it gives you +1 to a certain stat for an hour.
---
Someone said it's better to fast travel spawn locations on the same server. You could search this sub for the locales and try it.
---
Used an explosive 50cal and no I didn't loot it. I thought the exact same thing but no luck
---
I know this event *can* be a pain in the ass when people don't know what to do, but I feel like it's easy enough and happens often enough to say these are very common and not worth much.
---
Thanks. He doesn't die. Just no AP and very low health. But if he dies, it's better, the perks sharing still function. And for disconnecting... Lol rubber band between the sticks and pipboy for not him moving
---
Way back in the day I sold a TSE shotgun I got from SBQ to a robo-vendor for a pittance.
---
About 300 so far...
---
I was at about 160, and I dumped all of them onto a low level who stumbled upon my camp.
---
are you in r/fo76filthycasuals ? They would love this story
---
*Laughs in Mothman merch*
---
wish they were a real faction though...
---
Thanks, I thought this piece was rare like the sheep hide piece I‚Äôll just give it to a vendor then, thanks for the info
---
 The wink is conspiratorial and is to defray any bad feelings my often confrontational posts generate. Only one in the last post and if that's creeping you out ... I'm pleased. ;)
---
Same for the ticket machines at train stations, what do they do
---
36 but havent played since December
---
Why the fuck am i over encumbered by 209 lbs? Oh, i have ammosmith instead on of thru hiker
---
 Downvoted for facts. ;)
---
i dump mine in flatwoods spots 5-10 in each storage container i run across, i wont ever use em (unless they start dropping something worth farmin these things) so better to help a low level out with weapons, ammo, junk, and the xp of going and calling it.
---
I use Gunsmith and have the opposite problem, my ultracite laser or automatic laser rifle last much longer than my black powder pistol or Dragon. I use Weapon Artisan too, maybe try those. I hardly ever need to repair weapons anymore.
---
I guess that means the Fatman is also considered an unarmed weapon.
---
I think it's a little too loud, personally.
---
And I've done it like 60 times, and I'm tired of getting meat pies because people don't kill the Sheepsquatch fast enough.  Have one or two people protect the cows, the others focus fire on the  Sheepsquatch. The event ends shortly after the sheepsquatch is dead, even if the cows are still being attacked.
---
Do not whine that people are killing the squatch faster than you  can "tag" it.
---
You say that as if Sheepsquatch is just a "reused" model. More than likely, new models are exactly why that update isn't hitting until fall. (And also, I'm sure they could find a way to recycle models for Kentucky too.)
---
And gold would be insignificant if they didn't slap it right on their roadmap that they themselves posted.
---
Take a look at the Wastelanders updates. Tons of gold spilling out of a vault door, and a couple Vault Dwellers running off with some. Kentucky is literally right next to West Virginia, and Fort Knox is known for having a ton of gold. (Wikipedia claims it's estimated to be 2.3% of all gold ever refined.) It's also been a fairly popular target for fictional robberies for that exact reason, so why would Bethesda just ignore it despite it being within walking distance of the current map?
---
On top of that, the Wastelanders update teases a "new main quest". Why would they not develop new locations for a new main quest?
---
I just assumed it was the opposite TBH. It comes off like snark.
---
It‚Äôs glitched, the bad side effect makes it not worth having, I got rid of it.
---
And red dead had cigarette smoking
---
How are you on that mission
---
If it's useful info- I was able to kite it nearly to the road that leads down to the pond, and I was on that downhill slope. So the distance I had to cover with explosives wasn't huge. I used an explosive shotgun and i didn't shoot it directly, I shot the ground near it to push it along. 
---
And yeah, I think tossing corpses around may be buggy but I gave up server hopping bog town and this worked out OK for me when I tried it. No comment on if these challenges are well designed.
---
I always put my extra plans in the Overseer's cache at Flatwoods Church. Hopefully I'm not the only one lol
---
Forest, savage divine, toxic valley, mire, bog, ash heap
---
You could probably get more for it than at a vendor if you try. I'm sure there are people who really want the set but haven't been lucky. I just wouldn't personally ask for more than 100 caps.
---
By the way the metal stairs stack effortlessly without a glitch
---
I used one this week to summon a cargobot to complete the take pictures of robots challenge, don't think I bothered to take anything from the actual drop because it was garbage.
---
Pretty much any Raider vendor aside from the Whitesprings one will say it.
---
Complaint on a appreciation post, I feel it ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ill didnt have the camera on me. Ill take it next time the event occurs.
---
Is the tattoo on your arm from the legend of zelda?
---
I give them away for free to friends who don't play the game as much. I think they're worth hanging onto because they weigh almost nothing, they're super cute, and you can squad up in your lil sheepie costumes.
---
Keep trying workshop takeover sometimes include behemoth ensure you‚Äôre high level to spawn higher level enemies
---
In a nutshell.  There're two sheepsquatch ones a robot and then a real one. Robot one is a b1tch to kill unless you're on a good team the real one havent had time to find but gives pretty cool loot. And then theres PvP server which are pretty fun if you got the right build and we're getting more quest and stuff may 7.
---
You got that hound incredibly close to the behemoth, wow. I wasn't even able to get it halfway there, and when I started sploding it, it dissappeared in thin air. So I think this challenge is impossible for me. My tinfoil hat is starting to think maybe the challenges are so obscure on purpose. Almost all the challenges have been extremely specific this week and usually requires multiple people playing together.
---
Another option will be go to whitesprings and use the animal friend perk or the other one tame a hound and take over to Solomon‚Äôs pond
---
As far as the story? Sure, technology would be a better starting point than gold. But also not everyone pops a boner at the thought of pre-War tech like the Brotherhood. I don't really understand why FEV has to be involved, but that's beside the point anyway. Ultimately, the US Bullion Depository is gonna play a part in whatever that story is. Bethesda might as well just say so, because, again, it's clearly visible on their plans for the future of the game.
---
Sweet! Thanks :-)
---
Why would you carry that many in survival...
---
you might need better friends lol.
---
The animals don't move with you, they just stand still and don't attack. Another player already tried this
---
This has been happening to me on PS4 for a while. Sometimes it's too bright and sometimes it's too dark, either way it gives everything a weird look.
---
I haven‚Äôt even started making the trek yet. I still have to get a bunch of supplies and ammo.
---
I'd agree with the Savage Divide at the bottom.  It really lacks a defining environmental hook, imo, and the red soil and conifers get tiresome to look at.
---
I like the Mire conceptually, but there is an awful lot of nothing there.  I really wish that Berkeley Springs was more of a town than a Workshop, or that there was another town on the northern end of the region.  That whole northeastern corner of the map needs something more than Workshops.
---
The Forest is my favorite region overall, but the one I have the least business in, being high-level.
---
What level do you think I should be before trying to kill the bastards?
---
Bye bro.
---
Are you already done?
---
 Well son I have been using it for nearly 30 years now and I'm not about to change a thing. I have idea when it became 'creepy', but modern times are like that.
---
I want to know what percentage of players use the camp to make completely dispensable C.A.M.P.s that they would be willing to lose?
---
can add me psn: Silune just mention this post in friends req (i ignore random invites)
---
Early on I had a camp near a local campground, but down the cliff, so it wasn‚Äôt too obvious. I put in some traps, up on the top of the cliff - stuck in a portapotty with a low-level lock, and inside I put a foot locker stash.
---
Every once in a while I‚Äôd see someone with 10 caps on their head near my camp and I‚Äôd go hunt them down...
---
I'd say 50 or above when you got your whole build settled in. From what I've seen the robot one is troubling.  Oh and there's also a sewer system now in Harper's ferry
---
 Wow. I have 8 diluted and 4 full ones. I sell Stim Packs once they start to pile up. ;)
---
The Chinese probably fired first, but that's not necessarily the first act of aggression. That would've been the construction of the Vaults. The MAD agreement clearly states that deterrents are considered an act of aggression.
---
I thought the server I was on was weird as well. Then at quarter to 11 I got a message that the server was going down for maintenance and I should find a new one.
---
Maybe they did model the vault, it's the best kept secret if they did though. I hope they're as ambitious as you are.
---
I use all my laser and plasma guns just fine. Gunsmith maxed and weapon artisan maxed and I can go a whole 2-3 days before repairing. 
---
Are you using a semi or automatic version.
---
Someone else trash could be your own trash. - OP's friend
---
Agreed. I never have a need to repair my energy weapons. Only when after fighting the queen will I need to repair them and that‚Äôs mainly due to me giving 5th degree burns.
---
I have a explosive troubleshooter laser pistol that eats up robots, but breaks after I kill a few no matter what... Even with cnd repair and all the Perks
---
Ah okay
---
My PSN: Abstr4xGaming
---
Will you be doing nuke runs regularly? I‚Äôm not high leveled but I‚Äôd more than love to join in.
---
I didn't take anything out, but yeah that first time I saw a stash in the wild it took me a minute when looking inside to realize it was my own stuff.
---
Yuck.  I think that's the only event I haven't done.  First time I ran into it someone else was doing it.  I was so annoyed I've never been back.
---
11, don't plan to use them :)
---
You on ps4? Id happily hold items while you switch characters, and my main character is level 320, I have everything I need already. I would never steal even so much as a stimpak
---
Very nice
---
I kinda do, out of instinct I pull out my pup boy for local lol
---
116 of them
---
I have push to talk on and still feel paranoid and mute my mic.
---
How in the world are accidentally exiting your power armour in the middle of battle
---
Get a Tesla rifle.  Problem solved.
---
I get this as well with the Vault-Tec floors and the Brick Walls.  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/oKejW7Y](https://imgur.com/a/oKejW7Y)
---
Shoot the vertibots first, the cargo ot will circle you forna period after. Then aim at the jets, disable one and if you don't bring it down, it'll slow down so you can kill it.
---
Don't need heavy guns, they're only lvl 20, without .uch dmg resist.
---
Just follow the main questline.
---
Agree with you amigo. I got a two shot laser rifle and a legendary Plasma Rifle (AA) and I can't remember the last time I had to repair them to be honest.
---
Im not sure how how much class freak affects the food and water drain but i have to drink pretty much even woth class freak
---
Hmm okay thanks, i'm not sure whether i should take it now or not
---
Namely when you have to spam e at some points; i.e. repairing pipes in the silos, herding cows during the sheepsquatch event, whatever
---
I get like 4 DR from my marine armor helmet and some from my tattered mole head
---
Stash was full, I tried to put them in there
---
I had a 100+ but dumped all around Flatwoods - imho a total waste of time and effort to go do the request and pick 'em up. Wouldn't be so bad if they had 'decent' stuff in them lol.
---
My entire weapons stash is lasers and plasmas and only one that breaks often is my two shot Ultracite laser. Which is expected as two Shot is double durability per shot as I have been told.
---
Explosive rounds decrease guns durability
---
I've been meaning to ask, should I just follow the questline and ignore exploration for the time being?  That seems like the fastest way to leve and unlock the core features.   Save exploration and side quests for after?
---
Hey, you do you, but in the last 30 years the definition of excessive hasn't changed. Using 'em after every post isn't deflecting anything as much as it's probably making people think you're *being* confrontational. But this is all totally unrelated to the subject so I'll stop here.
---
Spamming the button has never caused me too exit since it's a button hold
---
Stealth commando
---
Nine.  Don't bother picking them up anymore.
---
I still recommend getting speed demon since water is very easy to come by and the faster reload and movement speed are great bonuses
---
It's you
---
I mean...again, it's right there. On the roadmap. Not even a secret.
---
Hell, I looked at it again and there's even a little base of some kind. Barbed wire fence, a lookout post, the works. Almost like, y'know, a *fort*.
---
 Yup. Guns suck, knives rule. It took me some 150 odd levels to figure this out, as I'm very old and slow. :)
---
 Does that really make a difference?
---
I bet it's with all atom shop floors at this stage.  I haven't been able to test them all but only the normal floor doesn't seem to have a problem.  I hope it's fixed with patch 9.  It would be nice if //u/ladydevann or one of the other cm's would a let us know it's being looked at.  
---
It's a bit disappointing that we are having issues with items that we bought in the atom shop and no acknowledgement that they are aware of the issue.  I've checked for any acknowledgment and haven't found any.
---
"Heal the wooorrrrlld, Make it a better place....   "
---
Sounds like bs to me considering I see the difference intelligence makes in xp constantly.
---
Nope. It would be great if they were, but they last 24 hours I think
---
I think explosive weapons break faster anyway. I know my TSE Handmade breaks often. Could be part of why explosive energy weapons are legacy now.
---
Hmm I'd assume this is a reference to the Underworld in the mall?
---
I have a marine helmet that gives me none. but even still 4dr is nothing
---
She is also shown in the introduction trailer when You start the game while the one guy is giving the speech She is sitting there as-well and later on giving some lecture and while they show how the residents are leaving the vault , the lady with the glasses .
---
solid post.. good suggestion...
---
Which bos plan....
---
There is no current way to trade items, most players are capped on caps, and whoever puts up their item first could easily lose it by the other person taking it and logging off. There is no good way to trade stuff, and you being a condescending ass for what's obvious doesn't accomplish anything.
---
/u/Valseek /u/Ladydevann /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/CM_PipBoy /u/nerdwithme /u/BethesdaGameStudios could one of you suggest this idea to your team? I give you this picture: [https://imgur.com/BTSAiA4](https://imgur.com/BTSAiA4)
---
Kind of. The smiley still made it read like biting sarcasm if that's what you were going for!
---
Dunno dont you recognize your own stash? Especially back when it was capped at 400
---
Tatered mole head gives one dr
---
There are two different marine helmets, but the 4 DR are a joke, thats true.
---
But armor on Headwear would force players to wear specific helmets. Many players want to wear an outfit they like or to show off their faces. Having to wear a helmet would restrict this drastically.
---
The robot/imposter aka encryptid event is a group event. I've done it on my 15, just don't be surprised if you don't get enough hits to get any loot off the body, nobody revives you and you die a lot. Be happy with the event rewards and hope you only get one fedora. Make yourself valuable and turn on the pylons and avoid the Mr Gutsys. 
---
Free range is a group event too but despite my 50 being the lowest level there it's been easy to get enough shots in, just be up front of the herd. 
---
You can however encounter the real sheepsquatch outside of the event too. He has a variety of attacks and my go to of shotgun with enforcers doesn't seem to stop him, merely slow him down. Keep an obstacle between you and him and do what damage you can until he goes down.
---
Love The Mire. Spend most of my time there. It's just so damn creepy at night and so damn pretty during the day.
---
Second favorite is the Toxic Valley. Those night time views... 
---
The Ash heap is cool. Mole miners are badass. Love the shaking ground.
---
Forest and Savage Divide are my least favorites. I do love the views from the mountains, though.
---
I'm holding mine only cause we dont know how the vendor thing is gonna work. i wish they would give more insight so I can know to sell em to in game vendors or what ever.
---
Maybe if they actually fixed things like this I'd spend money on Atoms and not just do dailies for them
---
When's the vendor coming
---
Wut?
---
i sell them to regular vendors or leave them in high traffic areas in whatever containers seem likely to be checked...
---
Mire, Ash Heap, Toxic Valley, Savage Divide, Bog, Forest
---
Valley would likely be #1 if they fleshed it out some more.
---
I've gotten a lot of lag with the new update, but maybe thats just me. It's not only that accidentally entering your power armor during a fight, it's just in general that it takes so long.
---
The legendary vendor is coming soon, so currently I have a mule character (lvl 8 ish) that is holding all my spare stuff as well as a friends stuff too. 
---
I have no idea how the legendary vendor is going to work, but I know  I would kick myself it turns out that the rubbish items I sold for 5 caps were good for something
---
Yeah, that or you get a recipe that turns a large amount of them into a higher quality one too. I wouldn't even mind having to have to do a quest to get the upgrade recipe, may be fun! Great suggestion though mate!
---
Yes at least they would have a good use instead of just taking up space.
---
Will be back on later - feel free to send me a message if you still need it.
---
Now I guess there's a new bug - when I die, I suddenly become over encumbered, even though I was not before.  And, it only allows me to respawn at "98 NAR" and I have to PAY to respawn there?!?
---
Wow teach me lol
---
You're not unlucky. I also found it there many times but i don't remember hounds.
---
Legs and chest
---
 Oh. I won't use it again then. You obviously have not discovered knives and their clear superiority to any other weapon in the game. If you are interested I could go on. ;)
---
It's entirely up to you. I stopped the questline around level 55 and started it up again around 70. I dont really think there is a "best" way to do it.
---
I already had 3 behemoths at bog town but not a single hound. He just spawned always with Supermutants.
---
Damn, a day? It's been so long since I've used one as I've been trying to hoard them for the day when I can display them, but I remember them being like the bobbleheads where it was a couple of hours or more with Curator. 24 hours would actually give me enough of a boost to justify using one, except if they wear off when getting disconnected that's another reason not to...
---
As I was writing to answer this my server disconnected after a nuke touched down. Love when in game events can‚Äôt be handled by the server.
---
You wish. They last 30 minutes, 1 hour with the perk. 30 minute in a game like this is the time it takes me to prepare for the session lol.
---
Green is pool of workshop.
---
White is from your stash.
---
When you leave server, you lost everything you build. So yeah build there, but don't invest much of white material, bcos some dick can come and take that workshop from you.
---
"you can't do that in Power Armor" is looking pretty handy after this. That's messed up!
---
He gave you all his junk? That‚Äôs fucking tragic lmao
---
Xbox has a magnify option also
---
I love the Ash heap and the mire, their environments are just so different to everywhere else, cranberry bog is nice but to many scorchbeasts
---
I've yet to see a person in game with a tattoo.
---
I have arm... do you want change for chest
---
Sounds like it üòÇ
---
I can see what you mean with the time length too get in being annoying there some lag but I personally only experience tiny bits
---
When it come to Bethesda and immersion, lets never forget that they refused to add proper timers to buffs/debuffs to ESO because it would break immersion. It would almost be nice if the original designs for the controls didn't have one button do a large number of things so we'd never get to this point.
---
It‚Äôs not a day? Whatttt? Holy crap, that makes them near useless, excluding a few. Most of them suck and you aren‚Äôt really carrying them around. For example, the one that gives more resources from scrapping guns would be good, but like more damage to Grafton monster isn‚Äôt gonna help because you don‚Äôt know when you are going to run into one.
---
Heh my drunken brain autorrected your title to "assaultron on recall keycard."
---
What was your questio  tho?
---
What are the details of the armor piece?
---
I mean... Sure? I only ever tried to use the Bowie knife in 76 and was disappointed with the damage. I like that they're fast but I've never found one worth using on anything except trash mobs. Best I had was a two star with faster swing speed.
---
The gold is not coming from the fort knox vault, it's coming from a mountain. The fort looks heavily guarded but intentionally ambiguous. Maybe they don't want to be too obvious.
---
 Maybe the Wastelanders new quest is about helping wastelanders loot vault-tec vaults and pillage forts with the new faction. So far there's no direct connection.
---
I found them very hard to read and understand ü•∫
---
I think my first encounter with a behemoth at bog town was with hounds.
---
Okay, than I can better take the Contractor perk. I intend to use a lot of workshops in the future
---
Is the keycard supposed to removed from your inventory after use? Or have I encountered a bug?
---
yeah I always keep one of all cool clothing (o.10WT). Sadly, the event  is getting harder to do since people go, tag and back away. I've had time where I had to grab all 3 pylons for heavens sake
---
I think the last name might just be a coincidence since the note in question sounds like more connected to the founding of Underworld than to the story of the Keller Family.
---
Yes. It changes every armor to look the same.
---
I ain't gonna lie. What west tek did to that little town really had me fucked up.
---
Open safelocks on the cemetery to take my chance on plans.
---
Looking for armor plans at Harper's Ferry.
---
 Let me show you. This one hits about 4 times a sec and will do that till my mouse breaks:
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VkeHBbzn0fDIoPtTESY5CSHXsvO437Jz
---
Reminds me of my jukebox and West Virginia light fixture. I'm hoping eventually the game will remember the state you left them in as there was talk of your camp being persistent in some way. Probably way down the line and not a big thing they're working on yet, but it would be a nice, little quality of life change.
---
Als tattoo parlor had a bunch
---
Ahh ok cool, I‚Äôll just hold on
---
Energy explosive weapons are legacy because they fire bullet instead of beam. Did you ever saw TSE cryolaror or flamer in action?
---
And TSE breaks faster bcos you have two shots = two hits = broken faster.
---
I'm only asking because my leveling has dropped off sharply, despite chasing events and side quests. I'd really like to make 25 before this weekend is over.
---
You can milk brahmins now!
---
Anyone who says they didn‚Äôt is a liar
---
I‚Äôll just hold on then, thank you.
---
Disco isn't dead!  [https://imgur.com/a/9VQsotk](https://imgur.com/a/9VQsotk)
---
First pic was taken while server hopping at the Kelly Memorial.  It eventually cleared itself after a long Rainbow Road simulation.  It appears to be a test pattern texture that got applied to the ground.
---
I remember whenever id see a stash at a train station id take everything from it thinking its an overseer stash. Luckily i never lost anything but boy was i special
---
Nice addition. But it's had no difference to any other weapon with silencer. 
---
You can watch YouTube videos from silencer weapons,  every person can still hear the mechanic. But a bow or crossbow are really silent(right tuned). So you should get a bonus for that in game.
---
Cool thanks üôè, I‚Äôll give a few away.
---
Hey could we bump up the price to 1.7 k and IL add in 1094 5mm rounds
---
I wish you could make public access or have a public stash to give free stuff
---
"It's Mostly Garbage, but fuck him" pmsl üòÇ
---
This is what I was waiting for! Nuclear fallout farming sim :p
---
You hate the game yet you‚Äôre spending hours on here talking about the game. You must have some self-abuse fetish.
---
Here‚Äôs a tip, leave.
---
Yes, it is a usable quest item.
---
I think all 4 of the 4 horsemen paintjobs will do the same thing. Someone did a data mine of the last patch and managed to pull out images and they all look like X-01 armor sets. Not that I'm complaining üëç
---
No, it's still not how it should have been at launch but it's getting closer
---
Flatwoods Red Rocket.....
---
yeah in VATS there are situations where you can't hit a target even if you get 95% and shot 2-3 times.
---
Check suitcases, cash registers and containers in train stations and around Flatwoods. They don‚Äôt usually contain much but higher level players dump good stuff they don‚Äôt need in them from time to time.
---
So magic, burn the witch!
---
Bos arm plan
---
I'm sitting on 100+ of these holotapes and don't use them (for the known reasons), but also can't not pick the up. It's a dilemma...
---
Hahahaha bye
---
If you have your pip boy menu set to the normal screen where you actually pull it up you can cancel that, just open your pip boy before you actually take a sip of the irradiated water.
---
If you are new just claim workshop, do defend event right after and then go to another one, this way you will unlock most of CAMP plans soon. After you will be mostly taking one workshop where are 3junk holes, powerplants and munition factory.
---
Never needed perk for building, but i am crazy hoarder. 
---
If you repair powerplant near you also don't need to build generators, so you will not spend any of your own material.
---
Sorry, meant like the tesla rifle
---
Alot of games like Maplestory and other various "pay for premium content" games release a cheap cash helmet that turns defensive headgear invisible to show off your neat-o aesthetic.
---
Was it patched recently? I took this when I was around lvl 35-45, but now I'm level 70.
---
Also there is new boss that eat brahmins, so good luck with milking those bad girls.
---
Okay, thank you
---
The perk system just needs overhauled in the first place. You can already get the perks you want by simply leveling up so I think this would be a needless feature.
---
Eye of the Cyclops. No wonder they went in. ;)
---
All I can say is that if it required the operson getting killed to have owned or recently attacked a workshop, that glitch wasn't the cause.
---
Ohhh, no it doesn't do any extra damage against robots. The only benefit with the Tesla Rifle is that it is an energy weapon that can arc between enemies, so it's a good crowd control weapon if you have a high DPS for it.
---
I‚Äôve got about 100 and fully plan to spend a day loading these tapes into every tower in the game until the map is full of supply drops all set to steal for everyone but me. I‚Äôm hoping for chaos, will probably get mild confusion and a server crash.
---
I suspect it's like the real world cold war, someone got a false reading and someone else in charge over-reacted. We almost kicked off WWIII a few times because of that.
---
I mean of you run out of space I would trade them up. One to two ete. But ya once we get it or more info I would make a decision then.
---
I just respawn in Harpers Ferry, and if you need help on Xbox, I'll help
---
There's no way I would comply.  I would stay and kill everything and do whatever I could to make it unpleasant. I've had it happen at the golf club during a nuke. About four or five of them were having a little circle jerk in the parking lot.  Had a few of them mouthing off, telling me to stay away in a nuke zone I set off no less. Some people just have no respect or are overly entitled.
---
Thought about this too, but there is another problem: if you wear an invisible helmet you can either not equip any other headgear like glasses, or you can still equip face items, but not your favorite hat.
---
Oh I thought u meant u have the armor right arm I‚Äôm looking for.  Sorry not into exchanges until I complete my armor set.
---
I can't respawn anywhere else. The only marker that shows up is white powder resort. Also, on ps4
---
I mean, I've heard the term used so much, and never by someone remotely nautical.. pretty sure it's just commonly used at this point.
---
Yeah sorry  app didn‚Äôt refresh.
---
Are you Reed Richards? Because lord your reach is fantastic.
---
"The United States Bullion Depository, often known as Fort Knox, is a fortified vault building located adjacent to the United States Army post of Fort Knox, Kentucky."
---
Literally one of the first results from searching Fort Knox on Google.
---
Yes. Its why I bought it for my X0-1. Luckily I really like it.
---
Great shot, love the edit. 
---
I agree, I feel the photos should be in B/W by default... or at least grainy with soft colors.
---
And I love that Bethesda named the corpses ‚ÄúAnsel‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnne‚Äù. Anyone who is big into photography knows about Ansel Adams, and Annie Leibovitz!
---
Just found the camera myself (Miners Monument, first try). Here‚Äôs my first shot, also edited in B/W https://imgur.com/a/WZ05DWO
---
well the body is client side so the camera helps a lot it helped a lot of my friends
---
That would be a problem if they coded all headgear, but the only 2 examples I've seen have specifically targeted defensive headgear, leaving aesthetic altercations alone.
---
Ah of course! I just clocked that he was named after ansel adams (how do I have a fine art degree lmao) , so now I really wish they were in black and white
---
I won't be playing for like 4 or 5 hours but you can hit me up. HRockit 
---
But like the other guy send me a request saying who you are if you dont mind
---
Didn‚Äôt they say they removed them from dropping until they figured out a way to fix explosive with energy?
---
It's a Glowing Yao-Guai these days, at least... that's all it has been for me the 3 or 4 times I've been there, but I was also over level 100 for it all. No idea if that matters.
---
I suspect it's a Yao-Guai to be more in line with the one "Unsolved" side-quest that was released alongside the Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
If your stash starts getting full, sort by weight and sell off the heavier 1-stars. If you have the mats to spare, try to mod some heavier legendaries (preferably 3-stars) to make them a bit lighter
---
Ok anytime sorry I could respond in time for today‚Äôs run but I appreciate the response
---
That‚Äôs true, but we do not yet know the name of the father, and he could have visited West Virginia, but also finding the ghoul in the armory, but that‚Äôs just pure speculation. I do agree that it is almost certainly a knod to the underworld.
---
I have right combat arm 2‚òÜ unyielding
---
 English, please.
---
Hi
---
Easy fix would be to add another header slot for this, but they would have to edit all existing head items for this.
---
The vault of ft knox is inside an iconic styled building, it is not in the side a piece of land. That doesn't make sense for it to be ft knox unless they're being abiguous. Id say you're reaching for connections when there's only ambiguity.
---
It is a reference to it to my knowledge, but the writer of the note could or could not be related to the Keller Family
---
Nice to know I'm not the only one dealing with this....  
---
Have to admit, I loaded in the first time this happened and thought, "Oh sweet!  The seasons have changed to winter!"....   Yeah, no.
---
Server hop about 5 times at the shooting range, there like 10+ in the vicinity
---
30 minutes for a looking for group post &gt; 30 hrs of idiotic hopping.
---
I did get a jetpack once in the bunker from over 2000 total hops  but i have seen many posts this week of people selling them and was merely providing the most efficient way of obtaining them. Shit on it all you want, recommend the least efficient way all you want, brag about how lucky you were with hopping all u want but clearly OP has tried this and wanted a better way which to me, renders your suggestion useless.
---
Well that went poorly. Launched and almost no one showed up üòÇ. Next time I‚Äôll post here with plenty of lead time I guess. Thanks to the 2 dudes that showed up that was wild
---
I can agree, I had to spend around an hour server hopping to find the marine wetsuit and tactical helmet plans.
---
Sentinel isn‚Äôt the primary on that piece, assassin is. Certain items are named differently, anytime assassin and sentinel are on the same piece it will be called ‚ÄòSentinel‚Äôs blah blah‚Äô same thing for an assassin cavalier piece will be called ‚ÄòCavalier‚Äôs Left Arm‚Äô. Sentinel and cavalier only come on three star legendaries though because they are a third effect legendary affix.
---
I have the carnivore mutation so i usually just eat ionized meat because it doesn't spoil and drink inert flux because i am often in nuke zones. But i am afraid it's becoming too annoying, and i'm running out of resources
---
I just did the angry emote and left. It made me wish I had a group to call on, but I don't. They shot at me a few times and, as I have no idea if the slap damage has been removed yet, I just left.
---
Saw one at white spring resort really close to the enclave bunker entrance, fight was on when I fast traveled in and I helped the other players finish it off.
---
It's the only one I've ever seen though.
---
Does it have sneak?
---
I'd oneshot everything I could if someone did that.
---
I'm aware of that. To get extra sneak bonus damage that'll be using Covert Operative(works with all ranged weapons, silenced or not) and Mr Sandman (at night).
---
I think for it's sneak damage it's fine as it is, keeps it balanced with other sneak ranged damage, giving a consistent 3.5x damage if using Covert Operative and Mr Sandman (swap them around and you get 3.75x, but when jumping servers it resets to covert and then Mr sandman) but I do think that it's damage output needs to be upped if it want's to compete with hunting rifles and handmades, since the crossbow more feels like a gimmicky weapon, fun to use, but as a main? Nah. 
---
If I run a stealth bloodied build, I can one shot pretty much most enemies with a lvl 35 Bloodied crossbow, but that's with a pretty suicidal build just to make it viable, which I don't think should be the case.
---
Don't say that lol. I wanted a reason to stop server hopping. Eheh
---
I use this when im looking to see what exists:
---
[https://incendar.com/fallout76\_mods.php](https://incendar.com/fallout76_mods.php)
---
Cheers
---
That one was tough for me too, took me a couple tries to get past that particular point. Patience :) Maybe go do some other things to level up and get stronger and then go back to it.
---
Same yeah on PC, not just there either, each biome gives a different vomit
---
I'm pretty sure there is a time right before the server disconnects that the game doesnt record anything you are picking up. 
---
Been burned by that once or twice myself.
---
Dang, was thinking it (the tesla rifle) might have had better damage against robots because of the electricity
---
Kinda like the pulse grenade/mines.
---
Why were you carrying many stims in the first place?
---
I was wandering around. Saw a paper bag. It had multiple legendaries in it. I looted them all thinking the owner of the bag had just died and lost his loot. Quickly logged off in case the owner would come for revenge. Yeah..
---
You ok? Should we call you an ambulance?
---
What level are you
---
Ever notice she's always injecting herself with chems?  I thought it was a nice detail.

The first problem can be easily bypassed. Just build a switch and wire it this way: generator ‚Äî&gt; switch ‚Äî&gt; siren. The siren is always automatically turned to on, but the switch isn‚Äôt. Now when you want the siren on, just flip the switch.
---
LOL. Just pointing out that they do drop. 
---
 I'm not sure how people can sell an admittedly rare item for not much more than its price at the vendor. I do ignore the market though, its not a part of the game I play. Sometimes when I sell an especially nice Legendary to Wallace, I think about it though. ;)
---
Rose is definitely "do up until you die often", then switch to other things. Go up and then hit the NE of the map or just travel around Toxic Valley and Ash Heap, and Forest.
---
The thing you don‚Äôt have with the weightless set is the extra damage for sneaking. With the chameleon set you are sneaking and will get the extra damage but other then that I wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
Water has never been an issue at any level, if the industrial isnt enough then build more of them. At level 144 I only run 4 small water purifiers and end up selling the extra more often than running out. My low level character, level 11, only has one. I always find boiled or pure water everywhere i go, plus nuka cola. I agree it would be cool to have but absolutely redundant.
---
It is a formidable enemy that many of us have been waiting for a while tbh. I practically solo'd a pair of them a while back, and damn if it didn't perk my interest in the game a bit.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat currently (lvl 25) rose sent me to a deathclaw. I just took as many drugs as i could and went fully stocked with ammo and stims lol .....I survived.
---
You wearing Power Armor? Unless you have amazing regular armor (stacked with legendary effects) and perk cards, you'll need that buff power armor gives.
---
At lvl 25, you can grab raider(minimum lvl 15) possibly a t-45(minimum lvl 25 but i could be wrong) or build yourself an excavator set, this one has minimum 25lvl. You learn the plans off the quest down south west(ash heap).
---
Yep, they fixed insult bot!
---
They should prohibit power armor exiting while in active combat too.
---
Ella Ame's bunker has quite a few. Each train station has a few guranteed.
---
Alright, fair, it's an iconic building, but it's also a *vault*. Of course they're gonna find a way to slap a Vault-Tec door on it, and of course they're gonna advertise it with that door instead of a building people might recognise. In case you hadn't noticed, people don't tend to look like Vault Boy either.
---
Name literally any other military fort/gold depository near West Virginia. Any one. Literally just give me one. Because I'm searching and I'm not finding shit.
---
The connection is "fort near gold stash near Appalachia". Not exactly a reach.
---
Are the real sheepsquatch just random encounters?
---
Meh, must be client side, but i digress
---
Well then it prettymuch up to what you prefer.
---
Youre little slower and normal reloads but hydrated or fast and thirsty
---
Whoever said good,luck with the revolution...well May 9th shows that Bethesda do listen and concerns regarding camp damage are finally being resolved.
---
Thank you developer team at Bethesda 
---
Key to stopping the assholes..don't have turrets. 
---
Bravo!

1-2 starts and not good prefixes drop or sell

It has been removed. Just stick around and annoy them. They to kill everything before they get tags. They can't hurt you if you are careful not to hurt them
---
Not sure tbh. It seemed to "fit" with the event I was doing, but it could have a been random...
---
The frat row houses and tattoo parlor easily have 40.

I heard about that,  I'm looking forward to stealth archer again

---
To dawg. We heard you like skins. So we put a skin on your skin so you can show off your skin B]
---
Im surprised that got downvoted tbh, just gave an upvote. But yeah theyre super rare because information about them is super unknown, and anyone that does know stuff about them, like me, is pretty hesitant to say much. There was a post on a xbox trade where someone had like 30 of one of the behemoth ones and everyone was saying why would you dupe them, where its easy to get 100+ of you know how, its just (almost) noone knows how.
---
Unlucky timing. This game has a refresh feature built in where enemies will die if they've been spawned too long with no players around to kill them. Happens to everyone now and then.
---
Ahhh no sorry, not how they work XD But I can see why you'd think that.
---
First off it takes all of two seconds to kill each wave of adds.  The stingwings and bloatflys die to a single shot from a tesla and if the yao guai even spawn they take like three shots from a rifle. With more than a single person around the adds die faster than anything.
---
Second of all you're bitching about me whining about people not being able to get a tag in.  That's not what I'm fucking talking about you fucking dipshit.  When people kill the things so fucking quickly it starts causing the game to bug out, the legendary tag isn't being applied properly and no one gets shit from it except the default drops.
---
Learn to read.
---
My suppressed gauss has been missing headshots regularly now for a week or so. You are right, no hard evidence other than I never before needed a full mag of shots to hit something just once.
---
+1 endurance and bos
---
Server hopping to avoid a bunch of 12yr olds seemed quicker and less hassle. Hopefully the next time they try it, it won't be a gentle female they are dealing with. I just wondered if this happens a lot to others.
---
Can confirm. Have 22 sitting in my stash to one day be used.
---
With Chameleon Armor you can crouch, turn around and reload your weapon, but only if you have your weapon out which means in survival you are seen by everyone as red dot in the world. The armor makes a sound that everyone can hear as soon you are going invisible. 
---
The mutation only works if you are standing perfectly still and you will be visible while reloading and do other stuff.
---
You only need one Chameleon Armor to be effective, while you would need a full set of Weightless Armor for the mutation to work or you just wear absolutely nothing.  
---
Npcs dont care if you have Chameleon or not. Mutation and Armor effect are only visible perks. Npcs only react to your Stealth perk cards, your stealth armor, and your Agility Points
---
Same cooldown as any other normal event it seems, though it's apparently a triggered spawn so someone has to get close enough to the starting location for it to pop up.
---
As awful as they were, they still were very useful.
---
Tenderiser perk makes your opponent more subtle to damage. So the more you hit them, the less their defence is meaning they'll take more damage for x amount of times, depending on what rank your perk card is.
---
It's not like bloody mess, since bloody mess is a flat out damage increase, where as Tenderiser doesn't increase your damage, but it decreases the defence of the enemy, meaning they'll take more damage.
---
Really lol... I had never heard it used frequently until I moved out East, to a navy town... Before that my grandfather was the only person I'd ever hear use it.
---
agreed. why do we always have to work around this stuff?
---
Try using the new camera to find the body. If you‚Äôre close enough it‚Äôll register the name. Same for the imposter assaultron event.
---
They should just fast travel somewhere else
---
No you can't and simply no one will comply, they have as much right to be there as you. You could invite them to a party and get them to help you, pretty sure if you talk nicely to most people they will join and help you out. Else just switch servers. Some areas are always busy. That's what at whitespring when I am farming, I block everyone in the area, so they don't follow me and try get in on my action or if I die, steal my loot. If it is a big area, you could block them for the session so they don't see or follow you around.
---
I saw you're new to Reddit, I wanted to point out you just replied to your post, rather than whatever comment this was intended for.. so they gave no clue you replied to them.
---
I was gonna do my grind route, see if my groups on then do Encryptid and maybe SBQ if we can get the silo run done, tag along for silo run?
---
I have a heavy 2* Bolstering +1 charisma
---
How would farming bobbleheads or magazines be an exploit?
---
So I've started having this problem while it was fine before (been playing since the beta), I had just updated my gpu drivers so I guess it just doesn't like something about that.
---
 What no Glowing Steak? Throwing 10% away?

I'm still lacking the camera however üëç for the tip üòÅ

I'll message you if they get on, and if we decide to do it
---
I did that early on, in that one red rocket in the first town you go to. I was so excited for about 45 seconds.
---
I can confirm this
---
The question is do you need the picture ? If you do I can hop on to help, but already have mine
---
Yes I do
---
RNG drops now.
---
Can you not read?  The WHY is right in the big blocks of wordy things you didn't bother even glancing at.  This isn't just complaining about shit luck and not getting any drops.  The enemies are dying so quickly they're bugging out and not getting properly tagged as legendary enemies, people kill them so quickly that they aren't even finishing their glow, aren't getting an updated name, aren't regenerating and aren't getting properly assigned to the legendary loot pool.
---
I finished the last mission with lvl 35 because i only followed the main quest, afterwards i grinded through every sidequest just to lvl up. I would suggest you to stay in a area and explore everything, do every quest possible and afterwards find your way back to the main quests. Trust me its better for your game experience and the overall storytelling of this game.
---
yeah, like over said, do some side missions to level up. right now weapons cap out at level 50, some quests give a weapon for a reward, so being level 50 is not a big deal to even start the main story line. shoot, play as much as you can today as it's the last day of double xp. just go out and kill, kill, kill.
---
Normally. $1k a leg give or take
---
LOL downvotes by the same scrubs who cant find and still dont know how to activate pip-boy/power armor head light.
---
Just what I had on me.  Random,  was just expecting to guard a few bots for the Enclave. 
---
With how fast everything spoils now, just can't load up like the good old days.
---
I am guilty, I did it too. The only reason I stopped after the first few moments is cause I recognized the magazine collection it had.
---
What level are you?
---
And it's fucking mind boggling how this even got through the beta testing.
---
I forget if I saw it here or on the official boards but someone posted an ini tweak that helps that. Apparently the game by default saves your data like every 10 minutes.  If you crash in between saves it will load the last character save. The ini can be tweaked to set it to 5 minutes or whatever so your data is saved more often. Sorry but I don't know what setting to change in the ini though.
---
I wish developers of games would be more open about hidden mechanics like this
---
105
---
If you consider how those requisition tapes work in the game, what you suggest makes zero sense.
---
The explosions are likely from the cars that litter the farm, blow those up before he arrives and you reduce the chance of one going nuclear and blasting the corpse away.  And even IF he gets ragdolled to kingdom come just remember where he died and wait for the meat pile to spawn, no matter where a body gets thrown the meat/scrap piles always spawn exactly where they died.
---
Def able to help but it might be a few hours. I've been itching to do a solo again.
---
I have 100's, glad they don't have any weight. I was hoping it would be based on level, but nope. Just complete trash.
---
Now I know, i'll ignore them if it happens again.. Carry on doing my thing and occasionally go on mic to remind them to tidy their rooms in my best Mum voice. I'm sure they will love that.
---
By the way you can get some pretty good stuff if you call them in from Relay Tower EL-B1-02 southwest of the lucky hole mine.
---
The problem is they fire bullets and not lasers.
---
 My favorite event. Costs nothing and is usually real quick.
---
I was SO disappointed when I found out the fortune teller machines don't do anything, seeing how detailed they were.  They also seem to be strangely unscathed by time and wear, much like the Port-a-Diner.  I'm also disappointed that the Whack-A-Commie game doesn't work, or any other carnival, pinball, etc. game.
---
what an original idea, never heard of that before
---
Man, that would be great, but I'm on Xbox.  Thanks for the reply, though, much appreciated.
---
Yes they did, I was just wondering if we got an eta or something?
---
I think it‚Äôs more immersive to change your mind than to be forced to lay down like a sloth.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1kuxc/materials_master_list_junk_management/
---
Yep. Ive had this most of the afternoon after doing Westek a couple of times. In the end I could only fast travel or respawn at White Powder or vault 76. I couldnt even respawn at my camp.
---
There's at least three spawns around the map for the event and the level 50 is easy mode, the other two I know of always spawn 1-2 level 80 sheepsquatch.
---
I only started playing recently. It has always been an issue for me with a couple of drivers. I did not install previous drivers to test.

what an original comment never read that before

Happening on my PC as well, this is very common in toxic valley especially, looks so ugly.

---
Lol,  no - "invincible", not "invisible". Could not do any damage to her...
---
Well, at least you didn't die.
---
Why?
---
Ye I like this a lot more, temporary health would work better.
---
Yes..... I'd really like to know.
---
I know that charisma seems to max out at 15 with vendor prices.
---
2 weeks ago I swapped my Unyielding armor for a full set of Troubleshooters and as far as Luck, Agility, and Perception go I don't see any difference. Are they capped at 15?.....l'd sure love to know.
---
I am thankful indeed. God bless Nerd Rage for probably saving my ass.
---
they are considered some type of flooring/foundation so you can not stack them normally. But there is a cool bug to build with them though provided you know what you are doing ;)
---
I would have very politely told them to shove a shepards crook in it.
---
There aren't private servers, this is an MMO. They were the ones acting out of line.
---
And there are so many places on the map that would lend themselves to an Ansel Adams type photo!
---
I still have 15 STR and every carry &amp; weight reduction card I can fit.  I never got around to reallocating.
---
I'm honestly sad I haven't, that sounds hilarious.
---
yeah thank you i done that wrong for the last two weeks
---
It looks like all sources of AP refresh stack with no limit. There are two related actor values: ActionPointsRateMult starts at 100 and is added to by Action Boy, Nerd Rage, Well Hydrated and Well Tuned. ActionPointsRate starts at 0 and is added to by everything else. I don't know what order they're applied in or what the base regen rate calculation is.
---
Muffled has a zeroed effect in the ESM, like hardened receivers and perforating magazines. Two pieces should stack, assuming that they do anything at all.
---
Movement speed isn't capped in the ESM but apparently it is capped elsewhere. All the speed-bonus perks and abilities I've checked modify the same actor value.
---
Legendary sneak detection armor doesn't appear to stack with multiple pieces. It should stack with the Sneak perk though.
---
Because Bethesda makes the AK (handmade) the best rifle when all real Americans from West Virginia know the AR or variants (M4, M16, etc) are really the best rifles
---
I want it because with the Assault Gas mask it's one of the few outfits that actually fit the games theme. I had the Traveling Leather Coat, but with backpacks coming I swapped it out for the Leather Coat. All about the cosmetic appeal for me personally. Looks great ONLY WITH THE ASSAULT MASK. With anything else.. Its gross.
---
But the Assault Mask is part of the set legitimately though. So only makes sense.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of stimpacks. I understand what Op means but I think it takes a percentage of your max aids. So the more you have the more you lose lol.
---
Same here, its god awful ugly. Running on ultra 4k. I don't think the settings make a difference though. This is on \[PC\]
---
very nice i feel free to take that offer thank you
---
im gonna message you next time im online
---
They definitely do things past 15. Intelligence especially.  With full unyielding gear and shielded vault suit, egghead herd mentality etc. My intelligence goes to 38. I definitely notice a difference in xp per kill with 38 versus low 20s without unyielding.
---
They started shooting at me as soon as I entered the area. Pretty sure they didn't want to team up. I just left the server. I have as much right to be there as them. Got it.
---
How bout you make another thread on the legendary vendor or complain about nylon bags
---
After 15 cha doesnt it only effect selling price, and thats only to 25.
---
Int has a xp curve above that of 15.
---
Usually when you collect bobbleheads or magazines (or as far as I know) they do not reappear to the player for a certain amount of time. If you were to be able to transfer said items, you could create new characters, have them collect bobblehead, transfer the items, then delete them. But I'm not that knowledgeable on how the game works so I could be totally wrong
---
Well all I can say that a new cryptid has been added into the game which can be found in the wild or event called "Free Range", along with a entire new questline that can be started with the "Sheepsquatch ate my brother" and will end with a hard repeatable event called "Encryptid". with this quest there are also 6 side quests. Another poster next to that will start the "Wasted on Nukashine" quest, which then can be a daily repeatable quest to make all the different alcohols you want.
---
At random tourist locations a tourist corpse can be found which will give you a camera as a alternate version of the game's photomode, along with adding a new quest "Bucket List"
---
Watoga bots can no longer be legendary, found out via datamining, but no evidence for West Tek being nerfed, but yeah it's not as good as before, same goes with whitesprings nuke runs, but they're still good in a sense.
---
Survival mode is still well, TSE or BE fest and drop +200 chems even though that was said to have been significantly reduced.
---
CAMP turret damage buffed to a degree scale with the player.
---
Repair kits got added, the reddit got into a civil war(again (don't buy them)), you have to click more to repair since it works in favour with the repair kit system (workbench-&gt;modify-&gt;Inspect-&gt;Use repair kit or repair with junk).
---
76 just had a double XP weekend, ending today, but will most likely happen again at some point.
---
Bugs patched, old ones returned, new ones emerged, most ambitious crossover of the century with that show.
---
Aaaaaand yeah seems like that, Legendary Vendor, Player Vending, Arktos Pharma, Pioneer DLC all coming soon, I believe the last DLC drop until nuclear winter is June 7.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm not sure how new vendor will work
---
Probably downvoted because you stated a bunch of arbitrary numbers that are completely dependent on relevant perks, in other words those numbers will be different for everyone unless they have the exact same setup.
---
Also the drum magazine is a bad choice, the perforating magazine will add roughly 20% more damage over the drum magazine. The drum magazine adds no damage, just lets you waste a lot more ammo.
---
If only this game was made with PC players in mind...
---
Can you actually use more in 1 go? So you should use 10 minimum for a possible 1 star pipe which might come in handy for tokens later with the vendor..?
---
I can never seem to find him, but awesome shot!
---
Yes they do drop like everyone else said. I would recommend trading for one if you dont have one yet. Once you have a good main weapon then its easier to farm for more but without that initial boost you could be farming painfully for weeks.
---
You could send a team invite to anyone near where you want to respawn and then respawn on them (if they accept the team invite)
---
In my opinion automatic really shines when you‚Äôre doing a vats crit build, because you can spam crits out very fast, doing massive damage.
---
This actually sounds like a lot of fun
---
Holy shit call the press!!!
---
You can stack the wooden stairs under defensive structures. 
---
My base is all over the place. Granted, it‚Äôs not the simplest layout to navigate. But it‚Äôs pretty defensive against griefers. If they take out any of the lower levels, the entire higher part of the base disappears. But if you fix just the one broken foundational asset, it restores the entire base.

[ID Machina Twitter](https://twitter.com/idmachina/status/1122594698483437568?s=21)
---
I think I can solve this one, this is the picture on the Wikipedia page for ‚Äúear tag‚Äù
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_tag
---
because clearly we must bring the AK/AR war from IRL into the game /s
---
I'd also like to have stacking fire escape stairs.
---
This is exactly the kind of thing that bothers me.
---
On the one hand you acknowledge the issues with the game design but then seemingly ignore it. The one-shotter (cheating aside) is working within the rules of the game that've given to everyone. 
---
The sheepsquatch or any "boss" level sort of creatures, particularly one that's central to an event, shouldn't be one-shottable. We don't complain about people one-shotting molerats and being douchebags for not letting people get a hit in. Either sheepy is underpowered or some balancing has to be looked into elsewhere.
---
Abused how? You get a perk card every level, letting you trade one you no longer want isn't more beneficial than simply getting a level.. so who cares?
---
A robot DJ would be cool.  Have him / her comment on world events.
---
I love accidentally sitting down at tables/chairs which throws me out of chameleon sneaking, for the 35 minute animation of me swinging my molasses filled body onto the bench
---
Not that I know

It reminds me of \[the theme song from Bewitched\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdNhPUXf6Lc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdNhPUXf6Lc))
---
I wait an you can Server hop to me
---
Same!  Server hopping at the water park for a while and decided to check others.  Teapot ftw!
---
A sheep eating a cow. I know they aren't the same species but still seems like cannibalism if not backwards as well.
---
Lmao he was being sarcastic... "Ready when you are, commander".
---
Yeah the thing is just i've heard that class freak doesn't really work with speed demon because of bugs or whatever, i mean it wouldn't surprise me.
---
So do you think 25 is the cap?
---
I know with Agility, Perception, and Luck I don't notice any difference at all. I feel like Unyielding armor isn't really beneficial other than for carry weight as a sniper.
---
One of my friends tried to buy his own armor from me
---
Is it BOS and how much
---
I don't understand what your point is.
---
Yes it‚Äôs BOS. 2k?
---
I actually did that same thing when I was low level. Currently I‚Äôm a level 105. I think I‚Äôm going to start a new adventure with a different character this time.
---
No, Rose already makes me want to dive into the game files to delete her audio enough.
---
Pm me your gt
---
We really need a 7.62 introduced...having .308 used for both the hunting rifle and LMG is just moronic in its current state. Crafting balance makes no sense. It's also painful to see an AK chambered in 5.56 next to the assault rifle that also uses 5.56. The handmade is just superior, there's absolutely no reason to ever use the assault rifle unless you really like using a world war MG in single fire taps. Sure, having the handmade use 7.62 sucked in fallout 4, but it wasn't because of the ammo type difference; it was just because 7.62 was a pain to get and you needed to buy it from a few specific locations. With abundant crafting and ammo boxes giving "DLC" ammo, there is no reason not to have 7.62 here
---
ah that's why I've been getting jumped all over the place by enemies.  They litterally spawn like 50 ft in front of you.  I didn't realize how bad it was until last night at WEST TEK. I'm running native at  3840√ó2160 (high/ultra) and also never had issues until the patch issue.
---
Ok my gt is urqh can u invite me
---
I never realized Intelligence affected XP...... I'm at 3.... LOL.
---
Are you sure about this? Pretty certain I've seen armor that only had assassin's and cav or sentinels, with no 3rd stat.
---
I feel like we've all been there haha
---
Yea np. I‚Äôm at WS Train NastyLikeMyEx
---
The found-item condition tables go up to luck 20, and the buy price table goes up to charisma 25. As Hard Bargain adds 3 per perk point, the effective maximum charisma should be 14. Scrap bonus intelligence goes up to 25.
---
I wouldn't know if the game actually uses any of these tables.
---
Its level 50
---
I am positive.
---
This got me laughing pretty hard
---
We need more Rose, put her anywhere i don't care.
---
I havent checked recently but still see a buff when i take berry mentats and finish my bic quest. And i have 18 base without the Mentats. 
---
I thibk perception makes enemies show up more easily on the radar.
---
  You are running Automatic which is Commando and quite different to Rifleman in perks and effects. So yes comparisons are hard.
---
 Did you stop to think what things like Adrenaline do when they proc. The Automatic drops full level Muties really well and as they don't take long, that stacks quite well. 
---
 As my knives are my focus ammo is not a problem and I can make a crap ton of 5.56 as I have pretty well all junk in my stash. Last time I made ammo there was some 280 steel and 160 lead, or something like that and I used very little of it.
---
 I am coming from a full Rifle build and warping that as the Automatic is so good. My poor Instigating Hardened Lever Action has been nerfed to 116 over my Commado perk. I will do that a bit more. ;)
---
Your world is full
---
How do Escape Artist and Sneak perks play with chameleon mutation and weightless armor? The Escape Artist perk indicates "running (not sprint) doesn't affect stealth". Does this mean if you have 2-3 sneak, plus weightless armor and chameleon mutation, you could become "visible" when running but still undetected in PvE?
---
If so, would be a good combo.
---
He had other stuff in there too but it was all low level crap.  At least the junk was useful.
---
Invite me
---
Like two shot a full sentinel assassin build strong.
---
Are you on PC? I think it depends on your screen resolution.
---
Well there's probably no need to expand on it anyway. Probably just added as an allusion to HP Lovecraft's writing like all the other references to random things in their games.  Would be pretty cool if the did though.
---
Alright you go run the queen naked with a fire axe and then tell me how hard the game is.
---
Did the event 3 times, never found the body :&lt;

Go live stream for us. Show us true domination. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll all be impressed

This is an awsome pic! Love it

 it depends. Do you know what to do with it? It can be very good but has to be repaired to 200% to sing. ;)
---
Main quest is probably the best way to take advantage of the double xp this weekend.
---
Lol, i will next time. Thanks. I just wanted to check to see if this was a thing I was unaware of. Survey says "nope".
---
38?!? No way. I mean how?!
---
Both screenshots are from PC. 
---
I played in 1440p a while, which broke with the last patch for an unknown reason. Now I am back to FullHD. But the terminals where tiny from the start.
---
Same here man. I had like five suits of power armor and a sore back, I know my stuffs mine.
---
Wonderful! That spreadsheet is exactly what I was looking for! Many thanks! Just wondering if you still keep it updated. Thanks again!
---
Agreed. In need for a serious buff. Until then they're just not worth using.
---
Earlier today I got rid of my Fat Man, missile launcher, auto grenade launcher and all of the ammo for those.
---
West virginia is infamous for its high government secret locations. 
---
It could be Secretary of interior bunker.
---
It could be expanding on Sugar grove or satillites. (the building looks similar to the roadmap) We could learn more about the Somnus Initiative. 
---
Mt. Weather is a secret location for government continuity, and makes sense if they're continuing the story of the Enclave. 
---
The vault could just be a vault-tec event.
---
It could be anything.

Really.....I wouldn't be surprised if there was a glitch that never gets reported because nobody knows.
---
i just found it an hour ago as random loot in medicine cabinet, but i think you can buy it in enclave bunker too
---
I mean... They're mutated cows, they're not meant to know where you're taking them. In fact I'm surprised they're not insane already given the world they live in
---
Hey I‚Äôll take those five atoms.  Is this an in-game event or do I have to fly to Austin?
---
Well, I'm just planning to sell it, as said with the price check
---
Absolutely think everyone gets this. Additionally this weird "smearing" on distant shadows.
---
Stream your domination of a imposter sheepsquatch, assaultron, Mr. Gutsy, super mutants,  snallygasters, yaos, or other non starter mob naked with a fire axe. 
---
We will all appreciate watching your nude dominance.
---
Put up or shut up.
---
I don't know why it's so big but you're getting Wild Appalachia as well. We're only halfway through but you get frat houses, a speak easy, conspiracies, a controversial sewer system (not really controversial, pretty universally disappointing) alcoholism, two bosses mentioned by the others and tourism. 
---
And like I said, only halfway through, maybe more like two thirds.
---
Especially given people are  selling drops for real currency....no such thing as etiquette.
---
There are people farming this game, not to enjoy the game but for income.
---
I'm curious, is this a controller thing? On PC, I don't think I've ever accidentally gotten stuck on an animation because I pressed the interact key on an object like water, or a chair.
---
Intelligence doesn‚Äôt affect XP. It affects components gained from scrapping, durability of crafted items, and hacking skills. The only things that affect XP are certain foods and drink, being well rested, inspirational perk card, mothman event, and leader bobble.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Quite possible.
---
Once the interaction is started you have to wait for it to complete to be able to back out again.
---
This exact same thing happened to me earlier today.  Not nearly as funny when all the ghouls are lvl 40-60.  I just let myself die and respawn rather than waste a bunch of ammo.
---
This is the single best reason why power armor is good.  You can't sit, craft or sleep while wearing it.
---
Eh, you're definitely not wrong. I've mistaken midnight in game for just a overcast day multiple times.
---
256 exactly I'll bet.
---
Escape Artist seems to be a probability card. Sometimes it works and sometimes not. It just means you can run through the sight range of enemies and still remain undetected and you also lose the \[Danger\] state much much faster, because enemies cant follow you anymore. Sneak perk cards and armor traits are exactly what you would expect from it. They just raise your overall sneak %
---
The mutation is pretty much useless, because you are forced to wear weightless armor. With only one Chameleon piece you can achieve the exact same effect and you can wear other better pieces together with it.  
---
I guess this is just like every other amor set or mutation another way you could -possibly- build, but its definitely not the best.
---
It got through three previous iterations of the franchise, as well.  Apparently it's a "feature", not a bug.
---
I‚Äôm guessing you only played Survival difficulty in Fallout 4?
---
I'm pretty sure you can find most chem plans in the enclave bunker (even the unheard ones like skeeto spit) but you can try your luck by grinding medicine cabinets. How how I found my recipe for bufftats.
---
Like at this point you're not even arguing for DC, I just feel like you want me to be wrong.
---
Those things can all happen *and* Wastelanders could still bring us to Fort Knox. But go off I guess.
---
I'm level 268 and have never seen one of these legendary effects. What am I doing wrong?
---
Lol look man idk what all that is about, you completely took a different direction than the post I replied to. 
---
I‚Äôm not worried about ammo or damage. My BE handmade does 300 dmg a shot and has 76% armor penetration, I can also spam a crit every second with my vats crit build. I can amass 10-15k 5.56 in a hour with the help of lucky hole mine and the scrapper perk.
---
I am level 102 btw
---
I'm not bitching. I'm telling you that you suck and should find another location if you want to grind shitty one stars.
---
Also, two seconds of each wave? Plural? I can solo the Sheepsquatch so fast the first wave doesn't even reach the cows and everyone gets good rewards. Expecting players to wait puts the cows in more danger. And for what? A 1 star legendary?
---
&gt;then people kill the things so fucking quickly it starts causing the game to bug out, the legendary tag isn't being applied properly and no one gets shit from it except the default drops.
---
You said you did 3 in a row.
---
I've done over 60. Sometimes a legendary drops. Sometimes it doesn't. It's always been this way with any legendary enemy. Not just the Sheepsquatch. Also, it's 1 star. So even if it did matter, I still wouldn't give a shit.
---
Go play Fallout 4.
---
Have you been having some stuttering issues. I dont think Ive had them this bad since before actual Sheepsquatch
---
You should try crying about it.
---
Watoga civic center up the stairs where the legendary sometimes is
---
What mods are you using on it? Because mine doesn't hold a candle to my base .44 western I crafted.
---
From the ESM, Class Freak probably doesn't work on Speed Demon for the same technical reason that it doesn't work on the more obvious negatives like Grounded.
---
Speed Demon's only 1.4x the food &amp; water drain though. I don't have much trouble keeping up.
---
Wow this is pretty sad the bs we have to deal with for some of these challenges
---
You're invulnerable during the animation...
---
Can someone please tell me why this post is getting downvoted? What the fuck is wrong with someone asking for things to do? \*DOWNVOTE\* &lt;---- This reddit is full of morons downvoting posts that actually help others , they basically shit on anything strategy/bug/ game mechanic related and spend their days whining about repair kits whilst begging for asthetically pleasing atom shop garbage. OMG LETS TALK PHOTOGRAPHY, IM so leet, I take in game pictures in video games cuz i fail at life.  
---
 Honestly though guys a little help here? I see useful posts(bugs/game mechanics/lack of endgame content) that need bethesdas attention  dying from downvotes and posts about pie's soaring into oblivion. Is it just me thats fucked in the head here or do we need to campaign an education program aimed at rehabilitating toxic downvoters? I'm seeing this post at 50% upvoted which means 50% downvoted. The guys asking for shit to do. If you don't care for the topic: Keep scrolling , don't fucking downvote something because it doesn't help you. Only downvote if you find it's going to affect your gameplay in a negative way, example:someone requests a feature for 10 star legendary items and you think it would ruin the game: HERE is where you downvote. If someone asks an innocent question and you don't care for it. Scroll on but for fuck sakes stop runining the internet.
---
I never knew what an ear tag was until just now.  I grew up in the city.  I'm guessing there's not an awful lot of development time allotted to go find a shepherd and take a photo of one of their sheep for some tiny detail in the game.
---
And twice now I've had it go into the pond and it took me and other players a good 10 min to find it others had left,then today I got my first crash to desk top during the event.
---
356 was all the stims I had, that's why I am upset.
---
one man's trash is same man's treasure
---
So another way to put it is if he has a good AA weapon, move the perk point from rifleman/commando instead if tank killer?
---
Yup I've had this bug twice now and can't spawn anywhere on the map at all so I have to restart my pc.
---
I have close to 200 of these things now. If they had at least a chance to roll a plan I would have used them by now.
---
The way I see it is that a couple runs through Whitesprings will net me generally around 3-5 generally one star items so no real need to hang on to those.  I save anything 3 stars though.
---
You asked specifically for Areas around west virginia on your last question. I initially responded with other areas that it could be with enthusiasm, since it's fun to speculate. I have even given you outs and conceded with statements that i think it would be fun to be ft. knox. But since you keep pressing it, im contributing with alternatives of conjecture. There's no right or wrong here.
---
Yeah  I have multiple times
---
I feel this. I try to hit nuke zones as often as I can, along with the queen. But both situations usually have me chewing through ammo for a long list of weapons like candy. I usually end up busting out a gatling plasma, the action hero, a vampire lever action, crafted handmade, and others until they're out of ammo or broken. Its...a but of a nightmare. I'm hoping one or two solidly strong weapons will eliminate the need for that big of an arsenal for bigger fights.
---
did they fight?
---
Wounder what he was thinking about at the time,maybe supernumerary port :)
---
Destiny has no effective storyline and thus is boring.
---
An anti-armor rifle works pretty well.
---
I tried replying...it went to the normal post reply thread...
---
I hate it... Can't be dull moon rvey fucking night.
---
Neon billboards look like shit because it's always fucking light
---
Very useful, thanks!
---
Absolutely yes.  Severe stuttering (or 'hitching' as they call it in patch notes) on loading since the most recent patch.  It doesn't matter if I'm at my camp or not.
---
I just hope the toaster, handcuffs and nukashine will all be used together.....
---
Huh...you act like sucking dick is a bad thing.
---
Bring back Chinese assault rifles and service rifles
---
One site says 2 hours
---
Ive tried doing this several times now but the hound keeps leaving or dieing

#WHAAAAAH
---
Turned Appalachia into a [discotheque](http://imgur.com/gallery/PO63RnI) on a regular ps4. This happened at night both times and only after the free range event got added
---
Well done, that one was too much hassle for me üòÖ
---
price check r/Market76
---
If you interested, You can hold 254 holotapes maximum then it says maximum weight capacity is reached
---
Thanks! It'll give me something to do while i wait for GoT.
---
Yes and no, as I understand it. They're figuring out an energy equivilant to explosive so I doubt they'll do anything to effect legacy stuff unless whatever they come up with uses the same perks as explosive.
---
You have to press your reload button/key repeatedly to charge the weapon then hit your fire button/key, the more charged it is the more damage it‚Äôs meant to do
---
The behemoth didn‚Äôt even wake up until I hit him
---
Scaly Skin, Marsupial, Speed Demon, Egghead. Maxed out Class Freak.
---
Stealth commando, non-PA.
---
At lower levels used a few points of ironclad and junk shield. Scaly Skin helped me move those perk points from defensive to offensive.
---
Yeah why do we have like 7 min for the imposter &amp; 30 minutes for the real squatch? What seems to be my problem with encryptid is most of the people attacking the imposter use guns &amp; not melee (weird because I feel like melee is so much more popular these days) so I‚Äôm attacking the imposter &amp; he‚Äôs only hitting me, plus the couple hundred colonel gutsy‚Äôs that shoot you from every angle. I think that needs to be addressed.. I don‚Äôt even have that many enemies during my SBQ fights lmao
---
I just wish I could erase them and leave them in a pile in Sugar Grove.  Don't want them to run out!
---
It weighs 0. That means you have to pick it up. Fallout rules
---
Currently pooping.  On way after.
---
You can do whatever you want want with your own flux, but coming in here acting like all "late-gamers" (a term which using it to describe oneself cracked me up enough) use stable flux for fusion cores is ignorant and self-important. I, too, was ignorant of anyone bothering to make their own cores, hence my initial confusion and subsequent remark (in which I did not comment one way or the other on your habit). Then you got all late-gamers, with what I'd say as a niche habit of using what is on the open market 250-400 caps worth of resources to make one fusion core, and seeing as you can buy them for 50 or less or farm one at a workshop in less than five minutes, I called it a ridiculous thing to do. It is, but do I care if you do it. Not one whit. My concern was you convincing someone else it was a good idea. Economically, it's not.
---
Wow, really? that sucks. Either way, I wouldn't do that to someone else. I like to make someones day. not ruin it.
---
I stayed close, took a flat road and even protected him against other mobs
---
Yeah I was doing that one too, lucky for me the mole miners are only level 40, though I am level 32, so it is still a challenge.
---
It's interesting that you can cancel some melee animations in favor of a block, but you can't cancel Sit/Use/Craft animations at all.
---
No, I asked for *forts and gold stashes* near West Virginia. Like I don't know *Fort Knox*.
---
Why do you want me to be wrong so badly? We can still get those other areas *and Fort Knox*.
---
But the roadmap clearly shows that a major update will involve a fortified base of some kind and a vault full of gold that will more than likely be near the existing map but also expand upon it.
---
*Like Fort Fucking Knox*.
---
You get it. He doesn't.
---
254. looks like last 2 are reserved for something
---
Thx for this
---
Like yeah, sure, it's all conjecture at this point. But one of us is basing our claim on existing promotional material posted by Bethesda themselves.
---
Other than the burrows no not really
---
A zoom feature would be handy on PC, especially with the notes with the "handwritten" fonts.  I don't know if I'd want holotapes to have a time limit.  Some stories take some time to tell.  The one in Blackwater Mine comes to mind, as does that really heartbreaking one in Glassed Caverns.  I would never want the "cut for time" versions.
---
Burrows is good. Plus not usually crowded
---
 Burrows can have some great mob density.
---
Lol. Gee found all those plans in a suitcase at Watoga... That would explain why... Glad I didn't buy them earlier...
---
I am phasing that from level 3 to level 1 and may phase it completely out. Plan to move those points to suppressor and serendipity.
---
Makes sense to me now that I built up some points in adrenaline.
---
Sorry what does ESM mean? And why doesn't it work on grounded?
---
I keep 10, and dump any extra that I find in blue suitcases at train stations.  They're probably a lot more helpful to new players.  I'm all set on dog food, water, a tomahawk and pre-war money.
---
Well you do, as someone else said, just one shot everything instead of leaving to annoy them .. .once everything is dead they will leave. What area was it by the way ? It really depends where you are to waste time annoying them. I report and block douche bags for unsupported behaviour if they doing that .. doesn't do much but makes me feel better.
---
Well I guess I'm not, then.
---
On my way!
---
You are a legend.  I just gave up on that challenge.
---
Hahaha
---
If you're running an AA ranged weapon with an AP magazine then your paper damage won't normally be high enough to worry about breaking 6.5x DR against strong enemies. A possible exception is the gauss rifle, but against the SBQ you still won't get close to the cap.
---
Sometimes the high level player doesn't have to be there, they just had to have been there recently. 
---
It's getting pretty bad how melee outclasses everything. I can do more damage with 80 points of damage on a death tambo then 80 points of damage on an AP sniper. You should always at least be ready to switch to melee quickly. I can take down level 68's relatively easy when my character was about a mid level 30 with melee.
---
I'll have to test it more. I just did a Whitesprings run. Crouching or walking the mutation works. You don't need a full set of weightless for it to work. Obviously, the more you have of the weightless, the more protected you are. 
---
I didn't pay attention to when I was reloading, but it didn't appear to take me out of Chameleon invisibility. 
---
Unfortunately, Whitesprings had eyebots, and they spot pretty much everything. I did seem to be spotted quicker with the mutation than I normally would be with full Chameleon armour.
---
I'll keep testing and report back.
---
Wait what?
---
How much of your AP is Tank Killer? Do you know?
---
 That seems very low for a Bloodied build, My Instigating Lever Action seems as useful, hitting in the 500 range with 2x Stealth. 
---
 I don't, and won't use VATS so I have nothing there. Lets juts agree we can both make a lot of ammo. My Automatic Handmade is fun. Just like my Auto Grenade Launcher is fun but let me show you a picture of what I do. This is cold before it starts to accumulate kills and its not maxxed. It will do that about 4 times a sec till my mouse breaks:

Aw heck
---
Fake.
---
He already fell to his death in How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden world.
---
Is duping still a thing?
---
As long as Superman is OK...
---
And Ned Stark dies in The Walking Dead.
---
Sorry guys, you know I had to.
---
A little late but yeah I'm always in pacifist, never even turn it off.
---
Done yet?
---
Yup, must be a double XP bonus thing. Shit dying so you waste time and get no XP at all.
---
Yeah good point
---
LOL.  This is sooooo true, especially the low-level bosses.  FYI, don't automatically pass on a lvl 20 boss.  Sometimes they drop crazy shit like [this combat rifle](https://imgur.com/7cXTTsp).  Should make for a nice steamroller once legendary prestige leveling is a thing.
---
Haven't started
---
Run through and just tap everything and have that group do your work for you or if you can quickly go through and 1 shot eveything,thats what I do lol. I have been farming westek long before it was popular and I will kill everything before some groups can clear a room.
---
Nope, he killed me first, and then killed my friend who was also selling to another vendor. Neither of us tried to engage, just get our stuff and leave
---
Guess ill give it another go
---
Do the servers still randomly crash? Are there unique item id‚Äôs on all weapons and armor? Yes and no. And as long as they two things don‚Äôt change, duping will always be a thing.
---
Yes there is a new method.
---
Almost like show patches in places also lol
---
It's a building with a fence and a seperate vault-tec door with treasure, missing any visual of ft knox. That could even be a persons camp in the image. Ft knox would be fun. There's no direct proof of anything that you're claiming.
---
Well i don't know how duping works
---
All that for a drop of atoms
---
That's a giant can of worms you've got there in your hand......
---
I heard the exact same music on my local radio station under a commercial, so I'm guessing this is what's affectionately known as needle drop. It comes from companies that create music of various styles for television and radio commercials and shows.
---
See:  [https://www.killertracks.com/](https://www.killertracks.com/)
---
If it‚Äôs in the game it‚Äôs fair, and you don‚Äôt get anywhere with trash weapons and to answer your question I don‚Äôt want to one shot everything I want to PvP and one shotting everything side effect of that. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm strong, everything else is weak.
---
No worries! I've seen people do it for months and no one ever told them, just figured I would share! And don't let people on here push your buttons, people can be mean when they're behind their keyboard!
---
They need to cut the drop rate of them by 50% and make them drop repair kits.
---
A "What Makes You SPECIAL" book should be Atom purchasable, but you get a free one every half year or so. Breaks all your cards apart and let's you reassign SPECIAL.
---
That would be something I'd be OK with in the shop.  Repair kits make all junk or condition adjustments suspicious, but a convenient total respect shouldn't have the same effect.  Unless they change the level by level point move.
---
Yes rule of thumb let‚Äôs say 3 stars would be better then one starts just purge all one or two stars and start from there
---
Where did you find the hound? West-Tec? I know where to find the behemoth
---
That's why I gave up.  10 atoms vs enjoying all of my 4 hours of gameplay today = gameplay.
---
Also a bug where if you move your house, or your camp gets packed up, you can't place it back down and have to reassemble from scratch lol. I did this to a 3rd floor, was pretty neat. But it was way back when the camp budget was trash.
---
I saw Ebner all in one piece there. He was looking kind of sad. I think he was disappointed they made him take a break.
---
I‚Äôve had a cow die twice, but why would the cows dying change the sheepsquatch‚Äôs drops?
---
Hahaha.
---
Do you even read reddit
---
That's weird... I was there yesterday for the quest and she wasnt wearing a mask if I remember correctly.
---
That‚Äôs not low for a handmade, and you‚Äôre comparing a rifle to a auto rifle. Your instigating lever seems low compared to my bloodied lever or bloodied gauss.
---
Didn‚Äôt watch the video, trust me when I say it would be a waste of my time. I have 1400 hours in this game, end game everything gear wise, solo‚Äôd the queen.
---
I dunno, who?
---
Gold lol
---
Top tip they are an excellent supply of pre war money (cloth) and smaller munitions like 10mm 45. 44.  and fusion cells
---
Fallout76.esm is a giant data file which gives a lot of clues about how the game works. You can read it with FO76edit.
---
Class Freak calls the function "Mod Spell Magnitude", but not all mutations are implemented with a spell magnitude. Several add perks instead, so they're not affected by Class Freak. It's one of those bugs that modders would have fixed in half an hour if it was a single player game.
---
I‚Äôm not going to say most of them aren‚Äôt duped, but that wasn‚Äôt the point of the post. My problem is all the ‚ÄúTSE people‚Äù are personified as demons essentially.
---
You don't get as much flux that way. Why don't you just nuke her how you want?
---
Clear cut case of this guy probably sucks at the fallout games and he's had enough.
---
 Its not a video, its a picture of my Combat Knife and its stats. Have a look.
---
I thought the same thing until I saw the same weapos I had.
---
that's the purpose of stock photos lol
---
Issues for me too, but on xbox
---
Game is soft locking my consoles (mine &amp; partners)
---
Have to hard reset my units
---
Oh god like why the **** aren't they fixing this? Can it be so hard?
---
For junk? Wow...  the time, coordination, and effort to pull that stunt off was a collosal waste.  Like accidental 1940s slapstick comedy.
---
Pretty sure everyone has done that. Lol
---
Fighting sheepy can be fun, just wish the rewards would be better. Ive fought him half a dozen times from random spawns, even more so during the events rarely get anything good.  May have something to do with me always soloing him. I run a non bloodied melee with mole miners gauntlet. For the challenge but thats normally killed cause people with TSE weapons always show up.
---
They might be using internet explorer.
---
Yeah its the same for my friends and me, got some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/bkNlt1r), fuckin sucks when your trying to get immersed then all of a sudden the ground starts to glow lol
---
Really you can just go in the nuke zone and get flux after event if your collecting flux while other people are fighting her your useless anyway
---
I like to server hop at grafton steel, tons of mutants plus the ammo, gunpowder and laser rifles they drop, you can scrap them for junk or sell them to get your daily caps
---
It was Harpers Ferry. I was alone, in the road The Burrows is on when they turned up and started shooting at me with angry emotes. At least I know what to do if it ever happens again. Unlikely, I hope.
---
Whoa dude...  raiders is definitely your clan.  Joe Peschi is your spirit animal.
---
I have a bloodied Bowie knife with swing speed that gets up to 700 dmg, I‚Äôll pass.
---
There is not a single good legendary weapon, I mainly meant the sheepsquatch which is level 80, I can understand the megasloth from fasnacht but a 1 star level 80 sheepsquatch will not drop anything good. In fact I try and kill it asap to get the people to defend the cows instead of trying to get a garbage legendary they can sell for 100 caps to another player.
---
The combat rifle takes .45 not .44. Don't know if you made a typo or that's your problem.
---
Are you crafting these? I'd gladly give you the caps for a lvl 50 Fixer.
---
Mine hasn't been that long, probably closer to 10 seconds. It struggles more just loading in enemies and other players characters. The worst is trying to join an event. Itll be 10-20 seconds before I can see anything other than their name tags
---
Don't blame me for your own stupidity. *shrug*
---
Yeah, sure, my "proof" is conjecture based on a stylized advertisement and real-world geography, but everything you've claimed so far has absolutely no evidence of any kind.
---
I'm just saying, you said they wouldn't do it because it would mean new models. I don't know how it devolved into this stupidity but I'm done being part of it.
---
Apologies to OP for this nonsense.
---
There will always be someone who is going to want something done their way just because they can. Despite knowing it's more efficient for the whole.
---
I have no hard evidence to display for you, but I am certainly harder to detect with 20+ AG......when stealth isn't bugged out to permadanger, that is.  When a couple unyielding pieces kick in to put it in the almost 30 range, enemies will push me aside as if asking "HAVE U SEEN THIS MAN???"  Of course, this is when the hidden mole rat oracle of the wastes isn't alerting the entire map to my exact location.
---
There's definitely a difference between 15 CHA and 20 CHA when selling.  Eat a Sweet Roll, Grape Mentats and a beer and check it out yourself.  A serum recipe becomes a lot cheaper.
---
Considering that you're seeing a benefit with STR, it stands to reason that all other stats have a benefit.  They're just more subtle than looking at your melee weapon's damage as a hard and fast number.
---
Intelligence do afdect the amount of xp you get as well as how much scrap you get from scrapping weapons
---
Actually as soon as something, say like the sheepsquatch in the new event comes out nobody focuses on anything other than killing it so they get the one star legendary. It‚Äôs annoying cause you fail the event anyway.
---
I fight the queen then get the flux. I'm running a bloodied explosive .50 cal. I'm not useless, actually, I'm pretty damn useful. But what area is nuked still matters afterwards.
---
I did not know that, thanks.
---
I love this idea but as a rifle build I feel left out. Can‚Äôt wait until I can place beer bottles on fences and have some feats of accuracy
---
So many weapons in this game are absolutely trash, it's bewildering.
---
I still find merit in discussions, even if you're is acutely focused.
---
They're not useless.  They're just not useful to YOU.
---
High luck (20+) fills the crit VATS meter really fast (the bar is full in \~3 shots, without any related perks)
---
 Yeah but you can't use it. I will not run a Bloodied build as I like to stick knives in things. Some of those things hit like a truck but I can take a lot of damage.
---
 As the Adrenaline kicks in she gets into the 300 range and everything gets one shot. Ghoul hordes melt like the morning dew and I get shit on for hogging the pack. ;)
---
Usually a team if 3-4. One at train station, one at clubhouse and one at the row houses.
---
They wait for a new player to come in to trigger mobs, then swoop in to steal kills and farm legendaries.
---
They sell the legendaries online, for caps and preferably cash.
---
My level 160ish ass got killed by a level 20 mole rat because of the "you're stuck in a work bench, and when you exit the work bench, you're sucked back into the animation" bug the other day. That entire system needs to be completely over-hauled.
---
Console I take it?
---
They're so weak it's kind of agitating. I fired 40 or so 40mm grenades into a legendary yao guai earlier. Did such a small amount I just switch to my power sledge. No melee perks and was doing 2 or 3 times the damage perk hit. GG.
---
Hmm, even if we seem to be disagreeing about some points, if the devs fixed what we both see as "problems", we might both be happy, right?
---
For camp. Workshops have them......
---
Also, I'll drop my nukes wherever I please. I expect if you drop any you might do the same. Guys like you make me want to drop them square on prime, though with all your bitching.
---
I just found this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3bgy1/psa_intelligence_increases_xp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
It‚Äôs strange though because I have a low level, low INT build that I took through Whitesprings last night and saw no difference in XP compared to my above average INT build. 
---
Just another example of Bethesda‚Äôs communication problem.
---
Hahahhaha i knew they were used for something i have tons where do i use them?
---
If It does happen again i'll def be doing that.
---
the fat man and missile launcher need a damage buff
---
What are they under? Do you need to get plan first?
---
It's a typo by Bethesda. The standard combat rifle uses 45 ammo, and the prime plans unlock ultracite 45 ammo, but the prime receivers change the ammo type to ultracite 44 ammo.
---
One of those bugs that will probably never be fixed. You can work around it by learning the prime receiver plan for the 44 or Western revolver.
---
Implemented. I guess it's a necessary function introduced when they added item renaming but it may be tied to repair kits. 
---
Also affects the way to repair weapons at benches. There is an intermediary button prompt before you get the option to repair. 
---
Plenty of people are upset with this change on all levels.
---
The ultracite mod changes it to .44
---
They are in floor decorations, I don't recall getting a plan but there may be one....
---
Meh.
---
The mechanics are not deep enough (except in silly, meaningless areas like damage calculations) to support a reason to respec. To say nothing of the content.
---
Please let us turn up da dum de de dum de de dah dah!!..gets me pumped
---
I‚Äôd be for that. It should have Vendor Bot Wallace‚Äôs ‚Äú*soothing voice*‚Äù
---
Damn. Thanks for the info. I thought I‚Äôd lost my mind trying to figure out what happened.
---
Got it. I was already trying kiting a hound from huntersville but could never do it because of the terrain. That guy suggested explosive(great advice) but my hound followed me right at the behemoth.
---
The path i used started at the hunterville spawn. As soon as i had a hound i went up in the direction of the investigator cabin. Kept the lakes on my left because it's a mess with the hound. Then it's all down hill till the pond.
---
I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to and is a bug. You need to learn the .44 or Western Revolver Prime plan.
---
You mean like 1 star  "10% against squirrels" AWP? Yes pls give.
---
It's the event reward and not the drops from the creature(s). If I lose even one cow I seem to only get the pie recipe. All cows live and I get a new plan.
---
I'm not sure if you get a notification but I have heard this happening in the past, the caps end up getting lost. 
---
I'd be asking the guy for proof of his caps before hand though, he could be trying to scam you for more caps.
---
If you sell something for a value more than you have space to hold caps then the item sells for what you have space for. So if you have 24.5k and sell something for 1k, you‚Äôll actually only get 500c. Double check you cap pool. If it‚Äôs not 10k light then he didn‚Äôt get what you agreed to pay him.
---
In any case its his own fault, not yours.
---
it's happened to me several times as well wish I knew how to replicate it
---
I concur. I wish I could remember where I got mine from but I just know I didn't buy it.
---
Just making a suggestion, you do whatever you want buddy. Idk. Maybe people dont know they can fight her outside it and this is mostly for those people you obviously dont care about anyone but yourself
---
Well me on my character whenever i go unyielding wich raise my intelligence, i do notice a difference
---
Nah, and here's a reason why; it even respects the lore.
---
AK-47: Designed: 1946
---
AR15: Designed: 1956
---
Fallout divergence point: Shortly after 1945.
---
This means that AR15 might not even exist in the Fallout universe. The AK exists because it was so close to the divergence point.
---
I found a new 3 star AGL and took it to the queen. Maybe 2 minutes duration from 200%.
---
lol yep you're right
---
I agree, was a bit presumptuous on my part.
---
no it would just make the other caps dissappear but thats on him
---
Maybe that's what happened, although I didn't know it at the time. I'd never heard of this before. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Saw the exact same kind of thing happen, it cracked our shit up =D
---
What platform are you on?
---
Are you still on?
---
This is why I carry a RW super sledge on my low strength but wear PA bomber.
---
Use the pieces of the lesser tapes to help learn how to requisition better items, but it destroys the tape. I‚Äôm sure this can be retconned.
---
Juuuuunk. 0 caps.
---
As a sniper type, I'm interested in what the bow will bring to the table.  I'm hoping the bow and the shepherd's crook will be added to the legendary loot tables, because the crook would be a cool, musical option for my 2H melee guy, and the bow could be a great, viable option with AA, 2-shot, faster fire rate, etc.  There's just no reason to use a crafted version when I have an AA/E rifle or a AA/SS super sledge.
---
I mean, sheepsquatch quill bodkin arrows with poison damage must have crossed the devs' minds.  &gt;!They exist as ersatz poisoned throwing darts as a plan reward for completing Free Range.!&lt;
---
Thank you for the info. I really appreciate it!
---
It‚Äôs not new, been around since launch, but it‚Äôs pretty rare. Someone came up with a way to reliably induce it, though.
---
Yeah, I'm the one who made an original post on Reddit telling people what they should be doing...
---
Seriously, I just told you why we don't all do it your way. You obviously hadn't considered that people know they can spawn her the way you like and choose not to.
---
Why can‚Äôt I use it lol? I used it all day yesterday. I can take a ton of damage. My melee character has full cavalier, he takes 1 hp dmg per bit while sprinting, gun character is the same way only has full unyielding sentinel.
---
It‚Äôs not a good plan just a unique one
---
The horrific iron sight makes it a no-go for me, as much as I like the idea.  Even very low end modern crossbows have a picatinny rail for mounting optics.
---
I believe that‚Äôs enemy when spawn it‚Äôs just usual and then he become legendary and have that glowing effect for a moment. I think so, cuz I just killed enemy who started to become green and it should be legendary but I killed it too fast so it‚Äôs not Leg.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs supposed it be .45, but it‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs been there since launch
---
Yeah but the guy specifically said the sheepsquatch drops plans
---
I'm surprised how little difference I see with 15 less points without my Unyielding armor. I'm definitely not getting 2x the performance going from 15 to 30.
---
VATS accuracy the same, Can still sneak directly in front of enemies, and my crit meter feels the same.
---
I found a really awesome piece of Unyielding/+1 agility/harder to detect armor last night and I spent the evening thinking about it trying to sleep.... LOL. Does +1 agility and sneak even benefit someone with 30 agility?
---
Thanks tommy, strangely though I've come across enemies who were glowing green for some time before I even attacked them and then in comparison, I've come across another level 3 who was not glowing...it's happened a fair few times. I'm convinced there is something more to this lol
---
Frat house
---
Even the simple option of crafting either broadhead (bleed) or bodkin (AA) bolts would make a large difference.
---
I thought this was 2076 - the tricentennial
---
thanks
---
 Ok. Well have fun, I am. ;)
---
First time I found whitespring some player had a camp there and he was real nice and gave me plans and stuff, then I discovered a drawer and in it was around 16 fusion cores, oh Shit! I just had to take it, but after I felt bad so I gave him back the fusion cores to him in person..... Guess if I was surprised when my own fusion cores where gone ;)
---
Well, I wasn't expecting that. I apologize for getting all worked up over pretend money.
---
It was patched a good while back. It still happens a little bit though, just not permanent like before.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
No what you did was start getting rude. Thanks for the feedback

Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I am but I‚Äôd rather just collect it myself, want to try and be as self sufficient as possible (because of my sad RP rules)
---
Best part is the extra carry weight and melee damage
---
Haha. The Junkyard nearby has a concrete node.
---
Sorry, I just logged off for dinner. 
---
To find her, I went to the above location and server hopped.  It took 4 hops to find her.  This location in nice since you spawn in take a couple of steps forward.  You  can see if she is on the left side of the walk way or not.  If she is not there then hop to another server and repeat.
---
Oh yeah so It does now I remember! Thanks for that
---
Yup. And I‚Äôm seeing a stack of concrete bags in my head but can‚Äôt place where they are. My camp is just south of the trainyard so I‚Äôm around that area a lot.
---
Nukashine Tattoo Parlor is also a good spot
---
I know where there‚Äôs a ton near the savage divide but that‚Äôs way down past Charleston
---
I don't think you understand how history works.
---
In a parallel universe your parents used a condom so you will never exist in that universe.
---
The point of divergence in this scenario is the moment your parents had sex. 
---
It doesn't matter if right now is 2019 or 2076. If your parents used a condom in that parallel universe you will simply not exist in that universe. 
---
Same with the AR15. If it wasn't made in 1956 there's a very high chance it will never exist in the for you love so much in the fallout universe.
---
How about a crossbow that shoots chainsaws? Two birds with one stone.
---
HELL YEA I was mad as hell when I found out I couldn‚Äôt
---
Yo bro I‚Äôm so down if you‚Äôre still on

Watoga. A lot of the tables have them

I support this solution!

In the back yard of the Sons of Dane Compound [and all over the outpost tbh] there's empty bottles set up for target practice by the old biker inhabitants.
---
I will take that armor off your hand in a second, and I've already got a full suit of harder to detect.  I've got a bunch of sentinel and cavalier pieces to trade, and I'll do 3/1 for a max lvl Uny/AG/sneak piece, so long that it's leather/metal/combat.
---
High AG really comes into play after you've engaged the enemy in combat.  Staying hidden while snapping a picture and crouching directly in front of a deathclaw isn't massively difficult.  When you've already shot one of them, start backing away into a new position and a new enemy pushes you aside to get through a doorway is when high AG, armor mods and legendary effects really shine.
---
I think it's a system of diminishing returns.  The difference between 5 AG and 15 AG is probably much more significant than 15 vs 30.  That being said, if you're going for the gold standard, every little bit counts.
---
P R O T E C T
---
Yes...  that is what's on display here...
---
Lucky you! I tried 4 times before I gave up, it kept disappearing after death, wouldn't follow me long enough, fell into the water, and the last time it disappeared again right as I was at the road leading down to it. It just won't follow me for that long, for some reason.
---
Holy shit. I guess someone is always miles ahead of you.
---
Good to know üëç
---
yeh ive had this it only givesyou 1 location to respawn at.
---
usually whitepowder which costs 20+ caps
---
It might be the Lumber yard south of 76. I‚Äôm heading there now and will confirm either way.
---
Wait......they are adding BOWS TO THE GAME? How did I miss this?
---
They can't open it based on what others are saying..
---
Sorry, but I'm not really interested in your childish back and forth.
---
Do you have anything else to add?
---
Indeed.  The falloff on these weapons is really odd.  There's a point from about 160%-200% where they are amazing.  And then you'll be hard-pressed to get into the triple digits with it.
---
Still, the Vampire effect happens every time they hit now, so from a survivability standpoint, you're not going down as long as you remain in contact with something.
---
Well... This is fucking stupid. I have seen NO hate for trading on this sub?? And I'm fairly active. I've met some good people trading through here.
---
Cheese lives matter! üôÉ
---
I love repair kits.  I use them often.
---
Ive been seeing it for the last few days, only in Grassy areas.
---
Lady Janet's Soft Serve also has a fridge with a hefty sum of bottles.
---
Yeah, maybe people see something I don't, but I see most trading posts go ignored rather than called out.  Seems silly to change the rules to satisfy *that guy* who can't, you know, not click on stuff that doesn't interest them.
---
Modders..., smh
---
I mean it doesn't take a TSE to do ridiculous damage. I do more with a 1* bloodied handmade. But I like to bring random low levels to the spawn points, let them fight him, and then take it out when things start looking bad for them lol
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start
---
well I could understand if we had a broken window version and a normal version as you could help make a look or a design but all broken is sooo.....
---
I got hit hard and nearly died earlier because of the needles revolver spin animation that has to happen every time you equip the bloody thing. 
---
Please Bethesda, let us skip these animations.
---
Dang that sounds pretty cool, I would've tried to get a squatch radstorm picture first
---
Explosive weapons were meant to be better on cluster of mobs as a "constant dps" instead of a clear the room move (that i disagree since as you said they are heavy, expensive and pretty much useless)
---
Wish they just made them 10% slower and literally double or tripled the base dmg.
---
False look at new Vegas with the service rifle, marksmen carbine, and assault carbine, both clearly modeled after the ar15 but you could say the only existed in the west, or they were only supplied to the army in Alaska who was fighting the Chinese so they had only been spread so far out of Alaska. 
---
But there are holes in what I‚Äôm saying. but to what Ik it is lore friendly but would have to be changed cosmetically to fit the rest of f76 weapons. Also assault rifle could have taken the place of what could have been the ar15. 
---
On mobile so grammar will be poop
---
Top of the world 2nd floor is safe and has a shit ton
---
It's probably a mod. Typical. Well, unsubbing!
---
They called him a mad man
---
back in the beta the overseers boxes would become stash boxes - I ran up to it saw a bunch of items in it grabbed it all out ran off came back saw it again was like omg it keeps respawning.....
---
It wasn‚Äôt lumber yard. I can‚Äôt remember where I saw it. Sorry.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
No, I drop the holotsoe. Let them summon it themselves.
---
This is a good decision overall in that predators banned from the trading forums still operate here where people don‚Äôt know their reputation.  That imposes demands on a moderator‚Äôs time or leads to tears on the part of those who trade less.  I suggest the automod indicate the existence of the two primary trading subReddits.
---
Anyone downvoting that comment is a moron. AK47‚Äôs don‚Äôt even fire in a straight line because they‚Äôre made so shit. British army will tell you to stand still if you hear one being fired because they‚Äôre so inaccurate.
---
Pretty ballsy for a trader to act like an unprovoked ass.  What if someone searches for Fixer111 and asshole, or scam, or stole my stuff? They might find this and wonder if Fixer111 is blacklisted or would rip them off.  Also might wonder if they should give you 6k, since you got it for practically free.
---
That would suck...
---
Oh, how cute, childish threats!
---
Please, stop embarrassing yourself.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, if you‚Äôre on another system you may be still be first on PC or Xbox
---
Too late. Sorry to any that see this
---
Could you supply with a picture? Did it look along the lines of a ski outfit?
---
I did the same for the "Kill 5 Radscorpions in the Savage Divide" challenge. Just lured a Radscorpion horde from the Toxic Valley to the Divide and kill them there :-/
---
This. It's probably top 10 dumbest design choice for me. Like.. why?
---
A plan is not needed to craft moltovs, they are craftable from the start of the game. You can craft them at a tinkers workbench under grenades.
---
Try completing workshop defence events, they give a lot of different recipes/plans.
---
Omg I‚Äôm so dumb, been playing since day 1 forgot that grenades come from tinkerers and not chemistry table xDDD
---
You guys should also ban posts announcing SBQ fights. I mean why let this sub be a utility for this game at all?! Personally I think this place should only be used for "I haven't played this game for awhile what's changed?" posts.
---
I ended up ditching it for iron sights, bit easier to tell where my shot's gunna land but still a right pain
---
After 750 hours of play it's probably the best drop that I've gotten. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it just yet but if you're on PC I will be sure to let you know if I decide to trade it.
---
Most top tier items are worth more the 25k caps. If you don't understand what he is asking for you don't do much trading. I lost my BE hunting rifle to a scammer a few days ago. After 100+ trades it was only a matter of time I guess. I would love to see some sort of trade feature but I suspect it's too complicated. they would end up breaking the  trade system to try and implement something like that.
---
Lol, I've done it twice.
---
I'm on mobile so if won't let me add a picture but I think it might have been a ski outfit.
---
why iron fist 3 and not rank 1 of iron first iron fist expert and iron fist master for 30% rather than 20%?
---
~25-40 caps, they're fairly easy to find if you know the spots.
---
Are you using rifleman perks? The pipe revolver benefits from both gunslinger and rifleman, so between the both of them the base damage gets jacked way up. I'm sure they'll patch it in day, as it's the only pistol that uses both.
---
I‚Äôm new to the game have a few why shouldn‚Äôt I use them? Also do I just have to wait for the quest fix a tower to use one?
---
I just unloaded 91 of them on some random level 17 who showed up at my camp, after he not only brought a Sheepsquatch over but asked me for free power armor.
---
No.
---
I'm going head to Watoga and test this out with some different pieces.
---
it already exist, get one with the legendary quad prefix
---
I've also noticed that the durability of my items (especially my super sledge) has also been lowered. And although the basic repair kits cost 50 atoms each, which can be annoying when your weapon breaks, the improved are dropped by scorchbeast queens.
---
PC
---
I looked it up and found a Reddit post saying it's the White Powder jumpsuit but it comes from an event in the savage divide. Doesn't say which event
---
And ella ames‚Äô bunker, found 24 there.
---
Alright, because I'm pretty certain there is a blue varient of the outfit with the brand logo.
---
Cannot raid stashes its mostly a greifing thing or in survival ppl will destroy ur stuff cause u get no bounty from it. I do it alot in survival
---
Lore-wise assault and marksmen carbine are modeled after a paratrooper-oriented marksman rifle.
---
I'm not really a gun expert but wikipedia lists the AR-10 as a Designated Marksman Rifle which is the weapon before the AR-15 and a bit of search on google says that the AR-15 isn't really a DMR.
---
Sure the assault carbine and the AR-15 may look similar but they are more like cousins rather than twins.
---
(yeah i know i'm nitpicking, it's because i don't like OP for this comment; too much patriotism)
---
&gt;Because Bethesda makes the AK (handmade) the best rifle when all real Americans from West Virginia know the AR or variants (M4, M16, etc) are really the best rifles
---
Yes but maybe they have changed the durability rates slightly, making items break faster... which means more repairs are needed and more people are likely to purchase repair kits. That would make sense.
---
So, you feel it's the same?
---
OK that's REALLY weird.  Maybe a glitch?  From a RP perspective, it makes no sense for her to be locked-up in armor at all, especially with her mask.  Maybe a spit hood.  LOL and she had a 10mm gun on her with ammo this time.
---
It should say you can‚Äôt rest when enemies are nearby like in previous games
---
How the hell did the hound follow you that far? Twice now the hound has given up half way to that pond for me.
---
They didn't nerf durability of anything.
---
The loot isn't worth it basically
---
The current system is only fit for player vending. Nothing else.
---
We need to be able to vend  from our stash and barter from our inventory.
---
Fissure Prime. I nuked the place but only one other person showed up. We knew we can't kill the queen and she can't kill us, so we focused on the adds she spawned. I leveled up from 194 to 197 in 30 minutes.
---
That would make sense, but we can't be entirely sure. It might just be that the emphasis on repairing makes it seem that our items may break quicker. But I can totally see that Bethesda might of tweaked the rates.
---
Okay?
---
Probably has 15 base Int. Full Unyielding would add +15, egg head mutation adds +6, and shielded vault suit adds +2 for a total of 38.
---
It‚Äôs going to be incredible self healing but poor damage without some cheesing
---
Can I call them in at will though? Or only when the quest appears? 
---
It‚Äôs be nice if it was like a CoD care package like if you‚Äôre in the sticks and want some ammo.
---
Wow. That‚Äôs how survival is? A level 8 can kill a level 200???
---
Or just let us hide the unwanted perk cards. It'll allow us to switch the perks much quicker without having card presets.
---
Yes, yes, yes.....i have to repair my handmade after 1 run on the Free Range event.....which isnt that intense of a fight
---
. It used to make it through almost am entire silo run, and most of the SBQ fight
---
The scrap bonus is almost useless. The difference between ~14 and ~32 intelligence when scrapping a mini gun with Scrapper goes from 25 steel to 26 steel
---
Red rocket garage doors are red aren't they?
---
That would most likely happen to have been me!
---
Feels the same to me
---
Always breaks fast if I don‚Äôt have White Knight on
---
Isn't that pretty much what the atom shop is?
---
In fallout lore, the sr11, a variation of the early M series (otherwise known as the service rifle) was the primary service rifle for american troops up until the early 2000's. It was then trouped by the R91 (otherwise known as the assault rifle from fallout 3) taking its place as the main service rifle for troops. The reason the sr11 isnt as commonly found on the east coast is because while it still had continued military service, it was really only issued to the national guard in the midwest and west coast. The R91 is more commonly found in the east because they were manufactured and produced by stent security solutions, a civilian arms company located on the east coast.
---
Glad to see a similar experience!
---
Why not just trade in-game to a player or vendor?
---
Why are people using the game to earn income instead if playing the game, as designed?
---
What 2nd/3rd world shithole do these people live in?

Coule be helpful
---
Yep it'an event reward from any event in the savage divide but their drop rate is like 0.5% from. They are almost the rarest item in the game.
---
More Resistance = more HP
---
It‚Äôs a sound affect for the new plague walker skin. But for some reason it‚Äôs on all power armor.
---
Happens to the best of us bud
---
Every single online game has issues at launch. You expected otherwise from a Bethesda game?
---
Literally the best thing about PA.
---
Nope, haven't noticed any difference. But I carry three guns and three melee weapons and swap between them all depending on the situation. I also have three ranks of makeshift warrior and gunsmith and white knight. 
---
They would have to REALLY change it for me to notice.
---
You have to go to a relay tower and plug it into the termnial.  Can't use it from anywhere.
---
Yes it is similar but all of the skins and outfits currently in the Atomic shop are officially created internally by Bethesda. 
---
I'm suggesting that they expand it to allow player created mods to be added to the shop as well.
---
How many things in game make sense by that logic?
---
Replace it with something more iconic appalachian like
---
P R O T E C T A N D S E R V E
---
This guy maths
---
I find the Mini Nuke does the most damage of any weapon..... to myself. I've killed myself numerous times when using that. I had the explosive perks for additional damage and additional area of effect. That is a dangerous weapon, for the owner.
---
Ah, I'm with you! Yeah, could be interesting. Like Warframe and the Tennogen. Yeah, that could be pretty cool!
---
Damn! You are right. the Silhouttes do seem like the vault boy and the Overseer. I hope she didn't die in one of her Holotapes.
---
I was never able to interpret them very well, so I never used em.  Not a thing I miss tbh
---
Oh alright. Sounds wonderful.
---
I have 332 of these saved up, too bad they‚Äôre worthless
---
Got it.
---
only if you wanna shell out 3x the price for anything, tse handmades are asking for 12k on there, market and xbox lfg are going for 4-5k
---
Maybe you're swinging too hard? You should choke up on the handle a bit.
---
I need to know do you have the marine armor helmet?
---
Yeah what's that ? Most people aren't dicks .. just a few we run in that give a bad name or give high levels a bad name.
---
I would of totally blocked and reported everyone of them and stayed to kill everything I could so they couldn't. As long as you have pacify mode on, they can't do squat to you.
---
That's a pretty interesting idea that could be compared to the steam workshop where you can download player made cosmetics. Do you think it should cost atoms or real cash though?
---
I know this is super old but where did you place the camp to spawn in the tree. Please DM
---
Pvp engaged. Fatman and 40 mini nukes getting use finally  lol
---
I still do this when Im not paying attention... I'll loot a couple of rows of ammo before I realize its my stuff.
---
I mostly only use basic attacks when attacking, I save the AP for running away to heal.
---
Just keep walking in and out of the edge of the zone usually does it.
---
Why didn't you just kill the ones in the whitespring golf club bathroom?
---
That's the Whitepowder jumpsuit, I have one. It's pretty nice
---
I've been seeing more and more there recently
---
You're going to get rolled so hard the first time you run into a higher level zone spawn. üòÅ
---
I wish you the best of luck!
---
AR like most US weaponry was designed as a gold mine for the arms companies while AK was designed to survive sands muds and nukes. You need to fill your backpack with lubes and repair kits if you run a direct-impingement AR build. In a post apocalyptic world? Probably not very viable.
---
What about your armor? I noticed it on my armor, not so much on my weapons... but probably due to what you said I have Makeshift maxed out and use 2-3 weapons too.
---
The funny thing is that probably happens even with downward swings
---
The dxgi.dll from SFE needs to be in the root fallout 76 folder where the game executable is; not the data folder.
---
You can track down a cargobot and the vertibot convoy that's carrying a nuclear keycard. That worked for me.
---
Take into consideration the game does have horrid framerate, when compared to other games. Its choppy for my too, hurts my eyes sometimes. But you get used to it and it does smoothen out over time
---
I usually don't use White Knight, unless to repair armor pieces at the workbench. But everything is breaking so fast, I had to repair almost every armor piece 2x yesterday and I didn't even play that much. I usually repair my gear once every 2 days or so. But then again, I don't get hit too much.
---
The idea is to use Atoms, yes.
---
Crafted weapon duration benefits up to 20 INT.
---
Found weapon condition benefits from up to 20 luck.
---
You're wrong. 
---
You're welcome.
---
Apparently the games internal environments (anywhere you enter with a loading screen) is actually housed somewhere near white powder in the games coding, must have something to do with it

Its one of those turret alien mannequins from Nuka World. They were found in the Galaxy section of the park.
---
Yeah the enclave bot event seems to spawn friendly enemies constantly for me.  Least they can be shot
---
especially the bathroom with the Med-X on the ground level
---
The one I found was a bullet sponge, after a hundred rounds, I switched to melee and still took a while.
---
Yeah those posts should be directed at r/Market76
---
Last week I was looking at my stash and thought I was still checking a vendor's inventory... I was baffled that someone had sold such great weapons/armor to the vendor-bot. Turns out I'm just dumb.
---
When I started I put stuff in the stash thinking I could use it to trade things with my friends. I was like, "there should be some frags and stims in there now" and my buddy was like. "Nah. Just some junk." And wasnt till my other friend got on and saw what we were doing, that he told us and just laughed.
---
Might have been on your server as I saw someone there on the map not going anywhere and I couldn't figure out why someone would just be hanging out there (rarely check the daily)
---
Enemy NPCs getting disconnected from the server now
---
They go flying upwards in any way the animation shows (left, right, upwards, and downwards.)
---
If you're on PC... add to your custom ini: bPlayMainMenuMusic = 0
---
If console, you have my sympathies.
---
So whoever has the unarmed perks etc will win
---
45 AA Gatling, no doubt.
---
Lvl 45 AA is the best choice in that situation.
---
I saw with my own eyes a 1 star ghoul do that green skin effect and turn into a 3 star legendary. It only dropped some 1 star garbage though. Maybe I should have let it "bake" a bit longer.
---
I think he means, if you pick a card to trade, then the card you get in return is useless to you, then you would just trade it again and again until you get what you want. Which I agree would be abused. So 2 for 1, or maybe just a 50% chance you don't get a card.
---
Why don't you give some specs of who you are as a player. Your level, type of build, what your expectations are, and if you have a mic.
---
I‚Äôm looking for people to play with, what is your gamer tag?
---
It‚Äôs this kind of idiocy....
---
Sounds like q bug then.  Maybe relog and check?

I thought we all did that at point.

I will be sure to add those in the future! Always fun with more people!
---
I have a heavy build but had no idea about this perk, stabilized! wow! thanks for sharing, never thought to look under Intelligence for a Heavy Gunner perk. I use the Luck One Gun Army but adding Stabilized will really add some punch
---
Lots of fun thanks for joining me.
---
I get pretty decent exp by claiming workshops and doing defend events.
---
Pvp isn't usually an issue, but sometimes I end up on am aggressive server(CURSE YOU dr_octogon!), so I just server hop.
---
how do you access it?
---
I don't know if this a problem anyone else has but my character will FREQUENTLY go right back into a crafting bench just after the exit animation stops and it was just an annoyance until a couple ghouls came and attacked me while I was using a weapons bench and it took 20 years to go through the exit animation, then immediately another two decades for the enter animation and 1 and 19 more years for the exit animation again and I ended up fucking dying
---
Walls too.
---
So Gatling Plasma doesn't benefit from Heavy Weapons perks? I'm alway carrying a MiniGun, TS Gatling, and a Gatling Plasma.
---
Yes. Although I don't recall the actual name or level it was a sheepsquatch fighting mole miners in the mire(?)  The miners did well to keep it's attention away from me. I usually rely on shotgun/enforcer to kneecap enemies and then switch to melee. Against the sheepsquatch it seemed to only slow it down, only a couple of times I felt it was incapacitated enough to move in with my Grognak.
---
Lol I‚Äôve done the same thing like 50 times, I recognise my stash being mine now because of the fact most of the items are Chems and rotten food.
---
It definitely scales with the damage perks. To check the stabilized perk look at the accuracy before stabilized is swapped on and after. If accuracy increases, it'll have the armor penetration.
---
\*whom.
---
Is anybody else getting weird afterimage smearing on vegetation too? I noticed recently that whenever it seems to rain, or in general after a while, vegetation and plants have this weird afterimage bug whenever you're looking at them and moving your view around.  You'll see whatever plants in view, whether it was bushes, or tree leaves leaving a secondary image trailing behind your view on these same objects.
---
Happenening all week for me except last night when 3 scorch beasts and a legendary sheep squatch decided they hated me lol.  
---
To the other guy caught in that with me. What a fight. Thanks we kicked ass
---
It should just be food water and medical items in my opinion. Maybe some clothing too. These are supposed to be emergency government drops so it makes no sense to me that they would contain any weapons and ammo. But I think they should contain about 5 of each of the items I mentioned above.
---
High level Weapons, ammo and armour should be found in the kovac drops. Seeing as they are harder to get. About 2 weapons and plenty ammo for them, maybe some plans and weapon mods too as a rare bonus.
---
See, it's odd. I've done leveling in watoga a lot. I've had a full unyielding set, and power armor on, and I never saw a difference in experience. Everything I read said that there is no XP affect on intelligence. A level 50 protection gives me 110ish XP, either way. 
---
Today I go to test it, and in power armor I get 110, like normal. Out of power armor, I get about double. What's interesting is that it's the double XP weekend, so I should get double IN power armor as well.
---
I thought the overseer had more of a French twist or bun hairstyle. 
---
However I am convinced that the overseer is still out there. I don't think the B&amp;B tape is her last. Hopefully if they do add an npc, it'll be her and she'll have more for us to do.
---
They are trading for other stuff/caps, not real money. Also, where is your evidence for this bold accusation?
---
Hold xbox button till it vibrates, then tap the view button ( the one w/3 lines) 
---
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/ease-of-access/use-magnifier
---
Seems to me a simple ‚Äúconfirm trade?‚Äù pop up would do the trick.  Items are marked for trade.  One player might swap two items for one, in this example.  My two items are offered.  Other player offers their one.  I hit confirm.  The other player hits confirm.  Then the transaction happens.
---
I found one fighting mole miners with rocket launchers. Some said in another post that they spawn randomly where Deathclaws spawn.
---
I did this during the stress test, if I remember correctly I thought it was an overseer stash and not mine so I sold it all.
---

The 3 possible locations are southern belle motel, big freds bbq shack, and grove family cabins
---
Have you gotten the egghead mutation yet?
---
I appreciate that, a trading discord would be awesome to have also
---
More importantly though, I was looking more for just a social/grouping type of discord where I could join up with people easier.
---
Egg head mutation increases it by either 6 or 8 I believe
---
Mute the tv?
---
oh yeah forgot to mention that. i got egg head, mars, and tryna get herd mentality mutation. i got class freak on so the negative effects are super low
---
Haha yeah, that would be similar. I got a bloodied ffr with 10% aim dmg, looking for another 20bolts in a feeder let me play and laugh like this fella. Lol
---
it gives me 6, i would use that perk strange in numbers to get a bit more but i heard its buggy af still
---
Best single location i can think of is when you take the elevator to the top of the monorail tower north of lucky hole mine, theres like ten bags up there iirc.
---
Darn it. I had that happen to me last night. My main weapons vanished after server kicked me. Completely paranoid now what else might dissapear.
---
I have a mic, im level 60, i play with a riffle and i want some people to join to do some event or some farming. I also have a french accent when i talk

Yeah, the player invited to trade, then cancelled and invited to join team. The other player left after we started the trade dialog. Got an xbox message asking for junk. I asked what kind and got a reply of all kinds. I always try to help people when I can, so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. As crazy as it was, it was one of the wildest interactions I‚Äôve had yet in the game.
---
Franky_boy14
---
I found my first wild one today.
---
Was running to a Distand Thunder when I came across a mister handy with 3 cows, interacted with the handy because I never saw that before, and then the big boi showed up.
---
Just pure griefing. There is becoming fewer and fewer ways people can grief and soon camp destruction will be removed as well. As said before griefers rely more on an unfair advantage or unsuspecting player to get off on than a fair fight. They get the latter in survival so the need to go to adventure to get the former (assuming you're in adventure) Maybe they're aware of the pending removal of being able to destroy a players camp and trying to get in their last few kicks. Whatever it may be, be prepared for open season on workshops when it does.
---
yes any time it's "no name" its excavator
---
Had it where I couldn't spawn anywhere on the map. I had to disconnect and lose my junk (600+ steel from WEST TEK).
---
You could always have both? No reason to get rid of repair kits just because you don't use them.
---
Some people have no interest in the cosmetic items in the atomic store, the repair kits will give them players use for all the atoms they've earned.
---
And adding a re spec to the atomic store would absolutely be pay to win.
---
Maybe a better solution which would also make use of the perks you don't want, is that you can at any time, move 1 special point at the expense of 1 perk card, which would be destroyed in the process. Making perk packs somewhat more useful.
---
Great reply...this was my thinking earlier too
---
I lost a bunch of Berry mentats or sold them while drunk. Either way they are gone. Haha.
---
Take that with a grain of salt, this guy is obviously angry and exaggerating, you don‚Äôt have to worry about duping it‚Äôs not an issue, the optimization is an issue, which needs to be addressed by Bethesda soon. 
---
Duping is a buzzword in this sub, if anyone does something you don‚Äôt like or has something you don‚Äôt they‚Äôre a griefer/duper
---
Yes. But I also have to agree, Bethesdas previous smaller maps, weren't great.
---
It's strange how great minimaps like this have been a lost art.
---

Unyielding armour is probably the key
---
Exactly! =]]
---
I was literally just thinking This when I levelled up today. I considered picking stormchaser now that nuke zones are classed as rad storms. But I wasn't sure if it was just for challenges so I didn't take that perk.
---
Have you tried using stormchaser in a nukezone? Does it work?
---
If not, I think it should be changed to make it so. I've not encounters enough storms to make it a worthwhile choice at the moment.
---
Yes and the mysterious person who attacked her as well. Unless it was some random raider, but i always got the impression we werent far behind the OS timewise
---
I find it interesting that they wanted to add an ear tag. I mean, it's a detail that could easily be left out, I think...
---
Not rare
---
i got a chest piece 2* with uny and +1 int, ive been busting my balls all over the market to buy one but either it has the damn sentinel or cavalier perk that i dont want cause people would immediately or someone outbids by like thousands for it. i just want the legs and arms :(
---
I have a sneak sniper build so when I encountered a level 80 in the wild I got super lucky. He got stuck on some rocks so 200+ ammo later headshot after headshot I finally downed him. I wouldn't have done it by myself otherwise.
---
Ah!! Cool find! I mean, still weird, why would they use the same number?
---
Very common available at almost any raider vendor
---
We know, but thanks for contributing
---
maybe in the future. some of the weapons need more mods, like the .50 cal machine gun and the crossbow
---
Look it up on disboard.net or just Google fallout 76 discord.
---
I know of one called the Vault that's pretty good and they do some other games, too.
---
They even have a fallout tabletop game going on called vaults and vertibirds
---
He didn't use Ear Protection.
---
She's still alive somewhere, since you get a new holotape from her at one of the silo entrances after laumching a nuke.
---
what system
---
The Honorable Few, both on discord as well as Xbox. If you'd like to play with someone I'm normally online when work allows gt: vegitastorm
---
My uncle had an ak he stored in a locker. It would get rusted out and he would kick the action open, be good to go. They were built for abuse (tolerances were loose).
---
I had a glitch when the server was super laggy and I tried to pick one up but was at max.   It said i had hit max weight.     
---
Somehow it dumped all of my ammo on the gun i was using.    4k .556 dissapeared.
---
To me I haven't see any difference at all. Leveling a new toon with the double XP weekend so no maxed ranked cards yet. My weapons break so slowly (sniper build). And my hazmat suit has not been repaired since it got it 3 days ago @at 30. And this is all since the patch. So am wondering if your useing * items that have bonuses on them like TS or lightweight?
---
I actually like that it was a detail they put in. This was just a normal sheep til nukes and radiation, maybe even some FEV turned it into this monster.
---
PS4 sir
---
Congrats, man. I tried to take him down solo at lvl 39 with a Combat Shotgun. 10 minutes, 5 stimpacks, and 120 shotgun rounds later (and even a few minutes with my spiked ski sword), I realized I am not yet equipped to deal with the Sheepsquach myself.
---
I'd have got my tesla rifle out and turned everything into an unlootable ashpile.
---
Well I don‚Äôt have a problem with them selling repair kits in the atomic shop, however if they were going to sell tier 3 legendary‚Äôs I would have a problem with it.  My main problem with Bethesda at this point is all these patches they have implemented and they really have not fixed all the glitches and the crashes I‚Äôm still experiencing those as I‚Äôm sure many other people are also!  They were so concerned with catching cheaters why not be more concerned about fixing the game mine crashed three times today already
---
Yessss. I put the prime on my .50. It is pretty nuts. The crossbow is just fun. It's a bit slow. But a 20bolt feeder and a 25%ffr would be great. Lol. I'm okay if it counts as automatic weapons. Lol
---
It would be cool to craft your legendary rather than hope for luck of the draw.  Like tge difference between jumping in a toxic vat for random mutations or using serums for an exact build.
---
It's probably figured out for a long time but do these 5 stars under new features in nuclear winter mean we are getting 5 star legendaries in summer/from raid? Also good catch with the overseer. I was hoping there would be alive people in vault 64 once i found out there's no way inside yet.
---
I don't remember, but does strange in numbers increase effects of mutations?
---
You can
---
That drop point always has weird stuff around it, I'd rather have cows than when the mannequins spawn in the same pattern !
---
Are you being serious?
---
Same here....those dummies give me the creeps
---
Lol you‚Äôre dumb man, you read the rules, accepted them, lost all your shit, and now you‚Äôre complaining? It‚Äôs SURVIVAL you obviously didn‚Äôt comprehend the rules, and that‚Äôs why you got robbed. 
---
Use your brain kiddo
---
Well I feel dumb. How do you do it?
---
Can you tell me where to find the recipe for nuka dark? I have party boy3 and cola nut too so I'd like to make use of this drink.
---
Did you know that Sweetwater special blend is affected by party boy aswell? 6 perception for 1 hour! And best thing is, when you drink normal alcohol the effects of Sweetwater stay active.
---
My bet is she is the first ghoul. Who then will be in the next installment
---
I remember doing something like this, then getting disconnected. Then go to my stash and see it was empty and thought there was some sort of glitch when I dc'ed but hey at least I got all that other loot to replace it with!
---
I find this interesting. I‚Äôm sure the resounding answer will be that they had no claim and it doesn‚Äôt matter, but this was a thing many years ago on EverQuest. If you went into a zone and saw a group, you wouldn‚Äôt even think twice about stopping to set up camp.
---
Step one: pick up item. Step two: inspect item. Step three: clear/rename item name. Step four: rename item.
---
Good trade my friend +karma
---
by like 25 percent. think you can have it only one star i believe
---
Thanks.
---
It's hard to get the intelligent crowd here to waste their time replying to you, so it works best if you challenge them. Gotta out smart these smarty pants type.
---
I did the same sort of thing early on. I took a workshop after whoever had it originally left the game. He had used the foot locker stash box. I knew players some times left stuff they didn't need in public containers like lunchboxes and suitcases so I thought I'd found a foot locker like that. I figured it out partway through cleaning it out when I pulled out the same few legendries I was saving until I leveled up and could equip them.
---
I've got a few that inspired builds. Which is literally what Godd wanted, lol
---
"Sleep little baby, don't say a word..."
---
No it cant.
---
It's more like why not.
---
F4 Far Harbour had two photographs, one was found on some blog. Never found out if the other was found as well.
---
If they have a number or readable bar code in game, they could people are going to google for it.
---
Odd how no one yet has been triggered by this. 
---
https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/0187123/top/
---
THAT might have not been visble yet when they choose to include the original number from the stock photo. Hell they might even remove it because hurr hurr can't make any references to political or idiological things.
---
Not gonna lie done this before. I play solo and went into some guys base, just saw a box and started grabbing shit. Was amazed at how much shit was in there but was posted when I got back to base and couldn't build anything with what I got.
---
We all did this during the BETA
---
Nope. I never used them because they were so bad they were useless.
---
Robots and nuke zone ghouls on my server
---
No should be the other way round, make workshops produce quicker and store more.  Camp units are fine as they are.
---
There's already very little reason to use the workshops, so making the extractors you find out in the wilds better isn't a good move.
---
Damn Nukashine
---
I know there is a setting.. I mentioned it in my post..
---
On ps4 I've had a few game times were the server is a little laggy. But no issues like that. Have you tried to power cycle router?
---
Ive had assaultrons just form at the end of silos and then die two seconds later. It happened with the assaultron in burrows too. I dont think this is the only reason this is happening.
---
There's a reliable sheepsquatch spawn at the rest area at the bottom of the hill by the investigators cabin, which is right next to my CAMP, so i run into him all the time now. He is one tough bastard and I'd probably put him probably in between a deathclaw and a mirelurk queen in terms of sheer toughness. I don't find him quite so deadly as the queen (so long as you keep your distance) but he's still a pretty spongy guy.
---
Also.. Whining? I was just stating an observation. Calm down.
---
I need to complete the quest, so I dont have to listen to her everytime I log in.
---
Does the game alert you of the event if you're not near where it starts?
---
Apparently, even though it works for the challenges it does not work for Storm Chaser.
---
I speculated that logically because of how they worded the patch notes that it would mean Nuke Zones are classified as Rad Storms. So again, logically, Storm Chaser should work right? Then another poster commented that it didn't work for them and they were dismayed by this.
---
So I do hope they could at least make this little change because frankly it's just down there as one of the most useless perks imo with how rare rad storms and rain occurs in the game.
---
I've only ever gotten about 3 single that I actually wanted.
---
We need a trade in system, or a perk prestige system.
---
How do you think we got vendor bots up and running to sell our pilfered wares?
---
I think you will see it's made of black titanium - which are excavator mods .
---
Scoping out Blackwater Mine, see three mole miners, then they suddenly die and collapse.
---
BWAAAAA HA HAA ROTFL!!!
---
Each time you level past 50 you are given the option to move a perk point or select a perk card.
---
I left the mothman museum and had a trail of them every time I turned around... Figured the mothman was trolling my overweight ass as I struggled south.
---
Yeah I read the rules, I just complain when the game breaks. I had 356 total and lost them all in one death. I have have issues when the game is broken.
---
Read the post kiddo
---
Well, that explains what the quills are for.
---
Well that's an intresting opinion. You sure there aren't Chinese servers?
---
Assuming AA has been fixed for energy weapons.
---
Not in these instances.   I‚Äôm referring to when you happen upon him not the herding Brahmin event.   When you do the herding event it alerts you the same as starting any event/quest.  But in these instances it‚Äôs just out in the wasteland.  Same as encountering any other enemy
---
I read this as shart,üòÜ which could be a projectile.
---
next up the skull and fur!
---
Props to you. Very nicely done
---
Yes that is exactly what i meant, people would just trade away a card they dont want. And then if they dont get a card they want then they would trade away that new card.  And theyd just repeat that over and over, which would be abusing the system
---
I had an experience dealing with a Sheepsquatch. I was fixing the Scorched detectors, and had taken down two Wendingos. All of a sudden, I hear a loud howl, turn around, and a legendary Sheepsquatch was right behind me. Took all the ammo I had to take it down.
---
If you think it's loud, try destiny 2... Muted it's still loud as fuck.
---
Go through my trash cans....oh wait you mean in game!
---
I run the Fallout 76 video club... I have a mic and the people who play with me all have mics...  but join us Dookiestorm is my SN
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Thanks for karma..I think you need to add my name though..it auto fills if you press the @key
---
I kinda hope we get a Compound bow so we can actually customize it with mods and stone skins.
---
I'm pretty sure steel in qty of 30 is only 1.5 weight (as opposed to 3.0)
---
If i remember right events only trigger when a player is close enough to load the area hence the fast traveling and getting an event appearing
---
The skull is used for the melee weapon. The fur isn't protected from auto-scrapping so I don't think it has a use.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
So is that how it works in real life? You do your workout and feel like carrying a load of extra stuff on your back for an hour? No, of course it's the opposite. You need to rest after a work out, so I dont like this idea, I'll stick to eating steak and geting in my power armour.
---
Couldn't agree more most rad perks are trash in the game except rad sponge witch is 3pts and better than 4pts rad resist. Rad resist and storm chaser are a joke. Why should I have to wear a hasmat suit or PA. Rad resist 4 a perk should be better than a trash item I can pick up for free all over.
---
When you going to be on?
---
Hmm a good post but god damn there's a lot of negativity inside.
---
I was working on a heavy weapons explosive build. I was estimating decent numbers until I found out you cannot sneak attack with a rocket launcher. I assume that is the same for all explosive weapons. 
---
Black powder weapons have similar damage to the explosive weapons. However, Black powder weapons can sneak attack AND head shot. The bonus damage from stacking those two blows explosives out of the water.
---
The only good thing explosives has going for it is the Fatman. The base damage on that bad boy makes it the strongest critical hit weapon in the game. It has 460 base damage at level 50. Stacking Better Criticals, blight soup, and eagle eyes on a legendary critical Fatman multiplies critical damage by 2.35x. That is 1,081 pure damage. Cannot be reduced (except for the BS PVP one-shot protection).
---
Nah, theres plenty of stash space as it is.
---
It would create too much competition. Players are willing to make cool skins for free. You won't have a reason to buy the 1000 atom fat man skin in the atom shop if somebody releases a pack of universal skins for maybe 300.
---
Not sure why the downvote, I agree!
---
Not sure came to Reddit for the answer as well lol
---
Oh cool, I get it too, my specs are little below minium requirements.
---
That‚Äôs not broken that‚Äôs how it works, like I said you read em but you didn‚Äôt comprehend
---
Or it could be like one of the ghoul hordes I did. I cleared all the wrong hordes then finally found the right one and it was lead by a 3* legendary ghoul. It was level 3.
---
You can't "transfer all" out of stash. Only transfer "all junk" into stash.
---
They legit did an update reducing amount of aid items dropped. Don't just spew nonsense if you don't know what you're talking about.
---
It would be nice to be able to discard, shuffle, prioritize, favorite, trade...something.
---
The difference between 10 and 15 is useless. The table posted in the guide says 10 is 60% yield while 15 is 66% yield.
---
It goes like this, 0%, 20%, 33%, 40%, 46%, 50%, 53%, 56%, 58%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 64%, 65%, 66%.
---
After 5 points the return is just so little per point. Int is just so garbage as far as passive bonuses go.
---
Dirt common.
---
I did though, just today.  The first time I saw it was a few weeks ago, after the camera dailies started but before the camera itself was released.  I was going to see if I could find a non-broken ProSnap camera to see if it worked as a camera when the release happened.
---
lv 57.. I got 3 cards im using in packs...
---
Agree.
---
He probably has high intelligence.
---
It's quite an old bug.
---
I got the cards swiped one went to get the other swiped it and nothing happened.. can you help me out?
---
Extractors are boring...this is the fun way to stock up on aluminum.  :)
---
Ye its definitely the tankiest enemy in the game i'm running a bloodied build with a bloodied explosive handmade arguably one of the highest dps weapons in the game took me around to full clips to the head to kill it using VATS and crits... NOTHING in the game survives that long for the sake of comparison it takes me 5-8 rounds to kill a level 80 scorchbeast without sneak.... this one took around 60 its insanely tanky
---
I'm on ps4.. strange no quest line showed up?
---
If you're stepping down are we getting any new moderators in your place?
---
You're literally the only moderator that ever even comes to this subreddit out of the entire mod team we have. And even then, you don't have that many comments/posts here.
---
I still think the mod team doesn't give two shits about fallout 76. So why should they be moderators for the sub just because they're also mods on /r/fallout? They don't even do their jobs here.
---
Just directions on what i need to do would be awesome! Please xD I've been struggling for 4 hours!!
---
Ew!! What a waste? Why didn't you just get a Ps4 you it actually has exclusives right? Good luck playing God of War or Horizon or Red Dead on that shit
---
At will. Any relay tower
---
I‚Äôve always been able to sell them for 500
---
Out of curiosity, what's INT really do in 76? Why you after so much of it?
---
