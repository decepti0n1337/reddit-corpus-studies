Such a disappointment for an old meta
---
---
---
What post? And it's ok if it was removed. I'm not mad or anything :)
---
No idea but they were a bit glitchy so not sure if they were supposed to be in there or not. I know there are usually a couple of ghouls in the basement but I did not expect them to turn into a murdering rad horde
---
Huh only thing that gets close for me is plasma grenades... Though still quicker to shoot ghouls then predict where they going
---
EXACTLY, their ass anyway
---
Maybe she finally shook those nightmares.
---
How is dps the problem? Maybe for bosses I'd switch to something else but it seems fine for most all other content and events 
---

---
I used it in daily ops today and had a great time lol
---
I've noticed if you sit on the arch ways that over look the pond just as you walk down the stairs leaving the court yard enemies literally don't even move so you could literally just afk the event if you wanted.
---
Seems WAY better
---
It's really not bad at all to destroy someone's camp. You can just repair all at te camp table.
---
I only nuke peoples camp if they take my workshop. They either log out and give it back or lose their camp.
---
Lmao or found a band
---
The ultra light mods are at the bottom of Reg‚Äôs inventory. With the new war grieve mods.
---
Isn‚Äôt them pushing it back and releasing it all at once so that it can be bigger?
---
He‚Äôs not my amigo, mate
---
Make sure you run "Blocker" minimum my man or you gonna get melt, don't make the mistake to underestimate this perk card. 
---
You don't really need "Scattershot", in my opinion. Personally i run a Bloodied combat shotgun ( that i'm thinking to turn automatic, i don't really need it, but i wanna try ) and i'm not carrying more than 2 shotguns...because i just don't need it. Think about it man ! üëç
---
They actually fixed that? Jesus didn't see it in the patch notes... About bloody time
---
After scrips and my 1400 caps I just drop extra legendaries. They aren't worth hoarding.
---
Immunity from random enemies, and more build space, I guess.
---
I don't really know if I'd use them though.  Having to load in between places would be kind of inconvenient.  Hopefully we'll be allowed to have a hybrid of the two, so people can keep their vending machines on the outside.
---
Yh ok if u got the caps there might be a few kn r/falloutmarket if your willing to pay 10 I
---
Can't you cannot drop them lol.
---
Just to be safe I‚Äôm going to avoid any level 30s with a skull player icon for the next few weeks‚Äî I suggest you do the same.
---
Definitely will, thank you for the advice!
---
If they have to combine two separate updates to make it look bigger, it means both updates were relatively small by their own right.
---
I appreciate this information. I was kind of on the fence with this one, and I will look at one of the others.
---
I lost 3 explosive shotguns, a bloodied gat, and an AAE minigun, along with 5k 5mm, and 3k shells just yesterday. Was x-ferring between characters in my private world, and had a wierdly long load time. 
---
When I checked the suitcase, it was empty.
---
I'm not aware of any, but I haven't maxed both reps, so I was covering my bases.
---
The game is literally loaded with resources I have always felt. Like right now no one should be struggling with ammo.
---
You can find it everywhere 
---
It‚Äôs on mobs 
---
You can buy it  
---
You can buy it from other players 
---
You can convert it
---
You can buy an ammo maker from the raiders
---
You get it was rewards 
---
You can make it
---
You can farm it in ACP and DO
---
That‚Äôs 9 different sources for ammo that stacks
---
My biggest problem was trying to find ways to use my resources. Before player vending it was selling to NPC vendors. Now it‚Äôs other players. I sell more junk and food than plans, weapons or armor.
---
This is the first game where the in game economy works for me and let‚Äôs me be an actual merchant
---
OP, this üëÜ
---
seriously, thank you so much for listening. i love this game, but the difficulty level for my under 50 toon has been devastating. im definitely looking forward to the fixes. i dont want it to be too easy of course, but this is definitely a bit much.
---
What level are you? I just came back after a long break. I‚Äôm level 53 and everything murders me
---
THIS.
---
so, since console and peecee are separate universes, cough up $400+ for another entire xbx just to play BGS‚Äô Inventory Management Simulator 2020?
---
uhm.. no thanks?? ‚Äî Beth‚Äôs definitely **not** my favorite Aunt anymore üò°
---
It's going a bit ehhh if anything, im not doing too much damage but im doing enough i mostly two tap things but i use my weaker of my three revolvers most the time but yeah a gunslinger is more prominent on the pistol, single action is fun but slow reloads and weaker damage, .44 is good but feels (to me at least) like a basic weapon, western revolver is fast reload decent firing speed and enough damage to put down most common enemies in 2-3 shots but i should also add i have all my revolvers with explosive rounds so i do more damage than normal
---
I didn‚Äôt realize this can happen. Damn
---
&gt;Settler __Wanderer__ is missing
---
Oh no. Who would‚Äôve thought a person evidently known for their nomadic lifestyle would leave a random little settlement, one day, never to return?
---
Haha I‚Äôm an 18 man. But The levels scale so we can struggle together
---
It's a good photo in all honesty.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nice and clear, good angle.  It'd make a good background.
---
That never mattered before. I've made it back into the same PS, even after freezing, disconnected, and XB reset.
---
If the enemies ‚Äúscale‚Äù so should the rewards ...... but the rewards have remained the same crappy low they were before.  It takes more resources to play the game.  More resources need to be acquired.  This is the definition of balance issues .... it will be solved with increasing the MAX levels of weapons and armor ... I just wish they would have done that ALL at the same time.  It is not fun right now.  Nothing to attain of value for me, right now.
---
My friend I play with is 60 so not too different
---
It‚Äôs magic bc of the 33 vats hits chance so I‚Äôm vats it does insane damage, the 2shot has no magic effect so it doesn‚Äôt do as much damage it‚Äôs just a bug unless you have an armor piece that has reduce damage while blocking, it makes all shotguns no matter the perks do insane damage
---
Did you post this before or copy/paste someone else‚Äôs post?
---
I‚Äôll add you later when I get on, my gt is iiExtravagent
---
F76 isn't really a "new" game, either; it's two years old.  My old PC was five when F76 launched.
---
I played F76 on the old computer.  It ran everything just fine.  On mostly **high** settings, even!
---
My old GTX 970 was exactly the Recommended spec, my system RAM was 16GB (twice the rcommended 8GB), only the CPU was below minimum ... and not by a long way.  (UserBenchmark scores the Ryzen 5 1500X at 94, and the FX-8350 at 76 - only an 18 point difference.)
---
...
---
Of course, my *new* one (Core i7-10700K processor, RTX 2070S graphics, 32GB memory) blows it completely out of the water ... :D ... but hte old one was more than capable of running F76 at or near maximum settings.  (I was subscribing to F1st at the time, too, so most of the CPU-intensive stuff - e.g. dealing with tracking other players - never applied anyway).
---
Sweet
---
It's called a colossus problem and you gotta nuke a mine
---
Honestly I love the infiltrator perk it's so far the only one that has made a significant improvement for me while playing
---
I can help out some but I‚Äôm not on everyday
---
Can't you ? :/
---
Rare drop from Daily Ops.
---
Did it wih the wife in 7 minutes with a build back from release. Nothing a few plasma grenades can't handle. Got burrow signs as reward
---
That's not 100% safe either. Disconnects, or game freezes can still roll back inventory.
---
I forget the name of the mine
---
That‚Äôs brilliant - gonna try it next nuke I see.
---
Any mine in particular?
---
That‚Äôs fine just add me yo
---
Ok, and large when combined... what is your point? Also pushing back a couple months  allows them to add more content hypothetically.
---
aha! so I‚Äôm not imagining things! ty!! ü•≥
---
What‚Äôs your gt?
---
Monongah Mine.
---
Nope.
---
Posted above!!
---
Monongah Mine
---
I die if they cluster.... My secret service armour doesn't really protect lol
---
The regular train vendor bots (at least some one of them) sell the Handmade plan. I never got one to drop until I learned it.
---
\+33 vats hit chance is a 'magic' effect.
---
Yes.monongah
---
No problem, good luck in finding one :).
---
Thanks I think so too
---
Scrap it then re-build it.
---
She‚Äôs shackin up with me, tee hee hee!
---
Maybe scrap her and put in a new ally? Then put back in?
---
This whole Daily Ops business is the game in easy mode, I do them solo naked and use fists, have to otherwise there is no challenge.
---
Mr Gutsies give no fucks. They tanky bois.
---
I run sentinel armor as well but I'm seriously contemplating collecting a set of trouble shooter's armor solely for those robot encounters.
---
I don‚Äôt like the argument of the math changes as a foundation, because it‚Äôs unfinished and shouldn‚Äôt have gone live until it‚Äôs done.
---
It‚Äôs the same idea as burning down someone‚Äôs house, building a new frame for them, then saying you‚Äôll be back in the coming months to put the walls and roof on.  TBD on plumbing and electrical.  Get it all done now or stop playing with matches.
---
My characters are mostly fine with the changes, since I min/max and spent two years collecting gear, but several of my good buddies are in pretty rough shape.  I can‚Äôt help but feel frustrated for them.
---
I don't think I have that. I've seen them &amp; been meaning to plan them but I end up forgetting, lol.
---
You can move the camp a little and rebuild the base to build something different or somewhat similar without losing anything.
---
All the stuff will be put In stored fully fixed and placeable.
---
This happened to me awhile ago and it gave me a reason to rebuild with all the new items I gotten from atom shop and legendary run.
---
Yeah in another game i am playing (Guild wars 2), we had a great mod for loadouts, then company released their own official loadouts, which hard over-monetize, and they forced the guy who made the mod to disable his, so we don't have a choice.
---
I've...uhh...sullied the image...

Oh didn‚Äôt see it
---
[removed]
---
She owes me more weapon cases tho
---
Already tried it
---
This is the way. Need to scrap completely
---
I have a character who gets disconnected 10-20 minutes after logging in and is rolled back, but that has been going on for awhile. 
---
Don't bother contacting support, they'll just say it's your internet.
---
They have to pay Sony/MS for every update they push through the platforms. It's why the PTS, and hotfixes are on PC first.
---
It saves them money by combining updates.
---
You're pessimistic. That's appropriate. üëç
---
Already tried
---
Think I posted yesterday or couple days ago
---
They‚Äôre not too expensive and it‚Äôs my favorite of the commando weapons.
---
I can't believe we aren't running away screaming for the entire event.
---
My vampire ffr gatling gun is OP as fuck for my bloodied build.
---
Absolutely not! Because once Bethesda goes in and messes with that algorithm, the whole favorite system will break. And then we‚Äôll all be accidentally scraping and dropping our favorite legendary stuff. Leave it alone.
---
Scrap it. Log out. Log back in. Build it again. 
---
Once you have the ally item, they shouldn‚Äôt disappear completely from being available.
---
But it's everytime I try to get into a game. I even uninstalled the game and redownloaded it and I'm still having the same issue.
---
Alried tried it
---
His milk must be top tier
---
Deathclaw Gauntlet for unarmed
---
Congratulations on the Platinum, I'm still one short; guess I should go hunt down a wanted player.
---
I am getting tagged by teams of Griefers.
---
Cowardly fuckers.
---
I will have a bit of the occasional PvP,attack me and i will fight back usually killing you.
---
However i em encountering more and more Tag Teams,you kill the Griefer,and you are killed by their team mate hiding close by that you did not even engage in PvP with.
---
What i do now is make sure i am not carrying anything before engaging.
---
Imagine lying for no reason at all.
---
I think the two builds are too distinct to alternate.  If you want pa, that's fine, but use it 100% of the time, and same for regular armor.  What benefit do you gain from switching.
---
And the UI for it sucks.
---
This.
---
Hopefully she's out looking for some new sheet music.
---
Wait, does this mean I can solo Encryptid without getting brutalized?
---
there's only one way to settle this
---
FIIIIIGHT
---
Hopefully she comes back soon so I can hear it üò≥
---
They are worthless for combat too. What is the purpose of these things? Is it filler as a reward? I would rather have regular working grenades.. At least they are effective and can be sold.
---
Gutsys have armor pen. I'm a junkies build. Instead of full vanguards, I run four different specialties, including troublemakers. It cuts 15 percent even if it pens armor, I believe. Makes a big difference for me in any event.
---
I want the XP honestly so I was kinda bummed
---
I have gotten nothing 4 times in a row. I have 2 main characters and upon getting elder (first time) I get no rare drops. So I got drops only on day one. Is it the same for you?
---
trick question it was never hard
---
that trick has been around for a while. It's good if you're by yourself and nobody turns up. But if someone else is there then go HAM. So much loot and xp from those mobs!
---
So you ran it by not running bloodied. Are you even aware of yourself?
---
Nice. When I tested out a BFFR gatling gun (pre-patch 22) I was pleasantly surprised at being able to take out scorchbeasts in just a few shots. Amazing ammo efficiency.
---
The slowing robots this DO, suck hard.
---
I've never insta-died so many times in such a short period.
---
Yeah same, but also you have to think of the domino effect that has. I've noticed a few annoying things that has been happening since this patch. Since it takes longer to dispatch enemies, you'll be shot at more, so my armor has been breaking a lot more frequently (I put on that armor perk in agility to help remedy that). With getting shot at more, Dodgy started fucking me lol so I had to put an AP refresh armor peice, and action boy. I love that it's not so easy anymore, I love the more xp and higher level enemies, but it's made it a bit more grindy.
---
Wait, i just got back and am grinding for it, whats wrong with it...?
---
Good question, one of many I would like to know about the perk.
---
Is the second effect +33 Vats, +50 limp damage or +50 bash damage? Or wearing armor with -15 damage while blocking?
---
As long as they're on the objective, I'm happy.
---
It works phenomenally in say the Fissure Prime area since there's barely any enemies. Works crazy good at Whitespring too with less worrying about no fly spawning.
---
Didn‚Äôt work üòî
---
So it wasn't just ours? They were all packed, and I put it down to robots just being larger and dying slower so more had time to appear, but on one particular run there were no exaggeration at least 12 Gutsies instantly murdering us at Signal Beta. Needless to say we failed that run.
---
This was the end of my last run of the day: [https://imgur.com/a/oOadyG5](https://imgur.com/a/oOadyG5)
---
Five Gutsies in a small hallway. Terrifying. Inhumane.
---
I'm near Monongah mine, right above site Bravo. Nuke me as much as you want. I ain't moving.
---
Quick somene setup a greenhouse dome
---
"TWO MEN ENTER ,ONE MAN LEAVE!"
---
So was it because I was sitting there that the rest didn't spawn in?
---
Dont know ill check tmrw and write it here
---
Scrip and Sell to your daily limit.  Sell the high value stuff at a reduced price in your vendor. 
---
With everything else you can't get rid of put it in random boxes like the overseers cache as a surprise for a lucky traveler.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5DnqW3F57E
---
I agree. I‚Äôm sitting here with my bloody Gatling gun 2 to 3 shooting lvl 100 super mutants while a lvl 10 takes more time to kill their level adjusted ones.
---
just go to your camp placement and press A on it, it repairs all structures if you have the mats.
---
Short answer yes.   
---
I used to RP with a small group and had the drunken quack doctor support style build using but only addicted to alcohol. Cola nut with party boy drinking nuka dark was always great.
---
You should be. That said, power armor and a vampire weapon will keep you up generally, and a team of two or three with hopefully at least one of you a full-health build is pretty much a certain Elder ranking. Remember, you only have to kill a few enemies at the end and the boss. It's mostly hold and survive.
---
I certainly haven't heard of plans to implement this.  I can see how having to do a quest multiple times would be annoying, but you'd all get the same outcome.
---
The only ones that get me don't make the damn noise. And its always at the end of a dungeon or something so I have to needlessly run back 5 minutes.
---
Yeah that's the goal. I'll be happy if I make it lvl 50 or 75 before I take a break. I took a break right before wastelanders came out so I I'm gonna all in on it.
---
If you're sitting where I said then yeah, unless you hit one to get it's attention for some reason they don't move out of their starting spot.
---
Yup everything you buy with gold Bullion is bound to the player
---
I have maxed rep in both for at least last 3 months 
---
The floater grenades are bound because to make them you need to buy the recipe in gold
---
fyi, the -15 damage while blocking makes all shotguns 'magic'
---
except one time only rewards at the end of a long quest line. Those you can drop on a whim to never ever see again for the rest of your character's existence.
---
Because that makes full fucking sense.
---
Agreed
---
Everyone pre patch suffered during these levels.  It prolly sucks little bit more but keep grinding and upgrading your gear.  You'll be 50 soon and the real grind starts.
---
Today I had two Elder rankings where I got nothing. One I got a duplicate Brotherhood mask (my third) and another the Stash Box skin I'll never use. Feels bad given this one was more painful than the last few days.
---
Because I only have 2 Charisma and cant share
---
Read my mind, buddy! I'd eat eggo waffles in the morning and my grandma would watch reruns of this show. Was good times.
---
ACP after getting all the rewards you want, simply isn't worth the effort anymore, unless I suppose you need screws.
---
SBQ is much easier, faster, and everyone on the server gets to participate. Plus you get improved repair kits and she can be crippled again.  
---
Also a lot of people are focusing on S2 and Daily Ops right now like others have said.
---
Between them fucking over stealth, and providing no incentive to do them, complete shit.
---
Meanwhile, you can drop the end-of-a-whole-quest-line rewards for Mistress of Mystery without any  warning or pause or concern, to never ever be seen again by your character.
---
This game's design doc was written in the bottom of a finished cup of tea.
---
I love when people include the level as if it has any relevance. Assholes are assholes, doesn't matter if they're level 2, 200 or 2000.
---
idk, maybe it‚Äôs the oldskool DBA in me that has a different definition of ‚Äúrollback‚Äù than Zeni‚Äôs devs?
---
rollback used to mean ‚Äúrestore to previous known-good unharmful state‚Äù
---
not ‚Äúbaha thanks for your money and time investment, fo1st lusers; go fuck yourselves LOL! love always, Todd.‚Äù
---
I get the fun in BOFH, but c‚Äômon.
---
atomic is atomic.
---
*~sigh~*
---
I wish there was an automated bot response to this complaint.
---
Antiarmor Gutsies beat 50% of DR.  If you rely  solely on DR, they will tear you apart.  Perks like Dodgy, Lone Wanderer, Serendipity and Ricochet make them much easier to deal with.  Also, conventional armor doesn‚Äôt absorb 42% of the damage outright like any suit of power armor does.  Stack it all together and they have a much harder time killing you.
---
My next favourite part about this post after your attitude is the fact you're replying to your post instead of the comments.
---
Just play the game and earn them there's plenty around for free.
---
Hunters shack spawns 2 ticks and the fissure site near the pumpkin house spawns 2-3. Or you can just kill raiders and blood eagles to get stimpaks
---
Yup, the best part of being a melee build is the explosive instant gratification from a classic smack on the hood
---
Clearly your not fully taking advantage of the perks your given legendary or not. That‚Äôs all that needs to be said.
---
How does this work ?whenever i shoot someones wall, it looses some heath but never goes zero and within seconds it goes back to full lol
---
The plans are what I'm aiming for on my main as a new backup weapon. Not had it yet, but I'm consoling myself I can try every day for it. In the same way, don't worry too much, these are daily quests with no new ones coming til after Christmas. You'll have duplicate everythings by the time we have been Ops.
---
For real! Qnd I just dont understand teams that forn to do ops and just.....don't. Even after the bond is up
---
Im afraid if I try to answer this, I'll wake up on a beach 4 dreams deep.
---
In NW?
---
Bloodied unarmed is working perfectly, except against Earl and Queenie. Just clear enemies in those scenarios or get a magic minigun. It sucks going from first to worst, but we‚Äôll manage.
---
True, being a solo player game that makes sense, you‚Äôre also handed a full suit of power armor pretty quickly in f04,
---
Imagine if it took no effort in 76 to piece together a suit or go find that one weapon you‚Äôve been scouring the world for. It‚Äôs take out so much effort involved and make the game way to easy imo
---
Use Foundations, sunk way into the ground.  At least then, you don't have semi-floating floors all over.
---
Its +50 limb damage
---
      Quadruple ammo capacity 
---
      +1 perception
---
In regards to my build thats completely fair. I have to learn to adapt but having daily ops anti sbeak so far sucks. 
---
Luckily I just joined a random team and we went elder on the ops, first try, so thats nice. I just dont understabd teans who form for events or daily ops and do do them.
---
&gt;His
---
Err...
---
Oh absolutely. I had no idea this bastard was even there. I was basically just playing with firecrackers when I nailed him.
---
I got valley signs and whisper in the dark
---
Thats fair. And I didnt mean to get so worked up its just annoying sometimes
---
Nope, just in the regular mode
---
aye. i usually stand on the roof looking at bridge hub. BUT these days someone always turns up cos of the mobs
---
Don't entirely blame Bethesda for the poor turnaround, blame consoles.  Unless the game literally breaks or there's a super serious exploit it's not worth rushing hotfixes through console cert.
---
I‚Äôm getting lots of lag when I open my stash, or go into vendors...wasn‚Äôt like this before the update.
---
We so don't give a damn about these nades üòÇ
---
It also does it if you decide to join or leave a public team while in an op.
---
I have my perks set up that i need to be on a team with someone else at all times and in the middle of an op everyone else left my team (they weren't in the op, they just were done playing) and so i joined another team and booooot out of the op i go.
---
Im trying to get a stack of legendary items for my "days off". So I can still get my 150 legendary notes within 5min
---
No that's completely fair point on my build. Im aware its my fault and I'm trying to adapt but it sometimes sucks to not sneak at all in the ops.
---
Just take away grenades alltogether
---
No.....?
---
I would like to plant them around too!
---
And now, I've got two men ‚Äî two men with a gut full of fear. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, dying time's here!
---
Feels to me like a ton of Perks are no longer working properly since this Patch.
---
Stealth you might as well have a flashing blue light on your Head.
---
Yes they do.
---
As far as I know, the only "portable" structures are the prefab ones like the RR garage, communist bunker, etc. You have to remove the doors/curtains before add it as blueprint and then you'll be able to place it almost anywhere. üòäüëçüèª
---
I run a full health PA/HG build with a Vamp .50 cal and haven't noticed much of a difference, my ammo expenditure is slightly higher but more than offset by Ammo Factory Legendary Perk.
---
amen to this. but id say it should dgm increase 50,75,100,125 and 150all enemies, including little bugs take like 20 bullets lolhow an ant, roach or a tick dont die with 1 bullet ??
---
60% boost with 9 perks is already absurdly low.
---
I had a similar thing happen. 
---
Someone kept trying to engage me in combat while I was working on my CAMP. It got annoying, so I locked them in a building (I swapped a door for a wall). Ensue rampage, carnage, and the destruction of my base. 
---
I fixed everything while they spammed the heart emote at me.
---
Definitely turned on Pacifist afterwards.
---
The War Glaive can't.
---
Which is fuuuucking terrrrribbbble
---
Bloodied builds didn't even get nerfed, if anything they are even more viable and are still the easiest way to play. Its unbearable to play any of my toons but bloody now.
---
The term bloodied build is commonly used to describe a low health perk build. Using a bloodied weapon is a completely different thing. I never once said i ran with bloodied weapon, nor did OP. Welcome to the game.
---
Do you only need to have one radio functional in order to win the event?
---
.....are you kidding me. I did that whole questline without knowing about this. I think I may have leveled up or something when that dialogue came up. If I cant see the subtitles I miss the dialogue.
---
I facepalmed when everyone universally panned the first iteration of legendary perks, then they added Infiltrator and instantly everyone seemed happy.
---
Let them eat cake.
---
They said they look to mods for content ideas, IE: the upcoming perk loadouts
---
I actually didn‚Äôt even know that was a plan. Thank you for that.
---
Rollback just means to revert to a previous version. There is the implicit meaning that the previous version functioned which is where you get "good unharmful state".
---
But if one person drops items which triggers a save and the game saves their status. Then the person who picks it up gets rolled back by quitting before a save is triggered, the items no longer exist.
---
From what I understand is they are trying to make situations in daily ops that are easy for 1 play style but hard for another. Resilient is obviously set up for melee builds and they are currently working on one for stealth builds.
---
It has a gas mask stupid
---
Or Bush Wookie for 10 mins.
---
Lol I saw someone‚Äôs ally running past charleston station today.
---
I blame most of the issues on my 99cent value meal internet (and the fires) but last night friends and I, all from different areas, noticed we got that server not responding notice at the same time.
---
Also neither event was worth it loot wise before, and with one wasteland they are waaaayyy not worth it. Coupled with daily ops that vomit legendary weopons more quickly there just isn't a point.
---
So, each enemy type has certain levels it can spawn. You're right, brahmins don't spawn at lv100, but they have the same values at lv50 as other enemy types, that can spawn at lv100. To make sure the list is not scattered with holes, I made it like that. So yeah, if there were lv100 brahmins, they would drop that kind of XP.
---
Yes, just for you. I'll pass this on to the team.
---
Was it her?
---
I've had it on defend / retake workshop events.
---
That said - I normally see it as a plus - as there attacks just sit in limbo and I can collect my power cores.

Throwing knives were pretty powerful around low lvl. I used to make a ton of them and throw them.
---
You should use perks that increase your damage like bloody mess and weapon damage perks. 
---
Get concentrated fire and aim for the head with vats. It will help a lot on saving ammo and killing stuff faster.
---
My only advice would be go to west tek and snipe all the super mutants out front, log out log back in, and do it again until level 50.
---
Is this real?
---
Shh...let's see how this plays out.
---
if youre a stealth build, you should also use Escape Artist. Guaranteed ability to go from \[Danger\] to \[Caution\].
---
If you want to play a hardcore game, play souls.
---
*  There was maybe a few hundred or so,
---
I just walked through the OP without much problem in my underpants  killing them all. did it in 2 minutes 16 seconds
---
* Thought i would  spew this line this out first.All lies of course :-)
---
Sounds like you want to do that.
---
I've only ever had that happen once to my CAMP, Played the Titanic song through the mic before it hit ahah
---
Lol I don‚Äôt think so it was sophia daguerre decked out in the full spacesuit.  Nobody else was around.  I stopped to talk to her to see if she‚Äôd stop running but as soon as her initial dialogue was up, she took off in a sprint again.  I‚Äôve been seeing/hearing some weird stuff around the wasteland.  Ward keeps saying some really odd stuff to me when I collect his daily.
---
Well even if you have the wanderer,punk and forager at your base you can still encounter another version out in the wastes.So I am pretty sure those are time traveling 3rd generation synths.Hmm that sounds vaguely familiar....
---
nah  
---
it was worse than the Super Mutant Ops two days ago. Robots and Freeze is a horrible combo. barely made it in Elder Rank
---
3 chances a day, one for each tier you unlock. 5%, 10%, 80%.
---
I just want shit to be like at release

Just close your eyes and swallow..... It's for Suvival xD
---
PC tho
---
I totally agree
---
They have 2 heads, they might have 2 sets of other things. I mean none of us have seen a two-headed bull, right?
---
Yesterday I had three no drops from three toons before finally getting one on my fourth.
---
So if I were to do another run of the Daily Ops then I wouldn't be able to get a rare reward if I already got one earlier?
---
[deleted]
---
Don‚Äôt trade expensive stuff like legacy or bloodied fixers or what not. Your bound to run into someone who will just take it and leave.
---
No, learn to use real weapons. So when they actually finally get rid of magic effects your not still a trash can.
---
I understand that and that would be nice.   
---
But what I did is not completely respecing my character for the test. I could have done it with a base intelligence of 15 without the unyielding set, but since I had to kill a lot of high level enemies for that test, I tried to do it as best I could with my standard armor set.  
---
Basically what you can do is test the amount of XP you get from one of those enemy types at a certain level, no matter the buffs or specs or perks and then you'll see how much each enemy give you personally.  
---
Like I wrote, your values will always be different, the sheet is for seeing, which enemy types are similar and worth farming. The values itself are fairly useless.
---
And if they ever fix it that will be a sad day
---
Let them know I want a fully functioning Giddyup Buttercup toy too please.
---
They should be removed from the game . they're kinda useless
---
Fix one bug and 3 more will take its place! -2020 gaming
---
I gotchu! Anything else fellas?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm coming back from a 3 month break
---
Ive gotten all the new things from Earle. Im very well stocked on screws too. Earle is resource intensive.It costs me a considerable amount of ammo, more than what Im getting out of it in the end, specially now with the changes. Trashed armor and weapons also add to the cost and a limited window to loot while still dealing with wendigos. Id honestly much rather repeat the daily ops a few times. Im still doing SBQ whenever it comes up though. I dont find her as much of a slog so I get my flux and repair kits from there
---
Fast travel or sleep immediately after anything important. That initiates a save and sync, and prevents a ‚Äúroll back‚Äù which is really just a loss of data since last save.
---
Thank you so much for clarifying!
---
I'm interested if they are pre-built locations to build in or like purgatory an we literally build everything. I'd rather honestly have more normal camp budget because I like making camps look like I'm game locations.
---
But honestly anything is a improvement to the camp im all for it...
---
I had same prob . Made a post about it few days ago. Guy told me try shooting in bursts. There‚Äôs a delay. Might help. I‚Äôve noticed it a lil less since.
---
Someone was complaining this morning on chat that they couldn't put it in their vendor, so it might not be.
---
I know some of the other plans are though, because i got the cage lights in a camp vendor this morning.
---
Yeah, and the stealth camo is easy for teslas/explosives. Uplink in general is there for the PA boom boom bang builds, their next mission type is supposed to be stealth oriented
---
Yup. Somewhere some Kevin has taken a picture of his monitor showing this thread, emailed it to his computer, and then printed it out to frame it.
---
I wish this question could only be asked once a day
---
Radrats were a pita before the patch too.  Hated them then, hatem now.  They bite hard and take a lot of hits.  However, last weekend I cleared all of Fort Defiance with a 45 sneaky sniper - mostly one shotted everything with non-legendary fully modded lever rifle and hunting rifle and shadow leather and stealth3.  If I broke stealth then my dmg sucked and I got spanked.  Died after being mobbed once.  Snapping vats and shooting quick worked well. Still don‚Äôt have the third rifleman card in either.
---
If Beth is doing something on the servers, this can happen. They close empty servers immediately when doing hot fixes. This can cause you to get a fresh private every time you log out.
---
Why rush to kill Earle when you can farm those freaky bastards?
---
Also, for those that don't know, there's no consequence to staying in the cave after he dies and farming until it collapses. You spawn outside with all your loot and get the rewards.
---
Ceiling fans please
---
Um no, you can pick your SPECIAL point and then switch to a different special to pick the card. On xbox it is LB and RB, just look at the controls on the bottom of the screen
---
hardcore gamers are so obnoxious. dont even worry about people who think ‚Äúyou dont let your character build in a video game dictate how much you love yourself‚Äù is an insult. youre allowee to enjoy different things.
---
I really need them so I can give my rabbits a proper pumpkin patch.
---
Gotta admit the perk lives up to its name and beyond!  Pure legend stuff from Bethesda indeed.
---
Terrible photographic Faux pas on your part.
---
Earl has red Eye.
---
Great picture though :-)
---
This ones got the right idea!!  Knows the risks, welcomes it.
---
Oh that would actually be pretty cool... Okay what else? And no, we will not be adding Mothman body pillows. Stop asking.
---
Those cards were always additive with each other, not multiplicative, so it was always only 60%. Not saying it shouldn't be looked at, but that isn't the reason peoples damage changed.
---
Oh, a server? What‚Äôs your platform?
---
That lumber yard at the beginning of the game near the vault. Can't remember what it's called.
---
&gt; They don't want a level 5 player with max lockpick.
---
Master infiltrator invalidates that :D I know it's only on alt characters when you have a 50+, but that perk shows us that a lower level being able to get more pre-war money and pocket watches really doesnt break anything
---
I think so, but usually if I cut them all off at the bridge they can't read the others
---
If you want Berserker tied to something, why not Luck?
---
Nocturnal I would possibly make do regular damage during the day and maybe up to a 30% increase in damage at night.
---
actually, the problem is using 5 stimpaks, 200 bullets, and breaking two pieces of armor in one battle with 4-5 mobs. probably dying once too. maybe listen to what people are actually saying instead of projecting your experience onto everyone else and then telling them to quit whining.
---
Lol, cowboy builds! Dual single action would be awesome. I can see it now...
---
Yes, another life support event where a cosmetic is locked behind 30k overseer points
---
You get the same chance to earn 2 rewards if you only get elder rank.
---
I know! That's the one ray of hope I have for them, it got pushed back into 2021 somehjow though which doesn't make sense, why not just approach the modder, or even examine the mod and achieve it in a different way?
---
Ots a perk card bug which allows this best to switch servers and repair its happened alot recently it's just trolls being trolls unfortunately
---
If you‚Äôve unlocked the 3 tiers, then no. That‚Äôs it for the day.
---
Wow, the lego bit is a good curse. I can almost feel it now, as a father of two who were terrible with their legos. üòÇüòÇ
---
Their bonus only multiplies base weapon damage, it doesn't stack multiplicatively with any other damage bonuses. This was somewhat the case already, effects like two shot did this, but now it's standardized across the board
---
Holy shit. I just learned something!
---
Thank you!
---
I enjoyed it. Yes it was extremely hard at first but immensely satisfying when we got Elder.
---
lol even silly animals like frogs are bullet sponges and if i get attacked by 4+ and not careful, they can stacks hits and take my hp to 20% ish. I have full SS armor with buttrest and extra dr and poison resist lol 
---
defending a workshop at mire for ex is NOT worth at all...
---
You ever get an answer for this? Because I have the exact same issue, I've started multiple times including trying in a private server and in a regular.  There also were no fake walls but the activate option was there so I had to slowly walk through the cave. But now I'm stuck not able to continue.
---
How about a Rose body pillow?
---
Yep, magic.
---
What happened with white knight?
---
Especially when they keep adding more and more shit, and people keep finding more and more stash/budget/duping exploits...already love having all my damage delayed by two seconds because some fuckwit cant level up properly, I'd love  to see how that works when I have 12 more flying mansions on that server
---
I wish the menu would give accurate feedback on when the team started the op and how long it has been running for. I loaded into the game and joined a ops team yesterday. Saw they were in ops so I joined only for it to be literally finishing which made me look a bit like a leech since I got the end of event drop. id like to know first hand if I can be of help or not
---
May he run in to that lvl 500 dude with too much time and a vendetta against people like him.
---
When I was a kid, I fell off the top bunk of a bunk bed onto a hardwood floor covered in legos. It felt as good as you‚Äôd imagine.
---
Are you sure you want to drop them?
---
No absolutely no- 
---
*Well actually...*
---
I want her to come visit more often!
---
Perhaps a means of giving her a stall to stick around.
---
It's one point per remove, so I don't get your two  points when I need ammo? It's free to put a card back. With the scoreboard challenge you are basically required to make a level a day, meaning 2 points per day, unless you craft bullets daily you will have a cumulative of loosepoints you can use for that
---
Instead of getting 180 ultracite .308 I get 452 and that is without Super Duper in action.
---
What makes it magic? I thought magic weapons are the hacked ones
---
They're renting low-quality servers from amazon iirc. The only improvement they can make is spending more money on servers that are actually intended for a game of this scale
---
I always goo myself and get stuck in limbo
---
Yes, it involved completely restarting the mission over if I recall correctly.
---
Been there,done that.
---
Also in full unyielding.
---
Shredded.
---
Makes me wonder what the point is in all this Tier 1 SS  Unyielding [Armour.In](https://Armour.In) my opinion the result of coming in to contact with any Gutsie, or the Death ray of an Assaultron Head at Level 50,or level 400 is always the [same.Death.One](https://same.Death.One) shot from a Gutsy takes like a third of your [Health.So](https://Health.So) when 3,4,are surrounding you giving you quick bursts it is impossible to Stim Pack fast [enough.So](https://enough.So) you die.
---
Only done the event once Solo.Sure i finished it and killed the Boss. Took me like 35 minutes though.
---
Hated the Burrows that much have not done another OP since.
---
Oh ok I get what you‚Äôre saying now.  Nice!
---
that sucks.  I doubt they are hotfixing on a Saturday night.  Idk.  I use Sutton station.  4 mailbox things around.
---
Why do people get so butthurt over their camp being destroyed? It can all be fixed with one button. You'll be fine.
---
this makes some sort of reasonable sense. shitty practice imo, but makes some sort of sense.
---
we used to have what ... about a six-minute window? 
---
to solo flip-flop a private world instance.
---
for vanishing to be consistently immediate, they must be hotfixing their farms like the dickens then üòê
---
wonder how long it‚Äôll last.  (stay tuned; will update over the weekend)
---
I‚Äôm going to suggest that the people complaining it was too easy and the people complaining it is too hard now might possibly be different people.
---
Yeah, so I was kinda hoping to generate a discussion. I apologize if it was executed poorly. I follow fallout news semi-closely and I hear on YT videos people say things like ‚Äòwe know a lot about instances interiors‚Äô - and I‚Äôm like, I don‚Äôt know anything aside from that it‚Äôs happening. 
---
Exactly, where does this leave our pre-fabed houses we have now? 
---
I have to imagine these instanced interiors will be accessible through a specific door. That door probably isn‚Äôt available to us yet - which means current structures should be okay?
---
Coz it‚Äôs a clear abuse of bugs and exploits
---
All 'magic' effects trigger a hidden Furious effect that ramps up damage, but only in Vats for shotguns.
---
In the end it's all a matter of your type of play, I use more ammo than I get from the Ops/Colossus so I can't rely on that all. I craft ammo on a weekly basis because of the way I play, having it isn't that bad, I go from crafting 180 ultracite .308 to 452, can't complain.
---
Nope. Some maybe but the people in the group I am, I see the same names complain ‚ÄúI one shot everything it‚Äôs easy‚Äù to now ‚Äúit‚Äôs too hard, fuck this game‚Äù
---
I guess you wont be fine, oh well.
---
‚ÄúWhy are people upset when something unjust happens to them?‚Äù what an obnoxious comment.
---
just reading through this stuff, 3rd day here of no rare rewards for getting elder... my luck sucks at this rate ill need multiple characters to get stuff oh and prior 2 days i only got the jumpsuit plan each run.
---
I like turning enemies into green goo for extra nuclear material. But ever since radiation rumble nuclear material is everywhere.
---
It never messed with normal enemy respawn for me so idk about your claim about that one.
---
Wow - I am gonna follow this path next time of I log on! Thanks a ton!
---
So is that a exploit or something thats gonna get patched or was it always in the game
---
Perhaps it has something to do with server lag and actions not registering? I notice the same thing‚Äîsometimes it‚Äôs fine, other times it‚Äôs very pronounced.
---
just don't do anything but collect goodies
---
Agreed - it would be cool if you could add it to the walls I laid down. I‚Äôm fine if I‚Äôm confined to that space, as along as it means I can interlock objects and decorate the hell out of a place
---
Man I got the full set (both drops) yesterday. 
---
It has to be one of the coolest outfits I had ever seen after the NCR ranger, but I was pissed to see the exposed skin...
---
It looks awesome with the black shovel backpack too!
---
Jeez, you wont be fine either. Shame.
---
No I‚Äôm fine and I can hold myself In a fight, it‚Äôs just annoying that dumbasses like you presumably seem to think that exploiting bugs is fine and dandy
---
the effects in the pic i added are the so called magic effects on weapons or armor basically have any of these on a weapon or armor and shoot the same spot and the damage per hit is vastly higher then non 'magic' weapons[magic effects ](https://ibb.co/RP2Zq8K)
---
Yeah, I feel like if I have to invest in the bullet sponges, at least the reward so be something more than a portion of roach meat.
---
Nuclear Winter is cool (on consoles) there's no point to stop updating it. But with all the issues in PC, i wouldn't be suprised that the Bethesda's team is reevaluating its priorities on this gamemode.
---
[Edit:] I really would like to see more maps, more divercity, but the PC community is raging right now ! Bethesda needs to do something, they can't put their head under the sand and keep doing like everything's going right.
---
Crying about other players destroying your base in a pvpve game
---
LMAO
---
I did. I come back to read the subreddit every now and again hoping Bethesda had changed for the better. Every time I'm validated in my decision to shelve the game, despite how much I really enjoy the Fallout universe.   
---
It's been great for my mental health, lol.
---
My base wasn‚Äôt destroyed, just saying how dumb your comment was. Shame.
---
Mr.gutsy (the two shot burst variant) was always op it's the reason i always dodged the Awol event and the only way to deal with them is to get around corners and attack them one by one thank the dumb ai for this but with the freezing bs slowing your already slow swing and slowing your stimpack animation, it not feasible, also it need testing but from just how it feels i can tell that PA with 454 DR (i use a t51) absorb damage better than a secret service unyielding set (not maxed out yet) with 570 DR i don't know if it's intentional or a bug but it's getting annoying
---
To the person that destroyed my feelings when I was in second grade.
---
I still love you.
---
I was flummoxed by this topic until I remembered that there were jokes in the perk packs. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve read one in two years
---
Never said your base was destroyed. Just said you wont be fine either. Shame.
---
I never even thought I‚Äôm about pre-built interiors we could decorate...ü§Ø - lol 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt like that. I want to build the space myself
---
Why is your build so bad? I'm a bog standard rifleman and I don't have that problem. Irrational Fear so far is the only event solo I've had anything like that  problem.  And only then because those bee swarms get you and yao gauis are just tanks and when you have 2 of them they can stun lock you.
---
On top of this joining several daily ops group I am the weakest one in them and I only use about half my clip to kill most mobs.  And my Gauss rifle is 2 to 3 shots to kill anything short of a scorchbeast. My weapons have ghoul slayer and scorch slayer respectively.  My armor is all boosts your def at full health and at low heath.
---
Plasma flamer pistol! Effing brilliant, I need to try that.
---
A youtuber blew up by making videos on them a few months after they became public, basically a bunch of effects that somehow are bugged to apply the fo4 furious effect on top of whatever their other effect is. So with a very high fire rate weapon, you can have this damage overflow into instakilling the SBQ or colossus. So because that's the word he used for it, this place sounds like a kindergarten with everything being magic
---
I have lone Wanderer, Serendipity,full set of unyielding,
---
Honestly i have never noticed any difference.Shots just go through you like a knife through Butter.They did when i was level 50 in shit Armour,and they still do now in Tier 1 SS armour.
---
I think the only proven method to reducing the insane damage Gutsies do, is grinding out a full set of Troubleshooters.Some players keep a set for Nuke runs.
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôve got a shoot tonne of plans
---
the legendary perk "Taking one for the team" allows you to auto-trigger PVP against someone  when you use it and they shoot you if you are on a team from what i have heard. if you have it on take it off until they fix it
---
A Colossal Problem
---
Oh no, you hurt me. I dont do this. But it is the wasteland, there are no rules.
---
Makes sense. Ill keep that in mind. Thanks for the advice
---
Bloodied unarmed took a least a 70% damage reduction.  It was insane before but so was bloodied commando which didn't experience near the reduction. Melees role used to be boss killer which they can no longer do after patch 22. 
---
All other melee builds could easily be out damaged by a similarly specced heavy gunner or commando before patch 22. Now they are even less effective comparatively.
---
It's a farming build now with no advantages over ranged builds.
---
But they haven't been updating it. That's my point.
---
Apart from the ones Bethesda set...(:
---
Yeah unless you are with a full team and speced for damage resistance and evasion, you are better off throwing on a set of PA. My op build is excavator armor with an auto stim mod and a gauss minigun. Lets me solo the op if my team is being lame.
---
I ran I explosive heavy build for a while not too long ago.I had a instigating fatman and missile launcher as well as a furious auto grenade launcher and ap m79 launcher.None of them were very good when all perked out.They have been nerfed too much and just recently they nerfed the auto grenade launcher again.It seems that demo expert is only really useful for legendary explosive effect min maxing and maybe mines.
---
Not foƒ∫lowing. Did you get the reward for playing 7600 hours?
---
They do a great of enforcing them too, lol
---
When those Wendigos Nudge me when i am firing at the Collosus.
---
I get that enraged would love to beat them to a Pulp with 20lb of Steel.
---
Why use a melee weapon when I could use a rifle that does a bit less damage per hit but more dps?
---
I already have 2 suits now : \\
---
I just left the server man good luck getting in 
---
He‚Äôs still got plenty of stuff
---
Exactly,  without being to out dps ranged there is nothing but style points
---
because im level 30? also ‚Äúmake a better build‚Äù is a complete shit argument. sorry. not everybody likes to have the same optimized boring build that everyone else has. this is an rpg. if youve played any other fallout games, youll know that youve never been required to make the perfect build. i like to role play. the build im making isnt even ridiculous, its a strength/melee/pa build. im doing commando right now because i dont have access to most heavy guns and their perks. *because im level 30.* im so happy for you that youre enjoying yourself goth boy but not everyone has the same play style as you.
---
Not if it is set on military time. :-)
---
Thus
---
They were already complaining 3 days ago :/
---
I always assume bad parenting and/or small pp.
---
They shouldn‚Äôt have too when spineless runts wiggle through the cracks
---
Bloodied was nerfed but my BE 50 cal still mows enemies down. You can notice a difference easily, but its not too much of a dropoff.
---
Occasionally it will randomly spawn simultaneously with the Queen when  Fissure is Nuked.
---
Bug is still there,it happened the other day.
---
Man, who hurt you? Oh thats right, the guy who destroyed your base, haha.
---
Vanguards build with matching armor if you can pull it off. Shotguns with the 33 secondary perk.  
---
Junkies, two shot, anti-armor heavy gunner.  
---
Vampires or anti-armor or junkies rifleman or commando.  
---
Power armor is also a good choice if you aren't worried about stealth.
---
Change your skin to black while you wait for a fix.
---
I am so tired of the fact I cannot log in earlier on a day and sell crap.  Have a set time each day it resets, so I can clear my toon before I play to gather more shit.  A weekly cap would be ok too, but I hate playing after work through the week and get off early one day to find that I cannot clear my legendaries or inventory until hours later.
---
IT IS A HORRIBLE SYSTEM!
---
It‚Äôs called a ‚Äúweak feral ghoul‚Äù for a reason ffs. If all enemies are the same level regardless of type, the whole world just becomes one homogenous combat zone. There‚Äôs no difference. Why is a bloated glowing one at white springs the same level as a weak feral? 
---
You have a right to your own opinion, but as for ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù it‚Äôs because whitesprings is supposed to be MORE dangerous than flatwoods.
---
I just launch them in the air as wasteland fireworks.. they explode before they hit the ground if you throw straight up
---
I found if I wait until someone starts a public team for Daily Ops then i join that, usually get one more and we all jump into the daily op.
---
Any updates on this?  Confirmed?
---
I've gotten the sbq 3 times.
---
Oh i deleted my last comment, i didn't read you properly. Yeah i know, but the thing is that they need more than simple ban waves. We are talking of hacking issues. There's no major known breaking game bugs in Nuclear Winter. I mean there's nothing to really "update". If this is what you mean, i'm to sure what you mean my man lol.
---
Gameplay updates or bugs and anti-hacks updates ?
---
Do you unlock anything beside the plat trophy
---
Yes! He killed my pet deer. Getting al lethargic shit together cost me time, I don‚Äôt care about resources I have plenty. But my home shouldn‚Äôt be reduced to flying wood and a array of explosions coz some idiot found it funny to abuse bugs. And I don‚Äôt know why your defending this cunt
---
The hunting rifle and lever action are no longer very viable unless you're running a low health build. An instigating gauss rifle can still one-shot most things so if you want to be a sniper I'd make that your goal. In the meantime, you're stuck with multiple shot kills, so a fixer, combat rifle, radium rifle or handmade is going to be your best bet. I wish there were a middle ground weapon with the damage of a lever but a rate of fire and recoil that doesn't completely suck, it would be a lot of fun. If it were up to me I think I'd buff the radium rifle to make it fit the bill.
---
I have a pistols/shotguns character and for dps I use a quad double barrel. If you can't find one, an anti-armor or junkies faster fire rate combat shotgun will do.
---
My stealth sniper is a heavy weapons hybrid, and probably my most viable character. I use final word which is a guaranteed drop from Beckett's questline. The dps is considerably higher than a shotgun, but it uses a lot of ammo, so it's nice to have the gauss for ammo-efficient kills. Here's my [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=dd33e55&amp;d=pp2ic4lt2i12s12eh2ip2sq2s32sr1sb2s01pd2pk2pl2p60an2ao0cu2xm3x41x82l71ar2xp1ls2&amp;w=s72&amp;m=f3&amp;n=Heavy%20Rifleman) as it currently is. I'd say Follow Through is a waste unless you're a stealth commando, it's useless against trash mobs because it takes too long to take effect. During boss fights you're more likely to draw aggro than drop back into stealth so Taking One for the Team is a better option.
---
I haven't tried making a new character since One Wasteland by I've been playing with my level 33 nephew. He seems to be fine running around through the forest in excavator PA with a handmade, gatling gun and combat knife, but I keep having to drop him ammo so maybe Bethesda needs to scale things back a bit during the leveling up process.
---
wtf is an overseer ticket?
---
I can see your point. I don't agree with all of the changes, but I'm low-key hoping for a No Man's Sky-esque come back for 76. I'm sure it will get better. I'm hoping for sooner, rather than later.
---
I mostly want new maps. But I also want more nuclear winter exclusive items that you have to earn xp for.
---
People use exploits all the time, its not his fault Bethesda cant properly build their game. Your problem is with them, not with him.
---
Good idea üëç
---
What's does your SPECIAL stat spread look like? Also, any legendary perks you would recommend?
---
I have a STR melee build, but coming back to the game was interesting to say the least.
---
Yeah I started playing ESO recently because my friends were disappointed by F76. And I absolutely love this feature.
---
Still loot there?
---
It's the currency you get in nuclear winter by completing lifetime challenges or leveling up. You use it to unlock all the perks in nuclear winter. But once you do unlock all the perks, they're kinda worthless!
---
Side note- everyone your in the op with is on your team and can loot the enemies you kill. Only reason to let them get hits in is xp, so if someone pops a lunchbox I'll let others get hits otherwise I kill what I can and expect my teammates to do the same
---
But beside that, it's a good question ! It would be nice to have some info from devs in that regard. Where are we going with this, why no major update !?  üëç
---
Compared to bloodied how good is junkies? Is it more in line with bloodied after the nerf or is bloodied still superior?
---
No, it doesn't.  You still have to have a decent build and ISS will still kill you if you aren't careful.
---
Does anyone else want the vault suit to have an optional fully zipped up version? I hate the way it looks but want to keep playing as a Vault Dweller...
---
It dosen't give you more energy resistance, it makes energy attacks heal you.
---
They can spawn an infinite amount
---
I'd take a legendary wrench before I'd take a single one of those dumbass grenades
---
My problem is that it seems that you think he did this accidentally, like he was feeling cute and might destroy a house. You don‚Äôt accidentally level a building.
---
Looks good with ss helmet or blackened combat helmet plus gas mask. you can add a prisoner collar to both options. Also you could turn your character to black for a while.
---
So what? It's not like they killing themself or easier to kill by player
---
Bloodied laser rifle, battering BOS combat armor/ power armor
---
Thanks üëç
---
Wait... I thought the whole point of one wasteland was to make enemies more fair to fight for lower level players who don't want to fight higher level enemies left behind by higher level players? This didn't happen?
---
Bloodied is still the highest dps, but junkies isn't far behind
---
Heavy gunner, in or out of PA.   
---
Now if you are using magic legacy or the newly found glitched guns (aside from the glitched NW)  more options open up to viability. My alt is a gunslinger and I have a "The Troubleshooter" and hot damn if that gun is just not broken like no other.   
---
Note I am not talking hacked guns but there is a variety of glitches that allow for some absurd basic weapons that not NW related. The main glitch can be done by accident by anyone with a camp.
---
Bloodied is still slightly superior however, you can be at full health with a full vanguards sent cav set.
---
Actually I believe either player can have the perk. All other conditions have to be met. On a team, pasifist off.
---
You was so Lucky ü§£üëç
---
Agree with you buddy
---
Are they gonna fix this issue or was it intentional?
---
they are very easy to kill and give ammo. You could farm them all day long. I use 1-2 2mm per enemy and get 8+ back.
---
The issue with outsourcing work has always been this: at some point, would the value of the free/cheap labor that you gave your work to outweigh the own value you bring? 
---
When that happens, you have created your own replacement. 
---
I dont think Bethesda management or its rank and file employees wants people in the community working for free as part of its crutch. I do think however, that if a talented programmer modder applied for a Beth opening, they might get a job.
---
I have 4 characters...
---
[Edit:] And Fallout1st...
---
Really small pp
---
I feel the same way lol my SS armor is trash. It has to be bugged or something I feel like I'm easier to kill with it on
---
I take it your base has never been nuked because the guy dropping the bomb didn't know anyone's base was there...?
---
I never said he did it accidentally, he most likely did  clearly on purpose. But that's not his fault for that kind of exploit being in the game. He is just a PVPer doing PVP, exploit or no exploit. Again, your issue is with Bethesda. It's their fault those kinds of things happen.
---
Well, since lower level players are suffering more that may not be a bad thing.
---
What's your SPECIAL stat spread for the build? Any legendary perks you would recommend?
---
Yeah. I got used to the missing first shot. and now it's really bad. I do find it better if you go in and out and in to vats and then fire.
---
Elianora from the nodding community did end up working for Beth for a while so it happens
---
I‚Äôd be mad at you for that but you‚Äôre right
---
Unless you're going for magic shotguns, you are better off with a quad double barrel than a junkies combat shotgun. I haven't used junkies but my guess is it's roughly on par with anti-armor, and the quad double barrel out-damages it due to crazy rate of fire.
---
Dead sub is dead
---
Just put on all damage boosting effects and find out.
---
Thx I‚Äôll try it, I‚Äôm not bad at fps games but I kinda always liked using vats even in its worse implementation in F76.
---
I have dropped it in a bag on a flat surface and transferred without issue after patch 22. Haven‚Äôt tried containers though.
---
I like that the last few have been doable with a gun since I run a commando build, but today‚Äôs was just annoying. Robots + the freeze thing was brutal.
---
Wow thanks for the info. Went to the rusty pick and scored 2 armor pieces that reduce damage and now the shotgun is insane out of vats too
---
lol bloodied again lol while i agree, why "optimize" almost exclusively means bloodied. No one should be forced to do anything other than picking up the corresponding perk card for extra damage, in a non competitive adventure game. There were bullet sponge enemies before, now almost everything is bullet sponge. Anything that doesnt rapid fire is just basically means, come hit me. I used to try almost every gun, especially legendaries i get for the day, but now headshots, leg shots, critshots just a BB-gun attack.
---
Eh I‚Äôd say about 10-20 minimum
---
Firstly dropping nukes and the byproduct of destroyed camps is intentional, it‚Äôs why no one is near monongah and cranberry bog. Secondly if a pvper wants to fight players there are designated areas for turf wars, the workshops and dare I say it nuclear winter
---
The seasons were a huge addition for me. Love the challenges and the prizes.
---
It's kind of the worst game ever, but also kind of the best? It's got its hooks in me for sure has for 8 years.

I cannot give up my weight reduction perks or modified excavator power armor. I wouldn't be able to fast travel without them.

Why a Kevin through?

Whiskey + party boy/girl is great for melee.

Submit a trouble ticket.
---
I am here to make sure everyone else has a good time. Building stuff in camps, giving stuff away, selling stuff cheap, helping out.
---
Heavy Bloodied Vampire.
---
lemme guess, you got anti-armor two shot explosive bloodied 25% faster junkies crippling magic legacy legendary?
---
It's not just those, One Wasteland changed every event, so I'm seeing a lot of players trying out old low level events to see whether they're worth grinding, or just re-exploring areas. It will pass and nukes will fall again soon.
---
Fair point. But you're also forgetting the time before vending machines were a thing and we didnt know where anyone's base was unless they were in our party.
---
PVPers dont give a shit, dude. lol
---
Well I didn't quite mean to say she's SEXY, just really... Cute üòÖ Like, she seems so carefree and genuinely happy to roam about just watching dem birds, as if the world hadn't gone to shit.
---
Considering the alternatives for female camp companionship though - ms. Space migraine and the one-hit-wonder woman - I guess she's also the sexiest for her character alone. I'd have to see her in a red dress or nuka-girl outfit before I judge though.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn
---
Which shop?
---
I just pick them ip and lob them to alert enemy's while I'm stealthed
---
They have a aoe agro sound effects that attracts enemy's
---
For me, it's more because I love grinding in games. And Fallout 76 provides me with a bunch of stuff to grind. Personally, seasons quite drew my attention more to the game. It's the sense of progression and moving forward. I've got 2 characters built up with a third soon to be worked on.
---
U had to be pretty stupid to be building bases back in white springs and bottom of watoga back in the old days
---
Agreed...dont check till 30 sec left
---
Times like these I wish they make the 150 scrip limit unlimited until the event is over
---
Before I spoil it for you, you should have completed the Ally quest line for commander Daguerre! Sorry... Maybe I should've put a apouler Warning in the title?
---
I've tried but haven't seen a difference between 1* Demolition vs 5* Demolition. Am I crazy?
---
I'd have disconnected if I knew I was coming but I saw it say nuke inbound as I was on my bench and I didn't worry about it until the shockwave started and then flame engulfed me and my bunker and then everything went boom lol
---
The Energizer bunny.
---
There is a new bug that allows players to automatically imitate pvp with you, without you reciprocating pvp. The only way to prevent is always be in pacifist.
---
Try some formula-p, this will reduce the spread of any weapon to a pin prick! You will have to take two or three of them though.
---
People still build in Whitesprings, lol.
---
But people also nuked spots where there would be a high nuke flora count to, like the top left of the map. Seen quite a many bases up there get nuked.
---
couldnt they just bend the front/back center of the mesh towards the center of the character and create an illusion of, skirt hanging down?
---
I got commander daguerre Possum skirt and when she sleeps, the skirt sometimes even goes even higher, as if it got tangled or pulled up, revealing the buttom obviously. Of course beth wont bother with such a small nit  pick, tho.
---
What is especially annoying is that Floater Grenades are the only Bullion gear that drops without knowledge of the Plan.
---
So it's like 7 Days to Die then lol Such a shit game yet amazing!
---
And for me it auto completed today so couldn't do it on my heavy gunner....
---
Lower then no npc?
---
You‚Äôre reaching for the outrage on this one.
---
Wait daily ops is supposed to end??
---
I actually really like these grenades. I totally hear what you‚Äôre saying, and you‚Äôre right. If you have explosive weapon, shoot the weapon where you want to throw the grenade. It will proc and explode. The acid and flamer ones really help melt some of these newly-buffed creatures, even scorchbeasts.
---
DOT is so underrated in this game.
---
Calm down, Dunning-Kruger
---
Military fatigues - tactical rig combo is not an environmental suit
---
No man, just get addicted according to the stats you want debuffed and giv'er. 
---
For information on "magic" effects, you can read more on this sub, but it will only affect you if your rifle is also a shotgun, or if it goes close to or higher than 200 fire rate.
---
For the patch damage, the consensus seems to be that junkies is roughly on par with AA.
---
It's because Ballistic Gutsies have armor penetration, so it doesn't matter what armor you wear when fighting them.
---
The only successful tactic is stealth, which does not work in ops...
---
I think demo expert only effects truly explosive guns like a missile launcher
---
Trading. There are plenty of super high value trades going on, not to mention people being happy to trade flux of one type for flux of another.
---
That would be great! Like a charging station or something, where she can just hang out for a while longer
---
IDK how to trigger it but it happens to me time to time, especially back when i did not complete the quests for Com. Daguerre.
---
I didn't say daily ops and op clearly mentions events
---
Are you using the legendary charisma perk?  That doesn't count for sharing perks.  Haven't seen anything else that would cause what you're experiencing.
---
How much were you selling purified water for? You may have deserved it /s
---
What is gold bullion for?
---
Right the perks themselves are not incorrect. Sneak attack doing 2.3x damage, is still accurate. The damage calc itself is multiplive, but the total damage output is still additive. 200 x 2.3 = 200+ 30 +200 +30
---
At least that would make them kind of fun.
---
What isn't clear from your vid is whether you have any legendary perk to increase charisma. Unfortunately the charisma increase legendary perk does not allow you to use the increase to share perks. Therefore you need 3 points actual charisma to share a 1* card.
---
times like these I wish they would just follow Elder Scrolls Online‚Äôs lead and do a player bank, allowing item transfers between each character
---
And those grenades are pretty trash too... No one I know uses any of the grenades in the game... They either bounce to random places, gets sucked into the ground, kills yourself or does little to no damage!
---
Honestly I find it ugly looking. I guess that‚Äôs the catch with these weapons, right?
---
Awe I'm sorry. Do you need help?
---
I feel the same, felt more tanky in combat armour
---
No. It‚Äôs a new feature.
---
I‚Äôm just a casual player so take it with a grain of salt, but a railway rifle w/automatic reciever really helped me. The ammo is made out of steel only, so it‚Äôs easy to craft. And you get your ammo back off the enemy.
---
I'm surprised the super reactor only costs 40 points.
---
Thank goodness. To many time things lately. Haven't had time to play anything else.
---
Don't worry, I understood what you meant. I just intentionally misinterpreted it because I have a messed up sense of humor.
---
I do agree though, Athena kind of seems like a female version of Data (an android from Star Trek The Next Generation). Except, she does not feel compelled to remind people that she is a machine all the time like Data does...
---
It‚Äôs only boosting the actual explosion, so the difference between 1-5 is minimal.
---
New feature/game mode
---
Only changes may be additions to enemies, maps, and game types. Possibly loot table additions or changes, but no idea if that is confirmed
---
Yeah probably changes for BOS stuff.That one bunker in the cranberry bog is no longer flooded and has some design changes as well.
---
i've just sold one in my vendor for 4500caps (tbh - it took more than a week to sell it from vendor because noone wanted to buy it). 2nd one is displayed on the wall in my camp because.. you know.. its fancy :)
---
From my point of view - yeah, caps are worthless now, unfortunately. When i had not every serum recipe in game - i spent all my caps on them, threw mid-rare outfits, plans, ammo to vendor and got maybe up to 50k caps every day. Now i really dont know what i should do with caps i have - i'm spending 6k every week for bullions and always compensating this expenses by selling stimpacks/radaways/clean water to station vendors when there are too many of them in my inventory. I'm using fully bloodied and got my uniyelding FDCWR combat armor very long ago (more than year ago) partially - from trades, partially - from drop, and now its SO unrealistically expensive in trades so i have no idea how i'd get it if i'd want to get it nowadays (yes, you can try to roll secret service armor for right prefixes, but, i don't know - it could take YEARS to get right set, if you enough unlucky. Except of prefixes - there is no difference between combat armor and ss armor - according to how armor working in this game - if you have \~350 ballistic armor - you have best possible damage reduction from armor in game, because on values over 350 - difference in real damage reduction is almost inperceptible). But by the other hand - mid-tier uniyelding armor pieces are not too rare in player vending and it will take maybe couple of days to get complete uniyelding set, meybe not the same set, maybe without useful 2nd and 3rd prefixes, but it will still be uniyelding and it will work as presumed. About weapons - i always been melee/heavy (because imo - perception based build are lacking of versality - you cannot stop consuming ammo, you reloading every 10-15 seconds in any combat situation, you always have no spare weight capacity because of low STR, etc), so as we got gauss minigun - now its WAY cheaper to get one with correct prefix than to trade something valuable or to get something from loot. For melee - i don't know why, but its very underrated. You can get something like bloodied power fist from even from vendors and its basically everything you might need outside of nuke zones and boss fights. Even now, after damage rebalance (nerf) - it killing almost everything with one punch into face - and you even don't need to use any perks for it (except martial artist maybe) - only correct mutations.
---
So yes, caps are worthless, but imo - almost everything valuable in game is technically not available anymore from any souces which involves caps. And i think that is the deliberate approach of game devs as they decided that they are not able to deal with caps inflation and consequences of duping. If any new thing will be more powerful than any old thing and if any such new thing will be not tradable - there will be no harm to the game ecosystem from all billions of duped items and caps, which was gotten by selling them, from their point of view. And, i must admit, that is partially true.
---
You beat it too hard, Willie! 
---
You sound like Sam from Master Harold and the boys.
---
Dude it‚Äôs been out 5 days lol. Sounds like you aren‚Äôt having bad luck at all for ***rare*** rewards.
---
Bloodied is best, than literally anything else @ 20% health, than junkies.  If you're scared about dying, try vampire's at 20% health
---
How do I do that?
---
The value of something is determined by either it's utility or tradeability for something with utility. A melee build has no use for a gauss weapon and they can't be traded so to the many melee builds out there over half the rewards for completing an end game quest now has zero worth
---
Got it.  Ghouls put you from caution to danger right back ..... the level 100 ones seem to see/hear you immediately no matter if you are invisible or not. ..... to me, they all seem to be buffed with the same mutation as all the enemies in the Daily Ops, where stealth is a complete no go.
---
Vendor bots
---
I want some hot pants for my Beckett. In that same sparkly red colour as the RR power armour please. I kinda asked for this months ago but it seemed to be overlooked?....
---
I've only done the one run so I don't know.
---
Use the perception skills because sometimes explosives move them to  weird place
---
Never used a floater grenade, what‚Äôs wrong with them?
---
&gt; because im level 30? 
---
Oh good then you aren't getting level 60 Yao Gauis and level 100 mutated bee things spawning for you.
---
&gt; also ‚Äúmake a better build‚Äù is a complete shit argument. sorry. not  everybody likes to have the same optimized boring build that everyone  else has. 
---
Offensively speaking all I run is Tank Killer, Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, Master Rifleman and 2 star Bloody Mess.  It is pretty bare bones in terms of build using the AP and damage boosting perks that every weapon class will use with their own variations of them.  Everything else is utility based.
---
&gt; i dont have access to most heavy guns and their perks. *because im level 30.*  
---
Good news you are going to be extremely powerful once you unlock all the relevant perks.
---
Well you‚Äôre absolutely right. It doesn‚Äôt track that
---
I'll inform the team, sorry about that one
---
They actually did scale up defences level, but no where near the degree to even make them if any use whatsoever.
---
All they seem to do is give a wider agro radius to your camp, yes you get attacked without turrets, but not as frequently or as much of a range!
---
I know, I know...don't rush the RNG.
---
Come and find me and I'll help you out with some violet flux. GT: TheNutrixx
---
Is it not even worth it to stack points in intelligence for that perk card?
---
Getting hit reduces your vats. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre getting hit more than usual so noticing it now.
---
bloodied and junkies frfr are pretty good
---
Yes this, or even better yet, can I get an option to auto drop all grenades, missiles, super nukes, 40mm grenades, cannonballs, .50 balls, railway spikes, and all the other useless garbage I get from events and other sources. Frankly the amount of this crap I have to drop just to move is ludacris. At least the explosives.
---
I want shelves to hold things and not just cases. There's that silver one that I've always liked but its encased in glass so you can't even put a plushie in it.
---
F
---
Whats wrong w it? is it dimmer?
---
One shot per 5 seconds makes Damage Per Second a ludicrous notion.  And that‚Äôs when the bow loads properly.  If you get hit in mid load, you have to start again and again until you stop getting hit.  Even splash damage stops the load in mid load.  And don‚Äôt get me started on VATS and the glitches with that and the bow.
---
Hell I just did it three times today and got no rare rewards. Just junk
---
And it was done in a team in under 8! (6.5 fastest)
---
All reactors cost the same.kinda sucks if you don‚Äôt want a giant generator.
---
Yeah, i noticed it too. Shame i used to use them to quickly get back into nerd rage if i was ever out.
---
I got nothing the first 3 days.
---
Bro this is a beautiful picture! Noce work! üíØüî•üî•
---
A good bloodied build is just fine as well.
---
Generally more guys than girls play this sort of game. I figured play the odds, use a male archetype.
---
Funny how excavator beats normal armour.. Can never leave mine cause carry weight bonus to good
---
There is a disease that drains AP whenever you get hit.
---
 "Shell Shock: Action Point drain from wounds"
---
I'd check and see if you have any diseases.
---
The smallest
---
Melee is now utterly unusable in boss fights.
---
20 damage to Earle or the SBQ is not a reliable dps for getting up close and personal with the most dangerous critters.
---
I mean non bloodied builds can deal lots of damage as well. Junkies, anti armor are still pretty good it just a couple shots more In fact I plan on converting into a full hp build later once I get the weapons.
---
I started using it more often since the update, can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs actually any different.
---
Idk how. I have it to my phone now from playstation ap...
---
Walk to CAMP projector thing. Press triangle. 
---
Profit.
---
Well. Lose profit because of building costs, but the structures are still in the game memories, you won‚Äôt have to actually rebuild anything.
---
yeah the point is the game is brutal for low level characters right now. my level 65 (who i personally think has a pretty decent build, stealth rifleman) seems to be doing fine. using more ammo, sure, but thats not a big deal. granted i havent played much on that one since the patch. but my low level strength i was talking about is just getting fucked. things got a bit easier when i started collecting power armor. when the patch first came out i didnt have any, and it was almost unplayable.
---
I may put the game down until they balance it with the new weapon and armor leveling. 
---
No point spending scrip or caps on level 45/50 gear when it will be the new level 30/35 gear in a month or so.
---
Yeah I still run mine
---
You can‚Äôt farm the rare rewards. You do it under 8min and that‚Äôs it for rare rewards for the day.
---
sent and cav occupy the same slot
---
For some reason I‚Äôve noticed if the head is behind its own body it hits but doesn‚Äôt count and does no damage,like it‚Äôs body was a barrier.
---
I haven‚Äôt had the issue as long as I‚Äôm careful with positioning.
---
huck em
---
There is a type of collection that you get alcohol from.I remember whiskey being in there quite a bit.Also there was the old Smirnoff estate down by Lake Gad but it was blown up by the finlandia raider gang.This is a true story,Absolut it is.
---
yeet to delete
---
Atom shop, like icons.
---
Thanks!
---
Gotta equip the camp skin in the atom shop, next time you place your camp node down the skin should be there
---
Ah yeah same as the others. Not sure I'll ever use it until we get the CAMP shelters as the fusion is already huge. But good to know, thanks for sharing.
---
It works, I destroyed a griefer camp with all of my leftover explosive bait a couple of days ago, I admit, not my finest hour
---
Yeah I also got 4 burrow signs and lucky enough to get 2 additional rare plans one of the 2 days and today got nothing I'm feeling real depressed not getting anything
---
It happens to me too, whenever it shows "Rewards" for the ranks, does it just have a grey picture?
---
I play on Xbox so I'm not entirely sure, but it seems like something leftover from the PTS maybe? I believe the same thing happened on there
---
Mine work? I hung up the dinner options one.
---
I got the glaive plans on my ranged character. üò¢
---
Another quicktip is that if you find the broken tube first or second you can repair it and turn in the quest without grabbing the other 2.
---
The completion requirement only looking for a crafted radio vac tube.
---
I think you are very lucky.
---
Tried it 3 times so far and havent got anything special.
---
Does anybody know the drop chances for the rare plans in Daily ops?
---
Edit: completed it every time in under 8 min.
---
That sucks. Every once in a while I'll put up some fasnacht masks up at list price. Only one of each at a time though.
---
Only time I'm on an Op Team and don't join when one person starts is because I'm in the middle of prepping for the next one if I'm low on ammo/supplies from doing multiple SBQ and Earle runs in a row.
---
It seems like once you hit the second relay, some 8-10 Gutsy's and a bunch of robobrains suddenly start falling from the ceiling and assaulting you. Everytime we'd clear them out a dozen more would come hurling at us.
---
What‚Äôs an overseer ticket. I‚Äôm lvl 180 and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing.
---
No senpai!
---
I've done it for four days or so and got Vault 94 STASH, 2x Cage Lights (same run) and the Liquid Courage Recipe. Father in law tagged along and got Super Reactor which I bought off him (God it's impractically large for a 100pwr unit.... Should be 200-300 power for the size of it).
---
Theres a tinker's bench at crater without going into the loading screen, as well as one about 100 yards SE of the crater. Its unmarked but is also a good place for circuits.
---
At the moment, √∫til the. If is fixed, I would recommend going around with pacifist enabled
---
I got whisper in the dark and valley galleria signs
---
That‚Äôs very bizarre. You might have to do a reinstall. What system are you on?
---
Bloodied still good but for daily ops wise I like using vampires,two shot or anti armor
---
Paying it foward at its finest.folks like you make this community what it is.thank you
---
There's no reason to run silos and drop nukes right now. The combination of the damage rebalance, daily ops, and Armor Ace have killed my interest in Earle and the Queen entirely. Pretty much the same for Imposter Sheepsquatch, but I still want the Fixer plan, so there's a little motivation there.
---
Go [here](https://help.bethesda.net).
---
Depends on what weapons you use. I tank those with a vampire's mr. Handy.
---
Eh, I use the floater grenades to wake up the behemoth at that one location, also any queens mireslurks, just so I dont have to loose my stealth right away
---
True, this fits into exploit and griefing (it wouldn‚Äôt count as griefing if the other party willingly engaged in pvp)
---
I just equip them and throw them
---
It might be my taste but while there are some I like they are a bit more bland compared to other games honestly it might be that I was expecting better as I played fo4 and fnv first and they had much better tracks but they aren‚Äôt terrible
---
May that man only find tin cans whenever he needs aluminum
---
God I would love Berserkers to get a buff. No more repairing armor, freeing up an agility space that white knight took up and running around in only a harness and reclaimed deep mining gas mask.

Lvl 99 in the new season
---
Yes, every time on PS4. I need it to end before fast travelling, it will be fun at rank 80.
---
The new Armor Ace Run. Level 99 Prize. Someone spent some Atoms!
---
Well he sure ain't your mate, guy.
---
I was the same for the longest time but now between Strong Back 4, the backpack High Cap mod, and 12 strength means that I can actually carry the same weight in and out of the PA.  So when I'm not running endgame stuff or ops I can mess around in my stealth suit.
---
No, I don't believe you do
---
I like it, except I'd suggest ranged be 10/20/30/40/60 so you get more of a return if you invest the entire way.
---
I always get annoyed at dimishing returns on skills and the like. I believe specialization should reward you more as you go, not less.
---
If you run full health I would say anti armor and explosive
---
Lmao release was rough..

There was an infamous bug that was addressed over at least 12-14 months where gooifying/disintegrating an enemy made it so they either didn't respawn anymore until a server restart, or respawned as an immobile, non-attacking, unkillable husk of its former self. However, to this day you can still see enemies spawn like this, though less commonly, and it's frustrating to encounter.
---
Of those choices, since you like to use VATS, the 25% Less VATS Cost would be the way to go.
---
Oh yes you can tank with one of those but you can't dish out damage any longer.
---
I recommend a vampires limb damage one to keep Earl's legs crippled!
---
Its feels like its more of a constant spawn.
---
Thanks.
---
Done it 4 days since release, these were my results:
---
Day 1. Plan: Vault 94 Jumpsuit;
---
Day 2. Plan: Super Reactor;
---
Day 3. Plan: Caged Bulb Lights;
---
Day 4. Plan: Burrows signs.
---
In all honesty, I just want the BoS outfit, it looks good in my opinion.
---
Lucky bastard. That and solar is all I want... Meanwhile I'm sitting in Caged lights, 94 STASH, Liquid Courage.... Ffs I'll get every reward BUT those two I swear haha
---
I‚Äôd submit a ticket [here](https://help.bethesda.net) and depending on their response, if it doesn‚Äôt work, try a reinstall.
---
I don't think so as headgear doesn't add any defensive benefits.
---
I have a low level charcter I make just to make level up for the daily challenges a lot easier. Unless there is some unspecific level were it starts to become brutal for players. At level 3 using a level 1 machete I was able to do the Mr. Handy farms even solo.  I'm level like 5 now and on my way to the air port. So waiting to see were this brutal level comes into play.  Might keep this one around and grind it up to do the last trophy and side with the raiders in the gold quest.
---
I use both perks. The arc one does work. The blast radius is fucking tiny even with grenadier, so I‚Äôm not sure if it benefits or not. I‚Äôd guess it does. But that‚Äôs just even more of a reason to increase it, because if it lands more than like 2 feet away from someone, it doesn‚Äôt do shit.
---
You can't sell them, dropping them destroys it and it deals little to no damage.
---
I got a lot yesterday. I had parasites and needed to kill every one at westek to eat.
---
F*ck Daily Ops with Robots in them.
---
Bottom Text.
---
It's the robots. For some reason they spawn disproportionately higher compare to the Blood Eagles and Super Mutants.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean, we did elder first run and nada.
---
It makes more sense to kill Earle first since the Queen has a 30 minute timer.
---
VATS cost would be huge for me. I use it on my gatling all the time, too.
---
Block them, don‚Äôt talk to them, and move on.
---
I have the same problem.  I've got I think two or three turrets that were destroyed but I can't fix them and I can't replace them in Build mode.  I placed them up on some platforms since my camp in the Mire, I wanted to keep them elevated for some added protection.  But my budget is maxed and I can't replace them.
---
Looks like I'm going to have to move.  Shame.
---
Dodgy lets you avoid incoming hits at the cost of AP. Do you run that perk?
---
I will have to disagree with Grenades not being any good
---
It is true I would like a little more damage,before the damage nerf my Nuka grenades did around 1200 to 1300+ 
---
I do have all the Mutations that Don't interfere with energy and ballistic  damage though ,and of course I will use either + damage or + sneak damage chems or foods
---
But usually i don't bother with chems unless its a huge juicy group of mobs
---
The Level 100 Super Mutant Demolishers and any other that are level 100
---
The base with Max Explosives expert,max grenadier,and a junkies weapon equipped + nerd rage, The junkies weapon being equipped gives you + 150Pts  extra damage or more on grenades ,BTW the Added damage for Junkies applies to all ranged weapons, but the amount varies depending on the weapons base damage, as far as i can see , the nerd rage gives you +20 % more damage on top of the base damage 
---
With a sneak plasma grenade attack 2 will do it or with a Nuka quantum grenade,which does a tad over 1,018 points of base  damage without nerd rage usually just one but i like to throw 2 /one on him and one either just in front or just behind ,depending on the terrain in case he moves too far ,with good aim and a bit of luck he might eat both ,or his buddies will too
---
the 1018 damage is without nerd rage btw 
---
The reason I don't have nerd rage equipped  ATM, is My int is only 6 atm and  its 5 points for explosive expert,3 points for the perk that lightens energy ammo sorry i forgot the name( The Energy bit is for my Gauss mini gun Ammo,and my plasma caster and other things,in case of Scorch beast problems ,Came in handy Scorch beast's now  sometimes attack Berkley springs as part of the Defend mission there and  2 points of the int is from the legendary perk for + int  will be working to get it to +5 int so i can get back to nerd rage Oh and either full SS Unyielding with one SS Chameleon for sneaking 
---
\+ with all the Aid packs for Fortifying Atlas ,I got around 75 to 100 Grenades of each type, +,heck one box alone gave me 12 plasma grenades, + I can make all except the Floater grenades,Super Duper helps but I still wish the Legendary Perk Ammo Factory helped with explosive's,I got it so I don't have to worry about,Gauss or 50 cal much anymore,or any type ammo actually ,went right  past floaters to Dynamite Bundles, they are fun to throw at groups of Super Mutants  scorched and seem to have a fairly big AOE and because lots of times when you throw they all run either toward you or away  together and if you toss just in front you can get up to 5 or more 
---
Most grenade recipes are not that costly in materials,well at least it seems that way to me, except for the gold needed for the 3 floater grenades or the dynamite bundle 
---
I might get the Floater Grenade recipes eventually, they are great for the level 50 mobs at the sky resort and the forest and a few other places ,The DOT effects are fun too.
---
\+ I just like throwing Grenades it's fun ,and with the added range ,and the throwing arc so you can see where it will hit, very easy to do
---
I mean so much of Harpers ferry,and other locations like the Steak House are  made for grenading,you toss a grenade or grenades in doors or down holes in roofs and floors, boom problem solved .
---
 At the moment I am a Stealth,Heavy Gunner with  Junkies  Flamer( The Flamer seems to work as silenced,so i get lots of stealth kills with it so far) , Nuka Quantum Grenade,Nuka Mines,Plasma Grenades and mines and Dynamite Bundle,but to avoid waste i use all explosives ,and of course i have tons of other weapons in storage and on me
---
The Junkies Gauss shotgun is great with the short scope ,and  With skeet shooter to keep the pellets close together I can snipe across several streets in harpers ferry and i get up on the roofs and snipe the 3 turrets in the area by the stairs ,of course after the damage nerf I lost about roughly 400 or more  points of damage but the base without perks is still around 700 + so stil a great weapon for sniping,unfortunately it can't be silenced but still even at rang it can kill but takes a fair amount of shots now 
---
But since gauss weapons do explosions now, i get more damage and since it's per pellet it adds up fast  especially at close to mid  range .
---
But my favorite until i get tired of it will be my Junkies flamer 
---
Throw a Nuka quantum Grenade,or a few Plasma or just Nuka Grenades  from up high,then jump in and flame them on the way down 
---
Fun times in Harpers Ferry
---
It is hella fun to sneak around Harpers Ferry and place Nuka Mines around and then troll Super Mutants or scorched onto them 
---
And I still love hearing a Flamed Charred Dead Super Mutant saying
---
"You Hit Like A Rad Roach"
---
But I understand if it's not fun to you to throw Grenades,it's not fun period
---
After all we all play for enjoyment ,and if something is not fun for you it's not fun to do in game for you
---
But for those of you who think you  might enjoy it give it a try,
---
I want perk loadouts too!
---
Damn, I must‚Äôve missed that when I looked through it lol. Dude was level 451. Now I gotta grind cause I really want them lol
---
How do you transfer stuff? I‚Äôve been thinking about trying something like this but it‚Äôs tricky enough I don‚Äôt wanna mess with it.
---
I didn‚Äôt have time to play long enough to do the ‚ÄúKill 3 Legendaries‚Äù one. Unless ‚ÄúUranium Fever‚Äù pops, I‚Äôm not going to get them quick.
---
I'm fine with sharing those perks when toxic bloodies are being greedy, but just dont do that to people who dont do shit like that, and you're all good in my book!
---
Basically the armor comes to far off the actual power armor frame, which lets you see way more of the frame that‚Äôs under the armor model. It results in the chest sticking way to far out and creating a big gap around the neck area, it also allows you to see the frame under the left arm when using some of the heavy weapons in first person view, mainly the .50 cal. It‚Äôs just graphical issues, nothing that affects the performance of the armor, but greatly annoys OCD people like myself.
---
Hold the phone here... ive been thinking about this a lot lately... 
---
Now, I dont like when someone destroys my camp either... but aren't we supposed to have raider players? Evil, trash humans... being evil trash humans? 
---
I say we don't complain about it. I say we group up. Find the raiders, and kill them. Together. As many times as it takes. Troll hunters. A new faction of the wasteland.
---
Yeah buddy, I second this. I spend like 20 minutes after a Queen fight trying to locate all my kills since it usually involves tons of enemies and covers a wide area, and looting during the fight isn't a great idea.
---
I use 3 of my characters specifically as alts because everything weighs so much.
---
The Collector holds god rolls and other collectible things, the trader holds high value rolls and event/holiday/rare plans and outfits, and the mule holds gunpowder and scripworthy legendaries. The space I save on my main is a godsend
---
I never cares for locks just ignored half the ones I came across
---
Send them dick picks. They'll stop
---
How are doing without Hard Bargain 3? Doable?
---
Yeah, I covet them like nothing else on the board!
---
I read the robot one is tough but having Troubleshooter's armor takes 15% damage off with each piece.    
---
I did on for the first time last night by myself. I died once and finished between 12-13 minutes. I got a cool Bomber Jacket outfit for it and the rest was normal stuff.    
---
My 2nd character is a Shotgunner and does a lot of damage but not like it used to. In VATS both characters hit hard. Enemies in that ops had both ballistic, energy, and threw explosives so IMO find gear that does good protection against all of that.    
---
Rifle builds got hit hard with the damage nerf but don't give up on it. How damage is calculated has changed. Weak points haven't changed. Headshots still do a lot of damage and if you can cripple a leg then they can't move well.    
---
I would suggest focusing more and solo gameplay until you get back into the groove of things.
---
T65 bc strangler looks dumb.
---
That‚Äôs interesting
---
Yeah gatling is a great "marksman" heavy weapon
---
LMAO I‚Äôll take that in consideration!
---
Sure
---
That's not a very clear woosh. People miss stuff like that all the time, it's not obvious that you're staying to loot.
---
I've heard there's a way to start PVP without you shooting back, they're probably looking for easy kills.
---
If you have pacifist on you're safe regardless.
---
Stranglerheart bc T-65 looks dumb
---
Also poison damage more rad resist and the DR difference is negligible - if ur over level 300 wearing t-65 and carrying a heavy gun I just assume ur brain turned off playing this game long ago
---
I don't think you can build atom shop items though I could be wrong.
---
I got mine sticking in a tree to save on room. . https://i.imgur.com/CxBALWv.jpg
---
It halves pipboy light. Noticeable when switching view, because it works in 3rd person just fine.
---
Both of my characters have finished Wastelanders but have not finished the main quest and launched a nuke. üòÜ    
---
New content is what is the highest priority for me. Not a big fan of Seasons as it's a repetitive grind. They need to change up the Challenges for it.
---
My camp was on the edge of a nuke but far enough away I thought it would be fine. As I‚Äôm running up to it, half of my building starts exploding and the entire thing looks like a bomb went off and obliterated one side of the structure. Luckily it wasn‚Äôt a complete loss and I could restore it after harvesting a few more materials. But it was a lesson that if a nuke is coming down near your base ... leave the server or at least don‚Äôt go near your base. It only started exploding as I ran up, so I think you have to be close enough for it to render if it‚Äôs near the outside of the circle and not auto destroyed within.
---
Banner on top of the perk/special screen.
---
Go to your perk screen, right at the top are legendary perks, it's like a like bar across the screen.
---
Go to the very top of the regular perks screen (keep pressing up).  You should see ‚ÄúLegendary Perks‚Äù up there, which you can click to get into them.
---
Go to your perk cards, look at the top of the screen.
---
If it's not there you need to update your mods.
---
Is unarmed damage bugged rn?
---
I have done so.  My last encounter didnt work out that well though.   Scorched earth dropped twice and the a hole murdered me after the event while I was trying to loot.  I've ignored, blocked and reported to both Beth and microsoft but it still doesnt change that I lost my loot.   I normally dont mind a bit of PVP but this individual took no damage and shredded me through med ex, buffout and at least 10 super stims.
---
Bloodied, AA. Vampires.  Vampires is situational, but very good at times.
---
Honorable mentions to Two Shot and Quad.
---
I thought I was insane bc I use to wear the Deep Mining Mask and the light was bright but when I put on the mask I cant see for shit
---
So are other melee weapons!
---
In fact not a single weapon adds up to the correct total since the nerf!
---
Pacifist doesnt protect you from being murdered, just from fighting back.
---
Yeah I've seen people wanting vampires stuff recently kinda cool it's meta now.
---
Thanks bro!
---
Jesus, thanks for the heads up, I was gonna do just that, it wold had been so infuriating, I think I am just gonna keep dear old fusion generator
---
Hehe as tempting as that sounds, I feel like I may end up the A hole if I do.
---
MY mods! thank you
---
Reminder, you can take the photo while in the vault, and then leave.
---
Unless you use jetpack mod for secret service torso. That shovel clipping drives me crazy
---
farm whitesprings nuke with an energy weapon and you will get what i mean
---
You have an extra 7 special points which are probably from lehendary perks.
---
CHARISMA LEGENDARY PERK dosent allow for sharing perks.
---
I would leave the server to be safe, I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter if you are there or not, it'll go boom and whatever is in the blast radius will be destroyed. I am a junk hoarder so I had the resources to repair but it took a toll on my supply, sucked pretty bad to be honest. Guy who dropped it could've given me a heads up lol I know the game tells you it's dropping but I'm so used to people hitting SBQ or ACP I didn't think it would be near me
---
Grenades aren‚Äôt worth anyone‚Äôs time especially floaters it‚Äôs so annoying they act like it‚Äôs such a big deal your dropping them. ‚ÄúWoah dude! Are you sure you wanna drop these grenades??? Dw we got you we will toss 500 of them on your next event we got u bro XX!!!!!!
---
I thought that I had picked a perfect camp spot when I plopped my CAMP down west of Sunnytop Station -- beautiful vista, flat area, and seemingly perfect. I remember thinking, "Gee, why isn't this spot claimed more frequently?"
---
About ten minutes after I finished building up a beautiful home, I figured out why. It would regularly be in the blast zone for any nuke hitting Monongha Mine.
---
I didn't think to log out before impact. To be honest, I don't think that I would have. I just watched as my home was totalled from a nearby and safe distance. The destruction was glorious. I laughed for the whole evening.
---
I also promptly found a new location for my CAMP.
---
**Edit:** [I did save a screenshot!](https://imgur.com/11AcIqA) Bask in my brilliance.
---
It worked for you? Maybe we did something wrong? Oh well.
---
Did you use the fancy shotgun?
---
As that's bugged atm, and giving generic ammo rather than weapon specific ammo.
---
I like your point even tho I‚Äôm only level 176. However, this leads me to ask, is the spit that earl Williams shoots poison? If so the strangler heart sounds much more appealing. I also heard they nerfed the poison  resistance due to it stacking. I‚Äôd like to confirm that.
---
Yikes. I just paid 15k for one. But I‚Äôm happy now.
---
Ok, it's F76's problem for crashing, not mine. I have MSI RX570G, Ryzen 3400g, and 16GB ram.
---
Solo it felt like 3x the normal amount for some reason lol I can only imagine a 4 stack is going to be insane
---
They are infinitly spawning and give ammo and healing items so you can sit in there infinitly killung them.
---
Today sucks (freezing robots) but other days they are easier to kill.
---
Pacifist, in general, will prevent PVPing from being enabled.
---
I did noticed you have to be inside a camp structure , they wouldn‚Äôt explode on camp items outside ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Aslong as its just a temporary bug and this isnt how Beth intended melee to be because this is just pathetic rn. Im doing almost as much damage on my heavy gunner and my bloodied unarmed, except my heavy gunner can do the damage from 30ft away at 20√ó the rate.
---
TBH I'd be perfectly fine with this.
---
I personally don‚Äôt think so
---
But value is if you sell it you can‚Äôt so value is not really a contributed to them. But I think a shared stash between characters would solve that issue.
---
I just throw them.. it's fun trying different stuff.
---
Shuush, do you want them to nerf your heavy gunner too!
---
How did you get it so detailed, is that just the pc graphic capability compared to the consoles graphic
---
I just gave all my spare plans to some dude called sky is this u
---
I can confirm that this happens quite often.  Especially at whitesprings and westek.
---
What perk do you share?
---
I was debating myself as well. But I ended up going for the t-65. I like the way it looks. The strangler heart doesn‚Äôt look good in my opinion. And it‚Äôs supposed to do acid damage to nearby enemies. But apparently it got nerfed so now it only does a tiny bit of damage? But honestly I didn‚Äôt think I would be missing out on a small amount of acid damage. 
---
I also don‚Äôt care much about damage resistance between the two. In the end, I went with whatever I thought looked nicer. I only wear power armor when I fight the queen so I can make good use of my heavy guns. Other than that I just keep it on my inventory.
---
It usually gives you random ammo of each type,.38,.44,.308,.50,fusion cells,gamma rounds,fuel,they dont drop fusion cores,plasma cores,ulctriate cores,rockets,and fatmans,for people who dont logically understand me,everything but heavy weapons.Completing the op will grant you two of heavy weapon ammo though
---
I play too much ops
---
Yeah. I‚Äôd be happy with it being a torso,or arm, etc. but nothing is definitely a bug.
---
Hmm. Must be, all I did was screen cap the photo from the gallery onto my computer then uploaded. No editing at all.
---
IMO, there needs to be a good set with at least 7 or more items in it as a Bundle. I'll decide for myself if I want everything in it or not. I'm not swimming in Atoms.    
---
I would like the return of the Halloween themed vendor machines and other stuff.    
---
Hanging skeleton. Gravetones. Moss. Smoke machines.    
---
Better yet a cauldron with flames on the bottom and an eerie green glow with a bit of smoke coming off the top. You can get plans during the whole month of Oct. from Halloween pun-named enemies and quests. The plans and recipies make Halloween themed skins for amor and gear, CAMP Items and food/drinks.    
---
The food and drinks provide better buffs when made with the cauldron. When done with a normal stove it only does so much. The Halloween theme food and drink also has a cosmetic effect like red eyes, demon wings, a tail, etc. for a few hours.    
---
IMO, the Halloween store in the far NE near the Red Rocket station would be perfect for a starting Halloween questline.
---
Thank you VERY much üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
It says in the menu;  in pacifist mode, you cant hurt other players and are choosing not to participate in PvP.  Other players can still murder you.  
---
 I was not participating in PvP, rather being murdered by some knobhead who claimed I "taunted him."  I was unaware the mothman dance offended people.
---
No worries. Perk Loadout Manager would be the main one that needs updating to fix your issue.
---
If you use Text Chat you'll need to update that too or it may mess with the Daily Ops results screen.
---
Also SFE, but that nags you if it's no up-to-date anyway.
---
I usually just YEET them I like seeing things go boom
---
I have a full set of Unyielding so that with some grape mentats and I max out.
---
Glad to hear they got the nod.
---
Nah but his little orb aoe thing does rad damage
---
Damn all these salty t65 heavy gunners downvoting my comment pretending like they aren‚Äôt strolling around in the dad shoe of power armor with thighs so thick they could crunch a crocollossus üò™
---
I stand by what I said- ur unoriginal and ur CAMP look like a Minecraft hut
---
This is why I am using Born Survivor (1-2 star) and eventually also share Team Medic. This awful bug which cannot let you use stimpack at times and then you waste few of them at once because you clicked several times...
---
Interesting. I‚Äôll message my friend and text it out later. We normally save the explosive bait for people that have trap camps.
---
Thanks worked for me also, only went too the missing link bunker. a soon the quest got done, didn't even do the next one . came back to speak with rose and now it was ok :)Thanks for your help
---
I never understood why people that had the plans could get them from random boxes but could not drop them
---
The settler backpack matches the armor colors perfectly, but it means you have to give Bethesda more money unfortunately.
---
ESO doesn't have limits either.
---
I know there is never anything special in them, but I don't craft ammo and I don't harvest materials, so I take a lot of joy in finding random things I actually need.
---
Use that wiki down below. Certain items give certain kinds of flux. Even then you need a certain amount of other items used at a Chem station in order to make them Stable.    
---
They don't degrade and you can store them. The Unstable kind will degrade into Inert Flux which is HEAVY but also provides 20% water(I think). If you suddenly get over-encumbered that's probably why.
---
If they do Im slapping on contractor, woodchuck and greenthumb and just building greenhouses n shit from that point on
---
I just got hammered by that boss. I was in there with one other player and they left to do Colossal Problem. Managed to get to the boss with a 3* Vampires LMG by myself. Any time I had to reload, I‚Äôd die and when I respawned, he was back to full health. Hard no from me.
---
Oh I see, that answers my question then. Ashame that legendary cards don't count. Would have moved my perk points around differently if I had known. :/
---
Edit: Well I have +2 from legendary card, so I'm guessing +charisma from things list unyielding also don't apply to sharing? Just points in charisma itself?
---
for my build, nuka quantum grenades have been treating me well. I horde grenades and use them for high level enemies to make less work or if something is out of range for guns
---
E: thought about it some more, it's not that grenades suck in this game, its that grenades have a specific time and place for optimal effect. It's kind of similar to how the syringer is not a weapon to inflict damage but a way to debuff an enemy. Grenades I think should be used to remove chunks of power at a time if your primary weapon is not chipping away as fast it should.
---
the post actually addresses the fact that lots of level 20-30 players are complaining about the difficulty and that it makes sense given thats when health ‚Äústarts going fucking nuts‚Äù....
---
You chose bloodied because you got the weapons? Interesting. Ive always been a full HP PA Heavy gunner, or whatever is my favorite gun, from Instigating LAR to regular fixer, to some shotgun to pistols. post one wasteland, As a tanky player, I could tank and keep using the average weapons for fun. Not anymore really.   
---
I also kinda meant as how the legendaries are crap, like you gotta get addicted , or be practically naked or be close to dying and glow during the day to apply real good damage. And dont get me started on explosive effect. I have an Furious explosive LAR, and somehow found explosive shotgun. OMG its super annoying, loud, and breaks the game for other friends. 
---
Right now Id be okay if we could craft out legendary weapons as SS armor. Otherwise major legendary overhaul is needed, which i know would never happen at this point on.
---
My problem isn't stash space.... It's the fact with One Wasteland there seems to be way more legendarys? I sell a chunk of 3* and at logoff time I've hoarded three times what I've sold that day... I've got about 40x 3* and growing rapidly. Beth really, truly does need to raise this limit *badly*.
---
jesus christ, I take an afternoon every week after collecting cool low level legendaries and track down low levels that will appreciate them... and this douche is fucking with them.. microcosm of the US right there
---
It is most likely dropped below where you placed it
---
personally i don't struggle with them. i can kill them quick enough but once again. This isn't meant to be easy.
---
Cool. I don't usually wear a helmet and I'd rather not have to.
---
This... I'm still ticked off.
---
Any PA + Emergency Protocols + Electric Absorption (1) + Nerd Rage (1) + Born Survivor (1-2) + Team Medic (1, share).
---
This is my standard build anyway (except last two perks).
---
I absolutely love it. I have a list of spots that I found lvl3 safes or terminals. As a heavy gun power armour build, I only have 2 points in ‚ÄúP‚Äù and could never open them...well not I can.
---
I know, but in groups of more than 5 Mr. Gutsies, it isn't even fun anymore. On top of that I haven't found a Daily Ops with more than one person, being myself.
---
I almost made the same mistake until I saw someone post about it a few days ago.  I really feel like it should let you share more with it on.  It'd make that perk much more appealing.
---
Yes, grey picture instead of the actual reward.
---
It is quite annoying, I dread getting to the last level and hearing that sound 100 times.
---
lol, when i first saw someone's screen in PA without all that clutter, I was like what is this. And this doesnt feel PA, its weird. and then i switched and never went back lol
---
When I do ops with my commando, I wear an old suit of protocoled X-01 and swap in dodgy in place of sneak and ricochet for serendipity.  I swap other perks, but those two are my added defense.  I used two stimpaks in the freezing robot op today, and never got into trouble.
---
The Gutsies are crushing you because you‚Äôre relying heavily on DR, and they have a skeleton key.  Unyielding doesn‚Äôt boost defense, other than give you more AP to burn for Dodgy, or possibly max out underpowered gains on perk like Barbarian.  Secret service has excellent stats, until you fight enemies that beat that kind of defense.
---
What I‚Äôm doing differently is min/maxing every percentage based defensive asset I can get.  Dodgy, Lone Wanderer, Ricochet, Nerd Rage, emergency protocols and wearing power armor.  I could care less about DR and ER, because that‚Äôs what gets calculated last, after the damage is fractionalized through a half dozen perks and power armor.
---
In my opinion, secret service armor is terrible.  It doesn‚Äôt provide the defense of even the worst suit of power armor, because it lacks the damage mitigation bonus.  If you play a stealth build, it can‚Äôt be shadowed so it falls behind in stackable bonuses that keep you hidden.  Aside from the jet pack gimmick, I don‚Äôt know what it excels at.
---
Done this event plenty. I'm exhausted of doing this event. But no Taxidermy plans.
---
If anyone has got the plans for the Wendigo statue  I I got caps.
---
I‚Äôm curious to see how your build is holding up. I never actually changed mine and even added three star richochet and I‚Äôve breezed through every daily ops so far. Are you doing the same with bloodied?
---
I haven't tried fast travelling during. I ended up going stealth, muting, and grabbing a drink while it went through.
---
Freezing is really strong since I noticed that it stacks. I was firing like 1 ice bolt per second with my Cryolator once I was freezed by many robots. Wasn't a big deal though.

You'd be suprised, there's actually a lot of efficacy buildwise crossing over. On the one hand, three pieces ss buttressed unyielding, one ss absestos lined bolstering chest, and one urban scout armor autostim; my dr/er is over 500, 25 poison resist... I'm at 40% health. Not to mention a bunch of mutations, five addictions lol. With the grounded mutation, I have my er higher than dr, but dont like using energy weapons anyway. I run a junkies explosive shotgun stealth, vamp and antiarmor shotguns as well (vats or no vats). In pa I got ghoulish to keep me alive in nuke zones, plus a bunch of solid heavy guns that I can swap out from the shotgunners. Emergency protocols, nerd rage, adrenaline, stabilized, and QoL that I can use when taking out, say, evasive for thru hiker, or barbarian for traveling pharm... My stats are 14/3/9/1/8/14/13 (got rank 1 electric absorp, rank 3 legendary strength, rank 2 legendary endurance, rank 2 ammp factory so far)
---
Latest patch notes:
---
  
---
&gt;Server Stability: Addressed a server crash that could occur during Nuclear Winter matches.
---
It got support 4 days ago :)
---
wait you get killed 6 times yet still finish in 8 mins?
---
I love the auto stim helps me a lot during daily ops
---
Thank you guys very much for the help
---
No. I watched that same video; the TSE 10mm submachine gun was doing around 16-55 per hit. the bloodied handmade was doing 205-315. TSE sub took way more shots to down the super mutant and it took more time too. But both weapons did fine.
---
Man I have wanted that bag for so long but can‚Äôt justify dropping $40
---
Seriously there is nothing wrong with the ops, the problem is the player not the mode. If my son and I can bust it out in under 7 minutes first try as a duo I see no issue. If anything the first day was the hardest and that is because I don't know the barrows that well.   
---
Seriously we got legendary perk cards time to buy some damn QoL and defense perks people.
---
I know this mate it is why i said do a mix of sent/cav. Like 3 sentinels pieces and 2 Cavaliers pieces. Then for 2nd perks mix Ap, poison, and rad resist. I usually have a set up similar to this for my armor.
---
2 Vanguards AP Sent.  
---
2 Vanguards Poison Cav.  
---
1 Vanguards Rad Sent
---
No, I didn't finish it. I had to leave the Daily Op.
---
On xbox theres still a glitch where they can fire their laser infinitely with no recharge time, so they just keep firing and it's so fucking annoying on bloodied builds, and having them be tanky af with one wasteland is just not fun
---
If you‚Äôre on xb1 come by my camp tonight and I‚Äôll craft you a new one
---
I‚Äôm a high level stealth rifleman with a bunch of legendary weapons. Instigating explosive and AAE mostly. With the legendary perks up a few points I can still destroy things in a few hits in stealth. It does need buffing but I won‚Äôt get into it. 
---
I also know that most new guys won‚Äôt have even 1 good legendary roll. Having to play a build with ordinary weapons or shitty effects would definitely suck. A level 10 and level 50 with basic weapons are likely the same effectiveness
---
I did it probably a thousand times before and never lost a single item. I‚Äôve even had the game crash and gotten back into the same server multiple times. Feels like something has changed.
---
The materials to fix an entire camp are expensive, depending on the level of complexity :(
---
Lo qu√©? Mobs are supposed to give you the ammo you use on them, except cores missiles and nukes. It gives random when you use 100% melee or the fancy shotgun (only one I know is bugged). I started one op with 1400 fuel and ended with almost 2k, I'm farming ultracite 308 right now. It's not random
---
I have literally no one to play with. I have done the event almost twenty times and never have I ever gotten into an op with another person. And these are my personal problems I've had with the mode.

---
what the fuck did Lead do this time?
---
I have 4 characters.2 PA and 2 stealth builds.
---
My PA 2 Handed build is level 360.Biggest problems I have after getting some of the new perks are in the daily ops which I hate in general.Actually first op with resilient robots was a bit crazy.I almost died twice and went through 20 stims.The exploding raiders was easy just annoying.The freezing mutants were not too bad.The freezing robots were hell died 4 times 3 of those was to the boss.I use xo1 Pa and a instigating fss super sledge.
---
My stealth vats commando does the same as before.Just won‚Äôt use for ops at all.Uses a ap ffr handmade.
---
My PA Heavy gun build does ok but it‚Äôs rather a 50 fifty affair.Have not tried in ops as of yet.Uses a furious ffr Gatling gun.Xo1 PA.
---
My 4th toon is more of a non combat qol perk build.Main defense is sneak with 5 Piece leather chameleon set.Weapon is a ap lever action and a instigating lever.Only use the 3 level 1 rifleman perks.Everything else is non offense perks.She is not very useful on any larger mobs or groups of anything really.This build mainly just sneaks past everything and maybe kill what is needed to get the task at hand done.So far with new changes she is fairly useless except to play as a change of pace.
---
Over all the changes to the game don‚Äôt really please me.I hate the ops and the overall is ok.Better xp everywhere I go but fighting with any character is just much more tedious.
---
I love how much of a beast that deathclaw looks with that grognak axe.
---
How did he destroy your camp? Pvp or nukes?
---
Man, sorry for your luck.
---
I've actually had pretty good luck with teams. Ran it in 6 minutes today with 2 other players. Went really smoothly.
---
Second run 3 others joined, and we barely got that done in just under 8.
---
Just go on YouTube, and type in the search bar "fo76 daily op rewards".
---
I haven't even purchased the plans to learn them and I still get them. I figure if I wanted them, I would have purchased the plans.
---
If I didn't have a lot of minor details and a shit ton of time put into mine I wouldn't care but I put a lot of time in building it and it's expensive to repair everything so I will definitely disconnect instead of just letting a nuke put a dent in my supplies if I can help it. If I had 1st and could story unlimited junk it wouldn't matter but I refuse to pay into this buggy mess of a game for benefits especially when I still crash daily, usually more than once
---
They barely do any damage for me. Only like 40 for the bosses while my gatling gun does slightly more per shot. When do they actually do lots of damage?
---
Okay have you joined a daily ops group? Like that is how it is done join ops group go do ops finish ops leave group.   
---
Don't have a group on your server make group get 2 others start daily normally a 4th will see and join boom 4 in the group. By the time you are done everyone gets the bonus xp from it and you 6 minutes of robot hell is over.
---
:)
---
ah ha. I thought I was losing my mind. few months back a blood eagle was giving it to me with a flamer. I was thinking "Oh shit yes, i can FINALLY play with a flamer" but when I searched there was nothing.
---
I never used companions for help in quests, but I‚Äôd happily overload them with tin cans and desk fans.  Didn‚Äôt Dogmeat have a fetch feature for loot that you couldn‚Äôt find?  That would be really nice.
---
Of course, I don‚Äôt know how the server would like 12 players with 12 dogs at the same event, so I‚Äôd take any improvement.  Corpse highlighting with a drug or helmet, an automatic loot toggle, whatever.
---
I'm unsure why I am being downvoted for this...  can anyone elaborate?
---
Vampires has been great for surviving in Daily Ops. I end up gathering quite a few Stimpacks at the end.
---
I haven't had to change anything. Have yet to die and 2 man elder all the ops so far.
---
Is there any information as to how much it saves?
---
I agree with this, but its way worse. i started a new character before the patch (was going for a pistol build). I already have a level 330+ and a 150+ (commando/heavy), so i figured id give it a go. After getting to about level 15 with this new guy, it was apparent i couldnt continue on this build, at least not right now. 
---
My level 15 pistol against a mob of level 15 anything never lasted. Knowing i wanted to complete the tadpole questline ASAP, it has really sucked doing the archer and hunter badge (I always choose Athlete, Archer and Hunter). Before, i could go to Morgantown and clear it out against level one enemies with my level 20 crossbow (lowest), no big deal, now i have to kill 50 kevel 20 enemies, with this thing. 
---
I changed from pistol to shotgun build and have too almost kill them with shotgun before finishing off with the crossbow (like the bear and syringer for hunter). While it is doable, it hasnt been particularly fun. Now i have to follow around other lower levels hoping they have as much trouble as me to get my revive and my good backpack.  
---
Im not really looking forward to moving forward since i have played several times already and know whats still to come (Rose quest and a cave üòê).
---
**Chaotic Good**
---
Same, did it today. Was low on water, far from my camp. Guy had 6 purifiers for 12 water. The 5th was locked and I was wanted.
---
Good luck!
---
Join a public daily ops group or start one &amp; go in when you have at least 2 other players.
---
If you are not in a group you will always do the op alone as they are instanced.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever died from a PvP attack and I always stay in pacifist
---
I created a team or join one about half the time, I got one person to join the group I created and they were a level twelve that crashed half way. Then the groups I joined never started an ops or joined me when I joined an op.
---
It's brutal. Did it once solo in about 35 min but I was ill prepared and did a lot of hiding for the last horde and boss. Geared up with 4x -15% robot damage armour/full ammo and attempted again, was set for 14-16 min since the last boss is pretty easy with the minigun, but nope, last enemy before that was invisible and I couldn't even finish. Spent 10 minutes trying to use grenades and splash damage but nothing worked. Now I'm out 25 stims and a two thousand 5mm for nothing.
---
Power Fist itself should have mod which would allow to use it while in PA. Basically Space Marine with Power Fist/Glove.
---
I just got the outfit today. The exposed skin would be fine when you aren't wearing some kind of mask, but otherwise yeah that is a problem. I use the Stalker Bandana to cover the skin.
---
Friends? Uhhh yeah totally, friends, of course I have friends. Loads. Trust them all like family, absolutely. 
---
... although, for the record, how might one not so heavily overturned with charm and kinship as myself go about having mules?
---
What mmo was that?
---
I went with the 65 for the simple fact that I doesn't require vault steel in order to craft it. It's enough of a time gated grind to simply get the gold, much less add yet another grind for legendary scrip. Also, after watching videos and doing the research there is very little difference as far as dr goes between all of the pa variants so might as well go with the one you think looks the coolest.
---
The plan or the glaive weapon itself?
---
Mine got nuked on the edge of whitespring. I didn't log out because I wanted to see what happened.
---
What was left was a husk of my home and everything broken. I thought it was awesome. Part of me just wanted to repair the workbenches and one stash and then keep it in ruins. It seemed game appropriate.
---
I‚Äôve got some good rolls like IE15 lever rifle,  IE15 hunting rifle, AAE15 hunting, TSE combat rifle 
---
The legendary effects are helping a lot. Before equipping follow through and take one for team I definitely felt underpowered. 
---
Rifleman still needs a buff because it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to be decent
---
I‚Äôd guess server stability is the primary reason Mr Looty doesn‚Äôt exist already.  The server wheezes and coughs up blood at a crowded SBQ as it is.
---
Being a cunt lvl 3.
---
As a tarantula owner I would dig having a pet spider at my camp
---
I was/am new enough to the game that I didn't know what to expect when a CAMP is located in a blast zone. \[Clarity for fellow neophytes: All that remained was the empty husk of my buildings. Everything else was gone.\] I was morbidly curious.
---
I'd spent over an hour building up the CAMP. I spent so many caps moving the deployer to get *just* the right spot that I wanted to maximize the flat area and get enough over the cliff's edge to build a wooden overlook. I probably should have been more upset, but I found it absolutely hilarious.
---
I also chose not to fix everything; I packed up and moved elsewhere to build something entirely new and different.
---
I can solo it under 8 min consistently.  Happy to carry anyone at any level if you want.  On PC.
---
I've swapped it for another card, and fortunately had no problem removing it.
---
Highly dependent on what weapon you want to use as a main.
---
I run a shotgunner build on my current toon and this is my perk layout. [shotgunner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c8336f8&amp;d=sd2so2sp2p00pc2pe1pm1eh2cu2ic4a72an2a04l71lt2l32as2su2i10a80&amp;n=Shotgunner)
---
Does it mitigate the damage you take?  Because it explicitly states in the menu that you can be murdered. If I can just pop a couple stims and outheal any amount of dmg then I'll definitely turn it on.
---
It does say that, but when I‚Äôve been shot at/ shot it does 0 damage.
---
That's a brilliant idea. 
---
I occasionally see Whitespring getting nuked, but I assume that it's more done out of a desire to grief players than as an actual gameplay mechanic or benefit. Or an intense rage for the number of deaths that one experiences by going there at a lower level.
---
Not that I'm bitter or anything...
---
Yeah. The freezer swarms got to go... The least entertaining thing I have ever done in this game is being frozen again and again by every little spambot to the point I can't even fight back. I have no issues with swarms or bots. But the frozen spam made it horrible. 
---
TLDR   Too much Frozen Spam.
---
Ye? And what u gon do with 200k caps eventually when u got all the weapons u wanted
---
What,thats bull ive been given different types of ammo
---
[https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-76-hidden-side-quests-best/](https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-76-hidden-side-quests-best/)
---
That's not a downvote... that's just the truth of how the industry works. Gotta keep your customer base engaged and coming back.
---
As much as people complain about the gold limit, I really don't know what else I need from it myself. I got the SS arms/legs/chest, then the deep pockets and buttressed (or whatever the highest stat mod was)... that's it...  grabbed one of each backpack from the two factions... now I got near max again, with a ton of treasury notes and nothing to really spend it on. (I don't use power armor).
---
I throw anything that's throwable. Doesn't matter that they aren't useful. I like watching things go boom. For fucks sake, I've even been known to take out a Fat Man occasionally.
---
Per character.
---
You got it exactly right! I finally got my precious and it‚Äôs bugged? Why do you hate me, Bethesda?
---
Still is!
---
It is another casualty of the update like rifleman. 
---
Bows definitely need a buff to be viable and I want to see it happen aswell. This game needs to encourage more variety in builds
---
I feel like mini nukes and missle launchers need a buff aswell feel like they should be the strongest guns in the game
---
Congrats :) Thats how its usually work for very niche, but not very rare items - if you'll really try to find it - you will definitely find it and it will even not so expensive :)
---
Really love the Wastelanders one!
---
&gt; but you can control whether they are able to. 
---
That's just outright false. Apply to any situation that involves exploiting or getting around a system and it's clear how wrong that statement is.
---
* You can control whether or not a hacker can access your data.
---
* You can control whether or not a thief can get past your security system.
---
* You can control whether or not someone cheats on you.
---
Yeah, let's not blame the victim here.
---
Its actually pretty lame. I was so hyped to get it. But Its a one piece item, so it will break quite fast. and for some reason, it didnt feel like protecting me better than my BOS combat armors which has 86 something DR.
---
Its a bit of a hard grind but I would got for Secret Service and its buttressed mods. and maybe deep pocketed as well. You can re-craft it to get whatever legendary effects pleases you and turn what you dont like in for scrips.  I think my carry weight is near 420, about 20 points below max Excavator with calibrated shocks. If you get Adamantium skeleton, Its ridiculous how non PA is comparable to PA, i can take about 3-4 hits from big bosses and not die and i got no defense perks. I got the +200 poison resist tho.
---
My stupid ass didn't do that with the sword on my main, I swear.
---
No it‚Äôs terrible, in fact you should sell it to me for 15k  caps if you‚Äôre on Xbox.
---
I'm a Stealth Sniper and I'm fine where I am.    
---
My PER is exactly like that.    
---
END is at 2 for a QoL perk.    
---
CHA is 4 with only LW.    
---
INT is Gunsmith 5 and First Aid at 2. I got the Healing mutation so those items are less effective.    
---
AGI - I know I have Action Boy/Girl R3 and Thru-Hiker R3.    
---
Luck is automatically Starched Genes and Class Freak at max rank. My stealth one has 4 or 5 mutations.    
---
I also have Bloody Mess R3, Tormentor R2, and the crazy one at R1.    
---
I would say it is a good build but this update is so new we won't know until the long run.
---
I had one it was a shredder if you invest in it
---
:-)
---
Im a big fan of all thing explosive in this game, and i absolutely love the nade launcher.  While it's by no means the most powerful/meta weapon, it is alot of fun.   Adding some different dmg types that could be launched would spice things up considerably.  Variety is the spice of life after all
---
I feel like an SAS soldier with that outfit its amazing.
---
oh weird... yeah it's not there LOL.
---
That's a cool find.
---
Really? I was worried the lack of 2-shot or bloody would ruin it. Other than the commando or rifleman perks, what do I need?
---
I don't get it. What is so hard about getting a bloodied weapon lmao
---
In the current meta, absolutely. Check out angry turtle's video on the top legendary weapon effects. It over performs because of some change regarding explosive effects that someone has made them more powerful.
---
That is 1 sexy gun! 
---
well it's much better than a lot of fixers. you'd struggle to find a better fixer.
---
Yeah, it unloads when you get close.
---
&gt; Antiarmor Gutsies beat 50% of DR.
---
Don't they completely ignore DR?
---
Neocron
---
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you at all, I like all points if views it helps me make a better decision. I might just end up grinding for both since there nothing else to grind for really. Thanks for your input pal.
---
IMO, look at player vendors to save time and grinding.    
---
I have two chars who are mutated and have no paid more than 450 for a single one. I see them somewhat often and I'm on PC.    
---
If you get one you don't want then you have to start over. I value my time more than that kind of time loss vs little reward.
---
I made the mistake of taking the hack and slash perk because people said it was good, and after testing it myself i thought it was good and might make daily ops easier since there were so many clumps of enemies. Well it was an awful decision. First for daily ops because you move out of range of the uplink when in melee and in general because the corpses fly around constantly. At range this isn't as bad because you can see where they go, but when you're close  they fly behind or otherwise outside your FoV. 
---
I haven't had the confetti lunchbox yet, and I don't think I've grouped with someone sharing bloody mess but I'm not looking forward to it.
---
I think it would be hilarious if he did all that ‚Äúwork‚Äù for the brotherhood and then they don‚Äôt initiate him. Like that would be the biggest ‚Äúduck you‚Äù in history by the brotherhood
---
Also happy cake day
---
I recommend being bloodied you just do more damage overall plus stat boosts have all commandoes and need rage and demolition expert it‚Äôs a shredder I half invested in it and could one clip scorchbeasts
---
Anti armor and explosive both went up in the tier  lost beciase of how the damage is calculated now. Anti armor is still multiplicative so it‚Äôs in the top three of damage buffs. Explosive also gives you the ability to use demo expert for extra 60% damage. Unless you get a legendary fixer I‚Äôd use the handmade over the base fixer
---
I went there and didnt see anything
---
What perks do I need?
---
This is my heavy gun build.
---
[heavy gunner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c533eb8&amp;d=sq2sx2s32sr2l71ls2lt2a72a12a04i12ib4ip2id2eh2cu2pm1pe2&amp;n=Heavy gunner)
---
Fun and related aside, there's an achievement/trophy to be obtained if you're inside the blast radius when the nuke lands!
---
I've been told that you need to be close to the epicenter to snag it. I managed to get it on my first and only attempt, but an acquaintance didn't when he was closer to the outside than not.
---
What perks do I need to really get into it?
---
The wasteland is a harsh place.
---
You can repair all through your camp module.
---
Even without a bloodied legendary effect?
---
The video of the leak came out in July
---
Wrong honestly, you shouldn't be doing that much more damage because you wear no armor. The entirety of the effects needs to be scrapped and reworked. What yo'ure proposing is simply Bloodied but without the ability to use any close range weapons. 
---
My idea was that Berserker's take all damage as a bleed that stacks up over time with how much you're being hit for. Congrats, now you can be a naked maniac that takes more than one second to kill and stimpaks remove the bleed effect entirely. 
---
THEN give it bloodied's damage. At least then they burn through stimpaks like a mother fucker if they're going to have that much damage.
---
I believe it is poor project management.  I'm sure they have multiple teams working on bug fixes.  One if those teams is working ahead.  Work on release 22 started before release 21 hit.
---
If release 21 fixed an issue, but release 22 was built on release 20 code, unless they incorporated that fix, it will now popup again.
---
Ideally the PM should be looking for this and QA should be finding it.
---
But that's an outsiders look at it based on my own experiences in project management.
---
The longer you play the more power the game expects you to have.
---
Oh shit I completely disregarded the vault steel. I‚Äôve seen it at the rusty pick but never knew what it was for. So thanks for that! &amp; yeah I definitely think the t65 looks cooler. I‚Äôm going to end up grinding for both. But I might go for the t65 first.
---
Its unreal how bad they are. If it was a different company I'd be surprised but I've learned from experience that they really don't care much about their games having major issues and they don't care if they get fixed or not
---
I wonder how many of them did the Op and just forgot to leave the public tam? I try to always leave the Op team after I escape the instance.
---
I went to the Purveyor and rolled a truckload of 1\* armor pieces to get troubleshooter. So far I managed to get three of such. Having those equipped (-45% damage) made a huge difference in today's ops.
---
He‚Äôs neither my mate or guy, homie
---
Go into vats, back out of vats, go into vats, shoot. I got really good doing this and it hits every time on the first shot.
---
What perks?
---
Holy shit really? I am so gonna get that once I log in.
---
&gt;shared stash between characters
---
All sorts of people with gear mules bellowed out in fear. /s
---
But no, seeing someone with SS/T65 armor means that they put in the time to get it, not just got it gifted by a friend. That specifically is the part I was referencing. Want the best armor in the game? Then you gotta prove you actually want it. I assume that's what Bethesda is going for. I guess it also stops dupers too though.
---
I dont have an extra plan, but i can mod yours. just need to provide the flux
---
That sounds like a lot of fun lol
---
yes.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to solo with very good results so far, but I‚Äôve only had one really great Ops team.  It was on the first day.  Four players in the Burrows, everyone knew where to go and we smoked it in about 5 minutes.  Just today I tried a half dozen servers to get into or start an Op team that was actually trying to do the Op.
---
I tried teaming up today because I wasn‚Äôt 100% confident I could DPS the boss fast enough, even with a gauss mini.  Charging the uplinks alone only leaves you with about 90 seconds to draw out the boss and kill it, and the robot boss is really formidable.  I hedged my bets with a psychotat and vodka, and it worked out.
---
I‚Äôd be happy with someone just standing there to speed up the uplinks.  It would give a little more time to deal with the boss if everything doesn‚Äôt go perfectly.
---
Yes if you have adrenal reaction and nerd rage you do more damage regardless of if your weapon has bloodied or not my fancy pump shotgun two shots the sbq and it doesn‚Äôt have bloodied on it
---
Did you follow the red marquee arrows to the two medical boxes behind the vendors?
---
Here come all the ‚Äúgo post this on a market sub‚Äù people lol
---
If I had them I‚Äôd help you out.
---
Yes, it's lag. A lot of it.
---
Try going to the place before the event triggers, during the countdown. That works for me and my snail ass connection.
---
You are being tested by players/griefers with Taking One for the Team equipped (this is a known thing now) wherein they can kill you, outside of PvP without YOU ever fighting back so long as you are on a team and do not have Pacifist on. ETA: Enabling Pacifist Mode negates their ability to kill you, so...good idea to have on now.
---
Bloodied builds are the fucking reason people want it nerfed, we don't need ANYTHING else doing the same OR MORE. I don't need the Scorchbeast Queen getting hit with a rail cannon from halfway down the field by a naked sniper.
---
Launches missiles at you but has a .44 snub nose on its corpse.
---
the first thing I do when I start a session is join the Build team or start one because just being on the team is worth +1 intelligence. If people join then the longer you play together on the team the stronger your bonds are which can max out to +4 intelligence. The cool part is...you don't have to do shit with them or even acknowledge their existence (except for maybe fast traveling to their camps since thats free.99)
---
It will use stored items first when you build from the CAMP. Worrkshop is always resources, but they come with some
---
I'll try that. I had to switch servers. I went to fast travel back to Drop Site 9, stuck on loading screen.
---
I have to agree with Maunaj. When I used a .50 cal that was the only ammo I picked up. And when I used a one star shotgun I only picked up shotgun shells. I had never picked up any other type except what I was using.
---
What guns are you using? Perhaps they‚Äôre bugged too?
---
I‚Äôm there now if you want to stop by I can make sure to show you where they are, sorry you had trouble finding them!
---
Right, the only points that count for sharing are the Cha points you put in from leveling. Chems, perks (normal or legendary), etc. do not affect what you can share.
---
Well it‚Äôs AA, so anti armor perk of which I forget the name in Perception isn‚Äôt going to help it that much as it gets diminishing returns, but I‚Äôd at least put one point in it, if you have legendary perks, do follow through, bloodied mess in Luck 3x, better criticals in luck, covert operative a couple levels for starting an engagement while crouched, gun fu at least 1, adrenaline at least 1, if you use VATs leveling up concentrated fire is good. Tenderizer in Charisma. And for a slight bonus on the explosion, demolition expert in Intelligence
---
Oh thank goodness I am not the only one who had this issue. I thought I was doing something wrong because it stopped for awhile, but now it comes back every so often.
---
I think they like screwed up the binding or something. I hope this gets resolved soon. It's stupid annoying to have to close out twice before being able to use the map.
---
Well played üòÅ
---
Commando set for sure.
---
Donnie Darko stop attacking my Camp you got the wrong guy
---
I got elder solo using my 2 handed build and just playing hide and sneak around the uplinks. Was able to focus the boss since he had a grenade launcher and I have dense on my chest so literally zero damage taken. 
---
Tesla is no different from other weapons. Get a good bloodied, junkies or AA roll and build around it. Just make sure you‚Äôre not using the grounded mutation.
---
I haven't made a new char to see how this works.    
---
My 2nd char is only level 56 and everything I've run across so far 99% of the time is level 50. A few random 65 and a 100 but that was in higher level areas.
---
Private teams can build on each others camps while public teams cannot. Atom shop items are a big nope as well.
---
Lastly this is my Vats Vampire/Antiarmor commando build.
---
[commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f335fe&amp;d=p02pg2ph2pp2pi2eh2a72ar2an2ao0a04lt2l12l71ld2s00cu2ib4lv2&amp;n=Commando)
---
Strange things happens in post apocalyptic worlds. 
---
I really like fallout 76 but with all these cute cute cute base building nonsense and silly emotes the soul of the real fallout games is gone completely. The world is destroyed. No rules, no laws, eat or get eaten. That‚Äôs the spirit of fallout. Fight for you life for rat meat and dirty water. 
---
There is already an absurdly amount of everything and you can rebuild you base with 2 clicks... so get over it.
---
Release was fun pvp was out of hand if you had sentinel and an expo weapon you were not taking damage add bloodied to that and even the best power armor builds were 1 shot
---
Its always nice to wear a gas mask where the gas can still come in ü§£
---
I was not aware, thanks for posting.  Seems like this should be fixed.
---
When we say passive we mean active without having to equip it. Stuff like gunnut, weapon artisan, fix it good, sciences, and etc mainly are used in camp with crafting. As such it is a minor inconvenience to have to swap whenever you want to craft or repair.
---
And considering the limited usage of those perks it is a pain to swap between them and your combat perks.
---
I'm not 100% on this but I don't as well. I'd rather both my characters rock their shades, hairstyle, and scars than cover them up.
---
And of course I find out that it‚Äôs bugged in Daily Ops and you won‚Äôt get any shotgun shells in return. Bethesda hates me.
---
Possibly.  That would explain why some players get absolutely merked and it‚Äôs mildly annoying to my defensive setup.  I‚Äôve never seen a datamine about it, but the principle is the same.  If you just rely on DR, you‚Äôre going to get lit up.
---
&gt;shit ton of perk coins to be completely useful
---
Hardly. I don't care one bit about the autohack/pick part. Both are already super easy, so taking that time from a few seconds each to 0 is just not worth it.
---
I see you can sell turbo fert, also take other players, so why not the same for them!
---
I am at a loss, when I have done it on public I start a group and it fills quick, if I start it they all join some later than others. If my son still needs it we hop in my private and I run him through it since my son still doesn't quite get grouping etiquette and is one of those mouth breathers into mics.
---
Also if you have a mic it does help even if the others do not, you join a group and ask if doing the ops most respond with emotes or voice reply.
---
Robots are jamming in the tunnels and doors. I had to shoot my way through them.
---
Thank the team, btw, we did it in my first run in 6+ minutes.
---
As far as legendary perks use your best judgment they are for you to pick.
---
Seems overly expensive at the moment but as people do daily OPs I am sure the price will drop drastically over time like the colossus items did.
---
Damn dude, who hurt you?
---
This should be on the market Reddit...
---
But if you are on PC I have one I would trade
---
I do like 20 damage to bosses now heh.
---
Just standard stuff for handmade. Don't waste your time with rifleman. Just stick to commando.
---
Only real change is don't go 3 ranks of Concentrated Fire as it was nerfed for Commando. Just go 1 rank and pick something else for the 2 that would have been spent, like Ground Pounder or some other perk if you need it.
---
Apparently, you're supposed to research and min/max/grind instead of having fun.
---
Wait, what? Even at rank zero this card makes it so you no longer have to equip any lockpick or hacker skills to hack levels 1-3 locks/terminals? If so that's awesome.
---
At a minimum, we shouldn't be able to purchase duplicate bullion plans if they can't be dropped. Bought the ammo machine twice, wanting to drop it for a friend, now it just sits in my stash until judgement day.
---
The Daily Ops award the Sympto-Matic that cures all diseases. Combine that with radiation showers/emitters and you no longer have to farm food or disease cures without using a precious legendary perk slot.
---
Even with first I'd rather avoid wasting resources.. considering I spend a lot of them helping others, I don't want to turn it away to repair my CAMP when I can use it to give a low level a decent gun or add some stuff to his/her camp
---
Have you tried finding a way to not get attacked?
---
Are you on Xbox? Wanna run some ops tomorrow? I‚Äôm still not getting much luck on elder rewards. I got the sympto matic tho tonight ü§ì
---
either rifleman or commando. depending on whether you're going single shot or auto. just google rifle builds and search by most recent.
---
Yeah, until you remember the reload speed of the SAA in Fallout versus how fast it is in RDR2.
---
Last week, I could've swapped a lot of stuff around, but I scrapped nearly all (in hindsight, a bad move) of my perk cards and my unspent levels to build up my legendary perks, so I don't have any leeway, the cards/points I have are those that support a stealth rifleman. Dungeon environments have always been problematic for me (no high ground, short visibility), particularly against high-level mobs. but add in the loss of stealth and multiple opponents spawning in on top of you, and I'm dead. Reminds me of the Wendigo colossus fights. Yep, "daily ops" is going to take the place of "Nuclear Winter" in the role of challenges that I don't do.
---
You can't initiate it back with pacifist, but if your in a workshop you own. Someone can steal it and murder you still. Also if you become wanted you will do no damage to the bounty hunters who come for you.
---
I had joined an ops group, but had to offload scrap/junk items to a vendor. Joined the ops right when they killed the boss... Got credit, awards, and it was completed in the mid-tier. Turned out alright, but I felt a little bad for not contributing.
---
Armor penetration gets fed through the same nonlinear damage reduction equation that DR/ER does, so its returns don't diminish very much. According to the damage calculator, you'll get a 15% damage boost by running tank killer even with anti-armor and a perforating mag, which is somewhat better than three ranks of additive damage perks.
---
You didn't account for the rate of inflation. Turns out it affects barter currency too.   
---
(Also game buffs/nerfs dramatically affect the value of weapons.)
---
So the only way teslas are viable is using a high-level trade? Us trash mobs are just SOL?
---
"builds" and all i see are explosive two shot fixers and gatlings, just with bloodied, junkies, or berserker'sin front of them lmao
---
I don‚Äôt know about that.  Bethesda has certainly allowed their modding community to do the free labor of creating unofficial patches, but I would never say that they don‚Äôt care about their game.  This is really their first time creating a Fallout or Elder Scrolls title that couldn‚Äôt be fixed by the fans.  It‚Äôs a bit hilarious, but this is new territory for them in many ways, and they‚Äôre stumbling through as expected.
---
I‚Äôm guessing they leased some budget servers for launch, not knowing how the game would fare, and either never felt a pressing need to upgrade, their financial situation is tenuous enough to not allow extra overhead, or the guys at the top want to squeeze as much juice out of this little grape as possible before casting it aside.  My guess is option 2 or 3, but it‚Äôs impossible for us plebs to know for sure.
---
Depends on your perks
---
I‚Äôll be on in 10 minutes. Currently stuffing my face.
---
Only true of workshops
---
I usually wait a few minutes and if no one goes, I'll start. Once I've finished, I'll usually server hop or join a casual team.
---
I've got a group I met back in april along with my brother. We always have something to do. More than welcome to come join us! PC, Xbox and PS. https://discord.gg/XZVKaku
---
All of the commando or rifleman perks, depending whether you want full or semi auto. Tank Killer, and if you want to use vats, youll want concentrated fire and at least rank one of gun fu, and possibly one point (or more if you can afford it) into better criticals and critical savvy. If you plan to be sneaky, then youll also want 3 ranks of sneak, or 2 if you have a piece of armor with increased sneak on it. And if you can add in the new legendary perk ‚Äúfollow through‚Äù, that will add a lot of sneak damage as well. And dont forget to put a suppressor on your gun. And since you have explosive on the gun, you can add demolition expert, how ever many levels you can afford. And for extra damage, adrenaline and bloody mess are good choices too.
---
Its not just the rubber banding health. I will two hit an enermy and they stay at 1hp even after I hit them multiple times (I'm not referring to daily ops Resilient enemies either).
---
It seems like it
---
I've seen this advice before. But the idea that everyone has to switch to one or two specific things is lame.
---
I dont want to play with a railway rifle. 
---
...and Im ok if my pistol build is sub-par, cause I think pistols are cool... Im NOT ok if my pistols are UNUSABLE..
---
seems so :) Thanks to ammo factory perk - nowadays its its not too critical. Try to report it on bethesda support portal, maybe its related to this weapon only and they will not find out it without proper report.
---
Just got Emergency Protocols and Calibrated shocks for mine, personally. Gonna keep using it for that sweet lead mining. Still gotta work on Ultracite or T65 armor, but those two mods alone are super nice even if Excavator is one of the worst statted sets.
---
Do you have damage numbers turned on? It helps since you can tell when you've hit them.
---
ME
---
Oh crap I didn‚Äôt even think of that.  That‚Äôs a solid point thanks for the heads up.  That could easily happen by accident!
---
My suggestion was that BERSERKER'S stave off damage while they're berserking. 
---
Rework Berserker's to make all damage they receive a BLEED effect. They don't take spike damage anymore, their health just drains slowly which ramps up over time depending on the damage they are taking. 
---
Now obviously just for ease of use, they should make stimpaks just remove the bleed completely and either then heal, or don't heal and make them use a second stim for a heal. This would be a great offset to giving Berserker gear high damage output comparable to Bloodied. At least people would BUUUUUUUUURN through stimpaks and have to keep makingmore,but it'd be the highest damage build in the game. 
---
If Bethesda would make it more thematically pleasing of a Berserker build, stimpaks stop the bleed, but only heal for 50% efficiency, so Berserker's would be smiliar to Junkies and Bloodied in the sense that they are shoe horned into a perk or two in order for the build to work.
---
yup, read the end of its description! You always have Hacking/Lockpicking 3 with it eqipped!
---
You're welcome
---
Still doesn't change the fact that complaining about receiving multiple copies of some super rare reward that other people would love to get their hands on and have tried their darnedest so far to get, has got to be the biggest example of 'first world problems' I've ever seen on this sub.
---
Alright. Let me know when you‚Äôre on.
---
Just give it time. It'll become pretty common place in a few weeks. Maybe only a couple of hundred caps by then, if that.
---
Yeah, when you get three or four of them in a knot, it doesn't help to pick out which section of the amorphous blob I should be shooting at.  Thanks, though!
---
I did two of these opts today... 1st one didn't die at all (bloodied sneak), but near death a ton, lots of stimpacks. Completed in 6.5mins
---
2nd one was a nightmare, i died a TON. I kept respawning in the hall behind where a dozen bots of all types were all spawning and shooting into the large room at the other team members, so they turn around all hit me at the same time, I die again... and again... and again... -\_-     still managed to do it in under 8 mins... so can't complain.
---
It does suck, but so far with a 3-4 player team, its a walk in the park.
---
One of my favorite guns!
---
Thanks man...done them all :(
---
Thing is, nobody here is a FO76 developer. There are a couple of Beth community managers but most of us are not them. 
---
I dont want to participate in a depressed-game-is-unplayable drum circle with you, so yeah, I'm in the camp that says do some research and play the game more effectively. 
---
If you enjoy that, great. If you don't, just as I dont have to agree with you, you don't have to agree with me.
---
If they aren't willing to upgrade, they don't care. They know this is an issue. Has been for a long time. They are a massive company, they have enough money to solve some of these issues and fix their servers. Greed isn't an excuse, especially when people are still paying them for a busted product. I love the game but if it wasn't on game pass I wouldn't be playing. I refuse to spend money on a game as broken as it is, or I'd have 1st and plenty of atoms bought for nice stuff. But they don't care, so I'm not giving them any of my money
---
It depends on how effective that perk card is.
---
Could it have been in your stash and someone grabbed it from a vendor glitch? I lost a Vampires Faster Fire Rate 90reduced weight Gatling Laser I paid 25k for, and true only thing I could think of was someone grabbed it from my vendor
---
100% disagree I have multiple builds. And I have to say my top 3 are Bloodied, Magic Mike the Shotgunner, and my Undying Vampire Heavygunner.  
---
Straight DPS is stealth commando but it is entirely a glass cannon. One mistake and you die. Eat an extra piece of meat you die. Trip up on a ledge you die.  
---
Straight damage and versatility Magic Mike the shotgunner. Runs Vanguards Sent/Cav staggered scout armor pieces. Everything other than Earl or the SBQ dies in one to 5 shots...everything. I cannot express how overly powerful this build is, and it gets to be full health. The magic part is 33vhc.  
---
Now for the crazy experiment that made the game boring for me is my Marine Armor Vanguards Sent/Cav Power armor Vampires heavy gunner...I can sit on earl and train a horde of windigo spawn by myself and not feel stressed at all. Everything dies very quickly from my VE Gat plasma. And I keep all spawns off of the glass cannon bloodied commandos crouching in the corner so they can bulk the damage. This build outstrips any other build hands down on its ability to survive.  
---
So yes, bloodied is decent for dps and I enjoy the build. But that gap lacks in comparison to the versatility of my other builds.
---
I had an instigating gauss rifle, but in VATS it seemed to have issues, constantly missing the first shot, even when the chance of hitting was 95%.
---
I guess so. I mean it *is* a video game subreddit, you're bound to find plenty of posts like mine lol.
---
doesn't affect my 10mm sub
---
Research yes but it's trivial shit. It really doesn't take much work.
---
You can have a very inefficient build and still hold your own. Don't even need legendaries, though they certainly help.
---
What are your weapons you might use or want to build on?
---
May the Wise Mothman forever turn his gaze away from you forever.
---
what level are your weapons, and are you using perks that up the damage on them?
---
the thing is, it's still way too simple to make an effective Bloodied build, a bunch of perks and effects effortlessly stack with Bloodied it to make it still the best. almost nothing really meshes well with Berserker, and you have to gimp yourself with having absolutely no legendary armor on, so why should it not at base be stronger?
---
Got any Berserkers in there?
---
Marsupial and Healing Factor.  Speed Deamon would be my 3rd to add.
---
I think daily ops are designed to get every build a chance to shine or crash so to speak.  In theory PA with the recharge legendary would make the bots a cake walk.  Resilient for melee etc...well except stealth builds your just fucked on all em.  The only problem I have with the bot DO is maybe they spawn a touch too fast but its nice having one hard one at the same time.  Also remember they are meant as a group activity, they should be pretty hard solo.
---
FO76 photographers are underrated
---
Its hard taking photos during this event. The wendigo spawns crawling all over you, Earle's fearful scream, and keep forgetting to bring a stealth boy. I have a decent photo of Earle right before his fright scream, taken right in front of him. 
---
*note to self- dont forget to grab pics of Imposter Sheepsquatch
---
There is already the shake mechanic in the game for Lode Baring in the Ash Heap. There are a couple of mythologies that claim earthquakes are from when the giant catfish in/under the earth thrashes its tail. Would love to have it sort of announce through the Mire that the monster of Thunder Mountain has been sighted. Keep it a truncated fight that it flees from unless a nuke is dropped (give a finish to event for rewards and XP, but don‚Äôt let it be fully killable for loot unless nuked).
---
I was definitely considering electrical damage. Like have it retreat to the water to heal and need to be shot with a harpoon or hit with explosives to flush it, but if you step foot in the water you trigger a Tesla arc from you to any other nearby players. When it‚Äôs flushed to the shore, they can use the gulper charge mechanic, but super sized, so more like when an orca beaches itself to send waves of water to knock over prey and pull it back underwater. Use flame and energy attacks to keep it on shore where it is vulnerable but able to chomp, tail swipe, and induce poison+bleed damage with fin slashes.
---
I assume its to prevent a way to get more than 4 players into the same Daily Ops Instance. Although I definitely feel it can be handled better than by just kicking you.
---
Two shot is back in, people have done studies on the damage of their B2525 fixer and their TS 2525 fixer, the B2525 literally only did like 10% more damage than the TS 2525, meaning going full health with not even addictions gives you a really good damage lower chance of dying.
---
Okay but why ruin the game for another player?
---
turn on pacifist mode so you cant be baited into pvp when spraying gunfire
---
Oh they can... you see how quick they jumped on the weight bench?
---
Ouch bro, just ouch...
---
My weapons are 25 im 31 but i dont have enough levels yet to have all them perk cards unlocked. Im working towards it
---
Life is easier as a melee build
---
Happened  to me twice now, got screwed both times.
---
you are virtually immune unless you retaliate, so clearly you are being baited by people wandering into your field of fire during the op
---
How much and what type of flux for a set of legs. Also where do i get flux?
---
make some and scrap 'em.
---

Thx
---
As I‚Äôm looking at all the V icons on the map listing the # of items for sale, where do mutation serums slot into?   Meds, misc or another grouping?   Trying to get a quick idea of who to fast travel to when I see items listed in the category that contains these mutation serums.
---
If you want it right now. People are selling it for $2k-$3k. 
---
But honestly just do the daily ops for a few more days and you‚Äôll get it. 
---
Wishing a month the price will drastically go down.
---
Yeah it needs some work most definitely.
---
I believe it does the exact same as auto stim but I may be wrong. I know you can rank it up to heal you when your health drops below 40% but to a high health build it's not really necessary
---
Haha, I actually didn't even get it my buddy did an hooked it up. I've got the best timer each day an only have the 94 stash box an valley signs. I really want the lights next. They are soooo nice!
---
It has the one that turns a normal GP into a flamethrower practically, what you might be seeing is an explosive GP that has it on there.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest that would just make them even easier to use and they‚Äôre already piss easy to use
---
Keep them to scrap next time there's a nuclear winter cosmetic event. Hundreds can level you up enough to unlock rewards
---
Same exact issue. Has been driving me insane.
---
Ah nice! I like stuff to look realistic so just sitting in a tree wouldn't work for me.
---
Have you gotten the 3 TnT keys?
---
I'd say first focus on survive. Dodgy, Ricochet, Serendipity, Fireproof, Born Survivor, Field Surgeon, etc are some of your friends. Any HP boost worth keep handy. You don't need to kill everyone but the boss to complete the op in time.
---
My only problem is when Earle gets gooified, it's hard to find the pile to loot, and you don't have much time to look for it.
---
Secret service is damn good.finish the wastlanders story to have access to it..good investment
---
I think the grape mentats are meant to help cause they highlight enemies
---
I'm not saying it's unplayable. 
---
But it has certainly changed in style. 
---
I won't be on here for long in a 'depressed drum circle'... lol
---
I will either find a groove with the game again, or I'll move on from it and unsub the forum. 
---
Like you say we don't have to agree... if you still find enjoyment in the game then have at it. 
---
But MY last few sessions have been wholly unsatisfying... 
---
...and I find myself here on reddit instead of in Appalachia.
---
A second this motion üòÇü§£
---
What what?!? No only one
---
haven't tested it myself but someone else posted before about getting bounties as they keep unlocking stuff in camps. 
---
So unless they're fibbing yeah. It works. BUT someone could just pick your lock anyway
---
This has been a issue with large amounts of dmg quickly since day one. The servers an engine just can't handle it.
---
Agreed.  The nay sayers on this are ALL arguing that we, who are a bit put out, should play the game exactly like them.  How boring to have to play an MMO exactly the same as everyone else, in order to feel successful.
---
FR isn't needed. You shoot so slow, you never need to reload during an encounter. That one is basically a 2\* gatling.
---
Either 1st or last are fine. Depends on if you're into using vats (you might get a couple extra shots out of it) or could do with the extra carry weight. Whichever is more important to you, pick that.
---
Can you enable exporting/making your own copy? I'd like to make some comparisons for low int builds and see how the xp scales. Not planning on reposting.
---
I had the same problem with a 3 star combat shotty that had a vats modifier it‚Äôs could be the perk because when I switched shottys the problem went away
---
Do you happen to have any piece of armor with blocking prefix (Reduces damage while blocking...)? If so this effect boosts shotguns to really high numbers, and the rubberbanding health occurs most likely because the server doesn't recognize that you are dealing way too much damage.
---
Number 2, number 3 and number 7 I believe are obtainable.
---
Hopping on right now
---
Good to know my shotgun is so good that the game can't handle it, nice
---
Babytears hurt me. Always. Inn every multiplayer game. Everyone paid the price for it so don‚Äôt get mad just because other humans don‚Äôt act like you want. That‚Äôs the fun in multiplayer games. You never know what happens next. Fight for my camp, workshop or my precious junk. I‚Äôm in. Sometimes I lose to the filthy raider and sometimes i win and I‚Äôm the law. Until the next raider comes.  I have that magic blue box. I can‚Äôt lose much at the end of the day.
---
it will get better. you just gotta make sure you want to use the kind of weapons you are specing into.
---
Damn. That sucks man. That‚Äôs why I always favorite the weapons I use.  I only have like 5 of them. So I get the warning
---
5 Violet Flux per leg = 10...i do have enuff though. add me as friend, on now.  Jeremy_c10
---
Oh wow ok! I‚Äôll see which one I have and look up the others. Thanks so much!!
---
I got burrows first day, the mall signs the next day, nothing today but 2star leg junk
---
 PS4 is terrible for me too. I joined 7-8 different ops teams today and not a single one wanted to play any ops mission. Made my own ops team myself and i get 1 person to join in 30min and then they leave because no one else joins. So annoying. Just want to complete elder and be done with it.
---
i came into this thread reading the first few sentences, fully expecting a sarcastic story about how OP the OP is, and how all the changes dont affect him because he is too strong and yall should git gud
---
but it turned out to be a serious one asking people to think critically
---
ngl, a little disappointed i am robbed of entertainment
---
No I mean the perk card you're going to replace Born Survivor for
---
I stay on pacifist but I‚Äôve had a major issue with getting shot in the back at workshops. Like man, whatever, PVP comes with the territory but when I‚Äôm literally only claiming it for SCORE and almost done with the defense event you sneak up behind me and cap my ass? It‚Äôs just soft.
---
What was your psn
---
I‚Äôm lvl 120 and run pa reboot the ammo one and the on that charges fusion cores and the pa ones are very nice
---
This happens with power armor too and I don't think power armor can have that
---
There used to be slap damage when someone attacked you even if you had pacifist on, enough RoF and time and it'll eventually murder you.
---
That was removed a long time ago so attacks do 0 damage to people in pacifist (excluding workshop PVP)
---
Imma guess they never updated the description.
---
I wont be on until about 8hours from now. I appreciate the offer. Ill msg you next time im on if thats ok
---
Just sent the request
---
I always liked the handmade. Not sure if two shot explosive handmade is any good anymore but thats what i was farming for when i stopped playing
---
Man, you are just a big barrel of sunshine. I'll bet you're real fun at parties, huh?
---
"It just works"
---
+karma thanks for coming by, hope you found some good loot!
---
I have been using a vampire increased swing speed 1handed pipe atm. Its pretty decent at tanking
---
I like the world, exploring, scenery... meeting random people in game (not voice chat), seeing their camps,  i love bargain hunting, so I spend a lot of time server hopping and vendor hopping. I recently started flipping stuff to sell. A buddy recently started playing again, so that's been fun. The legendary run was a huge daily reason to play more.
---
Both days we've had robots were like this.  It's good as it's actually a challenge.  Not enough of one to bother getting my troubleshooter armor out of stash, but better than the raiders and mutants which was mostly just sitting around bored with nothing to shoot waiting for a stupid bar to fill up.
---
Ricochet is among the strongest perks for maximum tankiness.  It always works, inside or out of power armor.  Because it's a %chance dodge, it works vs all ranged attacks, which is especially important for robots and legendary enemies that ignore armor.  With fireproof, blocker, ricochet, and lone wanderer, you are amazingly tanky in a full set of power armor.  Add emergency protocols and a vampire's heavy weapon, and you are unkillable and can solo Encryptid.
---
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.   I'm legit pissed I didn't think of that.
---
no, but i had 3 yao guai, over the course of 10 minutes, destroy more of my base than a scorchbeast or anything else ever has. they werent all there at the same time.
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôm going to trade the befr, might just keep the other two and put different paint jobs on them.
---
Wow that's interesting... I'll be careful. So now I have a follow up question lol. Can you change our legendary perks for free? If so do you lose the progress on the card?
---
It's okay, he's left a note in his tent, he's just popped out.
---
.... F76 is definitely crash-prone.  Honestly, **all** Bethesda games are.  They don't have the nickname **Bug**thesda for nothing.  :D
---
Mine are all the same 'cept the Str and Lck ones are replaced with the fire and poison resist while wearing 5 matching pieces of armor
---
Side note but what level do I have to be at to get that many coins to rank up 6 cards haha? I'm only at lvl 419
---
Par for the course with brotherhood.  Use you up then fly slowly away.
---
This is the way
---
Follow Through and Hack and Slash are both duds so far. Follow Through takes too long to take effect, and enemies don't group up enough for Hack and Slash to hit more than one or two. I'm really liking Taking One for the Team and the legendary special perks though.
---
You have to join a group before you go in
---
Incorrect, as normal. If u have the perk, pvp can be forced on you not the other way around man. Damn, u take the perk off and u safe. Learn the game before  you downvote me.
---
It's great that they decided to finally show PA builds some love.
---
From what I read other people saying on a different post was it didn't highlight invisible enemies, I didn't try it though.
---
No idea what level you have to be. I'm lvl 3235 and have 2k+ spare levels to use.
---
Already rank 22 and barely playing beside doing a couple ops and a few minutes of finishing "challenges."  Going to be done at least a month early without even trying.  :(
---
Nah buddy, talk to your ally. I've built my ally in, so they can't move out of "their" area.
---
This is more a Bethesda problem than a player one. Player's going to play and posting here won't get the massive number of casuals that never visit the sub.
---
We need to push Bethesda to fix events so that all loot and XP is handed upon successful completion of event. That way no one misses out.
---
i'll check it out. im scared of mine though. its explosive, and i almost always kill myself with it. it wrecks stuff though.
---
So one thing I didn't understand. If you finish paladin level on your first run, are you screwing yourself out of 2 additional, albeit lower, chances of rare items?
---
Actually the opposite. I had 3 guys come track me down to say that they went to my CAMP an they love it so much. I think they were all friends.
---
i think they fixed that on or before fastnut
---
it costs 1 coin. and no you don't lose progress.
---
You get a buff after you complete the event as well. It said I had zen Mastery lvl 4 which increases hp regen.
---
1 handed pipe? Like a lead pipe?
---
I also wish when time ran out it would just give you the stat screen... ran it up to 10 secs to go while looting ammo... then didnt have time to see what all I got  :/   no reason it can't just show the stats once timer runs out.
---
To be fair, BGS Austin is a moon revolving around the greater Bethesda planet.  I don‚Äôt think F76 has the full weight of Bethesda or Zenimax behind it.  It‚Äôs not like they can throw billions of dollars around and request upgrades at will.
---
I‚Äôm imagining BGS Austin kinda like the Marine corps to the overall US military.  While the USMC perform an important and grueling service, they‚Äôre historically underfunded and among the last to receive state of the art equipment.  I don‚Äôt think F76 is the Marine corps of the franchise, but scrappy and underfunded seems appropriate.  Compared to the resources undoubtedly being funneled towards development of the next Elder Scrolls title and Starfield, F76 probably has a tiny fraction of the budget.
---
I hope that they upgrade to better servers sometime, but when I read the writing on the wall, 76 is and always was a pet project stop-gap to tide over fans during the lull between major releases.  I‚Äôm having a great time even after almost two years, but I just don‚Äôt see 76 as the kind of award winning success that convinces the boss to allocate even more funds towards future triumphs.  It‚Äôs a bit of an experiment even still.
---
Yep but dont think besthesda will understand a.s.a.p.
---
Don't worry, they'll wipe the character when they\['re done the beta.
---
lol
---
Great option still if you can get a two shot explosive, much more viable now as a meta since bloodied got nerfed, though bloodied still does more damage, two shot for some reason right now isn‚Äôt far behind
---
Dude, this is a massive corporation, not some dude getting mugged on the street. When you're that big, you have to accept responsibility on securing your systems. No shareholder is going to care who hacked you, they're gonna be blaming you for letting it happen.
---
I miss how you could burst fire the mini in FO4. There was the initial spin up, but I could let off and sweeze rapidly to conserve ammo.
---
Costs one coin to change and it keeps the progress.
---
And maybe for the event once the "nightstalker" is active have it as the singular marker instead of the instruments. That way anyone still fighting on the other side of the barn will know or have a notification that it is in play.
---
Bummer sponge. I like it.
---
Ahhh, sorry I got stupid
---
Yeah the new perk follow through will instant accept pvp without pacificist
---
Yup.  What a waste of the very limited dev time.
---
Ain't no cure for baby weiner
---
Awesome! Thanks for your help
---
It honestly disappoints me that I cant access photomode in Daily Ops to get a shot w the dead boss for my loading screens
---
Sigh. Don't you think you're being a little obtuse?
---
I don't mean literal victim like poor little Bethesda. Just that they're not the cause of the problem, the duper are. Bethesda could have responded many different ways of course but the course of action they took is directly because of dupers.
---
Well, since you'll probably start getting them legendary you're just lowering your chances of getting a Fixer.  Getting them ON a melee character is a waste too.
---
+karma
---
Nah, don't be like that. I could have been clearer too.
---
I might buy it now, I already have 2000 caps anyways
---
She's a lot more delightful since she hasn't tried to destroy my camp the last few times I've seen her.
---
Now if only Beckett would stop trying to murder random vendors.
---
Chicken coop is available at foundation, ammo converter is available at the vault.
---
AAE is the new meta (sort of), in the sense that it can hold its own when put up against bloodied weapons of the same type.
---
This is because AA is still multiplicative damage. Also, it's not just the bullets that ignore armor, the explosions do as well when you get both these effects on the same weapon. So they synergize amazingly well together.
---
They were probably drinking nuka quantums
---
You can kick people.  I've kicked them right out of the op when they wouldn't get to the damn chopper.
---
I'd assume that would help server stability as well. Less items to load in all at once. Plus the bodies could be removed quicker. Not all at once though, I still like seeing the aftermath. üòÇ
---
I have been seeing this gatling plasma, shoots ballistic ammo, explosive,  and goos enemies.  What is this gun and why am i suddenly seeing so many? 
---
For context,  just started paying.
---
A gamma gun sprayed at your feet outside of PA does +125rads a shotü§ô.
---
Is that it?
---
Its for hardened masses, glowing masses and irradiated blood
---
I would recommend to sticking to one type of weapons such as automatic rifles (commando) non-automatic rifles (rifleman) or heavy weapons (heavy gunner) and maxing our the perks that give them damage also maybe try a low or high health build like bloodied or junkies. If you choose to be a rifleman or commando the sneak peeks in agility can give you 2.5* damage and if heavy gunner build try using power armor perks
---
 ok let's see 7600 Overseer Tickets = 10 atoms. there that should do it
---
Wrong forum =0
---
A full set of Troubleshooter armor will negate 75% of their damage. Adapt and overcome.
---
yes, just the utility items.
---
We got elder tier fairly easily but my god.....there seemed to be an insane amount of bots.
---
I would say more than the Imposter fight by far.
---
It was pretty fun though.
---
They were only invisible until they started shooting lol
---
Yeah, it seems like it. If it hadn‚Äôt been freezing, I‚Äôd have melted the swarms with no trouble using my plasma flamer, but thanks to the effect, I fired one shot at a time at the speed of a hunting rifle. At least my Tesla rifle worked...
---
ppl play berserker ?
---
Oh you can't give karma here? I'm still new to reddit lol I didn't know that was a thing
---
Part of the problem is that it just FEELS artificial. 
---
The world my level 50 exists in is the same world he existed in when he was a lowly level 10 fresh out of the vault... Did he kill ALL the level 10 creatures in ALL of Appalachia? Molerats dont have babies? Every blood eagle is equally skilled? 
---
...Keep the basic concept that your player level HELPS determine creature level, but make it more random... 
---
There should still be the CHANCE to spawn much lower OR much higher enemies...
---
I've had this problem with other games as well so it may be a matter of taste...
---
Well you can still see your aftermath but there be no need to load in the animated model/texture of the rotten corpse pile so you skip a whole step. You're already saving a ton with just that alone.
---
Lame I was hoping for the fireplace
---
Yup
---
Alcohol can be a real trip.
---
Having your host lose connection or gamecrash might also boot you out, randomly.
---
They don't even have to bump into you. Just crossing your field of vision is enough to interrupt the process.
---
So if you're going to use the signal booster make sure to get as close as possible to it. Try to 'zoom in' to the point that the signal booster is the only thing you see.
---
Ah, so similar intent as the Burrows for flux and legendaries.  Thanks for the clarification!
---
I havn't joined an op team yet only casual teams and every team I've joined we all end up doing at least 2 or 3 runs together. I'm honestly not sure if its luck (if it is I hope I don't jinx myself) or if people just rather just have the intellegence boost for more flexability while playing, but naturally just end up doing it.
---
What drives me crazy is the damn random loot. So this scorched is fighting me with an ax...i see the fucking ax. I kill it. Loot the body. And then the loot is a bat....what the fuckkkkk.
---
Gutsies fire bulltets, robobrains are a railway rifle and a tesla rifle and the potrectrons are melee for a army of robots they use very few energy weapons
---
How much gold is the ammo converter
---
auto loot would = game killing lag
---
not saying I wouldn't love it. but ya it would make the game unplayable. and kill ppl with over encumbrance
---
It's my guess that they're reworking all of the events to distribute loot like Daily Ops does.
---
Why on earth would you drop them? They look like fireworks after you throw them off a mountain!
---
What was happening with it? And is that why it's not been working?
---
No, people were doing it during fastnut.
---
Unless someone speaks up and wants to run it again, I assume I joined a temporary party to complete a 5-8 minute task and stay for a minute or so after leaving the area.  I‚Äôll wave goodbye, leave and join an xp group to make space for new players seeking fame and fortune.
---
It would have seemed more appropriate for Daily Ops teams to be temporary and automatically disband after successful completion.  That way players interested in repeating could form a fresh LFG, you‚Äôd be certain that someone is actively looking to run an op if you see one, and there wouldn‚Äôt be inactive Op teams just languishing in the list for hours.
---
That would require some rework of the public team system.  It‚Äôs very possible they didn‚Äôt have time for it on top of everything else, they thought it was a bad idea, it wasn‚Äôt worth the effort, technical limitations prevented it, or they didn‚Äôt think of it.
---
was trying to figure out why she was so far away
---
I did! I am only level 8 so a lot of the meds, food, and water was awesome! Also all the plans there. I have some weapons and armor too although I cant use it for a while lol. Tsym for doing this!
---
Bold of you to assume they get invited to parties.
---
Yezzzzzz the seasonal plastic pumpkins are all over the hallways. In think i left there today with 75 or a 100 plastic.
---
Vats has always seemed pretty useless,I only use it to find enemies in dark areas. Seems pointless to rely on it for anything else. I know it should be a useful tool, especially for crit damage and targeting hard to hit body parts, but it's just too buggy and I'd rather just aim for the head or whatever I'm aiming at myself. Still hope they fix it though, it's ungodly annoying.
---
Use the pleasant valley train station, did it yesterday no problems
---
Don't know,  it doesn't show up for me since I already have it.
---
They seem to have edited their comment in an effort to hide their mistake. Anyone remember what they said?
---
True. I recant my previous statement.
---
Im on xbox and could use all the plans and ammo anyone can spare level 36 still using armor i started with and i only jus got a decent assault rifle
---
Gamertag is GBayAssassin
---
nah sometimes people have to be booted to make room for friends joining
---
just business, nothing personal.
---
They honestly look pretty good, I usually throw mine off a cliff before I leave the session.
---
I have been trying all day to tame a creature for my camp. Is it still possible? All I ever get is "pacify"
---
/shrug i heard it was stopped around then
---
This is what I'm looking for, thank you.
---
Yeah but then you miss out on all the lead pipe and multi functional axes loot. You‚Äôre missing all the fun! /s
---
Liquid courage isn‚Äôt that bad - +6 to luck when set up properly. Tad expensive, though...
---
Because Bloodied does too much damage to th epoint we have issues with events being dominated by one or two Bloodied users, nobody is getting experience or loot on mobs because they can't tag them quick enough. Daily OPs are a fucking joke and if Bethesda cares at all about this claimed "end game" activity and the tag issues, they'll nerf Bloodied's damage, make Berserker have the damage of what Bloodied is NOW because of the offset of being a literal glass cannon, or at the very least give Bloodied more drawbacks. 
---
Problem is that they won't nerf Bloodied because SO MANY END GAME PLAYERS ALL.RUN.BLOODIED. They would be nerfing A HUGE CHUNK of their late agme players, and you saw how people BITCH....AND WHINED....AND MOOOOOOOOOANED with One Wasteland that didn't even DIRECTLY nerf Bloodied, it just make shit a bit harder to die, and they BITCHED.
---
Yes, he said it was because they were ‚Äúmistakenly put in as atom shop items by an employee‚Äù even tho its cuz you buy the plan with bullion, and you cant drop them because of that
---
Saw a vendor with 3 of them for sale at 1k each.
---
They logged off before I could buy one...
---
I build armor and weapon sets and sell them as a "lore set". It's fun creating things for people who want to try out a build on a budget.
---
Gives me something to hunt for and collect since I already have my character build the way I want it.
---
I also look for gear upgrades for my buddies I game with.
---
Same here i feel ur pain
---
That sounds like a lot of swinging, my finger is getting tired
---
i didnt even know that was possible lol
---
lucky me my camp is so shitty that people may think it has already been raided
---
My guess they tried to fix magic again which caused rubberbanding again which they will fix and then cause new magic guns. It is a rinse repeat cycle ad nauseam since December 2018 when they first tried to fix the rubber banding issue which cause mutant's weapons to be magic until they fixed that in March 19.
---
Why do they think I want them??
---
They are much better fireworks than grenades.
---
That's how that was supposed to work.  In practice, not so much.
---
They nerfed a lot of higher damage weapons and released Wasteland One. Essentially any enemy you come across will be your exact level or very close to it. 
---
People are complaining because they had bloodied builds and now enemies don‚Äôt die with one bullet. After leveling up(36 now) I have adapted my build and am not struggling. Just a bunch of whiners.
---
This. Its sometimes impossible to find corpses from recent kills in all this tall ass dark grass all over the place. Need a way to highlight corpses so i can find my kills.
---
New with wastelanders
---
I'm digging it.  When you get a full team it's simple and fun to get Elder.
---
Some of the combos are a real bitch.  Exploding Eagles were fun - invisible ones not so much.  The freezey robots today were leagues more difficult than the super mutants.
---
Here's my shotty/rifle build. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cf545a5&amp;d=sd2so2su2pl2pd2pk2pp2p02ej4c72ic1a72ar2an2lt2sp2as0x30xm2x61x80eh1i12le0li1
---
is she spawning under/inside of the base?
---
The creature has to be a random spawn (there are certain spots around the map that have them), you have be at least twice the creature's level and you need space in your camp. On top of all of that, sometimes it just doesn't work unless you have both sets of the pacifying perks - Wasteland Whisperer and Animal Friend - fully ranked. Once pacified, try running up to the creature. Occasionally there'll be an option then to tame it. The whole system is complicated and stupid.
---
Are you on playstation?
---
People are complaining that it takes slightly more to kill enemies. Everything is still easy, it just requires a couple more cells of brainpower to kill things now.
---
We're not gonna talk about the number of throw away toons I've made to get back responder gear.
---
yea.
---
They meant berry mentats. Dont get the wrong ones.
---
I'm willing to help you, but we are gonna need more people cause the freezing effect is a pain in the ass my psn is XxzgrimCYBORGzxX
---
I‚Äôve had VATS let me hit and kill something even after it moved behind cover, and I‚Äôve also had criticals register but do no damage. Pretty rough out there for a VATS build.
---
That my friend is a legacy and is no longer attainable by any means other than trade.  It is by far one of the top 3 winners of patch 22 making it a hot item overall.   
---
I will say there are many of them in the wild especially on xbox but people normally want something absurd for it even though if I had to guess 1 in 10 people have it. Sometimes you get lucky and you find one for kind of cheap on someone display wall.
---
I think the first Riding Shotgun checkpoint was updated too, the lighting is super bright in there sometimes. Also there‚Äôs more of an actual fort instead of one checkpoint and a train car.
---
It's also cute when the rest of the team joins in the last 2 minutes of the run.  If Captain Lardass and ADHD Lord showed up and helped with the uplinks when they joined the team and we started the run that would have been an Elder run instead of the mid-grade.
---
Free Caps lol.
---
I don't think floater grenades are good enough to be considered bullion items.
---
downgrade them to regular grenades and just have them available to anybody who gets the blueprint and have the blueprint available for caps just like the bow and crossbow blueprints
---
When doing it with friends, usually someone is occupied and it requires others to wait. Try creating your own team, wait for others to join, and then message them to prepare a start time.
---
Found the guy who destroyed the CAMP.
---
RIP
---
a full set of troubleshooters armor makes a huge difference
---
Shotguns not doing damage properly has been a bug since day one.  Sorry :(
---
It's all good, but I was thinking either adrenaline or dodgy, I dont think they'd be that useful at only rank one, but may use legendary agility later down the line.
---
I maintain PVP was the stupidest thing they've messed with regarding this game, and they've messed with a lot of stupid stuff.
---
I'm new to the game at level 24 and just do not have the resources to fight half the fights I want or need to. I've gotten really good at running away. Not at all how I want to play the game. Thankfully I was building a sniper, but even sneak headshots don't do but what looks like 3/8 of their health.
---
Yezzir, for making flux
---
ok spoilers if you don't want to know content in the future &gt;!so Dorsey has run off to go meet the Brotherhood when they arrive at the observatory he is going to get initiated both for the work he did and because the Brotherhood who are arriving took horrific casualties on their way over and they need people who can do the leg work who are not needed for combat roles!&lt;
---
I have two uses for grenades, flushing enemies out from cover, and tossing them over enemies in cover and vats shooting them to explode over their heads. 
---
And that's really only frag grenades, if it wasn't such a cumbersome pain to switch grenade types I'd use plasma too.
---
Debatable. Low leveled players are being punished, as well as certain builds.
---
Thank you for letting me know!  I was super confused as to how I was being attacked while shopping.
---
Not nearly as much as people ask for them lmao, 2 weeks after ACP dropped i already dumped plans on the ground since nobody bought em
---
My trick: Put plasma mine near the enemy spawn point. Be careful, it could kill other players if they're accidentally shoot it.
---

---
My whole favourites wheel cleared. This game mad glitchy.  I‚Äôve lost 2 sets of power armor and the one gun.  So I guess it‚Äôs not that bad for 265 levels lol
---
Sounds like the plastic version of a ffr mirv Fatman to me. üëÄ
---
For whatever reason, joining an ops team doesn't signal that an op is going down. Creating a new ops team is a clear signal of intent.
---
Gauss and bows are traaaash in vats, IDK if it‚Äôs related to them ‚Äúcharging‚Äù or what, but I mostly hip fire/ADS if I‚Äôm using them
---
Ugh that sucks.
---
He got a transmission from some BOS deserter in watoga, asked him to do some daily stuff. Probably died to those robots freezing you when they hit you.
---
The offer is very appreciated my man. But this was a legendary one.  I am on Xbox tho :)
---
Uh, One Violent Night?
---
Dodgy, serendipity, ricochet make this a cake walk. I run a vats bloodied and have yet to fail this up, even solo. Adapt your build for the op. You can't sneak so remove covert op or sneak for dodgy. If you have a min max vats build you should have high luck so you got room for serendipity and ricochet as temporary perks.
---
Also, don't hang about just run to each objective, ignore the enemies in the corridors, they'll come to you when you reach objective.
---
Improvise adapt and over come.
---
No not imo . Its a minimal raise in damage
---
I did the same thing. It‚Äôs people, trust me. I‚Äôve seen them do it like 100 times
---
Oh man that‚Äôs a bummer!! Hopefully you get another soon.
---
everything i need to know... except how to access this new system.
---
had to google a bit before finding the answer. There is a new "Legendary Perks" button on top of your perk card selection screen (NOT the level up screen, the normal one where you assign perk cards)
---
But they did directly cause the duping through their own coding ability. If you build a fence with a hole in it, you can hardly blame the field mice for comin on through. All you can do is bop em on the head and patch that hole. No need to go beyond that and bop all the other field mice too. 
---
They should just make some quests repeatable from your personal terminal that you can only pick one per day to replay.
---
Master Infiltrator is an awesome perk but it doesn't unlock everything, if there is a specific 
---
key needed it can't unlock it.
---
You get a Camo version of it for free in the season but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll bring it back eventually &amp; likely at a small discount
---
Same
---
Don't underestimate the usefulness of a good melee weapon until you hit level 45 or so and get your hands on some decent guns. Think of it this way: you can either struggle now for the perfect build at level 50 or level faster but have to spend levels 50-75 refining your build. I know the later sounds pretty bad, but it's not as bad as being murdered by molerats in your own CAMP.
---
Bloodied explosive.  I probably killed myself with it more than enemies haha
---
My pleasure so glad we were able to help you out!
---
I farmed a lot of ammo in that op after getting elder. That's how it worked lol they became visible after shooting. You can also see them when they are invisible by looking for visible distortions. They also appeared on the compass when they shot, as it made them visible.
---
Thought it was something else to be the male version of a Karen, not Kevin. Could be wrong through. Lol
---
It keeps getting worse...maybe it‚Äôs a sign lol
---
Lol oops
---
Unfortunately, no game is going to last forever.  At this point you've basically "finished" the game. I'd suggest finding another fun game, and come back to FO76 on the next big story update.
---
Okay, that makes sense. I might go with heavy weapons, as those are the most effective for me. Thank you!
---
Currently running full BOS combat armor set with better sneaking/vanguards/Anti Armor. Works perfectly, stealth still holds but when you‚Äôre found you‚Äôll still have all that DR. Trying to figure out if AA handmade with tank killer and perforating mag is better than my furious one. Commando of course.
---
Exactly this, people got used to easy cheesy builds and enemies hit harder.
---
I play in inefficient build basically explo PA. And I can hold my own
---
Its been like that since far before the last patch. Welcome to the club.
---
How does the end work with the boss can you still finish the event if you don't kill it?  I'm a stealth build so it's already tough enough.
---
Lemme say this assets exists. But it's just marked as hidden.
---
Probably Long Distance View issue.
---
You could see whole atlas base finished before
---
I use to barely see them even tho I‚Äôve played since beta and then after the last dupe wave I see them every where. I see almost every person have one. But if you try to trade for it they just laugh at you. So either they duped it, got it from a friend that duped it, paid real money for it, or actually got it back when they where around. But I doubt that many ppl had them back then. Being I thought they were all junk and dropped them back around launch. Little did I know that they wouldn‚Äôt be around and the would be god weapons
---
Gotta kill the boss.
---

T65 unless you have calibrated shocks for ultracite armour. You can buy all the mods for t65 from the vault. Ultracite mods are drops from the queen and scorchbeasts with calibrated being one of the rarest.
---
I think he ‚Äúoverindulged‚Äù on the festivities before reclamation day
---
Same. I'm burning through all of my resources just trying to keep up with the ammo I'm burning through
---
Pfft. Stepping on legos is for clumsy amateurs. 
---
Real clumsy pros? We lose a 4 sided dice in thick, 1970's era plush basement carpet..... Then step on it days later, scream bloody murder, hit the ground and call for your wife in such terror she thinks you got tagged by a snake.
---
No no bro, some non-automatic guns are broken...
---
My main is lvl 305, i have over 1600 hours of experience and playing on 4 different builds to maximise my chances to get rare plans and stuff on Daily Ops. ( PA Bloodied Heavy Gunner, Bloodied Shotgunner, Bloodied Commando and a Bloodied Non-automatic Rifle build ). 
---
My Bloodied Lever Action rifle build (lvl 113) is having some serious issues ( absolutly trash now ) ! So i moved her toward a Bloodied non-automatic Radium build for the time i get my hands on a Bloodied Handmade. A lil better but i go thought my action points like crazy, Gunfu becomes absolutly useless, it takes me near an whole clip to kill a lvl75.
---
I just got a Bloodied Handmade...4 bullets to kill a lvl 75. Completly unbalanced ! I can't imagine how painful it may be for low lvl players. I'm also working on a Pistol build ( lvl 20 approximatively ). I guess i'll figure it out pretty soon. üò®
---
yeah that's what i though :(  i managed to get all the uplinks done, but i couldn't handle the spawn rate.  Thanks
---
I am right next to a scorched megasloth level 75. I am level 169 with 3 ranks of animal friend. No tame option exists
---
Definitely shouldn't join the team unless you're ready then and there. I start as soon as I get a team and it sucks when we don't have a full team on the uplinks and someone hops in last minute. I let it go but I've seen others kick people when they join last minute, so I wouldn't make it a habit (not tryna be a dick I know you didn't do it intentionally, just a heads up)
---
I haven't had much time to play, but I did take my commando out for a test drive. My main, is at level 225, and uses junkies/ ffr handmade. Takes a few more shots. Sneak shots used to do 500+, now doing 100-125, but it's okay. Enemies used to top out at 68, now 100+, but no change in loot (my biggest gripe).
---
Wait.....is this a Fallout game or a Resident Evil game?
---
I went through that with 3 different characters ...... it used to get better at around level 70 .... now I‚Äôm not so sure it will until the balance issues are corrected.
---
Good Luck out there.
---
Bloodied does too much damage for the lack of risk it requires. Bloodied is essentially just free bonus damage if you build it up even half decently, because all perks that are about having low health also jack up resistences. Berserker's is actual high risk and gimps a lot of other stats, so it should be high reward, and it should do more than Bloodied. this isn't really debating if Bloodied is too strong, the main point is Berserker's needs to be above wherever Bloodied may fall
---
yeah I noticed the same too. 2-shot grenade launcher (either M79 or auto) will kill robots and super mutants in one shot. I really love it.
---
When I use VATs I swear I see 4 explosive damage numbers (e.g. 300, 300, 300, 300 - I know it's not the 1-damage "pellet"). I hope it's intended and not a bug ...
---
Those AD&amp;D rogues dropping their caltrops all over the floor...

Fallow through works fantastic on semi auto weapons.

Everything comes back, eventually

See this is the part I don‚Äôt get. Wouldn‚Äôt bloodied add the 80 or 100% extra damage to base damage essentially doubling it?
---
i was powering up the plant as its was making some and was like.....wait....if im powering up the plant and i already am using the new super generator.....
---
The Op teams may get scrapped, just like the old casual team.  It may be that the INT boost team is the only team most want to join, and BGS has to rework the system again for temporary, quest specific pick up groups like many other MMO games have been doing for years and years.
---
It would be nice to open a menu and select to create a group for the Daily Op, Encryptid, Project Paradise, or whatever.  Once the team fills and all players are at the location, a five minute timer starts for the leader to spark things off.  If the event supports more than four players, it appears on the public map with a notification to the rest of the server.  Win or lose, once the quest is over, the team automatically dissolves after 2-3 minutes, or when everyone manually leaves.  If necessary, after completion the quest goes on cooldown for an hour or so.
---
It seems the crux of the grouping problem is finding and targeting players looking to do specific things, and bringing them together.  It would be more complex, but would be interesting to implement regional matchmaking, so players can hop servers to join likeminded players trying to complete specific events.  The small server population is very limiting when it comes to introducing even the slightest bit of complexity into successful task completion.
---
It‚Äôs also possible that the grouping mechanics are the best the devs could do, considering the open, chaotic, free flowing nature of the server environment.  Some events have to be started manually, some randomly appear, some require a nuke launch.  Some are public events, and some aren‚Äôt.  Some are instanced and some aren‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs hard to create a matchmaking system when the event system is a disorganized system of haphazard systems.
---
ALSO why does the new Super Generator not give extra elect. and unsnappalble bottom.....
---
I'd totally understand getting kicked and I totally agree with everything you said. I felt kinda slimy getting awarded for something I didn't earn
---
I have a few legacies that are legit and I traded one of my harpoon legacies (sorry xboxers that is probably my QE25 you have,well a duper version) for BE and JE legacies I didn't have. Like I have a legit IE25 gatling plasma but that BE duped one is much better also have a legit ME90 laser rifle and a ZE90 ulracite gatling laser which I have had dupers that have seen it offer me cash for it.
---
Is this Mr. Gutsy's friend who blows?
---
Shotgunner here. Could I get some more information on the magic mike the shotgunner build? It sounds super interesting!
---
&gt; But they did directly cause the duping through their own coding ability. 
---
As cliche as it is, you just made the "well she made them rape her because of how she chose to dress" argument.
---
Yeah, I think we're done here.
---
Oof, they are so unlucky. Same goes for you though, sorry that happened
---
And everyone said that the brotherhood of steel doesnt have vertibirds, BOY WERE THEY WRONG. Dukem Nukem time
---
I wouldn't knock 1 rank of adrenaline. That buff stacks to something ok even just at 1 rank.
---
She's still trying to clean her filthy ass in the river by Sutton.
---
I believe some people don't bother leaving or changing the objective after they've completed it. It gets annoying so I usually just make my own team and hope people join. Having a team of 3 has been reliable enough to get elder each time.
---
Both?
---
May do I guess, I mainly run into the issue when I use my Plasma Rifle Flamer on too many enemies at once. 
---
It'll only do visual damage then the HP regenerates back up to full with any weapon once the bug starts, 
---
at that point the only way I'm able to actually kill them would be to use VATS.
---
De-Sync of some kind maybe? 
---
Either way it sure makes killing things interesting lmfao

---
They're uncommon, not rare.
---
Like I said not everyone got theirs from duping. But there‚Äôs way more around then there was ppl playing back then. You‚Äôre one of those lucky ones that actually have them and kept them. I should‚Äôve known to keep mine. But back then there was no player trading and I used the carry weight glitch and I had 3k weight on me when they finally patched it. So I never had a build really so I dropped or sold to vendor bots all the guns I thought weren‚Äôt good and I know a bunch Of legacies being I didn‚Äôt know they would be taken out either. But Oh well
---
My stomach is making the rumblies that only hands can satisfy.
---
You should listen to this guy, because you wouldn‚Äôt notice any difference in DR and rad resist if you‚Äôre already using ultracite or a X-01
---
And the strangler heart has a set bonus. It may be just a little more damage per shot, but it‚Äôs still more damage per shot. 
---
I built both sets and the T-65 never leaves my stash.
---
Somehow I manage to hit and kill enemies all the time with machine guns, even if they‚Äôre moving or kinda far away.  I must be the Bobby Fisher of video games.
---
True, we could use some pumpkins, but I think everyone would agree that what we really need is...

Wooooooooaaaaahhhh. How get this? From daily op?
---
Edit: didn‚Äôt read comments below, please ignore this comment.
---
PA. Electric Absorption. Vampire Tesla. Vampire ULG for boss. My health barely gets tickled.
---
Out of curiosity, does the stimpack that activates as a result of born survivor proc the team medic perk card and therefore heals teammates? I am just curious if this combo works.
---
I must say the Daily and Weeklies have been really nice this season, perfect honestly! Keep it up!
---
I believe Beth intention is to build community. I see quite often two player high lvl and low lvl together. 
---
I don't feel that this is fair as the introverted person myself, but I can see the idea in general. 
---
Taking care of each other as the part of the game.
---
Edit: totally forgot the idea. Join events and teams. It helps a lot.
---
fireproof or dense chest mod
---
Yo can you craft me one?
---
It‚Äôs just humidity and condensation.  It just happens to also be raining outside.
---
I mean PerkCoins made it and the whole forum said that it was a terrible system. Often they just push things through..
---
Thats why witch hunting such individual make sense.
---
There was one today where she would not land for 10 minutes and then, when she did, wave after wave of enemies as it seemed she was stuck to the ground.
---
I‚Äôm dieing over FU lol
---
I prefer them just being static art, but I do like regular animated perk cards
---
They're waiting for you to start it.  I figured this out today after getting tired of server hopping with my 2nd character.  Just join the team, start the op, they'll show up 4/5 times.  Great legendary farm at the very least; I see people doing them back to back to back.
---
Right! So much good ones in there
---
I‚Äôve got an instigating auto grenade launcher that I‚Äôm just itching to try out on the heavy PA character I‚Äôm levelling up now. If it doesn‚Äôt one-shot most regular enemies I‚Äôm going to be very upset lol
---
Ah ok mb
---
Hey was this you we kicked? We thought you never left and we were trying to start a new one. I got on the mic and said you have 1 minute to back out or get the boot. I was the team lead and we were running it in like 530 or 445
---
We ran it like 50 times yesterday and anyone staying in it to loot bodies got kicked because we ran it fast enough its not worth it
---
It seems most people aren‚Äôt willing to try and solo it so they sit back and wait for someone to start it first. The last two days I‚Äôve loaded in and started it up myself and the rest of the team has joined in once they realised it started. Maybe try loading in and staying in the ‚Äúlobby‚Äù room, I don‚Äôt think the clock starts until you leave that room?
---
There's nothing blue beamed in this game but you may talk about the Gauss Rifle, The Gauss Shotgun or the Gauss Minigun.
---
Oh yeah I've been wondering where that event went
---
I can't decide who is dumber, the robot or the NPCs who are watching the vault dwellers come up and take pictures of their fusion generators, communication systems, and their leaders, day after day, without batting an eye...
---
Also seeing less glowing meat on mole miners, especially in drops from uranium fever.
---
Sounds like the Gauss Minigun/Shotgun.
---
Endgame weapons you can buy the plans with gold bullion
---
oop i didnt mean u i meant people downvoting me
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm up to lvl 19 with my new alt character and it‚Äôs much harder than it was a few months ago. I found it‚Äôs getting a bit easier now that more weapon options and perks are becoming available, and items have longer durability bars. The mid game will probably be much easier than the early game, which is pretty counterintuitive...
---
Have you sent a bug report and posted on their official forums? I know several people have posted this in this sub... but if no one is reaching out to their official sources it doesn't make as much of a difference.
---
Just noticed this myself. Looks like they're getting things ready for the boss' visit. Hopefully we'll get a new daily quest or something and some more BRC rewards.
---
Only once isn't a big deal, so I wouldn't worry about it. Plus I'm sure most people understand that's usually the situation, not someone intentionally waiting till the end. I really enjoy doing the ops, I know a lot of people think they are too hard or dont like certain mutations but it made the game feel fresh, and most players want to actually do them and don't want to join late anyways.
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue, stoped using vats with it all together
---
I feel that
---
Could be a number of things. Are you sure you have pacifist disabled in your settings? If that setting is on, you won't do any damage to other players. If pacifist is disabled, did you use the "Seek Revenge" option to respawn? If you didn't, that means when you opened fire you wouldn't actually have been doing any damage until the other player accepted the PvP handshake.
---
Or maybe they were chugging Nuka-Cola.
---
Yeah this is a good tip and it works well. The plasma grenades seem to do best and they are the ones I generally keep because they are somewhat okay especially when enemies are grouped. The floater ones are cool ideas but not executed very well.
---
Shut up or it'll get fixed!  Explosives characters only work when Bethesda doesn't know!
---
This is the bane of my gausse rifle existence. I can miss a scorched beast whilst being 1ft away.
---
That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been since BETA. Perhaps it will change one day. 
---
But that day is not today, unfortunately.
---
oh fasho. i love chucking frag grenades! those actually fuck shit up
---
My build's got [Everything But The Kitchen Sink](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aa51aaa&amp;d=x43x63x73x83x93xa3sg2sq0s31sr1sx2s82sy0pd0pk1pl1pg0ph1pi1pp2p00pj0eh1eu0ee2eo2cr0ir2ip2id2ib4i10a72a12a04a32ao0lt2li2ls2l71la2lk0&amp;w=an2ar2&amp;n=The%20Kitchen%20Sink)
---
Yup, I even posted a thread a few nights ago trying to help people with this problem.
---
Lots of them had mainly QOL perks, and It was pretty much ad-nauseum of.. yes those are nice, but if you're a more efficient character you don't need to carry 200 stims and stuff.
---
Just how it is. Yeah, you have to perk into damage. Why wouldn't you? Also, if you're a low health or squishy, yul.. you have to perk into damage mitigation.. again.. why wouldn't you?
---
I dont necessarily blame anyone for this... all the beth Fallouts let you be a God or jack of all trades.. but this is a bit different since it's a semi-MMO. Just not what a lot of people are used to with fallout.
---
I love mine and they still do quite a bit of damage
---
That event just popped up for me today...I‚Äôve played for over two months straight every day and have never seen it...got the outfit which is kinda cool
---
Or the people that keep buying said crappy pictures of the generator and freak show every day as if it's actually good intel. Of course I always just told Davenport I sold them. It's more fun to listen to him get all indignant.
---
I run 1 in Born Survivor, have to remove it when I go Unyielding.  To me a better choice with the the slayer set is Lifesaving.  It kind of works like the Mysterious Savior or whatever perk, but to me luck points are precious.  Or another Troubleshooters; unbelievable the difference with 0 or 4 pieces lol.
---
Beware of trolls.
---
Hmmm. Im going out on a limb here, but i think it may be resistance related. As robots have more ballistic res than mutants, and since AA reacts directly with resistance. Just a thought üí≠
---
Is the pistol build good after the patch? Hell no!
---
No damage. You cannot take the most important perks for damage and vitality, because the perks for pistol damage take away all free dexterity points. Can't build a stealth build. Hell, almost nothing is allowed! The carbine easily takes on the perk for AP regen, reducing incoming damage for AP and adrenaline, and stealthy perks, getting excellent survivability and damage boost. The pistol takes at best edged stealth, pistol damage ... and that's it. Survivability? What survivability?
---
The pistols are now almost completely killed. They can do almost nothing on their own, except farm weak opponents. A machine gun or carbine is still capable of soloing any content! What can pistols do? WHAT? A pistol needs 45 rounds to kill scorched beast!
---
The weight bench is supposed to give a +2 strength bonus for 30 minutes. But if you kept using it after the buff it would give it to you again. There was no limit to how strong you could be. Screw the milk of human kindness, Strong just needed a weight bench. 
---
Another case of: It was a bug that helped the player and Bethesda fixes it immediately. The ones that hurt the players take way longer to fix
---
Which spot do you use for the random encounters? I'll try that, this one spawned at the tree house by Tanagra town
---
Taste the same, too.
---
Can‚Äôt you just repair it?
---
I‚Äôd be in
---
Yeah, always think it's "Long".
---
I don't do well with the robots. Even in pts they would swarm me surround me ... unable to move, unable to escape... I couldn't jump I couldn't do anything and my gun wouldn't fire. Same thing happened today... My first go with the daily ops was simply to get an idea of where everything was. I couldn't see a thing because of all the lasers and crap flying around me and then I was surrounded and held captive for five minutes. I decided to just let them kill me so I could get out of the event. I went back in later, again solo, this time I stayed step ahead of them and just kept firing rounds. I actually completed the event... But yeah, this was bizarre.
---
Oh ok. To me saying they don‚Äôt exist in the lore is very different from saying they haven‚Äôt appeared in previous installments
---
[https://fed76.info/](https://fed76.info/)
---
Firing rate and damage is comparable to a lever action rifle, which doesn't have access to the busted fire damage type, nor any kind of AOE, bows also don't have to reload so you don't have that downtime on your dps either
---
How about the absolute rube/disgusting deviant who pays caps for the photographs?
---
"What you got there?  PICTURES OF CORN?! Heck yeah fam I'll pay for dat"
---
You gotta start it yourself. Go talk to Vinnie. If he says come back switch servers till you see some of the escorts there then you can start the event.
---
My friend and I tried to dou it, and we're caught off guard by the murderous death robots, so we went again with my plasma flamer pistols and 30 pulse grenades. It was honestly amazingly fun. We had a lvl 60 join half the party and enter half way though the first time, he also decided to seek revenge with us. It was a chaotic hellscape and it was great, imo
---
I think I have it: +10% extra damage per mutation (up to a max of +30%) but the statistical negatives for each mutation are increased (say, by 50% across the board). So, for example, Marsupial would have a -6 INT penalty rather than -4, and with 3 perks in Class Freak it would still be -2.
---
XCom players: pathetic
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I would love to take your workshops
---
That's how I roll. I find most times the group will load in once its started. Not all the time though, and those silly geese can just go sit in a pond.
---
Lol that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôve never seen it then!! Thanks for letting me know because I really liked it and will be doing more often now for sure
---
Well, I'm glad to know this wasn't normal. Today was my first chance to try it out and it was just insane. I tried solo and wound up rage quitting out of frustration because I couldn't even get near the objective and was steamrollered by robots. I did it again later with a team mate and we won, but it was a hard fought and expensive victory with repairs.
---
Yea I think it has a cool down time of an hr. But you can switch servers as many times as u want to get it to go again.
---
Yeah np I'll pm you.
---
What weapon type you use ? ( Let me guess...an non-automatic rifle !?)
---
And they make the home in the bass!
---
Dodgy, serendipity and ricochet make it a cake walk with a bloody commando build. Just adapt your build slightly.

Bases are cheap and easy to repair. Not like you have to repair each individual piece or rebuild it. Source: Several open concept bases thanks to my TSE minigun

Alls good bro, I didn‚Äôt think you were talking about me.
---
Sounds great
---
If you're on Playstation I'll gladly build you one at your CAMP!
---
I‚Äôm not into building in this game so I left mine like that after it got nuked. I fixed my workbenches, Brahmin and crops but that‚Äôs all. What‚Äôs funny is every time I spawn into the game, my entire camp falls apart in a loud earth shattering rumble. It also happens to whomever fast travels to my camp according to friends. 
---
It‚Äôs been about a year though so I‚Äôve been considering deleting it all and using the new bunkers once I unlock that new one in the current season.
---
I hardly keep any mines I get, but that would be good. And it might help if I was on coms but I can't use them this late at night.
---
Being an Aussie, I made a quick decision when I started playing to not be a vats build. The lag and/or game engine just simply won't allow consistency. Even melee vats is crazy unreliable.
---
Can not discover Bog Town because in the challenge it's spelled Bogtown. Been an issue since day fucking one.
---
There is only an 80% chance that a rare item will drop.
---
Yes limb damage on melee from world drops is back again. No idea when it will be fixed. 
---
Murmgh is the only place to get melee without limb damage
---
Ok thnx
---
kind of yes... but this is another can of worms.  while i won't shy away from criticizing bethesda and calling them out on stupid or lazy decisions...
---
this is one of the things where... what you're asking for isn't unreasonable, but at the same time, would be more trouble than it might seem.
---
think of static meshes like cardboard boxes.  as long as they're folded the way they're cut and designed to be folded... they look great.  try and say, fold a square box into a rectangle by hand... and it will look extremely messy before it looks nice.
---
"just bending" a dress would be in the same boat.  the mesh isn't meant to bend at those parts, the texture isn't designed to warp at that joint.  sure they could do a pass over all the textures and adjust the meshes so they bend where they need to.  but that's work that wouldn't come out of thin air.  even just extending the skirts would need the same attention, as anywhere they lengthened them the joints would be out of alignment with the character models and again, the textures would end up warped.
---
i'm not against modesty, but at the same time, is it really the top concern among people literally scavving for their next meals and running around in lord humungous style wasteland bondage gear?
---
if enough people ask for it, i'm not going to complain if bethesda helps out.  but i will sit here and make sure ya'll know this is one case where it isn't really an easy or automated fix.  this is something that'd have to be done by hand, entirely on the front end and is 100% not dependent on changing a few lines of code.
---
slight side note.... if you don't give your sophia a bed... she won't sleep in it :-P  i have mine kinda "locked" in.  my camp is a bar/lounge/hotel and she's my bartender.  my actual bar is two of the hardwood bars that came with the pickaxe pilsner mirror, a stove, and her console.  stove is on the sidewall, back wall is clear, bars parallel to the back wall, her console forming the outer edge.
---
she'll spawn all over the place, but will migrate to her console eventually, and then bounce between the stove and the console.  not once in close to 30ish real world playing hours so far with this setup has she done anything else.
---
at my old camp i did kinda the same thing. only with a seedy shed, her console, and a chemistry workbench. 90% of the time she'd bounce between the bench and console (on opposite sides inside the shed) and the remaining 10% she'd wander next door to my log cabin and tinker with a different workbench.  i had that setup for god, maybe 50 or 60 hours and only exceptions were when enemies attacked and she chased after them.
---
Interestingly enough, this is the second day now that I don‚Äôt have a raiders faction quest.
---
First day (9/17) using my main to chase raider reputation, I get no quests.
---
Second day (9/18), the importance of communication pops up.
---
Third day (9/19), no quests again (both are grayed out in the pipboy).
---
Now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs only Roxy that‚Äôs glitched for me.
---
This is more for my own historical tracking at this point or anyone who might be running into the same issue. I plan on continuing to track it to see if I can figure out a pattern.
---
ü§£‚ò†
---
The first one was pretty easy, I had 8 minutes and some seconds so I believe him.
---
It happened to me 3 times, two days ago, on 3 of my 4 characters. Idk if it's a bug or it is just how the rng works in those Daily Ops. But yeah, you may wanna do this activity on multiple characters dude.
---
My friends tell me my camp is grayed and difficult to find on the map , I have a ufo camp , maybe floaters cause this , I don‚Äôt know how it happens
---
Omg that's the perfect song for that situation hahaha
---
As someone who's fairly close with Xilandro, the New Vegas modder who's working on B42 (which formerly included B42 Dual Wield), it's a lot harder to do than it sounds on as a concept.
---
There is no overclocking or boost mechanic. The fusion core generator was broken before, it would shit out fusion cores. If you need them, theres always someone either giving them away or selling them
---
Yo giantpunda Bethesda and their parent company Zenimax are huge corporations and they have the resources to stop cheaters and hackers and sure a hacker can and will come every now and then but I think if you look at what Activision is doing with call of duty and how hard they are cracking down on cheaters why can't Bethesda/Zenimax do the same they have more than enough money to they could hire more people to help stop cheaters or implement a strong anti-cheat
---
It isn‚Äôt as bad as most people are complaining about. For those who are crying, wipe away your tears and get over yourself.
---
What the heck.. that‚Äôs ridiculous.. All the updates that have happened and they don‚Äôt fix a simple spelling error? üòë
---
How does it determine what kind of ammo is on the body if you some have to tag it?

They already have his suit.
---
Junkies is now maybe was a magic gun prefix. I have been saying it for a while but bethesda goes in cycles. First they fix rubberbanding which creates what we now call magic guns, then they fix the magic gun(s) and it brings rubberbanding back sometimes to just a few types of guns sometimes to all guns. They will fix the rubberbanding and we will be back to a new set of magic guns, could be like the early days where it was 1 piece of armor causing it or 1 of the stars on a weapon, could be like how it is today with 7 different magic piece hell they could fix it and make 15 different prefixes magic by mistake.   
---
For those curious to when this all started go back to the december 2018 patch where they fixed rubberbanding then go look at the march 2019 patch where they fixed an "exploit" with mutants. Then just keep reading the patches from there and you see the pattern.   
---
From the sounds of it junkies magic is fixed since there is rubberbanding again, then again the rubberbanding could be a branch from their updating alien blaster and shishkabob and junkies magic is just making it more apparent.   
---
I typed all that out and now thinking I may need to do a full round of testing tomorrow to try and figure out if there is new magic weapons/armor or if magic is still there but there is a new rubberbanding bug.  Personally since I have been using various legacies all week I have not seen any rubberbanding but normie mobs die in 1-2 bullets including the mirelurk queen so the spread magic still exists.
---
There are the exact same number of levels and you will need the exact same number of points to achieve them. Points will be distributed in more abundance than last season.
---
Lvl 1 to 20 is easy if you make throwing knives and use them.
---
20 to 30 the knives start losing their worth but are still a good way to save some ammo.
---
It's a bit rude. It's kind of like pushing a guy sitting beside you on public transportation out of his seat so your friend can sit there instead.
---
im not taking it from other peoples perspectives just mine. seems the op op tse people are prospering
---
Yep I think you're right I'll have to check the settings.....and gather a shit load of Nuka Cola. Thanks.
---
You have to be red (in pvp) to them. It's nowhere near as common now.
---
TIL Athena becomes Android 16 if you help her get a new body
---
Nope. Not agree. If u play other fallout then u should know how to survive in first few level
---
Awesome! Thank you for your help, I guess the key was searching for "sluggish" megasloth. Have a great weekend
---
I swear I picked up like 137 of them the other night in the area around the Halloween house
---
Couldn't hop my way outta that one
---
I‚Äôm not having trouble I‚Äôm a level 20
---
Honestly it feels like it‚Äôs gotten easier, I have everything I need and have been doing daily ops to level up.
---
I die so much more in this game than when it first came out
---
New river gorge resort. Guaranteed bloatly spawns, server hop her to build up a supply.
---
Farm her to get 10 and make a bloatfly syringer then you can turn any enemy into a bloatly up on death.
---
Probably the best uses of instigating would be stealth rifleman or a melee. My wife‚Äôs mule has an instigating super sledge and still one shots basic enemies post patch and I haven‚Äôt tried my rifles since the patch but I had an ie lever that hit like a tank.
---
I didn't have my Pearly Peepers favorited, but I still carried them for Distant Thunder. Guess what got accidentally scrapped?
---
You say points are distributed in more abundance. I played today, and it seems the same. Could you elaborate?
---
It's to make the game more challenging. The purpose of more health on enemies is just that.
---
I'm in a bit of bind myself. I have very little caps, very little Stimpacks (4) and armor is broke on both my legs. I'm trekking through but with i cant even fight anymore lol just run
---
I‚Äôve been just using fallout 1st private worlds and I‚Äôll drop whatever and logout and login with my other characters and pick up the stuff from the private world. My characters All have the same camp location so it‚Äôs easy
---
Glowing meat comes from glowing creatures
---
What level are you? If you say under 50, well your character is fragile and you have crap for equipment. If you say under 100, you build needs reworked and need better equipment. There are things you can do to improve your character. Find a group and work together. This is a multiplayer game. There is strength in numbers.
---
On my main at least, I didn't use a Junkie or Bloodied build. Best as I can describe it, I just had a dakka build by just using more ammo. Last update made enemies a bit spongier, but I'll need to fight a few more Mirelurk Kings and Queens before I figure out if the enemies are more lethal.
---
Mules consuming old duped xmas gifts for caps lol
---
challanging does not mean removing the ability for weapons that should be able to one shot from doing so. that should be saved for legendries and bosses not trash mobs.  
---
That is an annoyance not a challange
---
I mean, you can use levelups to move points instead; that'll ultimately only cost you 5 levels once you've reached level 4 in Legendary Luck(move from luck to agility)
---
I said they will be. There are three bonus points events scheduled for this season so far, as well as presumed extra challenges from time to time.
---
Also don't kick the melee guy for staying at the objective... It's not their fault they're not able to contribute to much more than the timer since everything is getting killed before it gets inside the zone.
---
I‚Äôve had 3 days in a row of getting elder and not getting any rare rewards, I‚Äôd kill for a caged light at this point.

Been there....RIP fissure loot sacrifice
---
Yeah, I don't blame a lot of them either. Going from every prior Bethesda game with limitless storage and a massive personal one to this is a culture shock. We all went through that to some degree or another.
---
Most of these people struggling are food sniper builds for the most part. It worked for the old games, and did kind of ok up until now but now it's just not tenable.
---
That doesn't mean to say that Bethesda shouldn't tweak things. 
---
As fine as I'm managing, things do feel tuned a tad too high in intensity. I'd like the pace to be more varied so you can have some lulls and some really intense moments. Just being intense all the time I can see being tiresome for a lot of casuals that just don't know any better or don't care to change their build and playstyle to suit. Hell, it's a little tiresome for me as is.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why they did it.  No you can‚Äôt one shot everything
---
You‚Äôve heard about the 7 wonders of the world
---
Fallout 4 Dogmeat had a fetch command.  Very helpful for when you dropped your favorite gun and couldn't find it in the weeds.
---
And I"m saying, they simply cannot buff Berserker without nerfing Bloodied FIRST, because Bloodied is not a problem JUST because it's low risk, it's also a problem because everyone and their fucking mother runs around with a bloodied build ONE SHOTTING EVERYTHING. It'd be more manageable if they were one hit from death for real, but even then, bloodied users are hardly ever struck anyway. 
---
We don't need anything right now doing more damage than Bloodied unless Bloodied is nerf. I think Berserker should do more damage than Bloody, but not more than Bloody is doing right now
---
[Misses a 100% shot]
---
Complete a daily op on elder is your best chance.
---
rare reward from daily op, do it in under 8 minutes to get the elder tier and you have about 9% chance.  
---
edit: chance is not 9%, sorry. more like 3%
---
Learn from this mistake and don't do it again. Unless Bethesda changes things in future, you have to live with that mistake.
---
It‚Äôs one of the rare rewards from daily ops. If you‚Äôre on PlayStation I could build you one, I got it today.
---
My man, if you play with the Unyielding armor set and/or don't even have the Suppressor perk card, you'll cry forever. When it comes to dmg/energy resistance...it's fix your build ! The meta is changing in that regard, playing near 300-350 with only Serendipity as defensive perk card may no longer works.
---
And when it comes to the dmg nerf, it looks like non-automatic rifles have some balancing issues. Some are drastically more trash than others. Idk how it looks for pistols, but i'll figure this out pretty soon, i'm about to go work on my Pistol build in a couple of days or so..
---
I'd love this.  Give us something to use them on!
---
You can move the Luck point over from your regular stat to something else, like agility.  You‚Äôll still have luck 15, but you‚Äôll get your Agility one higher.  It will use one of the points you get from levelling though.
---
Male Karen's are theoretically "Keiths".
---
Got it thanks
---
Move the perk points from luck to agility with your next few level ups
---
The best advice I can give anyone is do the main quest. It will give you all the items you need to survive and xp to level up. Explore along the way, but stay on the quest.
---
no it isnt, they made everything take 3 times longer to kill instead of just the higher tier mobs like deathclaws, scorchbeasts, bosses, and starred enemies.making the trash mobs that pose no threat take 3 times longer to kill isnt a challange, its a nuisance. they pose no threat all they do is distract you a little longer.  
---
If you think this is about wanting to one shot bigger enemies you are greatly mistaken.  
---
Enemies like mole miners, bugs, animals. why are these things that are supposedly weak enemies suddenly so resistant to everything. It doesnt make any sense especially not balance wise
---
It‚Äôs counterintuitive from the perspective of the player, but not to the creator.  If players could jump into Daily Ops or a silo and farm endless waves of high level enemies for full xp, lvl 5000 players would be common.  Some players would sit there all day until they either ran out of ammo or Mountain Dew.  It has to be cost prohibitive or deincentivized to save those players from themselves.
---
In a way, it‚Äôs why golf carts, at least older ones, have limiters built into them.  It‚Äôs there to prevent the operator from going too fast, damaging the machine or otherwise creating a dangerous situation in public.  The engine needs to be powerful enough to perform under load, so the limiter only allows the operator a portion of maximum power.
---
The enemies in the silo or daily op need to create challenge, but they cant award the same xp as their outdoor counterparts, or they become more lucrative than the quest itself.  Xp is the limiter to prevent the dirt from becoming more valuable than the ore.  If people are already server hopping the Burrows over and over, or using Radiation Rumble as an xp farm, there is no way you could drag them out of a silo awarding full xp per kill.
---
If that seems stupid to you, imagine every server where no nukes are ever dropped, no events are attended and 80% of the players are in one of three silos fighting each other for scraps on their way to lvl 10,001.  
---
It kinda happened in 2018 and early 2019 at the Whitespring.  Nuke zone enemies used to award massive xp, so 80% of the server spent all their time endlessly shooting hordes of glowing ghouls on repeat.  Players fighting over who could annihilate the ghouls faster and tag the most for loot, for hours on end.  Almost nothing else was happening on the rest of the map.  If you farmed the place long enough, the game would run out of ghouls and start spawning eyebots and protectrons.
---
After months of selling Foundation out to the raiders I finally got the perfect picture of Paige. [This is the face of a man who's really tired of my shit.](https://i.imgur.com/nQne3JI.png) I feel like my talent for causing trouble has finally been appreciated.
---
Davenport: "Wot???"
---
I know, right? Shocking that I would  turn out to be a lying con a hundred times in a row. Surely next time I won't let you down. See you tomorrow, sucker!
---
well just finished in 21 min alone with melee 2hnd, first time doing, annoying freezing as hell, burned 35 s.stim and 1 psychobuff, not worth it, mediocre rewards.
---
So, how would you make it more challenging?
---
Yepp I should mention im level 40, quite far in the pre wastleanders main quest and far in the wasteland main quest. Doing okay with weapons and did okay for a looong time just now I've been in a bit of situation I feel like its gonna take a bit to get back on my feet again lol
---
It wastes more ammo.  You repair a lot more.  Enemies are more spongy. Idk man just saying. Over lvl 500 and it feels harder.  If you disagree then make a new character like I did. It‚Äôs a lot harder
---
Only time i've bailed on a daily ops was when we were in the starting area waiting for the last guy and then a nuke dropped - one person said "back in 5?" and we all thumbs up'd and left to do the SBQ before she got melted.
---
Then went an regrouped for the Daily Op after.
---
Looks like a skin but not in game yet.
---
Typical bethesda. Why m I not surprised...
---
That‚Äôs when it‚Äôs tomahawk time
---
How are players dropping or destroying their guns so often?  I have never managed to do this in a game.  It‚Äôs a weekly complaint on here.
---
first of all they didnt need to make the game more challenging in the first place. But they DID need to buff the health on higher tiered enemies. The challange was already there its just the balance they seem to keep avoiding. "we will balance it, it will be balanced" There were already events and bosses you couldnt solo without a "perfect" build or a team of players.
---
Now it just seems like bethesda is forcing everyone to do co-op on everything.
---
Camo Covert ops under armor from the atom shop.
---
I think cold robots are the worse so far
---
That is a prime example of excellent communication. üëç 
---
Is it too much to ask that i think if ACP popped up while me and Guy #2 were waiting on Guy #3 and i was even on the mic asking him to join, that Guy #3 just leaves the team to do his thing and then join again when he's ready?
---
This made me laugh, its about right though!!
---
Don‚Äôt complain about #3. Because he was on your team, you got 25% XP while he got normal xp. You came out ahead. Less people mean smaller swarms.
---
2 years. Still feels like the game's been out for a month
---
Which one?  I suppose it'd have to do with one of the explodig perks bypassing pacifist mode...
---
FAIR
---
I had it happen 3 times within a week, so I locked all the doors at my camp to keep the assholes out.  They were throwing plasma grenades and using a grenade launcher.
---
uh, its fun?
---
i tend not to waste time adjudicating what others find fun
---
I wasn't wanted/red when it happened at my camp three different times.
---
I just want non auto stealth ambush things to work. I was  pissed this was not a thing  untill i swapped to my 2h tank and then I rage quit after my power armor speced 2h guy just died over and over
---
It's not growing rampant  It is already so badd that it's affects will never go away
---
I promise that you can kill enemies without a legacy gatling plasma.  Or maybe not.
---
Lag.  You look at your pip boy, then exit it and reload your weapon. Drop and reload share the same button.  Boom, 2 shot rifle on the ground in the weeds.
---
Since the last patch launched I disconnect at least once per play session. Usually in the middle of missions that don't have checkpoints because you know, why not?
---
The Queen graciously accepts your offer.
---
The event I was at also seemed to have a constant wave of ememies.
---
i think in a lot of cases it may be a language barrier, people playing on english clients from non english speaking nations
---
they dont understand/get half the words but know how to join a team, and just hit it 
---
i find this a lot with objectives in events too. i play in SE asia so see a lot of SE asia players, and most of them seem to have no clue how to do objectives or even notice them, despite being high level.
---
give us an option to turn them off as a qol setting
---
I see the explanation by Bethesda about damage multiplying calculation.  Seems pretty straight forward.  Now all of my bloodied weapons across the board do about 40% less damage.  Is anyone else having this issue, the comments and conversation have been vague from i jabe read and i was hoping people would have some more insight.  Im hoping there's something im missing because my character is entirely built around bloodied and its feeling pretty worthless right now.  Trying not to delete the game from my hard drive as I type this.....
---
Yeah, I got a two-shot missile launcher (low weight so why not keep it) and I'm surprised at how well it is working now. Finally have a fun way to get rid of all those missiles they award us.
---
Agreed, the fact that so many trash mobs scale up to you is annoying. this isnt a challange its just  nuisance.   
---
Now weapons that SHOULD be able to one hit lower teired mobs dont. While it prevents higher tiered mobs from getting one shot which is good. why they hell is a tick able to take 3 hits from my 3\* super sledge with 50% armor penetration and 40% increased power attack damage. It makes zero sense, it should pancake that bug on the first go.
---
My shotguns are working better in vats. Combat rifles are doing okay close up but a real problem hitting from under 40%... which makes sense. But sniper rifles are unusable in bats now. Even from 10 feet
---
To be fair, a hide like that is gonna shrink once it‚Äôs no longer stretched over gargantuan bones. Even a deer hide shrinks a little during treatment.
---
Loosely related, but I'm not sure if I needed to make a new post. How do I go about using Flux? Sometimes I get it, but I just end up dropping it at the feet of the highest level player that is closest to my camp.
---
Another fair point! I did do the "come hither" emote several times as well but it's a possibility our friend didn't notice it üëç
---
Also, the plans for both Bows are player bound, but the Bows themselves aren‚Äôt oddly enough.
---
So you saw another post about the vendor bug, so you made a new post about the same topic?
---
Glad I could help! Got hit with this myself today, no bueno.
---
I've run it on 4 characters on elder, every day so far and half the time has been no rewards.
---
People make new posts to receive updated infornation.
---
I saw the post when daily ops was first updated. And I'm asking if anyone else has ran into it or did they fix it.. it's not a PSA. It's a question..
---
Next time drop something else right near the edge of the fissure. If you're not too far, your drop bags should combine, then you'll have everything back.
---
Also, you must have a bobby-pin in order to auto-pick locks. I sold all of mine but 2. They will not break, but I carry a spare Incase someone needs one or for moving caps.
---
I used an instigating tesla on them. Modded it so that it is the charged version. Secret is, you don't have to charge it if you aim at the ground. Bounced lightening does fully charged damage on mobs. So doesn't matter if you can't see them, you just aim at the ground and the ricochet does the rest.
---
I actually got to see what the legendary perk "Power Armor Reboot" looks like in action. You definitely need a tough squad for Robot day. I'm level 271 and had to slam stims for a second.
---
Serums are in the Air section.
---
Good to know! Thanks! üòäüëç
---
 "the challenge was already there" you say when moments ago you were complaining about you not being able to one shot enemies anymore. What?
---
I'm not sure where "high level" starts, I would think 300 to get full legendary perks though. Right now my character is 167 and I'm nearly always in my full buttressed T-65 due to enemy uber power now. I run a full heavy build powering a 3-star 2SE armor peircing 50Cal &amp; ultracite rounds. Can't kill a damed thing anymore without a batrillion bullets fired.    
---
I was a proper god of the wasteland, fearign nothing and reveling in the power of max level. It took a long time to get there. Now it's not even worth playing as I'll never feel that way again no matter how much I dump into it.
---
Was the hardened receiver already on the AA gun before you got it by chance?
---
I dont feel that its too intense to be honest.. ive been leveling a new character after one wasteland and I haven't had any trouble.. but its my FIFTH character.. so im quite familiar with how the game works.
---
I definitely think things need some tuning,  and beth has said, and also its kind of obvious, that the change to additive damage will make tuning things going forward much more simple.
---
Let's just see what they do, i guess.
---
My entire advice for anyone playing a new character is to pick a weapon type and stick to it...that seems to be the major problem. People wanting to use a pistol, rifle and shotgun. Youll just suck at all of them.
---
Pick one. We've got five character slots.. and during double XP especially now, I feel like leveling will be a breeze.
---
Welcome to the club!
---
If you don't get it by the time that meat week round 2 comes around, just keep server hopping and spamming grahm at the cookout.
---
Got mine today put it out front near my vendors, becket went in to cure his std's right away.
---
Weird thing happened today, my girl and I did it yesterday and she didn't get a reward, did it today and she got 2. Idk if the system caught up or if there is a chance not to get a reward or the possibility to get 2 instead. I've gotten 1 elder reward each day personally, but hers was a bit off. We play xb1.
---
I‚Äôm not sure... that could be why though
---
Yes please , before the update i was joy the game now is struggling all the way enemies attacking in group at level 50 60  I am level 69 my perk cards are a trash with lots of bugs, tesla Rifle now is trash i was testing it today with two perk cards at full hunting wolf and solo i was doing 180 of damage then i repeat it and then i  was doing 86 of damage didn't know what happening but for me after the update i lose some point to play the game, cards not reflex how i like to play all time now i see lot of players with explosive miniguns and all others wepons are trash for me at level 70 didn't have to much cards to make a build and caped the tree perk, broke rebuild etc.. to make a new one because can't play, now enemies are like hard all time it's just stupid, for me this update change have no cense, for a player level 200 or 300 maybe but for me who just started the game, mm.. not thanks.
---
You would think that the management would be happy that somebody is able to come up with inventive ideas to make their product better and more palatable to more people.
---
 Even if only to get ideas and then have to find a new way to work them instead of doing it exactly as the modder did it.
---
What happened? Camps can get grieved now!?
---
Exactly.. I dont want to put my shops out and having my items taken.
---
I expect nothing from others on my team, I'll let the timer run out and respawn since it still counts as being near the booster.
---
Was it a good sniff ? Also uncle Biden approves.
---
God, I hope not!
---
Gauss rifles are FUBAR when using VATS
---
not being able to one shot everything is fine.  
---
not being able to one shot ANYTHING is not.  
---
i should still be able to pancake a level 60 tick with my 90% RW 50% armor penetrating 40% more power attack super sledge. and i should still be able to pancake other trash enemies with it as well.  
---
Read through again, i am not asking to one shot high tier enemies. I never asked for that. I also never said I didnt welcome a challange. But making the game grinder is not a challange, it is a nuisance.   
---
There are ways to present challanges in the game without making something as weak as a tick not able to be one shot by any of the harder hitting weapons anymore, even mininukes aren't one hitting trash mobs anymore.   
---
Stop trying to take my words out of context and actually think about the situation the game is in rihgt now. after taking  some time to search for other threads like mine im not the only one expirencing this astronomically bad game balance.
---
Every time you return the quest you can hear how prepared he is for disappointment when he asks, "Do you have the photographs I asked for?"
---
They do glitch on knocking a new arrow (reload) a lot.  Especially when you are hit.  And get stuck in VATS when you are hit. And just glitch period, having a massive hinderance on fire rate (all of this since they patched a so called ‚Äúexploit‚Äù that allowed you to fire a bow without drawing it all the way, which made the fire rate ...... playable.
---
It needs a Perk Card for fire rate.  You would be the first archer I have encountered that says otherwise. ....
---
I literally tell him i sold the photos to someone else and the next day forgets everything
---
Most of them have been there since release date. A lot of people say that if you completed them and it didn't mark it, you can send a ticket to bethesda with images of it and they will grant you the atoms, personally, my tickets have just been ignored every time, but worth a try.
---
I can still one shot with a super sledge and higher level means the uranium fever drops are actually level 50, this seems like a case of git gud
---
I'm still one shoting everything trash mobby and 2 shooting almost everything else. Am alone in this? Re-evaluate your build man.
---
[Use the "Scene" spots on this map in the mire and Bog.](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) Specifically at the very top of the map by the sunflower then Cranberry Glade and by Berkeley Springs Station are the most popular. Make sure you have Animal Friend ranked up to 3, have a ranged weapon with either the circle or dot sights for taming some animals from a distance. They must be HALF your current level and must spawn completely alone or you just get the pacify. Some like a Deathclaw, Mirelurk King and Mega Sloth you have to get up close to. You do NOT need to have any free budget to tame. Aim your gun at the animal and you should get a prompt. Once tamed...let them run to your camp alone. They have to travel to it in real time so just go and do something for a bit and they will eventually show. Good Luck! (edit: typos)
---
Glad to hear that, I just sold a two-shot grenade launcher for 1k caps and I hope they're getting their money's worth!
---
I get no rewards a hell of a lot more often that probability would suggest but that‚Äôs the thing about random- it‚Äôs very hard to tell. Weirdly my worst toon is my luckiest. Oh well.
---
Huh.  I run heavy too.  Granted at 20% health.  Maybe you should try a low health build.
---
Dude, I‚Äôm not OP, but if I had the presence of mind to do that, I wouldn‚Äôt be falling into the fissure.
---
Depends on weapon you holding at their time of death.
---
Even if you didn't tag one they'll have your ammo type.
---
And it is random non-ultracite ammo if you are holding melee or heavy core-powered energy weapons.
---
You can do this math yourself, but as an example I'll show you most of it so you have an idea to do the rest.
---
The full legendary run requires 220275 score.
---
Each completed set of daily gives you 2250 score. Each completed weekly set gives you 9500 score. If you do all weeklies and dailies *without* accounting for any bonus score weekends, you will end up with 252,500 score over 10 weeks, or 70 days.
---
The difference is 32,225. This means that by just completing less than 9 weeks of challenges, you will finish the run.
---
Keep in mind, last run was more like 76 days.
---
The road map for the number of expected double score events i think may already be around somewhere. You can use that to calculate how much buffer you have -- that is, how many days of score you can miss and still complete it, after you choose which double score events you will be participating in.
---
Good luck.
---
Event, Leader of the pack x3 legendaries in the one mission / done!
---
thank you. appears to be unavailable right now.
---
You can unequip the card for 1 coin, then equip the card you want.     
---
From what has already been said in other threads, the leveled up card should remain leveled up in your inventory and can be re-equipped later.
---
If your solo, let those 2 destroy the bridge speaker then kill them, then go run to the red car in the parking lot and it will pretty much be non stop ghouls. Most of them will head to the side speaker but there will be the odd one that will try to go to the courtyard so watch out for that. They will come from the parking lot and from that broken fence at the bottom of those stairs.
---
If you use weapons your enemies regularly drop like pipe weapons from scorched it will be easy to keep up with ammo demands, when leveling up its good to have multiple weapons on you and focus on weapons that you can get ammo easily for.
---
You can also put white knight on to prevent armor from breaking as much, and will make armor cheaper to repair.
---
Also get a 2 handed melee weapon like a sledgehammer and that will be good to use even without perks equipped to enhance it since it's base damage is very high.
---
Might want to pick up cannibal perk earlier on so you get some healing done off every scorched and similar enemy types that will refill your health. Save your stim packs for battle and healing limbs.
---
Also sun kissed in endurance will compliment canibal so it will heal some radiation during the day which will reduce downsides to eating flesh since it gives you some rads.
---
Also equip pharma farma in luck to get stims/chems/rad away much easier.
---
If it‚Äôs a bug that benefits the player, fixed immediately. If it‚Äôs a bug that makes you want to die, never fixed.
---
Or, just make a new team, that way you can get people to join who need to do one still, instead of joining an already-made team that has more than likely already finished it
---
I think in this context it matters because I'm only lv 68, getting ruthlessly firebombed by a much higher level that i can't really fight back against
---
In my experience, I can kill something with a semi-auto radium rifle before the damage boost starts applying. It might work for a hunting rifle or lever action, but those aren't very viable after the nerf. And it does nothing for the gauss because it's dead in one shot. The only mileage I'm able to get out of it is against Earl, one the rare occasions when I'm able to drop back into stealth while reloading Final Word.
---
This is literally the exact roll I have and I love it. Not the best roll but it certainly my best gun I have for my commando build. In addition the handmade gets so many good skins
---
Honestly I don't believe it myself I haven't seen any proof just speculation or rumors so I'm a little doubtful if it's true or not
---
What I was getting to is that, if that is the reason why, then that means you have not learned the hardened mod for combat rifle yet (combat rifle mods are fixer mods.)
---
Pretty sure pistols have a perk that does something similar already, it's called Modern Renegade. It is a chance to cripple and hipfire accuracy (smaller reticle). It also got buffed to double its previous percentages, which caps at like 12% i think; not great, not terrible.
---
I don't know about getting more than one rare reward, but I know that there's an 80% chance to get a rare reward from elder tier. But the last three times I havent gotten any on my main
---
I'm in the same boat
---
I got lucky enough to have a quad explosive double barrel and it's crazy strong, I also have an instigating pump that one shots most things
---
Finally I found the one other person in the universe that seems to enjoy the update.
---
It‚Äôs honestly not that bad.  I was in my level 30s and 40s maybe 6 weeks ago and yeah, life kinda sucks until you finally break 50 and can start having some more freedom of choice with your build.  Life wasn‚Äôt easy for low levels before the patch either, lets not forget.  Having to go to, say, Hornwright HQ at level 45 and fight level 65 Robobrains and Assaultrons? That sucked pretty hard too.   Sometimes you have no more caps, are overweight, have broken armor, very little food, and have to just sneak/pray your way past a hive of Floaters.
---
So... Fallout 2nd. Fallout 1st compulsory.
---
More XP for the legendary run 10k repeatable.
---
Tweaking your perks can offset most of it.  I added bloody mess2 and take one for the team, amongst others.
---
It‚Äôs overwhelming and everyone‚Äôs throwing up confused emojis. 
---
It‚Äôs way to much. We need like mini waves not a perpetual wave of more and more.
---
Taking One for the Team is bugged right now - you are automatically open to PvP if you have it equipped, so people have been reporting getting killed randomly and having their bases destroyed because they have that legendary perk on. So be careful with that one.
---
Get a guass shotgun from the foundation reputation. Most other shotguns just underperform after they nerfed the damage fall off a year ago. You have to be within melee range for them to be effective and at that rate might as well use unarmed. That way you don‚Äôt need to constantly make shells.
---
3 fucking times now. Thanks jumpy mouse UI...
---
I fear what doing that quest fresh from the vault will be like now with One Wasteland if I accidently scrap them again.
---
But I will have lost the points levelling the wrong card..
---
About a week ago I found my first 2 shot explosive weapon a black powder pistol of all things.A few minutes later a 2 shot explosive combat shotgun dropped.Those were the first two shot explosive weapons that have dropped for me in nearly 2 years of playing.
---
Yeah mate, that's why I suggested if people at Beth had a consensus that someone in the community was doing such great work, they'd probably hire them or give them a freelance contract.
---
It sounds like from one of the replies that has happened with a modder before.
---
You know it's weird, the day after I posted that I tried a respec as a gunslinger build and already have Modern Renegade 3, just had forgotten, derp
---
There is actually very little difference between Excavator and Ultracite power armor - all power armor has a 7% damage reduction per piece.
---
You sorta lost me a bit
---
If you can explain a little further, that would be great
---
My game has been freezing and having longer load times. It closed out twice today and basically crashes randomly ever since the update. Same with my boyfriend, we have top tier internet so it‚Äôs definitely the servers. We had no issue doing a SBQ though yesterday so I‚Äôm not sure what is up.
---
Noted
---
I was checking cards and it instantly chose it, and levelled it too quick..  I feel utterly foolish but it is too easy to mess up IMO. Regards
---
I‚Äôm melee primary rifle secondary.  I have an instigating DCG one hitting L50 super mutants.  not sure what my  inst. expl combat rifle is doing - dont use it that often.
---
It won't get patched any time soon. It is effectively an exploit, but no one cares. Bethesda has known about this for years and hasn't done anything to fix it.
---
Anyone on ps4 that needs ops hmu, we have been getting sub 5 minutes every day
---
Flamingo Unit, best unit.
---
I agree. The SBQ event feels alot smoother.
---
So lose 5 levels moving 5 points, still a bit painful, as we lose 5 cards and another 10 perk points. I feel so dumb it‚Äôs not even funny...
---
You arent alone despite all the hate you're getting. I wasnt a junkie or bloodied build. But I did run some nice 3\* weapons and maybe a few damage related mods.  
---
Weapons that i have that should be able to one hit low tier enemies dont anymore, not even mininukes one hit low tiered enemies anymore. and people get on my case about complaining about not being able to one hit.  
---
And...? why shouldnt i? I worked hard to be able to do so. the Gauss rifle and Super sledge should still be able to one hit something like a dog, or mole miner. but they dont anymore. not even the mininuke does anymore end even ticks some how manage to survive being vaporized.   
---
I dont mind that high tier enemies like legendaries, deathclaws, mirelurks, and scorcbeasts are able to withstand hard hitting weapons like those. they should be able to anyways. I dont mind a challange, but what I do mind is taking away all my progress to get where I am. and making it grindier to play an otherwise decent game. I cant get back to where I was without being junkies or bloodied. and I have no desire to maintain either.  
---
This was the last nail in the coffin for me and my fears about the one wasteland update were confirmed. It made the scaling just as bad in Fallout as it did in ESO. Both games that could have been decent made completely unenjoyable because now everything is Exactly as powerful as you are.
---
And the lunchboxes, 3 for 100 bouillon
---
This is the correct answer
---
i have a quad explosive double barrel too and i love it it absolutely RIPS thru everything lmao
---
Legendary Perk.
---
Well, if it wasn't in nuke zone and you have 1st there is a trick to get your stuff back.
---
Place a tent close to the fissure with your bag in it. Go away and fast travel back to a tent. After that you will have some time when you are invincible and can survive standing on that green stuff inside fissure.
---
That may also work without 1st with some fissures close by normal fast travel points.
---
I'm using ammosmith + ammo factory + super duper, and super duper is not doubling my results. For instance it says I craft 6 ultracite fusion cores. Super duper procs. I got 8
---
Yes! Next time the screaming eagle rifle comes out, I might have to snag it.
---
Its because some of the bow plans are bought with caps, but yeah its dumb that you can't trade the plans but the bows. Honestly if Bethesda is afraid of cheaters mass duping end game gear just make the gold bullion items tradeable once so it be impossible to dupe and trade em for profit.
---
Probably get ambushed and wake up in cart and ralof helps you escape.
---
What, and have even less of an economy because now I can‚Äôt trade off a plan I won‚Äôt use? No thanks. Tell you what though, Fixer plans really are worth 10k each - the assaultron recall card costs 2500 without perks and charisma, lowest you can get it is 1750 or something like that, and most people are getting them for 2000 or so. If you have to run 6 events for a fixer plan, that‚Äôs 12k in recall card costs.
---
If your on ps4 hmu I can solo it in about 7 minutes you can come for the ride
---
Because it‚Äôs purely cosmetic to discourage people from paying an arm and a leg for it
---
But you do though. The legendary card says +5 attribute and +5 to card equips. My base agility is 7 without the card. 12 with the card and I get +4 from mutations. My agility is currently 16. It should be 11 otherwise.
---
I actually have been waiting awhile for the fourth episode. I gotta say as someone who listens to a few other fallout podcasts your is quite good!
---
Just gotta wait for Beth to sell us atom shop skin for binoculars to  protect em lol.
---
I hate it's face.    
---
Looks like Pinocchio from Shrek.
---
yes, been asking for this for ages
---
This has to be sarcasm
---
I have a bloodied swing speed less power attack damage ski sword.
---
Tea Time event draws ticks over to the water tower pipe. Maybe 8-12 total. But it takes a while.
---
That logging camp and building next door right south of Vault 76 have like 6-7 ticks. They used to be easy, but with One Wasteland, have fun.
---
Even if you have more than 10, as long as its 12 or less, you can just transfer out two points
---
Fellow Cannibal eeeeyyyy!
---
You have a chance to roll one rare reward for each level, up to 3 per day
---
Quad and 2shot are both prefixes, How can you have them both?
---
You can get from 0 to 3 rare rewards every day
---
Found some dude selling jetpack plans for 25 caps
---
Level 40 atm so it'll be like 6 years until I craft them but people are strangely nice in this game
---
buy serums
---
Maybe with the additional double score weekends were still ahead of the deadline?
---
how does one destroy someone else‚Äôs camp?
---
And they can spawn in shit that shouldn‚Äôt exist while Bethesda punish the ones who play legit because they don‚Äôt give two squirts of piss.
---
I heard that it will sometimes spawn if the red nuke zone is still on the mine and then you nuke the queen.
---
That‚Äôs a reference that you don‚Äôt see too often
---
lol you'd get rolled hard
---
It favours slower, harder hitting weapons. Usually. Sometimes it bugs out on auto weapons and the instigating effect can apply to multiple shots.
---
Aahhh that makes sense, thought I was going crazy! Been running that event for weeks to get the BRC Flag plan and thought the west end was different.
---
Im sorry but i enjoy my jetpack as a arm mod, make it a chest mod
---
To add: 
---
I have done some of this and I'm pretty sure the culprit is in my Fallout76prefs.ini

---
Not constructive at all. Just as worst as they are.
---
Yesssss
---
Yup sit on bridge point. You can easily solo it. I find I get bored so I use my scope to shoot the spawns across the pool. Still real easy, but you get more xp since they come running to you.
---
At this point you can move two points from Luck to Agl with your next two level up. That will make your luck what it originally was and will make your Agl two points higher. Yes, you will end up "losing" a total of 10 perk coins due to moving points from luck to Agl over the course of leveling it up all the way, but since you already spent 50 coins in Luck this is the only way to mitigate any losses. Unless you were trying to level Agl beyond 15 this in the long run makes very little difference.
---
Strange, I have a junkies handmade and 5x addictions + full junkie/commando build and I was only doing 10-20 damage per hit. Hmm...I wonder what I‚Äôm doing wrong.
---
Absolutely, if you've started, no matter where you are on the board you'll finish in time as long as you do at least a few a day and as much as you can come time for double weekends.
---
Is Kitty carrying around some chicken, pork, or canned dog food? That would explain why the dogs keep chasing her. Just instruct the dogs to 'sit', give them some food, and they will leave you alone (until the next time that they are hungry)...
---
I‚Äôm not sure tbh, I‚Äôm level 45 on the board atm
---
After the damage and level nerf my shotgun does barely anything and now I need to try and find a new gun (my shotgun isn‚Äôt even that good anyway)
---
Have you ever had a power need that high on 76 yet? All the things that take power use up alot of the budget I'd doubt you could get that many things down to need all that power. Unless your using exploits, I guess but I tend to stay away from that so no idea beyond this.
---
HAHAHAHA flamingo units?
---
Same number of griefers, theres just a new way to kill you, the legendary perk card, taking one for the team, lets them kill you with impunity.
---
OP is big madü§°
---
And I‚Äôll buy it because I‚Äôm full on caps and there aren‚Äôt enough cap sinks.
---
Can someone explain me what they do... All I hear is a sexy moan and a little explosion

---
I use more than 100 and it's real. I would like to see a reactor with at least 200 units of energy. Therefore, I have a perplexity, takes up space as 4 nuclear, but produces as 1.
---
It's really good for farming treasure notes if you are in need of them.
---
Is the only regular event that drops them.
---
I have no luck getting that to work
---
Because ACP only happens once per nuke, and he could easily find another Daily Ops team after it was done. There‚Äôs no reason to prioritize Daily Ops over any other event since you can enter it from anywhere, at anytime, while world events only happen at certain times
---
This is a long shot but if you noticed the flooring on it, it has the holes just like the one in f4 and that made it so it could power up the same floor type as it. This meant that conduits weren't needed cause the floor an walls were already powered. Interior instanced camps is coming in December so maybe the reactor can power up the outside camp from the interior instance.
---
Imo Hardened or Prime.
---
Yep. I went through my build and tried to figure out which perks I wanted the most. I'm almost 200, so I'll unlock another one soon. Grabbed the ammo factory, power sprinter, legendary endurance and far-flung fireworks so far. Debating whether or not the one that recharges fusion cores would be worth it and if it would allow me to drop power user, or at least take a reduced rank. The perk that revives you in power armor would also let me change my torso mod. Or the Infiltrator perk for quality of life.
---
I've been enjoying it, and I have played since beta
---
That‚Äôs because of the few people who still have legit presents - I had 1000 legit presents even right up to Dupelanders I was keeping for scrip and the like. I don‚Äôt have my original 1000 legit ones anymore but I‚Äôve traded for and bought with caps more presents for emergencies like seeing a god roll in a vendor for 30k caps.
---
You used to be able to change a doorway to wall and vice versa... allowing some neat stuff with hidden electrical wiring (embedded in the wall) or walls that cover a foundation block. I used both entirely for looks not double walls, so it sucked losing yet another avenue of creativity.

---
What!? How are you so fast?
---
I'm on 19 and have done all weeklies and dailies.
---
Yes. Invest in Tormentor  and commando perks. Antiarmor might be better than bloodied today. I have both (it is my favourite weapon) and will test it tomorrow.
---
You do though. I literally just made a new character, used the legendary perk and my carry weight increased by 5. My HP increased by 5. And my AP increased with agility.
---
I've found that if I miss my first 90%+ shot in vats with my shotgun, I have to get out of vats and re-target to have even a chance to hit.  
---
And shotgun damage out of vats is still worthless. Makes camouflage enemies in daily ops especially infuriating.
---
I have a bloodied combat shotgun it still one or two shots enemies I reserve my gauss two shot shotgun for large enemies it can one shot high level enemies in VATS hip fire it‚Äôs ok but using VATS it‚Äôs insane.
---
Thank you
---
Just good marketing mate. üòÉ
---
I did a lot of XP farming with lunchboxes and XP buffs
---
Nuka Cola Quantums and the Cola Nut perk are a wonderful combination in situations like thatZ
---
Tbh unless I‚Äôm missing something the special boosts are the most beneficial. Along with the ammo one and follow through with me. The exploding ones could be fun, haven‚Äôt used one tbh.
---
As a raider, this is something I‚Äôve been wanting for a long time.
---
I've done the maths and one guy also did them with a graphic, you can only miss 14 days of score approx. to finish the season on time (of course not considering if they add double score).
---
My favourite one so far is the freezing robots - I found that one piss easy. I figured out why my BE handmade was literally a pea shooter and with absolutely no changes to anything at all, I went from 3 mags to 6 bullets on most things, but trash mobs still take no less than 3 rounds and that makes me sad. Resilience on the other hand is the bullshittiest bullshit I‚Äôve ever laid eyes on.
---
I take that back some of the others are good depending on playstyle
---
Like rubes on the midway. Thanks bud! You're awesome today!
---
Fissure Prime area should have enough to make a decent amount of flourescent. Can't remember if Whitesprings has or has enough for flourescent.
---
Yes you can. Equipment caps at level 45 and 50. At 68, you can use all the same things they are.
---
If you're solo, 100%. But i think if you're on a team that's actively doing an op and telling you they need your help, then I think your only 2 reasonable choices are to 1. Help the team you joined to complete the objective you joined or 2. Leave the team &amp; come back when you're ready so that way they're not wondering why you're not joining &amp; leaving them hanging
---
At the end of the day, it worked out ok for me anyway. We cut it really close, which is why i was frustrated at first, but ultimately still made elder. All good!
---
Edit, add in: I think it boils down to team etiquette and i think a lot of daily ops teams expect their team members to actually do what they joined to do. That's not really the case with any of the other public teams

My mutants three star combat shotgun fully modified with drum magazine it‚Äôs a magic  shotgun I have a mutation (Permanent) so its even better two - one  shots everything in vats

Holy shit dude what do you have at your camp? I don't think I've seen one yet with that much power consumption, you've got me super curious. What platform you on? If it's ps4 I might need to swing by some time and have a looksie if that's cool.
---
I think I can add jack o lantern pumpkins to your camp if you're on xbone - they were rewards from mischief night event last year.
---
Going to put another into the mix, powerful automatic
---
Otherwise I'd choose hardened if I was non auto
---
I keep coming back because although my ‚Äúreward is forfeit‚Äù, it is not. Shhhh, don‚Äôt tell him.
---
Absolutely think they should make the levels of the enemies fluctuate a little bit. It doesn't make sense that all the mongrels attacking me bite with the same strength.
---
For me it‚Äôs the bitches with Frog Legs, grenade launchers and .50 cals that VATS grenades after throwing them at you.
---
They didnt test it before and first users says they can boost strange as much as they do lifting. So it will not work until they fix it
---
I couldn‚Äôt find a lot around prime, and it always expires before I can get enough

Whitesprings has much more fluorescent flux than Fissure Prime.  Take a look at the map for it:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw\_fluorescent\_flux](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_fluorescent_flux)
---
It looks like the best place may be west of Grafton Dam, but I don't know how many enemies you'd find for all the stabilizing ingredients. (like high radiation fluids).
---
Ah yeah forgot how thirsty(pun intended) they were.
---
I love my shotgun tho. It is Junkies double barrel exp/250 max lvl. I can kill with one shot or two to strong enemies
---
Tanks are good against your typical griefer, but occasionally you get that special griefer who‚Äôs got the gear to do it properly. Those ones need a stealth boy and my ass/sent armor to deal with because they‚Äôve got the same shit.
---
Wicked, I‚Äôll try to get a nuke there but It‚Äôll be a task to ty and get it
---
I won‚Äôt lie, the art team is amazing at body horror
---
I haven't seen that.  In fact, last session I played, I got zeroed by a mob of Feral Ghouls ranging 5-8lvl over me.  I only have T51b (no combat mods), no meta build,, and had my shotgun.  It was close a couple times, needed to stim, but I survived and jumped a level and a half.  
---
Maybe you need to assess your combat style.
---
The deactivated it because people could repeatably use it for boosts. No ETA on fix
---
Just put them for sale for 100 caps each in your vendor and it's easy money

The reactor has vault type flooring right? On the community roadmap it says ‚Äúinstanced camps‚Äù or whatever right next to a picture of someone doing a photo mode pose while in the overseer window of a vault. Even though I doubt the servers could handle that it would be sick if we could have our own vault
---
Awww thanks man
---
Thanks bro
---
Something to do with the taking one for the team legendary perk, idk exactly how it works though
---
Do you know if explosive Tesla‚Äôs chain damage too?
---
You definitely didn‚Äôt get it. Either you‚Äôre mistaken or it‚Äôs a hacked in weapon
---
I‚Äôm a shotgun build with Gauss shotgun as well.  Max perk the shotgunner, max out all the VATS perks, roll until you get a 2 or 3 star unyielding....you‚Äôll be doing 400+ damage with the gauss shotgun with great critical damage.  Mod the shotgun with range attachments and it basically operates like a rifle.  Far and away my favorite weapon build.
---
Exactly! Some variation would feel much more dynamic. I am absolutely happy with the level matching overall, but yeah, the variation should be there too.
---
I was gonna say that stepping on a d4 is way more painful than Lego. A metal d4 in particular is nasty.
---
Just solo it. üëç

Yea since the update you have to stand still for the shots to hit a good amount well from what I noticed I used to jump around like a maniac and stuff an it doesn't work as good now üòÇüëå
---
Yeah today was the first time I‚Äôve gotten genuinely pissed at Daily Ops. For me I eventually got stuck in a corner because I was getting spammed and froze and I couldn‚Äôt do anything
---
Do you mean the communist salute? Because I had it and now it's gone and I'm confused
---
Its because of the changes and how unarmed works , we used to stack everything and because the changes count as additive it eventually stops adding damage.  So you can drop a perk or not eat as much food or take off some unyielding because it won't make a difference anymore.
---
lol, what?
---
‚Ä¢ You deserve it, if you're kept logged in on a public device and your password is 'passw0rd'
---
‚Ä¢ You deserve it, if you keep the back door open and store your valuables for everyone to see from the outside
---
‚Ä¢ You deserve it, if you show no respect, love or sympathy for your significant other and don't listen to their needs.
---
So yeah, in this case the 'victim' is to blame...
---
May everytime he sits down to play 76 , he sits on his nuts . May he also get stickdrift on all his controllers .

I'm imagining them chucking ticks and mole rats all over the place and I'm horrified and amused at the same time.
---
While you're at it can you tell them about the ultracite laser pistol/Rifle too lol
---
Thats without any reward from the xp farming?
---
I buy up any plastic I see for 1 cap.  Useful for crafting energy ammo and bulking.
---
Idk man I‚Äôm not having much trouble with them. I mean ya an assaultron or sentry is going to hit hard, but it‚Äôs still like 1 clip for assault and maybe 3 for a sentry. But I‚Äôm not really spec‚Äôd for a build. I never use builds in my main play through and I‚Äôve only made my one character that I‚Äôve been rocking since beta (I‚Äôm only now level 90 though so...ya life) I carry a plasma Gatling, a dragon, 15% robot damage assault rifle, two shot western revolver, combat shotgun also 15%damage but to ghouls, a gutter assaultron blade, Yankee Doodle, and Gausse rifle. I do all right though, rarely die, never run into too much of a problem wherever I go, though once or twice I ran into a mob and got taken down ngl lol.
---
Ur welcome
---
did you figure it out?
---
Aren't all laser weapons lacking currently?
---
They are but the ultracite laser just seems dead
---
I never had any interest in this because I don't care about useless cosmetics. I some how stumbled into rank 41 last season but whatever.
---
I'm glad the weight bench is at a very low rank as it's the only thing I want as a melee character.
---
Yes! Because 100 extra score didn't really matter unless you farm A LOT XP. And without the double score if Beth put some of them.
---
this is why people hate hardcore gamers. you people think youre special for wasting your life obsessing over Peak Performance(tm) in a video game. jesus how embarrassing. get another hobby.
---
Nah.  It‚Äôs not pay to win it‚Äôs getting a loadout option switch like it used to be in Classic Wow, with Double Spec.  Plus it would help me since I spent all my coins on melee and it‚Äôs nerfed to hell
---
I feel ya, but I'm sticking with mine for now.
---
That was so good and works so well as a trailer intriguing the viewer without giving much away of what‚Äôs to come.
---
Honestly I did it in a group of four and I think I was the only one who didn't go down at least once. Four leaf clover + medic gauss shotty + team medic + auto-stim/ life saving armor kept me up but the others kept going out of my LOS.
---
Between the freezing effect, the amount of mobs and it being in Vault 94 that still feels very confusing to me, I'm surprised we made Elder.
---
Everyone got a rare reward except for me. Love that, thanks Todd.
---
It only counts the ones you have done when in the steam launcher. So I finished the achievement at about 80 hacked terminals.
---
I'm enjoying it but think all the QoL perks need there own section or legendary perk. I'm a strength  build and I used to just be all about carry weight now i need my damage perks on. So if they could make some changes to weight in the game is be happy üòÅ
---
&gt; Theres a tinker's bench at crater without going into the loading screen
---
Yes, it is in the Gun Shop I mentioned in the OP :p
---
Sorry for not being clearer that Gun Shop is in Crater.
---
Well I‚Äôve also done all of my challenges too and when I use all my XP buffs it is over 1k XP per super mutant
---
Thanks for getting that song stuck in my head...
---
Thanks
---
I didn‚Äôt think it was possibly to get under 8 minutes due to the time it takes to do the uplinks solo at 1x.
---
Even if you run directly there from repair and stay next to it the entire time without dying.
---
Pretty sure you need 2 for elder unless you are teleporting around the map lol
---
Why are you all playing with pacifist off ?
---
This Games PvP is broken trash, no reason for it. 
---
I never turned it off since survival got killed.
---
I just took the first rank of Gun-Fu, and once you miss that initial shot, I find that almost every shot hits afterwards as long as you don't leave VATs. Gun-Fu auto-switches targets so you can just blam blam blam until everything's dead, if you have the AP. I'm reasonably satisfied with this for now, but I definitely want them to fix that initial whiff.
---
You PC?
---
Oooo, interesting - thanks! :)
---
join public team and follow around higher level players.
---
From browsing the sub some people say there will be at least 3 bonus score events. Either way I'll be fine i can make space for 5 minutes a day.
---
I never liked going to hunt for it so I just vendor hopped for a bit until I found people selling it. I could probably help you out with some? What specific type do you need and how many?
---
Um no I Just looked in my old math book and that is h ow it is supposed to look
---
I've heard its somewhere around 1750 bullion which is kinda crazy because its exchange rates are terrible .
---
One of the best combos u can get. I play rifleman with one of these and its nuts, everything goes down with less than 5 shots.
---
Its been awhile so I may be getting it mixed up with one of the others. Its either the purple flowers that are normally bunched up together mainly in bushes around trees, the red moss (not sure what it normally is) in the water or the mushrooms(?)in the grove.
---
Have you done daily ops?  The sheer amount of gutsies and their armour piercing damage is crazy.  The lvl 75 assaultrons in the nuke silos are even worse.  Robots in general just seem to be scaled way higher than the other mobs now.
---
So yeh I get it is additive bit I don't have armour buffs or anything the base damage doesn't change. Like other weapons I change the perk I can see change in damage. So what unarmed aren't buffed at all now?
---
TSE is finally prepared to make it‚Äôs comback.
---
TSE and I have been waiting
---
White springs and use green thumb perk
---
Yeah man exactly same, my Bloodied Lever Action rifle build got destroyed ! The time to kill is rediculous, i just can't use Gun fu ! I'm absolutly unefficient in the Colosal Problem event now. I had to switch to a Bloodied Non-automatic Handmade build, no joke. This is crazy lol wtf !?
---
I don't know, I went into daily ops with two randoms tonight, bloodied in full uny ss, blocker, evasive, serendipity and I never risked dying. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Get Grounded mutation as a start maybe?
---
I'm convinced the boss for todays op has a damage cap on it too, I run a melee PA build and i was one shotting everything in the op but the boss was essentially taking chip damage.
---
They haven't addressed it, don't think I've seen them even respond on any topics about it.
---
Don‚Äôt limit it to pistols, anything one handed should be dual wielded, just remove ADSing and reduced weight for offhand melee. Probably wouldn‚Äôt be busted either since Skyrim had dual wielding and lbr it won‚Äôt be as good as bloodied builds
---
Yeah, I'm a bloodied commando fully spec'd into it and I can't find any situation where a 10mm smg is better than any other commando weapon. Doesn't fit to any build or playstyle.
---
You want it for long ranges? Good luck trying to keep the target on sight lol. You are going to struggle even with targets that are only 5 feet away thanks to its massive recoil.
---
Then maybe for close quarter situations? The lack of suppressors on this gun makes it useless for stealth/close quarters. You won't last more than 5 seconds.
---
And what if I use VATS to make it more accurate? VATS is not even an option with this gun. Like the recoil, the AP usage on this gun is insane. You are gonna run out of AP before you can even do any damage.
---
Before the patch it was at least fun to use. Its fast time to kill made it a great choice for events/farming, but now is just terrible.
---
Idk I‚Äôm a run and gun type I never stay still long so maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not noticing? Especially with assaultrons, gutsy though when they get done firing have a small window where they don‚Äôt move or attack that‚Äôs when you nail em hard and then move again. Other than that idk. It‚Äôs too crazy when there‚Äôs a mob of them lol. Crossfire is probably the key I know that, unfortunately I run solo 9/10 so... ya I‚Äôd suggest crewing up for it?
---
You can't go wrong with the special ones, so many beneficial perks you can add to your build.
---
Sure didn't fix the durability on them
---
I feel you, I FEEL YOU. And now I'm even more pissed off because I just switched to an instigating explosive lever, perk cards still all off, and it's literally the same results.
---
Well mine gets something stupid like 13 damage i don't know why it wouldn't be adding anything. Is you gauntlet really low level? Maybe the damage is so low that adding 20% doesn't increase it but I'd say that's highly unlikely.
---
i am using a investigating extra hit chance combat shotgun, before the nerf it one shot everything but now i have to shoot them in their head
---
Bethesda hamfisted the rebalance, they did part one and released it making us all test it, they should have kept it on PTS to adjust and balance the new metric.  .
---
I run energy weapons so grounded is a no-go.  Besides, it's mainly the gutsy's ballistic attack that goes through armour.  The assaultrons were also a bit more spammy with their death beam of death than usual.  I would like to have evasive or dodgy but agility perks are already used up.  Pretty optimised pistol build apart from that though, no other enemies give me trouble apart from robots.
---
Spray n Pray was shit compared to the kiloton radium rifle though. Jokes on that though. Now both guns suck in 76.
---
I love the experience boost from events and ops teams. A couple of lunch boxes and it really starts to add up. Legendary perks and the exp boost from one wasteland has me looking to add levels. Since 22 came out I think I've gone from 146 to 158. Earle and radiation rumble are crazy.
---
I don't really play MMOs so that hadn't even occured to me that honestly would be really nice.
---
Yeh a guy gave me like 50 large gifts and you know what the plans in those are ridiculous there was like 6 radroach mounted heads at my camp the other day lmaoo, I think that's what ur seeing
---
Do you use first or third person? Haven't had that glitch happen in first person, even vats usually works for me
---
I'm usually a heavy weapons user, and in third person I get staggered almost constantly while firing, and run into reload bugs much more often than I do in first person
---
Bobby pins are so easy to obtain why the hell would you waste a perk on it?
---
Why do you want unbreakable bobby-pins when one of the legendary perks auto-unlocks/hacks for you?
---
I didn't think about the silo boost. Now I may level it up - I hadn't intended to.
---
Oh no man, v.a.t.s builds on non-automatic rifles got completly annihilated. The only viable non-automatic rifle seems to be the Handmade.
---
Idk who the hell downvoted me there but jesus, explain why i'm wrong at least guys, help the damn community. Stop downvoting Bloodied build users, wtf lol !?
---
So stupid, disappointing, and such a Bethesda thing.  Todd should feel ashamed.
---
So its not just me...
---
Man, I wish.
---
I had a play around with my junkies commando yesterday and to be honest I didn't find the build too badly affected.
---
When it comes to your special points it is a case of finding the right addictions. Then you need to find the right under armour.to boosts a couple of your required stats.
---
Pretty sure that's not true because I've literally done it.  It take like 2 minutes for each beacon, which leaves 4 minutes for everything else.  Maybe I'll record myself doing one.
---
It‚Äôs a hard choice, freeze or the bash one. Robot hands down tho.
---
Awesome! THank you! I'll try it!
---
Does it? Last I knew it was just below Bloodied, which runs at 19% hp. Seems reasonable.
---
I posted in a comment a few days ago, with a Gauss Rifle I missed **30** 95% VATS shots in a row when testing it because of missing so many VATS shots.
---
I have some Automatic Rifles where the first burst will miss every 95% shot but if you fire one bullet, release the trigger, then fire again, that first bullet will miss but the rest will hit.
---
Yet I have other guns which work perfectly fine.
---
I hope it doesn't get downvoted too much, because I really want Bethesda to see it's not just me.
---
? I thought the ESO community generally was very happy with the new type of scaling, I've only read good things about it
---
Also yes you do need high level gear if you're high level lol, I don't think you understand how it works 
---
There's a lot I think you're confused about actually lol
---
These are some interesting ideas. I'm digging the direction you're taking this.
---
The weapon balance is shit, but the critter scaling is outstanding.  I am getting solid XP and level appropriate legendaries everywhere.  Adapt and improve.
---
I‚Äôm rocking a furious Gauss Shotgun, I don‚Äôt remember the other legendary perks on it but it gets the job done. I don‚Äôt even hang any shotgun perks on, it‚Äôs just a good back pocket gun for when things start swarming
---
The guitarist from Guns N' Earles!
---
Hm what now? There‚Äôs a new event?
---
Good to know, thanks for the info!
---
Have had this happen quite a bit of times with events. Some times it's just server lag and a delay from when you actually complete the quest and get the rewards. Have had rewards pop about a minute after or even when fast travelling to another spot in the map.
---
nope all level 50, tried it with the mole miner, death claw and "gauntlet" from the new updates. it's sitting at like 210? used to jump to 250+ before now just base damage.
---
The real question is why does Bethesda still have a perk card in game whose only purpose is to help them do this?
---
That's not new afaik. When I swapped to commando I noticed little to no difference in damage from my lever action. This was pre patch 22 by quite a bit.
---
Class Freak makes most mutations worthy it no matter what in my opinion, and I do play with a gauss shotgun from time to time (kinda dislike it tho...).
---
Dodgy I can't really recommend, AP killer... üò±
---
You can always change your perks a bit when you know it's gonna be robots, or maybe even get some troubleshooter armor? üòä
---
I played for over an hour stuck in it. I cleared bogtown and claimed it, and killed the mongrels and scorchbeasts that came to take it from me. I fired my gun... a lot.
---
What buffs are you running??
---
Probably not, since they've never explained what S.C.O.R.E. means.
---
Ohh good idea. I didn't try that.
---
Will nobody tell us what this perk card _is_, so we can protect ourselves?
---
The event restarted and still no rewards. Fuck it I‚Äôm doing it again and uninstalling if it does the same.
---
I didn't try that either - should have, though.
---
Defense wise not too much a difference though strangler has better rad and poson I think. With strangler however its hard to find the mods you need. One of the biggest reasons I say t65 is because i am a bloodied build and you can currently build a jetpack arm with protocol chest ;)
---
Fun fact: There's a bug when attaching the Scorch Killer's receiver on it, where it increases its ROF. (SK receivers don't do this on any other weapon, as far as I know).  
---
This, combined with the ffr legendary effect, pushes its ROF over 200. This means if you get one with another 'magic' legendary effect on it, it turns into a magic weapon; the only magic weapon that commando builds can use. The only problem is, it eats ammo like nobody's business, also its range and accuracy are terrible.
---
Anyway, I personally think that the 10mm SMG needs some love first.
---
Idk, with this new enemy scaling plus people doing lunch boxes at events, I've been getting around 400xp per scorched lol
---
I feel like I've already earned 2-3 levels just from the xp repeatable and I'm not even going out of my way to grind
---
The ESO scaling is pretty ass. You never feel more powerful, in fact you feel *less* powerful when leveling up and obtaining new abilities etc. Which if 76's scaling is anything like ESO's...holy shit that'll be even worse. 
---
The problem with 76, well ok *a* problem with 76, is that everything is just a number increase. The only difference from 1 to 50 is that my rifle does X% more damage. Which is fucking boring. At least in ESO you get new abilities, aka new ways / tools to use in combat. 
---
On one hand, it is pretty amazing that things stay so flat. On the other, no one likes flat stuff; that's why austrailia banned A cups.
---
Get a mic and make some friends online. Hordes are easier to face with friends watching your back.
---
Not on my junkies builds to be honest. Only thing that got nerfed the hardest was melee, specifically bloodied melee builds. Have put mine on the back burner for now until they retool the dmg numbers and fix the mess.
---
Overall though all my bloodied/junkies builds, aside from the melee builds, haven't been messed with all that much. They're still a very viable build in game and instead of one shot killing everything, it takes 2-3 more rounds. Follow through legendary perk at level 4 brings a lot of that dmg back up to where it's not as heavily noticed before.
---
Hmm, I'll play around a bit more and see. 
---
Thanks for your feedback, though
---
4 lunch boxes, unyielding armour, 15 intelligence, cranberry relish, 15% more XP wile in a team, leader bobble head and then the casual team bonus
---
Yeah the new XP gain is insane lmao
---
Yes it does and it's awful because I found out by becoming Wanted.  Yay.
---
Could be just a hacked vertibot.
---
because you need max rank to unlock all the locks. otherwise you still need to manually do it.
---
I collect handmades and AA explosive, instigating explosive, executioner's explosive, and TSE explosive are all great weapons. I used them semi auto to keeps repair ammo costs down, full auto, they can get expensive to maintain. Vampire's handmades for some reason suck as a stimpack machine (ffr needed?).
---
its a magazine in fallout 76.

I carry 21 so I can donate 20 to the random NPC.

Well, truth be told, hell yeah he was excited to see you! But that was just because he wanted to kill you.

Lol nice exaggeration dude

Hot Diggity dog, that‚Äôs some serious dedication to maintain. Kudos!

I have not had any troubles yet but i totally understand peoples frustration. Tbh i dont understand what they wanted to achieve ...balancing they say but im not buying that 100%

Or someone melts it in mid air and the goo pile is invisible while floating beyond reach.
---
Yeah, can we please get a "ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS" prompt when opening owned containers or doors, please!
---
Sounds like server lag. Did you start fresh when you initially began the event, or was the timer already active?
---
If it's that much of a mess, I'd rather move on to another event. We all know the joys of Bethesda games üò¨
---
My magic shottie can 1 hit lvl 100s, I move back until I have 65% chance, I think I have hit every 65% I took yesttert, that seems to be sweet spot.
---
More likely that the team leader quit the game, which tells you that you were removed from the team.
---
I've been chugging grenades and I must admit they are surprisingly efficient, two frags and everything is dead

YOU COMMIE-LOVING BASTARD!!!
---
I was getting rekked by them today and raging hard.
---
Look into my historic, i got downvoted a couple of times on that subject. Everytime i tryed to share my experience nodody is debating me. It's gotta be Bloodied build haters...
---
honestly i didnt realize by scaling levels they meant everything would be exactly your level (except that random herd of level 50 yao guais that attacked me at level 25-30 in toxic valley, like what???). i thought that just meant a level 300+ entering my area wasnt going to make everything level 60+ while im playing a level 25 toon. i thought everything you ran into would be within a level range, like say youre level 30, so all the enemies you run into are like level 20-40 or something. i was so excited for this patch. i was not expecting to login and be introduced to nightmare mode for my poor mid level toon.  i wish this patch hadnt come riiiight when i was getting into my newest character too. my main is doing okay, but im bored with that one right now.
---
Don't forget the maintenance and laundry building. There's a lot of steel in there, but a good bit of plastic, too.
---
I didn't know if  it was really happening or not until this post, specifically the comment it evoked that had the link to Innov's video.   Not everyone sees every post that goes up, so yeah.   It was very helpful.
---
When you put /s and still get downvoted
---
According to Bethesda concentrated fire works the way it‚Äôs suppose to now üôÑ
---
My issue is with cosmetic gear being counted as armor. So I waste caps going to the persons shitty camp, just to find out they're selling worthless cosmetic gear. 
---
It'd be nice to see a preview of the items there, or at least more details. Like going to camps with 10 weapons, but they're all level 5 hunting rifles.
---
Do the main quest lines
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I gotta say chief, I‚Äôve both tried it and had it tried on me extensively post Patch 21. Not once have either myself nor anyone I tried it on (always with consent) taken any form of damage whatsoever from the Nuke Mine exploit.
---
If ur on xbox u can have mine
---
This was like when they capped damage levels in the PVP server. I was useless in there as a rifleman after they did that.
---
I've started the event 3 times so far and taken part in lots more, I don't start them to get the fixer plan, I start them because I haven't done the event for a while or i'm almost up to limit on caps and I can spare them for the card, if I got the plan then great i'd learn it, and if I did it again and got the plan again then it'd go in my vendor for 2.5-3k (2.5k + Bethesda's cut on top)  
---
I can see why players who are running the event multiple times to get the plan may want to place a higher value on it, it just doesn't have (or I don't place) the same value on it to me.
---
Oh nice!!! I‚Äôm set on buying the t65 bro! I didn‚Äôt know that either and I‚Äôm also a bloodied build. Thanks for the input! I also just bought the camo for the t65 in the atom shop so I have no choice now üò≠
---
Yeah, I assume that player must've got the same reward 3 days in a row. And they probably (mistakenly) thought it was a relatively common/easy item to get, given their own experience with it. Hence the really low listing price in their vendor.
---
I hate to say it, but now's the time to take advantage of people who have had terrible luck with RNG and who are uninformed of the drop rates of the items. (Can't take advantage of me though; I've had rotten RNG too, but my reward has been 'None' every time, lol)
---
I think the draw back is you have to have a disease. I've used it for a long.long time I cant recall it ever being permanent disease. Since I actively try to keep it up my food snd water issue becam pretty easy. Hungry? Rawr or rotten meat. Thirst? Go ahead drink that water the ghoul corpse is floating in.
---
No, it is not
---
discover and do quests. use different guns until you find something you really like than build around it than try find a level 45/50 version at player vendors for when you hit the max gear level.
---
i would suggest staying away from the bottom right of the map till about 40 because of the scorchbeast.
---
workshops are open pvp areas but if you take one you will most likely get a defend event within 60 seconds which grants stimpacks and easy exp. if you get killed by another player in this workshop area just ignore them and go elsewhere and do something else because some players want pvp and will get it no matter what.
---
all NPC vendors have a 1400 shared cap pool so it dosent matter where you go to sell.
---
This happened to me with a scorched attack dog between the Wayward and Flatwoods just a few hours ago. I didn‚Äôt really notice the head thing, though, as it was directly facing me. I was using my gatling laser and the ticks were registering like you said, but dealing no damage.
---
Totally worth it bud having protocols with jetpack us a gamechanger, i have strangler too but to be honest I couldn't say the slightly extra damage is worth it over the utility
---
can i ask what build you have and if you have a mic.
---
Thank you so much for the offer but I am on PC.
---
Well color me surprised, I genuinely could have sworn it was very positively received 
---
Do you reccomend ESO? I was thinking of giving it a try
---
I typically don't like mmos, but I like the lore and world and stuff, I wish it was a bit more like what they did with fo76 though haha
---
Would be cool if you could build a fort in ESO like the fo76 camps, instead of the premade homes you can buy and decorate
---
Stealth/sniper and I can invite you through my phone on my Microsoft app and use my phone as a mic so yes, I‚Äôm level 47 right now
---
VATS is the biggest issue out of all of this to be honest. It has been broken for a lot longer than the last 2 patches, but hasn't gotten any better over time and they just don't seem to either:
---
A) Know how to fix it
---
B) Really care to fix it
---
or
---
C) Are too worried that fixing it will undo all they've done so far and introduce another game breaking exploit.
---
Are you running any legendary perks, say Follow Through? That will help buff the dmg output closer back to what it was pre-nerf. It won't be 100%, but a lot more than it previously was.
---
Idk like I said, before patch 22, I was never going to kill a queen anything in one shot, but I was at least beneficial to my teammates in keeping hordes off them while they did the real damage. Now I just feel kind of useless with these guns and build.
---
But you will agree that it seriously lacks capacity.
---
I bring a ts tesla rifle with me in daily ops and its a breeze, they all die like the snap of a finger
---
It's 5 each. I can't be giving that away!!
---
Yup, got that on and maxed out, but it's still ultimately the same problem: it still takes 2 shots to 3 shots to kill something, no matter if I'm on my first kill or sixth. :/
---
Well explain bro...i tested it I play with all my builds (Bloodied Heavy Gunner, Bloodied Shotgunner, Bloodied Commando and Bloodied non-automatic rifle )...
---
It takes me 4 shots to kill a wendigo with a bloodied Lever action rifle, after that i'm just reloading and reloading. Completly unefficient. I have more success with my Bloodied Commando build down there ( Colosal Problem event ).
---
What's your experience !? You seem to be ok...so...what's your non-automatic rifle build ?
---
You don't have to have only combat perks to not suck at combat, you just need to have a build that doesn't just have all QOL perks 
---
Its not like it's different than other fallout games, if you didn't invest at all in combat stats, you would be having a hard time in fights too
---
Dude its so easy to pick locks. I only use like 1 or 2 for rank 3 locks. Git gud
---
It seams to me the spawn cap for enemies in these events is per type. Lets say the limit is 8 enemies for one person.
---
For super mutants because they are all basic super mutants you see very few at a given time, 5.
---
For blood eagles I noticed the dogs seam to be separate from humans, so you can get swarmed by dogs and humans at the same time for up to 10 enemies.
---
With robots it seams each robot type is it's own thing, so you get 5 handies, 5 eyebots, 5 gutsies, 5 protectrons with legs, 5 protectrons with tracks, and 5 robobrains constantly being spammed at you from all directions. We are lucky the only assaultron in the event is the boss, could you imagine adding 5 of those on top of everything else that is already in there.
---
Using a build can mean a heap of things. But at its most basic, it means use some damage perks related to your weapons. If you don't want to stack damage buffs, then you should not expect to have an easy time in combat. If you want to favour large carry weights and weight reduction perks, then you should not expect to be able to throw out damage anywhere near people who forego the QoL perks to be better at combat. If you are struggling with combat, then you need to rethink which perks you have equipped, that is what people mean when they say use a build. You stack QoL perks, you're a glorified pack brahmin and have the combat prowess of one, its as simple as that.  
---
\*EDIT\* Thanks for the award, many hugs to be shared!
---
Except without a super robot dressed as a sheep that can snipe you in one shot from across the map and then run to your body and ‚Äúbaaaaaaaaa‚Äù before you can hit the respawn button
---
Found out yesterday after finding 2/3 of the tubes and deciding to craft the repaired one while i was near a bench and right after the game told me to return to the chick. She doesnt even notice so definitely unintentionally.
---
Nope
---
our builds probably wont work too well with each other but i will give it a shot.
---
Hey man if your on Xbox I have a liquid courage recipe I‚Äôve been holding onto if you want it lmk
---
Its a great item, paid someone to build one in my camp, definitely worth it.
---
There's such a hero?
---
I've never really shopped for cosmetic or armor. Been a long time anyways. That is weird a cowboy outfit is counted as armor now that I think of it. Seen a lot of comments on vending and they should at least add a few more categories. Or something. But I guess they want people to interact and visit so the way it is would be the best way to achieve that...Bethesda will always lose lol.
---
On a few enemies it's a little better, but yea Junkies is still all around more reliable in terms of its damage output
---
Try a vampire weapon? I use a vamp flamer, never die nothing is hard to kill and I get to sell all the stim packs.
---
I get it if they're just trying to keep people from going after the same god tier gun or trying to make builds more viable. I just want a weapon that is balanced for what it is. Again, non automatic rifles aren't going to kill a SBQ in one shot, and they probably never should, but let me at least hit the little guys hard without being at a huge disadvantage because my gun is so slow.
---
Same on my lever build running both an I50 crit and a TSE lever. 2-3 shots at least depending on the level of trash mob I'm taking down. Also have to remember that all enemies are scaled to  your level as well now. So they've got higher resists and we're doing less dmg as well to boot on top of it and the issue with VATS being a dumpster üî• right now.
---
Both
---
Welp I‚Äôm an idiot who forgot to restart the power plant. Guess I didn‚Äôt complete it the first time lol.
---
I recommend trying to finish the Wastelanders quest line ASAP because it‚Äôll unlock the endgame currency ‚Äútreasury notes‚Äù that you‚Äôll need to cash in to get the very best gear in the game. You don‚Äôt start earning them until you finish that story unfortunately. You start this quest line by visiting a certain NPC in Sutton (no spoiler in case you don‚Äôt want to do it yet).
---
I finished all the original quests before doing the Wastelanders quests because it seemed ‚Äúright‚Äù, but then I realised how many treasury notes I missed out on and kicked myself...
---
There's a set in the Overseer's house on her top floor. It's in a glass case, but if you use an explosive you can knock it around until you can finally reach it and take it out. It won't necessarily look like you can reach it, but if you move the cursor around, you can find the sweetspot and grab it.
---
Thanks 
---
I fully forgot to sell stuff at vendors until now
---
Gun wise it will be the same as in fo4 a sniper :)
---
Melee is even worse.
---
It's happening outside VATS on Melee too though, clear hits (makes a noise, blood/sparks, etc) but isn't doing damage.
---
One thing is the huge amount of robot spawns in the daily ops. I don‚Äôt think bloodeagles or super mutants spawn in this quantities
---
i have the legendary perk car, wich charges your fusion core and heal zoo while you are in a pa and got energy damage from bots
---
this helps to manage the assaultron damage in the silo and from bots in the ops
---
I‚Äôve had this occur when I fight cargobots oddly enough, I empty and entire mag at point blank range and either hit them all and do no damage or miss them all and I‚Äôm super confused why
---
Lol, happens to us all at least once
---
You can put the standered paint on them. But they're useless anyway haha
---
Ironically a ‚Äúfloater‚Äù is also a turd that refuses to be flushed, much like these grenades
---
Yea it should be 250 power at least. Or just copy the 500 from 4.Those reactors are massive. In fallout lore they are used to power entire vaults and only one is typically needed. I noticed vault 94 has 3 fusion reactors an not super reactors. The nuke silos have super reactors. 100 power is so low in terms of how the lore an game uses them.
---
Yea some people have gotten some
---
Not me tho, I keep getting the stupid light bulb plans lol

Remember when it used to take 1? Two, if the damn wendigo saw you first? Good times.

After this patch there was a way to go red to people easier of certain circumstances happened. They can still get your base without being red by using explosive bait though
---
Fucking ouch. Unarmed wasn't even my main weapon against him because he hits like a truck at melee range but now the risk/reward is laughable. I guess I'll only use unarmed to kill the Wendigos. 
---
God I hope it's still good to kill the Wendigos.
---
so what your saying is you do need more than 1 to pick multiple locks.
---
Use camo paint on t65 a d apply jetpack to arm
---
I use a fancy pump action, and hot damn it blows through just about everything
---
Deaf and Mute people do. People who don't want to hear someone with food in their mouth do. Stop being such a selfish cunt.
---
Why get good max the legendary perk carry 1 unbreakable bobby pin pick locks/hack for free untill the heat death of the universe step 4 profit.... ps it frees 3 spots for other cards since you dont need to swap 3 cards for hacks or opening doors yall sleepin if you think its useless
---
What can ya do
---
I have a ton of qol perks, but also damage perks.  That's the trick.  You have to have damage too.
---
Can you then change the paint after the jetpack is attached?
---
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
---
That. You can't excel in carrying all your junk and never getting hungry and do well in combat. This is on online multiplayer game. You need to take some combat perks to do well in combat. That's just the nature of the beast
---
I can help you. No charge. Have plenty of flux. Sent you a message
---
Now too depending on how much food/water you keep on hand you can use a symptomatic to clear out disinterest or parasites and wait for a more manageable disease.
---
Usually tho I never worry about clearing out diseases. The extra damage is helping out in those situations where 1 shotting an enemy automatically drops them to just a sliver.
---
It does come in legendary. But it can not be traded

Prior to One Wasteland I was getting 1010 damage with Adrenaline (AGI) maxed out (if you haven't invested in that perk I highly recommend doing so, it does make a huge difference) now it's dropped down to 797 (odd number) but it's still a formidable weapon and can take out most lvl50-75 enemies with one shot, but I digress...
---
Have you tried using scope? I have found that I can pick things off just as easily from a considerable range by using scope. Obviously not ideal in a mob situation. 
---
Oh and one last thing, Demolition Expert (INT) the Gauss is an explosive weapon... that'll bump up your damage also.
---
Edit: spelling and wording
---
&gt; Well color me surprised, I genuinely could have sworn it was very positively received
---
Do not get me wrong, it might be well received, but I've seen dog food be well received by people; that doesn't mean it's good. 
---
I *personally* don't recommend ESO, but I'm an MMO vet. Its combat is piss poor compared to others within the "action combat" style of MMO. On top of that, you also have position updating issues / latency issues. Think you're not standing in a circle? Guess again.
---
It's missing some standard features like auctions / market, instead relying on "guild stores" which change. Think 76, where if you want to buy something, you have to hope you're on a server w/ a player who has it listed. 
---
If you like the lore of Elder Scrolls, it wouldn't hurt to try. I've never been a fan of the setting, and I'm an asshole with very high expectations (literally part of my job). For what it's worth, it looks like a diamond compared to 76, if that puts things in perspective.
---
200 levels as a junkies heavy. I think the build is doing fine. I never notices my special stats. And my damage is great
---
I... just got rid of 1
---
Can u get the plan more than once?
---
Yeah, this is a lame vagary. I've spent a ton of time trying to get a complete set of one or the other. Still 2 pieces shy either way. Stupid game.
---
I made a very similar post this morning too. The new update made me play the game more like the post-apocalyptic game it is than before. I have to think a bit more about how I approach different situations and I actually love that. Even though I'm a super casual player that does next to nothing when it comes to reading up on how to optimize my build etc. I just play to have fun.
---
Weaps &amp; plans... at the point where theres no reason really to visit player venders if not for the odd plan i havnt yet learned or to see what legendaries I can make builds around... also to shoot your Brahmin... yes Im that guy.. but I only shoot the ones that dont assume the position.. for me to sex them.
---
Bless you, i never realised how annoying them things are hahaha
---
What im saying is that you dont need unbreakable lock picks, just to get good and carry more than like 10 on you at a time
---
Yup, my build actually is literally based on food and hauling as much as possible, but I've still invested enough into my main weapon type that most everything's been a breeze 
---
Unrelated but I've also found that most people I've talked to that are having a really hard time haven't messed with modding their weapons at all, which is also a huge factor if they're running around with base weapons
---
Ironically enough, I never even handed him the photos, so I don't know what his reaction is if I do, maybe when I finish the reputation grind party I'll make him happy, just once...
---
Electrical absorption also heals you, and it is intended. It is a great perk, I'd recommend it

Edit, also drop power user anyway unless you use gattling lasers
---
Survival syringes are extremely op
---
Miss my home every day. Every time I hear this song it brings a tear to my eye.
---
AA, Reduced Weight, %50 limb damage, one shots lvl 100 super mutants. 3/4 shots behemoths.
---
If yall are on xbox, i will gladly lend a hand
---
Does it? I interpreted wrecking ball as being limited to workshops. But then again contractor isn't limited to workshops and says it is...
---
Really? Keep semi-auto? Huh. You‚Äôre the first to tell me that. I have the perks already, and I‚Äôm using semi already, so that‚Äôs nice.
---
Suppressed, right? For some reason, I can‚Äôt get the suppressor mod.
---
I don't get how anyone would ever think non automatic rifles were really all that great to begin with.
---
Don't have to carry to much, jist eat what you kill and stop at the many water puddles along your path. =D
---
Very true
---
Its 750
---
Well, after it happening again on a different character, as well as having A Collossal Problem crash in the middle on me after I launched the nuke at the damned mine to trigger the event, I did. 
---
Both my crashes tonight were in the middle of fights after I killed enemies in daily ops and in ACP.
---
Can u craft legendary war glaives?
---
Bah! Lol of course my lowest leveled char would get it, but it‚Äôll be put to good use.
---
Are you still at 20% hath though?  Because that's about 150% more damage still.
---
Do you play both, or just fallout 76? Just find it kinda funny you seem to dislike ESO, feel like it's a diamond compared to fo76, and yet are here in the fo76 sub on a random post lol
---
No offense meant, just found it a little humorous
---
Same Challenges Only Recycling Events
---
Hellnah hop on ur mic n make him feelbad
---
What are the rolls on the shotgun, it is a magic one im betting on it
---
You say keep semi? I have full rifleman, but time to kill is surprising. Would it go down with a suppressor?
---
Do the benefits of the addictions go away on the weapon if your actively using the items that caused said addictions?
---
Never tried junkies yet but I regularly have addictions to alcohol, berry mentats, and psychobuff. Noticed too that the icon for alcohol addiction changes if you gained it from say whiskey versus Nuka Cola Dark.
---
Does that mean that there are 2 separate forms of alcohol addiction? 
---
Since I regularly use those buffs for major encounters I tend to always have a decent number on hand if I need them cleared for a time.
---
PSN xa0t1ca is in (middle o is a zero).
---
I feel you guys. At least my quad version has a big enough mag to waste some shots. Still, this is not ideal.
---
Depends on what you're using them for? Queen fights? Useless against her. Quickly taking out enemies that swarmed the people who could actually do damage to her? Damn useful.
---
I'm over 400 and still have no idea how people get animals in their camps. Sometimes I see a cow or deathclaw and think "XP!!" and kill them and then think "Oh...I've become one of them" But I've never thought about making love to any of them. You're weird. But I kind of like your attitude.
---
same :/
---
supermutants have usually armor on back and when it hide head in VATS it only reduce hit chance. Critical shot hits anyway.
---
Regarding damage mitigation, I'd be happy with them changing it to scale off of your equipped armour, rather than overall, so you could use Barbarian/Ironclad/Evasive.  
---
The damage is solid though. It's the same scaling as Junkie's which is viable for endgame content, though it could be a bit higher given the extra risk you're taking.  
---
Bloodied was 100% the hardest hit by the change though. It's got both the biggest damage multiplier *and* has multiple damage multipliers. It's still very strong, but the gap is much smaller than what it used to be.
---
Sounds like you're just bitter, fix your shit and stop whining. Everyone know two handed melee is crap anyways.
---
3 things, did you have pacifist on? They were most likely using quantums. Finally, they were prob using the best pvp armor in the game, powered sentinels assasins armor, which is crazily op
---
I have a quad one for a long time now, its goooood!
---
Low rate of fire weapons as a whole are pretty pointless now. They were hit the hardest.
---
Either way is a good build, but i play vats sniper and with concentrated fire 3 i have 60ish first headshot and 90s pretty much everything after. Its ridiculous how strong that build can be. I also have suppressor on and covert operative for night sneak bonus. I clear out all of harpers ferry in a matter of minutes
---
I've experimented with 40% down to pretty much dead, and I honestly don't see the difference. Yeah, one of the shots *almost* kills the enemy, but I still need a second to kill them.
---
Which platform? If you're on PS4 add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) and send me a message reminding me this happened. I have a delivery. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Could you not just switch out your perks and go full auto?
---
No sadly but i still like it
---
Really appreciate the offer, but I switched to PC right before Wastelanders, and haven‚Äôt really looked back tbh. As luck would have it, Liquid Courage dropped for me today üòÆüòÉ
---
It's supposed to be less than or equal to, which is the less than symbol with a line under it.
---
Level scaling is great.  I joined an event team, got the x4 exp buff, met the wise Mothman then killed Earl and SBQ after opening a bunch of lunch boxes.  Went from level 70-85 in a few hours.  
---
I'm not running a meta build, just a crappy rifleman. The challenge is outstanding.
---
This game is so much better now.
---
Teach me the way üëÅüëÑüëÅ
---
People are opening there old mole miner pales atm. Since they have a chance at dropping the new treasure hunter rewards, even though Bethesda said they wouldn't be able to haha
---
Nah, you can't strawman for Bethesda for putting out a game with code that had not been properly player tested. The B.E.T.A. test was a lie, their game was already 'finished' and ready to ship. And look at us, fucking THREE years out and the game still isn't even CLOSE to being fixed. Duping still exists, many of Bethesdas promises made 3 years ago still have not been kept, the game is still MASSIVELY bugged. There are so many exploits in this game its mind boggling. Name ANY three star game manufacturer that behaves this way release after release after release.
---
Did Bethesda bring this upon themselves? YUUUUUUUP.
---
Now we are done here.
---
Dammit, I just scrip'd a 3 star
---
Yeah it is :)
---
What about 100%?  What's the difference between 100% and 20%?
---
plural from Lego is still Lego not Legos.. yes im Lego fan.
---
I just use glowing blood instead, since I wear chemist backpack anyway since the new patch it only weights 0.03 each
---
Heard mentality give you +2 if you just make a public team and are in it ALONE.
---
It does not work for weapons with the bullets explode prefix I can tell you that much
---
That‚Äôs the thing I don‚Äôt use power armor. Even if I did I don‚Äôt know if fusion cores would be a problem? I have like 27 and I‚Äôm not even hunting them. I even drop them a lot. But for you guys it makes sense.
---
I use a ts tesla, and it is an absolute breeze, easy elder solo, if ur on xbox, i can trade with you for a junkies tesla
---
Me to everyone who says master infiltrator is good.
---
Huh. I‚Äôll stick with stealth rifleman for now. If I want more damage, I‚Äôll check out vats sniper!
---
If you don't use pa a lot then go with something else. I live in pa so it's a must have for me, solely for the healing though. I get more fusions cores than I'll ever need, just had to sell 70 of them
---
It‚Äôs a legendary perk which fully restores your hunger, water and it heals you. It‚Äôs like a super super stimpack
---
You can always rebuild. One time I was at a camp where this was happening and I sat there repairing everything as it was destroyed. Eventually they got bored. I felt good about myself. 
---
There's scumbags in life. Never let them read a post like this thinking they won. You are pouring gas on the miserable hell fire of a life they live.
---
Isn‚Äôt it this way because technically one is considered light and the other heavy?
---
Are you saying you‚Äôre a heavy gunner? I‚Äôd run like 9 heavy gunners, barbarian, and bandolier. That‚Äôs like 14 I think?
---
Life is old there, older than the trees
---
No. Only crafts at standard. The mods cost bullion
---
damn thats going to impact me, might have to unslot it in the meantime :(
---
Dude you're late to the party, this was 2 months ago. I run Herd Mentality _and_ Empath these days, along with Strange in Numbers to boost the stat bonus to +3 instead of +2 and the damage reduction to 33%.
---
Robots are very easy to deal with as they do no damage to me.
---
i think both are sturdy
---
Lol the rank 99 reward with no utility. People who grinded for it would be pissed
---
Not sure about this but they do have the exact same stats.
---
I‚Äôd be down but I‚Äôm not one for PvP. I do however have all crafting perks &amp; a shit ton of stimpacks. Would gladly play support the downfall of raider trolls.
---
Oh definitely. I'm going to sound difficult though, when I'm really not trying to be, but I really *love* my levers. I collect them: I have 50ish on my character, I have several of each variant, and even have explosive versions of each except double, berserkers and executioners. I love that damn gun, and to see it taken out back and shot hurts me to my very core. I will never love a gun like I love that gun. It's a "I want one in real life" kind of love.
---
So yes, if I want to actually be any use in this game, I may consider switching. But I also really want Bethesda to see this, so maybe, just *maybe*, they'll figure out this problem.
---
ETA: I still remember being level 25, finding a lever, and the game completely changing for me for the better. *I really love this damn gun.*
---
Sometimes having a build IS quality of life, without a build your not going to have a nice time the further levels you achieve. Having a build helps you survive and thus makes it easier to enjoy your stay in Appalachia, having a healthy balance of QoL perks and damage negating/causing perks is key.
---
Concentrating just on QoL isn't going to give you that in the long run, it's neither going to be quality or life as your going to be canned by every high enemy you encounter within the wastes.
---
I do get that not everyone wants to go round constantly killing s@#t but it's a harsh world out there and you have to make some QoL sacrifices if your wanting to survive now, buffing your weapons whatever you use is a must, it's not as if you can stay in the relative safety of foundation/crater
---
Thats what i meant lol. Stealth rifleman. But make sure u get tank killer 3
---
Yeah I posted this the other day, it‚Äôs pretty stupid, should count scout armor as a full set regardless of the colour.
---
I like using Cola Nut with Party Girl to utilize Nuka cola Dark for 6 strength and Endurance. Making the myriad of spirits I find in the world a fast means to fill thirst or tip myself out of overencumberance. 
---
Makes all the soda pops and booze great buffs in boss fights.
---
I thought it was  a hassal at first having to collect the mats to make whiskey but turns out darks are way easier to craft.
---
Found that my snaptail run is also a great source, wood, bloodleaf, and soot flowers for making healing salves, which can be popped back to back much more quickly,  and seems they allow you to rez people too.
---
That and it clears the loot tables so I can revisit other areas with more valuable loot. Tend to never be short on psychobuff mats after doing a red nurse outfit run.
---
Will hopefully find one someday.
---
If the camp owner is around, I call them over toward thier Brahmin with the "come here" emote. Turn on my mic and with a German accent demand to know "Vere have u hidden za amulet Dr Jones!" "Comply or your vife shalt not see tomorrow!".... Gotten some legendaries out of it actually, the brahmin never makes it.
---
Sometimes when the first or second hit miss when they should certainly hit, I exit vats and retarget and it works again.
---
Oh I know what you meant. I just might not do a vats build. It‚Äôs more fun for me to aim manually, and while I love slicing through the wasteland like a knife in hot butter, I still want to have fun.
---
It makes so so \*\*\*\*\*\* mad when I have a right arm selected. You see the left side of their body and fire and do zero damage. Bethesda needs to use common sense and understand that if you target the arm on the other side of the body you are still doing damage on the side that's facing you. I feel like this is the problem. They think we selected the back of the head but it's the front head we selected. It's laziness and stupidity. But I guess it all trickles down from the top now doesn't it Todd.
---
My vampire gat plas says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wear what i want ‚Äú
---
  I noticed its gotten worse since the update. I also notice that its horrible at tracking mobs even when the % is at 95%. Sometimes the mob will move to the left 1 step and VATS acts like the mob went and hid behind a house..
---
But I even get 1.5k XP for level 100 super mutants and I found a new spawn influence on line in the sand where they spawn just in 1 place too
---
I like building bases so it would be more of something I care for than the chicken coop
---
Or at the very least you gotta accept that if you want to have a comfy QOL only build like that, you're gonna need to group 
---
Not unlike letting your companions pull some weight in the past games by equipping them with rediculous gear lol
---
I know that, I just remember early on in the game dataminers found some reason for them being different, but I‚Äôll have to look
---
Edit: wiki says both are sturdy, but at one point the damage stats for the urban were incorrect, but the forest were okay, so my guess is the game recognizes each armor as a different type rather than a variant.
---
Younger than the mountains, growin like a breeze.
---
I saw this and thought "Alright lets see this garbage" But am very impressed. This is actually an awesome shot. Never even thought to try and grab one during the fight.
---
Assuming the season is 100 days long, you only need to get about 2500 score per day
---
Yeah. It's something a lot of people wanted. That's why it's limited to the season. You're lucky anything from season 1 is purchasable with gold. They are ment to be limited time things
---
Yeah I saw after I posted, but now I'm going to check on adding empath since I dont have it currently... So thanks!!
---
I also have a bloodied lever action rifle and it takes me the same amount of bullets, I don't see the issue. It takes more bullets to kill, so what? It's called stealth, sneak and get the multiplier sneak damage, and hit the head too.
---
Been there the whole time. Reportedly it's a spawn for the 50 cal, but I have never found one there.
---
No, it's always been there... I'm puzzled how you missed it seeing as at least one quest takes you right next to it
---
I'd say it lasted about two months
---
I've already done it 130 times since the start of the season, lol.
---
I have played both. Both because of a friend. ESO has a lot wrong with it, it is only saved due to the fact that ES fans, much like Fallout fans, seem to have little to no experience with multiplayer games, let alone MMOs. 
---
I am not an expert in ESO, I'm just referencing base mechanical and experiential issues the game has. I think it's a fine casual MMO, where one doesn't expect tight and interesting combat, wants to experience more of ES lore, etc. 
---
I'm very mechanically orientated, a min maxer, etc. So take my views with that knowledge in mind.
---
We're taking a break from 76 atm, so I come here to see what state the garbage fire is in. I'm also livid that the devs are so incompetent that they, seemingly, couldn't figure out a way to stop players from stealthing the new ops, so they just removed the ability for stealth builds in them. Not to mention a whole laundry list of other issues with the game. 
---
Plus I like to poke the proverbial hornets nest a bit, as it were.
---
Why is scout armor unmodifiable? Always makes it just slightly less disappointing than finding legendary wood armor.
---
I miss the strange, arbitrary numbers in the levels - where‚Äôs my level 68 charred feral at?
---
Since shotties still do magic damage i just run with a quad db and switch to a vamp combat when i need to heal.
---
When the magic eventually gets patched i'll probably use my junkies gauss or two shot gauss.
---
I sent them a message. Had a monumental brain lapse.
---
Oh, bloodied is useless at full health, so there's going to be a huge difference. I've been experimenting with a TSE lever and an IE lever and they're pretty much 1 to 3 shot kills depending on the enemy, so it's kind of same difference issue. :/
---
The way was using one of the several xp exploited available in the early game
---
That's my point.  You can obviously tell the difference which means damage does matter.   Damage perks matter too.
---
Lol they put in 2 things, one which you got within the first week of playing the board. And the other is the same thing as the cow but it just gives more at once.  I wouldn't say luck has anything to do with it.
---
I think 50 is a bit overboard... Some of us would be getting 1000+ in a day.
---
 I think the best thing that ever happened to my CAMP was it was in the Blast zone at the Golf Course. For the longest time every time I spawned in I got to watch the building explode leaving me a couple sticks for walls. 
---
  Im still not sure what happened, if it was just rebuilt over time or the community felt bad for me cause after awhile every time I came back from doing events and quest a random wall or roof was rebuilt..
---
it is :D its jus that u got to buy the mods frm the whitespring bunker millitary wing armoury
---
No, my overall point is if I have max adrenaline/gun-fu/rifleman, etc on, why am I still getting the same exact results as when I took them all off.
---
Get yourself a set of troubleshooters armor. I have 4 out of 5 pieces of SS armor as troubleshooters and it negates a huge amount of the damage they do and increases survivabilty. The only time Ive gone close to dying was that bitch assaultron today. I plan on having a 5th piece too. Just need the RNG gods to stop smiting me
---
quad ffr is one of the best dps weapons in game
---
The radical differences in the number of perks gauntlet and daggers need to be effective is staggering.  
---
Really hope they rebalance the 2 in the future. I love my cultist dagger but I cant rationalize dropping that many defensive strength perks for what's not even half the value. Of the others base 3. If that, since gauntlets tend to do just fine without unarmed perks too.
---
I always shit on Bethesda and say terrible things. So wanted to be fair and say you are correct. People say the infiltrator card is a waste but I'm someone who left 3 lock picking cards equipped at all times. Love picking locks, too lazy to always swap cards. It's awesome to finally get something so many have been begging for. The rest is all an awesome addition. Too many people who complain don't understand the definition of perks. Legendary perks are one of my favorite additions to this game.
---
Have you tried tank killer?
---
Woah rilly??
---
Seems I've been neglecting exploring those venders properly.
---
Tho... I'm will be alot of caps, I'm sure, when I'm transitioning to Secret Service armor already. 
---
Mebe should at least check the arms out.
---
Yeah those gutsies will eff you up but a vampire weapon will help immensely.
---
Ah no I totally get that 
---
And while that is probably the case for the no stealth in the daily ops, they did say they're working on another daily op game mode where stealth is incentivized, and other builds will have a hard time.
---
They're going for the idea that multiple game modes will cater to different players, some daily ops will be "made for you" and some will be brutal.
---
Is it easier to program stuff by doing it this way? Almost certainly yes lol
---
But even if it's a shortcut, I'm looking forward to the variety, the daily ops have been their best idea in a while, it just came in at the same time as one of their most controversial changes, with the new enemy scaling and damage calculations lol
---
You have an explosive plasma caster? That's not suppose to be a thing
---
Don't do this, just move perk points from luck to agility
---
yeah
---
Here we go...i knew you was on an other planet üòë 
---
Good, keep stealthing, it will definitetly help you in Daily Ops and the "Scorched Earth"  event and a "Colosal Problem". üòê
---
Before, in danger you could still count on Gunfu, Adrenaline and Grim Reaper's Sprint to do the job. Now it's an other story. If you get caught and get in "Danger" you are in serious trouble. That's a big issue. Same shit with the other non-automatic rifles. The v.a.t.s. gameplay "in intense situations" with non-automatic rifles is near dead right now.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs any body part intercepting the attack, and poof, no damage despite a hit.
---
I've looked though them so many times and haven't seen this?
---
Had that on too, still the same end result. God, I feel like I'm being difficult, but I'm mostly just frustrated with seeing no difference between having all the correct perk cards on to do a ton of damage and it still taking 2 shots to kill something, versus taking them all off and maybe needing 3. Four if it's a tougher enemy like a supermutant. I'm getting no bang for my buck basically.
---
COUNTRY ROOOOOAAAAAAADS, TAKE ME HOOOOOOMMMMEEEEEEE
---
they just need to fuckin delete floater grenades.
---
Heavy gunner shotgunner and melee, can do all 3 but I also like to horde lol üòÜ. I'm running bear arms all the heavy gunner perks and bandolier now. Be nice is could have some weight reduction perks also.
---
Apparently you can miss 15 days as long as you do all the dailies on the others. That as well as there being double score events planned means to be on track now you need to be rank 0!
---
Yeah, it is garbage.  Garbage that I still have to deal with level 50's and that they aren't all level 100
---
Tried again today got all the way to the alpha and he just bitch slapped my friendly into dust.
---
I mean, that's 25 to 50% more ammo, is it not?  Is that not significant?
---
Also anyone who uses this build any advice , tips and tricks would be greatly appreciated üëç
---
This explains it better than I could.

A simple mistake,  and it's not like they haven't conditioned us into see everything that is slightly off from our expectations as being a bug or glitch anymore.
---
From elder specifically.  Technically a out 83.5% over all.
---
Once upon a time there was a mechanism that causes high level enemy spawns in the ash heap and savage divide every time a high level player passed through
---
it was tough to fight against lvl 50 super mutants or ghouls or mole miners.
---
wasteland was a though playground long before patch 22, got nerfed and is now though again
---
I would imagine not very conducive for a stealth build?
---
I mean, Activision and Bethesda are both guilty of porting old buggy code into new games, but the way they handle those issues are different. The problems stem from the rollout deadlines. Games take time to develop, developers have always been guilty of rushing games to market, and the incentive is always there as the video game market continues to grow. Activision just seems a little more worried about its reputation than Bethesda.
---
Pics or you don‚Äôt.
---
Been seeing this a lot. Being over 400 it's a noticeable difference, I really enjoy it even tho I die a lot more often. The game was way too easy. So  as you play don't think it will stay that way forever. It's still going to become 1000x easier. WAYYYYY easier from what you describe. I only have 1 toon so have no clue what it's like. I remember playing at the beginning and it was hard. Had to stick to certain places, never had meds or junk. Camp was garbage. Back then it could of been a little bit harder but I wonder what it's like now. People make it sound brutal.
---
I am not the only one who is not satisfied with the reactor capacity. I hope that the developers will take this factor into account and fix it soon. I had big plans for him. But after getting only 100 points, I can't implement my idea.
---
mb this guide will help you https://youtu.be/jagOtAvr9DU
---
widescreen capture. no edit.
---
It doesn't work for weapons with that modifier.
---
Why I told my newbie friend to not put basic armor or weapons in his. Low level legendaries are at least great for people needing scrip. Or as hand me downs.
---
Vats critical only stacks to 90% I think, there is "better crits" perk to add more damage on a vats critical shot. There is "crit savvy" which makes it so a vats critical shot cost less, rather than using up you full crit meter, it will use a lot less, in turn you won't have to fill it to fire critical shot. There is a perk that fills up you crit meter based on luck. Can't remember the name but I think it has a chance to fill crit meter if you kill an enemy, or just shoot them.
---
You can also have an effect on a weapon "vats critical shots do 50% more damage" and there is also an effect to fill up your crit meter "your critical meter fills up 15% faster".
---
There are chems etc to to help boost critical damage but that's roughly about it.
---
Thank you for the explanation I do think it‚Äôs weird calling a weapon magic haha
---
Fair point, but when you only got 5 shots per reload, I don't know if saving one or two bullets is a good trade off.
---
I don't understand what you mean.
---
He used the photo mode glitch to get threw the doors
---
And probably the pa glitch to get past the laser grid
---
Have I talked to you about my lord and savior?
---
Unyielding armor.
---
afaik 
---
hotfixes dont run through console cert it comes straight from beth servers
---
Since a lot of people don't know this, you can chuck a grenade in vicinity of a mob, target it in vats and shoot it to blow it up when it gets close. Shooting a grenade seems to increase the explosive radius by about 100% since it explodes midair instead of on the ground.
---
I made one of my builds around an Ashe character design from Overwatch. Lever action rifle main, chucking 'dynamite' at enemies and blowing it up, with a backup double barrel shotgun and marsupial for theme, western outfit and hat. The only issue is the robot sidekick, so I usually try to run around grouped with my buddy Saabify who wears the X-01.
---
I'm all for this.
---
Now a new challenge for you, how to fix blood sacrifice?
---
Reasom to the low price were the duoers... I remember i got a blood TSE handmade back in the days for free.
---
Power armor makes staggers better.  Theres a mod for chest peices that lessens it as well.
---
Anyone else having issues using stimpacks? I have tonhit RD like4-8 times for it to register then it ends up using multiple at once.
---
How did he destroy it ?
---
Really? Who sells them? Finally something to spend my gold on. Been at max gold for weeks.
---
I fear anymore and it would be a major drain on the camp budget.
---
Tore up my camp trying to fit it on the roof before I realized it was strictly a floor item. Couldn't get it to place on a single foundation buy heard it would for 4 foundation tiles. 
---
Really feels like it was designed with other factors in mind we dont yet have access to.
---
Can at least add stuff to it to make it look like their funny or angry faces.
---
Man I'm dying to have instanced camps and mannequins.
---
I don't even use stealth anymore, the crits in VATS paired with low VATS cost and max adrenaline is too good!
---
I like to toss them at the SBQ and shoot them when she refuses to land. Especially the plasma ones.
---
&gt;I get it if they're just trying to keep people from going after the same god tier gun or trying to make builds more viable.
---
But are they? Is that really working? If anything it has further limited builds and weapon useage, God tier weapons/armor is more needed than ever to survive, non auto is practically non existent now and pretty much forget about pistols and bows/crossbow
---
Your either corralled into a commando or a heavy build now no matter what other preference you were ie bloodied/junkie etc... just in order to survive and keep your QoL
---
Uhh, sorry, ummm. I don't think the chance to save 2 bullets per enemy is useful with these guns. If the guns broke slower, maybe, but if my gun is still breaking at the same rate pre-patch 22, if not faster because I'm shooting it more.
---
Intend to waste more budget wiring an entire camp to the fusion generator.
---
I also play bloodied, so of course I always have toxic water and can afford to spend the time on those extra few clicks to start a new team. I'm not going to assume negative intentions from a total stranger without objective data.
---
Yeah im max bud I used to have 600 carry weight most days I've managed to get that down to 360 now with me damage perks on had to make some mules.
---
The barrel? I thought it was an exclusive drop from radiation rumble...
---
To the place I BELOOONGGG

Maybe recreated a decon shower hall.

Yeah, the game gets much simpler and you have access to items as it goes on. Just play the game and take care of quests and level up and eventually itll come to you
---
Didn't you just say you were annoyed that you had to spend a couple more bullets per enemy?
---
I was more so disappointed in how its essentially useless unless you build your camp around it.
---
Always  :D
---
Do the weapons have stars in them? If so they are legendary. Some legendary weapons are really good and can be traded for a lot. Some are useless and should go to the scrip machine found at train stations.
---
There is no way to change the level of the weapons, unfortunately.
---
Some events are hard. Camp Fire Tales is more difficult now after the new update that came on Tuesday.  Just keep at it, you will get to grips with everything.
---
Use to have to walk five miles uphill on legos just to get to school
---
I use between 6-10 non-dps/survivability cards at all times other than boss fights. Those are Happy Camper 2, Travel Agent, Good With Salt 3, Born Survivor 1, and First Aid 3. Do just fine against normal mobs with 1h melee (although I've been itching to swap to unarmed). I guess it really just depends on exactly how many QoL perks you're going for if your damage is suffering...
---
I was in a team yesterday with two other people and we completed an Op. Another person joined about two minutes after we all had exited and we were all busy doing other things (sorting our stash, selling stuff etc) and he left about 30 seconds later and made his own team. 
---
If you start an Op and wait, usually the rest of the team will follow in my experience.
---
typical bethesda mate
---
To bad ammo weight is a problem even with the perk
---
I thought all that was patched though i was looking at vids on youtube about the PA laser grid and photo mode but they all say theyve been patched now.
---
Shoot it, increases the radius.
---
Pneumatic.
---
I know but man, I am a vendor seller and am always near max weight (even at 455 lbs alnost), the extra 10 would've gotten me to and from without having to drink some purified water to bring my weight down. I know it'll be fixed and was just a 30 min timer on the glitched buff but its just annoying.
---
Seriously a dick move.  If there's any way I can help you rebuild op, I will. On xbox
---
I have a love hate relationship with this gun. When its beam focuses properly in VATs its amazing.  
---
When it doesn't and or fast enemies run out in front me me continuously causing me to blow my own face off... then not so much.
---
Tend to have to exclusively use it in third person to get the faster fire speed to compensate for when it refuses to focus.
---
No clue if I circumvent that by boosting a specific form of accuracy. 
---
Did I hear right that when they say hip fire they actually mean VATs?
---
You keep all benefits even when you suppress an addiction
---
You can vats grenades, and explode them in midair to increase the explosive radius
---
West Virginia Mountain Mommaaaa take me Hoooome country roads
---
No but I only have the problem on Beth version when I play into borderless. So I play on steam version
---
I don't think they have. They patches a single glitch in the silos roof you could jump threw
---
I remember reading in the patch notes that they're doing this for the overall health of the game so that's what I thought they were going for, but who knows. Maybe the thought process will become clearer soon.
---
Must be simple then to find 5 good ones you can suppress on the fly if their your favorite buffs.
---
Unless you just outright refuse to use chems/alcohols ever.
---
People seem to get weird about what they wont allow their characters to do.
---
First off, welcome to the wasteland! For the quest, I‚Äôm guessing you mean campfire tales. This quest might just be too advanced for you to solo at the moment, but there are plenty of things in your level range to do! I personally would follow the main story quests for a while, with the responders, raiders, and other factions that you‚Äôll discover. Events might be difficult on your own for now, but if you see any with a lot of players on the map, feel free to join in! If you tag the enemies, you‚Äôll gain xp, and you‚Äôll gain xp for the event just for participating in the area. Doing high level events like line in the sand with other players is a good way for low levels to level up quickly, but you might die a lot in the process. 
---
As for the level 50 weapon, if it‚Äôs something you want, you‚Äôll have to store it until you reach that level. If it‚Äôs not something you find useful scrap it or turn it in for legendary scrip. 
---
Finally, camps are purely a matter of taste, some people have basic camps with just the necessities and others have elaborate mansions. Me, I like a nice but quaint little wooden shack in the woods with all the necessities one could want. Not flashy, but big enough for everything I need. Collecting plans becomes an endgame task though, it‚Äôs just something to spend caps and grinding time on. Anyway hope this helped. Happy hunting!
---
Edit: must mention that the main quests pre-wastelanders are a little dry, but if you stick with them they level you up and take u everywhere u need to go in game. The end of the game is very satisfying too, imo!
---
Yeah, the weapons have stars. Do you mean trade with other players or like NPCs/Vending machines? Can you please also explain what a scrip machine is? 
---
Thanks for your reply :)
---
This is intended, so you can shoot incoming grenades. You can also shoot your own grenades to increase the radius and have them explode exactly when you want.
---
Yes.  Pneumatic like Lenina Crowne.
---
Why do they boot I don‚Äôt understand that
---
Regs sells them. They are 200 bullion each and theres 4 different blades to collect. Plasma, Electric, Fire and Cryo
---
Yeah walking around at 360 as a starting point is pretty bad. But, I'm usually 270 at my very lightest. Right now I'm right where you are most of the time. Moved stuff to mules a few dozen times already but It always gets bad again eventually.
---
Ok thank you
---
That‚Äôs One Wastelander for ya. Pick a build, pick your best 2 or 3 weapons that fit your specific build, and that is the game from now on. Every event you go to you now has no variation... pull out that maxed 50 cal and start using your ammo on bullet sponges. Boring!
---
High level players maxed everything out and then complained that the game was too easy.  This was Bethesda's solution... make the game less fun for everyone who wants some variation in their gameplay.
---
This is still aggrivating me. The inspect picture had bright red boots but there is no way to make it a reality
---
Man, I feel so bad that I have to lie to him everyday for 60 caps after the photo mission...
---
Seems like every time I kill Earle this happens. Stuck in the floor. In the wall. In the ceiling. In the support column. Costs us time and Wendigos.
---
Yeah, there is a machine at train stations that you can 'sell' your unwanted legendary items to for a currency called scrip. You can sell 150 worth of scrip items per 24 hours. You max out at 1000 scrip. You can spend this scrip at the Rusty Pick in the Ash Heap (down south in the blackened area of the map) for legendary armor, weapons and modules. But that is a bit later in the game for you. 
---
I'd suggest just trying to enjoy it and after level 25 you might find events and stuff not quite as threatening. I haven't taken my level 13 out since the update yet, so am unsure how much more difficult it is now, if at all.
---
Oh, sorry, I misinterpreted what you were saying. I was thinking you meant I would be happy I wouldn't be wasting bullets because I wouldn't have to constantly make them, wasting time and resources doing that instead of fighting. If that makes sense.
---
Anyway, my overall point: why does it take 2 shots to kill enemy #1 and 2 shots to kill enemy #6 when I should be dealing 60% more damage due to the adrenaline perk. Why is it, when I take off my all my damage perk cards, it went up to 3 shots to kill something? There's a problem in that.
---
"You can now *hold* block."  
---
üòªü§§üòª
---
It was an existing bug, I assume you ran into the same. Sometimes it happens to miss all your vats shots even if its 95% all, but if you quit vats like after the first shot when this happens and enter again, it works properly.
---
I've just got some really good weapons I like to use now and then and my stash is full of other weapons im going to set another mule up for me primary weapon try to keep like 3 on me at a time. And dump everything on to that  character and just swap stuff I want on a morning.
---
No. The basic fundamental principal 
---
 behind console certs is that EVERYTHING that passes through needs to get approval first. The only time that you will ever see a hotfix that doesn't go through cert is if it's server side and doesn't require a client/console side update.
---
I have been wanting these things, great minds! Since I first picked up the chainsaw I wanted to make a build around it, sadly as soon as I found one they patched the over repair bug that increased the damage.... give the chainsaw some love. I also currently have your #1 and #2 as builds on 2 of my characters right now no joke. My plague spreader is actually a squad healer, and my pyro maniac only uses a flamer and throwables.
---
Or beg someone who has it.
---
I really like it, has snappy quick animations that you can fast exit from. How every other work bench or buff furniture should be really. 
---
Sophia seems to love it too.
---
Shes always hopping in it.
---
Need to find a means to get a cycled light inside of it. Wiring is an issue tho.
---
So long as the characters body can sit inside the middle it will still work with objects merged in with the slop trick.
---
Has alot of potential for some great mad scientist set pieces with it.
---
At a low level, I'd stick around the lower level events.  There's one about Fertilizer near the responder town and Collion Course at the 1st airport the game guides you to.  When I was doing the Fertilizer event, it allowed you to log out and log back in to repeat the event.  I also put my 1st camp in the Summerville lake area to clear the Summervilke town over and over.  Clear, log out and enemies respawn.  Collect and scrap the armor and weapons to unlock plans.  The town has workbenches to scrap items.
---
As you gain levels, then move up to clearing West Tek.  It is full up mutants that respawn every time you log in.  It is way more challenging that Summerville.
---
You can join public "casual" teams for a little extra xp on everything.  If someone on the publuc team is a high level, you could go to events they do.  You will die a good bit like Campfire Tales, but should benefit from xp if event is completed.
---
There are vending machines at all train stations which take legendary items with stars and give you ‚Äúscrip‚Äù. You then take these scrip to the rusty pick in the ash heap to gamble them for better legendary items. You can pick like if you want a melee or ranged item, etc, and how many stars it will have, but the legendary effects from each star are random.
---
Yeh, I have alcohol, buffout, psycho, daddy-o and mentats, they also have minimal effect on your specials.
---
My favorite are... letters.
---
I'm on pc and if you don't get one I will be on in a few hours and can give you one.
---
Ive seen it happen to the settler wanderer too- just happens every once in a while and will be that way for a while. 
---
Give her a junkies 10mm and enjoy the added defensive bonus
---
Yes and I hate it. Real life is hard enough; don‚Äôt need my games to kick my ass like that now too. Probably not gonna play it anymore.
---
&gt;The B.E.T.A. test was a lie, their game was already 'finished' and ready to ship. 
---
Also you...
---
&gt;Nah, you can't strawman for Bethesda
---
You're lack of self awareness is painful.
---
How many families of addictions where there? Like is buftats separate from mentats and buftout, or would it supress both?
---
For steel, equip the scraper perk and scrap enemy weapons. My favorite hotspot is the uranium fever event, and I pick everything up off corpses. Scrap the guns with the perk for steel, sell the glowing meat and blood and use the ammo
---
People sell junk actually u should just hop servers and check camps
---
Max out Demolition Expert to gain more damage
---
Thank you so much!
---
I've got a ET SS war glaive yesterday not so good though
---
Are you ps4? What junk do you need I can either give or help you get it for free.
---
I always do the fairgrounds at the the top left of the map for screws and junk, and morgan town high school is good for plastic and junk too.
---
Daily ops team for up to 4x daily ops xp.
---
Events for 4x event xp 
---
Casual can add up to 4 intelligence IIRC which gets you extra xp overall.
---
Hunting I think is extra legendary xp.
---
I switch between casual, daily ops and events depending on what I‚Äôm doing
---
I saw what I‚Äôm assuming was your camp once and was blown away! Thanks for the tutorial!
---
1. They work as described. Up to 4 members with each member boosting the bonus the team type provides(4 people in a casual team -&gt; +4 intelligence for everyone on the team)
---
2. It's junk(heh)
---
3. Most people don't buy plans they already have and are only after legendary weapons/armor
---
4. You can play them to get a better feeling of how they work and how you should move ect. Just run from marker to marker and do what the quest tells you to do(upper right corner). Don't bother fighting(unless the quest tells you to) and strictly go for the objective since it's all timed. If you complete the op in less than 8 minutes, you get the full reward.
---
5. Then let it move fast, everyone started small. You will get a better grip, understanding and feeling of the game, the longer you play it \^\^
---
6. Just collect EVERYTHING. Every bucket, every glue and every damn wood scrap. Break these things down at workbenches and store them.
---
If you're on pc i can even give you some items \^\^
---
Amusing when your assumption of the competence of a AAA game dev is unable to add/remove a simple flag from an item without breaking an entirely unrelated system. I mean I am not saying you are wrong, its just funny.
---
If Bethesda was your car mechanic you would be like, man, I am having this problem with my blinker staying on after I turn, but I don't want him to mess with it because the wheels might fall off.
---
Bird bones and marsupial are a must, wouldn‚Äôt play any other way
---
Yeah and I get that, it was waaayyy overbalanced before the update, bloodied was OP and this update brought it down and made the game more challenging.
---
Not saying this update is balanced yet either, it needs some tweaking that's for sure but it is a step in the right direction.
---
 Bethesda needs to address non auto/pistols/ bows/crossbows etc.. maybe increase their damage output or their associated perks to make them more inline with the auto/heavy and make those builds viable once more.
---
I get that not all enemies should be able to be one shotted but a sniper should be able to aim for the head and insta kill certain enemies that way. Atm non auto just gets swamped by enemies in groups
---
This made me laugh lol 4 sec on a steak!?  XD
---
I found a player camp like this near the site of meat week while it was going on. Is it easy to move and put down again?
---
Would only suppress buffout family I think
---
 The symbol should be " ‚â§ "
---
Higher level players are always willing to help peeps in a bind. Ask around and find someone who can lend an assist. 
---
I regularly repair the armor and weapons of the friends I run with for them.
---
Or can even share the max repair perk if they're leery about handing over their best gear, should we not be that close and arent trust worthy enough for them yet.
---
PaladinCiel on xbox.
---
Public teams are a bit meh depending on what u wanna do I.e casual, events and so on u get a single buff with each category like events u get bonus xp 
---
No one sells junk because they need it lol if u go white springs majority of the venders in there sell junk a bit expensive but u can get most junk if not all 
---
People probably have the plans u have
---
Daily ops are recommended level 50 and it‚Äôs only one game mode for it at the moment called uplink my advice is join a public team and it will say if one of them starts a daily op so if ur on console press start and on the bottom left it will give u directions on how to proceed but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend until u hit level 50 or have a good build otherwise u will die a lot
---
As for springs gears and such google it there‚Äôs a few good places don‚Äôt get me wrong u will be lucky to get a 100 but it‚Äôs better than a kick in the teeth steal I go to the top of the world there‚Äôs some cans hanging around and then to the amusement park at the bottom left of the map and there‚Äôs a few more cans there 
---
Someone may have a better spot than me
---
Hope this helps bud
---
I missed a mini nuke on a robobrain. Didn‚Äôt even explode or anything either.
---
Bugs?
---
In fallout 76?
---
Never
---
I have both and you just need to be careful with some of those blind leaps you might make when in a mad rush to get from A to B.   Further if you are a bloodied build you really do need to watch even seemingly mild jumps.    Now if you happen to have a jet pack you can feather the throttle for it and take a great deal out of whatever impact you may have.
---
Your prices isnt hign at all! But generally if u put very common plan in your vendor and the people who already now the plan wont buy it. If u want people to come ur vendor u should have a lot of item on either ammo, junk, weapon, armor etc. As for prices u can check other camp vendors for example
---
Ah its based on the first name of the combination?
---
So my psychobuff would be for psycho an not buftout?
---
If only there was a prime automatic barrel... Bethesda only implemented the rifleman barrel as prime.
---
Unyielding. Always. If you have survivability issues, look at your perks (use perks that give damage reduction instead of damage resistance) or get 3\* armor with the 15% damage reduction while sprinting/standing still/blocking effects.
---
Thanks a lot for the advice! :)
---
That can actually be seen as a good thing. While more balance adjustments could be made to overall damage and the leveling curves of enemies, I think making perk choices more difficult is an improvement. Previously, most people focused only on damage perks, and "food builds" were being looked down upon.
---
I understand why some people will add fluff to theirs. If you see someone with 30 weapons you think / hope it's a mule with a bunch of stuff and maybe some good deals. If you see someone (like myself) with say, 3 weapons and 2 armor pieces listed, you probably think it's not worth going after. Even though many times it's the opposite that's true. 
---
It'd be nice if we could at least get more details on what people have. If I could see that your 10 weapons are all 1 star legendaries, I'm still going to check it out. Might be a good deal for scrip etc.
---
Same here. Couldn't even talk to him before level 50 mole rats finished him off
---
It's been like that for me since I came back in July after not playing for a few months.
---
I have both and i love it. Also i have max class freak perk so :)
---
I carry a 2lb fatman and a 2lb missle launcher around because I used to always end up with mini nukes and missiles, and I would rather fire them off than drop them. Sometimes they actually help, lol.
---
If you're on PS4 I've got ammo. I can make guns. It'll.cost you some time but that's it
---
I actually got an IE lever rifle last night. 2-3 shots took down a level 100 super mutant
---
Source?
---
Is part of the fun. Cant ever be sure that that person with just 3 has 3 god roles for an affordable price, or rare event plans.
---
Yeh
---
\- PA glitch to get past the laser grid is patched (as far as i know)  
---
\- pa glitch to pass locked doors/walls etc. , is still activ ....   
---
Its very frustrating if u try your first Silo Run and out of nothere and do the "express way" ...that happend a couple of times to me
---
Most illuminating.
---
What console are you on?
---
You are a tad low level to be doing daily ops, believe the recommended build is at least 50. 
---
Best thing I can advise is try to make friends.  A few high levels probably could carry you thru a daily op.
---
Make sure to complete your score dailies every day. They do reward some material kits.
---
Take over one of the two junk yard workshops. Use a junk extractor. Also spend atoms on a collectron. These guys literally go find junk for you and are a quality of life buy.
---
If your on Xbox look me up. I might be able to help you some. Gamertag is the same. 
---
Also always pay it forward when you can
---
It also takes up so much space for now gain in power output, not worth it to me atm
---
Ad victoriam
---
If they made the instanced area something like vault 88, then I don't think it should be too much trouble. They'd probably have to make it a bit smaller though.
---
Vats is nothing without the 'penetrator' perk from fo4. Where your shots can go through cover at reduced damage. It might be in the code but I miss vats shots if something gets in the way. It could be any object that can block a bullet.
---
Maybe I'm waiting for that bond to max out.
---
Junkies is hot shit imo, I love mine and really don't see any difference.. Choose your addcitions based on your build to, for example I don't want to much of a hit on agility because of blocker, or endurance as I like a lot of health.
---
Every build you say. With that whole, sneak doesn't work thing. Every build huh?
---
In very extreme cases possibly. During my time in this game (\~2500h) never had the "game freeze" or "rollback" happen to me. And if i understand and remember correctly they changed how and when items are saved to the characters from early months of the game. Back then it was possible to lose items very easily to game crashing.
---
I‚Äôd definitely abandon my cliffside camp to make one. They‚Äôd have to really balance the number of indoor camps though, due to traffic. No one ever camps where I do, which is a good thing.
---
Damage formula for energy weapons was fixed. Those guns are a lot more effective now. Did you try one after patch 22?
---
oh man, sadly, I don't think they'll do that
---
If you want to use a instigating lever action you should get rid of the explosive prefix.   If you fire into groups yes you will hit that first target hard but any damage from the explosive effect that hits nearby targets damages them and instigating no longer applies.
---
I was using the same kind of weapon at one point and another user pointed the same thing out to me and it was very beneficial to switch to another weapon.
---
It's adorable you think they'd have fixed it even if it was found on the PTS. Feedback isn't really listened to, besides the whole "some people don't want to sell their animated cards" thing, so they made their cost the same as the rest, making the terrible grind even worse.
---
Still, with how common they are you don‚Äôt really need an unbreakable one
---
With one wasteland you can technically have 30 additional perk pts to give you all the qol and damage perks you'll ever need. Need to grind for it though like everything else in this game. 
---
Casual away!
---
No, it has been like this for months but no one would believe, so here it is and it is not going anywhere, same as fast traveling bugs. They are busy by nerfing stuff.
---
Yes, exactly. Honestly, I don't want to be a tank. I  don't want to kill the queen in 2 minutes. I want to be the rogue of the group, and there should be a place for that. Prior to this patch, I invested a lot to be THAT for my team, but now I'm just a liability.
---
I developed a tactic with my perception rifle/revolver style to throw then vats shoot my grenade. Surprisingly effective
---
**Get oneshot by the enemy who had a 6% to hit**
---
Respectfully disagree, that is a poor comparison.. Everyone has the option to make their own team and manage the players so if I make a team for my friends and take it public to get the bonus, I'm sorry you're getting bumped when I need to make room for one of my friends. That's why there is a team leader after all.
---
I will of course politely give a heads up over the mic, I'm not an animal. And I agree with OP, bumping someone from an OPS TEAM while in a daily ops is rude.... But to say we shouldn't be bumping people from public teams, that's just not accurate.
---
You have to have a disease for it to work, and it also does nearly no damage. It's functionally pointless. 
---
Also it can trigger friendly npc damage etc iirc, though that may have been fixed.
---
Selling junk used to be a big thing before Fallout 1st when you had to store it in your main stash. I suspect a lot of people at least grabbed it for just a month or two and filled the Scrap Box up with as much junk as possible since you can still use it, but not add to it, after cancelling Fallout 1st. You still find junk, but no where near as much as a year ago, and usually much more expensive than it used to be.
---
Do the high airtime have an effect combat?
---
Does it need a tesla?
---
I was testing trying new weapons out and while shooting with a 50 called the health went down.... then it was full again then it went down and bounced around and around.
---
I learned ticks do not like fire. Hope that helps
---
I quite like the Moleminer exp run through Welch and up to the railroad yard. Gets a ton on weapons to sell to get that daily cap limit.
---
I think hitting up all the supermutant spots nets you the highest exp though.
---
I‚Äôd love to see it, no lie.
---
Server hopping at West tek
---
Thanks for letting me know , I played for a good 4 hours yesterday and I got how the character building works!
---
Strange thing is the fertilizer grenades can be taken by other players
---
This isn't new.
---
Love the 10mm
---
Is anyone else having it skip the rewards screen from here and going straight to the loading screen? It's happens the past two days for me.
---
Only if it‚Äôs not yours.
---
First of all, the process for getting into PA and how photomode works are not true glitches.  They are working as intended.  If you couldn't phase into power armour then you wouldn't be able to get into it 90% of time because of a rock, tree, bush, etc.  The same with the photomode camera, it needs to be able to phase through things.  
---
For most of us, the fact that you can use these to make it easier to launch a Nuke is a nice side effect.  Not everyone has 30 to 45 minutes just to spend on launching a Nuke.  However, like most things, it can also be used by jerks to be, well... jerks...
---
I think that the best way to fix this would be to have an option on entering to "Allow any other player to assist", "Allow only team members", "Allow Friends", or "This is a solo run".  Perhaps an option in a terminal just before the laser grids.  This would reset if you leave the Silo for any reason.
---
I don't know if it solves the fundamental problem with the non autos right now (e.g. my BE and IE levers take 2 to 3 shots to kill an enemy when the BE should be the superior gun), but you are right. I'll pull out my normal instigating tomorrow and take it for a spin.
---
I shall upvote when I can then!
---
A goof idea might be to invest in melee perks untill you can get a steady supply of ammo because your going to be bringing through ammo untill you have some gun related perks
---
Don‚Äôt worry social life is fine for me. Got a family and nice friends, a job and working for a non profit Organisation that helps homeless animals that‚Äôs similar to hope for CC
---
And still I can say fallout 76 attracts to much whiners because of the kids mechanics. We had pvp lite at the beginning and it got nerved because of whiners. Now a camp gets destroyed... this takes two... 2... klicks to rebuild... and still tears...  flee, fight or rebuild...  but no... players now life in a bubble and they want to decide how interactions should be but they can‚Äôt... and now you try to take a game and the behaviors of GAMERS into the real
---
world. And this shows how you wage your Game (to much). This shows that you need a better real life so that a game has less weight in your life.
---
I do the same. If it's to good to be true like 95% you'll miss 4 times in a row. Back out and in and it says like 35% and you hit.
---
Should be working now. Please tell me, if there are some issues.
---
&gt;Ya, had people selling it in bulk for for less than 1 cap a piece in some of the trade groups I am in and that made it difficult for me to sell mine at 1 cap a piece but was not gonna lower it bc I spent time farming the mats to craft it instead of cheating.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been doing it with all sorts
---
Meh.
---
Freezing floater grenades can be pretty badass for scorchbeast queen making it fly through the air very slow right above you allowing you to unload on it.
---
You just got it hit with them while it's landed though. Then its practically still in the air.
---
Use them both, one procs at 40% health the other at 25% health. Both a must for high health imo.
---
It should be possible now. Please tell me, if there are still some issues with copying it.
---
It‚Äôs what the game was before they coddled people on reddit and neutered PvP, still fun to engage in on occasion if someone leaves themselves open for it.
---
Every hour, on the hour it reset.
---
It's entirely dependent on RNG. The only bloody anything I've ever seen has been Gatling lasers and and melee weapons.
---
Also, I think bloodied builds are fucking stupid, and I'm not going to waste my time speccing into something that's probably going to be nerfed into the dirt because it's behaving in a way that's unintended.
---
Yea this happened to me. It‚Äôs super annoying
---
I like Earle, the bigger they are right.
---
Good shot though, I like it.

Ah, some intel on Foundation! Let‚Äôs see here... a lake? Uh, ok. Oh, there‚Äôs another! It‚Äôs just Page, blankly staring at the camera.
---
The Super Reactor, so much bigger than the Fusion Generator, but the same output? Pointless.  
---
I really don't see the point of using the SR, and unless it gets buffed, I'll stick with my FR's.
---
I feel your loss... no, wait, I don't cause I still have mine!  (joke)

Bit dramatic. How do you "set foot" in a game anyway?
---
He'll be back.
---
FyI you can sink it into a floor and build foundations around it, so it doesn't look as massive, I have a nice neat reactor room now.
---
I totally agree this needs to be fixed asap. Had this happen multiple times now myself. It seems to come back every time I gain SCORE after joining a server. Only "workaround" I found so far is that opening the score board seems to prevent it from happening again for some time but you still have to go through all your Score ranks once which takes some minutes of constant popups and annoying sound.
---
All my memories
---
What i do is screenshot them and upload to my OneDrive. I got around 200ish all stored there
---
Honestly I've seen more posts of people asking about it than posts saying it's back. I wouldn't worry too much.
---
Wendigos is still good
---
Full PA with bulletshield perk and weapon trait. Aslong as you keep firing you are untouchable. Burns alot of ammo though...
---
Yeah, a while back I fought a blood eagle who had a 50. Cal, which was the weapon I really wanted, and he ended up dropping a pipe rifle
---
So I got the notification for that long reply you did, but I can't actually see it here or reply to it, no idea what's up with that lol so I'll reply here  
---
You're obviously very passionate about the topic lol, I do disagree though because I don't mind if different content is more challenging for different builds as long as its still possible. I actually like the idea of more content that gives different player builds chances to shine. Maybe one day my food build will come in handy at an actual Grahm Cookout daily op or something lmao  
---
I do agree not being able to trade most new weapons or armor, or upgrade them for friends or strangers is really really dumb.  I do get why they would want to gate certain equipment off to incentivize players to do the quests, story missions, and reputation grinds, but I see no reason to continue the restriction to players that have earned them. I feel like it'd be better to be able to drop, trade, and sell these items but have it so players who haven't done the requirements to get them simply be unable to see them in item lists, rather than having the items unable to be traded period.  
---
Changing Engines would be a really fucking stupid idea. You'd have the same damn bugs on top of new ones. The issue isn't the Engine, it's the fact that they haven't bothered to fix the bugs that their games have had since Morrowind. If they just moved everything to another engine, those bugs would still be there, along with shitloads more from the transfer of scripts, assets, etc. The engine is fine, and hopefully they do continue to improve it, but if that happens it won't be with this game lol, this game was their experiment with adding multiplayer capabilities to their engine. That's not a defense at all, nor is it a burn, it's just what this game is lol. I believe they plan to use what they've learned to add in some multiplayer functionality in their future games, like possibly whatever their space lookin game they're working on turns out to be. IF actual engine fixes do happen, and that's a big "IF" I know lol, then it won't happen in Fallout 76, it'll be with their next mainline game. Maybe these fixes will be backported to FO76 but prolly not.   
---
All the other bugs you mentioned with like the weapons and armor stuff not working, ya that's bullshit for sure and you should be pissed off lol  
---
But despite all its flaws, fo76 is one of the chillest multiplayer games to play imo. It doesn't have to be serious gamer time all the time lol. I play other "good" games, but most of my hours still are in fo76 just because it's a fun world to play around in, the writing is compelling, and there's tons of shit to see and collect that doesn't involve spending money, similar to most Bethesda games.  
---
Could the game be better? fuck yea ohmygod why do they make the decisions they do?  
---
but idk I haven't seen any game offer a similar experience to a bethesda game that did the job better, yea I'm a sucker for bullshit but it's fun to bullshit lol, if game=fun then it good game is my logic :P  
---
but yea I also recognize that most stuff that I enjoy in a videogame, you don't give a shit about, probably works both ways haha   
---
Unless you also enjoy shit like Kenshi and Divinity OS2, then I dunno what TF is going on, tastes are weird and complex lol
---
Sadly not, no. The gun has no silencer mod and is quite the attention-getter. It does make up for that drawback with a satisfyingly high damage output and great VATS performance, though.
---
How this not very flashed out suggestion got 1,6k upvotes, while mine got -1 is ... wierd ...
---
Whatever, yes Dual Wielding should be a thing for Pistols and One Handed Melee (not unarmed).

Equip strange in number card and it will make you jump even higher

Overly sensitive looney gets their feelings hurt by a simple joke, then writes a letter about it.

You're lucky, 3 days in a row...nothing, then caged lights then..nothing, all Elder level :-)

The only NPC I‚Äôve seen react to me differently is Blackeye, the fish monger who takes Mirelurk meat for rep. She starts out terse but now greets me as her favorite supplier and sometimes gives *me* gifts.

Every other daily quest NPC just never changes their reaction, but she does.

Fancy Pump Action Shotgun

Most of them bought cheap from vending machines

What lvl are you

I've been super lucky there, got the plans on my first daily op. It's now standing in the bathroom, because it somewhat looks like a shower.
---
I came back to my camp today to find her floating like a T posed Jesus over my pool, shit was trippy
---
32
---
You become your own lookout tower. :-D Jump up, turn around in flight and spam the VATS button to find mobs that are obscured by vegetation or structures.
---
It also helps with not killing yourself with explosive weapons.
---
ETA: I definitely recommend having 2 armor pieces with the fall damage reduction legendary perk, though.
---
Invest in damage reduction perks, i solo'd the raids in the burning mine and Vault 94.
---
Yes the radiation barrel is from RR, but the question was for the emitter which is the trap version.
---
No problem. I tried to make it as easy to understand as possible without making it too long.
---
impressive :)
---
Good gear or acceptable gear
---
No. If you move your camp then you have to rebuild it completely  from scratch.
---
I'm lvl 215 and i'm a bloodied heavy guns super tank build patch 22 hasn't effected be much. I use T 60 PA with protocol and nerd rage and my legacys. No its not a garbage B E GP either i hate the gp my legacys are a Q E gat lazer, B E Flamer, and a queen busting m2 HMG and i have every mutation in the game besides egg head, twisted muscles, and herbivore. I feel that i'm too OP when using the Q E gat lazer because if you use power user 3 you'll have 4k shots in a single core i can solo a ops and use maybe 3 cores in total and i'm stupidly tanky at 15% hp i haven't been downed once since the patch now i take that back i did die once but it was my own fault i wasn't in my pa at my camp and was adding a new floor in a rad storm and fell two stories at 2% hp and died but thats a self death not a combat related death. But anyways i play ps4 so if you want too play together hit me up my psn tag is XGNsharpshot21
---
Bad
---
Was so happy to get this perk.     Saves up a lot of card space and the auto pick is awesome
---
When Colossal problem pops, go there, people always open lunchboxes, usually at least 4. Do that event, it's almost a guaranteed level up. When you have finished run around West Tek and Whitespring a couple times while you still have the 100% XP boosts. I level up 4 times in one session doing that.
---
Your reply is nonexistent. Strawman
---
We are done here.
---
I somewhat agree. As a casual scrub I've been forced to rethink some perks, like removing glow sight for tank killer. Also deleting what seemed like a never ending list of useless perk cards. The survival shortcut perk is probably my favourite, I was carrying 150 lbs of water and that was with thru hiker.
---
That's unfortunate, i don't think i got any low level gear lying around. Are you on xbox rn?
---
Ye
---
Great advice. I'll give this a try next time the event pops, thanks
---
Thank you.
---
Its ok buddy üëç
---
I read tank killer now works for pistols as of patch 22, that should help quite a bit since AA is now one of the best perks for damage.
---
Post on Beth forums and file a ticket
---
Thing that‚Äôs annoying me at the moment is when I get score points it goes back through every level, levelling them up until I‚Äôm back where I was. Logging out and logging in doesn‚Äôt even fix it
---
I just use the armor which has the -50% falling damage times 2. I then dont have a need for bird bones. Sadly I am too clumsy for marsupial.
---
I use bird bones and marsupial and I could jump down from the top of my camp all the way down with very little health drop. I'm at 30% all the time and lose maybe 5%, when you see my camp you'll find it an acceptable loss cuz it's high.
---
hotfixes ARE server sided AND don't require an update for the game itself 
---
they're pulled from the servers everytime you start up the game 
---
but UPDATES DO have to go through console certs
---
Level 15 is where enemy health starts going fucking nuts.
---
When you hit level 23, enemies will have 3 times as much health as they do right now, as well as more armour, so their effective health is going to be something like 4 or 5 times as high as it is right now.
---
It's the biggest problem with one wasteland: Enemy durability vastly outpaces the ability of the player to deal damage.
---
In the meantime, merge weapon cards like automatic and non automatic into one category just like heavy weapons, plus the rifle weight perk, and some fries please.
---
Is it actually hella rare I jus sold mine
---
Solution: make whoever joins an Op team leader. They then won't be kicked and can kick whoever doesn't join to open slots. No point in being in a team if you're not participating in the teams goal.
---
Good job! Thank you!

I got i Bloody one that i dont need. If I still got it. Xbox?

Survival shortcut legendary perk. Saw it recommended by another redditor. I use rank 1 and it gives me a survival stimpak roughly every half hour. Takes away the need to eat or drink to boost those pesky bars.
---
I've found out they are better have not a clue what your on about my 50 ball pistol using vats on their head to instakill
---
This. Use 3-5 different weapons and you will have never problems with ammo. At low level I used all my 308 and well... already had about 200 shotgun shells...
---
You dont need a meta build of any sort. I dont. I have a mix of QOL perks and some damage buff perks for the weapon type I use and some perks that deal with incoming damage and with only a very few exceptions am doing just fine. I have another friend witha  non meta build whose experience is similar. Both of us feel if anything we are a tiny bit stronger with the change. Think about what you need perks to do and adapt and adjust accordingly.
---
Killed a raider.     In armour.    He had a Gatling gun.   I got a frigging pistol.
---
It's the first freezing one I've tried. I joined it half way through with a team, they were around level 50-70 and struggling badly. Final time was 27 mins!
---
I got curious and dusted off my instigating explosive railway, holy cow, I am one shotting everything, no crits needed wtf, if only the ammo wasn‚Äôt  so damn heavy üò©
---
Only 7, tho yeah both mutations are very good. Just use class freak because the downside is terrible for my build at least
---
I make a team, and sit in it. When it hits 3 people I enter the op, then wait for the rest.
---
If its two of us, and the other guy is confident, he can fire it up and ill follow, but I won't be first in, unless we have 3+.
---
I think you are the first established player that I have seen actually aknowledge that starting a new character to try the levelling is flawed because you already know the game inside out. You can't simply unlearn all that knowledge so of course it is going to be easier. Genuinely thanks for that! 
---
I have only been playing for about two weeks (if that). Until two days ago I had no clue that underarmor was a thing. Seems obvious now I do know but it really did not occur to me. I got my first costume shortly after leaving the vault. Saw that my jumpsuit had the same 'non stats' so assumed that you replaced one with the other. Looted a peice of armor and equipped it and thought I knew the system. I don't recall reading anything in game telling me different so I moved on. 
---
My point (other than to show how clueless I can be sometimes) is that traditionally the levelling experience is the very place where you are supposed to learn these things. Make stupid mistakes, learn from them and grow. Ordinarily the game is more forgiving to allow you to do this. Certainly you are right in that the XP boost means that you won't have suffer at low levels for as long if you can push through the slog. I have gone from 24 to 30 in a day or so. However it will mean that you will get a whole lot of players at level 50+ who simply have not had the time (or the safety net) to learn the basic systems of the game.
---
I have a quad version also but haven't used it yet, I better give it a try üëç
---
How long does it take the bond to max? I feel like it will finish before the Op does, right?
---
I always get 200+ screws doing the wendigo colossus event
---
Possibly, but all good things come to those that wait.
---
I don't swap characters, I only play my main but this happened to me 3 times already. However, I use the Gauss shotgun as well, don't know if it is of any significance.
---
Really nice photo. Anyways, nowadays very rare to get people nuking the mines, so it's become even harder to get a good pic
---
My C.A.M.P thing you put down. Have disappeared in my camp, I can't itüòÖ
---
Well i had that mutation by accident and i thought it doesnt have any effect and i didnt recover it. 
---
BUT recently i earn symptomatic plan and i build it at my camp i had a disease at that time and it didnt recover when i use symptomatic. Then i finally manage to recover from plague walker mutation and use symptomatic again then i recovered from disease.
---
Well im not %100 sure but it is what it is
---
Whats the legendary effect?
---
Why‚Äôd you get downvoted? That‚Äôs funny.
---
ALL notifications NEED to be on the SIDE of the FUCKING screen.
---
WHY IS THIS SHIT ON YOUR FACE??
---
I posted about this on day 2 of release. Bethesda, get your shit together.
---
are you selling it? if so how much? currently have 10k caps kindly message me if you're thinking of selling it. ^_^
---
This game was pretty much built upon glitches and exploits.If they were able to fix everything to where you had to do everything the appropriate way 75% of the players would quit the game.Why?Because those people are lazy and or impatient.
---
two shot
---
tip: take over a workshop that has steel and lead
---
My alts original build was a bloodied sniper build but I've had to amend that to a commando ( for now) just to survive after the update, luckily I had these changes in place prior to it happening because I took and listened to the advice given by the PTS members of what's going down.
---
I've faired better than some people so I'm grateful for that, I'm holding my own and contributing to any team I'm with ( especially during daily ops). Yeah I'm more squishy now but I expected that tbh.
---
This update is about adapting for now till a new meta is found or  possible changes to weapons making existing builds viable again
---
Does it even count as sniping if it isn't even aiming at you when it somehow kills you?
---
Level matching worked in ESO but it doesn't work in a game where everything you are looking crafting is scarce enough as it is. The constant shooting at these ridiculous bullet sponges now causes weapons and armor to break even quicker (Armor because of getting our rears smashed in but unrelenting bullet sponges). If this is what you intended on doing in order to prolong the gameplay then this was not a step in the right direction. We'll spend most of our time scrounging for lead to make ammo only to have burned through it in the next zone for a single mission. Might as well go full melee build now because my guns are useless and stealth....LMAO!! Forget that. My stealth build as well as bloody builds are obsolete.  
---
So we've got three options now. Weak as hell bloody build, heavy gun build that does little damage because everything just sucks those up, and finally, the melee build....because I always feel like beating the crap out of something with a boxing glove or mole miner glove....OH and don't forget the AMAZING Super Sledge. Yup, it's going to make the game seem longer that's for sure but definitely not enjoyable. 
---
This does not make new players want to stay. Enemy level scaling only works in games that aren't revolving around the constant shortage of things like lead or acid. I'm still playing, but I've got quite a few friends that are dropping like flies and I'm just curious what the future plans are regarding this. I'm sure I'm not the only person who thinks this scaling thing was a bad idea.
---
We need perks for gathering loot in abundance so that we can have the amount of bullets to kill these things or you need to roll back this scaling update. But keep in mind, the ability to kill things in one shot made stealth kills more believable and to be perfectly honest, if I'm in a wasteland full of things like these creatures, why in the hell would I ever get up on them? Stay the distance, one shot to the dome, move on. 
---
Am I the only one experiencing issues with this new bullet sponge update?
---
It says that damage but it probably can‚Äôt kill a radroach lmao
---
Money, it's always money.
---
You talking about the op? Why insult him and call him a psycho? That‚Äôs rude to be true...
---
I‚ÄôM GONNA SHOW YOU HOW UNCLE SAM DEALS WITH COMMIE MAGGOTS!
---
i havent played since like, beta/early days out of beta , and i have 1 question
---
what the fuck is this
---
Perk cards are probably the key here.  Gun-fu, Adrenalin etc.  You need all the cards that raise damage on next hit.
---
They're decent but just weigh me the fuck down way too much
---
You could only trade things for 1000 caps because every duper had 8 million of them in their inventory and the game was insanely unstable and crashed all the time.
---
Values are almost back to how they were intended to be now, and the bloodied nerf/rebalance means everything that isn't BE is suddenly worthwhile again. It's great
---
3 piece TS and born survivor / serendipity / first aid perks. Nuka Quantum on hotkey for "oh shit" moments. Tanking ALL the bots all day long.
---
Let's not forget this is an RPG so putting a bit of thought in your build is required. I don't think casual players will necessarily get overwhelmed, it's not that difficult to choose perks. Most casuals will just think damage perks are needed and will equip them anyway.
---
Its tedious, but I learned to do this on my archer character and I literally do this now every time I use VATS.  
---
SUPERB game design.
---
This bug is the sole reason I ditched my magic shotgun and respecced into heavy guns
---
&gt;IMO, there needs to be a good set with at least 7 or more items in it as a Bundle. I'll decide for myself if I want everything in it or not. I'm not swimming in Atoms.
---
I am not sure what you meant here.  But If you meant that bundles should allow you to pick 4-5 things out of pool of 7 items, then I am 100% on board.  
---
&gt; The food and drinks provide better buffs when made with the cauldron.
---
I don't like the idea of paying atoms/real money for any sort of in game advantage.  For cosmetics it's fine, but going beyond that would be predatory ~~behavior~~ game design for those OCD gamers that can't deal with lesser buffs.  Yes, it's possible to earn in game atoms, but the rate that we can earn them now is so slow that it would still trigger compulsion in many to buy atoms for this pay to win dev strategy.
---
Others have found the way!
---
Make sure you do the settlers quests up to the point of no return (it will tell you when this is with a pop up) as you get a really expensive item/s that will otherwise cost you a lot of gold bullion
---
Yup 'thesda needs to get on that shit asap
---
When you learn the plan then the purveyor will drop them.
---
Handmade... And a .44 as a sniper xD. But the revolver does some good damage... Just slow af
---
Yes, I learned the symptomatic and got two more the next day
---
Edit: why I am getting down voted? I am only answering the question? üôÑ
---
I have it - it‚Äôs trash.  Does no damage to mobs, just turns them slightly green!
---
No.
---
I thought of this too. It would be interesting to see a questline involving the Blue Ridge Co.
---
Problem is still condition though, my auto gls barely make it through a daily op starting at 200% durability. I do carry multiple on me, but its still annoying. The fat man and missile launcher break even faster.
---
If you want to get a bit more mileage out of a grenade launcher that isn't quite one-shotting things, you can chuck a grenade at their feet before firing, the gl explosion will set off the regular grenade for a double whammy.
---
The funny thing is that it would be the best way to combat mass duped legacies, weapons, armor.  
---
The punch line is that they can't manage to even figure out how to prevent duping...  
---
It's one of those *not-actually-funny* kinda jokes.
---
 Nope, I can still kill everything just fine with my level 50 gear. Higher level gear would be pointless
---
Definitely saw the same.  At first I thought it was because I was doing melee or combat was too quick feom just moving ariund too much if over run.  
---
So last night I went somewhere I could use my sniper rifle and take my time so I could really pay attention and sure enough...vats 95%, carefully let off 4 shots, missed all 4.  Range was more than adequate.
---
I stuck mine in a tree to save on room.
---
https://i.imgur.com/CxBALWv.jpg
---
Perhaps your build needs optimized.
---
I only find that what needed 1 bullet before now needs 3.
---
Sorry were on Xbox (come on Bethesda! Let's get cross play!) 
---
I appreciate the offer though this community is one of a kind (other than animal crossing. So I guess two of a kind.)
---
Bloodied still has the highest damage potential. The gaps have just gotten smaller between the different effects
---
It looks cool though.
---
I was just gearing up to start a berserker built aswell.
---
Why does it look like a face though haha
---
I thought there was some good advice on the Fed76 website which was to max out damage once to see what it‚Äôs like and then scale it back to what‚Äôs really necessary, replacing damage or damage-mitigation related perks with QOL or whatever.
---
Then you can find the balance that works for you.
---
I also think the perk load out has to be fluid depending on the situation so really there is no one ideal build. Swapping perks is a chore for me but has become second nature now. 
---
Unfortunately a lot of the game is damage related , like you can‚Äôt use charisma to talk the sbq down over a coffee and explain that what it‚Äôs doing is annoying people and can it please stop.
---
Will do thanks
---
On a related note, does the name Dorsey have any history in Fallout lore? I noticed that in addition to this guy, the renegade family in Wasteland 3, a game which owes much to Fallout, are called the Dorseys. Coincidence or are they both referencing some earlier Fallout character?
---
r/cringetopia
---
Exactly......
---
Exact opposite for me. 
---
Patch 22 has pretty much ended my daily obsession with Appalachia.
---
Level 116 and suddenly my 2 main weapons, both 3 star, are virtually worthless. I can survive, have plenty of resources to replace Stims etc, it's just not *fun* anymore. 
---
I had a Grognak Ax I could decimate most everything with in 2 shots. Now I swing endlessly, plinking away at their health like I'm not even using a weapon.
---
Or sure, I could pull out the explosive handmade and empty a clip to take them out but eh... it's just not fun anymore. 
---
Ran a few OP's missions and the chaos is fun but ultimately unrewarding. 
---
I've earned all Tadpole and Possum badges, completed the story missions and have zero desire to grind for gear that could be rendered worthless with the next patch. 
---
Armor Ace has zero that I feel I 'must' have so... I'm on extended break for now.
---
Still feels like I'm not getting all the bodies tgat my teammates killed. Went back to the second uplink after we defeated the boss cause I remembered us killing a lot of bots there, but I didn't see nearly as many junk piles as a remembered seeing bots.
---
This üëÜüèª
---
Wouldn't mind if they adjusted weapon durability though.  Not a huge deal if you are rolling in improved repair kits, but still annoying having to repair my gun twice a day or more now after the patch.
---
Yeah, it's a bit like  a giant robotic mothman is emerging from my floor....
---
this better not be bethesda fucking up the lore again for fuck sake, it's common knowledge that bos doesn't have vertibirds yet. swear it's like they just don't give a shit. hope I'm wrong man
---
On same character?
---
Nice breakdown. Not OP, but I've been wanting to try this build too. Thanks!
---
This is definately the hardest one but I managed it solo with a bunch of stimpaks and a vampires Gatling. I just ran as best I could between the bits you have to do and ran round in circles to dodge the attacks from robots
---
opening the scoreboard when you first open the game prevents this happening for me
---
And what's up with fuzzy brenda.i go there blow up all the cars and she was still sleeping in the bus.i mean i know she drinks a bit but she is supposed to be a mascot.im boycotting mr.fuzzy's amusement park until she gets her act together.
---
Yep, you can get up to 3 rare rewards a day, every rank you unlock you roll for a reward, however the first two ranks are VERY low chance to drop a rare reward
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give that a try
---
The only missable item I know of with the raiders is a plasma gun during the final mission, so you would need to side with them to get it.  Either way do each factions missions to the point of "side with x" just to see all the quests.  As someone else said definitely do the settlers up to that point because the one item is either free, or 5,000 bullion if you miss out on it.
---
no, no and no
---
every game changes not just "live games"
---
Recommend doing both sides up to the point of no return, as there‚Äôs a lot of xp, caps, etc. that you‚Äôd be missing out on if you just rushed to the heist. Additionally, there‚Äôs a really nice set of gear (not gonna spoil it) that you learn how to make through one of the Settlers quests, so make sure to go all the way through as it‚Äôll save you almost 6,000 gold in the future
---
Tell that to oblivion
---
Thats a good question
---
Yep, it's the worst. It literally hijacks your control of the game. Just share buffs people not things that alter others play style.
---
God the boss is tough on the robot type. Assaultron are already a fight to the death now they just beefed one up
---
I think its a great idea, but im not sure it could be done without some sort of screw up on their part.  Plus they would have to auto lvl someone's shit hot guns and armour upto max lvl,  because nobody is ever going to go through all the trading and in game cap/flux/ammo cost to get said shit hot stuff all over again, because the max lvl has gone up.
---
Tempted to buy the plan just to avoid this and NEVER EVER craft a single one of these bastard things
---
Do all the missions in main until you get two missions that start ‚Äòsiding with‚Äô and then you‚Äôll have done those two story lines
---
It's because the gutsies with "assault rifle" hands (sound like - not look like) are completely imbalanced and appear to more or less entirely ignore all armor.
---
So it doesn't matter how tanky you are, as soon as a few of those spawn and you can't take them out quick you're dead.
---
Are Teslas no longer braking the game? I noticed a couple at events and my game didn‚Äôt look like Minecraft
---
Plans you get from Workshops are basically trash. Everyone (part from new players) will have them, I have a load up for sale, and I tend to throw them at new players if I see a low level around.
---
Junk is everywhere, loot everything! Also you can "tag for search" various different junks, so in world you'll see a magnifying glass next to the item name, letting you know this contains the resource you want after scrapping. Good way to learn what to collect and what to ignore.
---
I want to use one so badly that I am making a meele character
---
No kidding. I hunt the things down and have a collection that's nearly complete, only missing 3 at the moment with stacks of most issues.  Definitely have multiples of every bobblehead as well.
---
Despite my collection I have only ever used 2 magazines and 1 bobble in 320 something levels.
---
Gamer couples are a protected species! And any help or tips I can give to make your game easier I'll happily give :) knowledge shared is knowledge used etc.
---
My minigun does that, my go is just fine.
---
Could it be because the minigun was magic?
---
Technically optimized is fine, since it does help people using actually weapons, but the rest? Agreed.
---
Thanks for the useful information, I do have adrenaline 5 and demolition expert 3 at the moment so glad others use them as well, I had to put dense on the SS torso now I don't kill myself.
---
I'd not thought about scope, not bought the plan yet so I'll go get that and try it out, I was following Angry Turtles review of the gauss shotty so why I'm using a reflex.
---
With the raiders you might, if you are a collector, want to get the grafton steel PA helmet. And with the settlers you want to make sure you get the stealth suit. Personally I would do both factions up to the point of no return - at least the first time. I skipped the last raider quest (Johnny) on my later playthroughs unless I was siding with Meg.
---
Raiders have a unique plasma rifle during the vault helst (slug buster), and a raider outfit. Settlers got just an outfit during the vault helst.
---
Some for rifles would also be nice, such as a reduction in spread gaining from firing. It would make sense, as PA could definitely handle recoil better than normal armor.
---
Ahh yes the ancients used this flamingo unit system.
---
Quite accurate.
---
aye. love that perk but i wouldn't share it because it can be jarring
---
That might be the mod on your gatling.
---
I do have a quad roll so that my work nicely with what you say, AP is an issue, trying hard to increase this, but it runs out fast though.
---
If I can get some armor with that AP effect that should help but getting it is such a lottery.
---
Yeah thats a workaround for it. Still, loosing even 1sec when enemys run towards you can be important in certain locations.
---
Bloodied, fast reload with a higher chance for vats hit. It is the only ranged weapon I need. And now with the new missions, I never have to worry about craving ammo again. I went in with 100 ammo and I now have over 3000 after running the daily op a few times.
---
I'd love some cool skins for it.
---
This is bang on. People who expect to be proficient with weapons when their character has spent their entire life learning how to craft and build are a bit deluded. Like you said, if you build a glorified pack brahmin, you'll be as dangerous as one
---
It procs but keep in mind that it might sometimes not work (wikipage states that).
---
It would be an interesting addition to the game. However, I think the implications it could have on PVP wouldn't be very balanced. Bringing a Deathclaw Matriarch to a fight wouldn't be awfully fair to the opposing side. Regardless, though, it's an interesting idea.
---
There are so many ways to die at the hands of a robot, and they‚Äôre clever, relentless and remorseless.
---
A full set of Troubleshooters armour is the only thing to wear on a day out in the wasteland.
---
If you find one with bashing damage it's magic and does way increased damage in vats
---
There‚Äôs a couple of parameters to make a gun magic but I‚Äôm not sure what they are for big guns, I think it needs to a certain prefix and have a fire rate close to 200.
---
I‚Äôve seen people saying that the health rubber banding is caused by server lag but fuck knows haha
---
I'm just afraid I'll have to delete 80% of my camp just to place it. 
---
Had to delete 3 things just to place the weight bench only to discover it's not working currently.
---
gather ‚Äòround her
---
This needs more up votes and it‚Äôs own post
---
I hate them I get them every time
---
?
---
Still got the spares and maybe play ps4? If yes to both ill buy em?
---
After 1.5 years of the announcement of legendary perks...they are very disappointing.
---
I think we are the dumbest ones because we cannot make more copies so both Davenport and chosen faction  can get photos.
---
i used to one shot everything when i stopped playing, now i'm lucky to kill it within 2 reloads, it's fucked, this is even crit headshots too.
---
That's a good way to keep broken armor on. But you lose the benefits of the Berserker weapon, which is why I prefer a hazmat suit over a PA.
---
As if we'd waste out gold on learning the plans which I'd imagine is the only way to stop that message.
---
mate I'm over level 100 and still haven't got the achievement for hitting level 10 I know the pain
---
Points?
---
The Reddit Gods smiled upon me it seemed, we all had our moments of glory and failure.
---
Just yeet grenades at an encounter
---
Yes, in my experience, the bug That causes no ranged weapon to work is only enabled by Tesla rifles
---
This bug brought to the game with patch 21, the no damage bug was fixed with patch 21.
---
they fixed the performancebug with patch 22 and it seems the no damage bug came back with patch 22
---
Don't carry so much junk....
---
Carry less crap, get a proper backpack and look at other weight reduction perks like thru-hiker in agility
---
I hear you. I paid 3000 caps for my first instigating lever. I still have it.
---
I have a couple extra, what platform?
---
use damage perks until you need to fast travel than switch to weight reduction perks.
---
or you could do what i do. dont carry around a million things. i have my melee weapon, 2 heavy weapons and 1 combat rifle. chems can be fixed by either the strength perk or the backpack mod.
---
 Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
---
Yeah, if you use the mod intRaw Reborn, you'll see camp budget consisting of 10,000 "points", where most items cost 20 points, but utility and other things cost 40+
---
There are occasions when I wish I would fall faster so I could be a bit more responsive but like 90% of the time I love it for the reasons other people already pointed out. 90% ain't bad.
---
A literal point of no return? Im At the stage where it says to talk to both factions, I was worried this was it.
---
Is there a list of these one time rewards cause I really feel like I've disposed of items I shouldn't have now that you mention it. I know I definitely sold that Sommerset Special for scrip or whatever it's name is.
---
I did wonder if it's possible for you to get plans as one time rewards and if the game would let you drop them or sell them without warning you how big of a mistake that'd be...
---
Thanks! I thought I was being dumb and didn‚Äôt noticed it was a points system lol
---
Every shot with less than a 10% hit chance is always a crit
---
Thanks. Google is very unclear on this.
---
Are you on PS4? Would happily buy one of them.
---
I think if you manage to find a deathclaw matriarch, pacify it, lead it all the way to another player and convince the same player to engange in pvp against you and a deathclaw, you deserve the advantage.
---
Acually thats the problem. I never carry junk..
---
Nice, if only the game look that good up close üòî
---
Standard Commando, and Demolitions Expert, for the explosive effect.
---
Yeah, I find it very hard to adjust to quickly if it's shared. It's one of those perks that you have to be experienced with using otherwise you're dead very quickly lol
---
I have done all of those and its still a big problem
---
Darn, Xbox üò©

Xbox üò©üò©

The thing about vending is that the basic shit for lower level 50+ peeps are things they can't afford, and those *with* money are so far along they don't need virtually anything other than the mats to feed hungry weapons.
---
Rare seasonal stuff seems to make some coin. Other than that for me it was ammo, nuke keys, bubblegum (SCORE challenge), Nuka Cola, maybe select bloodied and unyielding pieces. I ran one machine which was always empty. 
---
I don't sell anymore as I just move shit on Discord and hide my base off the map as I don't want my shit broken or people standing on my roof!
---
Is there a utility protectron fixing up things? I‚Äôm wondering if someone is moving there or what...
---
Aa far as I know , there isn't a vats critical cap. I've got a Gauss rifle with 50 vats , better criticals and eagle eyes (50 + 40 + 25 = 115) , I've tested it without one of each and I notice less damage . If you have 33 luck and critical savvy , you can fill the crit bar by one shot only, or alternatively,  you can have vats fill as third Legendary effect on your weapon instead of 33 luck to get the refill in one shot.
---
Vats critical = PaperDamage + weaponBaseDamge (vats critical multiplier)
---
Mods that increase weapon base damage will increase Vats critical damage like Prime receiver and any damage increasing mod will yield difference in vats critical damage (although tenderizer doesn't show damage numbers)
---
Skeet shooter doesn't necessarily increase damage,  just reduced spread and increased accuracy.  Increased  accuracy increase vats hit chance so yeah that helps. And yes magic does apply to vats
---
Extra chems. What ever don't carry so much
---
So I only carry around 2 wapons and granades and I have all the possible perks to help with weigth and a 90% reduse on chems on my backpack but nothing seems to help.
---
Do all the quests for each group until you have a quest called "Side with Foundation" for settlers and "Side with Crater" for raiders. Whichever of the above quests you choose will align you with that faction for the end quest. Hope this helps
---
I hear ya brother, no good to a stealth commando
---
Davenport has had a sheltered life, doesn't understand how untrustworthy humans can actually be.
---
Damage is somehow coming out lower for me when I use all 3 perks for concentrated fire, it‚Äôs been looking really weird lately
---
thy could add an option to maybe block certain shared perks.
---
Shotgun build is the way to go still look for an aa explosive vatscost pump but if price is an issue look for sombody selling a fancy pump they are gold i still 1 shot everything but boss enemies i advise makshift bloodys switch to vangaurd and focus damage resist
---
How do you get this reactor ?
---
I think most of my inventory space goes to Aid stuff in general that I dont even use. Mabye thats the problem
---
Not possibly, no reason to wait for the bond to begin the op since the bond only takes 5 minutes and you only get the double xp for completing the op, which you probably arent doing in under 5 minutes. So starting a team and waiting around for the bond is just pointless
---
I need maybe 3 shots to kill him thx to a BE Laser Rifle...
---
Daily Ops reward, or trade for it with another player.
---
Sell it to a vendor bot. I carry 5 stim packs on me. And nothing else. I am carrying over 20 heavy weapons currently, half of the scrip. A ton on ammo and fusion cores. And have about 80 spare pounds of weight.
---
Have you considered Fireproof (END) another essential perk when using explosive weapons, or asbestos lining? I like to scavenge so all my armour is deep pocketed but I am considering going down that route to free up those endurance points.
---
LoneWanderer provides some good tutorials in addition to Angry Turtle, check out his channel on YouTube.
---
thx
---
For you. I like to make sure I get as much experience out if it as I can.
---
What in the hell is that?
---
It doesn't stack like that. You have an aa weapon, it ignores 50%. Put in tank killer, it than ingnors 50% (or what ever it is) of the remaining 50%. And so on
---
Look in misc for ore and gun powder, look at the ammo as well.
---
Is it just decoration or a generator? And if so, how much power does it give?
---
What about like food and water? Are thay useless?
---
uhhhh..... i guess check what else your carrying around. sort your misc tab by weight. sort ammo tab by weight and toss out mininukes and missiles. also check aid tab and look for spoiled food.
---
I carry plenty of food and water. But that's threw hiker in agility. It's not in str
---
Ive looked at my ammo but misc.. Jesus I compleatly forgot
---
I don't think it happens because you swap characters. I only have main and this stupid bug happens only when I am doing OPS. Had it twice yesterday.
---
support
---
I'm currently re-specing my rifleman into a heavy gunner, so somewhat in the same boat. 
---
Use excavator armor with calibrated shocks for the +200 carry weight. Don't bother with QOL perks like strong back and pack rat,  but invest into Bandolier and Batteries Included. 
---
Max out on the damage perks then switch out to the QOL perks after the fighting to travel back to camp.
---
What do you carry? In strength, I have all 3 heavy gunner perks (3*), blocker perk (3*) &amp; bear arms (3*). Due to my Chems, I have the Chem‚Äôs backpack on.
---
I have done all of those but tge misc.. Gotta do that
---
Another interesting tidbit.. if you mod them to ghillie you can then mod them back to either urban or forest since theres two mod slots (though it doesnt say or show which one is which, forest camo is on top). This only changes the appearance though, urban will still be urban but at least you can make your aesthetic appearance match the rest of your forest set. This also works for the scout mask.
---
Yes you have a point
---
Join a new server and be the creator of the team instead of joining existing ones (you could hop in to see if they're in an active Op, but leave it if they're not)
---
Excavator Power Armor, Unyielding armor/low health, deep pockets...
---
I seen the other posts saying you're carrying a lot of chems/aid. Are you a junkie build? If you're running junkie, try to stay away from addictions that affect strength, like buffout. If you're low health, cut out the radaway. Carry at most, 50 stimpaks, preferably closer to 25.
---
This helps a lot, I was at the point of being afraid to travel to either place and have the mission side with them.
---
Exploding Tesla shotgun - wipes smiles off a lot of faces üôÇ
---
Also, pumpkin racks like those outside the Pumpkin House. Not sure where they are from but I can build 3 or 4 styles if you're interested. Joe Camus 2 is the XBox ID.
---
100 power, but it's silent so no annoying fusion gen noise.
---
what are your str perks? 3 times heavy gunner makes 9 so there is room for bandolier 2 and bear arm 3. if you use lock and load 3 consider changing it to 1 bc faster reload is useless when you cant move.  
---
(never played a heavy gunner but looking through the perks, those perks seemed the most essential to me)
---
"WHAUGHT?!"
---
We lost a teammate in nuclear winter bc I ran to revive them first and my teammates all swarmed and it kept restarting the revive. So frustrating. Some things are a one person job!
---
So not really worth getting it for power. Thanks though
---
I carry pretty much all aid I can find, same with misc, I carry only 2 wapons at a time, never any junk and pretty much all ammo exept missiles and mini nukes and I carry 2 Fusion cores,no plasma, and armor that I only use.
---
I dont really use a spesific legendary effect on a spesific gun. I carry Weapons that I can do lots of damage/Got lots of ammo
---
So, it's 40% of the 50%? But, "armor" and "damage resistance" are the same in this case, correct?
---
its mostly about getting used to it. i used it quite a while, then changed my build and kicked it. now its back bc i see it as QOL :)
---
It‚Äôs unbelievable that these kind of major problems still exist in a game this big. I love fallout. I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE 76. And I loved Bethesda. But this is simply just too shitty.... but it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve logged in, maybe the overall experience is better now? There‚Äôs just too many other, better made, games I want to play now.....
---
Yep, we have all been there XD.
---
Bro just ignore them and launch the nuke what are they gonna do about it
---
There is a rad scorpion cave!?!?
---
It sucks that you don't like them. I have the sneak damage one, the ammo crafting one, infiltrator (a joy), plus leggy STR and LUCK. I'm loving them.
---
Maybe in time you'll like them?
---
Probably rush in there with their 20 keycards and kill me for the launch
---
Feel bad for lower levels that don't have kits/a bunch of screws yet.  Could get pretty frustrating trying to keep on top of maintaining a piece of gear you like that can't be easily replaced.
---
Try taking aid that you regularly use and ammo for you primary and secondary guns only.
---
Dont bring along Daddy-O if you only use psycho and stims, dont carry. 308 if you only use 50cal. 
---
You can hoard ammo, but its just taking up space if you're not pumping it back into mobs.
---
work on your build. i got mediocre gear, a 2* b33 handmade and a lvl 100 scorched takes like 2-3 hits.  
---
tenderizer, tank killer, adrenaline, taking one for the team are a great help. even got rid of bloody mess now and it still works fine.
---
Nooooooooooooooo!
---
Pretty sure they will have to do everything that you did even if just use their key card to launch because they will put the keycard in then put the code in you have more than enough time to be sitting there spamming the interact button to get the launch before they do and they cant kill you unless you attack them
---
Dont let crazy people or crazy talk under the skin in any circumstance.
---
Carry Ammo you use, Heavy weapons and only Aid you use, such as stims, psycho etc
---
Just don‚Äôt shoot back???
---
*Ammo if
---
I don‚Äôt know if you need a ‚Äúbuild‚Äù per se. You just need to be thoughtful about perks aligning to weapons you use.
---
No problem at all! Glad this post is still helping folks out :)
---
Happened to me today. That‚Äôs when I knew it was time to drop a nuke on the team leaders camp.
---
That's a good point. I never thought about it like modding (which is insanely popular with all Beth games). That changes my perspective a bit.
---
Nuke their camps instead.
---
Takes 2 or 3 swings for Wendigo, otherwise OK.
---
If only they wouldnt leave before that happened
---
I had a similar problem with normal mode, solved by reinstalling the game
---
Also a good point. It's impossible not to get downvoted. This post has been downvoted a lot and I just asked a question lol
---
It‚Äôs a double edged sword. I‚Äôve been booted 3 times because of the PL disconnecting. 
---
But, on the flip side, I‚Äôve booted atleast 10 leechers that stand around and do nothing the entire op.
---
Specifically enjoy waiting until the boss spawns(this seems to be their cue to come running and actually fight) and then give them das boot.
---
Really wish we could vote to boot leechers from ACP instances as well. 15-20 times now, my group has been split because of a leecher that stands at the top of the mine the entire event.
---
No! And dont try to tell me what to do!!
---
Just nuke their base, then they will leave the server, problem solved.
---
Fair point, nukacrypt also helps
---
Yeah that's what I do when someone tries to steal my launch I just steal their keycard
---
Do you have a grocers or chemist backpack? Either mods will decrease weight for food and water or chems by 90%
---
Haha nice
---
[this might help finding the junk you need :)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
I mean... why would you wanna nuke elsewhere...
---
Drop a nuke on their camps.
---
Flora, enemies, see what it's like to have those places nuked etc
---
I hear this so much and now I may do that
---
In all seriousness, you are doing all the work so you get to decide where the nuke goes. I appreciate people nuking for fauna so I can go and collect shit I need.
---
The way I understand it, the resistance values for players and creatures is a number, say 750. You could call that armor. That value translates to a damage reduction %, like 68%.
---
Yes, this gun is the only missable thing. Providing you do all the quests for both factions until you get the side with quest you wont miss anything else.
---
After the raid, you can still do the daily quests for both factions to get rep up and reach Ally status with both.
---
Also do you know any good spots for those?
---
If they ain't dropping nukes where they want them, they ain't got a say in where you put it.
---
He‚Äôs saying we need to be allowed to plant them...
---
Agreed.
---
Place it on a power conduit
---
But it doesn't go fucking nuts....
---
Apparently you haven't.
---
Brilliant reply thanks very much üëçüëç
---
Thank you very helpful
---
Just launch it where you want.
---
If people complain they should have launched it themselves
---
Is this why I haven‚Äôt been able to use it? Ah ok thought my character was bugged or something.
---
So since patch 22 I‚Äôve now deleted my entire shop and now my weights bench due to exploits/bugs. 
---
Hope it gets sorted soon.
---
Great , really useful thanks
---
White springs is by the far the most popular as there is a good mix of ghouls and fauna.
---
It doesn't bother me as much when I'm out in the world i think because most of the time I'm in sneak, giving me those few extra seconds to pull out of vats if I want to but in Daily Ops, oh boy, I just can't respond fast enough to keep myself alive lol
---
Exactly, me being in the level 50s just pisses me off when I hear people tell me to nuke monogah or fissure prime, it's my nuke and if I did that I wouldnt even be able to interact with the events because I'd die instantly pretty much
---
Did you ask them to share something else? I always ask my daily ops teams what they want since we are all fighting together, might as well work together.
---
Well joke's on him, im into that kinda shit!
---
No the absolute worst is randomly every 3-4 ops mid load bar I randomly exit my PA and get stuck outside of it. Without being bumped or anything. 
---
The PA then spawns at 45 degrees to the ground and I can‚Äôt get back in. 
---
Very annoying bug!!!
---
Exactly, it makes me sad no one nukes there much anymore but hey it's their nuke
---
&gt; \-Can someone please explain how the public teams work and what kind of playing should go in each category? 
---
As its stated, it gives you a buff depending on the number of players in that team and the type of team you are on. For XP get into a Casual team as it gives intelligence.
---
&gt; \-WHY DOES NO ONE SELL JUNK? 
---
Its a waste of space for most people, stash space is precious.
---
&gt; \-WHY DONT PEOPLE BUY MY THINGS? Are my prices too high? I put things at a range of 1-25 caps and the 25 cappers are like plans. 
---
the plans you are selling are probably the once that drop in every event, people already got all of them. If you sell bullets, never go above 1 cap, never sell unwanted ammo.   
---
Dont bother selling low level legendarys for more than the scrip value (100 per star to a maximum of 300 per star)  
---
Dont sell non legendary weapons and armor, dont sell common outfits.
---
&gt; \-how exactly do daily op link ups work? 
---
Walk up to them, hold the button that shows up, wait around until the bar is full, dont get murdered. Also, always go for the objective marker, ignore the enemys on your way as much as you can.
---
&gt; \-I just don‚Äôt understand so much in this game and when playing with other players I don‚Äôt know, everything moves so fast. 
---
You will get used to it, everyone had a hard time in the beginning.  
---
If you have a Specific question to ask that google has no answer for, this is the right subreddit to ask it in.
---
&gt; \-are there any good spots to get things like gears, screws, steel, etc? 
---

Mine was magic.
---
Instigating 25 25 and over 200 fire rate, used to melt Earl in seconds, now causes dmg lags
---
DR is the same as armor.
---
 Penetrating mag+ AA would ingore 70% of enemy armor.
---
AA + tank killer ignores 68%.
---
AA + tank killer + penetrating mag ignores 80.8% armor
---
AA + tank killer + stinging mag ignores 74.4% armor.
---
Yeh I figured because i havent done it before im not sure whether i just go to the site and do it or in game in the  menu
---
Okay great but this is clearly not enough. How much STR? Mutations? Buffs to Melee and/or STR? Or even better, comparision to Bloodied Sledgehammer?
---
ProTip
---
Don‚Äôt concentrate on killing them. 
---
Just activate the beacons 
---
Every time you kill one another spawns in, killing them is useful for health regen (vampires/absorption) or XP only. 
---
Also, vampires is pretty much a requirement for daily ops 
---
Finally with vampires hit points seem to reverse the freezing effect I‚Äôve found
---
Where did you get the legendary from?  
---
I got the plan on day one but had no luck so far.
---
Yeah this fucks me off with PA to. PA has to be a full set INcluding the head. So much for using my x-01 head with headlamp mods on my T-65. Even out of PA I've never had a full matching set of anything.
---
Good pic, my dude. I love the photo mode in this game.
---
I found wendigos are kind enough to spare players life. Just avoid the falling debris. I always share that perk during ACP.
---
I'm using a Life Saving armour piece and it revived me several times during Operations. Of course the HP it restores isn't very high and you risk getting killed again right afterwards unless you immediately heal or flee.
---
I wouldn't use Mysterious Savior, but Life Saving is a good and useful effect in my opinion.
---
I use the med box outside of Vault 76, kill the 3 liberators and enter the van, behind the drivers seat. Used this method on xbox to transfer items to my mule two days ago. Im pretty sure it has something to do with the capacity limit of what you place the items in.
---
I think the point of the instanced camp is that it doesn‚Äôt need to necessarily impact the server as much. 
---
It is possible to have this as a client side offline area with the player character being (reserved) on the server side so that upon exit you rejoin the same server. 
---
Although I would imagine it remains in the server but doesn‚Äôt load in for players not actually in the instanced cell.
---
You're right, there are definately people that would benefit from the implementation of text chat.
---
* The public teams provide bonuses to xp and will help you level quicker. Most people join a public team, and play solo for the most part. They will occasionally run into one another at an event. Each type of team has a bonus, you can pick the team according to the bonus you'd like. Since the update, I've either joined or created a casual team because there is a x4 xp bonus when players become bonded. x4 xp on all kills, not just events, or daily ops. 
---
* Junk takes up a ton of inventory space, and doesn't sell well. Its easier to sell junk to an npc vendor when in need of caps.
---
* Scrapping weapons is the best way to gain materials. Equip a scrapper perk, and pick up as much as you can carry.
---
* Youtube is a great resource for farming locations, screws drop pretty random but can be gotten from scrapping guns I believe.
---
* I think most people will shop hop looking for something they need, try to stock a few things from each category. I didn't see much vendor sales until I passed level 50, most lower level players are limited to what level weapons drop for them, as well as what they can use.
---
pretty sure this is more likely going to be more useful for our instanced vaults coming this winter. the way that it should snap with a vault building set.
---
I uninstalled my game the other night. Vats got worse, and they nerfed game damage by changing the algorithm without buffing the weapons to compensate so the entire game is just using up all your meds/supplies/ammo until you min/max a build and just run daily ops for ammo.
---
If you get scrapper in a card pack, otherwise I wouldn't waste a perk on it unless I had them to spare. There are too many unscrapped weapons people just leave on mobs, imo. Just scrap more stuff and you don't really need the perk.
---
That's all well and good, but where on earth do you get one of these from
---
Yeah I love how switching damage models literally did nothing since you still have exactly the same problems you used to, now they are just exacerbated because you need more than one shot for most enemies so that's fan-fucking-tasting!
---
With a build

I have the same thing with a dB 3 star shotgun damn thing 2-3 shots. Only thing I can tell that helps it is 33% hit chance in vats, every other shotgun just sucks.
---
I got 2 rare rewards in one op once. Still missing the lights, outfit and hat, solar and nuclear generator (don't really need those), liquid courage and some other stuff. I got all the stuff i wanted on the first days
---
Just remove enemy level from being displayed. I think your too fixated on a number that no longer matters.  Maybe just move to a mechanic that displays overall challenge type next to it or remove it all together.
---
I generally carry an entire team to sub 8 minutes when it‚Äôs possible but with yesterday‚Äôs freezing enemies it was annoying. 
---
It seems a lot of people don‚Äôt pay attention to the screen with regards to the 1x/2x/3x/4x boost, worse still they don‚Äôt fight the boss at the end and run around killing randoms or looting. 
---
When a good team joins though it is spot on. 
---
Sub 6 minutes is pretty easy with others if not better.
---
For starters I'm not buying everything the media says about them. As a starting point people keep acting like teachers over there get paid more than any other teacher in the world. That's a lie, they get paid $40-50k just like in any other first world country.
---
And to think that Finnish students do better than American ones because of financial reasons is also a lie. Here's a myth debunked on a site that did a study on Finland's education system:
---
11) Finnish children do better in school than American students simply because the poverty rate is so much lower.
---
Fiction. The poverty rate in Finland is certainly lower, but what makes the difference in education is equity combined with quality. Instead of highlighting individual performance and competition of students in Finland the focus is on schools‚Äô ability to provide equally good education for different learners. Basic education is completely free including instruction, school materials, school meals, health care, dental care, special needs education and remedial teaching. One Finnish specialty is the free hot lunch served to everyone every day. Hungry students cannot learn well.

---
While there's more to talk about in terms of Finland I haven't studied it extensively to make a good conclusion on their case. However I haven't seen a a single case that triumphs over a student taking his or her education into their own hands through simply picking up books and studying from them. That method isn't only free, but more effective.
---
This, usually if I join a team and start it after a minute or so they all pile in.
---
Heres a copy and paste of an older comment of mine kind of explaining it:
---
Pretty much take the remaining armor % of each peice being applied and multiply them together and that gives you the remaining armor. Sub tract that from 100 and tbat gives you your armor pen value.
---
For example: tank killer 36%, anti armor 50% , and peircing mag 20%  would look like
---
*.64 x .5 x .8 = .256 or 25.6% armor remaing. So it ignores 74.4% armor.*
---
Incisor + Anti armor would be :
---
*.25 √ó .5 = .125 or 12.5% armor remaining aka, 87.5% armor ignored.*
---
% damage reduction gear like sentinels, lone wanderer, slayer armor, dodgy all work the same way.  Another example using 5 sentinel peices. Each peice reduced damage 15% so there would be 85% damage remaining each peice. 
---
*.85 x. 85 x. 85 x. 85 x .85 = .4437 ( % damage remaining)*
---
So you get  55.63% damage reduction from 5 sentinels peices.
---
really hope the bos waste this guy, such a sap
---
What are wearing in a nuke zone that you are using that gauntlet?
---
Best spot for violet is around hemlock holes maintenance yard. 
---
Not necessarily for the flora itself but for the waves of enemies that you can create by starting the workshop defend event while nuked. Great for hardened mass, glowing mass and HR fluids
---
It got nerfed. Imagine Ammo factory going from 50/75/100/150 to 25/50/75/100.

---
I think the SPECIAL cards &amp; infiltrator are safe from the nerf-o-tron, but anything with a percentage attached to it is suspect. I wouldn't put more than just the base card in for anything with a percentage. Especially if they can somehow monetize what it does. Just saying the timing of the White Knight nerf and repair kit's announcement was enough to raise eyebrows.
---
Oh no is there another new currency?
---
Personally, I think workshops are a bad idea for new players to get involved with. It opens them up to getting ganked by griefers, and losing more junk than they started with. Not to mention the junk extractors are super slow, so you have to hold the workshops for long periods of time and I just feel like that time could better spent going out and collecting it.
---
Yes that sounds like the way to go when in ops team. We were just a casual team though so not ops team specifically but one of us kept going into daily ops by himself so I thought, yeah why not, I'll join him. I got there and so did the other two, one of which was sharing the perk. I really wanted to play ops after that so that's why I left unfortunately.
---
Who said they will fix ?
---
I'm normally a heavy gunner build, but in a nuke zone i wear the Chinese stealth suit as it gives more rad resistance. I swap some cards and become a melee build, with that Chinese suit i dealt more damage than a full unyielding set today.
---
Ah yeah, prolly best to find a dedicated Ops team and just grind that, then switch out if doing adventure mode.
---
Bethesda doesn't understand the concept of play testing.
---
Remember B.E.T.A?
---
noice
---
My computer monitor doesnt even do 4k still looks better than the actual game
---
Rose for thinking I have the attention span of a fly and that I need to be reminded everytime I log on to do her quest
---
okay now on an unrelated note how do I get plans for blood packs
---
man often times people post their ingame shots they are cool but nothing out of the ordinary,
---
this however...
---
this looks like advertising material or something straight out of a horror movie
---
great job!
---
if you die 3 times on one enemy it's not the game. It's you.
---
It's so stupid, how can they expect people to play properly anymore. My gatling gun did 477 damage now 344. Not to mention that it's a tse, i use adrenal reaction to have the bloodied effect. With full health i don't even get near 300
---
The only missable item anyways.  As far as missing out on in game experiences, the raiders quest line was more fleshed out and interesting than the settlers stuff for me.  Some entertaining stuff in there.... if the quests don't bug out and piss you off at least.
---
I have had them still work since 22, and I‚Äôve definitely tested them out far more often since 22, but I also think that some enemies are doing a lot more damage to the point where you don‚Äôt get downed first.
---
Yeah sure, if i was lvl 10 then that would be the case, i'm lvl300ish. I know how to play
---
That‚Äôs correct, you buy the plans for both: the Secret Service chest piece, and the jet pack for it. Craft the Chest piece, using a Legendary Module from the purveyor, over and over until you get a legendary effect you are happy with. Then if you have the jet pack plan, you can modify the chest piece to add the jet pack.
---
I have had mine for a couple of weeks - it‚Äôs pretty fun! There may be more practical alternatives, but there are things in life that are more important than not getting killed a lot. Um, right?
---
I know it doesn't really matter, but the gold cards should be worth 5 instead of 2.
---
So far I've gotten BOS Spec Ops suit and mask, burrows signs, and vault 94 stash. Really want sympt-o-matic.
---
Some people said before that this is now a new calculation with buffs and that later on it would become better
---
you got the fact that the whole damage calculation was changed? those old number mean nothing anymore. my bloody handmade does 170 damage now and im completly fine with a lvl 100 scorched taking 3 hits.
---
33% vats hit chance triggers magic damage on weapons that generate spread like shotguns, laser rifles with splitters, Ect. It's a bug that causes the weapon to deal way more damage than it should
---
I know these are coming from Daly ops, but are the plans saleable? Or is it like bullion shit?
---
Ikr i have a ultracite set that i use t60 cuz calibrated shocks on
---
No, they can be traded, only War Glaive can't.
---
If you need some damage perks as a "basic build requirement", isnt the game balanced in a wrong way?
---
My reasoning is that If you are required to have 30% damage boost perk to any weapon to be decent, the devs are limiting the build space artificially, when its not needed.
---
Why not drop the basic perk cards, buff all weapons by 30%, and give players the ability to spec as they want without mandatory perks? That would improve the RPG elements by making more varied builds better, without damaging the combat builds at all.
---
Its ridiculous that in a game you have mandatory non-passive perks. If its mandatory, make it passive, or in this case, just buff damage OR reduce health pools.
---
For example, armor penetration perk cards. They improve damage, irs a useful perk for dealing damage, but is not a direct +X damage. Is not a simple "gatekeeping" perk, althou enemies do have a ton of armor now.
---
 But ina bad balanced game, imagine all enemies had 7000 armour, and weapons only dealt 10% damage at that point for armor calculations. And then there is armor penetration. You ignore half the armor, so it has 3500 armor, and weapons deal 40% the damage they are supposed to. Is this game well balanced? No, because if you dont have that armor penetration perk, you have are doing 25% of the damage people with the perk does. That makes that perk mandatory.
---
And thats whats happening with fo76. We are not there yet, but with each step that changes damage mechanics in the game, you are more forced to use B2525, Uny, combat-focused heavy/melee/fixer build.
---
In other fallouts, you could sneak around to complete objectives, snipe from afar, farm better equipment and resources, and enjoy the game without having to run dry of supplies with each engagement you had, even if you didnt invest A SINGLE POINT in combat perks/abilities. Sure, if you were in the wrong place, like somewhere where you shouldnt be because of levem or dealing with final bosses/high risk zones, you needed a more combat focused builds, but in FO76, as now, if you want to do something, whatever it is, you need a combat focused build or you have a high risk of eunning out of weapons, armor, ammo, and resources in general. Before, you could run out of everything, go back to the forest, and ressuply. Now, once you are out of resources, you have to unistall the game, or beg and prat that anyone gives you supplies.
---
Yeah i got that fact, it's bs. No one asked for it, all they had to do was nerf legacies not the whole game. Besides i put this gun in, i'm fine with that gun. What bothers me is that my gauntlet does zero to no damage.
---
Yeah i was hoping that changing that would make it differrnt too :/ i guess they are jus coded as different armours in d game.... but that do use the same mods
---
I never understand these types of gameplay mechanics anyway. In a game about customization, it limits customization. Through customization. I mean what?
---
Adrenal reaction isn‚Äôt intended to work at full health
---
Once you learn the plan it will drop like the fixer. So the purveyor and some events, and daily ops have a chance to drop one
---
Daily ops reward. Comes as a plan.
---
I didn't notice. I joined a team where a player was carrying everyone using a hacked weapon (it 1-shotted everything, so I was literally stood there with nothing to shoot at).
---
Huge kudos to that player. I still got 'none' as my reward though, LUL.
---
I know that, it turns the weapon at base damage until you lose health. Which marks my point of not reaching 300
---
Big ouch, so I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll eventually fix it?
---
Definitely has an horrific look.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ why can some people just not accept when they've fucked up. Hotfixes are whatever their fuck they need to be to fix what needs to be fixed. Some are server sides but just as many may require updates to client side files.
---
You don't even fucking understand what you're talking about on a fundamental level.
---
I didn‚Äôt realise you needed a plan? Must have picked it up without knowing. 
---
EDIT: Just looked it‚Äôs not in my list of plans or recipes, try getting tick blood etc and see if you can make one
---
I didn't take it. With perk loadouts coming in december i'll just have to make an infiltrator one and boom i'm in
---
No firing delay, one of the reasons I wish it was just a little better in a couple of ways.
---
Excellent work, I might have to try this. Thanks
---
Each to their own but...
---
* You get more Specials!  Even if you don't like the specific perks.  You get extra specials
---
* QoL additions such as lvl one master infiltrator gets rid of 6 perk cards.  
---
They are a little tacked on and could be integrated a bit better in the UI.  The artwork also isn't very fallout.   But saying that, it allows for some interesting builds and also allows for tuning builds to your own playstyle
---
Ugh I started one then a bunch of level 20-30s joined, but I started the daily ops and waited for 10 minutes at the start and not one of them joined
---
i think they still work fine on tankier builds,
---
if you have a squishy build the damage from enemies is enough to instakill you most of the time
---
its a bit counterintuitive imo as youd think that an effect like this would be more usefull on a glasscanon that dies often
---
anyways if you dont have it yet id suggest you use nerdrage to reduce the impact of that last hit you take, maybe that helps
---
That imo is againts the basic principle of an rpg. Rpgs are there to give players choice, freedom, and liberty on how to play a game. If you make an rpg with a fixed build to "make the game fun", whats the point of having builds?
---
Me too. Some of my quests auto-completed, and I know I‚Äôve been in the greens nearby many times. Just never saw the tower before today. Legendary ghoul at the top, though, so that was good.
---
Git....       ....better.
---
Obviously not!
---
The event is still dropping rare items, got the flag plan the other day and it is the first thing i ever got from this event.
---
sounds like it
---
Obv
---
Of course
---
And here I thought it was my shitty internet!! Glad to know that‚Äôs not the problem!
---
You don't understand the concept of a server load test.
---
Yeah my magic shotgun was only taking small bites. So I switched to my Vampire Gatling Plasma and just sat there melting it.
---
I started putting together a troubleshooters SS set for events like awol armaments &amp; encryptid, came in real useful for today though i must say
---
I‚Äôm a heavy build and I‚Äôm not finding it a problem but it is hard for people with certain builds even high end players. One of my friends is in the 300s and they feel like giving up because it‚Äôs tough now I feel for people who are struggling
---
Didn‚Äôt it the first time today, just before you leave it‚Äôs on the right hand side.
---
Got a vault 99 suit today... But one vending machines had the ops suit for 2000 caps only...
---
Thing is u just put all ur perk points into QOL cards... for example you dont need woodchucker, green thumb and butchers bounty equiped all the time.
---
Instead depending on the weapons u use put them points into Commando/Rifleman or whatever. Defensive perks like fireprof or Life giver are also mandatory in combat these days...
---
Long story short: U have to swap perk cards denpending on what u re gonna do like farming, daily ops, silo run, SBQ, Earl...
---
I have chemist
---
Welp, you actually need a pretty high lvl to get some of the right legendary perks for bloodied maxed out but... my main actually seems to be more durable than my Junkies heavy gunner now, i shit you not. 
---
I admit, you really gotta know what to do with a bloodied build now. But my mains UNY SS set on 20% health beats my junkies heavy VAN SS set when it comes to durability just caused by the possibillities the extra perk points and other benefits from the new legendary perks gave us. Both sets are sentinel and it looks like im not taking dmg while standing still anymore.
---
I tested this with the two sentrys in front of Whitesprings. Did go there and let them have a go for a few minutes on both chars. Yes, minutes. But i have to say, the heavy gunner survived longer in the end and didn't die cause of born survivor. Still its impressive.
---
Edit: Just if you're wondering, lifegiver bug seems to work again. Makes it easier.
---
It‚Äôs something they had mentioned way back when Wild Appalachia was on the horizon, but nothing ever came of it. Hopefully they‚Äôll come back around and invest some more time into the cryptids cause the Sheepsquatch is by and far one of the most interesting enemies in the game, yet can only be found through a rather simple event
---
Yeah I run Nerd Rage and I‚Äôm a full health build, it makes little to no difference. Perhaps my health is too low but I do have reasonable endurance and I‚Äôm making a set of thorn armour so it‚Äôs not a weak set... I‚Äôll keep testing.
---
This was how they intended players to react imo instead we got whiny boomers complaining about their play being affected by others in an open world game.
---
Radscorpions....i hate radscorpions
---
Introducing Skyrim fallout 76 edition. 
---
16 times the arrows to the knee
---
There‚Äôs a few quests in the main section but if you work through them all, two should eventually lead to the ‚Äòsiding with‚Äô missions. Stop when you reach that point with one mission line and work on the others until you get another like that, and then pick who you wanna side with!
---
No. Everyone just approached Whitesprings the first time from over the mountains, and then every time after that they just fast travel.
---
It's in a part of the map there's pretty much no reason to ever go unless you're looking for that tower.
---
Yeah, VATS is even more broken than before. I also do more damage outside of VATS than with it even though my stealth commando is VATS specced. I'm considering switching out Concentrated Fire for the accuracy/reload speed perk and quit using VATS completely.
---
Arktos lap coat
---
IMO, I think a bloodied or high health PA build is the best for all around gameplay, and then maybe a bloodied stealth commando is best when it comes to SBQ and Earle.
---
Bloodied is still the best damage-wise, its just much more even now with others, so people don't feel quite as pressured into that build alone. Its still high risk, high reward, but the reward just isn't as good as it was.
---
Who are these people telling you what to do? If they‚Äôre politely giving you advice that‚Äôs fine but if they‚Äôre being wanks about it, block them and do what you want. It helps everyone to drop a nuke on a boss area but ultimately you put in the work you choose where to drop it
---
Is the slug buster any good? I‚Äôve had it just sat in my stash because I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs worth using or trading
---
My bad. 
---
Git less embarrassing.
---
allright i wish you good luck with finding a solution üëçüèº
---
Let us know how it works out for you if you do switch.
---
I hear you but still, if you only equip QoL perks how can you expect to deal decent damage? Every RPG has some specialization, be it tank, healer, dps or whatever. And all these builds and more are possible in fo76. I‚Äôve yet to see an RPG with a build or class that specialized in just hoarding stuff.
---
Now that's a wallpaper
---
Hmm mine is a Furious ff25 with 15 vats crit fill. Shredding everything (which is nice). Maybe it‚Äôs a bug idk.
---
It‚Äôs very cool, Bateman, but that‚Äôs nothing. Look at this. [eggshell with Romalian type](https://i.imgur.com/JVWek6T.jpg) What do you think?
---
Well, he still asks me to take photos and doesn't care if I straight up tell him, I sold them.
---
Also: Why can't I just take 2 or 3 photos and sell 2, give him one?
---
Mkay ty good sir
---
Also one handed melee 
---
It‚Äôs absolutely possible because...Skyrim
---
Delusional
---
Exactly, they act as if flora and fauna dont exist
---
Will do. Aiming manually works well most of the time, since the patch I use VATS mostly for small stuff which is difficult to target (molerats, insects, etc). I use less ammo that way than in bugged VATS.
---
I see, thank you
---
Then stimpack plan is expensive in whitesprings however check vendors around the whitespring area I‚Äôve found endgame players who want a cap sink buy the expensive plans and sell them cheap every now and again.
---
Ah, thank you for the input
---
No, I understand the concept of alpha and beta testing a game for bugs before releasing them though. So calling a server load test a beta test when your game is completely broken is a fallacy.
---
They should have called it P.O.C. 
---
Proof of Concept.
---
I got stimpack plans, I just need to efficiently get those blood packs
---
Which fallouts are you talking about? Some fallout games you can't even use weapons without investing into them
---
A shotgun with vamps triggers like 7 healing effects, 1 per pellet. If its explosive you double it
---
Your gauntlets only trigger 1 per hit
---
Youre beating the op in under 5 min?
---
I generally hit Wilson lumber, then the moonshiners shack, then dolly sods for tick blood with butchers bounty on, gets me a fair few. 
---
Either that or do daily ops, a large percentage of the enemies drop stimpacks as well as contextual ammo.
---
EDIT: Or a lot of players sell stims for 9c each which is the same they would get if they sold to a vendor (I have 127 for sale for example üòÖ)
---
Great, I've already been scrapping my weapons and armors for mods so thats good at least and it seems like I need more weight reduction perks
---
No but I still want my experience. All of it. I'll wait the 5 minutes.
---
I‚Äôm running a rx580, 2600, and 16gb of ram. On the lowest settings on 1440p I will get around 50fps, not extremely smooth but playable.
---
Yeah but even 1/7 before the nerf would be way more then 0hp.... Which is what it does now... I didn't test that well before and now it's literally 0hp on hit.
---
After the update I'm just not finding it fun anymore. Don't think I'll keep playing. This is from a level 60+
---
Work around like wearing broken armor? That‚Äôs a staple of being a bezerk character? Like unyeilding to a bloody...
---
I hate how Bethesda overprices everything
---
You do have the choice to make a non combat build, but that also means you are PLAYING as a non combat character. How is that not player choice?
---
If every character was equally good at combat then that would be less of an rpg in my opinion.
---
Hope it helps. üëç
---
thanks everyone this is really helpful!
---
They‚Äôre most annoying even in vats ha ha
---
Yeah never buy from an in game vendor, players always üòÖ
---
I buy all my fusion cores from players for this reason as I‚Äôm not paying 320c! Travelling vendor comes around with that price again she‚Äôs getting tossed on the punji boards.
---
Your keycard, your nuke. Launch where you want friend. They can launch it themselves if they wanna launch it in a certain place. People will bitch and moan about EVERYTHING lol
---
Except for lead, no one sells fkn lead
---
Just let a full set of utility armor break. Unyeild/lifesaving/Cham all still give the benefits broken
---
Same goes with fusion cores as rewards, I don't use PA and I'm getting quite a collection of cores from doing events along with the formentioned mini nukes.
---
I'm selling them but they aren't going down as quick as I receive them lol
---
No never
---
Radiation rumble event, hop on to the roof above the decon showers and kill all the ghouls. Make sure you are well rested, have food xp buffs, casual team, berry mentats, egg head mutation, herd mentality mutation, carnivore/herbivore mutation, strange in numbers, inspirational perk. And of course lunch boxes if you have them. Your xp will soar
---
It‚Äôs not so much the capacity but the fact it doesn‚Äôt snap to any building materials that annoys me.
---
All i hear is ‚Äútake the role out of a role playing game‚Äù 
---
Give me a break, its something every other rpg has, go play something else if a survival game has too much difficulty in surviving
---
take cover behind walls, and take them out as quickly as possible to avoid getting frozen.
---
The bloodied haters are just jealous we could get the good gear and they don‚Äôt see that the *real* problem is the magic weapon users. On PC it‚Äôs hacked and magic weapon users.
---
The fuck are you talking about? Clear whoosh? I just had my mind blown.  Is this some cultural thing I missed out on because im 32?
---
I play my own way and my character came out way tougher after the patch I don't get how people that were playing they're own qeay didn't end up better off too it was supposed to level the playing field for us
---
Apparently woosh means something other then what I thought.  /shrug
---
Gotta get a vampries weapon to keep on quick swap. Vampire explosive is vest since each hit counts as a heal.
---
Ahe came to my camp for the first time last week and was wrecking my turrets and fence. I got all excited I thought maybe this was a hidden part of the quest line and I thought how cool! So I pulls out the legacy and attempt to melt her and shortly realized it's just a bug and shes s vendor ):
---
It is awesome though that she shows up.
---
I could be wrong but do stimpacks negate the slowdown? I feel like whenever I heal I instantly go back to regular movement speed, as if I had been crippled
---
It may be a coincidence but certainly feels like it's the case
---
Well I'm 37 so maybe it's specific to 32 year olds who don't realize sarcasm is self-evident through text.
---
Rose has interface ports in all the right places! üòÑüëçüèº
---
Waht exactly is the problem ?
---
I don't think that operations are difficult in solo, I think everyone is just used to fallout being too easy
---
Sheepsquatch can be found in the wild without being in the event, I find them all over the place. There is even a couple of random encounters that spawn one in.( Look for a gutsy herding some Brahmin)
---
Funny how in fallout 4 the windmill gives like 3 power lol
---
The problem with FO76 is that combat is essential, and the main focus of the game. In the other games, non-combat builds make more sense than in FO76, because you could approach in different ways, or force the game through leveling and gear alone, in FO76, now everytjing is your level, and all non-meta equipment is far worst than the meta. Is a fundamental FO76 problem. Is too combat centered that non-combat builds are already penalized. Now, with the new changes, they are even more penalized
---
Edit: Just as a clarification, I do agree that combat builds should be better at combat, but non-combat builds should be more viable than they are right now
---
Bruh fuck anything with robots in them those shitlords are annoying
---
We could get on into the intricacies and nuance of the english language or... or.... You play on PC?
---
I‚Äôve had absolutely zero luck then as I‚Äôve never found em outside of the Free Range event. Good to know that they can be found outside of it, but still hoping BGS adds more cryptid material in the future
---
They were supposed to be on the top but this sh*tty bug ruined the game lol..i tried that but cant find anybody sticking out.
---
THIS ISN'T SPIDER-MAN! I SAID BRING ME PICTURES OF SPIDER-MAN OR YOU'RE FIRED PARKER!!!!!
---
PS4 baby! I'm a console pleb.
---
Thanks for clarification, she was pretty upset when she didn't get one, then got a laugh when she got two. This is good information to know.
---
The only thing a mini nuke is good for in this game is a butt plug.
---
I kill things in 3/4 shots using b commando, looks like its a build problem here
---
I'm right there with you, mate.
---
My friend is 1 out of 4 on getting elder plans.
---
I know the datamined numbers claim to be 5%, 10%, and 80%, but that elder % is hard to believe at this point.

Magic Q versions also don't suffer from the gauss shottys weak durability as much üëç
---
I have a Junkie,2 bloodied and 2 full health characters ..
---
I‚Äôve been playing with all of them and have focused on my bloody heavy gunner, but swapped it to full health.
---
I‚Äôm not convinced that the difference in damage with bloodied is worth the additional downsides. 
---
Running what rads, one for the team and electric absorbsion means I rarely have to worry about health and do good damage I also carry a vampires flamer or vampires plasma as my second weapon
---
Best places I've found for encountering one is the mire( or savage divide going into there) and sometimes you'll find one in a crater near the asylum
---
Yeah my vampire railway rifle always out damages my bloodied fixer even when sneaking. And you can still sneak with it, you just break stealth periodically. The downsides are low magazine size, unstable recoil outside of vats, heavy ammo. But the dps is insane, my quad explosive one still melts everything

Dave doesn't care about the photos. He's trying to generate demand for film to short his stock in a digital production company.

Kinda in the same boat. I‚Äôm running unarmed and I‚Äôve fixed all my commando perks now too so I can easily switch between the two when needed
---
It's not Mountain Mama, it's Mount Obama
---
Christ 5 characters lol, I will probably try these out, thank you!
---
Its 50:50 that bethesda brakes it even more :D
---
luck of the roll. you still have a 5% chance to miss. every D&amp;D-Player is accustomed to this.
---
Track me down lol.
---
Level 300, i only got 600 perk points so can max out only 2 legendary perks, strength being the first maxed out.  
---
The infiltrator looks like a big waste to me because we don't often lockpick anything valuable and hacking is worst...  
---
Equipping perks is so easy compare to grind 300 perks point, it's half my long play-through!!!!  
---
I don't get that legendary perk, it's a lazy waste imo.
---
There's still scavenging, trading, crafting to do if people want to invest in those perks, plenty of money to be made with player vendors if you have the right recipes, maybe they need the weight reduction perks for gathering them
---
Or maybe they want to invest in charisma perks to keep their allies alive, rather than deal damage themselves, including the perks that give buffs for reviving
---
Maybe they want to role in a party, it's alright if you deal less damage than the average dude, if you're not the only dude dealing the damage.
---
If combat performance is so important to these players who value player choice, then why haven't they chosen any combat perks? I don't get that
---
You have the patience of a saint with those loading times. Is crossplay coming later next year, or was that just a wild rumor?
---
That's a ridiculous price fyi

There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and love it. It would work just as well with any non blooded weapon
---
Note that 5 points in luck are from a legendary perk
---
I don't think it's actually a light, have you checked your decorations or misc tabs?
---
Care to share?
---
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky!
---
It's been broken for almost forever.  Think the damage caps at 5 charges so charging it any more than that is just a waste of your time.  Haven't tried it after the nerf but it used to hit and cause the enemies health to rubber band back to full.
---
Basically just good for giving yourself rads.  It's all I use mine for anyways.
---
I just signed up yesterday and got my Atoms immediately.  Did you buy it directly from Bethesda or was it Steam or Windows Store?
---
Ans it's not that hard farming seriously... I only care when i'm in red status losing ap.
---
I don't know why but I could swear my tesla rifle is doing way better than most my weapons atm it feels better than pre update.
---
its just his personality. of CAUSE he KNOWS what you have done with the pics, but he goes with your scheme and just rants away. because deep in his core he is a lonesome old man who enyoys and cherish EVERY social contact he can get. even when its a prick of a vault dweller.
---
i mean: he sends you to photograph a fusion generator that isnt even operational! think about that...
---
Ha, I doubt crossplay will EVER come. Sony does not play well with others. I'm putting my money on rumor.
---
Do you use Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw?
---
Power armor with emergency protocols, electric absorption legendary perk (first rank is enough), ricochet perk (max rank) + a vampires weapon (I use a 1 star vampires handmade, vampires also works when ricochet procs).
---
I‚Äôll keep an eye out
---
Honestly, just make it. Came back to give the game another chance after a long time and was out of 50 cal ammo so I went and made 20k ammo without much hassle. Pretty easy and quick.
---
Man I wanted EP and shocks for ultracite so much. It's such a good looking set of armor with it's default paint. At least Pale Rider makes my 65 looks good lol
---
Imo, in FO76 you only have DPS. Tanks are non-inexistant, you can take aggro of enemies actively, and although you can be Tanky AF, the lack of DPS if you go with a tank build will kill you in the end. Meanwhile, the "glass cannon" build that was the meta still is a strong tank, with the best dps, with the risk of getting one shotted, yes, but a risk that is not that "high" in practise
---
Medics are laughable. You have stimpack difussers or however they are called, which are a HUGE resource sink.
---
The you have the medic effect, which im still not sure how they work (I tuink they go through crits. That means you NEED a vats build, which is Bugged AF, and it already is faily limiting). And then a few perks that are quite nice, but you still dont feel like a healer imo. Specially since a ton of people run around at 10% health, full radded, and you need to be in a group to be fairly efficient.
---
And hoarding stuff is not that much of a problem in other rpgs. You usually have a decent amount of stash (unless is leaning to P2W with stash purchable through real money) or is not a main point of the game. In Modern FO, the main point of the games are IMO first and foremost, explore and complete quests, then comes combat, and then comes hoarding. Hoarding was pretty useful in past FO because it was reliable to loot and hoard first, and then fight using what you got. In FO76, you pretry much need to fight to loot, hoarding is not possible due stash limits, and you almost always end up in negative after the combat-loot loop, if you sre not a combat focused build.
---
Herd immunity üòâ
---
I checked the lights, misc, floor, and wall decor. I'll try again when I log in later. Thank you for your suggestion üòä
---
It's exactly this.
---
Intimidating, to say the least. Finally, some actually well done photography. top marks!
---
I agree and like your suggestion. 
---
For my camps, I like to be as lore compatible as possible. Two of my camps use the nuclear generator. One is down past watoga near that building that has several in it. My other is built around the commie bunker from the atom store and I‚Äôm just assuming that a bunker would have already used one. 
---
But yeah, pretty limiting as it is. 
---
PS - One workaround I‚Äôve used in the past is the underground camp trick. I would put a nuclear generator down below and put more standard generator above it and just pretend the other isn‚Äôt there (the rest of the camp being above ground).
---
I like the downvotes from other low levels saying its fine...   
---
I am also a low level, no main. But its not even hard, somerset pistol and baseball bat doing its worth.
---
üíî
---
Got the new suit for 2000caps this morning, luck all it is.
---
I would help find it, but I'm not playing right now buddy.
---
Yes. And I say thats quite a shitty mechanic. Is OK to gagekeep it throug quests or "passive knowledge" mechanics, but not active perk points. In FO76, if you dont have Active perk points invested, A HUGE chunk of your options arent really an option
---
I would say no
---
Regardless of the debunked facts, that is not the point of discussion, and I am not arguing those. 
---
You made the bold statement "Free education always leads to lower standards for education" which frankly you admittedly "haven't studied it extensively to make a good conclusion on their case". 
---
You seem to be making bold claims that you are uneducated about.
---
I don't disagree student lead learning is an effective means of gaining an education, but no one model is a good fit for every student, and a robust free education program is not a hunderence to a student learning at home.
---
As a side note. It is difficult to address your comments fully when you go back after and substantially add or change them.  I only just now realized that you had done several times in this thread. I generally only respond to the version of the comment that shows up in my inbox. I am not going to go back and re-read all the comments you have changed in this thread but I will address the surprising Good Will Hunting comparison.
---
First off Will Sidis is *at best* an unconfirmed, distant inspiration for a few of the aspects of Good Will Hunting. It is not based on Sidis' life in any substantial way, and it is certainly not a portrayal of his life. 
---
It is ironic you hold him up as an example, for a number of reasons. He was an unparalleled prodigy. It is unreasonable to hold one of the smartest children in recent history as the example that all children should follow. 
---
It is also ironic you are championing him because Sidis was for at least a time, a socialist, and was arrested for being at a pro-communist rally. Admittedly he later seemed to shift towards libertarianism, but that also was when he strongly rejected mathematics.  I was under the impression you hated communists.
---
He also rejected the  style of learning his parent pushed upon him, later writing he was  ‚Äúkept under various kinds of mental torture, consisting of being scolded and nagged at for an average of six to eight hours a day‚Äù. He further rejected mathematics saying ‚Äúthe very sight of a mathematical formula makes me physically ill‚Äù, and died young, without pursuing much beyond a relatively simple life after escaping from his family. 
---
I am not sure he is the best example for the style of learning you hold as best.
---
Thank you, you're very kind, i logged out anyway. üòä
---
i thought this game had griefers until i started playing gta online a few days ago. you don‚Äòt know what griefers are until you‚Äòve played that game. it‚Äòs a fucking hunting ground. fo76 is VERY tame, compared to any other online games that don‚Äòt really have much in the way of playing pacifist.
---
While we are waiting for the generator buff(which is a great idea),  the windmill guy could have built one windmill for looks and a fusion generator for power hidden out of sight somewhere.
---
Interesting. I've never considered using ricochet before. I Have a Vamps Tesla rifle in my inventory i've not used for a long time a UGL 25FFR. Which do you think would work best in the situation?
---
You're welcome buddy
---
You're arguing over naming when they literally went out of their way to get call it a B.E.T.A. to avoid actually calling it a beta.
---
They may just be late. Mine where about 7 days late the last time I got them. Hope you get them homie!
---
-50% falling damage times 2 is a life saver.
---
Ah that's a gorgeous photo! ü§©üòç
---
Just reached 25 2 days ago and i haven't picked up my controller since. I had the handmade with expert commando, nothing but running away from enemies and constant broken equipment. The amount of bullet sponge enemies is terrifying, what a feeling when i emptied 20 rounds on a supermutant just to see its health drop by a quarter, i could flick my boogers with more deadly consequences.
---
Use those bobbleheads for the atoms dude!
---
I don't get it. You want all builds to be all things? Or do you want no builds?
---
I get the feeling what you really miss is console commands and god mode.
---
That‚Äôs right!! Don‚Äôt let anyone try to tell you what to do with your nuke. I hate oriole like that
---
the tea robot Sweetwater will remember that you helped him out before
---
No
---
Thanks man ü§òüèª
---
You're almost definitely right. I'd stopped enjoying 1 tapping everything but have had no difficulty soloing the Daily Ops until today.
---
I'm enjoying the jump in difficulty again and feel Ops has added a lot of fun to the game.
---
However, today has been the first day I've struggled with my Bloodied stealth commando.
---
I agree with you and it's nice to think outside the box again.  
---
I was hoping from advice from those who had solo'd todays opp on tactics, weapons etc but I am in agreement with you.
---
vertibirds are pre war arent they? sure the army were using them as you were running to vault 111 in fallout 4
---
Edit: [yep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qj5v6bZhd8&amp;ab_channel=LegendsForeverStudios) you can see and hear them
---
looks like its already been added to the Fallout Wiki [Vertibird Page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vertibird#cite_note-9)  too

---
AA and Vamp run well with Full Health Heavy builds.
---
I had the same but was unsure if it was due to being frozen at the same time.
---
But then there would be a perverse incentive to scrap the gold cards and eventually nobody would have any.
---
I talk mainly through a solo character, focused on hoarding and tank/healer builds.
---
Scavenging is not that viable, because of stash limits, and fairly lack of resorces/nice loot. You will do pretry poorly by looting around wherever you go in FO76. You need something, you have to go to X place. Then, you have to prsy that nobody is in X place. Then, you have to pray that the rng gives you nice quantities of what you want. And then you will have to fight your wsy into the zone, out of the zone, and maybe into your camp. Youll probably end up with less resoueces than when you started the whole process, if you fail one of those "checks".
---
Trading is pretty much inexistant in a fundamental way. Is either ammo, or extra-rare/legacy stuff. 
---
The charisma stuff is actually pretty decent for a 1st time multiplayer game in their part. It could be better, but I think is passable.
---
And if you need to be in a group with a DPS to be able to play daily, in most zones.. Id say the game is not balanced well st all. We do not have raids or anything end-game outside the 2 bosses. "DPS" requirements for just exploring the map and getting resources are quite bad for build diversity and gameplay fun
---
There are shop bugs?
---
Interesting as I have noticed something similar. I switch out rifleman for commando before the patch but still kept hold of my lever action for range.
---
Noticed post patch 22 I am doing massive damage with my explosive lever action with zero rifleman perks added. I have got tank killer maxed out though so perhaps that's what is making the damage increase.
---
Get a melee qeapon for small melee monsters.
---
Yeah, keep meaning to do that lol.
---
The one that has me pissed is the holotape games one.  I have found all of them at this point but didn't realize they weren't counting towards the challenge.  When I was just starting out I found a bag with a bunch of the games and picked them up because why not.  Didn't know that having them already would stop them from counting when I did actually find the magazines myself.  Stashed the unchecked ones finally and need 2 more to finish it now, even though I've already found them multiple times.
---
I'm hoping to get a Symptomatic. But I'm permanent Junkies. So it will be for all the fellow Wastelanders who visit my camp. After they fix the vendor/displays bug.
---
Misty taste of moonshine teardrop in my eyes.
---
get gud kid.
---
Can players still destroy someone else‚Äôs camp if you don‚Äôt fight back?
---
Maybe it's poor AMD optimization.  I have a 2070s and mostly high settings.  I average around 90 fps at 1440p.  And from what I've seen the 5700xt and 2070s are neck and neck in most games.
---
 Had a teammate blow something up behind me. Which threw a stray carrot against the signal repeated, causing me to start over.
---
Firstly, if you're not already, make sure you're scrapping all your junk before storing it.
---
However, situation is the same as before - only Aluminium and Lead give you weight saving when you bulk them.
---
Its not really worth it unless you plan on selling to the vendors.
---
I would suggest trying to only keep stuff you use to repair your main gear and sell the rest.  Maybe keep 20 of everything else for camp repairs, etc.
---
Do you get any stutters or dips?
---
Cause I generally can get that on my card but the issues are intermittent or in certain zones. Cranberry bog for example 60fps solid on 4 k high, foundation....45
---
I was doing great pre patch. Fallout 76 was a game i could enjoy after a stressful day, i could choose to go for challenges or play the casual scavver. At level 25 post patch, it's basically unplayable by my standards. I don't want to be mauled to shreds by mole rats while wearing heavy armor, shooting hundreds of 5.56 rounds into enemies and still get rushed because apparently my handmade shoots cuddles and kisses.
---
For your ap problem after running: try custom fitted legs mod or marathoner perk.
---
OK cheers
---
1. Events and faction quests. 
---
2. Finish the Wastelands main story to gain access to Regs in vault 79.
---
Any chance you bought the game on the Beth launcher, got 1st there and switched over to Steam? If so, the atoms are tied to the launcher you purchased them with.
---
It's not that different to pre-update. The only one that got particularly hit was melee. The rest are about at the same power level as before.
---
Vampires works best of fast shooting guns.
---
Whats your current build?
---
It‚Äôs not our fault that all you people do is horde items
---

You have 5 BE Gatling plasmas? Mind sharing some of that duped gear, kind sir? I‚Äôm in desperate need of a good heavy weapon myself.
---
Is the symptomatic tradable?
---
Can you not move your perks around? I had most commando anyways before the legendary perks. Even then just put the perception legendary perk on your melee and you‚Äôll get both then?
---
The magic weapons still work? :O
---
I do.
---
I may or may not have stolen this to do a silhouette background edit. Superb!
---
This is the reason I abandoned my sneak, crit, vats Lady Of Death build. Started a new Junkies Heavy Gunner toon.
---
Ahah, there‚Äôs too many choices!
---
Look at the horizon
---
Ooh, that sounds terrific! Night vision mod on it ;)
---
Yeah its most reliabeble when it says 35%....hits every time. Makes no sense.
---
No one would believe? People have been pointing out this bug for a very long time now.
---
Oh ! I see it now ! 
---
Now that you say it, I have that in NW for quite some time ü§î
---
I think thats a server glich &amp; we cant do anything about it üòï
---
That kinda clarity should be more prevalent, thank you
---
Good catch!
---
Will need to check that with each patch, methinks.
---
Yeah. It happens to me.
---
There have been posts on here about it.
---
No worries! It took me ages to work it out myself so glad to be able to help someone else with it!
---
First have to go through the quest line for the vault, by either siding with the raiders or settlers. Once you can get into the vault you start earning treasury notes from public events or raider and settler side quests. The SS armor plans are sold from inside vault 79.
---
Yes
---
Also greenhouse is the only reason I‚Äôm playing. Seems like a lot of work for some glass walls but oh well
---
I sent a friend request. SacrisMortem is my name
---
Yes. Water farms use a lot of power.
---
I couldn't get elder yesterday solo. Seems the beacons don't power fast enough with 1 player. 
---
I keep getting knight rank by about a minute over. So many bots!
---
I don‚Äôt use concentrated fire and it still works great for me
---
WRONG
---
Are you playing on a public or private team? If so there's a reason Lone Wanderer isn't working.
---
&gt; Relying on Ricochet and a Vampire's weapon isn't a "solution", it's a *crutch!* 
---
If we take that to be true then all perks and legendary effects are crutches.
---
Also something doesn't add up. You have the makings of a solid build that should be ultra durable. There's something we're not being told. 
---
For instance, I hope to god you're not trying to engage 4+ enemies at once expecting things to be how they use to be. Anything more than 2-3 for most builds and you can get punished HARD.
---
Davenport is using you to feed low quality , easily verified, intel to the enemy . 
---
Once you have the trust of the Raiders he‚Äôll have you feed them some false intel that will lead to their demise. You‚Äôre only useful to him in this capacity.
---
Davenport is George Smiley but without the introspection . The Overseer is Control and is always close by. Just make sure you stay useful to him.
---
I do too! Those are fun and different from the events we have! Also the rewards are pretty cool, especially the fact that you recover most of the ammo used during the DO
---
War glave plans are untradeable
---
The key here is that Ricochet procs vampire!  You'll have more health than you know what to do with.
---
Taking advantage of electric absorption before the amount of healing (probably) gets adjusted would also be smart.
---
No it is a very slow firing gun for vamps to be effective
---
me too, fellow mountaineer. I don't get to go back much at all anymore. but she comes to me in dreams, the comfort of being surrounded by green mountains, the endlessly curving roads I drove for so many years, the smell of foggy pine mornings, the blanketing humidity and drone of cicadas while sitting in a glider on my grandparents' porch. montani semper liberi, except for our hearts which will always belong there.
---
Thank you, I do events and quests but I‚Äôve never seen a treasury note pop up as a reward though
---
So I have to get into vault 79 before I can start earning treasury notes and would you recommend I take the gold or share it?
---
I just got the infiltrate card, so nice not to swap out cards now üôÉ
---
Well I am playing just for fun. Don't especially want anything from this season.
---
If i go into the scoreboard first, It sets my rank properly and the bug doesn‚Äôt happen
---
Love this. I try my best to get this kind of photos but it seems too random. I can never get the lighting right and the bodies in position.
---
I'd need someone to be my subject for poses and aggro for enemy movements.
---
this is exactly how I end up looking at my pipboy in the middle of a heated exchange.
---
Have you checked under the sofa?
---
Yeah my post mentioned it when we found out we didn't look up if we could trade it before hand. Still guy is really cool for giving me the outfit
---
I used to use 2x Bolstering and 3x unyielding. I swapped them around and now do fine. Gauss shotgun for real fights, war glaive for normal. Nothing much has changed except I gotta pay a little more attention now
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt sure so I thought I‚Äôd just mention it here &amp; those more aware can make sense of it.
---
I feel like you should nuke anywhere you want since every place will give nuked flora, high level enemies (I think that might give them a higher limit since I am pretty sure some enemies have limits), will give you someone you hate‚Äôs destroyed camp since that‚Äôs fun or will summon a boss. Just don‚Äôt nuke next to fissure site prime or the Monongah mine since it is a waste of a nuke to be nearby and not hit it unless you have an important reason to nuke there
---
It has been mentioned and posted about here. And Bethesda is aware of it.
---
Twice a day? I had to repair my quad automatic handmade twice during a SBQ fight after going in at 200% and 5star gunsmith.
---
Ok
---
Again, that relies on the event spawning, and I wasn‚Äôt able to just wait for it to happen.
---
do you eat your foodbuffs?
---
It's not an exploit. It the result of developers testing...
---
Calling the fact that your use a camp item more than once every 30 minutes an exploit is silly.
---
I really miss ramp season. I still live in Appalachia, western NC, but like, it's so different. There's no pepperoni rolls, paw paw fruit ain't that big of a deal, and deer season is confusing. And Tudor's. God if only. Bojangles never will compare.
---
It depends on the kind of heavy that you want to be. There's generally 4 types - bloodied, junkies/other full health, tank i.e. vampiric or a hybrid.
---
They're all slightly different from each other but you generally have stabalised (pretty important in current meta), one gun army, either 9 ranks of all heavy perks or 3 x 1st rank of each (mostly for hybrids).
---
Add bloodied package for bloodied i.e. Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocols at a minimum.
---
Junkies benefit from Chem Fiend but it's useful for all builds for damage chems if you're into that sort of thing.
---
The rest then is kind of up to you and what you want from your playstyle
---
Yeah, You won't see them until the main Wastelands questline is finished.
---
Gave you a rocket like just to make your day a little better (:
---
I understand. Its nice to have good people in fallout community. i always say its the best community ever i know in games :)
---
Yeah, I was kind of thinking about this. Stealth will modify the damage for pretty much all existing damage increases, so by not utilizing stealth you're kind of gimping yourself in terms of potential damage.
---
Might be interesting to have sort of a, "Loud and proud" perk that gives you a small increase when using unsilenced weapons, and increases your aggro. Maybe you get like 1% more damage per enemy that detects you up to a certain threshold sort of like Adrenaline with higher ranks making it easier to reach that cap by reducing the required number of enemies.
---
Haha, Nice. Fun weapons are amazing. I might just go with that TSE Minigun.
---
So I've only had that happen when I bought ranks. Did you perhaps buy some? When I did it, the board seemed to take it's time catching up.
---
\- Public teams are a good way to make friends if you don't already know people playing the game. They work as described, with various bonuses applied depending on how many people on each team. Give it a shot to meet new people! 
---
\- People do sell junk, but not as much as other things. The reason is that it's essentially free in-game, and doesn't hold much value. From time to time I'll come across a person's vendor selling some junk item I go through large quantities of, and I'll clean them out if I'm feeling too lazy to go get those items myself. At the beginning of the game, it can be hard to find the junk items you need because you don't know where to go to find your preferred stuff but when you gain access to more areas, you'll know exactly where to go for copper/lead/screws/gears etc. 
---
\- Uplinks work more or less like this. Go to place, press button and wait until progress bar fills. Rinse and repeat. There may be more steps, but that's essentially it. The important thing to remember is that while there is plenty of killing to do, many enemies in these locations don't have to be killed. Keep this in mind as the best rewards are for completing the event in the shortest amount of time possible. My suggestion is to book it through as quickly as possible.
---
\- Your comment about things moving too fast is relatable. I've never played a fallout game where I didn't have all the time in the world I needed to figure things out, to make sense of the inventory system and map, learn which guns are best and which are best avoided, that sort of thing. Often, when you're playing with other people the theme is go go go! It takes quite a bit of time to learn all the little details, but you'll get there eventually. Fortunately, there is a ton of information written about this online, and many helpful YouTube videos on it as well. I'm a pretty casual player, but I've learned the ropes. If you want to play together, hit me up if you're on PC, and I'll try and help you out. My handle is fancy\_kitten
---
\- There are good spots for gears, screws, and steel, but most of your scrap needs will be met simply by playing the game and learning which items contain which scrap component. You will eventually spend very little time going out looking for specific scrap items. But for now, make sure you're going into the junk tab in your inventory, using component view and tagging items for search which will help a lot. For me, it's just picking up every item that I know contains scrap I need, and I have no problem. I at one point also had a huge bottleneck for screws and springs and all that, but now that my weapons are all modded to their max I seldom need large quantities of screws. As a result, I acquire hundreds of them easily. In the early game, one of the best places to look for screws can be around Morgantown. First make sure you tag the item for search, and then do yourself a favor and check out somewhere online specifically which junk items contain screws so you know exactly what to take every time, and then go on a scavenging run! My suggestion, start at Morgantown train station, go through airport, through the highschool, then the university, then clear out the open buildings in the town itself. It takes a bit of time, but you can get lots this way, and you'll face limited resistance. However, like I said, once you hit higher levels you can clear other areas which will yield larger results. It's possible that one wasteland may have already made it easier for you to explore higher-leveled areas, so you might consider giving a few other places a shot that have been suggested online. There are other scrap items that can be difficult to acquire early game, but with patience, and like I said, learning about new locations, you'll eventually know exactly where to go for what items. Also, and I can't stress this enough, know *what* you're looking for.
---
I hope that helps you a bit! If you have further questions, you can PM me if you like.
---
Sometimes I do but usually only momentarily.  Usually only when fighting the sbq because of the amount of players.  I also have noticed that fo76 doesn't like the undervolt on my gpu, so that may be partially to blame.
---
I‚Äôm imagining the music from Breath of the Wild when you make a successful dish. :)
---
Haha, thanks! I‚Äôll wear a stealth suit.
---
If you are on PC there are mods for this.
---
Oh... that's sad(
---
Plasmacaster shoots too slowly for vampires. Vampires works best with high fire rate/attack rate weapons.
---
Yeah, I came across that last night.  I guess it could be BOS related.
---
But what if I need another basketball hoop plan?!
---
Having all this extra special is worth switching the cards around for me.
---
I‚Äôve tried overclock, undervolt, memory overclock, stock settings and pretty much every airflow configuration to rule out thermals. 
---
I‚Äôve given up üòÖ
---
Wew, that is an amazing thing to know. Thank you!
---
Unfix concentrated fire, Bethesda. NOBODY asked for that fix
---
Stuff is breaking way too often now
---
I use daily ops as a fuel farm for my flamer. I profit like 450-600 fuel per run.
---
I do them for ultracite 2mm ammo
---
Man, he sure showed you enjoying something that in no way was influenced by his opinion!
---
Yeah, I took Concentrated Fire off because of this.  My %chance to hit the head was lower than center of mass, and if the head was obscured you‚Äôd miss it entirely. I‚Äôd rather every bullet hit something, even if criticals happened less often.
---
I cannot stand this! I think it‚Äôs happening when you complete the weekly ‚ÄúGain XP‚Äù objective. The last time it happened to me it was just after that. All other weeklies and all dailies had been completed already.
---
Yeah been running ops with him to help him get the plans.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been having the same problem. Sucks extra bad when you have a bow and it takes five years to prime it and fire
---
I‚Äôve dropped Concentrated Fire and moved my Perception points elsewhere.
---
That was a brilliant soliloquy, Mr Pacino.
---
It definitely under Lights. Close to the bottom of the list, above the Construction Light.
---
There were two different models, the first pre war one that was manufactured en masse and the prototype that was designed before the war but didn't make it past the prototype stage until the Enclave started to manufacture them. Yes retconning is involved to a degree but that is meant to explain the difference in design between fallout 3 and 4/76.
---
No i haven't not yet atleast
---
Launch where you damn where please. FYI for flux prime is good for the flora.
---
Agree but i dont want it as a perk card. But a power armor mod would be cool.
---
Yeah it's been an issue for a while, especially with all Gauss weapons. I got lucky enough to craft a Junkies Gauss Pistol for my Gunslinger. That thing couldn't hit the side of a barn in VATS. Had to temporarily retire it till it's fixed. Same thing happened with my rifleman and his Gauss Rifle. Not sure what weapon you're using but that's been my experience.
---
yesterday i witnessed a radtoad killing a mirelurk queen in a snap... so i agree, levels need to be balanced quite a bit.
---
U cant say someone is wrong just because they do something different than u
---
on pc use https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32
---
They keep the atoms from bethesda launcher separated from those in steam. Check if your subscription is in the platform you use to play.
---
That would work as well. Could be something for the arm slots... give something for non-melee to actually use. Lol.
---
HOW CAN YOU CALL USING THE MACHINE AN EXPLOIT?
---
This is an insult to the community. Eventually drinking purified water will be "disabled due to an exploit"
---
Do it with public teams
---
Although a pain, I'm just going to start an excel spreadsheet with all the ammo and Chem weights, and have it auto calculate total weight when I enter in quantity. Such a pain to constantly keep seeing what's weighing me down.
---
On this same note, why is Gunpowder under Miscellaneous instead of junk so perk cards won't effect its weight or can't store it in FO1st Stash?
---
Yeah, join a team and have them carry you. Just stick close to the objective and you'll be helping
---
I have a bloodied heavy/shotgun build and a bloodied stealth commando. The commando is still better for the SQB and Eral. But for the daily op the heavy/ shotgun is doing better due to the bigger magazine in the heavy guns.
---
For the daily op the stealth commando didn't do so good so i made a new layout that I call bloodied action commando. This is quite good. focus in damage output and damage resistance. I need a vamp handmade or fixer before this build will be really great.
---
I had a level 57 who started a public team and he never joined, we started the op multiple times and I sat there emoting I even tried messaging asking why he started an ops team. Ended up leaving and starting my own team, 30mins later he was still in the public team all by himself. Unfortunately some people are just idiots.
---
sell them cheaper then lol.  it sounds like work, but i keep a running list of everything in my vendors.  every time i visit my camp and either add things or take inventory of what sold, i update that list.  full disclosure a quarter of my wares is usually pairs of treasure hunter hats and outfits... so i don't fully have to keep track of everything.
---
anything that doesn't sell in two weeks starts dropping like a rock until it goes away.
---
i've found you'll make more caps charging less for more, than more for less.
---
I don't want slow everyone down though
---
Ammo factory becuase i run a heavy build and master infertriater because im to lazy to lock pick my self
---
I heard this post
---
If you ever decide to use PA, even just as an experiment or for a certain specific thing, you‚Äôre gonna want 3 or 4 cores saved up.  And sooner or later people will buy cores if you sell them cheap enough.  I sell mine for max 40 caps if they‚Äôre full charge, scaling down from there as charge level drops.
---
As long as you stick by the up link thing you won't be slowing anyone down. Most high levels can hold off the enemy's. They just need people close by to speed the uplink
---
Im not wrong he's a money hungry piece of shit that constantly lies straight to the communities face. Poor Pete has to clean up his fucking shit. Why do you think 76 was so dog shit at launch. Todd.
---
That's because it's not fun anymore. Unless you have top tier weapons and a spot on build the game is a constant struggle.
---
Exactly what i was thinking.
---
Along with 40mm grenades, missiles, metal chest peices and all of the other crap..
---
One time my weapon broke while I was fighting a gang of super mutants and it teleported me to the one I was aiming at. I died but luckily I got my Junk back.
---
Where is black eye?
---
There are tutorials, you just need to google them lmao. None of my friends plays this game, but luckily i figured out  with google . Not gonna waste tiime answering your questions when a huge fallout 76 wiki exists along with countless of farming routes videos on youtube.
---
speak for yourself
---
Two shot explosive
---
No question is dumb if you don‚Äôt know.. üëçüèº
---
Ok thank yoj i feel really  dumb
---
two shot explosive..
---
even though it should be Trouble Shooters Explosive..
---
There‚Äôs nothing more disappointing than firing your first Fat Man in this game.  I had a 3-star Fat Man and had to use it for a Possum Badge.  Fired it at the crowd of Radstags that usually gathers up by the civil war monument, and it didn‚Äôt do much of anything.
---
Two words. One perk. Glow Sight. +60% damage to glowing homies. Everything in a nuke zone is a glowing homie.
---
As a fan of XCOM and XCOM 2, I‚Äôm used to miss a 95% shot. RNG god won‚Äôt surprise me anymore!
---
Two-shot explosive, it‚Äôs a modifier for weapons
---
Depending on your monitor setup it could be a vsync issue. There are lots of posts on the issue. It is corrected by editing the ini file to change the value of the Ipresentvalue=1 or =0 (don't remember which).
---
Get fo1, saves u ton of weight in junk
---
twerking soviet elephants
---
No way to know for sure, they haven't said anything yet
---
It's under lights right after the Marquee Arrows.
---
It really look like a picture from Vermintide or Vermintide 2! Nice shot!
---
Glad to hear this. I like the BRC quest and would like to see more.
---
The problem with this quest in particular is that there‚Äôs no clear line of sight between people doing the work in the barn and the boss spawn location, and as a boss it‚Äôs a bit underpowered anyway.
---
I think the idea is that we wait for Grendel to come into the mead hall and start causing mayhem but it never gets that far due to people camping on the roof or rushing outside.
---
Luckily , there always seem to be lots of legendary ghouls anyway so it can still be a good farming exercise and once the new update excitement has worn of there will be less people doing it anyway.
---
The loot from the night stalker has always been rubbish for me anyway.
---
Same here I usually carry alot of xp boosting foods
---
I‚Äôm currently able to have 3 legendary perks and I have Infiltrator lvl 1, Ammo Factory Lvl 4, and What Rads? lvl 2 for my character. This freed up perk slots I was using in endurance, perception and intelligence for more helpful combat perks
---
Make m√ñth and cultists friends. Best perk lol
---
I did the same as you. I have survial shortcut and what rads and really enjoy it so far. I bought the chemist back pack from crater for all the chems I carry like psychotats,  etc.
---
Love the new qol perks!
---
If you put a lot of time and effort in you could put 10 points in strength, perception, agility, and luck. Then use the plus 5 legendary perk card slots for each of those and then you could reall switch between all weapon types and have builds for all of them. But you are talking about a lot of time leveling up and a lot of perk cards and coins.
---
I used to sell mine for 0/1 or 2 caps... I had to throw them away cause nobody was buying that shit... Like 40 of them, mostly full charged
---
Ohio river adventure I believe it‚Äôs called. Raider camp near the big river in the west.
---
Not "fix" per se, but further "tweak" it as an ongoing process.
---
^^^^ Deffo ammo factory, just went stealth commando from sniper and it's my new best friend.
---
I‚Äôve been selling at 22 caps and they rarely stay around more than an hour or two.
---
A shot with 95% chance to hit, has a 5% chance to miss.
---
Four such shots in a row, sure the chance of all missing is very low, but NOT ZERO: it's 0.000625%.
---
Im taking 3 SPECIALs first.. this will allow me to max the stats out and move some points into other stats when I get the cards maxed..
---
What Rads will be my #4 pick.. Ill probably also snag the lockpicking/hacking one..
---
I havent really thought about the 6th slot too much since that one is a way off for me at present
---
meh.  i don't really care about the ammo rewards.  cool when i get some i use... not cool in that i haven't been low on ammo since they introduced bows and i hadn't made any arrows yet.
---
but as crap as they might seem, i don't mind them.  other people use different weapons than me, and for some, maybe they don't have the time nor the info on where to farm things like mini nukes.
---
it doesn't take long to just drop some ammo, and it doesn't take much effort to do it in a public spot so SOMEBODY could benefit.  can't count the times random bags of ammo did me solid when i was lower level.
---
i make a habit of whenever i have to open the pip boy to eat or drink i check the ammo for accumulating garbage.
---
in terms of an "ammo currency"  yeah.  no.  major no.  we don't need ammo currency, ammo converter currency, bullion, scrip, caps, and whatever else counts as a currency.  we already have too many, IF and only IF they made your ammo currency into the same that works in the converter, than sure, whatever.  but then remember that many of us camp builder people don't have room for things like the converter.
---
The green house glass does not stop the rain coming in apparently not a major one but still a bud
---
A full set of Troubleshooter's Armor (preferably secret service) goes a looooooooong way. I'm also a bloody build but every time I do an Op I have to switch armor (usually Vanguard's if I'm not fighting robots), change my weapon (I'm going Vampire's and finding success), shuffle perk cards (defense over offense) and pop a few aid items (rad away, among others). I can clear Paladin rank playing solo and can easily get Elder if I'm in a team that works together.
---
Yeah a str focused build would allow you to swap around between the most weapon types
---
This happened to me as well
---
"ammo currency" so like ammo points that are already in the fucking game?
---
No, all the grinding people did for gear would be obsolete. 
---
They really just new a huge balance pass that looks at legendary effects, mutations, DR, and base damage numbers.......then individually tweak everything.
---
PVP is a feature of FO76 so they are welcome to shoot at you all they want. They *are* in the right although you might not want that. You can shoot anything you want if you have the ammo for it.  However, at what point did they do something that made them griefers. We are curious if it went beyond simply trying to goad you into pvp or test you to see if you were on a team. I will concede that taking potshots while someone is shopping is kind of a dick move, regardless, but if they are playing a raider it's true to form.
---
I've had this problem in the middle of SBQ or any daily OPs. Vats, mirv shot, disappear into nothingness with a 95% chance to hit.
---
We don't become the Team Leader like when this happens with types of teams?
---
Lol. Are you serious? You can‚Äôt compare legendary effects on different weapon types.  This is also specific answer to heavy weapons, which is what the op asked about. 
---
Also wrong vid.
---
Its xbox should be seperate from steam yeh
---
Are PTS players not allowed to play nuclear winter?how could they have missed the fact that radix no longer works and the monsters have become all boss characters?
---
cant say in general, every player is unique.  
---
i started as shotgun "build" (was more or less a chaotic hodgepodge with some shutgunner perk cards) and at lvl 30 i decided to start all over with a rifleman. that guy changed to full health stealth commando and now bloody no-stealth commando. and i love it. wanted to start a melee character months ago but i still got many things to do at level 240 and so i still only got that one and am a happy little guy.  
---
what i want to say is, you have to find out what suits you. start with an vague idea like str focus as you said and see where you end. the way to the target is part of the adventure so enjoy the ride :)
---
I'll have to remember that...thanks!
---
Mininukes are so heavy that pretty much demand Ordnance Express to be barely viable as a secondary weapon.
---
Can't even imagine someone using Fatman as his main weapon.
---
Three simultaneous twenty rolls, or one in a million (actually 6 in a million chance).  Are you interested in buying a bridge, by any chance?
---
If It wasnt for dupers you wouldnt have a legacy right now.
---
Theres not even a way to trade stuff, only selling for caps.
---
I‚Äôd like to see a boss event in the ash heap after a nuke with a giant moth man. Maybe something like a ‚Äúking of the mountain‚Äù where it has an aura that constantly drains health, so players have to go in to fight in waves so other have a chance to heal up before going back in.
---
Has to be a clear shot though
---
All the floater grenades!!!!
---
I think he just sends us on a fools errand to get us out of his basement so he can spend more alone time with the overseer.
---
Are you on PC?  I‚Äôd be happy to see if I could craft you some weapons and armor, if you like?
---
When you say ‚Äústandard hunting rifle‚Äù do you mean it has no legendary qualities? Also, doesn‚Äôt a hunting rifle by default have a higher damage per shot than a combat rifle/Fixer? EDIT: I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter unless your Fixer is automatic, I‚Äôd expect all single-shot rifles to be affected equally.
---
Yeah I gave him the German name D√∂delport üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
RnJesus is a cruel deity
---
any player near to the uplink boosts the speed so everyone is welcome
---
Ya that's the worst perk by far. I wouldn't use it if it was non legendary.  Not sure what they were thinking with that one.
---
Nuke right next to the site. Like just barely miss it üòÜ
---
I run a sneak rifle build and I joined it for the first time by myself randomly on a event team yesterday... I had no idea I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to sneak... thankfully one of team members joined and we struggle bused through the whole thing XD. After the first initial 10 mins of being absolutely baffled of what‚Äôs going on I adapted and made it work... it was actually kind of fun being forced to run and gun to finish it... I‚Äôm only level 80 so I don‚Äôt have an alternate build right now but you can make it work.
---
Who says I want to though?
---
Whenever you see a molerat... RUN
---
I get bored easily!
---
Levels are 221 , 218, 163, 148, 123
---
My one and only character is 161 hehe
---
I'd have a hard time if I didn't equip perks or level stats relevant to my character in a Fallout game.
---
If I don't put points in strength, I can't melee effectively. If I don't put points in charisma, I don't fair as well in conversations.
---
The choice is what balances the game. In 76 your choices comes down to SPECIAL stats and equipped perks
---
If It wasnt for the bugs, there would be no way to be grieved ir you dont want to. There are resources to protect you, and people who said they were grieved are Just in for the drama
---
I do them at low level since lv 5 all you have to do is tag enemies and stick to the objectives. I was able to do elder multiple times
---
its called having shitty amazon 20 tick rate servers. 
---
this will never be fixed btw
---
Absolutely! :) I'll let you know if I end up with a double of the plan as well!
---
I used to make stimpacks to sell, but not now. I had a route that took in several tick spawns, and with Butchers Bounty I could get a lot of blood. The change to how BB works meant that they removed ticks from the critters that are affected. I believe that Bethesda did say that was unintended, but to my knowlt hasn't been fixed.
---
An alternative is to collect blood packs. Try the church in Point pleasant and Morgantown Airrrrport ... Anywhere where Responders were active. Equip Pharma Farms to get more loot from medical containers.
---
You can also take all of their belongings while they are watching. In the good old games you take only one single worthless item accidentally and all npcs attack you until you are dead. They didn't tolerate such a behavior, so they must be smarter üòÅ
---
I agonized over my legendary perks forever!! I finally picked my 6 and I'm pretty happy.
---
Love how it really opened up the build paths!!
---
Now the need to run a weekly balance pass on under powered effects, weapons, and armors.
---
No legendary qualities OR attachment upgrades/mods. You're right, it does due to it's slow rate of fire. (So maybe it was a bad example). But my point being, if my fixer has a higher damage output without rifleman perks on due to the bloodied perk, why does the hunting rifle do more damage with the perks applied?
---
Is it a fault in the way the game calculates the damage? Or am I just not understanding it right?
---
I saw a Hindu guru laying on a bed of nails. I said ro him try that on a bed of legos. He said what are you, fucking nuts?
---
That's pretty awesome. Explosives in particular benefit greatly from two-shot, so I imagine it could sell for a fair bit. I'd be interested, but pocket lint didn't take off nearly as well as a currency in the post-apocolyptic wasteland as bottle caps did.
---
Probably not anymore, with L50 roaches....
---
Just to show them you can nuke where you want, regardless of how ‚Äúuseful‚Äù it is.
---
No I definitely can, watch
---
Energy weapons, overall, appear to have less durability.
---
I dont understand floater grenades, AT ALL.
---
I only throw them to piss something off.  They make a cool noise.  But their damage is equivalent to having someone fart in your general direction.   So much simpler to throw a floater over a cliff or at nothing, than to drop.
---
Ever activate a phantom device at a SBQ event?
---
Or throw floaters everywhere in line in the sand?
---
Hilarious!
---
I actually do still hate communists, and I actually didn't know this about Sidis, it's easy to see you got overtly emotional over something so minute. Also I didn't hold him in high regard like you say (I only mention him in like one or two sentences) I just wanted to use his case as an example of what education being taken into the hands of the student looks like as opposed to the teacher taking over what the student learns.
---
Don't be a sissy dude, it doesn't look good on you. Also you speak as if you yourself study education systems for a living. So you by your definition don't know much about it either. At the very least I admit it where you don't. Oh and my comment you cited was in strict relation to the Finnish education system, not the Korean one which I actually have done some research on.
---
And to further prove you wrong, nothing in this world is free. Nothing. At the very least SOMEONE HAS TO PAY FOR THE EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, AND WHATEVER OF THE FINNISH STUDENTS. And as Modus puts it...AT FAIR MARKET SHARE.
---
You‚Äôre right, it shouldn‚Äôt make a difference, as long as you‚Äôre testing them both on the same target with the same perks, food buffs, etc. Hopefully someone has an explanation.
---
I didn't blueprint my camp
---
Used cores suck to buy honestly.  I already have a ton of half charged cores from accidently or game decoding I need to reload my gat laser.  They wt. the same so anything under 30 I just drop.  If I have a plethora I only sell full ones at 20.
---
Have to agree gun powder and ore should be junk items.
---
Obviously, based by the overwhelming amount of posts about this topic, yours is not the majority experience.
---
It‚Äôs a role playing game. I want it to emulate life. 
---
I always run to Home Depot to buy bulk plastic before I go kill Super Mutants with my guitar sword.
---
I‚Äôve ran a Bloodied 50/50 Melee/Ranged build for ages now, so have maxed ‚ÄòFollow Through‚Äô (+40% dmg to the enemy with a ranged sneak) 
---
 I‚Äôm trying ‚ÄòHack n Slash‚Äô for melee which when maxed has the chance of a 50% area dmg while using vats.. 
---
So far ‚Äòfollow through‚Äô seems the most useful and almost makes combat feel pre patch.. at times üëçüèº
---
Yes, it‚Äôs in the lights tab.
---
Go low life, serendipity, ricochet, dodgy, born survivor+field surgeon.
---
Using uny level 1 armor, right?
---
Won't be as good, but you shouldn't be playing Full life anyway (games give 0 benefits for playing with Full life)
---
Hunting rifles has a MUCH slower rate of fire. In the time it takes you to fire 2 shots from a hunting rifle you could probably hit a dozen times with a fixer
---
You can compare them if you know their usual damage numbers. Yes. 
---
Which vid then?
---
Not sure why your not using a 2525 with auto receiver.  I‚Äôm sure you traded something good for it, stop wasting this rife and put the powerful auto in, aligned, stinging mag and suppressor.  All HM‚Äôs and Fixer‚Äôs are way better in auto.  You‚Äôll have to use sneak also.
---
Finger crossed lol
---
As stated stay at uplinks and be willing A) stimpak downed ppl or B) invest in stimpak diffusers helps
---
The perks are based on unmodded, unbuffed base damage, so they effect the hunting rifle more as its is buffed less to begin with. The Fixer will have mods and other buffs already applied, so you arent seeing the base damage that the cards work off.
---
If you have a headset you could add me, my crew loves dailyops.
---
Not Maxson, but some of the original BoS, yes. Taggerdy was in communication with Maxson until the end, so he is sending some people to investigate.
---

---
Totally off topic but do you think the electrically charged mutation or the tesla coils your build at your camp could work for charging cores with the new legendary perk? ü§î
---
I absolutely understand that, but surely that should change how damage multipliers are calculated? That's why they have slower rate of fire weapons hit harder?
---
That's the thing though. In Fallout 76, the day stays pretty much the same. The only time the date advanced in game is when Wastelanders was released and it advanced one year.  Look at your Pip Boy it's October 23 2103, it'll be October 23 2103 tomorrow, It'll be October 23 2103 next week. We apparently exist out of time and the NPCs reside in some sort of temporal stasis, so for them it is and will always be the first day we met them.
---
I find the buffs from food and chems (especially when consumed with Herbivore/Carnivore and Strange in Numbers) to good to completely ignore, especially with how they stack.
---
But I still do enjoy the syringes, they are a nice back up.
---
They have to be good, they're legendary after all
---
I'd probably just open a casual team and sit in a daily op, honestly. Enemies respawn endlessly, and they drop ammo. Pack a few weapons, and go nuts.
---
I don't think the mutation would work. Not sure on the camp trap though
---
I use sneak anyway (useless in daily OPs tho), but yeah maybe I'll have to change to a commando class instead as my friends fixer and hm were hitting for roughly the same as mine with an obvious huge difference in rof.
---
Shouldnt have scrapped all my perk cards lol :(
---
Survival shortcut can be a huge help with aid items, as you essentially get all your food, water and health items in a convenient bundle. Also cuts down a ton on weight being used through aid items
---
Well if you can't see them then they don't really exist anyway :/
---
I've been getting a ton of stimpacks through Daily Ops, so that's been adding up
---
Max infiltrate max ammo and taking 1 for the team (infiltrate cause at max 1 bobby pin is infinite lockpicking/hacking ammo cause Duh! and team cause free damage buff after 1st shot at enemies)
---
What weapon are you using, mate? Is it a gauss weapon?
---
All jokes aside I hate how he has 20 lines of dialogue every time I get that quest. It's ridiculous af.
---
Based on the equally prevalent posts saying how great the change is, and others saying how after switching a few perks around they have found it fine. A lot of others share my view.
---
Those with no build to speak of and without out gear are struggling yes. But these are growing pains. You can't have a build full of qol perks and a semi modded level 35 hunting rifle and do well
---
Ah right. 
---
Isn‚Äôt there an issue with using nuclear winter with edited ini.?
---
I've heard of a few places changing/moving/becoming uncampable recently. Looking forward to some new side stories hopefully.
---
This does make sense. I just kind of feel like the nerf hasn't exactly made my bloodied sneak rifleman useless, but in events I can definitely feel that I'm not doing as much damage.
---
I'm kind of curious; What is that you're jumping off of that you have to worry about fall damage? Aside from jumping off mountains, I've never really had a problem with it. If you've got Healing Factor, you usually finish healing before the brace animation has even finished.
---
completed it even with junkie combat/pump shotguns and T60 pa.  
---
i mean yea, slows are annoying, but just dont stand in the open, trying to overdps them all.
---
Survival chems conveniently act as stimpacks also, so you won‚Äôt have to lug around a bunch anymore. Even without the legendary perk though, I don‚Äôt recommend ever carrying around more than 25 or so stimpacks as they‚Äôre easy enough to get
---
Indeed have the value of 333 cards left(666 coins). But If were to scrap them,I wouldn't be able to lock pick,hack,sell for price,super duper...I mean it's not worthy. And I could only max 2 more. So ok the math is correct but reality is that you cannot scrap those cards and you need between 750 and 900 levels to max 6 legendary cards without feeling like a moron for scrapping all your cards.
---
I didn't know about luck of the draw although I do have t3 gunsmith equipped even then it still breaks far too quickly. I'm just going to accept the plasma Rifle is dead.
---
At least what I'll try and do before giving up on it, I'll full upgrade gunsmith, try and get luck of the draw and try to creft the gun with science master to see if that helps.
---
Emergency protocols 100% 50% less damage below 20% hp is huge
---
I‚Äôve gotten this bug too
---
emergency for sure
---
That's the point, it wasn't right that bloodied was doing 4 or 5 times the damage of other builds, it needed leveling.
---
For bloodied builds emergency protocols. Extra reduction in damage and fast movement speed.
---
Medic pump is only good for full health builds and even then it‚Äôs not even good. It only works when health drops below 50% and using atoms in power armour is incredibly easy because there is no animation which takes up time and can cancel reload animations.
---
Yea, I'll keep selling each day when caps reset at vendors. Don't want to drop for nothing
---
Correct me if wrong but isnt there a sorting option ingame as r3 i believe in pipboy 1 category is weight?
---
Nothing
---
The only thing I‚Äôve noticed is when my handmades mag runs dry it jumps from 0 to 17 before reloading.  The amount if ammo used is accurate just a visual glitch with the round count
---
Just get the 3 commando cards and try it out, you won‚Äôt go back.  Also with a 25 burst fire(tap trigger).  Use covert ops perk card also.  If you need a sniper, use a gauss rifle, works very well without perk cards.
---
Since Patch 22, there‚Äôs been glitching across the board for automatic rifles. Try shooting once or twice and wait a few seconds, as this is often enough for the game to recognize you attacked an enemy. Once I realized this, the sponginess of enemies dropped a ton and I stopped wasting as much ammo
---
Did you say more atomic shop unlocks?
---
Grafton Monster took 90 rounds from a handmade, all the ammunition from an auto laser pistol, and four explosive bows. Completely insane
---
The one where ranged weapons as a chance to explode enemies is so much fun üòú
---
Which I completely understand. But when the guy next to me is using a be gatling that hits for 300+ and doesn't have to reload for a week? That's not level in my opinion lol. Don't get me wrong, I dont want to be 1 shotting everything I come across, that's not fun for me, at all. But I feel like if tho whole point of my build is to be able to sneak about poking damage, I should at least be hitting harder than the same weapon with an auto receiver?
---
I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs intended since that‚Äôs pretty powerful getting full charge cores at that rate
---
To get notes finish the mission to raid vault 79 next any event with an ! In the symbol awards treasury notes on completion, lastly you buy secret service plans from the secret service in vault 79 PS complete the settlers missions till you get the Chinese stealth suit this tip will save you 4k gold bullion
---
Yeah, I did the first robot daily ops junkies unarmed with no problems, it's always the timer that's the problem if you have a proper build. I even forgot to switch to my troubleshooters armor. Used more stims than I used to, but it's doable. With troubleshooters I just hammered on the assaultron while she face beamed me and I was fine. Honestly it's probably the low health. Just try doing it at 50% or use born survivor and keep an eye on your surroundings. If you get four or five mister gutsys shooting at you it hurts no matter what you do.
---
But you can shoot those 17 bullets if you cancel that reload so it has to be more than a visual glitch
---
If you get into a bed while it‚Äôs happening it‚Äôs starts from the beginning. At that point I just shut the game off and restart
---
Enemy's now scale yo your level. There was a change in how damage is calculated. It is now additive instead of multiplicative. Meaning you now deal less damage overall
---
so you mean shooting once or twice, waiting a few seconds and then finish the enemyu right? And that for every enemy or for every enemy wave? Sounds like a pain.... might be switching back to rifleman until this is fixed...
---
For sure, but why design it with 2-4 half-full instead of 1-2 full cores? It feels more like a bug or something. Also im 99% sure i got 100% filled the first two days
---
I wasn‚Äôt able to, at least I don‚Äôt think I could.  I‚Äôll give it a try tonight
---
Oh, 600 flamer fuel? That'll get you a solid one and a half seconds
---
Medic Pump is good and spams stims when health below 50% although it only works with normal stims. If synergised with perks like born survivor, quick surgeon and first aid, you'll gain more health than you'll lose. 
---
Emergency protocols is great for bloodied builds and works well with other reduction perks like dodgy, lone wanderer/empath, action boy and nerd rage.
---
I have a B/SS/+1S  gauntlet and a V/SS/+1S gauntlet.  
---
Difference in hit damage is about 45 give or take.  
---
With the vamp, as long as I don't lag or miss too many hits, I am pretty much invincible. With the bloodied - not so much.  
---
If you have a Vamp/SS/  bowie/switchblade/combat knife, you hit so fast very little can get you.  
---
So, for my everyday carry right now, I run a low health vampire build for melee and bloodied or TSE heavy weapons.
---
I'll give it a go, I have a b2525 gauss their I'll pull out and have a go with. If I decide that's the way to go, do energy weapon cards buff gauss damage?
---
Yeah, 1-2 shots to get the enemy almost finished and then a follow up several seconds later to finish them. It‚Äôs definitely annoying and hopefully a fix comes soon
---
Thanks a lot
---
They don‚Äôt do anything special so who cares? I don‚Äôt even know which ones of mine are animated, that‚Äôs how little I care about that
---
Right?
---
VATS is bugged not sure if it will ever get fixed? Many many posts about it so Bethesda must realise what a mess this is.
---
The clip bug is annoying also. I run commando and mostly really enjoy the experience, having a faster fire rate and or quad seem to help with these issues, FFR because mobs die faster if using GunFu teamed with Speed Demon for reload speed, and quad for the obvious reason you have 4 times the ammo before the clip bug hits if it does.
---
Don't scrap your commando cards just yet as a better rifle (if needed) may drop for you.
---
Nice I didn‚Äôt know that thanks
---
I actually discoveres that by accident, because I hit the stimpack button by mistake just whilst my character started reloading so after injecting themselves with a stimpak there was still just that ammount of ammo in the mag (so no reaload was done) and I could shoot those bullets, dont know though if I loose these bullets, if they're for free or what....
---
I can‚Äôt verify, as I don‚Äôt use Gatling lasers. Maybe Bethesda just wants to mess with weight on our characters even more, who knows...
---
Because if they did I would ignore all other contents in the game and would farm daily ops all day. Does your pea brain understands how unhealthy that is for the game?
---
Taking one for the team is a huge boost for everyone around you. It's something like empath that I wish everyone would run since if everyone used it everyone would benefit
---
This is true. I tried it and they were not highlighted.
---
Please. Let us join the Mothman Cultists and praise Him
---
If you do plan on fo1st DON'T BULK the scrap box cant store bulk junk so you'll have wasted plastic
---
yeah i'd read that. must have hired a proofreader with no grasp of hunour.
---
That seems to be what everyone is saying thanks wasn‚Äôt sure
---
With meat week coming up, try to do all the events you can. Last month they happened every 15 minutes with a big pow-wow every hour. Just make sure you finish the vault raid before so that you may be awarded Treasury Notes. (Other sources I‚Äôve found are faction quests, line in the sand, and heart of the swamp).
---
Also, every week, you will be able to buy bullion from Smiley at the Wayward. Once a week you can purchase 300 for 6,000 caps. So don‚Äôt splurge on that fancy serum plan the day before. 
---
It seems like the reset time for vendor bullion is based on 22-24ish hours. And smiley is like 6 days 22-24 hours. I believe the refresh timer is specific to when you made that first transaction to acquire bullion, even if it‚Äôs only for one note.
---
MOST IMPORTANTLY DO NOT BUY THE SS HELMET IT PROVIDES NO ARMOR FOR 1650 BULLION. I learned this the hard way.
---
Same question here tbh. Just used my gatling laser to finish of the ‚Äúboss‚Äù though, thought that might be the issue. Clearly not.
---
Edit: a word.
---
What level are you? If at or above 20, slap team medic on and just stay near the uplink. I doesn't matter if you can't kill because that's not your role or the objective. Help the tanks and dps players as much as you can and you're good \^\^
---
Rifleman but 1 rank in demo expert adds about 10.
---
I make sure to have grilled radstag or other carry weight boosters. With carnivore,class freak and strange in numbers you get +50 carry weight
---
Hack and Slash shouldn't be vats depended..., I cant use vats all the time when half of the time it doesn't even register the hits ...
---
Interesting, I'll look into it. Cheers!
---
I'm hoping/expecting a bunch of new little stories unrelated to the BoS return as well.  Bethesda does a great job with those.
---
I don‚Äôt get it.
---
West-tek. Or fissure site prime if you have the weapons to kill them easily
---
Everyone got a pony!
---
I am definitely not fucked, my game is better than ever
---
Max Follow Through, max Taking One For The Team,  1pt Funky Duds, 1pt Ammo Factory, 1pt Luck, 1pt Mastrr Infiltrator.
---
Bloodied Commando, what a surprise. 
---
Maxed T1ftT because of Daily Ops and Follow Through for general PvE play. Might max Luck next and tweak my build further.
---
Ahhhh.. ok.  Makes sense then, I know sometimes items in CAMP say they're in use when an ally has/is about to use it, but I couldn't figure out why I couldn't use mine
---
What rads is good, but it‚Äôs a lot of coins for abilities that we could get with existing perks or items (Such as the Rad Arches that you can build or find around the map). 
---
Survival syringes keep us from getting hungry, but I think the buffs from food are important. I could instead take legendary endurance, get extra HP and then slot something like Dromedary which makes a drink i find while adventuring fill me up.
---
Not saying they are bad or anything, just that they are probably in a good place, balanced with other options
---
I wasnt going to scrap them anyways, as it just takes 3 perks to be switched out whenever I want to change that up, but I think I'll wait for some fixes to come in to automatic weapons before using these again. Rifleman feels so much beter even though you have to click like crazy....
---
They need to bring back level variation, where adding higher level enemies to the spawn pool doesn't remove lower level enemies.
---
If you're level 50, you should be seeing *up to* level 50, including everything below it too.
---
Eeeek!
---
What's your build? And gear? It seems like after a bit of tweaking many people find the update easier. Though I did hear melee was hit pretty hard.
---
I've personally been having a blast. I am still wrecking everything very quickly and am gaining xp like a mad man
---
I‚Äôve taken the opportunity presented by One Wasteland to mix it up and go for an all around build rather than specifically junkies or bloodied. Mixing between melee and ranged has worked so far with the new update, and a full set of SS armor allows me to tank enough damage that I‚Äôm not just constantly dying. Just keep exploring options, and don‚Äôt necessarily go for what‚Äôs all around considered good cause I‚Äôve been having a lot of fun switching it up. As for daily ops, just try to get a good team together and it‚Äôs almost impossible not to get an Elder run. If you‚Äôre on Xbox, hit me up and we can run some daily ops together
---
Me too, but a ultracite one, and a b/25/25 10mm pistol for my gunslinger alt.
---
Yesterday the outfit dropped 3 times, on every single character. Lmao
---
there is no list. There isn't time to make one because everyone is busy making sure armor breaks, food rots, and guns last 10 minutes.
---
Gotta sell those repair kits to the children.
---
Yep, noticed that too. I have to exit VATS and start over before hitting anything at all. Even when standing right in front of the enemy.
---
Ah I didn't realise you couldn't test it on PTS but still you would think someone internally would have noticed this? When I heard about this exploit it sounded so simple I was just like, "Did no one test this at all?!"
---
You can still pull out scrap. You just can't put more in
---
Once your weapons lag 5+ levels behind what you're facing, it's time to upgrade them.
---
I love being murdered by level 50 radroaches. Thank you lord howard &lt;3
---
I run medics in my full health build my health never gets low enough for emergency protocols to kick in
---
This this this.
---
Me too! I'm looking forward to the BoS update but I would be lying if I tried to pretend they're a faction I'm super keen on so unrelated stories are a big win for me. I'm still running into new random encounters after all this time and I'm such a fan of that.
---
I literally just came here to post this but thought I would do a search first and found your post.
---
I have an Instigating 50% Limb Damage Railway Rifle that I decided to give a try now that my shotguns can no longer cripple from a distance, and it's absolutely amazing.
---
It one-shots level 50 Scorched, and with Tormentor can cripple just about anything in 2 shots, usually in just one shot.  Even the Glowing Ghouls at a Nuked Whitespring can be wrecked in just a few shots, so usually I'll take out all their legs then finish them off with my Fixer.
---
Absolutely amazing, 100% recommend.
---
The beacons power fast enough solo, did it solo every daily so far.
---
Does take one for the team disable supressor?
---
is there any scource video in youtube?
---
How about tenderizer , does it work with take one for the team simultaneously?
---
Besides, I ran melee &amp; non-stealth commando hybrid build and no problems with ops,maybe you can try Born survivor perk , with UNY SS Armor  it is enough for surviving most situation(Keep around 40 percent of live)
---
It's not that bad! 1 to 2 fuel with my je flamer can kill a enemy in daily ops. I actually come out of daily ops gaining fuel while also using the flamer in ops. Since I also gain XP while doing it, I am completely fine just farming ops alone. The only real struggle is keeping the flamer repaired and that's when I start farming queens again.
---
My guess would be that each tier's chance at a rare reward is a separate roll; meaning if you're extremely lucky, you could walk away with 3 rares from one successful elders run.
---
I'll look up LoneWanderer thanks!
---
I am using at the moment either LifeGiver 4 or Fireproof 3 and Radicool 1, I keep changing my perk cards like some crazy irradiated card changing mutant.
---
Done that before. Looks way better than just one and a good way to use up some flux
---
I don't know, but I don't feel like that.
---
I have 3 chars all between lvl 150 to lvl 200
---
and I don't have any problems with dmg and surviving.
---
The only "Problem" I encountered was, that lvling my new char is harder the bevore.
---
This is going to sound more blunt than I mean it, so I apologize in advance, but you do have an alternative - don't use those legendary cards.  Then you have all your survival challenges back!
---
If you want to lessen your survival challenges but still have them, use the regular perk cards designed to make survival easier, like traveling pharmacy.
---
At some point, Bethesda can only offer so many options for how we can play the game.  This feels like an example of asking for something so specific and niche that it wastes their time creating something not neccessary while they should be focusing on fixing existing bugs and creating new content (in that order).
---
The mag bug it's just a visual bug. The 95% vats hit chance is also a bug. To make up for it, change concentrated fire from level 3 to level 1 and choose at least level 2 of ground pounder. It adds more hip fire accuracy meaning more vats hit chance. I definitely noticed the difference and it's even better with ground pounder lvl 3. Another tip would be to use aligned barrels and stocks and light magazine, but maybe you are aware of this.
---
Also one on a camp bed just above The Rusty Pick last time I was there.  Unless that was a random spawn.
---
For real! I hate having mini nukes and missiles snuck into my inventory. I don't use them and they take up valuable carry weight. I immediately drop them.

There, happy?

Magic Qüòä  I may have one not sure. My Vampire's with Bash damage must be magic as I melted the Uplink OPs boss in seconds this morning gmt, really surprised, wasn't expecting that.
---
[Gauss Shotgun Quad, not sure if it's magic yet.](https://imgur.com/gallery/m5lddQb)
---
Wait wait wait, but it says 95% I should not have to use perks for it to actually be 95%.... I guess you mean this as a workarround until beth fixes stuff... dont you?
---
Also, as said in a comment before, the mag bug is not just visual, you can fire those bullets if you cancel the reload, try it and you will see for yourself
---
*also they should buff the time closer to an hour*
---
Nope, that wasn‚Äôt me. Easy enough in that case for you guys to quickly make a new team, though.
---
Plasma cores too, Wondering why my inventory is fuller than normal after unloading stuff, and I notice Ive somehow accumulated 20 fusion and plasma cores
---
This is brilliant, I‚Äôve got a really closeup one at around level 20 just before I died!
---
The other 3 players were still in the server on the same team.
---
It genuinely wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to be honest. The instant we have a bug that benefits us, DISABLE IT RIGHT FUCKING NOW! Then they do it. And don‚Äôt fix it for weeks on end. Player vendors had that one - for weeks people had shit go missing out of their stash. I personally lost a legacy from my punch bowl. But not less than a day after it was discovered we could manipulate this into a dupe glitch they disabled player vendors and display cases for literally weeks.

https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/48917/~/what-happens-when-my-fallout-1st-membership-ends%3F
---
Only thing i find disappointing is that nothing has been changed about items degrading. With every enemy becoming more spongy i believe they should have made item (both weapons and armor) condition bigger or at the very least repair kits more common as rewards. 
---
Everything else seems a lot better than i expected tbh. Every build needs some adjustment but that's it.
---
When that happens all you can do is exit vats an re enter again, then you can shoot at 95% hit chance. It happens with almost all my weapons and mostly my shotgun. But I thought you meant you commando build isn't working like it used to and that's because bethesda fixes a bug where the concentrated fire perk would always put rifles at 95% hit chance before even starting to fire. So that's why I'd change concentrated fire level 3 for commando builds.
---
I mean 3 of us vs the one new guy holding us up and I get on the mic and tell them. They get a few free runs in, were on ssds so by the time they load into it were on the second thing
---
I don‚Äôt get doing that to people on the ops. ACP needs a level requirement.
---
Agreed on not buying Ss helmet in addition to no armor it doesn't even protect from diseases in water vs the Chinese stealth helmet which DOES provide waterborne disease protection
---
Thanks for the info, instantly went to the vault to buy them and they are lit üëå
---
COOOOUUUNNTRY RRROOOOADS
---
Agree with Marcus. Take the gold. And also agree with do both factions right up to the point of going into the vault, then decide which you really want to side with.
---
I use mysterious saviour and revenant. Have a piece of life saving armor cause revenant procs off that revival, too.
---
Been working just fine for me.
---
Try doing a hard reset, maybe it has not triggered patch DL or something.  
---
[https://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/How\_to\_do\_a\_Hard\_Restart\_on\_Xbox\_One](https://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/How_to_do_a_Hard_Restart_on_Xbox_One)
---
Game better now. Game good now. Game I like.
---
And thats the thing. In other games you could choose if you wanted to deal damage, or barter/lie/sneak. In FO76, you can only fight your way through the game. And each updste to the damage models punish more those who choose not to spec in combat even more.
---
For example, you dont see people saying "charisma/luck/endurance" are a must in the whole community. How many people discuss the viability of fast melees? 1 hand melees? Pistols? Smgs? Rifles? Energy weapons?. No one outside those who cry for buffs to make them viable. However, you always see the "go melee 2hand/heavy/auto/fixer".
---
I want diversity. Diversity only beneficiates people, without damsging anyone. But everytime someone ask for diversity and gi e ideas,  A fairly substantial number of the people that is fine with the direction of the game says something along these lines:
---
"lol, everything is perfectly viable. You just need to have strenght/perception/intelligence. You should also equip X and Y perks always or you are trash. Also, use Z legendary or you are noob and dont know how to play. And you still can use any weapon type, as long as you use type 1 or type 2. Types 3 through 9 are horrible and if you use them you dont understand rpgs at all. And yes, every build is totally viable and usable through all game, as long as you use the same thing as me. But people only complain. now people want "easy games without work" where you have to farm and discover locations where you are free to experiment, instead of real frustrating linear, get this by begging, buying on Ebay or duping games where equipment is restricted to what I like and the rest sucks"
---
As the poster described in their message, the weight sorting is based on how heavy a individual object is, not taking into account you may have multiples - so a shotgun shell weighs .06 and will place on the list as that light, but if you have 3,800 of them, its 20+ pounds.  So the actual weight impact is hidden.
---
I think the only way to get 100% cores is either by making them yourself, or from the machines at the power plants. That was changed several months ago when you could find 100% with high luck.
---
Can it be traded? It just sits in my stash, got it on my heavy gunner so it wont be used. Its an AA vats plasma gun ringt?
---
It is indeed built up more with that plating on the barricades.
---
If your running solo then Instigating with 40% Power Attack Unarmed or Two Hander will hit the biggest.
---
I thought the boss was the guy in the suit?
---
Guess it‚Äôs just me then. I do play melee. I just really like melee weapons. But I‚Äôve been trying to switch up my perks to make use of my ranged weapons. I feel like I‚Äôm back at square one and it‚Äôs a shitty feeling
---
Thank you, I did not think of the stealth helmet. I‚Äôm going to switch to that today.
---
i've never found magazines or stealth boy, if you fast travel to Watoga station and run past the train sat at the platform, you will see a set of train cars further down the tracks. inside is a skeleton with a sub machine gun and sometimes outfit plans (often marine wetsuit, marine armour or BOS plans).
---
to be honest i'm beginning to doubt myself about the flannel shirt plans being there now and hope im not wasting your time.
---
I'm currently server hopping trying to collect the civil war outfit plans and know what a grind it can be. i have been dropping a piece of spoilt food every time so i know if ive searched this server before.
---
happy hunting and good luck.
---
Thank you for all the replies. I appreciate all the helpful comments that are being posted. I really don't like the idea of quitting playing the game, but was very disappointed how this update affected me.
---
The Fixer name change I get, the damage number listed hasn't changed, like most have said. Yes, it was 2 star and now down to 1. The combat shotgun was 3 star now down to 1. Don't believe it? You have no idea how much that upsets me.
---
The bigger weapons like the minigun and Tesla rifle didn't lose any stars. They were "stashed" and it appears that the guns I had on me were the ones hit.  I was carrying around several weapons while playing, and I take it now that's not the best idea. I have looked for videos on optimizing my builds, but haven't found any that helped. If someone can point me in the right direction I would be grateful.
---
I'm not a hardcore gamer as I have said, maybe find an hour, maybe 2, to sit and enjoy. I've read many other postings, (the ones I can understand because there seems to be a separate language for gaming ). My main beef is that I got into video games as a release from the daily grind, a "mini vacation" if you will. I'm busier now that I am retired than I was when working, some of you know "The Honey-do List". I was liking playing the game when I didn't have to fix stuff all the time, like I do in real life. I gave it a chance, but the next thing I knew I was fixing stuff I didn't have to before, trying to hunt for scrap or ammo components constantly and realized that I was spending the entire time doing just that. It was quickly no fun anymore.
---
It seems that this update was directed at and for the higher level players that don't appear to have been affected much. Lower level players it affected more, and I don't understand the thinking here. If the higher level players wanted more of a challenge, then change the gameplay along with the level. The game was drastically changed into "work", and  I feel penalized for just wanting to play for fun.,

This guide explains all
---
Yes. It did this to me Thursday night. I did a hard reset and it fixed it.
---
What I said about Sidis was he is a bad example to support your argument, because you obviously did not know much about him. I did not get emotional pointing that out.
---
You are simply making broad claims about education the data does not support. Every argument you made has been anecdotal or not related to specifically what you said.  
---
I used the term "free" because you used the term. I am happy to call it state supported education. Of course it is paid for, but it is minimum upfront cost to the student directly.  That is a strawman.
---
Neither calling me a sissy, typing in all caps, or ending your comment with a misspelled "boom" make your argument more valid.
---
Guess you're doing something wrong. With legendary perks we do even more damage now, especially melee.
---
Not only the handmade, as far i noticed every gun acts like that - even gatling plasmas and lasers.
---
He tries to scam you whit a bs reward for your hard work. If you have Int +8 you can guilt him into giving you better reward.
---
Yeah but that ammo machiene is pain to use, and you have to donate ammo to get the currency. I mean currency as a reward and redo this whole ammo machiene and maybe have ammo shops like the ammo vending machienes around, which you can exchange this currency in ammo for example.
---
It seemed at least from the datamined dialogue found in the code that one of the BoS members who arrives with the Expedition group (who by that point is about 32 members strong) mentions wanting to get his hands on a Vertibird and the possibility of repurposing some of the vertibots in the area. It is possible that there is a quest in Steel Dawn which will include is acquiring one for their engineer.
---
Same! That‚Äôs always the problem, like ‚Äúwhy am I suddenly over encumbered, everything seems normal?‚Äù Oh, that‚Äôs why.

foosball table (only reward I wanted) has a sound glitch that keeps going after you play it for a short time and follows you everywhere
---
Idk man I was able to kill stuff pretty well with a non legendary fire Glaive with 0 melee perks on
---
This update actually pushed me to move out of my Chinese Stealth Armor and into secret service armor and I've found that my vampire weapons are amazing as they keep me alive. Even in daily ops yesterday I didn't get downed once. I only started playing around the time of the Fasnacht event, stopped playing for a few weeks, came back a month after the first Legendary Run started and am level 150 now. 
---
I'm going to start playing on my mule to try to see what everyone is moaning about...
---
I know where to farm lead. I typically have around 5-10k in my stash at one time so that‚Äôs not the problem. The problem is my private world has nothing in the lucky hole mine. Which shouldn‚Äôt be the case.
---
Sure can't. My 50. Cal hunting rifle is now basically a cartoon gun that shoot out a little "POW!" flag.
---
I would like to see that too, sounds pretty funny. But yeah, it kind of illustrates the imbalance with the level system.
---
My bad I thought it was 2 points to remove, but either way I still wouldn‚Äôt swap it out regularly. 
---
I mean it‚Äôs you‚Äôre build, do what makes you happy. I realize the points aren‚Äôt THAT hard to come by but when you are eventually but using them to swap out cards regularly seems wasteful. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what your level is but eventually you‚Äôll have six of them to build up and that cost a lot of points. True it‚Äôs not hard to get 2 a day but it‚Äôs 300 to max out one card.
---
I used to avoid ultracite ammo because I was always worried I wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up with the cost but I‚Äôve found I can easily come out of the daily op with twice the ammo I use. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever need to buy it or make it again
---
That's just the local management guy, the caravan is much bigger than what we see in Appalachia.
---
Don't want mini nukes or missiles? Here's 16 40mm grenade rounds and 2 Fusion Cores. Deal?
---
Mine are the responders / firefighter, since they never stand in my way or talk bullshit. Dead people are good people.
---
I've been playing since launch. In fact, got a second system and tv so the husband and I can play together.
---
We are really enjoying the update. The game is a challenge again and we like that. Just reached 220, and he's 189. We aren't optimized or anything. We've just built decent well rounded characters.
---
the first iteration of this legendary perk was about armor type: light, strudy, heavy and it was faaar better
---
I have a two shot il take it
---
I can and have soloed every daily op so far under 8 mins as a heavy bloodied build no power armour. Dont get me wrong its so easy for me to die but its brought a welcome challenge.
---
That's a good idea. But it doesn't change the fact that for example all Scorched I'll meet are exactly the same unless it's a legendary one. And of course their weapons will vary. It would be nice with just a bit of variation.
---
Did you read the plan? Sometimes I forget to read the plans
---
I dont feel like they are OP but then again it's all build dependant.
---
What rads: (strong side) I run a full set of solar armor,  for me the synergy is amazing and it keeps me running at near God mode, especially since it counters the 0 rad resist on scout armors.  
---
What rads: (Weak side)  bloodied builds, which are the majority of players in my experience (maybe like 55-60%ish) get no use out of it and will actually make the build worse since it will make your rad management needs go through the roof
---
Survival shortcut:  while it is nice that it saves you food/water weight,  you lose out on food buffs unless you carry the food anyway (extra weight now)  and Bethesda said they are continuing to work on removing the negatives of food/water in a future patch,  if that change happens then the perk will be useless to people who just use it to fill the bars
---
Okay, then you‚Äôll be rebuilding manually.
---
Nope, not powerfull at all. You get 120% charged cores when crafted, so they are only mediocre.
---
Thanks for that in depth tutorial, I saved the video to practice building one of these at my next camp. Looks great and unlike some ufo, this one seems easy to build inside of.
---
Nonsensical garbage post
---
\- Public teams: Just hop onto a team, wait for a couple of minutes and get a bonus for every teammate. I recommend the +int, since it increases your exp gain, but take whatever bonus you want. Also it helps you to cheese the team-mutations (herd mentaility I think?) - even if you are on a team solo, you are still on a team, therefore your mutation kicks in.
---
\- Selling junk - people do, its just that other people instandly buy it. I put 12k steel up yesterday BOOM gone in a couple of minutes.
---
. Why does noone buy my stuff? - its ether uninteresting (sub max-level weapon/armor), overpriced (plans for more than 15-20caps) or your camp is just too far off. Did you connect your trading stations to elictricity, so your camp shows up on the map?
---
\- Daily op links - just stay near them and everything is fine. As long as you are near them, the bar will go up. Once its up, go to the next uplink. the more people are standing near the uplink, the faster the bar will go up.
---
\- Moves so fast - take your time to explore the game allone. in daily ops, everyone will rush because thats the most efficent way to play it, also, once you did the map 60 times you know it by hearth
---
\- Junk farming: Look up the specific type of junk you want on google. If its steal: Just get your int high, geht scrapper and craft leather arms: cost: 1 leather 1 fabric 2 steel. Scraps to: 1 leather 1 fabric **3** steel with high enough int. Add super duper to make it faster. Screws: Colossal Problem event. Gears... not sure, never needed those\^\^
---
I‚Äôve been using legendary perks for Quality of Life, What Rads? (I‚Äôm not a bloodied build), Ammo Factory, Infiltrator, Survival Shortcut, etc. have opened up a lot of weight in my inventory/opened regular perk slots. I also don‚Äôt use power armor so the 3 or so legendary perks devoted solely to PA is worthless to me
---
You have to go loot another 200 something items before the ore will respawn.
---
Go to the Abandoned Waste Dump, I find 2-3 there almost every time. One time I thought only 2 spawned, when the 3rd came up behind me and clawed me to pieces.
---
I think OP is saying he didn't loot anything from there, so why is the stuff missing from Lucky Hole on his own private server.
---
I‚Äôm a Junkies Heavy build and the only thing I‚Äôve really changed is now I main PA. Electric Absorption is nuts.
---
I‚Äôve got a level 21 with an explosive pump action.
---
Made the mistake of taking on the Grafton monster at the Train Yard. Stupid gun broke 3 times!!! The monster wasn‚Äôt that hard but the breaking point is rediculous!!!
---
I play as a raider , my base resembles the role play , but even i to a point , wouldnt grief this way / its why we need a pvp ZONE  where its no hold barred , and u have have fortifications and such that are expendable ..!
---
all it need is comparison to sledge so we can see if its better
---
I still don‚Äôt see it. Are you talking about the thing that looks like smoke?
---
Because he did loot it and was waiting for the respawn but it doesn't work that way unfortunately.
---
Fair enough
---
As a bloodied build, even relatively little fall damage can be potentially fatal and the height difference between 10% health damage and 20% health damage is not that great. The Bird Bones mutation helps a lot, but I've definitely managed to come close to killing myself by not properly taking into account both the (steep) slope of the terrain and the maximum elevation you can gain with the jet pack. Feel free to read this as: I am less careful about jumping  off cliffs than I should be. ;-)
---
Can verify, I get four 100% ultracite cores on completion. Haven‚Äôt done today yet.
---
I get it now. After reading that comment and doing a little more digging in that doc. The game has a 200 item loot memory. So if I haven‚Äôt looted past that point they won‚Äôt reset.
---
Not a problem. Fastest way I've found is clear out Whitesprings then loot everything you can off of the tables. You'll have it respawning in no time.
---
I know it doesn't work that way. The OP said it had already been looted, not that it had been looted by himself. And it's 255 items.
---
Same. I'm not far off from dropping scrip on the ground. And that's with me only keeping the light ones already haha.
---
Max gold, guess I'll buy lunch box's
---
Caps are a pain since I've got to shut down my vendors, making stash space even hard lol
---
Just to many limits to get a solid amount of play time a day
---
Horrible post üëéüèª because it‚Äôs all about you right
---
I'm saying the Halloween bundle should contain at max 7 items.  
---
Nothing of benefit. The cauldron serves a purpose any time of the year but only the buffs during Halloween. Anyone can use it.
---
There's a Sheepsquatch nest south of the White springs. Up in the hills north of the fissure site. Problem is if you rile up the Sheepsquatch you usually end up fighting a Scorchbeast as well.
---
It's 255 items.
---
I'm glad you mentioned this because I've had zero reason to go that far down the map and had 100% forgotten that a chunk of map down there had become a no build zone with Wastelanders and never bothered following up on why.
---
How can they build on a camp that only u have ownership of?
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat.  Starting to drop scrip legendaries or leave in suite cases.  Of all things, the scrip limit should be increased to done away with.
---
Imgr is being weird.  
---
It's a Two Shot version. Says it in the name.
---
Lol, read the last sentence of the post.
---
Lots of dead Utility Protectrons but didn't see anything active there.  It is such a large involved site there must be something coming involving it.
---
It costs 1 coin to un equip a card, and they are free to re apply
---
Also a melee build and don't want to change my build. Nor do I think I should have to
---
Edit to clarify: I hate this update
---
TAKE ME HOOOOOOOOOOOOME
---
I'll try and sell it. For a Heavy Weapons user it would be great opener IMO&gt;
---
Ok thanks, I was wondering why I didn‚Äôt get any
---
Been playing since Beta, have 3 end game toons of various build, yada yada yada.. I doubt I‚Äôm alone.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòcomplaint‚Äô - I‚Äôm just pointing out that I‚Äôd like to be able to spend and use all this stuff I‚Äôve collected (except the keys and grenades, please stop giving me them) on in game stuff. 
---
Or uncap us.
---
Not at all. You're good man. 
---
There's plenty of them around and even if you don't find it by some freakishly bad luck. It's just a cosmetic change to a rather weak gun
---
Okay thanks for the info.!
---
You can even see the rad flies around that smelly blood coverd sob
---
I‚Äô started the game in August, I‚Äôm level 72 now &amp; I did struggle at first with the update (I‚Äôm on PC).
---
I‚Äôm sneak/archer/sniper build, but I do have Final Word .50cal on hand for mobs. I have died a couple of times but I‚Äôve tweaked my perks &amp; it‚Äôs good now. I‚Äôm levelling up quicker too. Only thing I find annoying is mole rats, they‚Äôre kinda janky &amp; at level 50 they do damage quickly.
---
Yes and no. If you put the key card in and they know code and they have used that silo code once this week it's not needed again. So they can jack it from you, but if you just jump servers that silo will be primed and you won't need another key.
---
Look closer, some of the trees drawing further than terrain and there should be mountains on horizon
---
Just saying, from what i've seen, the guy is spewing nonsense. Yes, half of the original expedition are no longer with them, but they had recruited enough to sextuple their original expedition numbers, including a native of the Mojave wasteland.
---
You nailed it with this pic.
---
I saved it to my iPhone!
---
I loathe paying for in-game digital items for many reasons but they are never owned by the player. I miss the days when there wasn't any DLC and you got the full game at that price; not "DLC" cut content that should've been part of the game in the first place.
---
I am there with you. Last season I was able to hit the golden pretty much every day, but now I am struggling to hit it. It would have been really hard ce if they would have added the daily op as a new daily, instead of swapping another one for it.
---
I‚Äôve done all the foundation quests up until the going into the vault one, I‚Äôve just got the quest in Watoga to do with the raiders
---
Whatever it is... I just skimmed over it. I just wanted to know if it was a bug or something I did. Sounds like it‚Äòa just part of the game.
---
Same. The pip boy dmg on my BSS PF is only like 40 more than the Vamp SS I have. Pair it with Tick Blood Margaritas for super self heals.
---
I kinda like how that story is just in the background.  Just lurking.  If they did actual content I‚Äôm sure people would hate it and say Bethesda ruined it forever.  Not everything has to be main content.
---
Oh snap, that would be great news. Cause i also got a V gauss with bashing recently and but could'nt bring myself to scrip it. Thx for your reply, gonna try that thing üòÉüëç
---
&gt; ground pounder. It adds more hip fire accuracy meaning more vats hit chance.
---
This isn't true at all.
---
You can test this yourself. Find a turret (immobile enemy that doesn't move), stand a distance away so you have less than 95% VATS chance. Try VATSing it both with and without Ground Pounder equipped. The hit chance remains the same on both occasions.
---
You're spreading false info.
---
Dude - enough with this. It's not "statistical probability"; enough people are encountering this to verify that VATS is absolutely broken, and has in fact been broken for most of the year.
---
It's noticeably worse on weapons like the LAR and Gauss Rifle, and seems to be more consistently verifiable when taking headshots. 
---
For fun, grab a LAR and go take some headshots at enemies, and see how often you can miss in a row. It's not uncommon that you can miss an entire clip of shots even at 95%. It's not every shot every time, but it's a much higher fail rate than you should ever see at 95%.
---
A bunch of locations got reworked in anticipation of the upcoming updates. Treehouse Village for example is now populated with "Villagers", but it seems like the armory is supposed to have a vendor or a significant npc.
---
Interior of the Blue Ridge Caravan Co. headquarters is no longer accessible.
---
They also said Sunday Brothers' Cabin would see people living in it in the future, but so far all the enemy spawns are present in the area.
---
Yeah but that ruins it for everyone, why not just nuke their camp?
---
I have a heavy explosive weapon character. Fatman, auto grenade, broadsider, missile launcher. Van sent armor. Mixed SPECIALs on those because I don‚Äôt use ap much.  END at 15. Junkie for a bit more damage but not necessary. Just figured a little more damage since I was max health anyway. I carry and Inst power fist and AAE lever as side weapons. Pretty fun. I haven‚Äôt actually played since the nerf. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how the character turned out. I been busy with tweaking my main, ops, SCORE to go on my other builds.
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/) has all the map info you need. While it's not totally up to date the Flux spots are accurate.
---
Well no, but technically yes. The expedition team was sent out to scout out several sites that were reported on the Mariposa base's records as having technology of interest. The last stop on their expedition is the Atlas Observatory. Given the site's true nature as a weather control device that has been for the most part untouched by the bombs (despite however many we've dropped on the location), it is functioning. From what I can tell, the plan is to utilize the weather machine to "freeze out" the Scorched and the Scorchbeast Queen's nest. Does this mean her fights are over? Not really as nuking that area would essentially "awaken/thaw" the fissure site allowing us to fight them once more.
---
Okay ty
---
I‚Äôm using the Chinese stealth armour atm, so I should use that until I can get the Secret service armour?
---
He thinks Bethesda would take feedback from the PTS and act on it.  Ah, bless.
---
In my opinion yes ALL the yes
---
i use kinetic dynamo because i am a full health build.  it rechaeges your ap andbI use dodgy so my Ap reduces my incoming damage.
---
i'm pretty sure the bonus xp is a bonus on the xp you get for *completing* the event, not for the mobs you kill while *in* the event.
---
Yeah, to stop people from farming items constantly. If you go to Summersville (sp?) there is a house full of burnt books that will reset your spawn for you.
---
I use that place and Sugar Grove. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Oh... Right fair enough.
---
Well if someone commented saying they could, I would send them a friend request. Then a private team request so they could build at my camp. Easy peasy and of course pay them. 
---
I sold off my solar panel plan a few hours ago. I thought of it this way. I don't need more than one of either. So why learn the plan when people are buying the plans for high trades currently because their super new.
---
I always use richochet. Negate 18% of all incoming ranged damage. Lasers, ballistic, ScorchbEast screams, mirelurk king screams. And it procs constantly it seems. Basically it‚Äôs an 18% nerf on any and all ranged damage. Huge!
---
As a person who picked up a 2 shot Fatman with a mirv attachment. More for entertainment but very satisfying shooting it off. Seeing 2 fatman fly off just to break off into 8 total to drop on your enemies.
---
What is meat week? I‚Äôve only been playing just over a month and when does it start?
---
What about one for the industrial arm? Seriously, I want to get a giant buzzsaw on my powerarmor.
---
Thats what I do.  Unfortunately I have a bug where every third time or so, it won't open the scoreboard properly.
---
Seems to be buggy. I've ran to each node taking the most direct route without stopping, and I've had them take 5 minutes *each*. And I stood right next to it the whole time.
---
It's not every time, but it does seem to bug out sometimes.
---
That's the best melee weapon in the game and since it's new and a rare plan it's not like they're just laying around on the ground.
---
I mean, they implied it was an exploit to equip fireworks which *are required to be equipped to be used.*
---
Yeah free state, that's what people call it, yet your so called free state has the people of California living in tents full of drugs in its cities. 
---
Listen man where you'd like to pay for the education/healthcare of your kid as well as every other kid out there, I will pay for the education/healthcare of my kid and only my kid. The free states as a result in game deserve to die and the Enclave should eliminate them by any means necessary.
---
Also I could spell BOOM any way I want, it's an onomatopoeia, so BOOOOOM.
---
It's like how I got the Tesla Coils for my X-01 Armor. The plans for it are about 5.5k caps. I did enough Enclave Events, and did a lot of work, to buy the plans and then did more work to get the materials for it solo. I also sold stuff on my vending machines which helped with about .7k of that. If I had to pay tax money to pay for you that would make me mad af. As opposed to spending 25 hours server hopping for the plans I literally chose to enjoy the game instead trying to make it.
---
luxury shotgun AA 50% limb damage, two headshots level 100 super mutants, pretty neat
---
It's not all that much better than a super sledge or sheep staff. And it was non legendary with no perks. So with perks and a legendary version you should easily be able to out damage it
---
Yes, how silly of him to think of something called "B.E.T.A." as a beta test.  Absolute stupidity.
---
Ive had no problem with weapon or armor degradation whatsoever. You have always needed gunsmith or makeshift warrior and that hasnt changed.
---
My camp is between the tracks and the edge of the blast zone. Lol. Havent been on in a while tho
---
One of the YouTubers did a video on it, there's a cave we can't get into too going to be a blood eagle ü¶Ö  base.
---
Yes people can access your storage through the shops. Until its fixed its probably best to just take em down.
---
Remember when equipping an item that was designed to be equipped was called an exploit?
---
You have to fire more bullets to kill the same enemies so in the long run it actually makes a difference. Not to mention that Daily ops are a real massacre for any kind of armor
---
If you're melee its really only harder to do bosses. With regular enemies you can get by but I think they mightve gone slightly overboard. The nerf was needed though. For legendary ops you're best off finding a group to do them with but they are soloable. You also don't need to start the timer until people join you. They *are* hard but thats the entire point of them. I don't understand why people are complaining about endgame content that gives rare things being a little challenging.
---
Ay!
---
because a while back i got it buffed though not as high as i'd have liked :P
---
The .45 smg needs more damage.
---
The 10mm smg needs muzzle and sight mods.
---
Instigating combat shotgun, used to do one-shot V.A.T kill to lvl 50 enemies, but since the update it takes two V.A.T. shots to kill lvl 50+
---
I‚Äôve noticed the dogs at West Tec give you Mutant hound meat now instead of glowing meat...
---
I know what you mean, mine keeps falling out too.
---
I think it would work best as a new mutation. 
---
Strong Pheromones: Aggros nearby enemies to yourself and gives +50 HP, lowers Charisma by 2
---
Apparently you need help about your vision. A 5-10 minute browse or even a proper google could have gotten you these answers. Instead, you chose to clog up the page...
---
Vault 76 is a good place to nuke, make sure it catches the Wayward too, tons of flora.
---
The daily ops are *supposed* to be like that though. Its supposed to be tough endgame content you do like once or twice a day. I haven't needed to use more bullets for my heavy weapons(mind you theres a lot of them) or my BE handmade and Bffr fixer. I don't understand how some of you are claiming to need 3 clips of the SAME handmade to kill a trash mob. If you can't kill something in less than a clip you should reevaluate your build. I also actually think they made it easier to keep your durability up with legendary INT for gunsmith/warrior and AGI for white knight if you can't slot them normally.
---
I find an issue with the fast travel bug only happens when I travel to my camp
---
Yep I unlocked it the day the update got released, liked it, realized people were abusing it, and the next day could no longer use it. Now it's just taking up budget. Big sad.
---
Sometimes I think this game needs more team/group roles. Like any other MMORPG like, a tank, a healer...
---
Seems ridiculous to buy plastic, it is quite readily available.
---
Another bloodied melee here. I was pissed the first day to. But I did some tweaking and I'm about back to where I was before. Using incisor 3 is a big help, and put in all the legendary melee perks, and taking one for the team.
---
Haven't noticed a drop at all on my game
---
Great shot!
---
If you keep playing ops after you get elder the first time, do you keep getting more plans? On the same day I mean.
---
Thanks üëçüèº some great detail on that train set!
---
‚ÄúIt was the dead of night.
---
The only noises were the crackling of the fire and the hum of radiated crickets.
---
Then came the deep shuffling. Like someone dragging a ton of bricks through the East gate into camp.
---
Before we knew what it was, we were all awoken by the roar of a battle horn.
---
The problem, you ask? 
---
It wasn‚Äôt a group of invaders.
---
It was something much, much worse.‚Äù
---
there was a post more recently that explains that the difficulty comes in for mid levels, around 20-30.
---
Also started a new char for the new experience, only using lvl 1 legendary armor uny int leather set, lvl1 instigating hunting rifle along a lvl 15 ts handmade and for extreme situations a ve laser rifle at lvl 5 (so far only used for the aggessotron inside the vtu to get penny's pipboy schematics). Playing as vatscrit sniper with less then 20%hp. I've already leveled several chars with this load out and playstyle previously (about 4-5 chars).
---
Literally a cakewalk now compared to pre patch 22 where you had to serverhop several times if you face too strong enemys. Also leveling up is way faster since you always get the right amount of exp.
---
Yao guai's, deathclaws and scorchedbeasts are tough as they should be, I can remember my very first scorchedbeast near the pumpkin house in beta with my very first char - I wasted all my ammo, all chems and broke several guns to kill it, just to see that bullshit loot and thought "wtf is this balance and shit loot, hope not all enemys are like that and this just were bugged". Now I know how to deal with them I can kill it with my lvl 30char using the lvl1 load out with only a few hundred bullets and 1-2 broken guns. They didn't got easier, but arent together then they used to be.
---
Overall the leveling progress is now way more stable, comfortable and faster then pre patch 22. I also didn't encounter any problems with the lvl 20-30 gap alot of players reported here that should be impossible to fight any enemy. The scaling was always +0/5 levels above mine.
---
Unplug them so they cant fast travel to you and be advertised.
---
While I disagree about the patch in general (I quite like it) I do agree I've seen a significant drop in glowing meat from uranium fever post patch. Last three times I've run it I've been lucky to get into double digits glowing meat, used to get 30+ every time.
---
Initiate Doge üòè
---
That‚Äôs sick never thought of that
---
I've averaged about 3-4 attempts to get something I could live with for each piece. However to your point it seemed to me that unyielding doesn't come up very often. I think I only ended up with one 3* piece. For my style of play, armor is more about perks than protection though. I'm all about damage avoidance, not damage mitigation.
---
Nope it's leaves them alone
---
You could‚Äôve just stored them?
---
Yes. It's a workaround. It's not a mechanic that's \*supposed\* to be used how it's used. It didn't become a "staple" until someone realized that legendary effects still worked on broken armor. And the fact that, if you have to take off the broken armor, you have to FIX it to put it back on proves it was never intended to be used how Berserkers use it. It's only a "staple" to some people because  Berserkers literally have nothing else to help out the build. It's the very definition of a workaround.
---
At 6-7 caps each?  Sooooo much time... Check our Marine Tactical Helmets.  ¬¢31 each! Much less time intensive; you don't have to craft both boiled water and soup!
---
Also razorgrain and corn sell for only ¬¢1 apiece, so very low yield for your time.  
---
Check our my reply.  It is the way. 
---
Also... If you need a set of Marine Tactical Helmet plans, and are on xbox... I've got them for sale
---
That number is kinda low honestly.
---
Do you have a lot of points in luck?
---
I use water farms on my alts. They need 10 more more large water purifiers and some rocket turrets to protect the goodies and product.
---
Camp might not have been spawnd for him.
---
Also you can photo mode glitch threw doors. You either need to make it a solid wall or put something in front of your door
---
Sounds like you spend a lot of time farming, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say OP isn't quite there making chen's and mutations...
---
Cool!
---
Yes but the fire one goes so well with my responders fire outfit and makeshift rhonie helm haha
---
Either way it's working better and I watch this in the last vid of angry turtle. No need for a witchhunt.
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool that they‚Äôre getting reworked.
---
Got lucky on my LL with uny/ap/sent on second craft. So far 20 modules in on RL with nothing usefull.
---
You can still easily clear daily vendor caps with the weapons from one single Uranium Fever run, so I think you'll be okay. 
---
I personally will take the trade off of max level legendaries from the bosses and forgive the loss of meat. Well at least I would if every high level dick wasn't blocking doorways and stealing the legendary kills every single time I've been there. Guess max level means the friendly tagging truce is over. Lol.
---
As a melee build I‚Äôm bummed that I didn‚Äôt get to try it before it was fixed
---
So I got arms and chest first and for all three pieces it only took me 2 rolls each to get 3 star unyielding. So I said man this is easy, then I got the legs....... I rolled both legs almost 80 times each and finally got 3 star unyielding so yeah rng and Todd Howard watches you and laughs when we keep rolling and getting crap. This is why I will not buy anymore legendary modules being it took me forever to get the legs. I don‚Äôt craft any of the weapons I‚Äôve gotten being gauss shotty first roll I got 2 star bloodied but everything else was stuff I didn‚Äôt use. I finally got a bloodied plasma caster from Beckett‚Äôs daily alley mission last week and purveyor gave me a vampire gauss mini so I‚Äôm happy with just getting that stuff.
---
This, sometimes when fast traveling to a camp the graphics don't render in as quick as you do, making it possible to walk through walls as they have not appeared yet.
---
I would recommend sticking with heavys. Though you should get in pa for the bounse if stabilzed.
---
Daily ops and stealth don't mix well. Plus I just think heavys are more fun
---
Already using that
---
Honestly I was getting tired of being unkillable don't get me wrong I still don't die but now I actually have to worry about it.
---
Yeah, this is why I never bothered unlocking it. Not only does it pollute your legendary drop pool with items you cannot sell or trade, but I already have a nice set of other armor that took me ages to get and that already has the effects I want. Trying to roll a full set of SS armor with the same effects would basically be like starting all over again from scratch. Fuck that.
---
You'll probably do fine with a few build tweaks. I play non-PA, non-stealth melee, can still 1-shot things around level 75 and haven't died once (including multiple ops and ACPs) since the update went live. Although it did get a little hairy when I face-tanked a freezing gatling laser Blood Eagle boss yesterday.

A few tips:
---
- Carnivore + Good With Salt + Strange in Numbers + Thru Hiker (or the Grocers backpack) is your friend. Make a habit of farming Yao Guais, Mutant Hounds (for both hound and glowing meat) and do Free Range for Sheepsquatches. You can easily stack those base food items for +100% melee damage with little effort. With the more gourmet items, you can get up to +170%.  Then on top of that, you can eat base Scorchbeast meals for buffs like +8 AGI, +8 END. It definitely gives you an edge for harder content. For melee, food buffs are just as important as the STR perks.
---
- Master the art of the sprint attack. You can sprint, attack, immediately crouch and can attack again though the wonders of animation cancelling. It's great with 2-H weapons. You can just decimate most things.
---
- Don't underestimate power attacks. The way DR works in this game, the more you do with a single hit, the better. With the right armor perks and AP buffs, you can power attack *a lot.*
---
- Avoid 1-handed weapons at all cost. They just suck. I have a few that I try to make work, but my time-to-kill for most things is basically double. Unarmed is still good, though.
---
Various weapons, Vats seems a bit wonkier in general than it normally is.
---
Does ot delist your items?
---
8 i think
---
Furious Gauss shotgun, it just shreads, aiming for a 2 shot version but no joy yet.
---
Don‚Äôt they just have to be lower level than you to pacify?
---
Yes but I do that once I am max caps or near
---
Except Nocturnal is actually pretty beefy...half the day. Berserker's is basically unplayable 24/7 now.
---
It does.
---
They honestly could have just made it a sentry bot and not a whole new variation of an enemy lol
---
Report the players for griefing/harassment which is against the new TOS.
---
Vatscrit snipers got even stronger now, if you are able to max ou two legendary perks.
---
They are playable for sure, but you have to move points away from str so your carry capacity is reduced. You'll need 15 in agi, 15per and 15 luck. If bloodied 3 int for nerdrage.
---
Bloodied Unarmed here. Sure I can't one shot everything but I'm doing fine. Can 2-3 shot most high level mobs and enjoying the challenge. Can't just Leroy my way into every situation. Probably my favorite update yet and I'm too a BETA player.
---
Flamingos are just a good way to measure CAMP budget. A flamingo is the cheapest item to build, so you can measure how much memory an item takes up by how many flamingos it would equal.
---
Wait people actually shame you for launching somewhere else? Screw them, I always find it fun when a nuke goes off somewhere different I‚Äôm tired of seeing the same spot every time
---
I still think I get a decent amount but maybe I don‚Äôt use it that much so maybe that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs still the same. I know someone said something about the suicide mutant not dropping mini nukes and I can say they def haven‚Äôt dropped any since patch don‚Äôt know why. I mean I never pick them up but I guess something happened that they‚Äôre not dropping stuff like before
---
there are 18 legendary primary effects for armor
---
100/18=5.5555
---
so at rougly a 5% chance the odds are kind of low
---
also there are quite some theories about "seeded servers"
---
meaning that every server has a certain likelyhood of giving you certain effects rather than others
---
anyways, i get that its frustrating but in the end its gambling and you could possibly craft 1000 arms without getting a single unyielding one, others get it on their first try
---
I believe they were suppose to be half your level
---
Lmao love how people during pts were saying its meh now it's the best melee weapon in game with one wasteland. Non legendary was hitting col gusts lvl 75 for half health with not even full dmg perks on lol. Things op af.
---
Man: runs around with a stick and twenty health. *dies Man: WTF
---
Hey, if you don't want to be successful in the game... That's your choice. Play how you want. Use the gear you want. 
---
You know how to get better results. Improve you build and gear. Adapt. Can't or won't do that?
---
Your problem.
---
never said it takes 3 clips to kill a trash mob lol. I'm just saying that it takes more bullets than before the patch. What used to be a guaranteed one shot now it's usually a 2shot. In the long run it makes guns degrade a lot faster and sometimes you take hits from mobs that before had no chance to even realize you were shooting at them. 
---
As for daily ops, I'm not questioning the difficulty level. On the contrary, I actually like them. It's just that all of the recent changes have made sustainabilty of armor/weapons an issue. While they've acknowledged the superior ammo consumption with the ammo factory legendary perk and with the updated loot pool in certain events, nothing has been done with armor/weapons. That's my only concern.
---
EDIT: I run bloodied on both my main builds and have end game top tier gear so I can only imagine the issues that those who lack that kind of equipment are facing.
---
Its got the stuff to do it. Plenty of cards in Charisma for medic. Lots of damage reducing perks scattered all over for tanks.
---
Ikr!!! Just constant colossal problem
---
Most of the stuff I run into seems to be equal to my level, but I am quite sure that there are exceptions to that. Just curious to see what the Creature Taming community knows so far.
---
I posted this on a different thread but.....  [This map will show you where to go! Use the red "scene" dots as your guide!](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) Specifically at the very top of the map by the sunflower then Cranberry Glade and by Berkeley Springs Station are the most popular. 
---
Make sure you have Animal Friend ranked up to 3, have a ranged weapon with either the circle or dot sights for taming some animals from a distance. 
---
They must be HALF your current level and must spawn completely alone or you just get the pacify. Some like a Deathclaw, Mirelurk King and Mega Sloth you have to get up close to. 
---
You do NOT need to have any free budget to tame. Aim your gun at the animal and you should get a prompt. 
---
Once tamed...let them run to your camp alone. They have to travel to it in real time so just go and do something for a bit and they will eventually show. 
---
Good Luck!
---
I would love for Stable Flux to become a vendor item, that would definitely get me spending my caps even if the base price was 400-500, hell I'd even buy that stuff for 20 gold bullion given the option.
---
We definitely need quality resources or consumables for us to be able to purchase with gold and caps.
---
Attn: op just store the vendor and stop baiting people.
---
Ah, well time will get you higher and things only go so high. So I guess it‚Äôs still doable. I haven‚Äôt tried because I don‚Äôt want to deal with the hassle them the fucking thing die one day for no reason.
---
I can believe that.  The gun I'm repairing twice a day is a handmade as well.  Use it for doing dailies and running silos mainly and I'm repairing it about twice a day.  During SBQ, daily ops and ACP I'm switching to heavies.  If I was actually using it for those then it would definitely be more.
---
That kind of makes me wonder if my keeping the Junkies Fatman and my +60% explosive damage perk around (instead of scrapping it to coins) is worth it or not when even a bunch of radstags didn't really get affected from what you said.
---
Will have to check it out
---
I dont think 1 more shot is going to matter significantly in the long run unless youre not using the proper perks
---
Yeah I had a sloth for about a week then it just vanished never bothered again
---
From what I‚Äôve read on the PTS forums and what gets posted here. The main think people are interested in is data mining new stuff, running the content first and seeing what they want once it goes live.
---
There‚Äôs so little useful feedback and bug reporting actually going on from the people on the PTS.
---
Just stay near the uplinks and you'll contribute more than the ones running around trying to kill everything. And if you do daily ops regularly, you'll never have to craft ammo again.
---
I‚Äôve had the game go through and repeat all the level ups again, but I honestly have no idea what the outcome was or what I missed.
---
Took me almost 30k for a full uny ap sent set.
---
Teammates also needed at least 25k.
---
The rates are insane and shows us bethesda dont want us to have the gear we want, or they want us to trick around...
---
I looted a secret service chest piece I was able to trade...
---
I love it. Throw myself off all sorts of places
---
I actually completely forgot fallout 1st gave monthly atoms I subscribe just for the scrap box. Been wondering how I got so many atoms
---
no probs at all on xbox so far. was able to just play about 2h overall the last days due to work schedule but everything good
---
it actually does no matter of perks.
---
I haven't tried since the patch (I had an attack dog who was unfortunately no longer protected by virtue of living in the Forest and he didn't make it), but you should still be able to follow the steps and make it work, more or less. 
---
AFAIK, you must have either Animal Friend or Wasteland Whisperer maxed out, then you must go to a random encounter location and find a single spawn creature that is lower than your level. It'll take some server hopping probably.
---
Someone can feel free to jump in and tell me if I've given some outdated advice, too.
---
&gt;Dude - enough with this
---
Once.  I commented **once**.  And you're fed up with, apparently, how *often* I've commented?
---
Thin-skinned much?  SMH
---
&gt; a much higher fail rate than you should ever see at 95%. 
---
IT may be possibly what you say.  But, I **very frequently**, across many games, encounter people who think 95% means "you shouldn't *ever* miss", and even think that missing just *twice in a row* is somehow impossible.  Because too damned few people actually understand probability mechanics.
---
Yeah i noticed sent was doing that for me as well durring the daily ops.
---
Great camp! I covet those glass walls SO BADLY!
---
And re-list all of the items?  Sounds like a PITA.
---
There are much better solutions Bethesda could create for this.
---
Yeah well i wish that was also available for the scortchbeast its self so many times ive set off a nuke gone there only to be on my own or just a couple of people doing it and run out of time because we wasnt doing enough damage, it wud be nice if there was an option to be able to do it solo or just with ur firends and scale the damage down to your level i was pumping a bloody 3 star gatlin into him before and was doing nothing to it, its a joke
---
The rewards from Biv are heavily undervalued for their utility!   
---
Plus, he's a pretty awesome dude.
---
Heavy builds espically PA builds are pretty meta after one wasteland. I run a junkie PA heavy build and shred everything and never die.
---
Yeah. I craft a 3* unyield secret armor chest in the first attempt.  Besides that everything turn into a nightmare
---
Yeah mutant hounds do not drop the glowing meat anymore.  I used to end up with so much glowing and mutant hound meat and now it's only mutant hound...
---
Yup and early on it did happen. A group of player joined up to be guns for hire just to protect people from raiders it was awesome. The player base literally created a neighborhood watch to fight raiders. Ah what this game could have been if players didn't want the wasteland to be a safe place and building simulator.
---
With gunsmith my gun breaks once or twice a day, without it breaks 10-20 times a day. Weapon artisan fixes your gun to 200% durability. You're absolutely ridiculous if you're trying to say perks don't help. Keep in mind the mods you put on your weapon can also make it extremely fragile.
---
Restart your console (complete power cycle not lazy off/on).
---
Long as it‚Äôs not on the chest I ain‚Äôt sacrificing my jetpack
---
You mean half the night... lol
---
Was just kidding, it‚Äôs seriously annoying we still haven‚Äôt more valid builds but instead we have even less now
---
That seems op, but I‚Äôll take extra health
---
i feel you, i bought the plans for both arms and lost the motivation to go forward from there on since its too much of a grind for mee to grind for treasure notes, bullion and legendary modules to get one chance a day of getting one armor piece
---
I‚Äôm still waiting before spending my points to rank up. My bloodied heavy gunner still functions as normal after the nerf so I just picked cards that were nice quality of life like mater infiltrator and survival shortcut. After every one tests out new builds I‚Äôll invest my points and respect.
---
That would be nice but I don‚Äôt want them to overdo it that‚Äôs what turned me off eso it stopped feeling like an elder scrolls game
---
The "S" is especially on point
---
As long as you have the account you purchased it on linked to the PlayStation as your primary account, and have the game installed you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems playing!
---
Yeah I thought that too when I was considering what to go with. The electric one looks the best imo, with the crackling bolts
---
PSA, don‚Äôt carry over 500 harpoons without bandolier
---
Yeah started doing that too. Have 3 mules at max caps, it‚Äôs crazy.
---
I would like a settings option to disable 3rd person
---
Have you had a cursed weapon on your inventory when doing these events?
---
I‚Äôve been spoiled with my Unstoppable Monster for well over a year. I don‚Äôt think I should be able to one-shot everything I definitely welcome more of a challenging fight. I‚Äôll have to re-evaluate. I did equip the legendary perks for melee and added the legendary perception perk so I can add some commando perks. I like playing bloodied build because of the challenge of running in head first with low health but I was getting torn up all day from these robots in vault 94 yesterday. I would run up to power attack and connect but it wouldn‚Äôt resister the damage. In V.A.T.S. there would be times I‚Äôd attack and it wouldn‚Äôt even register (and I wasn‚Äôt frozen). 
---
Glad for all the feedback. I‚Äôm going to try to work on my game a bit more
---
where exactly I said perks don't help? I'm saying that even if you run lv. 5 gunsmith (which is sub optimal for every end game build) your weapons last about half of what they used to before one wastelander.
---
[Use this interactive map](https://map76.com/) and search for "LiteAlly". This should provide you with a wealth of locations to build at!
---
???? It cures diseases, not addictions.
---
I've found the source of the problem.
---
In vats, even if the counter says you have a 99% change to hit, if your gun isn't pointing at the target, it's a miss.
---
do this to prove it: grab a bolt action rifle, and dont wait for the gun  to be at a 'ready to fire' state, but fire the moment it's reloaded. The gun is still pointing in the air during the animation, and your shot will miss 100% of the time.
---
In vats, you still have to wait for the gun to 'aim' in order to get the displayed % to hit target.
---
for automatics, vats is still impacted by recoil, no matter what the % says.
---
i immediately thought about some locations that might be great like morgantown, as it has lots of ghouls but so far i havent found any new locations for farming legendaries
---
uranium fever is great though
---
That's sucks. Luckily most of the Daily OP team I joined knows what they're doing. Like few time we manage to finished under 6 mins. The moment it start, one of us ran for the broken uplink and the rest waiting in alpha or bravo site. One time we had this level 30+ joined us and all the player did was reviving fallen brothers and hide at the same time. He's a Godsend.
---
Like the title says fully spawned in Camp the guy walked out of his power armour then walk back into it and went through my wall I have a video of it I like how everybody tries to blame me like it's my fault people shouldn't be able to walk through walls. I didn't bait nobody in I just spawned in I was getting ready to open my camp and the guy bust through the wall
---
Daily Ops, legendary every 5-10 minutes if you find a team farming the mission.
---
A tip for next time. Make sure you have a hazmat suit or Chinese stealth suit on your favorite wheel. So as soon as you spawn in a nuke zone you can put that on and be safe. Giving you time to hide, heal, run or whatever. 
---
There‚Äôs obviously a nuke zone on top of the event, so either wear a power armor or a hazmat suit so you won‚Äôt die from radiation. 
---
Secondly, you don‚Äôt have to run out of the mine, you know that right? Once earl is dead, the game tells you to escape the mine, but you don‚Äôt have to. You can stay in there and keep fighting the wendigos to get more screws and ammo. You can stay down there until the time runs out, and then the game will automatically put you outside. 
---
That means you have more than a minute to get ready to be thrown outside into the nuke zone.
---
Same here lol all it means is I've invested way too much time into this game. Could probably sell all the gear on my account for a ton on eBay but I'd never do it
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs a cool concept, but I‚Äôm not trying to have another thing to constantly be doing. I only have the guts to help so many things.
---
Numbers are really just placeholders. Could always drop to 25HP or just add a flat 10% of players baseline HP. Could also bump Charisma down by like - 4 or 5, so with class freak its 1-2 down. Making it harder to share perks. Or change the drawback.
---
I assume nothing worth to mention, since the enemy density isn't that high concentrated compared to other locations. Toxic Valley has almost no enemy cluster except the radstag spawn, but there are literally no legendarys.
---
Forest has only the dyer chemicals and dam with supernatants, and forest has also no noticeable clusters.
---
If you want to farm 3‚òÜ legendarys efficiently, nuke mononga mine and two times rift prime. Do these 5 events, maybe sheepsquatch and serverhop. With friends even more valuable since everyone can bast a server triggering 5 events each.
---
Does it fix if you change it to a different key like F? I have a few extra buttons on my mouse so I mapped it to one of the thumb buttons.
---
Today... your winning!
---
Despite the enemies being higher level, the legendary spawn rate seems to be just as low in these areas as it ever was.  Just my personal experience so far, but I have yet to see a legendary in the forest or toxic valley other than leader of the pack wolves.
---
Better option then storing. *turn them off*
---
When Bethesda says "it just works" what they mean is "we're not sure how we fixed it, but we're leaving it alone now"
---
I know! All my keepsake legendaries are on my wall displays taking up CAMP space. I‚Äòll probably never use them again unless they change the meta, but I don‚Äôt want to get rid of them..
---
Exactly. I got upto 50 guns for sale at a time sometimes I like to have a selection  is that a crime? No I have to delist and resist everything yeah ok..dream on or sell 5 guns no thanks.
---
I wasn't blaming you. But there are serval glitches that allow people to get threw doors. Was just offering advice on ways to avoid it in the future
---
I ve tried cutting power people still buy stuff
---
same with the BoS at the observatory: it's now boarded up and you cant go inside.
---
Arent you able to change the location? I did so several times on ps3 as I bought German cards online while I live in Austria.
---
I always put the stealth suit on as soon as Earl is dead as I go around looting my screws and ammo, since I always intend to stay down there until the event kicks me out into the nuke zone.
---
I did that last night.  And then the game literally wouldn‚Äôt launch.  Got stuck on ‚Äòsyncing your fallout 76 data‚Äô.  
---
This morning it launched fine.  But as soon as I started a daily op it crashed.   
---
I just tried again and completed one.  But eeeeesh
---
I made 2 new characters just to use the legacies I have that I wasn't using on my main so I get you man. Weird to have played since beta. The game started rough, and it's still pretty bad.. but I've loved it the whole time üòÇ
---
This just prevents your vendor from showing up on the map. If someone wanders by your de-powered vendors, they can still shop at them.
---
So i need to repair my weapon 3 times a day? Oh no! How ever will I survive???? Stop being dumb, its blatantly op needing to repair your weapon like once a day. God forbid you need to use like 3 adhesive more than usual.
---
I think its good full health builds get some love.
---
Mind you it's kind of a tax, as that's more dps you are losing.
---
youre not really mid level. you might be lower compared to other vet players, but youre way past the soft cap, you have all skill points, access to all perks, can use all gear, etc. mid level refers to like 20-40. you cant have an optimized build if you cant even use all the gear or have all the best perks.
---
mayb u should git gud at comments
---
I'm thinking Follow Through is the only legendary perk that's not a SPEICAL that I'm going to be using. Right now I have FT and Sizzling Style, but I'm thinking of dumping that for a SPECIAL one too. IMO the strongest cards are the plainest looking ones.
---
Welcome and good luck! Its HELLA tedious sometimes. If you don't find what you want server hop...again and again and again... lol
---
Yeah. Can‚Äôt seem to quit! Took a 2 week break after finishing S1 waiting for patch 22 and that helped, invigorated me a bit.
---
lmao well you clearly miss the point or are just being dumb yourself. have a good day.
---
How do you get the mods?
---
Oh no, he got robbed!! Quick, call the score police!
---
Seriously, get used to bugs with this game. What you experienced was nothing compared to the full weekly autocomplete bug others had MULTIBLE weeks.
---
Go write a ticket, no one here is able to help anyway. Bethesda don't do anything aswell, at least they didn't done anything for these poor guys who lost 10k score at once for weeks straight, unable to get any score at all except the repeatable gain xp one.
---
awesome, thank you
---
This is exactly how I got my t60 jetpack plan for 10 caps lol
---
Not my fault if you can't explain yourself effectively.
---
Ah thats much more reasonable.  My bad.
---
How do you feel about the damage adjustment?
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs explosive baits? They aren‚Äôt that powerful, you need a shit load to do damage of a nuke. Also i crafted a few yesterday and tossed them on the ground, they simply never go off.
---
Your point is wrong as this person is literally arguing for stronger weapons because they know a level 35 weapon won‚Äôt cut the mustard. Many level 50 weapons do not cut the mustard now.
---
I wish there were still some living Free States folks. Their story was most interesting to me: they were shunned by their community before the war, and then turned around and helped that community after the bombs fell. They could just as easily have stayed hidden in their bunkers but they turned Harpers Ferry into a refuge. For a while, at least, until the Scorched plague ruined everything.
---
Well my 3 bloodied builds aren‚Äôt a amazing as they were - especially my tanky melee - but it‚Äôs made the game more interesting again. I‚Äôm dying a bit more, using stimpacks again.
---
Overall I don‚Äôt mind it. I do, however, have an gripe about level 50 molerats and roaches. That‚Äôs just unnecessary!
---
Dude, I love the legendary perks, my vendor has pretty much-been meds and ammo and now I just pump so much ammo out its great
---
Spec ops has 50% less durability reduce.
---
Also, durability is affected by resistance of enemys. Your gun breaks faster when used on tought enemys.
---
Then deal with selling stuff and getting nothing for it . I‚Äôm simply telling you to instead of saying a guy glitched through a wall there is a simple fix. Store YOUR VENDORS. Or lose stuff. You think Bethesda is going to fix it? No they won‚Äôt and being they won‚Äôt I‚Äôm letting you know what to do but you don‚Äôt want to so have fun and see where it gets you. Have a awesome day
---
Same here with all shotguns
---
You can buy them from Regs in the vault, 200 gold each
---
Already did, multiple times with heavy evidence. They are still playing every day
---
Ha that reads like a proper piece of wasteland lore üòç
---
Bethesda knows. We told them on the PTS forum that the super reactor was not super in any way. There were some good suggestions to make it better, but they were all ignored.
---
The fact I need to immediately open my inventory and drop ammo after getting a reward from completing something tells me something needs to change.
---
I've noticed that if something was looted in Adventure and you hop to a private server, the thing in question is still looted. This was before patch 22. Going to the location in Adventure makes a difference. I suspect that they use your last session as a template when loading the private server.
---
100%, on pc they have access to third party softwares and can craft special guns. Those guns shoot dozens of Baites at a time. Already sent proof to Bethesda. They did nothing
---
No, like, you sit and use it you can then sit and use it again. Stacking your strength buffs infinitely. Only downside is you have 30 min before it ends
---
What do you mean? All you have to do is stack up 3 of them and you get 100 ammo points at the converter. It's only 18 pounds. Or wait till you have 300 to turn in, since the ammo converter interface is a bit unwieldly.
---
Someone posted how enemies in the 15 to 2x range have way too much hit points compared to other level enemies. 
---
Bethesda is "aware" of this issue.
---
Yeah I noticed that too for my first paladin clear. It might also be that they are monitoring your time so some larger number of significant figures than they can display. So if you finish in 7 minutes and 59.683 seconds that rounds up to 8m00s. But your time is technically less than 8m00s
---
Assuming you‚Äôre located in a densely populated locale?
---
Yeah I agree with the roaches. Surprised me the first time I saw them tbh lol they still die with a bash or 2 though. And yes, my melee bloodied took a huge hit. Stopped using the unstoppable monster to use a 1* instigating DCG because it does more damage. I was pretty peeved about that early on considering I started playing bloodied unarmed in January after release date. But other than that I've been enjoying it too. Only real bad part is I have to stay way more ontop of my ammo now lol
---
Infertriater is a new step.
---
I think it's just plasmas in general. Idk
---
üò±üò±üòÇ
---
Nice
---
In short. You want god mode
---
Considering how many things were broken from last season it is just plain stupid not to have the new stuff tested in the PTS. They obviously do a poor job themselves and nearly everything even Atomic Shop stuff has some issue. At the same time though, they are bad at even listening to feedback.
---
I'm concerned about fps but we'll see.
---
I don‚Äôt often read the patch notes, man was I surprised to see the blood eagles took over hawkes refuge. That‚Äôs one place I used to successfully farm for legendaries.
---
If you're going to make an argument, at least learn to spell and use proper language. 
---
Besides, I'm not looking for a fix. I'm looking to see if anyone else had a similar issue. 
---
Sad you've had so many bugs. I haven't experienced many at all. So much for your "PC Master Race". Have a day!
---
Someone suggested a Legendary perk like this on the PTS forum:
---
**Get Away From Her You B###h:** VATS criticals force an enemy to focus their attention on you for 2/4/6/8 seconds.
---
I was thinking the same thing about pistols.  But I would also like a way to have 2 one handed melee weapons too.  Either swords or gauntlets (power fists) would be sooo awesome too since there currently aren't shields to put in my other hand anyway.
---
I have explained myself pretty well and your last reply implies that you have got what my point is. You're just saying that even if you realize that your gear breaks faster it's not a problem for you. Sure, if you have access to unlimited mats then it's clearly not a problem but, you know, not everyone has access to scrapbox and/or can buy repair kits. I've been playing since beta and items condition has never been an issue for me until now.
---
This is the way of the wise
---
I enjoy the rifleman stealth but I was doing pathetic damage at level 60 and then I started messing around so my stats are somewhat chaotic now at level 90.  I like the build but I didnt have a good weapon and then I found a great shotgun and down the rabbit hole I went.
---
so many of these comments show a complete lack of reading comprehension skills, my god. either that or a refusal to actually read, they just see criticism of bethesda and white knight their asses off.
---
Thank you to the wonderful u/zenrar for the award!! ‚ô• I appreciate your kindness!
---
Gotcha, I‚Äôve never seen anything like that on PS4.
---
How can they access it? Is this for Ps4 as well?
---
It's simple. Whoever went through the silo can launch wherever they please. They could even nuke my camp but I'd prefer they didn't.
---
Do we play the same game? Someone who is saying fallout76 has almost no bugs must be crazy.
---
You can keep all spellings you encounter, i dont care about them at all.
---
Makes sense, why would someone play it on a pts when it hasn't gotten a big update in a year or so
---
Isn‚Äôt fallout 76 just one giant PTS though
---
The lighting in this game is so incredible IMO.
---
You should be in profit for bullets but thanks for heads up.
---
I really wish I knew that. It was my first time doing the event. Thank you
---
8 minutes solo
---
No no, I appreciate YOUR kindness for doing your part making this community a bit better informed.
---
You sure? I haven‚Äôt tried that I did get disconnected once going around looting ammo and game kicked to dashboard and I don‚Äôt think I got anything. But thanks for the notice I will make sure to get out before timer runs out
---
Can t enter by the door..
---
I think you've hit the nail on the head, tbh. It's too specific a shape and it REALLY seems to require a flat space. Yer on to something!
---
Not to gloat but the only thing I really notice since the update is getting more XP per kill. It is nice having poison resistance in power armor finally though.
---
You, sir, madam, attack helicopter, are a godsend. Thank you!
---
No, it's a once a day drop chance sadly
---
Because they're bullion items which are treated the same as atom shop items and are destroyed when dropped instead of left on the ground.  If the warning didn't exist you'd have people every other day they accidentally dropped their god rolled secret service armor or gauss minigun.
---
The real complaint should be that they're in the loot table at all.
---
You can‚Äôt trade SS
---
No timer either, just *poof* I got booted out of the area and back to the map.
---
Are you on pc?
---
Do you run Power armor?   If not give it a try.  The additional protection is huge.  Secondly check your Perk loadout.  Changes there can have a big impact.  We all play the game differently so try to mix it up a bit. 
---
For frame of reference I am level 600 and used to not die very often.  Now it happens more often.   The change is noticeable but not game breaking.  I also am a mutt build.  I have no God Roll weapons and run the same excavator power armor from the start of the game.  If you are on PC I could give you some guns that would make it a little easier.
---
No wonder i never noticed this bug, I always shoot short bursts like 2-3 rounds at a time. Heavy energy guns however still reload when there‚Äôs more than a hundred rounds left, totally effing annoying.
---
It barely takes even basic mats to repair a weapon. Is it that hard for you to get 10 adhesive a day or do SBQ to get repair kits? I don't understand what you do in this game if you can't afford the basic mats to repair a weapon.
---
Running daily ops now and then solves any ammo problems. I don't know what to do with all the ammo.
---
I was running around collecting all that sweet sweet 5mm but I missed out on the big cash of 5mm in the rewards.
---
I think photos in fallout get overlooked. I started to purposefully snap photos here and there in appalachia. Tyler county fairground in black and white or sepia was my favorite so far
---
Nuke where the hell u want, I nuke trap camps sometimes. Plus most experience players are probably bored of grinding earl or SBQ, just for average legendary rewards. Since one wasteland, grinding xp is easier than end game etc play the game how u want to.
---
It should be on average 1/# of primary legendary effects, so pretty close to what you got.
---
Build alone isn't the problem.  My build isn't nearly optimized, [I'm personally collecting DR instead of damage (no PA)](https://i.imgur.com/ZjtL1wo.png) and even with all those damage perks missed out, I can solo my daily ops without a damage prefix legendary (I use quad).  I think it's more to do with the insane HP curve for enemies level 15-40, and the huge disparity between weapons.  Pistols have always been oof, and non-auto rifles get killed by damage falloff to an insane degree.  The weapon disparity is a much bigger damage issue than build, honestly, and I hope Bethesda brings other weapons up to par with automatic rifles.  That would probably ease a lot of struggles, along with smoothing out the HP curve I mentioned earlier..
---
I wouldn't say that. I'm level 156, and have been playing since BETA, and I kinda miss one-shotting enemies in the Forest Region for easy achievements. I wouldn't say One Wasteland ruined the experience entirely, but ammo consumption is kind of ridiculous now and I don't want to have to grind for ammo (or the scrap for it) when I can only play for a couple hours a week.
---
I don‚Äôt want god mode, I can accept dying, I can accept challenge, but I don‚Äôt want the whole game to be a grind.
---
Yeah i think so. Cause they ain't dropping like that anymore as far i know.
---
...i mean: Yes
---
Maybe I was high... ü§î
---
I'm sorry, what.
---
Uh doh! Blame it on me getting confused you are right of course.
---
That sucks.  I wish there was cross platform.  I have a ton of screws, but I can't give them to you :(
---
Sounds nice, you'll have to post it!
---
Listen man i hear you just play casually and enjoy it i don't see what your problem really is i was a stealth rifle build, wish i went to commando early on do to rifles bieng usless now but i didn't sure im also a heavy weapons build as well but i dont use that unless an event calls for it...so what do i do now hmm guess it gave me a reason to push from lev 130 and get commando perks as well as far as i see it you are complaining about a game bieng a challenge becouse you dont have the time to put in well guess what its an mmo if it doesnt change it dies and gets boring so my advise to you is live with it or go play fallout 4 or something
---
Managed to find an anti armor explosive handmade. Maybe i can make a build around that?
---
its incentive to carry a lightweight Fat Man or ML for that very reason.  Sometimes its just fun to blow shit up.
---
There are communities of griefers just like there are communities of exploiters that share info and jump into games after patches to take advantage of their discoveries. They love doing it, it gives them a feeling superiority.  Many are young and some will grow out of it, but some never do.  If you play mmo's style games especially you are going to see it.  Whether you tolerate it or not is up to you.
---
I love the game and had a lot of help, it's only fair I return the favor. You made my day, thank you.
---
Agree that you can still max out the vendor from weapons, but that means more weapon hunting for steel scrap. But I agree I'll take the loss in exchange for max enemies.
---
Sorry to hear the tagging has vanished for you, I've still been lucky people are tagging and sharing when I've shown up.
---
Its all good, It won't kill me (I dont think atleast)
---
Thank you though, I appreciate the kindness.
---
So do the classic pullover:
---
Tell them you will launch it at Monongah and then launch it where you want. Then they won‚Äôt steal it
---
I'm not crazy. I'm telling you my experience. 76 has been exponentially better for consoles than it has for PC in terms of bugs. Maybe you should consider switching. Unless you're just too good for that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks pal, I only use power armor every now and then, but for rp reasons I don‚Äôt want to wear power armor all the time, thanks for the input, I‚Äôll check my perk load out and see if I can make it work a bit better.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, but thanks for the offer!
---
Was there anything special there before?  I don't think so.
---
thats wrong. most of us just dont have access to all the perks and gear we need yet. im not a ~hArDcOrE gAmEr~ but ive always done sensible specialized builds. my mid level toon that is suffering the most is a melee/pa build (going to be heavy gunner as well but i JUST started unlocking perks for those so ive had to use commando for groups of mobs). my lvl 65 is a stealth rifleman and gasnt been hit hard, hust noticed things take a couple more shots now. ill have to get more serious about using headshots now is all.
---
A BOS mission location.
---
So don't do it all the time, but if you only switch a card once every few months, it's fine.
---
Maybe, I didn‚Äôt give daily ops a go yet, but that‚Äôs only because I got wrecked walking out of my camp, and I was a bit disillusioned and I thought that the daily ops would be the same.
---
Daily Ops aren't new content or fresh content and I really wish people would stop pretending they are either.
---
Welcome to MMO‚Äôs.
---
Equally possible it was the camera glitch. I did this yesterday to get into a locked bedroom. His point is a valid one
---
I have only launched one nuke, I was around level 60, and I targeted the most Camps I could ( I think there were 4 or 5) near Whitesprings, because life in the wasteland is hard, people can be dicks,  and you need to be on your toes.
---
I have not found any new areas. I have found sometimes my normal route like whitesprings will have none of I can find 4 to 5. Wes tek seems to barely have any also. If I can get on a server with ppl nuking and taking on the boss it‚Äôs better then running around anymore. And like another said daily ops is good to get some. For those that have ran it more, do you still get legendaries after finishing all ranks? Idk being I only play until I beat elder
---
Thats nice of him!
---
basic mats? do you only use pipe guns and wood armor lol? I prefer playing events as I've always done rather than go scavenge for circuitry and other exotic mats. Again, if that's what you find entertaining, then go for it. I'm not trying to convince you. Just don't dismiss my point as if it wasn't a problem cause for many people it clearly is.
---
Looks cooler.
---
Less noise.
---
Harder to break.
---
Different components.
---
Turrets on top have smaller blind spots.
---
Ammo is ridiculously easy to maintain now with the new legendary perk and getting the ammo you use back from events.
---
I sell my excess scrip, grenades, and other stuff to vendors....if I hit max caps, I buy recall cards.
---
I also drop anything I can‚Äôt sell or use, like the floater grenades or crap SS Armor or bullion weapons.
---
Well the new ammo legendary perk is brilliant for that.. 2000 gunpowder got me 30k 556 and 20k 45!
---
The idea is good, and I support it on paper.
---
But, as we know bethesda can't do anything without screwing it up, I rather wouldn't recommend to change it now. To many problems to the balance and bugs will occur.
---
Also I don't believe the vast majority of the players would like negative effects in any way, and games like division 2 got also heavy criticism for adding weapon attachments that gain a 10% bonus but decreases some other stat for 5%.
---
The shitstorm would be huge for sure.
---
I couldn‚Äôt believe it, when I couldn‚Äôt find my gun I thought ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way anyone is gonna give that back to me‚Äù
---
Poison resistance if you don't have it, electric absorption if in power armor, specials, etc.
---
I ran the event 3 times yesterday and got a bunch. I‚Äôm on Xbox if you need any let me know.
---
Oh, I love this! The vertibots in the back are sick!
---
I found this out the other day, during special ops event, and when they work I can't fire, or they turn on when I go to melle something and I can't hit anything. As they say after every patch 10 steps forward, 20 steps üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è backwards. Just like a game of Deathclaws and ladders. Lol. I am assuming it will be patched in the next couple of months.
---
I do wish you all the best üëç I apologize for being abit of a smart ass, It's in my nature.  I am sure it will be resolved in the near future.
---
I just figured that out last night. It's definitely not as difficult as it used to be. It's probably a more noticeable difficulty for those who don't have a lot of time to dedicate to gameplay
---
Yeah future content in effect
---
They put Lucky Hole on a special cool down... It's a 20 hour reset I believe.
---
Circuitry is fairly easy to get. Nothing in this game is hard to get honestly. I dont understand what you're using that takes so much of these easy to get mats that you cant repair them.
---
Pay for just one month of 1st,and spend that month stuffing the scrapbox as full as you can. When your membership ends, you can't put anything IN the box anymore, but you can take whatever you want OUT
---
The only enemy I find harder than normal is the Level 100 Mirelurk Queen....she‚Äôs a complete badass now.
---
I‚Äôm happy to be fearful of something again.
---
Crouch = double damage.  Aim for the head = double damage.  Win.
---
Join events with other people.  Turn scrip into legendaries at the purveyor.
---
are you bloodied or full health?
---
We already have a pretty complicated system of perks, chems, food buffs and mutations.  I think they just need to work on fixing what we've got.
---
Well technically he is because it was a big thing pre-launch at how you don't have to pay anything beyond the sticker price to have everything in the game and that "You can get atoms just by playing!" which they are walking back already. Don't even try to argue they aren't walking it back, they GUTTED Atom rewards for daily/weekly challenges in favor of atom shop reject skins on a fancy background.
---
Of course the bootlickers in this community just accept Bethesda constantly chipping away at what they sold this game on and actually defend the practice.
---
[This is a (kind of) Wastelander's Walkthru](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/Wastelanders_Walkthrough_and_Main_Quests) so to speak. This should help you navigate the whole adventure by telling you which quests you need to pick up and from which side. It's not explicit but you should be able to google the actual quests from there!
---
If you try real hard, [you can be one hell of a non-PA tank.](https://i.imgur.com/ZjtL1wo.png)  I run this character with empath, team medic, taking one for the team, and hopefully soon, full Solar armor.  I swear, getting an aggro perk/mutation would make me cry the most glorious tears!
---
Like you said you only had one guy with you and neither of you had incredible weapons. I think you were just a bit unlucky with the instancing. :(
---
I'm usually not that worried about me getting in on the tagging, just annoying since one day they had kill a legendary enemy score chore and I went 0/3 in Uranium Fever lol. I've still got scrip for days after that last sale so I didn't need them either. Just seemed to be a lot more competition for them that day and the next 2 times I went back. As long as I get my legendaries from daily ops I won't worry about world drops too much.
---
Ouch, that sucks.
---
On the plus side you don't need the helmet/mask.
---
Fresh
---
No just normal items. The only cursed item I had was the pick axe and I turned it in last week for scrip
---
For some reason a lot of people pretend what amateur modders can do in their free time doesn't count. Bethesda's output is actually pathetic in comparison.
---
Ok, thank you for the offer comrade.
---
What‚Äôs the protocols do again?
---
Thanks for the replies.  
---
Wow, so it still doesn't sound like it's worth going to those regions even after the update LOL.  Other than dailies.
---
It has made events in hose areas more fun, though. Very first quest I did after One Wasteland update was Campfire Tales.  And holy SHIT BALLS.  that final wave hits different when the 8 bloodbugs, ticks, and wolves are all level 75 LOL.
---
Ok Ill have to keep that in mind. Did they change the % in the patch, because I have run ACP dozens of times and never had this much of a problem till this run after the patch?
---
I‚Äôll admit I am guilty of Leroying my way into every situation. But that‚Äôs half the fun
---
Ok. Maybe in the future just don't make incorrect and ignorant statements about things you don't know.
---
Enjoy the game.
---
Nah, seems you have no idea. I have +2000 h on my main pc account, 400 on my second pc account and 180 on my ps4 account. Console version sucks in all points, stability and performance. Go on playing with 30fps 1080p while i enjoy 144fps on 21:9, texture and qol mods (would quit without perk loadouts anyway). Also console players are aimless without any clue what they are doing. Pc gamers are more focused and passionated. These few hackweapons here and there are mostly funny then annoying, ever saw a orbitslstrike broadsider with inf ammo shooting at an event making everyone blind and deaf? Oh, ofc you haven't... you also don't have confetti guns! üéâ
---
Try to find the cheese gear/build because Bethesda can't create actually interesting encounters so they just make enemies have insane HP and Defense so normal players just waste their time trying. It's a joke.
---

---
If it makes you feel better, I was able to claim 5 spaces on the board yesterday that I had yet to achieve.  I claimed them all and then the map went back to normal.  I guess I'll get to claim those same rewards again.  I got those assholes back for you.
---
That 180/60 thing is a myth.  It doesn‚Äôt work like that for me at all.  There seems to be a 20-24 hour timer on items when I play (examples... weights at prison, silos, and fire department and a couple days or more on lucky hole).  This is consistent for me across 10 characters on 2 accounts.  Each one has an individual timer.  I do have to server hop to a public world between characters to to get a new reset of a private server, but once I hit a silo, no amount of looting or containers resets it before the next day.  For me at least
---
Must have for bloodied pa users, quicker speed and I think its 50 percent damage reduction if under 20 percent health
---
OOOO I just did what I said and it's NOT breaking as fast this is so good! You are a good man thanks.
---
Are you sure he wasn't just afk?
---
The secret service seems to come in pre-fix batches , but the batches are not static.   If you really want a specific prefix, craft 4-5 items.  If you do not get that pre-fix at all, stop, and try again later, or server hop.  Get a 1* of the right pre-fix, but you want a 3*? Keep rolling.  With this method I got my preferred pre-fix on all 5 pieces in about 60 tries.  Someone explained the RNG a few weeks ago.  I'll see if I can share that post.
---
what is ads? second time ive seen this acronym.
---
Yeah, it does sound that you are not ready yet, but level 70 with right perks and gear(or just mediocre) should not be destroyed by liberators. Maybe with few changes to your build you should be ready to take back the wasteland from those awful creatures. One Appalachia is not so hard lvl50+ players. The problem is when you are lover than that.
---
If your on ps4 I have a bloodied minigun
---
Whatever you say kid. I'll continue enjoying my nearly bugless experience. Go eat a whole raw potato ü•î 
---
Good day sir.
---
Well you'd think I would've jumped on that but my dumbass just assumed everyone would still be selling .45 ammo üòÖ I can only rank it up twice now but it'll still be worth the end result
---
Or clueless people build camps there like the one place on the trainstation where the responderbot can spawn with rare stuff. It prevents it.
---
As far i know nothing related to durability was changed, keep in mind that enemys may have higher levels which means more resistance which decreases more durability.
---
Guns are often 3-12 pounds though, making them weigh something like 50 or 100x as much per cap as glowing meat.  I have almost 600 carry weight, but most people are around 200 and couldn't carry 1400 caps worth of guns on them like they could meat steak.
---
Yeah, I've seen this complaint MULTIBLE times.
---
But bruh just get these three star legendary armor pieces and guns it's super easy! /s
---
Pepperoni roll 4 life
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
it's not hard to get, just boring if you have to do it every single day just to keep your guns firing. Doesn't take much to make more events drop repair kits. I think it's a pretty fair request from every non FO1 users.
---
Yeah still come across it in vendors but nowhere near as much as before..
---
One time I joined a casual team. The team leader changed it to a Daily Op group, but I don't know how long it was before I noticed.
---
You know, my pc is heating up enough to cook the potato. I could even grill it if I put it on my radiator...
---
I will appreciate. Thanks buddy

This.  If I wanted to break in, a door lock wouldn't even slow me down.

[Where to Farm All the Things!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) This is a great spreadsheet and should help you out! You'll make it! We've all been there lol
---
Yea I just thought about that ...now that Earl is lvl 100...were he was what...95 before...makes sense now that I‚Äôm thinking about it...oh well...no lose i guess since I have all his loot except the gas mask...shame about the easy 24 treasury notes tho...lol
---
Ok so, level 49. That still leaves 39 levels of getting weaker, and the entire 50+ gear farm where the same mobs get deadlier and deadlier.
---
‚ÄúEnd Game‚Äù should definitely be more difficult than starting content for sure, but a rat you oneshot at level one shouldn‚Äôt gradually become more and more deadly as you level. Evidence of your increase in power as you level feels good, and keeping low level mobs around is how you get that. 
---
I think you‚Äôre missing my point, but that‚Äôs fine. I hope I articulated it a little better.
---
Bosses should all drop repair kits I agree, but I think you're being unreasonable. It doesn't take a whole lot to grind mats for a day or two. It doesn't even take a whole lot of time to grind mats for a day.

Maybe you are just done friend. Maybe you've seen it all and it's time to retire. It's ok, it happens.

As a tank I'd love this.
---
The exploit was that you could stack +2 S every time you got off the machine and back on. Roll around woth +60 S for a nice couple min is the exploit. I'm highly sure they wanted to only give you +2 only for 30 min.
---
You're the GOAT lol
---
I'm not sure this is true. Because you can pull up your pipboy while still inside the dungeon after everything is dead. You can even check your Notes tab to see if you had any plans drop. And you can do all of this before you even check the end mission screen.
---
As far as I can tell, the rewards (if any) get added to your inventory the instant the end boss dies. Not when you leave, or check the results, or whatever.
---
The power armor is what he used to get into your base.
---
There is also the camo skin in pass this season (mid 70s I believe)
---
Sorry I cant help you.
---
No, it's not
---
Thank you SO much! I'm playing on PS4. I'm in AEST zone and usually play at night. Just tried the scorched Earth event down in Cranberry Bog and got so save someone for the first time. 
---
Nukes &amp; Dragons looks great, thanks for the link. That will help with Skyrim too.
---
You're right about Wiki, I refer to it often, but there seem to be a lot of unwritten rules about teams that you almost have to learn the hard way unless you know other players.
---
Same here. Must be based on the same percent formula as VATS.
---
I‚Äôll come back to it in a few days and have a play around with my perks and organise my load out and see if I get on a bit better, I may have had a knee jerk reaction, but I don‚Äôt necessarily want to play a game for the difficulty, I like to play to enjoy the world and story.
---
Yes, the update is really good. Can't say it feels significantly more challenging than before, but I really enjoy that I can revisit the forest without feeling like I'm not getting anything out of it.
---
Looks like we're gonna have to redo these achievements MULTIBLE times. Maybe I'll get a confetti gun ü§£
---
Take a 45 with a fully modded 45 kit, and a 10 with a fully modded 10 kit, and the 10 will out damage, and take less damage by about half. 
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
It just downloads for everyone
---
If you're on PC let me know.   
---
I can kit you out with a little bit of gear/guns. :)
---
We should be able to plant everything.
---
You only pay for the base game all gameplay dlc is free
---
power off your vendors
---
I slap mine on when he's at like 10 percent health now.  Had one time where a surprise ceiling cave in got me right as he died, and another time got mobbed by several spawns while entering my power armor right after he had died. Now I put it on before he actually does just so I don't accidentally get booted outside with no protection again.
---
Also, avoid jumping back down right as he is about to die because the rocks will spawn around you as you are falling down the shaft and it makes you go splat.
---
I would do LHM, collect even more stuff, maybe 300, then jump servers
---
I spent the better part of 400 to get a halfway decent complete set.  It took over 200 to even get a 1\* left leg.  Good luck bro, you may need it.
---
I prefer Morgantown. Especially on a low server, I'll hit it, farm the ghouls, then find the lowbies and drop a hazmat suit
---
So my character, which is built melee because it was the best option in all the previous Fallouts, but which just uses weight perks and shotguns and heavy guns and no melee, will finally get to melee something?  \*tears\*
---
Now the 2+ year long wait to get a bloodied glaive to drop for me...
---
I recommend Slug Buster, ESPECIALLY now that Tank Killer works with pistols. I also recommend, as mentioned earlier, the Crack Shot perk for extra range, and throwing the pulse capacitor on for a less flamer-y flamer (and bonus against the BoS, when they arrive.)
---
Also, it's free.
---
What???? You serious? What do you add it too? The arms or torso? Because I also want the stealth boy and calibrated shocks. I‚Äôm a bloodied sneak commando
---
I‚Äôve tested for 2 days, using equal level weapons to character, and equal level mods. THe level 5-10 characters do significantly more damage, and take significantly less.
---
Sorry to hear that.  Do you play on a team?  Honestly with the one wasteland update its easier to play on a team and make high level friends. If you were on ps4 id make your 2k rounds of what you need.  
---
It takes a while to learn the best way to play this game. 
---
If you wanna keep playing just try and get as much knowledge as you can.  If you are having trouble with ammo, watch a video on ammo farming.
---
 Do you have excavator power armor?  if so one run through luck hole mine can yield you over 1000 lead.  Uranium fever event can yield 800 steel with scrapper. Line in the sand is the same.  Acid farming too.
---
.
---
What do you mean new profile? If you do t own Fallout 76 on that profile you have to buy it, but if you don own it you ha e Wastelanders, Wastelanders is a content update not a DLC so everyone who owns Fallout 76 has the Wastelanders content update
---
I am seeing the same thing.  I used to have a water farm, but decided to move my CAMP into the mountains and have been earning a good living via Glowing Meat Steak.  But, they really nerfed glowing meat drops into the dirt.  Even with Butcher's Bounty 3 equipped, literally only got 2 pieces of glowing meat all day yesterday.  WTF?!
---
I have a bloodied mini with 40 bash and 90RW
---
I got the cryo mod because, well, it's the best...  UNTIL I HEARD THIS!
---
Why would you try to kill a boss with only one other person?
---
Agreed. I'm only level 45 but I hate spending literally all of my ammo on one legendary monster. They have such higher health % than us, it's just not fun. Bullet sponges. I'm not grinding mats just to kill this one mob.
---
I would, but it bugged at the very end right as I hit 7 minutes &gt;:(
---
Hopefully when people start making it in bulk like you did they'll put it in their vendors but I'm betting I'm going to have to start crafting most my ammo now
---
Most of the time, existing Daily Op teams having already completed Elder for themselves and are stilled teamed because its easier to stay teamed than the leave the team.
---
If you start an Op, they'll come along for the ride.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre absolutely right, and end game _should_ be more difficult, and time and effort overcome that difficulty. But during that leveling journey you feel like you‚Äôre getting weaker, not stronger the whole time. This makes the game feel significantly worse than when you can roflstop threw low level areas.
---
Once you unlock all other trophies you get plat and that's it.
---
It's under lights, and in my case was the second option over from the red metal fireplace.
---
Ouch, that sucks bro.
---
If you own fallout 76, then you own wastelanders. All expansions, patches, updates, etc are included. If you made a new bethesda account, you may need to buy fallout 76 on that account. Just having the game installed is not enough you need to log in with an account that purchased it.
---
Pretty sure I never was robbed. I‚Äôve had the score glitch happen couple times. But pretty positive I never got robbed

Will the event be coming back later in the night?

No hot all the trophies
---
I‚Äôm full health shotgun build
---
Just put accelerated barrel on it and yeah
---
Thank you, lol
---
Maybe. I‚Äôm level 300 and can craft ridiculous amounts of ammo really easily. And still have a stack of mats to ply with. If u loot the bodies at daily Ops and Earle the wendigos you get a significant amount of ammo from them.
---
Mutations already do this, just buy the serums for like 300 caps
---
Yeah, if you need all the pieces to be one specific roll in all 3 stars, it would be a huge grind.
---
I've been screaming about this since the Legendary Run started. You have some AMAZING builders in this community! You could pick FIVE of them, hand them all the items and they will tell you IN NANOSECONDS what's wrong with them.
---
lol, looks like some gravity hammer ass thing from halo.
---
Oh yea...was finally making good time too..at that point i"m like "fk it..."
---
makes sense
---
Do you think with an influx of ammo you'd stick with it for a while longer?
---
 I think as you carry on and refine your perks and playstyle you could get into it.  It's quite rewarding once you get going, with the teams mechanic and the recent One Wasteland update I think it's better than ever.
---
Have a think, I'm happy to craft you a load of ammo if you fancy it.
---
Ohh ok thanks lol i was scrapping them like an idiot üòÇ
---
Liquid courage is a wonderful drink. It's a fairly common OPs drop but takes Earl's nut sac to craft one.
---
That's generally even less reliable.
---
Mmm.  I have a vamp plas, a bloodied plas, and a bloodied explosive plas.  VE is next on my list.
---
True that. My weapons used to last a couple of days at least and now i¬¥m repairing them even during events!!! And i always have Gunsmith lvl 5 equipped!
---
This is really not fair, it was bad enough the damage got nerfed but now i got to fix weapons even during events!? C¬¥mon Bethesda, play fair.
---
You had good RNG that day, there were zero legendaries when I went through.  Although, I did get to meet Bloody Pecker.
---
So, because I recognize that there was **never** a statement about *how many* free Atoms or *how frequently* we could earn them, and therefore an adjustment that still falls within their promise doesn‚Äôt break the promise... that makes me a ‚Äòbootlicker‚Äô?
---
Nah. It simply means I keep an unbiased opinion about the situation and look at it logically instead of reacting emotionally. 
---
I‚Äôd be glad to see more free Atoms. Hell, I‚Äôve even proposed that the Seasons give us points to spend as we see fit, so those that want more perk card packs can get those, or those that don‚Äôt want/need scrap/repair kits can avoid those in favor of gold bullion, for example. And so on. And those that don‚Äôt want scrip or gold or card packs or kits could instead get Atoms. 
---
The idea of entitlement that a player is supposed to get X for free is ludicrous. 
---
Are there still free Atoms available for playing the game?  Yes. End of story.
---
And get a piece of armor that has 15% blocking damage to make it magic
---
Interesting that you have found this with so many characters. I have personally done a lead run of weights across about 8 points of interest, snatched all the books from summersville and done a west tek/emmett/array for XP run and then back to the first weight area and been able to loot again. While it is more "free"(aka no acid) lead, it takes too long where as one LHM run is profitable in less than 10 min.
---
The other fallouts literally had no survival mechanics in them.
---
Had that happen a couple of times but the script is to good to pass up so I end up running it for a few hours back to back.
---
Because wben shooting a bullet, the thing the bullet hits is definitely what degrades the receiver and barrel of the gun.
---
Very nice!! I love the gat plas. I traded a Junkie‚Äôs FFR reduced weight Fixer for it. Next on my list is trying out that Gauss Minigun
---
I've had really really good experiences with a flamer for this, get swarmed? Area damage, close the gap on ranged and delete them in half a second, and with resilient you vaporize then Bash. GG EZ lol
---
Again, just a matter of personal preference and perception. To me, grinding for materials is the most boring part of the game. I'm just asking that the new game mechanics don't alter my general feeling with the game. I don't think that's being unreasonable.
---
I would recommend picking up the blocker skill, which is in strength, and/or serendipity, which is in luck. It will give you a little wiggle room!
---
I have thought about summersville books, crazy cat lady house, maybe corn at the farm and that should reset item list maybe?
---
Agree.
---
The ammo though.  I made 2650 plasma cores the other day, so I think I'm sticking with plasmas.
---

---
Try gatling gun instead of minigun. Same ammo. Same big magazine. Better damage for more controllable rate of fire.
---
I think you mean may they forever be plagued by the runs, the constant need to sneeze, and be lost to the chaos of bumper-to-bumper traffic.
---
there's a timer in the corner
---
&gt; Once. I commented once.
---
Sorry - that comment wasn't specifically directed at *you* saying it. It's more that **every single time** the VATS issue is brought up someone always comes in with "well, XCOM/statistical probability/user bias blah blah blah". Every time. And it's not any of that - there is a friggin' bug with VATS. Even the devs have commented on it, but they don't seem to understand how to fix it.
---
&gt; But, I very frequently, across many games, encounter people who think 95% means "you shouldn't ever miss"
---
Yes, math is math. Believe me - I'm playing Mordheim CotD right now, and I'm painfully aware of exactly how often an 80%+ chance to hit something misses. 
---
This isn't that. This is a bug that is just consistent enough to be verifiable, while not being absolutely consistent enough to trace the cause.
---
Yes. You can shoot 1million bullets into air or the floor, the weapons durability won't change at all.
---
Also twoshot has double the durability decrease then other weapons, tho it only deals 25% more damage for the second projectile.
---
It should.  To be honest I just don't need that much lead.  Once a day would be more than enough.  That's like 1000 lead
---
Firstly sneak everywhere. plan you engagement. Do not take on a whole group at once. Start with long range stealth to pick some off. Switch to close quarters fast fire weapons when pressed. Med x is your new best friend. And when all else fails have an escape plans. (Cripples, cryos, ect.)
---
They weren't in Fallout 4 either, but the Snallygaster is actually pretty similar to the concepts for what the Fallout 4 Centaur would have looked like.  Just with a single head instead of several.
---
Compare the [concept](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d1/Fo4_centaur_concept_art.png/revision/latest?cb=20160105003431) to the [Snallygaster](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/7d/Fallout76_Tales_Snallygaster.png/revision/latest?cb=20181109213224).
---
Maybe it's a bit of this:

You‚Äôll be good for months!
---
We already have ammo currency - the converter. Not unrealistic for a good event to put in some set amount of ammo converter currency - no weight, don‚Äôt have to use it if you don‚Äôt want. But if you do, just load it up and burn through as much as you want. 
---
Can gift the ammo to a bud or a lowbie if needed. 
---
Improve the converter interface (like the dude that posted the one that looks like a vendor) and you‚Äôre good to go
---
Yes but getting materials is a huge part of this game. If you dont like it then buy them from other people.
---
Sadly not everyone carries one around so we would have to wait a couple of days before such is shown. So it may be easier just to provide all affecting factors.
---
Hey , it‚Äôs gets easier. A bit of luck with a drop or in a vendor and (after level 50) can give you a weapon that fits your playstyle and you can spec your build around it , then the more you run gun and kill the more loot for scrapping or selling, ( the mole miners and then an overburdened waddle down to whitesprings station to sell all their weapons) sure you still need ammo but it gets easier when you‚Äôve got an easy way to make caps and can just buy them from another player. If your on Xbox my gamer tags Gustavo2695 send me a message and if we‚Äôre both on sometime I‚Äôd be happy to help out with some stuff if you need it üëç
---
Why you asking that? I‚Äôm curious because I have all the cursed weapons on me being they weigh nothing and I save them for scrip
---
Is the daily ops ammo at the end screen separate to what you picked up off the corpses or just the total you collected from dead enemies on that run?
---
"Shoot'm in the head, Shoot'm in the head, Kill, Now reload and do it again"-military cadence
---
I havent seen them come thru yet, been waiting patiently haha
---
Me.  I murder everyone else who'll die.
---
Whitespring station is only a 2 minute walk fully overencumbered from the mine. Usually hoarding a ton of weapons for caps isn't such a good idea, but there is no other gun heavy event or farming area that is closer to a robo vendor than this one.
---
I mean I do have a full set of Unyielding WWR that helps a bit when I need to hold weapons for the vendor reset.
---
Well just because it is there doesn't mean someone has to select it. That's why even FONV had the option of No Trait. If a person feels they can work around the disadvantage because the advantage of that Trait is worth it, let them try. 
---
If certain Traits are too tricky to let a potentially brand new person to the game try them out from level 5, then limit them to only being available from level 50 or 100 onwards, after people will have gotten a bit more experience in the game to understand the effect of their choice. 
---
An example might be "Rad Conversion: You can inflict additional energy damage equal to 50% of the rads you have been irradiated by, but you can no longer reduce your rads with Aid or Perks", a level 5 might not understand the effect of this, but a level 100 will understand that although they get a big damage boost, basically they will die to rads at some point if they aren't careful, even if they are in PA.
---
I still get so much glowing meat and its annoying since I ditched my food-based perks for the cannibal perk, so it ways so much.
---
Do events. Things like lead of the pack, will give you four legendaries at your level. As a high level player, I‚Äôve actually seen my damage go up in this patch. The real problem is there is no way I can possible help someone who isn‚Äôt at least level 50. All my guns and armor are at that level, I can‚Äôt even drop anything you‚Äôd use
---
Grab some power armor as soon as you can use it.  Pre 50 power armor is the way to go.  At least for me it was.
---
True, but the great thing about Uranium fever is that it is a short and easy waddle down the hill to the vendor.
---
I'm hoping like 3 months, yeah.
---
Don't spread lies. Post your proof of this claim or gtfo.
---
Those are the real myth
---
it is but it shouldn't become a bigger part than it already is. To me and to many other at least.
---
FO76 now has an educational moments expansion pack. Through experience in-game and forum discussions players now have a chance to receive life lessons. All drops are flagged as extremely rare.
---
I wasn‚Äôt posting where to farm lead... I was posting **how** to farm lead.
---
Nah dude, I run up a set of stairs, the callout of "here comes the leader" plays and the door in front of me opens, revealing essentially my build for Ada, terrifying tanky twin minigun hellbitch. 
---
At last a worthy opponent!
---
Pretty sure the rewards are given immediately upon completion. Spent time tooling for ammo and checked my pip boy before checking the ops results. Had a new legendary and a new plan. Checked my results and there listed where the same legendary and plan.
---
Do you need the armor to make it magic? I‚Äôve been wondering being I have a few good magic minis and sometimes they shred and sometimes they don‚Äôt. But I never have the armor piece on. Is that needed?
---
One of my first runs through I grinded hard to get to the end. Was sorting my inv and I hear " nuclear launch detected". Close the pip boy and there's 2 dudes jumping around me and emoting. It was  one of those " I'm so tired that I'm not even tired" moments but with anger lol. Then they practically one shot the scorchbeast after. That was the day I said fuck it I'll play this game the "right" way and started stacking mutations.
---
I got a camp build idea once I get the greenhouse set. I'm building a bar with the greenhouse windows on the front, pool table, foosball tables, a bar, my dart board, etc.
---
The fact that the legendary perks still are active while the broken piece is equipped means it‚Äôs intentional. It‚Äôs not a work around it‚Äôs expected.
---
Probably because they copy/pasted their "OP build" through a YouTube video and don't really understand that what works in PvE doesn't necessarily work in PvP.
---
[edit: apparently comment 1 isn‚Äôt true anymore! Sorry bud]
---
2- Complete easy events with other players to gain more xp than from enemies (Path to Enlightenment, Feed the People are pretty easy if you‚Äôre not alone in the event). 
---
3- If you can, get a scoped rifle/gun to spot enemies before they see you. You can decide if they‚Äôre too tough for you and stay away. 
---
Also, stick to the forest!
---
Hope that‚Äôll help you.
---
If your on Xbox I‚Äôll hook you up with ammunition I can make a ton and the best under armor for your level I can make a lot of everything this game is hard for new comers My gamer tag is jemayo 420 I‚Äôll be on in like 15 minutes if you can‚Äôt meet today hit me up I‚Äôm on once a day
---
Sorry they both take the chest option unfortunately so its either stealthboy or protocols but I think protocols is best. Technically you should have to choose jepack or protocols too but camo glitch ;)
---
Anyone with an end game character that loves to grind has this problem.
---
No it doesn't.  What Rads is a great Perk.  I am invulnerable to radiation at Lvl 4 in PA.  I can remain in a Blast Zone indefinitely with no rad damage.  Also, Rad Worms does nothing to me when I have it.  Going to try no PA in Blast Zone and see what happens.
---
Sounds like Serendipity kicked in for him.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs a valid point. They CERTAINLY have some balancing to do. And it doesn‚Äôt feel like any other fallout game where you can use whatever build you desire and make it viable, which does suck.
---
Yeah man.  Was getting mundane.  I‚Äôm lvl 275
---
It takes literally no effort for me to have roadway, water, and meat, so...
---
Okay damn everyone who commented on here was so nice! They are giving some great insight!
---
This is false. You get the rewards after you kill the boss.
---
I was building around this and now I also started thinking, if you play in a group, if one guy has surpessor, one has tenderizer and one has follow through. What happens?
---
Quantum lamps was out a month ago or more. It was in the discount area for fallout 1st. They‚Äôve just recently started that. But lately it‚Äôs been everything I‚Äôve already have. I messed up and didn‚Äôt grab the lamp I wanted it being it‚Äôs actually big unlike the stupid small ones I have that barely work
---
pfft, that guy's not so tough, and frankly he's a bit of a doofus. I outwitted him easily: https://imgur.com/gNBM1pM
---
I switch Ammo Factory in and out when I make ammo.
---
Uses vats with shotguns only. I dont know why but vats shots are doing considerably more damage
---
Me and my buddies were discussing this, I‚Äôm level 60 on PS4 and I‚Äôm burning through soo much ammo it‚Äôs  beyond ridiculous and I have a solid heavy guns build.
---
One idea we‚Äôve tried out and seems to work effectively is we‚Äôre having to travel together in teams when on a resource run or just about anything in particular. Playing solo is tricky and I feel I may have to switch my playing style to accommodate the game. Which is fine I like the challenge but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me who thinks this way
---
Technically it's two modifiers.  Two shot and explosive are two different effects
---
Ammo Currency was floated as an idea before the Ammo Converter came out.  What I was hoping for was a Scrip-type currency that could have been used at the train station ammo machines, same with Medical Currency.  The machines were already in game, there was a trade system already programmed, and it would have let the players choose the ammo they wanted, as opposed to random ammo awards, or the ever-so-clunky Ammo Converter
---
They should just call them Fart grenades.
---
 On a more serious note, yes they are just as useless as the rest of grenades in this game. In which we can drop with out being prompt, are you sure you want to drop this garbage, scrap is more beneficial than these grenades at this point. 
---
In my  opinion It all gets down to ballance changes that this game so desperately needs, even the level ‚öñ just introduced, just is not balanced properly, the thing I loved before was thing where  more realistic, I keep leveling up my knowledge to become that better hunter, yes the XP on kills are great, but whats the point of becoming a better experienced warriors when everything scales up to your level. Yes the challenge is great but it takes away from how realistic this game feels incompatibility to a real world scenarios in which it was more comparable to in the beginning, than now in my opinion.
---
 And that is what I truly loved about this game, imaging how believable this game was in comparison to reality. That is what keeps people going, the close comparison to reality and fiction. This game has gone from close to futuristic reality to pure of the tracks fantasy. Way too much has been added in the wrong ways, instead of building on this games loar, more realistic stories and strategies apposed to just turning it into fantasy grind game. With out any disrespect to anyone, this what I see from 76 in my own eyes. What I loved ‚ù§ about this game back in the beginning. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best!üôÇ
---
Make Appalachia great again! ‚ù§
---
I am on Xbox I can craft you ammo to help you out
---
Insert one 25 round magazine, rotate your selector to semi and watch your lanes. Free fire in 3 round bursts. OPEN fire.
---
better crits, savvy for 33 luck builds, clover has very low chance to proc
---
Oh I know. Classic Bethesda
---
Fully spawned for you not them - Spawn lag. The player can move before the camp loads in. If they move to your vendor room the room will spawn around them and they can access the machines. Move your vendors away from the spawn point or store them away.
---
in this game there are often bugs with sound and this is ok dude x)
---
It's better safe than sorry and with fallout 76 you can never be too careful when it comes to exploits/bugs.
---
I thought it was a problem with my laptop and it might be but my sound has been cutting out whilst playing and then I need to restart the game in order for it to come back
---
I go to lucky hole about once every month lately. I still have 3700 lead. I have ammosmith and super duper maxed and I maxed out the ammo legendary perk. So I use less resources and make a ton of ammo
---
They have a chance of giving Treasury Notes
---
Im just now experiencing this one though i was scared that it might be my headphones üòÇ
---
If the weapon isn‚Äôt instigating,stalkers,or junkies with the right things like bash or 50% limb damage or +33 vats hit
---
Vampire low health heavy gunner is where it's at.  Treat it like it's a bloodied build, but use a vampire's weapon instead.  I think my bloodied plasma does about 50% more than my vampire's, but you get more dps out of the vampire's.  I stood right next to sbq pointing my gun right at her face and didn't take any damage from anything.
---
Im on xbox so idk. I thought it could of been my headphones and i got nervous lol.
---
Full set of Troubleshooters Armor, Troubleshooters .50 Cal and/or prime AA LMG and don't stop except at objectives.  I soloed it first try  in 10:16.  Charge the Big Boss at the end and Psychobuff up for him or you lose a lot of time just dealing with him.  If you are having trouble surviving use a fast firing Vampire weapon.
---
Don't forget dodgy, but that's exactly what I use.
---
Nope, wrong.
---
The second the boss dies, the loot gets added to your inventory.
---
It's not guaranteed that you'll get a rare plan, even at Elder Rank. Completing Elder on your first try and having all 3 reward tiers roll still only gives you a ~83% chance of getting a rare plan.
---
All the summary screen does is give you a summary. It doesn't provide the rewards.
---
You get a similar option with 8 Charisma.
---
I noticed they are kind of effective against the Colossus Wendigo...but nothing else.
---
Is the discount area of the Atomic Shop available to all Fo1st members or is it only for the annual subscription?
---
That could be it!
---
If you store the machine, you don‚Äôt have to relist. Place the machine back out and everything is already loaded and priced. At least that‚Äôs how it went for me last time I did it.
---
Those commie bots are rubbing off on them. What's mine is yours, COMRADE.
---
Yup.  I play everyday after work.  I regularly log back in and jump on a character and go straight to silo on my private sever and it is dead empty.  Maybe bethesda just hates me, but my I loot EVERYTHING everywhere.  I loot thousands of things and never get resets except what seems to be time based on my account.
---
I understand what you are saying, and I still agree.
---
But please, don't forget: bethesda only released fallout new Vegas, they didn't developed it directly. Since bethesda fully owns the franchise they kicked it with boots and forced it to generate money without any passion what fallout is supposed to be. They made their first fallout game for casuals and screwed the lore and balance. Deathclaws are no longer harmfull, power armors are common and the wasteland isn't dangerous anymore. 
---
What I want to say is, bethesda's team for fallout 76 isn't a good, organised or trained team of developers anymore. For now it looks like only a handful advanced devs working with a bunch of trainees experimenting around with basic stuff they then sell half finished. Every change on balance or rebalance must be well tuned and engineered. One wastelanders took more then 4 months of optimisation without the developing itself and still got some significant last minute adjustments we didnt had on pts. The chance they mess up such a change would be huge. 
---
I really love to see some negative influences when choosing buffs, as of right now it would only cause a huge bugfest.
---
I think it's a seperate reward, because I was wielding my handmade while I ran 3-4 daily ops and suddenly I became over encumbranced. I looked to my inventory and I had over 1000x5.56 ammos and I started with about 400.
---
"High risk"
---
Waaaaat a gun that shoots Baits, that‚Äôs crazy
---
That's a good idea thanks
---
&gt;Also, durability is affected by resistance of enemys. Your gun breaks faster when used on tought enemys.
---
I've never heard this claim before.  As far as I know, the decay of durability is based purely on the raw number of hits to the enemy, and can be modified by events (i.e. Spec Ops has less durability reduction than other events).
---
Truth is, when you fight Earle or the SBQ, most players lay down far more bullets than they realize, and especially compared to normal wasteland traversal.
---
I dont. I recommend a jetpack from the gold bullion grind, so you can back off with ease and do what your build does best - stay at range and not take melee or close range damage.
---
Its not worth doing unless you or your team mates got good gear. Usually even if there's 7 people with shit gear its possible but not two to three with shit gear.
---
Thank you all for the feedback, its going in the scrap bin.
---
Oh I've got a few plasma pistols to toy with. Thanks for your advice. I'll definitely be using Tank Killer - I'm modifying my commando to be able to swap some perks around and become a geurilla. Since I've already got 15 in Perception, I'm pretty much looking for things to fill it up.
---
edit: and Crack Shot. Thanks for that.
---
&gt;Within a few weeks a lot more people are going to have it and its value will drop.
---
I'm starting to have doubts about that.  The op isn't even a week old and I am already getting duplicate copies of the least desirable plans. And that's from getting the  Elder Rank.
---
The RNG in this game is broken and it's one of this game's biggest problems. It's   theoretically possible for someone to get the BOS outfit on the first try and for someone who runs it literally hundreds of times for a year to never get it.
---
Just like with Radiation Rumble you can fill the ore to 100 percent and keep all the workers alive and end up with the exact same rewards  you get from having done the bare minimum.
---
It's the sort of thing that leads to entire game elements getting shut down. Eventually people just decide why bother and they stop running it.
---
Why is it so hard to just use a fusion generator?
---
I thought Plasma Explosives where legacy weapons. That's awesome. Congrats.
---
Because of the way armor penetration works, and the effectiveness of incisor, junkies is still really good on high damage melee weapons compared to anti-armor.
---
wasteland whisperer is not used to tame anything , just animal friend
---
My Quad Auto ffr Tesla continues to annihilate anything but SBQ and Earle.  Love to fry crowds with it.  I have found that any other Tesla does not have the ammo capacity to deal with crowds or Legendary enemies.
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not having issues but it‚Äôs certainly not fixed for me. Had it at colloidal problem and scorched earth just yesterday
---
I'm not on, but I thought there were only 5 slots...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Been having this happen with my Tesla, it keeps reloading with about 10 bullets left in it. It‚Äôs soo annoying that I don‚Äôt even use the Tesla anymore just for this reason.
---
This is why we need photos as camp display items.
---
bloodied - protocols 
---
any other build - med pump
---
You can glitch past all the obstacles though.
---
Yeah I had to stop playing because of this yesterday. I was just trying to talk to a friend but things kept getting way to intense
---
Craft a lvl 1 gun. Go shoot as many common enemys till it breaks, count the bullets. Then repair it without perks, go to the queen and repeat it.
---
Idk how hard the impact is right now with one wastelanders, but as I farmed cloth at morgantown Airport event killing lvl 5 scorched my gun's durability didnt moved a pixel after hundreds of enemys. The same gun broke apart after a few mags into the queen.
---
Edit: the dragon breaks after about 4 shots on the queen, 12 on her spawns.
---
Also pre one wastelander testing.
---
Yeah, it's not gone.
---
&gt; but they don't seem to understand how to fix it.
---
Comments elsewhere in this thread seem to imply that at least some of the time, it's a matter of a hit being turned into a "miss" by striking an intervening body part.
---
Yeah I have full health thanks
---
Absolutely. I‚Äôm a rifle build and I‚Äôm burning through the ammo fighting ticks and rats?
---
So now my grind has turned into lead and steel grinding, instead of XP and Score grinding.
---
It should have opened for you at level 300. May need a bit more info here. Is it showing as locked, is it not showing at all? Are you unable to equip? :) More info might help get you a faster answer!
---
Thank u! They definitely are legacies, which was why I was sooo gutted when i realized I dropped it.
---
-close
---
And gauss weapon bugs still remain as well, including the 100% miss on first vats hit.
---
I run a full set of Troubleshooters in the silo. I can stand in front of an Assaultron and take the full face laser blast and lose only about 25% of my health bar so thought each piece stacked.  I am running Fireproof Lvl 3, does that effect the laser damage?
---
I‚Äôve been hesitant to assign my legendary perks because I wanted to wait for community feedback but I just went ahead and maxed out ammo factory and 1* fallow through.
---
I have one slot left.  Any suggestions?  I‚Äôm a bloodied rifleman build.
---
My only thought is that if they do this, let us level up our gear as we play with it.
---
Nobody hardly does events anymore. They are just to expensive resource wise.
---
Call it what it is:  a bug.  Once a mob detects one person it detects everyone.  You can then no longer get damage bonuses, eliminating an entire style of damage.
---
Here is another tip, I got my alternate character to level 50 by farming the crap out of the radiation rumble event.  I had a level 45 character, no buffs, chems, etc, INT of 11 points, and I made it to 50 in four events.  I started with a level 35 tse 50 cal, then had to switch to a level 25 cursed pickaxe.  I am not a bloodied build, but I still managed to decimate everything there with just that.  The turrets were almost too good with killing enemies, but as long as I tagged everything I still got 140-150 exp per kill.  Again, this was with no buffs and forgetting to sleep for additional exp gain.
---
Nothing, just keep shooting them.
---
imo most gaming communities or at least sub-Reddit are like that. 
---
Over in any COD sub-reddit they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúIf map voting isn‚Äôt back I‚Äôm canceling my pre-order‚Äù they put in map voting ‚ÄúThis map voting sucks it‚Äôs just the same map over and over‚Äù 
---
or how fast a lot of people turn. It can go from ‚ÄúThis will be the greatest CoD since BO2 and if you don‚Äôt like it your a noob who sucks and 3arc (developer) can do is no wrong.‚Äù To playing the Alpha build and saying ‚ÄúThis game F*ing sucks and if they don‚Äôt fix it to my specific wants I‚Äôm canceling since it caters to the casual crowd‚Äù
---
I was trying to figure out why it wasn't letting me use it
---
Depends upon weapon choice if if has vats crits fill 15percent quicker, I wouldnt run four leaf clover. Hard to answer when you could be running a broadsider.. ammo capacity and weapon perks could sway my opinion however better crits would be my choice.
---
Action Boy refills your AP's 45% faster at Lvl 3.
---
West Tek still the xp grind spot, chaining ops is best leg grind, with decent xp depending on the monsters and mods.
---
Bird bones is worth it just for the agility.  It also makes the landing animation in power armor only trigger from higher up, which is why I like it, because I hate kneeling down for forever when I fall.
---
pepperoni rolls are why I constantly run out of pepper
---
But... The fusion  core aren't at 100% so Isn't very good...
---
Have you tried the auto grenade launcher yet? It makes explosives fun.
---
Following. I'd do it for you or anyone else for free if I had it, but I don't yet
---
You ever go to a large parking lot and explode all the old cars? So much explosions!
---
Running an Instigating, Explosive, 15% crit fill Lever action
---
Nooooo
---
I have six "magic shotguns".  "Best" depends on type of enemy.  Tough, high damage output enemy requires a Vampire's Combat Shotgun.  It seems to me that Dbl Barrels have the highest per shot damage output though.  So, my Vampires Dbl Barrel is used against the toughest and switch to Vampires Combat if health gets low.
---
it's your nuke bro, put it where ever you want.
---
WTF!?  
---
Proof/explanation?
---
Ah cool, did know about that one, thx!
---
Hilarious explosion that fails to kill anything!
---
They could add a small Mothman cult group that worships the wise Mothman.
---
 The leader could have dialogue explaining the reason the other cultist have gone mad is because they were nornal people/cultist before, but had an encounter with the angry Mothman(don't remember it's actual name).
---
I was very disappointed when it leaked all the cultists were automatically hostile, and I'm sure many were when they started playing wastelanders. 
---
Bethesda knows Mothman is a big hit. Just look at all the atomic shop stuff.
---
Their existence is speculation/rumours. But on Dailymotion you can clearly see its effects unfortunately...
---
Only a 1 star Dragon can still be obtained, by spending candy at the Monster Mash event.
---
Micro nukes won't be viable for use at all until explosives get a buff. They just don't do enough damage to kill anything, a pipe pistol out damages it!
---
No. She were with you when you produced the inoculation and discovered the secrets of vault 97. Why should she go back?
---
Also, she unlocked the basement. And she said davenport is her assistant.
---
the only reason you can buy TSE handmade for 1000c is for the easy way to dupper, and this is no good things,
---
If you want top weapon, offer top weapon
---
if you want the new op outfist, do the op mision, are easy
---
Drop them, get another 500 just from shooting!
---
It can be finicky.  Like, one strategy is to put them on an isolated foundation and blueprint the whole thing so you can replace them.  But when you move your CAMP, you'll have that blueprint *and* the stored Vending Machines you had before, so it's confusing which one you're supposed to put down to preserve the contents.
---
I don't think I've ever had luck just moving CAMP without doing the blueprint first.
---
Dumbest thing I ever did in this game was sell my Quad, Explosive, 15% fast reload Dbl Barrel.  I swear that thing reloaded so fast (w Speed Demon) that it fired as fast as a LMG!
---
No????????????????
---
That would be a punishment too. I‚Äôd rather just get the ammo for the weapon I have equipped
---
There definitely is a bundle from last year. I think it had two carved pumpkins that project the caving on the ground in front of them as well as the paper decorations in the world (red skull, hanging skeleton, hanging bats, and articulated black cat).
---
Thank you for that! I wasn't sure so I've always just put on both.
---
Menu -&gt;scoreboard will fix it for your play session once you log into a server
---
I agree it needs a fix cause it's annoying AF
---
It's called rubberbanding.  The game has a problem with catching up with weapon damage
---
oh look another poster willfully ignoring the fact that its not bloodied meta god players complaining, but low levels. why do you people not know how to read?
---
Someone posted a workaround about 20 min ago so hopefully that helps for the time being
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iwfveb/score_repeated_fanfare_bug_workaround/
---
I really want Bethesda to give us an indicator of camp budget each item will take and call them flamingo units
---
&gt; Camp was fully spawned 
---
Not for them, most likely.
---
It's pretty simple - if you're near max Caps, and your vending machines are in the world (doesn't matter if they are powered off, behind a locked door, etc), you run the risk of someone putting you at max Caps.  Prioritize doing something to spend those.
---
Remember...short controlled bursts.

---
The type of game you are asking for, won't exactly keep people playing. 
---
People are now seeing the benefits of the build they have been working on for months. 
---
If you are getting destroyed by liberators then you really need to look at your perk cards and see what damage resist ones you can use.
---
Look at getting some secret service armour. That will help if you don't want power armour. 
---
Put some points into endurance.
---
Most of all think about what sort of build you like. Unfortunately you do need to spec into a certain weapon type to succeed now. It sucks but without the damage cards for that weapon you will struggle.
---
Eventually you will be able to pick a few QOL perks with legendary perks if you want, but there will always be a better option.
---
  FWIW, I feel your pain - I paid to equip 2 different cards, used both for less than a day, decided I didn‚Äôt really like either one, unequipped both.
---
With 5 out of 6 slots used, it is unlikely I‚Äôll end up using either.
---
I like yiphix‚Äôs idea - move points from luck to AGI.
---
Completely missed that post! Thank you!
---
I wondered where dodgy has been all my life! ü§£ Only tried it out since I cant sneak in daily ops. Now I've made room for it permanently.
---
Going to give that a try!
---
You mean you don't want to support your local delinquent today?
---
Yeah it's pretty stupid that they don't. Something so simple they can't seem to get right like literally every other online game.
---
It did happen twice on my other character after I posted this, so you're probably onto something. I think it was about to happen again  on that character, but instead the game just did one of those loud buzzing crashes while I was in the middle of A Collossal Problem with the nuke that I launched. 
---
Talk about a collossal problem, amirite! Don't leave me hangin'
---
Shit you have to laugh about this stuff otherwise you'd throw your controller against the walls.
---
Not gonna lie I would‚Äôve kept it if I were him
---
I always drop all.... .44 10mm. Shells. Syringer. Flares. Crossbow bolts. Arrows. 40mm grenades. Missiles. Mini nukes and fusion cells and 5mm ammo. It's more of a chore for me.
---
I had 2 spawn for me recently at the end of the event(having a brain fart and can't remember the name).
---
Too bad only 1*s spawn.
---
Didn't changed at all.
---
After pts testing for two weeks I prepared myself with other weapons, stored my be90 gatling plasma and equipped the b25/90 gauss mini. After two days I rolled back and equipped all my previous weapons. Loadout, playstyle and gameplay is totally identical except I leveled more then the previous 2 months.
---
I have heard her say that but it could be a lie like do we know robots are taking over again ?
---
It's all you can do, really.
---
If it's the same group that targeted InnovSurvivalist, I've sure there are a mountain of reports against them.  They've ruined countless CAMPs with hacked weapons and record it for posterity on their YouTube channel.
---
We have all been there mate, like everyone has said, get a hazmat suit on or Chinese stealth armour.
---
I've had it for as long as I remember and it hasn't happened yet. So so so happy.
---
I‚Äôm starving over here!
---
Oh and plasma cores. I have 185 in my vendor for 35caps each. But noone wants them
---
Holdover bug from FO4 then - hopefully they'll fix it.
---
I have some faith, as 76 did fix the LAR bug from FO4.
---
Maybe a scrip for the ammo or medical vending machines
---
They did take over a long time ago. What would you do without the robot on your wrist? Why do you kill others in nuclear winter? 
---
Humans aren't in charge for a while now... wake up sheep!
---
This pic is creepy cool. Great shot!
---
Must be instant repair when hitting a crowd.
---
Yea, that would be a nice feature. 
---
   I play odd hours too - the current setup means I occasionally ‚Äúlose‚Äù a days worth of (bullion dailys/rewards/caps/scrip) because of timegates.
---
I dont have the chinese stealth suit but I'll get a hazmat. 
---
On the map the nuke zone was barely even on the mine so i thought it would be safe. Even on the map it showed that i died outside the zone.
---
Completely false, I've seen the Responder bot inside of someones house before.

---
As brutal as it sounds, it may be in your interest to invest in a few melee perks and use melee whenever your able to in order to stockpile ammo for harder fights.
---
I was going to do that Sony told me to set up a new account!
---
Exactly my point. Shouldn't get punished because you cant play at all times.
---
Wait did they refine how that event works? When i was doing it on its release, they just rush you and theres nothing you can do about it when you go solo.. and because of one wasteland, youd think itd be harder..
---
I have two with me. One with ballistic resist, one with carryweight.
---
Also with how much strength was nerfed, it really doesn't give melee players op damage to get that much strength!
---
same issue here with ps4, and when i do jump into the OP myself 10/10 times its just me and one other guy, but at least that other guy is staying next to the beacons. i have never seen a full team inside an OP yet.
---
Haha well yeah the issue isn‚Äôt so much the cohesion of the story, but the fact that we aren‚Äôt really playing together. Most of the time we are running around at different points of each quest, because there is no shared progress. So one of us hits lvl 20, and the other 2 guys are at 17 still or whatever, because they got bored of waiting for the team leader to finish his run, and then go back and do it all over. Would be nice to actually have a ‚Äúteam‚Äù, you know? Instead of just 3 separate instances happening simultaneously.
---
I'd have thought about it for several minutes before handing it back.  Reluctantly. And having play tested it of course.
---
Thanks! I know that my complaint can be solved and I really appreciate the helpful comments, and I‚Äôll come back when I‚Äôve got some time and respec, and try again, it‚Äôs just I know it‚Äôs going to be a big time sink just to get back to enjoying the game like I was before.
---
Nonetheless, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be back at some point soon, thanks for the help!
---
Salty much?
---
Hmm, darn. Well, double PlayStation plus for them... back on my PlayStation days online gaming were free...
---
I feel like the system was designed for high level players to go back and help low level players, but it'd be nice for similarly leveled players to play together like that.
---
He told me he didn‚Äôt use heavies (lucky for me). But i get it, it would have been so hard for me
---
The people bad enough to get killed by ticks and complain about it are salty lol. Sorry I can stay alive for longer than five minutes
---
If your on pc ull take some spare off your hands, i just started lol
---
Where is the interior of the headquarters of the Blue Ridge Caravan Co.?
---
Very true. Before the update I always knew death was inevitable. I die a heck of a lot more now but I'm having a blast.
---
That‚Äôs been happing to me but only so far at my camp.
---
thanks for the reminder. i stashed my other alt weapon and blew the dust of my Q5025 railway, waiting in the stash for months. modded it and blew away some mole miners. now lets see what the super mutants say to a railway spike in their face :D
---
I have the recipes but idk if I have enough flux to make all 3. My shit is so unorganized right now lol but I'll hit you up if I can get them and you still haven't found them, 'k?
---
Hahahaha
---
I had the same issue and finally crossed over from riflemen to commando and the difference is absolutely ridiculous, with a few minor tweaks my character is so much stronger.
---
What was the Glowing Meat even doing on Mole Miners?  Was it their snack?  Or are we eating the Mole Miner?  Weren't they human, at some point?  Does that make it cannibalism? ü§£
---
Having it 'fixed' on PTS could be a monkey paw too, more than likely if they'd found it a month ago on PTS they'd just have *cut* the weight bench and we'd have something like 50 scrip in the same spot.
---
Hahaha! That‚Äôs awesome.
---
Really...  hmmmm.  Might have to give that a try.  Thanks.
---
Flux for gold would be awesome!
---
Totally agree with that!
---
This has been active for months, proof was posted then!
---
You don't have to listen past the first line. Just back out and the quest will start.
---
World of Warcraft went through something similar so if a stats shake up can mess up that game and the experience of those devs I'm not surprised it happened to 76. Hopefully now they will get plenty of data to fine tune the changes.
---
I think people use Imgur and add a link here.
---
Was you using vats? Vats is broken in pvp, only a select few weapons work in vats atm. Need more info to, what weapon was you using? Auto/Semi-Auto etc.
---
They changed it to Monday
---
Yup! Although Earle and Daily ops help a lot.. lots of ammo to be had
---
His reset originally was Saturday about 8pm EST. 
---
Couple weeks later, it changed to Monday.  Not sure the exact time; I‚Äôve been able to buy gold as early as 9a EST Mondays.
---
Nope, it always locks the V keys, pretty odd as they are not related binds, just a code glitch.
---
Those are the rules of the game. So what are you going to do now?
---
To all. I pay monthly and I see it. It‚Äôs always at the bottom under the vaulting soon one. But they don‚Äôt let you know if it‚Äôs fallout first or just a discount. Like right now it‚Äôs the moth man bundle but I already got but again idk if that for fallout first members or everyone. But I know back during season 1 every day there would be a new one every day for a week. It‚Äôs nice, but there‚Äôs a page we can look at atomic shop stuff for the week. I should prob look at it
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
It's just a fan-made image
---
My metal roof hasn't been either. Getting rained on through 2 floors and a roof right now.
---
Ah thanks, will try tgat
---
That‚Äôs not happening!  :)
---
Very much so. I main it and am so tired of no reflex sight or suppressor.
---
Let us know!
---
Food and water dude. Stay nourished!
---
Also I noticed class freak is broken often. If you check your stats you will often see the negative effects of mutation on again. You have to remove the card from the stack and the re-add it to "reset" things.
---
I thought as long as you have one of the prefixes it‚Äôs good. Like I have a bloodied limb damage mini that‚Äôs has a faster fire rate which would make it magic right?
---
The backside of foundation has been being built up too. I like the slow progression of certain sites. Gives the game a sense of life.
---
Oh good. I usually just skip through it but damn he's annoying. I'll try that next time.
---
To many cooks.
---
Actually I‚Äôve just set up a new CAMP down from the overseers house selling level 25 and under weapons and armor for their cap value, just to get rid of some. Yes, on PC, ign same as here.
---
You have a good point, about time I invested in a gaming mouse, I'm not a serious gamer really and just make do with a silent Logitech jobby.
---
?????????????????????????????????????
---
Iv been using my instagting one since patch 22 dropped. Youd be suprised at what I'm 1 hitting.
---
‚ÄòToo‚Äô ;)
---
Yes for him he was there  for minutes before he went through the wall genius  im not an idiot.
---
I saw a locked card too @ lvl 626.
---
The Free States.
---
I like that it takes the "Y'all Queda" armed militia concept and flips it completely around.  These people were played off like kooks, with their survival bunkers and anti-government views.  But in the Fallout universe, they were completely justified in doing this.
---
I wish they would bring more camp related Item which are in theme of BRC. Like you can make your own caravan trading post.
---
This is different, we literally couldn't use the item in the PTS so we couldn't test it. Not being able to test anything at all is a loy different from using said item in pts and them doing something about it.
---
So your complaint is that you tried to do an event you're not capable of doing?
---
lmao people are really butthurt about having to eat and drink huh. guess you guys couldnt handly hardcore/survival mode in the older games
---
Some bloodied builds are OP in pvp if it's done correctly. A lot also spam quantums etc to, maybe he wasn't fast enough on his spamming üòÇ.
---
It unlocks at level 300 according to the description
---
Thanks for the advice Hicks
---
Slow guns need a tweak up imo.  I decided to drop sneak rifle s as the damage output is shit and you get shot a ton between shots, and ended up spending most of my time with a flamer barrel plasma gun, which just melts shit in seconds.  With the ammo legendary perk and ops ammo farming I can actually maintain ammo for it and it works with my rifle perks.
---
I sense that the Mothman shits coming, Bethesda‚Äôs just biding it‚Äôs time. Which is good, because anything half-baked would hurt them even more. I say let them take their time and come up with a proper Mothman update
---
My ap runs just like if I don‚Äôt have the card on
---
You right, my bad
---
I maxed exploding palm &amp; have hack+slash at 2 stars &amp; if I use vats &amp; get both to proc I can one-hit lvl 100 enemies.
---
Fireproof doesnt effect laser damage.
---
I beleive it works like this. Lets say you have 250 ER. For ease of numbers, lets say the assaultron does 250 damage with its laser (no idea its actual damage, but that sounds about right).
---
Your ER would half its damage to 125 received.  After that your % damage reductions are applied. So your trouble shooter set which reduces damage a further 55% which is 56.25 damage. Approximately 1/5 your life. 
---
Thats how it works to my understanding.
---
Mmhm.  But your post indicates you think this problem would've been figured out day 1 of PTS.  I have no doubt the players would have *found* the issue and given *plenty* of feedback on it, but I have absolutely no faith in Bethesda figuring out a solution when the feedback was given.  We would just have gotten a non-functional item from day one instead.
---
Just blast away, most people just want the plans and outfit.
---
Nothing special drops from the boss.  Play the game how you want to
---
Great advice thanks
---
True true
---
It's called patch 22 isnt that great outside of legendary perks and daily ops, one wasteland is meh, it's got it's ups and downs, I would go without it, but at least I'm always getting max level nocturnal pipe wrenches! Seriously tho, everything is quite a but more difficult with 22, daily ops are a mess because stealth builds are worthless, as well as in some cases requiring a melee weapon to kill a single enemy. And just roaming around is rough too, level 100 super mutants and ghouls chasing you around with 10 times their normal health? Fucking ticks and anything that attacks in groups absolutely destroying bloodied builds, its waaaaay easier for lower levels, brought my level 6 buddie to fight earle, he didnt die a single time while here I was level 152 dying every few seconds to one of the spawns, anyway I think I'm rambling a bit here, what was I saying again?
---
I'm surprised PA Jetpack plans have any value at all.
---
They used to be throwaway. I guess finally fixing the jetpacks gave them some value again.
---
I would absolutely love one if you're ever free! That's the only new addition to the update that I want and I cant find it aaaanywhere
---
Haha I like that run and gun idea.  I will look into the jetpack, does it require power armor?
---
Yes.  Just follow the leader and stay by the beacon.  Kill what you can.  You will be helping a lot simply doing that.
---
Just a heads up. It's most useful with high agility, since it uses your ap. Ap regen is important as well.
---
Well I won't be doing the nuclear winter challenge
---
Sort of unrelated, but seasons in this game feel like a part time job, and it's all for mediocre rewards I'll probably never use.
---
Had to finally quit.
---
I just can't get myself to go through it again.
---
It was infinitely better when we got atoms for dailies and weeklies.
---
It's sad that this game continues to disappoint with the potential it has.
---
No not unless your wearing that armor piece from what I‚Äôve seen
---
Yes! It‚Äôs awesome!
---
I‚Äôm sad that the Buy/Sell challenge is down to 1. Whatever will I do without the extra 2 caps per day?
---
Yes I got the vault 94 jumpsuit 3 times ffs
---
Man I guess I really should go back to angry turtles video. Thanks
---
Yeah, that happened to me a couple times.  Logged out and back in and it was fine
---
There is one daylie timer. Spec ops is currently one hour off, but bethesda already said they will make it one hour earlier so it resets with challanges. 
---
Scrips, bullions and caps are set on 20h after your first purchase, so it should align with your daylie routine. Imho there is no need for these on a timer, not a single player would be harmed if they remove caps, scrips and bullion daylie limitation. Its long enough Ingme now, so the grind should be done for veterans. Why not make it available for everyone, once its no longer recent? Almost all other games adjust stuff like that.
---
Is it worth me switching to heavy from rifle?  I've been trying to buff my current BLD build as best I can but can't seem to get it higher. I lost a fair chunk of dmg with the nerf that's for sure.
---
Chemist, I have almost a thousand stimpaks
---
I have no use for bullion.  I do them for the xp and guaranteed legendary.
---
Why do the hard work of farming? ;)
---
Used to be that big open building at Big Bent Tunnel West entrance. Their main outpost that had a terminal with some lore, a magazine spawn point and a kitchen stocked up with food.
---
Just powering off will only stop them from showing on the map, the machines themselves will still be accessible. 
---
If you are afraid you will lose your stuff you should remove your vendors in their entirety (and probably take care of your punch bowl to, while you are at it).
---
Tried again and I can bind to number pad Enter this time, must be a glitch, the middle mouse still locks V LOL üòÇ
---
Maybe it‚Äôs me but I feel like you don‚Äôt get nearly as much xp for kills in daily ops so taking all the kills seems to be a wash imo (other than getting ammo back).
---
Crying about patch 22 is what you were doing. The patch it anot that bad. My alt is a stealth build, and a rifleman, and it functions fine. People are just bitching to bitch. Sorry you can't one tap everything now, and enemies are actually a threat. Boo hoo.
---
My grandpa always joked that he hated marksmanship training when he was in Army boot camp, because he is named William and the drill sergeant would shout "Fire at Will!"
---
I run a piece of TShooters armor.. also always have a decent TShooters weapon.. because.. fukka ASSaultrons and high lvl Gutsys...
---
i dont make any of the chems. i just dont use the ones i collect. i sell them. 
---
cant sell stems, radaway, or rad x .. no one buys them lol so they get stock piled to hand out, or sold to bots if im desperate. 
---
get a faster fire vamp gun and you will get more stems then you will ever use
---
The iten couldn't be tested so Bethesda didn't do anything about it. It functions by giving us strength but shouldn't stack indefinitely
---
Refrigerator mod. Cooked food lasts forever.
---
Heavy is great. You make up for the nerf by just shooting more bullets. It‚Äôs a complete different playstyle. I don‚Äôt even use power amor any more with the secret service armor being so strong.
---
And that he refuses to spec for because apparently having good armor and weapons is such a terrible thing.
---
Either will, I. Mainly because I‚Äôm absolutely terrible at NW.
---
Some enemies will not rush you. Humans, Super Mutants, some scorched. 
---
Morgantown airport is possibly a good place to go to grind XP. Your intelligence stat will help so mentats or any intelligence boosting gear.
---
On Tuesday Meat Week starts so once an hour there is an event to get legendary gear. 
---
It's a tactical shooter at level 20, so you will need to engage, then disengage. This is very much in line with the fallout games, I tried playing New Vegas yesterday a and really struggled with a new character. 
---
I see so many people struggling at low levels but you are supposed to think about your build and what will help, that's the point of Fallout.
---
This game has finally become that.
---
Even my legacy twoshot explosive gauss rifle is a shadow of it's former glory.  It's really disheartening.  I can give a bit more advice though:  For daily ops, run a railway rifle.  You can't sneak in there anyway, and it has incredibly high base damage and armor penetration.  11/10 my quad hits about as much as my friends bloodied 25ffr 25 vats cost fixer.
---
I know at least the ammo you get from the final reward gets added to your inventory as soon as you kill the final boss. I assume the rest are the same. And there is a timer on the objectives section of the hud that tells you how long you have to collect stuff before it boots you.
---
Nah, they rather spam more stims and rad-x filler then giving us something valuable.
---
There are also NPC's listed as "soldiers" south and west of Watoga
---
Definitely less VATS, and even less again if I've got Dodgy equiped. A few tweaks here and there. Dumped the SS gear I had grinded for and went back to my sentinels stuff. Too early to tell but I almost feel like my exploding weapons are beating out my FFR, and now that we no longer have the trail fireworks reload "feature" the FFR seems like too many reloads for me
---
Since your all on a team, the only thing people miss out on is XP for kills, really the point is the reward
---
Without him we live in darkness. He will save us when the night is long and dark and full of terrors.
---
Been maining plasma flamer since the patch.  The ops ammo farming and the legendary ammo perk are keeping me in ammo without much effort, and the damage is great.
---
Blast away pal. I will melt everything with my BE flamer without a second thought.
---
OMG.  I know all this.  Are you winding me up?  Am I being huckled?
---
No. Well...both.  But I was aiming when he stopped at 10%. And I hit him a bunch after that...he was just standing there letting me.
---
The basement in the house at Orwell Orchards has been redone too to make way for a future bunker there.
---
Yeah its too much of a gamble. If nuclear winter didnt take so damn long to load and start, these challenges might be a little more pallettable
---
Time for a weapons upgrade and a perk check.
---
It is important that your perks match the weapon  types you are using.
---
If you have lots of QOL or crafting perks equipped at all times, those need to change out of for DMG or DMG mitigation perks.
---
Swap out ony when you need to.
---
Lucky hole mine will provide you with up to about 600 lead ore - thats a ton of ammo.  
---
thers an iron deposit in the woods just to the east of Bolton greens golf course, and an acid deposit Just east of that.  Just to the west of Bolton greens, copper.
---
If your fighting mobs that regen hp like gulpers then yes they did regenerate their hp.

If you die from any other mob they do regenerate their hp if their not in combat after awhile.
---
But since you say it‚Äôs vats and they regen most their hp back then it‚Äôs the game. It has something to do with how damage is calculated on your side and the server where as the server says No your doing this much damage.
---
It‚Äôs like where some instances someone holds down their 500 round mini gun and automatically reloads at 100 or 150. Your client and the server are working separate and can lead to results such as these.
---
They work properly.  What are you expecting from a military killing machine???
---
I understand that crickets and ghouls shouldn't one-shot you with good armor, but gutsys and agressotron are produced to kill shit.
---
So you swap them?  Can‚Äôt use two at once, right?
---
Repairing camp should just be free to fuck with griefers
---
Yeah I don't run PA as it is. Full set of unyelding SS. Running with. BLD fixer and BLD 10 MM SMG.  MY fixer isn't doing what it should even with the nerf , maybe it's me or how I have the setup.
---
True, although I don't love fighting Earle. It sucks to be a stealth commando and deal 75% of the damage to him just to get killed right as Earle dies because embers start falling on me
---
I had them favorited, and still managed to scrap them. Twice.
---
The sixth normally unlocks when you hit level 300. If you were already 300 or above when it came out it will not usually trigger. A fix should come out with patch 24.
---
*when it turns out to be Todd Howard's alt*
---
Good luck, mate.

More Power Armor skins üôÑ

My vampires explosive 50 cal is a God send for daily ops. Highly recommend a vampires fast fire rate heavy weapon for all daily ops, preferably one without spin up.
---
&gt;it wasn't right that bloodied was doing 4 or 5 times the damage of other builds, it needed leveling.
---
IMO, it's not "right" that weapons base their entire calculation on an unmodded base damage number either.  The mods should count like they did before, as *mods to base damage*, and *then* you do your additive perks on top of that.
---
Because otherwise, you end up with posts like this - why isn't 20% actually 20%?  "Oh, because it's based on this magic number you can't see unless you put your gun into its default state."
---
Idc about one tapping enemies anyway, I never did, my build ain't that good lol, I use my main character and swap my builds around on there, so rn I'm in the middle of swapping from pa heavy to bloodied stealth commando, so I was never one tapping anything lol, I'm not crying about it, I'm fine with enemies being stronger, just make it so they cant one shot the player while the player cant one shot them and that's all fine and dandy with me, also dont have some of the previously weakest enemies being max level. The update is fine, but stealth is impossible in daily ops, I'd prefer if they had a different bonus that rotates, so it's not always perception boost, and then itll be perfect
---
A full set of buttressed secret service armor and a few perkcards that bulk up resistances does the trick for me.  They can still whittle me down, but they aren't one- or two-shoting me....
---
But you are right - the are currently the only creature besides Earl spit that puts the fear of god in me.
---
They have built-in AA abilities, just like the SuperMutants with Miniguns - they shred you like you weren't even wearing armor.
---
That's why I specifically have a TS set of armor I use for Silos, AWOL Armaments &amp; Encryptid...it takes a whole host of Gutsies to bother me now.
---
I can only get one rare drop a day
---
Once a day
---
I believe my solo record is 6:13..in a group, I believe the best we've done is 5:50.
---
They hurt, but they don't really give me much trouble in power armor, especially with a medic pump.
---
Assaultrons used to be a problem, but Electrical Absorption makes them MUCH easier with their head laser healing me quite a bit and restoring my fusing core.
---
What platform are you .... I‚Äôm PS4.  That might be the difference too.
---
All I know is, I like playing as an archer .... but it needs some cleaning up from the programming side.  They tried to fix something they determined was an ‚Äúexploit‚Äù (pretty sketch considering how long they took to fix other glaring exploits that actually impacted the overall game play of the majority of players), and in the process made certain game playing scenarios for the small amount of archers very clunky and glitchy.  One Wasteland, and its buffs to mobs with nerfs to players can make those clunks and glitches very  annoying when playing solo and you get surrounded by level 75-100 ghouls/glowing ghouls or other melee based baddies.
---
Pharmacist - because I carry quite a bit of aid / drugs...and I wanted those extra 3 points in Strength for other things.
---
My loadscreen photos are all bases I've blown up so Im always looking for more photo opportunities
---
Each rank gets you a chance for a rare. First rank has a 5% chance. Second rank has a 10% chance. Elder has an 80% chance. Once you unlock a rank a day you won‚Äôt get a chance to get the rewards again until the next day when it refreshes.
---
A Gamma Gun is probably better at this, since it naturally weighs a lot less (unless you've got a reduced weight Assaultron head).
---
Yeah has the same but getting better at keeping an eye on my health and moving around
---
No I think their complaint is that before the nerf they could enjoy playing with a crossbow and still take part in events like this and now lesser weapons struggle with the nerf/enemy scaling which would lead players into all having to use the similar faster firing weapons and build which not everyone want to use . I appreciate the problem , for higher level players who favour these , events like this just got a little more  interesting. So it‚Äôs a double edged sword . hopefully bethesda will either buff novelty or lesser weapons or release some new legendary perks that increase their usefulness such such as a Robin Hood one , dual pistol wield etc
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware the bonus increase chance for rares. That you get for completing the three time marks, only counts once a day. The base you can do as many times as you want, at like a 10% chance or less.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I do. One armored one high capacity. I keep armored on 90% of the time, but when I need it it‚Äôs an immediate extra 90 lbs
---
Probably spamming quantums then, a lot of pvpers open there pip boy then spam them, insta health and AP refill. There are also a few broken perks and aid items in pvp which it could of been, the thing with pvp is that it's been left to rot and people have found perks and other things to exploit, and as I said the quantums that got mass duped make up 90% of the "average" pvpers build. Bloodied also gets stronger in that situation, with serendipity and blocker proccing, that with their armor and lone wanderer to... If they were alone that is. Then there is Psychobuff, magazines, it's a bit of a mess tbh. I only still pvp because I have from the start but it's shit and boring, either everyone is a mile in the sky with legacy energy weapons or invisible with a tesla.
---
Lately I've noticed that unless you put the keycard in yourself, you can't use the targeting equipment. I don't know if that's due to being on a team with the person who put the card in or not, but it's been that way for a month or so.
---
Any chance you'd be willing to add on the daily rotation item from the Atom shop to these? I don't think its doing it this week, but it usually does.
---
Yeah, sure. I‚Äôll do it when there‚Äôs a rotating week.
---
That's really useful, thank you!
---
Those floors will be perfect for my command center/lab/astronaut habitat.
---
Wow look another beneficial ‚Äúexploit‚Äù being fixed while all the other major game breaking ones get ignored, thanks Todd.
---
Just drop the Floater Grenades, they are garbage even with all Exolosives perks equiped.
---
It definitely still works. Sometimes the bait wont explode by itself. Youll need a bloatfly syringer and a freind willing to die to trigger them
---
Solo in about 6 minutes, impressive
---
I love it!
---
If you don‚Äôt have secret service armour I‚Äôd recommend that. Another question what weapon/ legendary modifiers do you have?
---
yeah i guess being low level makes you bad. not the games fault that the game makes you bad because youre low level lol.
---
jesus what a bad take.
---
Precisely my blight soup has to stay good its a 3 star perk card by itself
---
Ahhh.... this explains a lot. I ran Elder 7 times and only received one drop. I think that 80% stat is BS.
---
...You're definitely in the minority with this one
---
The whitespring IS more dangerous than flatwoods, the golfclub has what ? 13-15 personal space invaders, flatwoods will see you considerably less swamped, bloated glowing ones also dish out significantly more rads, just be glad they don't chain resurrect like in FO4.
---
It's a "weak" feral because it has less resists and fewer offensive options, so yeah it IS called a "weak feral ghoul" for a reason, that reason just does not include "is capped at lvl 6".
---
Even if a molerat and deathclaw are the same level, the molerat is a nuisance, the deathclaw is a problem, because a molerat is slower, does not stagger and deals NOWHERE near the same damage.
---
Symbolism.
---
Luckily I have the bloatfly stringer.  You people keep me going.
---
Just look up the base damage of each
---
Dude, they (and assaultrons) are working as intended.  
---
Some enemies SHOULD be very scary without specific equipment and strategies.
---
I always choose critical savvy maxed first. I like more consistent crits. Then I go better criticals, but I've only got one point into that now with my current build. If I was going to build an even more critical based build I would probably invest in grim reapers sprint, as crits are useless if you're out of AP. Just my two bits
---
If ye haven‚Äôt got a chemist or grocers pack would definitely need that, save perk points from traveling pharmacist or thru hiker. Ironclad since you ain‚Äôt gonna be using power armor. I would vouch to putting points into another set of weapons, like big guns, pistols, shotguns, I would just choose 1, I like big guns since melee isn‚Äôt the best against bosses.
---
Platform?
---
I like things as they are now. It is difficult but doable solo if you are experienced and prepare properly. Forcing a 4-stack of experienced players to have any chance of reaching the highest reward will be trash based on the history of the game. Everything that forced competent players to cooperate ended up dying out. The majority of this game's playerbase is too casual to even seek out a place like this to talk about it, so anybody getting matched with randoms is almost guaranteed screwed. People don't like having content locked behind that in a game like this. Just look at how poorly the vault raids did, and how long it took for project paradise to become a ghost town. Look how many people still bitch about people not knowing how to fight the ISS to this day. This would not work out
---
I haven't noticed any differences - in fact, I just about solo'ed Earle just the other day, since there was only one other guy in the event &amp; he kept dying.
---
I recommend getting some Big Gun Bobbleheads &amp; Psychobuff for the added damage &amp; make sure you aim for the head (oh, and Stabilized Perk if you are in PA).
---
role playing "play the game YOUR way" at its finest hahaha!
---
Ps4
---
Good to know. I have done it several dozen times without issue.
---
I just jumped on my level 25, didn't have damage perks or even lone wanderer equipped, didn't even use any legendary weapons. I breezed through some scorched and super mutants without dying once, no problem. Does it get harder as you get closer to level 50?
---
SOON at a bunker near you...
---
Which pieces are you looking for? Also your level?
---
Or instead of extra time the less people people there are the less health enemy's have and objectives fills quicker
---
I‚Äôm a big fan of the ‚Äúplace a NW camp 3 times‚Äù. I can load in solo in a bare spot on the map, plop that thing down a few times then try and stay alive.
---
str  
---
faster swing speed  
---
more damage at full health  
---
Its for my gf so not 100% sure but I believe that is what she has, she carries 2. Thats her better one. The other is pretty similar but more damage while lower they are at lower health.
---
I was level 450 on Tuesday and all 6 unlocked for me.
---
If i didn‚Äôt click options to view the ops log do I just lose the rewards for that day?
---
I've been sinking my caps into Mutation Serum Recipe's, I just finished a full suit of SS armor ( including helmet ). Now I'm working on SS Power Armor.
---
Exp earned is reduced down to about a quarter, and the only loot from enemies is ammo/stims/explosives. If they aren't using up any ammo, they don't really miss out on looting it either. Getting a good time for better chances at the best rewards is far more important than getting those two molotovs from the boss
---
Oh shit that is a good idea and I think I have an AA ffr one sitting in my inventory. For some reason during the last sale mumbles gifted me a few quality RR rifles, maybe it‚Äôs time to choo choo choose one and give it a shot. 
---
Edit to add: plus the ammo only requires steel to make saving my precious .45 and 5.56.
---
You know, I bet that fire damage legendary perk would fix that problem for me. I may test it out. The legendary perks were the best addition in my opinion. I feel like Bethesda finally added something specifically for the older players which I personally think they need more of. We're the ones funneling money into the atom shop for dumb aesthetic bs lol
---
I downvoted you but then i felt like an ass and i decided i should just better try to help you...
---
‚ñ™ Get your Excavator PA and go at the "Lucky hole Mine", it's right next to "Fort Defiance". There's a bunch of Lead ore in there. You Excavator PA will extract more from the deposits !
---
‚ñ™ Place your camp on an Acid deposit to always have Acid for all this lead ore.
---
‚ñ™ To finish...always take your loot ( weapons ) ! Desmantling guns with the "Scrapper" perk card will provide you of all the steel you will ever need !
---
And with the addition of the new Legendary perk card "Ammo factory"...ressource wise...we are full !
---
I am at level 17 I have a power armor chassis but no parts
---
&gt;Three simultaneous twenty rolls
---
been there. done that. ;)
---
I hardly ever wear PA - in fact, I only wear it for Earle, to take advantage of the Stabilized Perk.
---
It would be cool to have essentially high level/optimized exclusive gear though.  I mean gear only for those types of people.  As it is, 8 minutes is an absolute cakewalk
---
Which affixes does it have ?, mine is Instigating Explosive.
---
From my knowledge you cant get power armor parts before level 25. Once you're level 25, look up how to get Excavator power armor on youtube. It's a very simple process, just go here, grab this key card, read this terminal, and bam plans for the armor.
---
‚ÄúPeople should be able to play how they want‚Äù
---
If you‚Äôre unwilling to make your build more powerful by using a small selection of perks, don‚Äôt play the game. It‚Äôs that simple. It‚Äôs supposed to get harder as you go along, it shouldn‚Äôt be piss easy the entire game. All it takes is 12-15 perk slots to have a decent build, you can literally use the rest as QOL and role playing perks, whatever you want. And if you still don‚Äôt want to make a build, but you still play the game and complain? You‚Äôre a lazy bum
---
Actually playing like a bloodied stealth commando for a  change, did messenger event and after dying quickly at beginning  I started moving high ground to high ground keeping him covered rather than trailing alongside one shoting everything. Looking forward to trying out all the usual old haunts again and seeing where I need to be a bit more strategic
---
If you learn the glitches, you can quickly drop a nuke on their camp while they are busy with the stolen launch. You just need another card and know when their camp is.
---
Bottom line is it is your nuke so have fun.
---
I‚Äôve played NW nearly every day since I started in July and I think I‚Äôve killed like two players ever lol. (One of them was the last remaining player fending off a scorchbeast while I was hiding in a bush üòÇ)
---
No, you sell them to vendor bots.
---
They need to be a faction for sure.
---
Depends what level or how good effects are, if they are low level just drop em to a low level player. If they‚Äôre unwanted but half decent effects, just ask around or drop it to someone while at an event.
---
Christ, with that name id expect a nuke to hit your camp at any moment haha
---
Found a bug with Locked and Loaded. It stops working every time you exit power armor- at least with Speed Demon. Haven't tried it without. I have to unequip it and re-equip it every time.
---
Pretty cool mods, but honestly it just makes me want them to put in the Proton Axe/Protonic Inversal Axe from Old World Blues. Loved that thing.
---
Here's a failed strategy... I have chemist and grocers, but I find grocers always reduces my carry weight more, so I've never had a circumstance where I used chemist. I do tend to sell most of my drugs daily and any stim-packs over 25. The downside of grocers is any time I put on power armor, my carry weight shoots above 500, and I'm immediately overburdened, which then eats my AP. So, really it's going to depend on your play style, and habits.
---
Really? Even before the patch 8/10 people I saw over level 30 were in power armor.
---
Ill add you later not on for another 3 ish hours. Ign is caserman
---
Troubleshooters armor will be your best friend.
---
3 out of the 6 days I've ran it I've gotten nothing rare. I think its just bad rng
---
I have a steel series rival. Nothing fancy. Couple of extra buttons. Nothing too crazy
---
While I agree with you in principle, your idea would reduce the # of items we can sell and scrip every day (since we are currently doing this every 20 hours). If Bethesda raised or removed the daily limits, hell yes.
---
Agreed!
---
The game dropped me an IE lever rifle last night and I had a blast 2-3 shooting everything as a rifleman. It‚Äôs no longer a one shot killer, but I wanted that gun for the longest time. I‚Äôm not gonna let the nerf take my fun away.
---
They‚Äôre rather obnoxious - yesterday wasn‚Äôt too bad since I didn‚Äôt need to kill them with melee, but they still have a lot of health, and some can very quickly do a whole lot of damage
---
No worries let me know and I‚Äôll log in with that toon
---
So if you don't get elder on first run you are S.O.L. right?
---
It just works.
---
His winning what? Poodle? Hamster?
---
Sounds interesting, might have to get me one of those lol, followed someones advice on another comment and pulled out my gauss rifle to try, the damage output is much better but the mag size is an issue lol
---
Yeah, I dont know what I was doing while I was making my psn
---
Not at all. You can keep trying until you get elder. As soon as the rank is unlocked it will give you some rng and will choose the reward or you won‚Äôt get a reward because there is a 20% chance for no reward at elder rank.
---
Plasma cores do not sell (in my fairly well trafficked store at least) until I drop them to 20 at most. But if I‚Äôm having weight problems and just want to move them within the day, I‚Äôve found 12 or even 10 caps each to be the right price.
---
Just consider it free pocket change in exchange for ammo you‚Äôd have otherwise thrown away. Each time someone buys a core or two, you essentially get a fast travel somewhere nice for ‚Äúfree‚Äù. You don‚Äôt make the *real* money without selling something harder to get than cores.
---
You can definitely still do sneak/commando, etc
---
in your vendor
---
It‚Äôs not gone for me. But I‚Äôve personally had a huge decrease in the amount of times it‚Äôll happen to me.
---
I had thought about how my build is useless in the current uplink daily op due to the perception property negating my stealth. I think using power Armor would mitigate the problems I was having without having to manage my builds. Perhaps others thought this too?
---
It's supposed to be 80% for Elder rank but I don't believe it. People love to cry RNG but come on.
---
Have a look at these spawn points. You‚Äôll only be able to use Raider parts until lvl 25 though
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76)
---
Honestly I‚Äôve already allotted stash space for 100 stimpaks and I can‚Äôt afford more space for them. I have to carry way more of them on person now and I don‚Äôt really have the cw, though the chem backpack mod kinda fixed that. 
---
Truth is I burn through stims and mats so quickly now that it‚Äôs just not worth it. The grind for better legendaries is the only incentive to keep playing. Considering I already have decent gear, it makes me think why am I doing this? The slight dps improvement won‚Äôt change my experience or effectiveness. even if it did, what‚Äôs the point? I can‚Äôt even chill and explore anymore. I can‚Äôt build half my camp because budget. What I can build gets destroyed. The grind used to be for bullion and scrip now it‚Äôs for boring ol mats. It‚Äôs just not fun.
---
Great pic!
---
Vampire Gatling Plasma. That is all.
---
you just said youre level 5. how about you go actually play at those levels and then you can try to tell those of us who are palying at those levels how were supposed to feel about facts and numbers that have an obvious effect on game play.
---
I always thought glowing meat and glowing meat steaks were overpriced, based on how frequently they drop. You can supplement them in your economy by looting and selling combat rifles, combat shotguns and assault rifles. Plus don't forget to pick up and then sell all the screws and fiberglass during A Colossal Problem.

Pepperoni rolls are why I always jump into the Blue Ridge Caravan event if I see it active.

"Use a Stimpak" isn't too bad either. I usually load into Morgantown station. Lots of suitcases and other containers, and the edge of the nuclear ring of fire is right there a hundred yards away.
---
Wow I really figured that was the case I have done Elder rank all but the first day and only gotten the Solar Panel plan. And that was the time I got Elder first try. Just my luck I guess. Thank you for the info!!
---
Kinda bummed the op hasnt reset. Hopefully we get one today
---
Decent, must be nice to game up with your girlfriend too

Can you remove the Pip-Boy from your arm? No, no you can not.

Most of your questions are answered here so I won't repeat them, but here's my two cents:
---
Re: public teams. Always be on one. If there's no space, make your own. There are so many perks and mutations that benefit you and your team, it's always worth it. Join casual for the INT boost, as this translates to more EXP gains. Join daily ops team if you want to do daily ops, that's how you'll find others who want to do it.
---
Speaking of daily ops - as a low level player you'll find it pretty difficult. The how-to is easy - run to marker, stay in market area until the bar in the upper right fills up. Unlike some other events, you won't get any hate here for being a low level player. Everyone doing daily ops wants more bodies to stand by the markers, this speeds up the bar, speeds up the time of completion, and benefits everyone in the daily op. So join a team, fast travel to a team member if beside their name on the map it says (in daily op), and then just follow their lead.
---
Level-wise, you're getting close to some big build decisions. Either way, you'll want starched genes and class freak in LUCK as soon as you can get them. This allows you to get and keep mutations you want without the negatives. Unlike early on in the game, getting mutations is easy now and you won't need to grind for them. Find player camps with a decent number in the MISC category and you'll likely find serums for sale for 250-500 caps. Don't pay more than that. No matter what your build is, there will be at least a handful of mutations that will help you greatly.
---

It feels like they are pushing the meta to make more legendary prefixes situationally more valuable.  They've probably been trying that for a while with events like Encryptid but people decided not to do it all instead of getting alternate equipment. 
---
Ill know this is the point when we start getting Night Missions to make the Nocturnal worth getting.

There‚Äôs also a perk where for each point of strength adds damage resistant (barbarian) but getting good secret service armour is really strong
---
Are you kidding? I reach my 1400 caps limit within an hour of playing.
---
The daily ops have been out for barely any time. If everyone could get all the rewards in the first few days then no one would have a reason to keep repeating them. Give it a month and you'll see them going for 500 caps in player vendors like collosal problem ones.
---
Totally this. I fell in with a team of lvl 200+, and we ran through the event 7 times in a row under 6 minutes. Pure heaven.

Fair enough. To me, if there was an official mention of them having gone extinct, that would mean that they do exist in the lore officially, as an extinct species. However, why I said they don't exist in the lore is that they've not been mentioned anywhere aside from I think an NPC referring to spiders at some point, and the Wastelad game having giant spiders in it (which might just be a fantasy creature.)
---
Someone had posted a comment mentioning the old adage "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" in one of the threads I came across when looking up spiders in Fallout, and I think it fits nicely here; we don't know about spiders in Fallout as they haven't been mentioned in the lore of Fallout (hence why I said they don't exist in the lore), but that doesn't mean that they don't exist in the Fallout world; there might be spiders somewhere, and especially this early in the timeline (2103, in Fallout 76.)
---
Also I noticed my earlier comment had been garbled for some reason. I think there was some kind of a error when I posted it or edited it. Only noticed it now. Sorry about that. It should be a bit more readable now.

So do I but I'll wager that unwanted legendaries weigh more than whatever you're selling to reach those 1400 caps. Unless it's already even more unwanted legendaries...

Clearly a lot of people don't have unwanted legendaries I guess lol.

Yes. It was so satisfying. Went to valley galleria and blew up almost every car there with a single shot.

Do the wastelanders questline before the main quest. Do both raiders and settlers quests until you get to "siding with" quests from both sides, then choose the one you want. After you finish completely, you have access to more rewards, currency, and loads of plans that you won't be able to get otherwise.

VATS was all over the shot (no pun intended) earlier today. If my target is a short distance from me there is no justifiable logic as to why my shot is missing its target in VATS.
---
When I gain most of the rewards from Armour Ace I am considering making a giant military base
---
Yep but hearing the hum of 8 mini nukes fly through the air is really scary but entertaining.
---
Thin air
---
Maybe she wants to be locked in the basement with Davenport and all those pesky vault dwellers keep disturbing them so Davenport sends them on pointless 'intel' missions.
---
I missed the Survival Shortcut...may have to redo my 6th perk.
---
You lose 'em, they vanish into the thick radiated air.
---
The caps disappear
---
That's why I have friends with benefits only.
---
Try a junkies build
---
Bethesda taxes lol
---
I could be wrong but I think it‚Äôs an hour after reset
---
If your still in the low lvl range make throwing knives or tomahawks. They save tons of ammo and deal a great deal of damage at lower levels.
---
There's also a greenhouse just north of the Nuka factory that has a barn next to it. That barn used to be open and full of scorched, now it's closed and there are no enemies there.
---
Toss your gaming system, your an addict. It's going to ruin your life if you can't stop. Drop all your stuff in the game and delete your characters.
---
You are certainly most welcome
---
You get about 10 shots off even with gunsmith at rank 5 with 200% durability.
---
Not surprising. They mentioned more coming with BRC in the AMA reddit thread if I recall correctly. The further changes to the Big Bend were mentioned either in one of ITV or by PTS players. I just want more quest options. Guarding transports or even making deliveries ourselves to other parts of Appalachia could be fun. Also hoping Expeditions aren't purely BOS related and some of them involve BRC.
---
It did lol
---
have you tried killing them?
---
So obviously take all the damage perks, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, strange in numbers, etc.  My bloodied gun does like 25%more than my vampire's, but I think the massive healing is definitely worth a bit less damage
---
lowest level is 15 for Raider  PA
---
Yes it's quite stupid. I had to trade my forest pieces for the exact same but urban. Luckily I managed to find a similar chest piece in a vendor for 1400. Now I can finally run funky duds so that nuke fights arent that much of a hassle (SBQ poison attack and Wendigos)
---
It is however understandable for thorn/ solar armour.
---
if you are playing from dawn to dusk and you only have 600 hours you haven't had the game for that long.
---
It hasn't even been a whole week yet my dude. I could see if you ran it every day for like months, or even weeks. But days? Be a little more patient, it is good for your mental health.
---
high capacity. my DR is still high even with it
---
I was tracking this for a while on a spread sheet - % chance to hit vs. actual hit.
---
95% hit chance, hits about 65% of the time .... 
---
Remarkably 65-70% hit chance hits 95% of the time.
---
Small sample size (few hundred shots only) .... but the amount of misses at 95% is astounding.  You only have to play for 5 minutes to see 95% does NOT equal 95% - and the probability of missing 19 shots out of 20 at 95% (as I have done more than a couple times now) is incredibly small.
---
Not all gutsies are bad, just the colonels. Improve your armor, use Troubleshooters armor and/or weapons, or use Power Armor. Also, prioritize the colonels when there are multiple enemies. If you use concentrated fire, target the right part.
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I‚Äôd be happy to help you out in any way I can. Ammo, armor, or any chems I may have. I know it is hard at that level, but at a certain point you get over the hill and it gets so much better.
---
The person is a junkie. They impulsively take drugs ALL the time
---
Ya, she started playing first and I kinda joined in. She knows more but im more the power gamer so always looking to improve. Told her we need to get her the Secret Service uniform now that i see it gives 4str and 4 endurance.   
---
Anything like that for ranged? Im just using the basic vault jumpsuit that gives a few stats spread out. Nothing as targeted for ranged that I have found.
---
I'm having no problem with the level 100's in fact I'm enjoying all the xp they give. I'm not even a specialist damage build either. Most people having trouble are new players or players without decent legendary weapons /gear which are easier than ever to aquire these days or their build is not very good. Most enimies can be killed in a few shots even lvl 100 mutants. Division 2 has far worse bullet sponges than 76
---
We must not have run into each other then.
---
i dont mind the level 100 enemies. but please raise the level cap of gear to match them.
---
Ahhh... thanks guys!  I had a feeling, but that explains a lot. The 80% drop rate is a bit misleading. Guess there's fine print somewhere I missed.
---
True
---
There a cap limit?!?! Why?!?
---
Threaten to scrip all your wife's jewelery that will shut her complaining up üòâ
---
I've been noticing it reset at 1PM EST
---
Team:4:38 freezing robots in vault 94 I haven‚Äôt attempted a solo run my build isn‚Äôt the best yet
---
set yourself the goal to get allied with both factions and get all the bullion plans
---
it should take about 3-5 days before the grind makes you quit the game
---
jokes aside though if this post is meant serious,
---
theres no easy way to handle an addiction
---
you are at a solid point when you aknowledge having an addiction in the forst place.
---
You allready set the groundwork now think about how much that game improves your life
---
how much does your wife improve your life?
---
i bet that having a caring wife to live with benefits you more than a videogame
---
also the loss of your loved ones will be more devastating and longlasting than the loss of a hobby
---
theres no other way than to just stop playing by willpower,
---
delete reddit and dont watch youtube videos about the game, its unlikely that any of your friends or relatives will confront you with anything related to fallout76 so if you avoid thosepreviously named sources, youll soon see the game playing less and less of a role in your head
---
ask your wife for forgiveness and dedicate the near future to her, going on vacation or cook for her and make time with her count rather than just spending time together
---
if all of that isnt possible seek professional help
---
A new mutation that effects chems/addiction might be interesting.
---
Scawy
---
And I‚Äôve found like full set of t45 and t60 before I‚Äôve completed the raider armor at this point I think it‚Äôs rare haha
---
So if my vendor stock is worth N caps total, I can't carry more than 30k - N caps with me?  Otherwise I stand to lose caps if a buyer cleans me out?  And what if my stock is worth (way) more than 30k?
---
Yeah, maybe like adrenal reaction idk
---
Hey, can I also get that shotgunner build?
---
I had this earlier, West Tek was an absolute cluster fuck for me! My critical shots barely made a dent but the following shot (the ones that actually met their target) took out half the health bar?! I was like C'MON, you're killing me here...
---
Enclave under armour gives perception and strength so might help with VATS abit but other than that I‚Äôm not to sure
---
The night before one wasteland I scripped a whole set of troubles shooters SS because I never used it. Instantly regretted it üòû
---
My idea was to make it generate wireless power throughout the whole buildable area of your CAMP, regardless of its placement. It would justify its size while still only outputting the same amount of power as the fusion generator.
---
I have my camp near WSS and usually there are other camps nearby, so please use my camp
---
Make mules, level them to 50, dump all your scrip on them and use them to take more chances at the purveyor, I go through 4k scrip a week there. 
---
 Also can use them for storage with all the food build perks.
---
That‚Äôs my issue.  I‚Äôve got a ton of chems and a ton of food and drinks (nuka-colas).  I use traveling pharmacy and a grocer backpack. I chose grocers bp so not to use thru-hiker.
---
Wow! Way to go! I have to wonder what the fastest possible time could be assuming 4x on both boosters and staging players at each checkpoint to avoid travel time.
---
I never wear power armor. I use a couple vampire weapons, but don't have a specific build. I haven't had any trouble with the patch.
---
Yah it‚Äôs an inventory management game lol.  Im constantly shuffling high valued items in and out of vending depending on where my max caps are.  Time consuming...
---
I had a supermutant fighting a deathclaw while a scorchbeast is flying above them
---
Scrip and sell to vendors the shitty ones, and sell the mediocre/good ones at a discount at your camp.
---
Some weapons may be worth more than you sell them for, but if you sell them for less you get them off your hands, which is the goal.
---
6:58 solo of freezing robots is impressive! What is your build? Any tips?
---
Chemist, strength points were more useful for me.
---
He probably spawned before the camp
---
Is it ATX?
---
I'll craft you a full set of lvl 25 excavator PA if your on ps4
---
Facts
---
No you get rewards right when you kill the boss.
---
Totally missed my point. I'm not discussing if level 100 enemies are easy or hard to kill, is that West Tek isn't the place for them.
---
Want to push your limits? Go do Daily Ops. The world should be a place to do trivial activities, nothing else.
---
That's really cool. The greenhouse set is by far the best looking set. Have you considered making bridges with carpets across the gaps?
---
Example #3547 of Bethesda not testing or playing fo76
---
I agree wholeheartedly. Damage boosts that are available via legendary effects and perks feel as though they've been squished lowering the gap between minmaxed builds and normal ones.
---
Being able to go anywhere and be rewarded with good xp, while allowing people of all levels to play together has been great for me.
---
There's three chances at it, something like 5 20 then 80.
---
One time I found a ghoul that didn‚Äôt do damage or take any fighting a sheepsquatch infinitely.
---
My bloodied melee got smacked hard enough that it wasnt worth the small damage bonus anymore, so I've switched to a melee tank build I guess. PA is nice for that.
---
It goes nowhere, this happened to me just yesterday. I was sitting at about 25k caps and a whole party of people started to clean out my bullet store. I think I missed out on about 10k caps before I freaked out and server hopped. While it was unfortunate, it's my own fault for not managing my caps. From now on I'm keeping myself at 20k tops.
---
They're sent in the great vault in the sky. Jokes aside if you don't want to hit max caps from stuff you're selling, just be sure to not be near the limit.
---
And there is another reason for Beth to switch on different game engine. Some people here may be surprised by what i'm gonna say, but... new game engine can make weaponry hacking much more complicated, or even impossible.
---
But that would require money, wouldn't it? I bet some of Beth's investors don't want to spend money for making any more profit out of the game, do they?
---
Wait wait wait. Your example of a place that shouldn't have difficult enemies is west tek? I thought it'd be flatwoods or something, not the place with level 50-70 super mutants.
---
For all I know level 100 enemies don't even have more health than a level 70 super mutant pre one wasteland, it could just be a number.
---
You could ask around for unwanted legendary weapons, heard of tons of folk throwing them away due to the script cap.
---
Only the queen is immune to explosives, you would be better off with a faster rate of fire.
---
Mine is, which is the only reason I haven't scripped it.  Regular heads are like 8 fricken pounds or something like that.
---
Nope, I was farming for his outfits and caused him to spawn.
---
Fastest team was like 5:30, solo I tend to get just under 8 because I always get lost.
---
On my second character, I went to launch a nuke and was joined by two trolls. Didn‚Äôt have my Mic on, but they kept saying ‚Äúhe better nuke scorchbeast queen‚Äù and ‚ÄúI bet he doesn‚Äôt even have the codes‚Äù and overall being jackasses. It was my intention to nuke fissure site prime to complete the quest, but opted to find their camps, conveniently right next to each other, and nuke them instead. So just do that if you get PMs from people demanding you nuke a certain area.
---
mine comando. i once empty out whole mag but the damage as if i would tap and hit my target once or twice :| since that i started to tap fire, it would not register if i hold it down anyway. kinda ruin the point of being automatic rifle
---
Bruh everytime I make a daily op team on Xbox literally it gets filled and then when I start the Op everybody leaves or doesn't move.
---
The whole map is viable now. Its never been better to farm locations. 50 or 100 it's better than level 5s like it was. Earle and daily ops is definitely a good step in the right direction for end game content I agree.
---
You were correct! Just reset. Thanks!
---
How far down in the forums did you have to go to find this? This post is like three days old lol. Also I do know how to read and I‚Äôm not a bloodied build. I also started a new character to see how bad it is and it‚Äôs not easy but it‚Äôs not as bad as people say
---
We have a legendary card that boosts ammo crafting and ammo Smith plus super duper... and you want more?
---
I mean I get 10 to 60 ult ammo from mobs in daily ops for my Gatling gun. Transferring that out of it even making it a fraction of what the drops are just makes ammo in general pointless.
---
It was datamined. That‚Äôs why we have these numbers.
---
So I have heard, and I know the end game reward does. On the same heavy character, if I am running low I pop out my Prime Gatling Plasma for the boss to get more cores. Am going to grab myself an extra gat laser and leave it unprimed to keep my power armor going.
---

It has a locked badge over the 6th slot, but there doesn't seem to be any way to unlock it. even though I'm way over the required level
---
Nuke your wife's base. That'll show her.
---
Do you have extra plans for the lights and liquid courage? If so, I would love to buy it from you or trade for it if you're on ps4
---
How do you get the image in reddit so you don't have to go to the link like that?
---
Aaaaaand IT'S GONE!
---
Doesn‚Äôt feel like it.  Only gotten one rare in 5 elder completes.  Small sample size, but still
---
Just seen someone mention it before
---
I think if they did that it'd be wild. Nobody ever gets ammo they don't want?
---
I kinda liked the radio raider guy from the nuka dlc not sure why but i wish they let me meet him and do quests for him.
---
thanks, was just coming here to see if people knew how to fix this.
---
What am I missing?
---
Gotta have time gates since they don't have content engaging enough to keep players constantly playing.
---
I won't need to be level 900, I'll be done by level 630. You'll need to be 900 because, according to your count, you're missing almost 300 cards.
---
I've had lv 20 radrats [before level scaling] survive a lv 50 two shot mirv!
---
It would be cool for those people, but in the game's broken and content-dry state, it's not a good idea for them to make things specifically catering to a very tiny minority of the playerbase that will also frustrate the majority of others. A game like warframe can afford to make end-game raids and game modes that require a meta loadout because that game has enough content and flexibility for those who can't do it, and their economy has not been fucked inside out eight times so many of the rare rewards can be sold away to other players for a good profit
---
If you have an extra caged lights plan, I'll buy it from you or trade for it if you're on ps4 :)
---
Eh.  It's not too hard
---
true.
---
Yes we do, and adding ammo drops would not stop you from having to craft Ammo, just be more beneficial as a reward especially Ultracite Ammo then just an random ammo type. PLUS low levels don't have access to these perks which One Wasteland effect more then anyone over lvl 101.
---
Yeah man np!
---
I still don‚Äôt know why Bethesda can‚Äôt just make vending machines disabled if we choose to cut off their power. I mean, if lights have no power, we can‚Äôt turn them on/off. Same for other things that need some electrical source. 
---
And they are also quick to disable them when THEY choose to, to fix bugs. Likewise the weight bench. 
---
Seems simple to me, turn off power means it should disable them. But for whatever reason it seems they have no intention of letting us turn them off unless we scrap/store them.
---
I still don‚Äôt bother with the converter.  It‚Äôs just time consuming for not being intuitive (if I could just auto convert every .44 I got I‚Äôd be happy)
---
The only weight reduction perk I have on when running Daily Ops is Bear Arm 3. I run a Heavy Gunner (Vampire's Minigun) Power Armor build using the Dynamo torso mod for AP refresh when getting shot at. I ignore all the enemies when traveling to the first 4 checkpoints. Sure, I take out enemies while  staying close to Boosters A and B but I always make sure my multiplier stays at 1x (instead of 0x). Oh, and I generally don't loot the bodies until after the event.
---
Between the Power Armor, Blocker, Energy Absorption, Ricochet, Fireproof, Lone Wanderer, First Aid, Born Survivor 1, and my Vampire's weapon, I don't have to worry about incoming damage.
---
For damage output, I just have rank 1 of each Heavy Gunner perk, Tenderizer 3, and One Gun Army. But, my minigun has the +40% bash effect (and the accelerated barrel) so the magic effect does kick in which helps with the boss. If I wanted to try it with a non magic weapon I would probably use my 2* TSE 50 cal and switch to the medic pump torso mod.
---
Missing texture near the truck, when I view the horizon while looking at the thing around the truck the Garahan Estates started to unload(like the trees) and when I started seeing them outside that missing texture it loads in.
---
No assaultrons are not. They are supposed to charge up for each laser shot. They do not.
---
It works but not inside of a structure. Like if they have a rad shower outside, you can throw one at a time and they go off and damage it. Works on the side of a structure too.
---
Pretty good for me, I've had guys blow up the inside of my trap using bait. The thing with the youtubers camp is the guys were using some kind of exploit, no clue. They made a video of it and her camp blew sky high in a few seconds.
---
I used stais, but I should use rugs honestly.
---
Same here, still a time consuming UI.
---
They still get plenty of ammo to use though if they utilized how their ammo is spent.
---
When I was lower levels throwing knives were cheap to make and saved a lot of ammo.
---
If you do the work drop it where you want.  Don‚Äôt worry about everybody else.  My only two nukes ever caused a server disconnect.  I would have just as well dropping it in the edge of the map.
---
Preach!
---
Probably true.  I just wanted to know how it's being done. Taking one for the team is what auto accepts pvp.
---
I‚Äôm trying my hand at an  vats AA  stealth commando build I‚Äôve got a AA/+33 vats/+p fixer and handmade and I‚Äôve been ripping it up, gonna try to get my hands on an AA/E handmade or fixer and dump some points into demo expert. Decided to try an AA build because I didn‚Äôt want to commit extra perk points to allow a low health build, I‚Äôd rather keep my weight reduction perks. And I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the effects of withdrawals and having or maintaining a supply of drugs. It‚Äôs been pretty sweet, my character is stronger then pre patch, it would take me a long time to drop a scorchbeast with my previous build now I just see that health bar drop.
---
This is incredibly sad for some reason
---
Nice, 5:30, pretty damn good.
---
I think you mean healing factor, adrenal reaction does not affect chems/addictions.
---
Let me rephrase for the snide: 
---
a *new* mutation that *positively* effects chems/addiction would be interesting.
---
Yeah they‚Äôre still good
---
I can confirm the BE ultracite laser rifle is dead, I have one that I been trying to trade and i have gotten zero offers. I don‚Äôt know what to do with mine, I know I won‚Äôt get another legacy for it so I just took my loss and moved on.
---
What are these specific QOL perks you're referring to? Like what is it exactly that your going to miss by moving perks to damage and defense?
---
They make this item unusable but do nothing to legacy or magic weapons.  Sad.
---
They also don't give us the requisite 10mm pistol every other fallout gave us.  But some imitation seafood or other ration type food would have made sense.
---
Someone made a post that their storage was accessed through their vending machine, but they were unable to provide evidence, and so far neither has anyone else.
---
It's been several days now, so I'm not sure how credible it is.
---
I just lost a be Gatling plasma the other day. No idea where it went
---
Oh I've worded it wrong, I meant it like it works like adrenal reaction, maybe the addictions are more severe but the dmg is increased
---
Do the wastelanders questline first
---
Not sure if your first point is still the case after One Wasteland, might explain the downvotes. 
---
I thought the other points were solid advice. Upvoted.
---
That would be nice. I normally solo it so I haven't tested in a long time.
---
Happened to me last night , hope Todd Howard managed to use it and buy himself some decent animal head plans from someone‚Äôs vendor
---
What video card do you have and what graphics setting and driver are you using?
---
Maybe lol. Honestly, this isn‚Äôt even to bash bloodied builds. It‚Äôs just there have been three in two days who shoot me while at a vending machine and they all had around 20% health. So maybe I made assumptions but it seems unlikely.
---
I feel you. I was luck to get three rewards (one for each rank) a couple days ago but my gf didn‚Äôt get any that same day. Time to pray to the rng gods
---
Now that we have legendary perks, card packs is all I want.
---
Hey dude, love the camp!
---
Armor plated backpack stays on 90% of the time. The remains 10% is distributed among the other options. 
---
High capacity backpack only when I‚Äôm junk farming, or carrying a lot of weapons to scrap or sell to the vendor. 
---
Insulated backpack for when I do nuke silos or encrypted. 
---
I don‚Äôt use chemist backpack or the refrigerated backpack since I only carry 5-10 drugs on me. And my character is on a strict diet of spoiled meat and inert flux. 
---
The lead lined backpack combined with the Chinese stealth armor makes it extremely easy for me to farm flux in a nuke zone.
---
been like that for a long time
---
But tell us where and when you will be dropping stuff...so that we can *support* you through this trying time and make sure you dont just pick it all back up..
---
RTX 2080S with game ready driver Version 452.06, Playing on ultra or high(highest settings) FOV 120
---
*pushes you out* ‚Äúsorry man we gave everything to the overseer. Have some glasses and a party hat and go have fun‚Äù
---
Moments later you get shot in the knee with a laser.
---
Lol I can‚Äôt even sell them I‚Äôm constantly at max caps now... nothing to spend them on.
---
They're still worth something, try lowering the prices before you scrip them.
---
Really wow, how did I not notice
---
Oh, yes this exactly. More pain, more gain.
---
Still important imo. All them stat boosts for carry weight, ap and my personal favourite 15 to intelligence for increased xp towards levels /season pass
---
Yeah
---
What about dying to the frogs during Path to Enlightenment?  That is also... not right.
---
I'd kill for the proton axe
---
Do you loot corps and containers?  Do you use melee in close quarters?  I have more ammo than I can use. I‚Äôm rotating weapons just to manage my ammo inventory.  Maybe you can‚Äôt always run full auto if you don‚Äôt have a commando build.
---
Only got the 1 so far, sorry dude
---
Since he is a predictor of apocalyptic events (like the bridge collapse) it would be cool to have some kind of drug endused flash back to pre war Appalachia showing him somehow trying to warn the population of the impending apocalypse.
---
Stop talk shit or they add ration pack containing purified water and crams
---
Make the ammo vending machines also use it and it would be perfect.
---
Glowing blood is still a good vendor tho. Just stack hardbargain, or like a grapementat and ur set.
---
My human: There are 9 rare rewards with a ~1:28 individual chance of dropping in any given Elder-tier scenario and an additional 5 uncommon rewards with a ~1:10 individual chance of dropping in any given Elder-tier scenario. And the way probability and statistics work it'll take some time -- probably 2-3 months to get all the rewards with a ton of dupes in between. So yeah as much as I might want the War Glaive or the solar panels or the Galleria signs, and as much as you might want the BoS Ops suit it's gonna take more than [checks calendar] six days for either of us to get what they want.
---
whenever it is its gonna be cray cray with high lvl mobs everywhere now..
---
You could use power connectors for small ropes on the sides too
---
Unplayable
---
I think you forgot about the part where it just plain looks cooler than the fusion reactor.  Because it does look pretty cool.
---
I normally run it a few times a day. Like 6 or 7 pst.
---
Seriously. When I saw Rad Kit in the prizes I was like "Really? Wtf..."
---
Beth we need to stop not taking drugs. And the drugs that help us not take drugs need to stop making it so that we have to take more drugs to compensate for the drugs that eliminated the drugs that we stacked with the others drugs so that we don't have to take more drugs to........
---
You know what I mean.....
---
I can‚Äôt wait ... I‚Äôll be able to level all my baby characters lol
---
It‚Äôs in the directive for 76. The dwellers are meant to rebuild, arm, and survive without supplies from vault tec. The little stuff we get in the intro and leaving the vault is all we are to get. 
---
It‚Äôs a shame really there‚Äôs a lot of good stuff in 76 for us to use and have. Only way in now is to blow a hole in the door.
---
Oh well I meant rn but comment again when you do it and I'll help
---
Deep pocketed armor? There are so many to be honest, lol
---
I found a weird thing today, that my Armor vending machine had a Carrot listed at the same price I usually list Fasnacht masks.
---
I have no effects on any of my equipment, i'm a squishy level 25.
---
Id this why I can't find the entrance to that telescope building?
---
What would be neat is introducing a nuked mothman boss encounter
---
Yeah I have one as a secondary weapon.  Good for ops and other groups.
---
Do you call your kid Earle?
---
Yeah, this happened before patch 22 as well.   I see it more often when I shoot something for 80% or more of its health.  Or maybe I just notice it more then.
---
DEC 10 - DEC 14
---
Ah thought you meant for a group that runs it alot. You should look in the looking for group tab on xbox you can find a group pretty easy.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to set up swap meets with others. Item for item. No caps. It worked once but people thinking they are going to get scammed are hard to convince.
---
This! A nuked mothman. Where we learn that all the mothman we have seen so far are just the weaker babies or something
---
It used to be open and had a lot of cool lore, but it‚Äôs closed down now until the Brotherhood arrives soon.
---
uhhhhhhhh murmrgh would like to have a word with you
---
Damn that far away uggghhhh
---
Thanks I really wish they add a vendor bot next to murmrgh, that way people can at least dump their nocturnal broadsider from murmrgh for a few caps and move on.
---
yup :/  atleast we know it's coming!
---
How do you you find out this stuff? The game doesn't really seem to explain anything.
---
Nice ty
---
I'd love an option to have rewards go straight to my stash. I hate getting legendaries that out me over so I have to slowly walk to some where to get rid of them.
---
Yeh the other thing is newbies who have acquired an BE handmade or Laser and think they're Thor all of a sudden. They don't realise people have spent 1000s of hours making their build. I've seen more and more lately, thinking their gods then call me a Hacker because they couldn't kill me or I killed them with an insta melt.
---
For now I'm buying power armor mods for power armor I'll never use.
---
Haha. For real, if you want something changed then speak up about it
---
I'm over level 200 and I will never turn down a White Springs nuke. That's flux farm city right there.

This ^^- I only roll 3 items in a given server - if I get the prefix I want I may roll 3 more and see how it goes ... also if I‚Äôm low on modules I will sometimes wait until get a drop in the world with the prefix i am looking for, then I will roll on that server
---
It's been resetting at 1 PM EST for me, just did the new one. Explosive mutants at the Burrows, and 2nd day in a row getting Elder with no rare rewards haha
---
Free Watoga People's Party
---
3 or 4 everytime? Like. Every time?
---
&gt;Can I please nuke where I want?
---
Yes, you can.
---
&gt;I'm tired if being told that I have to nuke fissure site prime or monogah mine by people who are 3x my level
---
This isn't a thing that is happening. Bombs get dropped on the lumber yard in the northwest, the swamps in the northeast, Beckley, Watoga, and everywhere in between. People don't care where the nuke comes down if they're not launching it.
---
Well if your wife left, then the problem solved itself. More time to play now
---
Agreed. It‚Äôs a robot. It likely has some robot version of Vats inside it. A gusties repeater arm is designed to be better if not rival an army troop in terms of killing power.
---
I would say very likely, but is earning bullion any easier and it is limited to 1 character. So if you only play with 1, should be fine, if you want it on more than 1 then I would say try do it .. but yeah I am sure it will be back 1 way or another I think
---
There was a Brotherhood Broadcast (it stopped broadcasting last week) with a Brotherhood Paladin announcing their return to Appalachia, and there was an NPC outside ATLAS who was helping to fortify the place for the Brotherhood. There was a large community event where we had to donate supplies and get rewards.
---
I did Tea Time yesterday and it felt like half the server was there. Never seen anything like it.
---
Im just betting e shares some shit like green thumb
---
The way the Overseer introduces him. She sounds like she‚Äôs introducing a boyfriend or husband. It‚Äôs the tone in how she says it. That creeps me out some.
---
I can get on in a few minutes. 
---
Depending on the enemies we can probably get it done within 8 minutes.
---
I've never found that many there, at most 1-2. Elsewhere though i've noticed an increase in legendaries.
---
I was just about to say, we need enemies with more variety, variety in attacks and so on not just larger one with more health. Then I was the pert about them draining health... Yes this.
---
I agree. I laugh at gutsies. Now a mirelurk king. That hurts.
---
They haven‚Äôt fixed it in well over a year, so I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre safe for now
---
At patch 23:
---
"We have decreased legendary drop rate by 100% to address an issue of players getting legendaries at a greater rate than they can scrip"
---
I believe the FFR effect makes Tesla‚Äôs magic
---
Is working for me again, for a few days it was not and the servers were very very laggy, if i hit something it would drain the health bar but they would not drop for maybe 2-5 seconds and rubber band like crazy!
---
And damn for the sales tax, what a bitch, I guess todd has to pay his employers something at least!
---
Vampire auto is amazing in daily ops. I can get through an op without a stimpak.
---
If you have no timer, then you are using an outdated mod.
---
Gauss shotguns only seem to have any chance of hitting if the target is a few yards away, anything that get close I simple shoot through them with no damage.
---
I got the poison resistance perk, now everything but gutsy are a joke again lol.
---
Thank you, slightly upset that you can't get the plans for the rest of those legendaries but I hope Bethesda continue with bringing these plans into new content.
---
It does!  It says on the loading screen that they're people trapped in their suits!  We learn so much about their personal lives, we've even heard their voices on holotapes from before they were mutated!  It's exactly the same as eating ghouls!
---
I feel you, man. I'm now afraid of Mama Dolche
---
10 caps for a legendary. No thanks
---
That‚Äôs what the paper bags are for üòâ
---
Lmfao hoard. Love that auto correct
---
They‚Äôre still the most desirable things out there.
---
The problem ia that most of the times, seems I match up with half brained primates.
---
Nice time, congrats
---
Please for the love of god, no. I hate the stupid daily photo mission but I have to do it everyday to get scrip. Adding more to that will literally make me suicidal.
---
Welcome to Fortnight 76....
---
You find it 5 weeks ago in the last run.  99% chance you won't be able to get it.
---
Wow I never saw that event and I play every day.
---
And for what? Sweetwater tea? Jesus wept
---
This has definitely happened in the past (with plenty of evidence around) and could be happening again.
---
Apparently Mortimer at the Crater sells it for 1250 gold bullions, which you might not have access to yet if you just started.
---
You ain't missing much honestly, conversion ratios are at robbery levels. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You can purchase it from Gold Bullion vendors I believe. Not sure if all of them or only Regs in Vault 79, wouldn‚Äôt hurt to check them all though.
---
Mk
---
Ooh! Don‚Äôt mind if I do!
---
I believe it's being added as a gold bouillon item, along with chicken coop and maybe some other things from S1
---
Go to the very end of the build menu it should be there if you unlocked it. If not you gotta finish the wastelanders questline to unlock the gold grind to get it
---
No flannel clothes but YES to marine armor Plans - super sweet!
---
Lmao exactly the same just happened to me.
---
you need to be friendly (reputationwise) with the raiders, then you can buy it from mortimer, the gutsy vendor next to Meg, for 1250 gold bullion.  
---
i think it was in the atom shop also but dont know if its still.
---
You use chemist backpack. Thats a no brainer. Only other viable BP is the grocer one for melee. But if you are melee, you have bigger problems than a backpack
---
Apparently you can now buy it in foundation or crater vendors, but it costs a fair bit of bullion
---

---
This is what I‚Äôm currently using. Mixed in demolition expert recently. Land mines have become a staple for me. Something gets too close I back off and they go boom. Overall the build may not be 100% optimized but it works. 
---
Normal weapons I use are instigating lever, two shot gauss pistol. And back rifles are furious laser rifle, two shot gauss, and quad .50 cal hunting rifle. 
---
Chameleon armour with some vanguards will be your best armour choice for stealth. Or if your feeling brave get a full set of 3 star wooden shrouded armour for maximum sneak. Or a fixer. Both offer the same in term of raw effect.
---
There are some mods for the camera. I got one that lets me zoom way in.
---
Use R1 or RB to scroll the featured tab across to the Leaving Soon tab when you first enter the Atom Shop.
---
Really, since daily ops I'm rolling in more legendaries than I know what to do with
---
You still need more levels for legendary perks
---
West Tek approximately range from 0 to 5 legendaries, it's just random.
---
it's a dlc, similar to the settlers and raiders pack. gotta buy it directly from Bethesda.
---
or however is that you do it on console.
---
Just saying BoS gonna turn into pos if they ice him....
---
Keep playing, way to much game time wasted just for a joke if u retire him imo.
---
It's considered a DLC item, you need to buy it from the store (E.G Steam) you're using.
---
It not OP at all because with that mutation your basically fillin the tank role if anything it should be more HP+
---
And benevolent!
---
I wish I would of gotten to try it. No fun.
---
dang, i run pa full time and never get lucky enough to find a vendor like yours. 100-150 caps every time
---
So what do I do with all the ammo I'm not using?
---
The Overseer is a synth if there was ever any.
---
Magic was updayed to be not working anymore and legacy weapons do not drop anymore so they dont do anything about them. I understand those parts but not items that release that were never teated.
---
Camo glitch ? Hmmm I‚Äôve never heard of it. And I‚Äôll probably go with the protocols then
---
if you look at the current response "it feels fine for me!", they are ALL using heavy or commando build.  for semi auto builds or melee, game is broken because bethesda over-nerfed the damage.  take it from me, i have toons with ALL those builds, i see both sides of the coin.  my commando and heavy is nerfed but can compensate with high fire rate.  melee and semi weapons need to hit alot harder but post patch22, their dmg is just too low.
---
I was a lincoln log person myself.
---
Interesting, my brother and I play and he got the opp that it was there but enemies cloak when not attacking, then when he looked again it was the exploding one. We got initiate, I still don't have good enough sets of stuff for this character, plus it's mainly melee which is not fun in an exploding enemies map.
---
Oh yea and the cash register and cigarette machine
---
I know is bad comparing games, but I always loved Diablo 3's system.
---
You had Rifts, what was basically an easy and a quick way to level up and gear your toons. Could have some difficulty at the beggining, but Rifts were mostly a way to kill trash mobs for fun without having to think much about it or "tryhard".
---
And then you had Greater Rifts, which was the highest challenge of all the game. Was practically infinite, so you always had a reason to grind better and better gear, and most importantly, grinding had a purpose.
---
There's was a great symbiosis between those 2 modes. You want to do Greater Rifts? Go do some Rifts and get some decent gear first. But you couldn't be doing Rifts forever, if you wanted to progress and get the best gear you also needed to do Greater Rifts, so there was always this mix of grinding, killing trash mobs for fun and challenge yourself.
---
Translating that to 76, Rifts could be the world and Greater Rifts endgame activities like Daily Ops. And believe me, I'm the first one who wants endgame stuff. I have 3000 hours in this game, of course I want a challenge, but West Tek (or any other place you want to think of) shouldn't be a challenge. The world shouldn't be a thing that requieres "the best of you", it should be a place where you can have fun killing trash mobs, and then, if I wanted a real challenge, then I'd search for it, but again, the world isn't the place for it.
---
You can put it on your vendor machine for 1 cap a piece, some sell, some don't... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It almost looks like he's the last living survivor of a mass battle üòÇ
---
Equip Gunsmith and Lucky Strike for explosive weapons. Then change back to Demolition Expert and Bloody Mess if you need more damage at any point
---
It's almost as if the value matches the worth of it.
---
I agree with you so much but it wouldn‚Äôt fit the fallout lore/world 
---
But there is workaround like for tank role it could be a power armor limb mods 
---
And for healer it could be a robot healer or station they spawn Like a pet class healer in regular mmorpg 
---
But overall the game definitely need gearset benefits to work best
---
Of course. You need to remember: bloodied was nerfed, buy Unyielding still reigns supreme. 
---
I kept the same armor, just replaced the weapon and a couple of perks.
---
It happens to me near my camp if I load in behind a rock texture. I can walk through it but all the surface textures disappear
---
Do you aim for headshots, or try sneak attacks?
---
Anti-Armor and twoshot are definitely back on the menu, and are pretty close to the top of the tier list.  One thing though, unless it was fixed in the same hotfix as adrenaline, Demo Expert currently does nothing for explosive legendary effects.  I haven't tested, it may be fixed, but when I tested at the start of patch22 it didn't work.  You'd have to try it and let me know if it works or not, but I dropped it from my perks entirely to get more luck.
---
Counterpoint: low level areas were more of a grind because the xp and loot rewards weren't worth the time or ammo investment.
---
i like it. i collect all the ammo and people are dropping them everywhere. also, some sell missiles at 1c each. sitting on 50k ammo points now and if someone wants 8k fuel to sweeten a trade, i can just pick it up. the menu is still quite lousy but its at least useable now.
---
It's in steam
---
And then add Critical on top of that. I run around with a lvl 45 10mm Pistol wrecking shit
---
Sounds like you should nuke their camp.
---
You stated the very reason on your post
---
Except it doesn't. 40 scrip for a three star garbage roll is worth much more than 12 caps. I can easily hit vendor cap limit without getting rid of legendaries, and that's such a dumb way to get rid of them.
---
It used to be leaded with chemist as backup but now that 22 has dropped I need more stimpaks so it‚Äôs chemist all the time .
---
They drop ultracite rounds during the ops too?
---
I use it because if you don't you are at such a disadvantage not to mention a lot of loot boxes spawn on top of buildings. But I agree it's stupid because every fight is people just jumping up and down while shooting.
---
Good to know, glad I didn‚Äôt waste a trade. I‚Äôve got a TSE handmade I can test it out on.
---
Westek numba 1
---
Light it up
---
Stick it underground and use the mat glitch to get it wired up.
---
Are all of the daily ops going to be in the same 3 places?
---
Blood eagles or blue ridge caravan. That or the firebreathers
---
Not Atom Shop. Real money.
---
Thanks! That was driving me absolutely insane the other day!
---
Congratulations bud, 5 more levels for me before I can take this magical picture lol almost 2 years myself too!
---
Dont listen to that. Nuked flora is important too. But make sure to google the best spots to nuke for flora. You could be getting more than you currently are.
---
You don't really need that much DR, apparently there are diminishing returns from around 300, so 500 or even 400 should be plenty. Then you have stuff like Serendipity, Dodgy, Ricochet or Nerd Rage to save you if you get low on hp
---
I would love to see a moth man quest line where you help him kill the cultists because they hurt random people for no reason but this could be another event or repeatable quest
---
I‚Äôve noticed that I can‚Äôt find legendaries anywhere that hasn‚Äôt been nuked
---
I‚Äôm guessing they probably will at some point - but they can only build so much content at a time - right now they are working on brotherhood stuff...
---
It has some usefulness for sure, but I wouldn't spend 1250 gold for it personally.
---
I just use it to dump ammo that will never sell. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No they shouldn't. Its a team based event. Join a team.
---
Pretty sure Bloodied is still the best build even with the nerf
---
OP is talking about the weekly score task I believe.  I‚Äôm having a hard time finding enemies as well
---
Yup I was using my Ultracite .50cal and it was dropping ammo for it, But not for my ultracite Plasma Gat as that would be OP.
---
For me, i've been finding a lot more legendaries all around the map than normal. Just rng I think
---
This. Everything should update at the same time Challenges update.
---
Damn! I thought my 7:50 was too close yesterday. Nice work!
---
As I see it, this game was intended to be a survival lite game.   You were supposed to have to be constantly going out for supplies to survive.  If you can just wander around and collect supplies with little threat, that‚Äôs not much of survival.  
---
Making the enemies harder/more spongy didn‚Äôt make it into an endgame activity.  It made it the activity it was supposed to be from the get go.  Our end game activities are still Dropping Nukes, Killing Scorch Beast Queen, Killing the Colossus.  Yes we are lacking end game stuff still.  This change just made exploring the world at least a little more challenging (or very challenging, depending one‚Äôs ability to figure things out)
---
This, me and my buddy set up and stay on daily of teams for an entire session and whenever a random jumps in and starts the daily op we jump in and help them get elder.
---
I have yet to earn a reward from any of the rare lists.  Sure has been fun these last twenty attempts.  On a bright spot I‚Äôve altered my toon build where I never die during a Ops.  Feels like I‚Äôm flipping a bird to the devs
---
If you put camo paint on the t65 arm you can put the jetpack mod on it, which isn't intended as its actually a chest mod. Now I think about it I would say its more a bug than a glitch
---
I deleted my ally (not store) and rebuilt the item and it sorted it out for me.
---
Yes! And why can‚Äôt we just sell them at a vendor?
---
Go to the site, then support, choose your plattform, Atom Shop issues and log the ticket. I've had good experiences with them
---
Okay Thankyou hopefully that works
---
Crazy cus I just bought the camo paint last night! It had 2 days left on it.
---
I don‚Äôt know how, but I‚Äôm getting horror vibes from this. Time for the tracking computer missile launcher.
---
Don't change the paint after though as you lose the mod
---
Concentrated fire got a huge nerf
---
Nope, never fixed.
---
If it has been in games, since i last remember in Modern Warfare 2, it can be in a modern game. Duel wielding was in the Elder Scrolls with melee weapons and spells, so why not here?
---
If you have more cursed weapons for scrip than you can ever hope to use up a 3 star legendary is absolutely worthless. The point is that when you have too many legendaries you can either drop them or sell them.
---
I hope it works!
---
I would say it won't. The level 99 fireplace door didn't come back.
---
&gt; Also, avoid jumping back down right as he is about to die because the rocks will spawn around you as you are falling down the shaft and it makes you go splat.
---
No, don't avoid it, because if he's not yet dead that's the only time that pit is save to drop down to. When he's dead the bottom is insta-death.
---
Or maybe he thought, *‚ÄôWell, since no one else is on mic, I‚Äôll be considerate and turn mine off for right now, to avoid being distracting to others.‚Äô*
---
Do it as soon as because once that sale finishes they will fix it XD great way to get people spending atoms though
---
I got it thanks:)
---
A build doesn't mean that you need the full meta. I made a guerilla auto 10mm pistol build and it's shredding. Damage is not related to armor either, even tho Unyielding gives you Sneak without needing the Sneak perks
---
I can usually handle one or two on their own, its just when the uplink finishes and you have to rush to the next area, then turn the corner and BOOM, 5 mister gutsy's are there to give you a good old fashioned 21 gun salute and send you on your way to flavor town, that, that is what annoys me.
---
Only if you‚Äôre trying to earn, not if you‚Äôre trying to knock off season pass challenges or just playing the odd quest.
---
My point is, I‚Äôd prefer the option to have easy and hard enemies, not all enemies being hard enemies.
---
Either way, I‚Äôve booted it back up and I‚Äôm trying to respec and make it work.
---
Has relogging helped at all? If not I would definitely submit a ticket. I'm sorry you're having this issue and I hope you can resolve it quickly.
---
All the non hung over people took everything. Dicks.
---
They should be a spending limit a day say 1000 scrip but you can scrap as many as you want for scrip that way can get rid of our weight but there's still limit on what you can soend.
---
Sadly didn‚Äôt work
---
What if I told you it‚Äôs a game, fuck them, do what you want, screw them and JUMP servers.
---
It really does.
---
I doubt it. I believe they said only items that are classed as utility will be purchasable for GB. I guess that could change in the future but keep in mind none of the cosmetic stuff from season 1 is available.
---
"We've also raised the cap limit to 1500. Hope it helps :-*"
---
The daily level up challenge takes longer if you're only.killing 50xp enemies
---
Had a dude named SoWhatImToxic one shot me at a lead workshop and I couldn't hit him whatsoever, so that was fun. You get basement dwellers in this game unfortunately, lol.
---
Be a rebel. Nuke the silo
---
It‚Äôs exploding super mutants super easy
---
I got 8 min 1 second but I still got the rewards
---
Happens 100% if the time for me now
---
Not me!! üëçüëç
---
Buy stuff idk wtf u talking about a 30,000 caps limit is a kids game have you played any other online game? 
---
All the crap in the atom shop and scoreboard yea there would be a lot to keep buying and you would be able to cus it‚Äôs very easy already to hit caps limit in a few transactions. 
---
ALL rare items are worth more than the caps limit. If you find getting caps hard in this game you must be new.
---
&gt;While it was unfortunate, it's my own fault for not managing my caps. From now on I'm keeping myself at 20k tops.
---
Kudos for being willing to adapt to the situation instead of dwelling on the negative past experience.
---
I can‚Äôt believe there are people actually playing this game.
---
Just use someone elses
---
Bethesda completely changed their vision of what this game was supposed to be because of idiots like this guy. The game was supposed to be a multiplayer sandbox in the Fallout universe, there is nothing else like that out there. Now you have a glorified single playerish game with no conflict, no challenge and no vision. Now this is just another game people will stop playing in a year or 2 after people like this gobble the themepark content and move on to a new game to ruin.
---
Do I need that much DR?  No.  Do I want that much DR?  No, I want more.  **MORE!**  But real talk, once you break 500 you start to feel fairly significant benefits again.  I have tested with 300 and my nearly 700 and the difference is actually quite large.  But that's not the point, I want to have the most DR possible without PA, for probably the same reason people want the most damage possible.
---
There's a big grace period before the rads start hurting you. You can easily fast travel away in that time, or pop your rad chems
---
Or my emergency protocols, the ultimate tank mod.
---
If the game can't handle scattershots, they should give us an option to mod our shotguns so we can fire slugs or dragonbreaths or something
---
Actually, don‚Äôt. There are plenty of GamePass pricks who like to grief low levels and take and dismantle their workshops just because they can. Had it happen to me many times after I got wiped, but I hunted them down the second I hit 58 and got a BE laser rifle. They regretted picking on me after that, I can guarantee it.
---
Honestly? Since it was your team, I would have just kicked him. Let someone else who wanted to do the Op join.
---
Happens with flamer too I noticed today.
---
I think you answered your own question.
---
I don‚Äôt use healing factor, so idk what else it could be
---
There wasnt one at all. I stepped out the door and before the loading screen finished i heard the death tone noise thingy
---
You can. You just shouldn‚Äôt if you want to avoid lost caps. 
---
My advice is to buy things. Spend 6000 with Smiley. Buy ammo from low level players. Purchase serum recipes. If you have FO1st, buy scrap and store it. 
---
I have about 8000 Black Titanium, for example, probably most of which I bought from player camps. If it‚Äôs reasonably priced (50% or less of Base Value), then I‚Äôll usually by some.
---
Sorry about that! Lame that this is happening to you. 
---
Could you try scrapping the ally, restarting your game, then replace it? I have no idea if that would help but I thought I'd offer something to try. Best of luck! 
---
Edit: You may want to send Bethesda a ticket if it persists and see if they can suggest a fix from their end.
---
Who said that part was a downside?
---
Ok gotcha! Thanks I thought it was a glitch of some sort
---
Do those still exist or did they make them unobtainable after the previous problems?
---
My only complaint is how much each railway spike weighs. Five railway spikes weighs the same as 200x 5.56 rounds which despite the penetration and sheer damage is fucking ridiculous or I‚Äôd use my BE rail more often. I also don‚Äôt like the recoil - definitely a VATS gun.
---
Legendary Poodlehamster is in the next patch.
---
Yeah, I guess, but all the other challenges you could do easily with low level enemies, then I may level up doing those, and then go against higher level enemies to top up.
---
Same difficulty probably, but you can earn bullion on your own time.
---
Grenades can be helpful if your below level 50, for helping deal with high level foes (before One Wasteland, at least), but after that they quickly become useless.
---
Worst I get is people in pacifist punching endlessly and not stopping, can‚Äôt hurt them back cause they‚Äôre in pacifist. Happens occasionally but not to much
---
I agree probably this, its not that fun talking to people and not getting replies and only emotes.
---
Wait. WHAT? My rank 5 demo expert is doing *nothing?* Fuck sakes Bethesda... Can these pricks not do *anything* right?
---
Thankyou for the help means a lot
---
20 bucks? Think I‚Äôll pass
---
It‚Äôs because each pellet hits. Before they wouldn‚Äôt.
---
My wife threatened to leave me if I didn‚Äôt stop forgetting to call out the supervisor location at Uranium Fever so she could tag it.
---
So then we switched areas and she accidentally one shot it then understood how that can happen. 
---
One Wasteland with the scaled up enemies (making it easier to avoid one-shorting them) may have saved our marriage!
---
It has the lowest vats cost in the game, with my 25% vats cost reduction I actually gain AP while shooting it.  Definitely a VATS gun.  Bandolier makes it tolerable for me, since I'm running strength for barbarian anyway, but I could see how that's a problem if you don't have it in your build.  At least for it's weight, it's also cheap.  *Just* steel.
---
Boisterous Belch, the gassiest most aboxious booze ever made!
---
Especially that far into the board. It‚Äôs a disappointment to hit.
---
Could they just use someone else‚Äôs if they‚Äôve left it outside?
---
New Vegas references upcoming then !?!?
---
Nice, good to see they took latency into consideration when it comes to those last 30 seconds. Maybe it‚Äôs unintentional... either way, it just works...
---
Would sorta invalidate the legendary perk, so I doubt it
---
Again, may have been fixed in the same hotfix that made Adrenaline work again.  You'd have to test with it on and off to know for sure.  If you get a definitive answer please report back, I don't want to spread misinformation.
---
7 steel for 5 spikes... Costly. My build simply doesn‚Äôt have room for bandolier.
---
REEE I CANT AIM SLIGHTLY UP NERF FROG LEGS BETHESDA OMG
---
There was a previous dev post saying they are moving daily ops to 12 est with everything else. It would be nice to have some uniformity.
---
Him gots good blood deed vamp wire rye full.
---
Agree.  There should be noob areas and developed character areas.
---
West Tek is so random for me. I usually only get one... I just use it for the steel and free gunpowder at this point. The legendary is a nice bonus.
---
My main char is level 420 as well lol
---
I always run Rank 5. So I‚Äôll kill 3 level 100 Yao Guais with it off, and 3 with it on and average the number of rounds it took to kill them. If I want to have a *truly* scientific experiment then I would need to gather more results in order to determine statistical significance like I learned in A-Level biology and medical science.
---
i love getting wasted and waking up in places i don‚Äôt remember
---
Yes it is. I have 2 uny/sent SS pieces. I have also crafted hundreds, spent all my scrip since wastelanders hit for armor pieces.
---
Responders. My camp will forever be a mobile fire breather base

Nah people still buy em. The nerf wasn‚Äôt so detrimental that it broke the build.

Youre making assumptions, im just saying what u gon do with 250k caps when theres no caps sink after u get all the weapons u wanted

Understandable.  I'm sure you make up for the damage in other ways, it was more just a suggestion for high health builds that are struggling a bit.  I'm built entirely as a healer tank so I lean on the railway rifle and crit perks for the bulk of my damage.  It's a game of compromise, really, but it works out for me.
---
Thank you for the understanding :) I have no problem changing my building with a commando bloodied, but I roleplayed a hunter, I started that way using all my perk points to get the bow perks and now I have to change everything.
---
I do it for elder then bail

Damn thats lucky. I wish you could select your wished legendary effects and Luck would give you a slight chance in getting that. Actually, that wiuld be a nice Legendary perk.

They can't fix VATS that much is clear by now, for whatever reason. They just have to keep rolling onward regardless of any bugs left in their wake.
---
3 stars sell out quick on vendor for 350.  If you need or want caps.  If you dont, stash them to scrap another day or just trash um.
---
I saw this the other day on an acid run (hey don't judge) and thought maybe I was just remembering wrong. There's a moving truck out back too. Pretty cool to confirm I wasn't mistaken and that the world can evolve like this. Makes exploring so much more interesting when things change.
---
That is one of the major downsides to the game now a days. You used to be able to run into low level enemy spawns and pick up the loot there without draining your weapon and armor durability, not to mention saving on ammo (if you use guns, that is). The only real upside to having enemies scaling with your level is that you get TONS more XP from kills to "weaker" enemies. As for the Ballistic Fibers, I would personally try going to Camp Mcclintock and picking up any Military Ammo Pouches you find there (its not the best but its still kinda protected from enemies...), or just go to robot venders and see if they have some bulk ballistic fibers for sale.
---
ALSO...
---
You might want to look into getting either the Fix it Good perk (130% durability when repairing armor, scaling to 160% and 200%) or getting the White Knight perk (armor breaks 20% more slowly and is cheaper to repair, scales to 40% and 60% slower degrading)
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Nuke where you want to buddy, I nuked toxic valley today as I needed 500 violet flux, there was a nuke zone on ACP which still procced too but no one went to it.
---
I got rid of my pa. I still rarely see pa, except for robots. I see a lot there. I almost break mine out, but my armor effects...
---
I just wear my excavator set for the carry weight lol...
---
Never.  I hate it.  Have never worn any for any extended period in any fo game.
---
Chances are if they're happy missing out on elder they've already done it for the day and are literally just farming resources.
---
It's a dick move, but it is the likely reasoning.
---
Try selling them in your vendor for 15c per scrip value. There are some people that don‚Äôt end up with a lot of legendaries for one reason or another and would be glad to just buy them and hit their own daily 150 and move on. 
---
One of my friends logs on during the week just long enough to sell 1400c worth to vendorbots, scrip 150 worth of legendaries and turn in 20 Treasury notes (he‚Äôs sitting on a few hundred thanks to Fasnacht and Meat Week). Does the easy dailies if he can.  Then he logs off. On the weekends is when he can usually play.
---
I can confirm Radiation Rumble got heavily nerfed. Before patch it‚Äôs usually 4ish level 40 legendary ghouls throughout the whole 8 minute session. After patch it‚Äôs been zero to one, and the one is only one star. Done this five times, all same thing. I guess they nerfed it because now they‚Äôll drop max level stuff. 
---
So if you‚Äôre after legendary farming, it‚Äôs definitely not worth it for the ammo and time you‚Äôll be wasting. Do it only when you want some XP or as a team to farm the barrel plan and hazmat suite.
---
At least it doesn‚Äôt auto-correct to whore like my phone does. Maybe I should stop calling my buddy a whore.
---
?  Are you serious?  They are jumping so fast and so high so aiming at them is pretty damn difficult. Especially when using gamepad.
---
You‚Äôll be able to use *better* Power Armor parts when you hit level 25. You can still use the Raider parts if you choose.
---
They are trying to encourage group play.  Just join a public group it's completely painless.
---
Gusty... pfft. Assaultrons face blasts are the bane of my existence.
---
Why are you getting downvoted? I've wanted to nuke a player's camp for much less.
---
Stick by the uplink.
---
This deserves everyone‚Äôs up vote.
---
I already have all the weapons I want. If you over level 200 and you don‚Äôt have 2-3 good ones Idk what else to say. 
---
There will always be a caps sink if they always have vendors. I don‚Äôt see your point in not having more available money to actually buy things in game instead of relying on outside sources from the game. 
---
Maybe your point is to not have a point. I‚Äôm arguing for a solution that would actually fix the issue this topic brought up.
---
I love coming around a corner to a instant death beam.
---
I agree. I have been noticing this in VATS as well.
---
I've had to start selling them for caps
---
So what u gon buy then, must be a hard question for you to awnser
---
Tweaks are needed.
---
With legendary perks now out I'm regretting running 3 alts. It's going to take forever to get one of them to lvl 300
---
Chemist. Stimpaks and psychotats weigh a lot.
---
10/10
---
I disagree. It was designed as a team event that is more challenging if run solo.  That‚Äôs the purpose.
---
Lots of us are running it solo under 8 minutes. Sometimes it might take a few tries. Last night I made a misstep on my first solo run and wasn‚Äôt in a good position for the boss. Ended it at 8:45. 
---
The next run I shaved almost 40 seconds off. Third time was the charm at 7:40.
---
Maneuverability and tactics are the key. Use cover when needed while defending Alpha &amp; Bravo. Be quick and dodgy when moving to the next area. Don‚Äôt get bogged down in fights. Focus on the objective. Run past enemies if needed. 
---
Remember what you‚Äôre there for and you‚Äôll improve your time.

I usually stick by the link. Yesterday with the freezing robots was rough for melee, I had to use my big gun
---
Aargh!
---
Frog legs jumps have diminishing return which a lot of people who complain about it don‚Äôt realize. After your 3rd jump you‚Äôre jumping lower than if you didn‚Äôt have frog legs (pretty much not at all)
---
Yes I am serious. This is literally a git gud situation.
---
I use next to no damage perks save for Bloody Mess. Next to all my perks are QoL and I often times have no issues with. The solution, least in my eyes, is just finding a decent weapon that can help you out in a fight.
---
I don‚Äôt play anymore sorry
---
I think I've only ever found a legendary once at West Tek haha. It's like a joke with myself whenever I see people talk about the location to farm legendaries. On the whole I think the opposite, I think there's more legendaries now with the higher levels in general.
---
Why did you remove it?
---
I do daily ops shortly after it resets, so everyone likely focuses on getting elder rank.
---
There is no difference for low level players.
---
Have you tried moving to another server?  I have found the 76 community to be one of the best I've ever seen outside of the service (Army)... seriously. Hopefully you have just had some bad luck or maybe there's another element that you missed, such as you nuked someone's objective or camp.  But also, I guess it just happens too. I mean if you get to nuke wherever you want, so can they.
---
Edit: I have never nuked so know nothing about the etiquette
---
use a gun and shoot things if youre gonna sit there. maybe something with 90% reduced weight.
---
Keep scrapping and upgrading and have a melee weapon on you for when you run out of ammo or stuff breaks.
---
Can confirm, I‚Äôve been playing from dawn to dusk since I got the game and have ~600 hours; I just got the game like a month and change ago
---
Stuff glitched into other structures and altered my CAMP budget. Kinda got salty for a bit lol but realized one of the things I enjoy is making CAMPs and this seems to happen to all my CAMPs eventually so when it does now I just move on and try something new. I may make it again though.
---
No, it's more common than you think, I had it on my very first solo nuke as well
---
That‚Äôs been my thoughts so far, but I feel less than useful. I‚Äôm always free to revive, but have no revive perks. I guess I could embrace a paladin style build, meshing a heavy weapon/healer. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs really any synergy in that though.
---
Reading do you do it? Scoreboard and atom shop items ? They could easily remove the caps limit and those items could be bought for caps as an option. Many games use duel currencies like that premium and not. They could then monetize caps bundles for atoms just like they will for repair and scrap kits 
---
Also armor you can buy that too and fashion. That‚Äôs the true end game. And none of what‚Äôs good is attainable without rng drops or trade.
---
I use unarmed with blocker, serendipity, and born survivor and almost never go down, I hated dodgy cause of needing the ap to rip and tear, I have hack&amp;slash at 20% and mow weak groups quickly
---
Exactly, my main is lvl 317 with his build completed 15 weapins on me, half i dont even use, all top tier, basically know all the plans i need to know for crafting and C.a.m.p.ing im sitting on 257 ultracite fusion cores and 200 stimpacks and 250 flux. So wtf do i need with for instance a cap limit of 200k. The f am i gonna buy?
---
I stuck with melee weapons until I managed to get a plan for the handmade rifle at the prison just north of the airport (it‚Äôs a random reward from the event Patrol Duty that spawns there) and then built my play style around that. The plan let‚Äôs you craft a better version every 10 levels. I‚Äôd also keep an eye out for horde events or the leader of the pack event at the top left of the map as it spawns 3 low level legendary enemies, and see if you can get yourself a good starter legendary. Unfortunately I did all this before the one wasteland update and the consensus is the game is a bit tougher for lower levels, but hopefully doing these events alongside the other main and side quests will help you net a weapon that will help!
---
If you follow the overseers log it should send you everywhere from to start to nuke.   Plenty of other main quests and sides to do. Scrap is just everywhere depending on console there is a way to pin point what scrap is in what junk.
---
*Or* they could fix the problem with Explosive Bait...
---
You have 5,465 shotgun shells. It's an ammo counter. You can verify this by looking at your ammo tab.

If your on ps4 I can help I'm waiting for my daily ops to reset
---
You need someone that can install those on Xbox?
---
you mean... the amount of ammo you have...?
---
They are the most biggest fukn nuisance in the game! I remember my first time ever exploring a nuke zone alone (it was in the Scorched Earth area), and I happened to hear the delighted voice saying "Is that someone who needs their ass kicked?!" Next thing I know, I'm surrounded by these fukrs and tearing through my Stimpaks. In the end, I went through around 25 diluted Stimpaks and around 1250 (roughly) .50 rounds just to kill 3!!!! Hell, I would take on 3 god damn Scorched beasts with a lvl 1 manchette than go up against those fukrs with a lvl 45 50 Cal Machine gun. I hope they burn in hell, those commie fukrs &gt;:(
---
Trust me, you are not running out of quests at level 17. You haven‚Äôt even started Wastelanders. When you get to level 20 go talk to the overseer and she‚Äôll introduce you to the two main factions.
---
What platform? I can install those on Xbox.
---
Somerset special n a melee wep
---
Thats how much of that ammo you're carrying
---
Tick Blood. Treasury Notes. Legendary reward (which might be new, because I received one from the event and I don‚Äôt recall that before).
---
Yea dream on buddy, were talking bout fallout 76 here and bethesda who dont even sell the bundle items individually in the atom shop
---
Can we not complain about this please
---
Honestly if you did this right it could be a great way of storing extra caps.
---
Ya know it's not a bad thing to take a break from something if it's stale...
---
I tried solo my second time and I died an insane amount of times in power armor on the final boss. got him after a long time though.

---
Two nights ago, I had an albino one spawn next to my survival tent and run in and get stuck in it. Called my gf in for backup, and after a few deaths, and blowing all our available ammunition, we managed to hack it to death.
---
I'm a shotgun main so I had a similar issue, what i've started doing is bringing along a heavy weapon (as they also use strength perks) and using that.
---
It's a barrier to entry and or a perk of having played for a little bit. Should they also take out damage perks because getting shot twice and dieing is stupid when it takes you a whole clip to kill someone? Should they take out pharmafarma because it's bs the guy you just shot hid behind a corner and stimmed? Take perks like this out and it's one step closer to a homogenized -every other battle royal game-.
---
I can find steel and wood just fine, its damn aluminum that's the issue lol
---
I know how you feel. I had to remove my camp because I accidentally moved something underground using stairs and couldn‚Äôt delete it. Luckily I was able to rebuild my camp exactly the way it was before though.
---
Make it ammo credits and make all the train station machines take it. For that matter just use those damn machines for exchange.
---
Yes. Also I've been wanting to test it with my cousin but if you have a friend there's a chance they might be able to build it on your camp for you
---
Aluminium cans. You can get tin ones but yeah just google some spots
---
Newer player here. How do you reach your Limit so quickly? Looking for some tips thanks!
---
Actually, I find an increase in their numbers. I've just done One Violent Night, at least 3 of the ghouls were legendary (that I noriced), plus the wendigo of course.
---
This game tried to be a lot of things, and sadly, failed at most of them. Tries to please survival players with crafting and a few survival touches here and there, but at the end crafting is pretty much irrelevant, needs are more of a nuisance than anything else, building has ever had any use besides the aesthetics... and... we better don't talk about PvP. 
---
Also tries to please looter shooter players, when there's plenty of looter shooter games out there that do it 1000 times better than 76. Basically because those games had clear they wanted to be looter shooters since the beginning.
---
This game maybe was intented to be a lite survival game at some point, but the games evolve as their playerbase grow and how their perceive the game. Right now this game is more of a looter shooter than anything else, or at least the majority of the people who still plays this game 2 years after its release does it for it's looting component, but we are still stucked on these prehistoric mechanics which maybe were ok for a 2010 game, but aren't for a 2020 game (it's terrible RNG and how unfriendly is everything with the player, lack of endgame content, their inability to make more than one build viable or interesting... this could be perfectly another post, but this message is already too long and I don't want to make a book of this).
---
Drinking vintage nukashine is fun too.
---
Why not keep your old play station and use it for fo76?
---
If you don‚Äôt actually know what that means then this is the funniest thing I have ever read on this sub lol.
---
It‚Äôs rarely an issue for me.
---
you might want to read sub rules
---
Trading is not allowed here. See rule 10
---
Got to r. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 without all the periods for your trading needs
---
Technicaly you dont drop them Buth they get destroyed, well suppose result is the same, with the rep they have nobody is eager to pick Them up.
---
The next pos repaint they put out..idk. 
---
I see your point 
---
I think what they have available right now won‚Äôt appeal to anyone who‚Äôs been playing for a while. Being able to buy stuff only works in a game economy where you can do stuff with that currency. Right now what we expect from the game is more than what‚Äôs actually there. 
---
 so I actually agree with you the options of what‚Äôs out there aren‚Äôt worth having a enough caps for it cus nothing in this game really is worth that much. Just the essence of how lame it becomes once you get everything you need.
---

this aint a trading sub. good luck getting that legacy.
---
The market place is still flooded with them, I‚Äôve seen a few in player vendors.. I seem to remember they were the must have from launch, then nerfed and dropped off the wanted list..
---
Yep! Last patch it I generally would find on average 3-4 legendary enemies. The loot itself was usually trash but helped with completing daily challenges of killing legendaries.
---
As a melee, this patch I‚Äôve actually been using vats for the first time thanks to the legendary hack n slash perk
---
This is the most bipolar post ive ever seen lol. I did the switch to pc. Still love it.

The biggest thing is to stick by the up link and don't die. Everything else is extra

My friends are moving to Xbox and I play with them, so I‚Äôm switching to xbox, and I told my little brother (who doesn‚Äôt live with me) that wen I get a next gent console he could have the playstation.

(using a handmade, hope thats ok :D)
---
I don't suppose you happen to have an extra copy of the Fixer plans, do you dydamas?
---
Mayb because the game doesnt live up to the community's expectations looking at these simple things youre implying. its headed in the right direction but the obvious little things that couldv made this a great game are not there, a trade hub, higher caps stash limit, a real cap sink, less glitches for the dupers who ruined the economy in the first place and so on. Im still playing cant deny it. But my hopes arent all that high anymore.
---
i tend to put ones that will sell into my machines at a low-ish price (because otherwise they'll just sit around), scrip what i can, and dump the rest in the rusty pick.
---
Damn that's a hell of a lot to give up lol. I don't think I could do it, I love the game but have put so much time in to my gear lol
---
Good on you though!
---
I should throw grenades a *lot* more liberally than I do. I have this issue in most games which have grenades.
---
In a place that will get your account banned
---
I think it would make sense for the community to organize around getting character transfers with the transition to next gen consoles, what you described strikes me as something that shouldn‚Äôt be the case and Im sure plenty of people will be in your boat
---
Free wooby!

No and it's a guaranteed ban to visit that cell anyways.

It's up to you to switch console gens always go back and forth. Stick to what u like tho I will say if I'll my friends got PS I would as well. I always sat play where your friends are. You'll have a better time.
---
So all your friends are giving up their PS4 characters as well? Or did you never play with them on the same console in the first place?
---
Note that the vendor is the original vendor from harpers ferry, vendor bot wallace.
---
I found a location in the north of the map, crater Welch station, I believe that was an undiscovered location. It was just some raiders and a load zone into a tunnel that did not go anywhere. I was a little disappointed but hopefully it will become a cool location in the future.

I have actually made that one 3 times. It's not easy glitching the diner bar tables/ends around the porch from the classic house set from the atom shop. I say old CAMP because I moved on and won't do it a 4th time for now. I may in the future but for now I'm running a junk operation - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ivyq5m/i_dont_know_why_but_playing_this_game_as_a/
---
Yeah, it's actually pretty calming.
---
Yeah I have very mixed feelings about it. Part of me is a little upset that I have to restart, but another part is excited to play it all over again. I only have one character so I‚Äôve only played through the game once and I think it would be fun to do it again
---
Well when I do daily ops team I usually do like 10 daily ops. Bunch of materials ammo and legndarys and some times notes.

Why are there so few weapon skins in a military themed season?  How did that even get past the board room table phase of the planning?

Yeah I‚Äôm doing it for my friends mainly. The only advantage to playstation for me is the exclusives, and eventually (maybe next year or the year after that) I might get a playstation to play them.
---
Nobody uses them
---
Nice.  I squeaked by with 7:56 today.  The Burrows is definitely the hardest location to solo.
---
Probably, yeah. I‚Äôm excited to start over though‚Äî I wish that at the very least my atom purchases would carry over and fallout 1st
---
I have 500 notes and god I wish I could just cash them all in. Or at least 5000 gold worth, because there's a goddamn cap on that too.
---
are you seriously THIS dumb?
---
I‚Äôve put a ridiculous amount of time into this game. More so than almost any other game i‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôve only played through on one character though‚Äî so i think it will be exciting to go through it again on next gen!
---
Honestly sonys been doing alot of shady shit lately which kinda turned me off them. Xbox has been very consumer friendly recently, and gamepass is unreal. If your friends are going to xbox I would make the switch.
---
Speaking of the rad kits and med kits, what‚Äôs even in them or what do they do?
---
Thorn armor also can‚Äôt be mixed and matched with either.  It‚Äôs gonna be a long, long grind for that uny suit.
---
It is, especially when you havent got a main to give you all the shiz you want. The community helps though some real good high levels helped me with ammo and armour.
---
Just use an addictol.
---
I agree having so much more fun
---
Do you have the available camp budget open?
---
Yeah I'm 1.3k hours in, think the  closest I've gotten in another game was 300 or 400 hours haha
---
Buddy, you keep throwing away those legendaries for essentially nothing. I'm good on that
---
They‚Äôre giving up their PS4 characters! They haven‚Äôt played half as long as I have though‚Äî they haven‚Äôt even beat the main story‚Äî so their loss isn‚Äôt as great.
---
Rad-X‚Äôs and Radaway‚Äôs = RadKits

Down with the Brotherhood, they‚Äôre only gonna treat us like their bitch even though we took down the very things that drove them out.

This can work but if they have friends in the server they can leave and join back and now they know you‚Äôre targeting them and they might harass you or do the same to you

I just checked and I‚Äôve got an AA/E/lvc RR rifle to test

I shoot any missiles I pick up with it, just for fun, then scrap the launcher.

That's basically a god roll.  Nice pull!

Having to drop them right after is an unnecessary burden.
---
I'm not casual enough to need to save every single legendary I get but you do you.
---
Sell em for caps
---
Even if they reduce the scrip out put on three star weapons to 30 scrip a piece I'd be fine with that. Then you could turn in 5 three stars a day
---
Looks like all them nades gonna come in real handy.
---
That‚Äôs some pretty low effort in an attempt to spice up the rewards. And as if we didn‚Äôt have enough of those from the daily ops anyway.
---
It would be nice if they were scrappable for nuclear material, or if you didn't need an increment of 3 for the ammo converter.
---
Also, I lost 8k in ammo currency the other day because I was one selection up from the top "sell" option. Ammo vendor tree should be sell/buy &gt; type &gt; quantity, and I don't see a reason to break it down into category &gt; type. I thought you're able to have multi-page menus in terminals, but I could be mistaken. Isn't the PIP-Boy just another terminal interface?
---
I noticed Vats is severally bugged right now, 99% of my shots will hit the target using my handmade and now it seems like 70% of my shots hit and 30% of my vat shots fly all over the place lol something must have went wrong or they nerfed that too along with alot of other damage perks they nerfed.
---
I've got a few you can buy :P
---
That was only in the pts, though it might happen with the upcoming bombs drop event. Though we aren't sure what that really is
---
People do nuke it rather regularly though if you keep an eye out
---
Quality post.
---
Eh, I can repair my camp or if need be, let them destroy it, white springs has everything I need. As long as you make a note of where they are, you can block them and drop another nuke. Although, I haven't had the need to do this, so be careful of the outcome

Definitely. Plus (prepare for my IT tech nerd side that‚Äôs about to come out) the playstation 5 is using some sketchy technology that I don‚Äôt really trust. Xbox Series X delivers at max 12 Teraflops of power (most games will utilize at least 10 Teraflops consistently). The playstation 5 however is using new technology called smart shift, which is (sort of) like overclocking the cpu, expect its rapidly switching the processing load from the GPU to the CPU. So with that active, It has a max of 10 Teraflops processing power. The problem is that game developers don‚Äôt know how to utilize the smart shift. They‚Äôve even requested from sony a guide on how to use it with their games because of how complicated it is. So without utilizing that the ps5s processing power dropped to like 7 Teraflops. Now 10 for the Xbox Series X compared to the 7 for the Playstation 5 doesn‚Äôt sound like much‚Äî but here‚Äôs a reminder that that playstation 4 was only 1.8 Teraflops. That‚Äôs a huge difference. Alright nerd rant over‚Äî basically i‚Äôm switching for friends lol
---
That would also be fine.
---
You're quite welcome, glad I helped you.
---
Thanks for the reward/award if that was you üòÅ
---
Yeah when I saw your post, I suspected that to be the case. Is this really about FO76 for you? 
---
I'd reckon you will buy the new Xbox, get FO76 on it, and that's great. But what if a few months later your friends stop playing FO76? 
---
You would have quit your character for people who dont even play the game you love.
---
If I were in your situation, I'd probably get both the next gen PS and Xbox, as long as you know there will be other games on Xbox you will share with your friends once they stop playing FO76.
---
Yes, and it appears that it actually double activates, so worth to check back and redo the event.
---
fyi: clipboards give springs
---
It got to be a random encounter to tame. I have personally never found a fox that‚Äôs tame-able. You also have to be 3x higher level than it if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Also budget is a factor, they take about 10-ish %
---
I agree. Overall I think that Seasons Rewards could be much better. There‚Äôs too much low quality rewards suck as for example 50 Bullion, or 1000 Caps. You can get 4x more bullion every day
---
Been jumping servers for an hour, so I guess I will just wait for whatever this future event is.
---
No I was hoping when it got released on consoles that it would be like that. But most times I can find a server where 1 or 3 nukes get set off. Or I will go and set one off. Use to not really do it but before patch I was doing it every day. Wonder how tough the robots are now since patch.
---
This is really disappointing to hear that you have to start over on Series X.   Guess I won't be buying one.   There's no way on earth I can start over on the massive grind.   Especially with my new goal being to max out my Legendary Perk cards.
---
I try to get what I can on my own when possible. Gives me a sense of achievement. I have gone to purchase serums from high level players who just give them to me for free though
---
It‚Äôs happens to the best of us üí™
---
Yea true probably better to post on the trading sub.  Just gotta vent my anger a bit more because this is so toxic.
---
I always try for headshots first, if that fails i'm going for center mass, then i switch with the handmade gun to finish off whatever's hiding out of sight. That was pre update 22, this tactic almost gets me killed every time now. I just avoid fights because i don't want to die in fallout, its part of the fun for me as i'm a RP. Sniping stuff is breaking the immersion and i do not enjoy that, it feels tedious and artificial.
---
I put my extras next to the scrip machine. Feels like legendary items are not so legendary anymore.
---
Whatever one‚Äôs feelings on the survival side of the game, it‚Äôs still not good game design to have the same type of rewards available in easy low level zones as there was in the highest level.  A player could get all but the ultracite and fluxes just sitting around the forest.  
---
You‚Äôre right the game did try to do a lot, and it looks like the developers have now looked at Borderlands as their model for this game, and if you look at the most popular activities besides the hunting for legendary drops: Camp Building and Exploring, those two elements needed the game to become more challenging to make it worth while.  Online games have always been a horrible place for ‚Äúcasual players‚Äù 
---
this was to me, one of the best and most needed changes to the game‚Äôs base experience for it to continue.  Yes, a few tweaks are needed to smooth it out, but these concepts actually bring back some risk to the game, even just wandering around the wasteland, and actually make it feel like a dangerous world.
---
If you're on xbox be sure to check the lfg page. You can also probably pay someone to do it for you over on the trading sub
---
At least spill the beans, no names of course...
---
No sarcasm: What do you need more power for? Even when I was water farming I never hit the 100 from the normal reactor. Again, no sarcasm, genuine curiosity.
---
Yeah as far as I can tell (discussion forums, bethesda support, FAQs) NOTHING transfers over if you switch consoles. I was hoping at the very least the things I paid real money for would. But it‚Äôs alright‚Äî I just begin the grind anew
---
That might be it
---
Interesting with Concentrated fire x1, ground pounder x2.. better reload/hip fire.. instead of Cf x3.. 
---
I‚Äôll definitely try that üëçüèº
---
I‚Äôve never used Ricochet..
---
I wish we got vouchers for scrip. I now have 4 alts with 1000 weight on them and stash filled and my main has around 400 to 500 on them and 800 always in stash. I usually sell ones to vendors idk wish they did do something
---
But how can you be 3x higher if all things scale to you? Unless there is a random encounter with like chickens or something but how do I get a sloth at my camp if its gonna be my level
---
Kind of what I meant. Jump down there as he goes from 1 percent to 0 health and you end up dead and spawn outside.
---
If you can tell he will be dead by the time you hit the ground, then don't try to jump down there.
---
PC sadly, but doing okay. 2/4 characters complete so far.
---
Are you on PC by chance? Would be useful to have a pal who I can run all 4 of my characters with as opposed to chancing a new server each time.
---
I did get a bloodied 3 star vats I think fat man the other day. Idk if I wanna scrip it or just shoot that bad boy everywhere. But missile launchers I usually scrip right away
---
There is an existing open world aspect to the game that was just updated called "one wasteland", where you keep mentioning west tek, the origin of all of the super mutants in Appalachia, is too difficult with level 100 enemies.
---
I think you're fundamentally putting too much stock in levels. Two enemies can be level 100 and be different in terms of power. Enemies in west tek and enemies in an endgame challenge area can both be level 100 and still be manageable.
---
If there was anything I took away from the release of the outer worlds its that bethesda engine excels at creating an open world with a large variety of items scattered about.
---
I don't want the game to become like diablo. I don't want all of the content to be instanced. Rifts were a late addition after the game had broken gear progression and attempted to focus on RMT for gear.
---
I bought the game because I wanted an open world with danger in that world, not in hidden instanced scenarios while the world is just a peaceful cakewalk but I understand that bethesda games don't usually force survival mechanics on players and allow you to set the difficulty to very easy. This means a moderate difficulty level and food and water mechanics aren't going to be for everyone, but they needed to find some universal difficulty setting and I think they've done well.
---
No you will not get your weapon back
---
That's actually interesting advice. And your remark about charisma, that is part of a serious departure from the original fallout games. In those you could talk your way out of situations, but now fighting is generally the only solution. An unfortunate evolution, but what can you do.
---
No problemas for me.
---
I am the unluckiest. I haven‚Äôt gotten 1 rare drop yet.
---
Inb4 rare drops aren‚Äôt guaranteed, 80% doesn‚Äôt mean 4 out of 5 every time, etc.
---
I know that. But not getting one after 5 elder rank runs is asinine.
---
Yeah we play EVERYTHING together. I don‚Äôt see them quitting anytime soon tbh.. It‚Äôs almost a competition with them to see who can reach my level first üòÇ. But even if they do quit, I can only afford one or the other. I‚Äôll be getting a playstation next year probably, but I figure by then I‚Äôll have grinded my way back to where I was.
---
Most likely that's a animal that you cannot tame.not all animals can be tamed in the game
---
I don't think you can get them back through a ticket.   However, Facebook has a group of bounty hunters that might take care of him/her, especially since you have evidence.
---
Wait for them to go into the mine, so they may be too busy to notice where it drops, and even then they need to abandon and miss the event.
---
Found Todd lol
---
Yup, had this happen to me multiple times, and only after I finish Scorched Earth. Can't even focus while farming fluxes because of it
---
It's ridiculously low
---
You either press space when the Crit meter is full and your next shot is critical. Or you hold space to chain them (typically used commando builds)
---
I can‚Äôt wait to get back to the point where I can get legendary perks! I look at it as both a blessing and a curse tho‚Äî maybe by this time next year they will have changed and added new perks! Or made it easier to level them up! Who knows.. My goal however is to get back to the level I was at on my Playstation on the Series X by this time next year.
---
You will have to get high level. Highest anything is 100 but I don‚Äôt know what animals will be upped to. I never tamed anything since beta. But if it‚Äôs level 50 you will have to wait until you‚Äôre up there in levels now
---
Number of ammo of that type in your inventory. üòÅ
---
Idk how scaling works with tamable after the rebalancing, I‚Äôve yet to run across one. But most should cap at level 50. Meaning you need to be 150 until you can tame a level 50 wild encounter. Tamed animals used to be under leveled, I‚Äôll be hunting one myself tonight as level 100 crickets one shot my pet.
---
Was the trade threw the trading sub?
---
Well it sounds like gaming is really important in your friends circle, so hopefully they will all grow to love FO as much as you do :)
---
Unfortunately you have to load the critical to make it happens 100% (unless you miss, I presume).
---
I always forget to personally. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You still crit from time to time on normal shots, I suppose it's luck based.
---
I don't play on PC, however you do need either hit or hold the button for crits to engage. Holding is the easiest
---
As a VATS crit commando build...it's just second nature to me to hold down the crit button while engaged in combat, so much so that *I can't even remember what button you are supposed to hit* off the top of my head.
---
It's just muscle memory
---
It was my first (and last) time trading.  Scammer posted about having 800 Lbs of Legacies and quality weapons so I respond interested.  We chat in a party about the trade, what I want and what he wants.  I request a BE Flamer and TSE Gatling Plasma.  Scammer requests a bundle of four weapons and some armor I don‚Äôt care about.  Scammer won‚Äôt set his prices until mine are set as his are Legacy.  After setting my prices he takes the weapons, kicks me from the party and continues to trade (scam) others.  I honestly should‚Äôve known better, but I wanted to trust him unfortunately.  Two IE Miniguns and a B FSP Grognaks Axe gone.  I know.. I can‚Äôt blame anyone but myself really.
---
I find it amusing when I get a fatman and 3 missles as a reward.
---
The majority of players could not achieve it, and they would be frustrated as hell. I think it's good as it is.
---
I wish the trading system was more secure.  It‚Äôs just so wrong.
---
Yeah, anyone who's trading legacies...I always ask we use a courier.
---
Gaming is everything to us. We all went to high school together, but one by one moved away. Lost contact. None of us had consoles back then. We used to play fortnite on our phones. But then one day we all reconnected on Instagram and found out everyone had playstations (about two years after we all graduated) and we‚Äôve been gaming since then. Even all met up in person once or twice
---
Thank you for the heads up
---
Dunno if if this is a poorly kept secret or not but if you frequently buy 5.56 like I do at 1c, Mini nukes give 3.33 rounds of 5.56 per nuke, 40mm at 1.40:1, missiles at 2:1, and cannonballs at 1:1.  Any time I see those in someone's camp for 1c (really below the conversion rate), I buy them and convert.  It's not a lot but I just bank the points to make sure I have backup and over time it really adds up.
---
These are also the only 4 ammo in the game worth buying at 1c or more and converting to 5.56 vs buying 5.56 straight up at 1c.  The first three (no cannonballs) also work for .45 to a lesser degree.
---
You are probably at 1% completion of the game. Maybe less.
---
It's not dumb, it's a weird mechanic. As already said, you have to press the critical button (I guess it's space for PC users) then press the fire button to use a critical shot. It's kind of lame that you can't use criticals outside of VATS naturally, but that's the way the cookie crumbles eh. Good luck with the arthritis, I know it's not fun (arthritis in my spine).
---
You should known something was up when he agreed to a deal that was a severe rip off. Did he have negative karma?
---
It‚Äôs a low chance of mystery pick now
---
Doesn't scamming go against the new TOS that just came out?
---
I can sell you a bridge too, if you're interested.
---
Can confirm as a stealth commando build when their head is turned around (mostly happens with super mutants) my 80%-95% hit chance will drop to like 8%-25%
---
Kind of defeats the purpose tho of showing off a unique item you have.
---
Tamed pets require 0 budget now.
---
I had this problem as well. Then I found out that not only stored things but blueprinted things count toward your CAMP budget. I was getting rid of stored items but not blueprinted ones. Once I cleared out all of my blueprints and scrapped the items it autostored when I did, my budget went back to normal.
---
Worked for me. I dunno if you've already done all of that or not though. If you have, sounds like it's a new bug with Patch 22.
---
Xbox sorry man
---
It's even worse when you just load in to a nuke and your camp blows up, which just happened to me
---
Sorry man. It's a sucky feeling
---
You also only need 3 charisma, Animal Friend 3 and wasteland whisperer is not required to tame any pets. There's a lot of old and wrong info online.
---
Unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt.  It was through a ‚ÄúLooking group post‚Äù which I always hesitate to interest myself in for this reason.  I can tell you that is the last time I look through those posts.
---
Not if you have a bunker design! When I can be asked, I‚Äôm gonna build an underground armory and power house, with an active base topside.
---
I loved my serrated revolutionary sword early in the game. Going melee will save you lots of ammo and you get used to deal with the enemy at close range.. comes handy later if you do a shotgun build.üòÅ
---
Ps. A skisword is also nice with the extra damage metal shards.
---
It does, they‚Äôve been very clear with the wording about it too. OP might be able to get the guy banned if he‚Äôs got the evidence but you never know with Bethesda
---
I think I pulled a brain muscle trying to understand the question üòÇ
---
Yeah never trade threw those unless it's for caps with in the 30k limit. Stick to the trading sub, been there for nearly 2 years with 0 issues
---
Yeah, 50/50 with them.
---
What exactly could these Hunters do to affect him.. that isn‚Äôt illegal?
---
pc master race
---
Pre test of the ps5 have shown it can barley do 4k at 60fps without overheating while xbox has no issues. I'm not trying to sound fan boyish just facts. 
---
Honestly when xbox was on top (360 gen) they wernt as shady as sony is now. As soon as ps4 was top dog sony started being extra shady. No cross play, year long exclusives etc..  where xbox has been pro crossplay, gamepass is a steal etc..
---
I assume you got your once per day already?
---
Happened to me two days in a row, finished it solo in less than 7:30 in first attempts, nothing. The 80% plus chance is completely bs.
---
Damn. The way the game calculates is insane
---
Check out fed 76 and put in those traits. It does exist, but I haven‚Äôt gotten one before. It should give you a rough estimate on its value. Hope this helps
---
Titties, yes, i remember.
---
It was through a ‚ÄúLooking group post‚Äù and not the trading sub.  Bad move on my part.  1000% lesson learned.
---
I bought all the SS armor pieces but will do the solar next as they are guaranteed 3* rolls, unlike the SS.
---
I had no idea this was a thing! Is there a settler equivalent?
---
Have had it happen 3 times now myself
---
&gt; this was to me, one of the best and most needed changes to the game‚Äôs base experience for it to continue. Yes, a few tweaks are needed to smooth it out, but these concepts actually bring back some risk to the game, even just wandering around the wasteland, and actually make it feel like a dangerous world. 
---
And I totally understand that, but what I see is totally the opposite. What is the point of choosing the perfect cards and gear if everywhere I go is a "challenge" now? Building your character... all that feels useless to me now. There's no sense of progression.
---
I hadn't thought of that - thank you!
---
Time to burn one with the homies
---
Vampire minigun/gatling laser works fine too. Sometimes you just need to change yur loadout/perks.
---
Right. Luckily you didn‚Äôt loose anything too crazy.
---
Day 1 Elder solo nothing, Day 2 Caged lights, Day 3, 4, 5 again...nothing, 80%  my ballbags.
---
Today I've been using some built up workshops I found and I actually had varied enemies, and it felt way more fun. I'm level 80 something, and level 60 mole rats were attacking, except the special "poisonous" one that was like the alpha, who was level 95. I was able to melee them to preserve ammo. Later 3 waves of scorpions that were my level attacked, and I couldn't afford to preserve ammo, and I actually felt like I was at risk of losing my workshop.
---
A ban is exactly what I would like.  I‚Äôm okay with losing the weapons to take a scammer and his arsenal of (probably) scammed weapons off the game.
---
I will give that a go, thx!
---
I'm sire it exists. Go to r. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 without the periods and ask there
---
Not a bad idea, I really don't like players that don't realize or care that I can hear their family life. Or the occasional little kid with the stupid blaring pop songs.üòÅüòÅ
---
I don't even do it now, hence only 5 days :-)
---
Because it makes it hard to aim. You said it yourself. It breaks immersion, sure. But it is a valid tactic and common in videogames. 
---
It should be a jetpack instead.
---
I hope floater grenades start to come in different non-stackable varieties that are functionally the same as each other, but cosmetically different.
---
This is what the people want Bethesda
---
Turn shadows almost all the way down, grass almost all the way off, and may need to crank water down. Should run way smoother.
---
2070S, 3900X, 16gb, 3840x1600 butter smooth except on the golf course (grass) or massive amounts of ash piles.
---
Ran same settings with my old gtx970 too (same cpu/ram). Ran pretty good.
---
I do have shadows/grass turned way down to low though. everything else highest settings.
---
I do the same thing, If i have more legendaries coming in than I can scrip on 5 characters in a day, and i know no one will buy it, I just sell for caps
---
It could be one of two things:
---
1. You're using a Vampire's weapon, but the enemy used an Uno Reverse card.
---
2. Todd Howard is laughing at you.
---
You have exactly 20% chances to get no rewards. Maybe tomorrow you'll get 3 rewards, which is a very remote possibility numbers wise. 
---
Random. üòä
---
Uplink.  Your job is to rush the marked enemies and the boss in the next part.  I love and appreciate a melee build in my ops.  Usually something slips through if it‚Äôs camo and having someone watching my back is nice
---
Yeah my Rifleman is struggling. In controlled situations where I can take it slow - like overworld play - he's relatively fine, but for groups or events (where stealth isn't an option) he's really underperforming.
---
I feel your pain I‚Äôve got 9 tied up in them and couldn‚Äôt make the bow work for me but I still don‚Äôt want to scrap them ,  could you play as a bloodied hunter so you get the unyielding buffs and really push your bows or crossbows damage per shot ? Should be able to trade for a bow on the other Reddit site
---
Thanks for that, I may try a foot pedal if the game allows such bunding.
---
&gt; The 80% plus chance is completely bs.
---
Nice to see someone else who realizes this.
---
I does not increase the damage of hack and slash as that is not an explosion but just AOE Damage
---
Melee, especially if you find or are gifted a low level legendary.  uses no ammo, and are quite effective, especially if you find (or are gifted) a low level one.
---
I ran across a vampire machete when I was about L20, and haven‚Äôt looked back.
---
Do collision course - you will likely loot a good starter melee weapon, or get one in the container drop.
---
I wouldn't worry about the legality of it as these are very experienced players.  Either it isn't "illegal" or they can work around it.  
---
They kill him....sometimes repeatedly.....while relaying any message you may want sent.

---
80% is a load of bullshit for sure.
---
trade in the tokens at the end of lode baring.
---
Yeah if you have a high rate of fire weapon, and enough AP, holding the critical button (Y in my case, xbox) while in VATS and firing will "chain" or automatically apply them when available. Works the same for semi auto as well, you just don't get as many\as fast. But as to your question, yes you need to hit the space bar at least once, when a crit is available. After that I would think you can hold the space bar to apply any further crits, provided you don't leave your current VATS "session", then your start over. That's how it works on Xbox and definitely becomes second nature after awhile. Maxing out critical savvy will have you spamming crits, if that's what you're into
---
&gt;VATS crit commando build
---
I guess that's what my build is, minus the crit part ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
My understanding, only one does the "no hiding" rule....and if its timed based, why hide
---
Stealth doesn't work in Uplink. But Bethesda has said nothing about future missions. Just swap out Sneak perks in favour of damage mitigation perks and it's easy breezy.
---
Jinxed it did it on my other character nothing again XD nope this was first time today on both characters
---
This is a staple Galleria visit move for me
---
Aw well.
---
You have so much more patience and tenacity than I do, Vladimir.
---
Once the Pip-Boy goes on, it don't come off.
---
I feel you. Same happened to me. Load the game. Mission list on the screen saying Death from Above countdown just expired. Game continue to load it's things before give me control over my character. Open the map just to see my camp was on the nuke zone. Cries.
---
Bloody hell it‚Äôs crazy how unoptimised this game is. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if ampere had the exact same issues even at top flight
---
Unfortunately animals sent to camps can be killed. Im so sorry about your megasloth.
---
Yep, I just wear PA and use a Gauss shotgun, Gat Plasma.  I go back to sneak commando for everything else.
---
Thanks! I'll try to press or hold the space but it's such an odd action really tweaks the joint.
---
Hope u find someone :)
---
It wouldn't reduce your daily sales. You'd just do them all at the same time instead of 4 hours earlier. Wouldn't hurt you at all.
---
Did anyone reveal why it won't transfer?   I mean, if another xbox one can sync up to what you've done on another xbox one, why couldn't an xbox x do the same?   I wonder what makes that impossible.   Different servers?
---
Test it at Daily Ops today, against the mutants. If it works the and keeps you alive, make it your Ops Weapon. 
---
I have tested all my vampire weapons, and it's not necessary to be a commando to benefit from the legendary effect. 
---
Rifleman, shotgunner, they work well. You don't need to fire fast if you can pack a strong punch. 
---
For example, I am soloing today's Ops with a Vampire Gatling Gun. And I want to find a vampire western revolver to bring some class into the whole thing.
---
I‚Äôm not hiding I‚Äôm stealthing which my build is heavily designed around.
---
It should. You can use software to set up macros in game that allow pressing any key to act as pressing any other key. For example you could set up a macro that uses Mouse 3, 4 or 5 as Space
---
Edit: I'm aware that macros are generally frowned upon for cheesing repetitive tasks but if you're using it for key binding replacement, I can't see why it would be an issue. I use a macro to scroll up and down cause my right hand has issues sometimes
---
Me too, it sucks

Aluminium is one of the harder to find scrap materials. One useful place you can get to easily at your level is Morgantown High school (top right area in Morgantown, not the Vault Tech university), I'm the kitchens you will find aluminium cans and and upstairs a load of cake tins on desks. The place is also fill of plastic which is useful for bulking spare scrap to sell at station vendors.
---
On the upside, you know this will only ever happen to you once!
---
Sorry to hear that :( people suck! I‚Äôd say if trading do it through the market sub, at least there you can check people‚Äôs karma and see how many trades they‚Äôve done/check their comment history and see their legit trades. Hope you get your weapons back :)
---
Well you could have been even more pissingly unlucky and got two caged light plans today to go with the caged light plan you got yesterday....
---
Once again, you don't hold multimillion dollar corporations to the same standards you do to individual victims of a crime.
---
Are you sure ? I mean i see no blast zone effect there...
---
For now but more locations and missions will be added
---
This is such a shame, it seems really odd that they have a system in place with perks to compliment, automatically fills a meter, but doesn't use this credit automatically unless you hit *another key*.
---
Question would be 'why if you want to use crits system and its meter is filled would you not want it to be used' why hold on to it? No logic.
---
Todd ?

5.00 Team, 7.50 solo. But I know we can do better.

The Burrows, I always get lost.

Damnnn

They already did that
---
I actually use mini nukes via Daisycutter. They are fine hellos for mobs. Missiles go to the ammo converter. I use grenades often. I just wish Floaters had a wider spread. I have a vloodied plasma gatling gun so even the cores for those come in handy when I face the Queen or Earle. So far the only mostly useless thing for me are  fusion cores. Those things drop way too often for someone who doesn't use a laser gatling or PA often other than to survive large drops.
---
Day 1 was very challenging because people didnt read/understand the resilience mutation, everything except for that has been a breeze for me.
---
Release the left trigger, aim again and aim down sights again.

Killer shot

There are less repair kits as well, probably not coincidence.
---
  I usually do WS And get 1-5.  While I‚Äôm there, its not unusual for UF to start, so there‚Äôs 3 more.
---
By the time UF is done, WS has respawned, so do the circuit again.  Bonus is I‚Äôll get nearly 20k XP from WS Alone, plus whatever I get at UF....On a really good day, RR also kicks off....
---
Tbh daily ops plans are flying off the shelf tho, i sold an extra vault 94 suit for 15,000 caps and it‚Äôs ugly xd
---
Right. I'm gonna be 'that guy' and ask, can we trust those numbers? What actually goes into this "datamining"? Do we have any *actual proof* that those figures actually accurate, or did somebody just pull them out of thin air?
---
Because I gotta say it, ["eIgHtY PeRcEnT cHaNcE"](https://imgur.com/YOBnG3k).
---
I am in the same boat and I think when they say rare they apparently mean it, I got a super reactor and a vault 94 jumpsuit on day 1 and nothing since despite getting elder every time. Fingers crossed the rng will bless us in time

I‚Äôve missed out on getting a reward 5 times in a row after getting elder rank. I‚Äôm starting to think that 80% is not actually the percent chance.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the amount of players doing daily ops affects the amount of enemies you get. But I‚Äôve been able to get elder on all daily ops so far with my gf. She‚Äôs a commando build (not a sneak) and I switch around between unarmed and heavy gun. Us 2 standing by the uplink is more than enough to get elder. 
---
Whenever we go public, we usually get 3 people on the uplink and one person is usually lost somewhere across the map. So although it would be AWESOME to have all 4 players next to the uplink, it is definitely not required. 
---
If you‚Äôre a melee build it makes sense for you to sit by the uplink since you most likely won‚Äôt be able to run and kill an enemy before somebody shoots it. 
---
But by all means, feel free to do whatever you want. You deserve to get kills and loot as much as the rest of us. Just TRY to make sure there‚Äôs at least two people on the uplink if you‚Äôre trying to go for elder. So if you only see one person, bite the bullet and go stand by the uplink.
---
card packs are rewards in Season 2 (and were for 1 too)
---
Be wise sneak attacks double and then some
---
Your damage
---
And no Platinum player icon...
---
Ya the resilience mutation is the hardest, especially when it‚Äôs those damn anti armor gutsys just shredding you. My armor gets destroyed by those damn robots
---
5 times in a row and nothing. I‚Äôm inclined to agree with you.
---
Today is a very easy day. Out Dense on your Chest Armor and watch as exploding enemies do 0 damage to you. Yesterday with Freezing Robots was a bit of a pain, especially solo. Resilient anything is a little annoying but gun bashing or taking a Bloodied melee weapon does the trick
---
cook all the meat and sell it, sell purified water
---
I cant find Platinum girl on a board...
---
have you tried making/joining a daily ops and then starting one but not "starting" one until people join
---
The other day I laughed so hard since I realized a guy was hated by half map since he got his camp and two workshops nuked in like 15 mim üòÇ
---
Appreciate it. Move was successful
---
Yes. I‚Äôve gotten over 40 of them. Useless for me.
---
Sorry I don't understand the last sentence.  Can you please clarify?  Thanks!
---
I‚Äôve got elder rank twice. First time the Ops suit and second time I got the 94 vault plan
---
It started with 7 weeklies, now there's 9. How many do you need?
---
If you miss the first shot, just get out of vats and engage vats again. Works everytime.
---
Okay, I was wrong.  I spent the last 2 hours testing.  I realized I rarely open any containers,  I always just skip most of them.  I went ed and hit all 3 silos and the 3 big open world weight sites and then hit Morgantown airport since it is filthy with containers and loose junk.  After I did that I went back and was able to loot everything again.  I did have to server hop to get it to work, but I will be grinding this out ALL DAY and restock on ammo for a month lol.  
---
   Glad I was wrong.  From now on I just gotta hit containers when I farm!
---
Things an absolute beast without demo expert. To bad my ammo converter is glitched and it gave me flares instead of spikes so I unknowingly went in an op with only 90 rounds for it.
---
Good advice ty
---
6:11
---
Unyielding is still popular.  Because even if you aren‚Äôt running a build with bloodied weapons , you can still benefit from the extra stat bonuses for all your skills.
---
At that level a week or so ago. I've got loads and loads of quests in my pipboy data tab. There are main story, side quests and daily's there. I turn on only a couple in the same area and loot everything there while doing those quests, then travel home to scrap everything and plan my next loot run. I've grown fond of looting Morgantown mainly for the microscopes but there's a good variety of buildings and loot there, plus usually a public event while I'm looting.
---
I think the base concept is having you save a crit for when it matters.
---
As far as I remember you could stack them in previous Fallout games, I think... ü§î
---
But since you can probably crit every other shot with some weapons it ain't working great. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The scorchebeast Queen is completely immune to explosives. The regular ones are not. So feel free to use that on them.
---
Not sure if it was on xbox lfg, but it's full of people who just scam all day. There is no downside to them doing it there. No punishment other than people calling them out. There's always new people for them to scam.
---
I've only done trades with people in a trading sub around here. They actually want to do a good trade because you increase each other's karma and get even better trades going forward ideally.
---
i have, yes! tysm. sometimes it works and often people don‚Äôt bite lol. but thanks - fortunately i did just find one person for it !
---
What is the resilience mutation?
---
They scale with demo expert instead of heavy gunner for perk cards
---
Under normal circumstances players cannot damage your pet. I've seen people waste ammo on mine many times just as a natural reaction to seeing a normally hostile creature.
---
What platform and name? Might nuke him to for fun (kidding)
---
there was an update. a huge massive update.
---
first op was literally the highest difficulty: resilient bots in the burrows.
---
burrows is the hardest map because alpha, bravo and the boss are so far apart. valley galleria is the easiest.
---
bots are the hardest, muties are medium difficulty and eagles the easiest. resilient is by far the worst unless you're melee, volatile might as well not even be a trait thanks to fireproof and dense. cloaked can be a pain to work around, too. freezing is just a time waster but can result in some pretty nasty scenarios, like getting staggered while frozen.
---
It's 6 20% of base damage
---
Dang, I have been throwing granades at her and use my gauss shotgun.üôÑü§îüòÄ
---
The perk card slots are account wide. Let‚Äôs say you have a level 300 character and a level 1. That level 1 will have all perk slots available.
---
I got 2 rewards 2 days in a row, and one of them had the same item twice.
---
It is what it is. üòÇ
---
That's beautiful!
---
The "good morning" signs from the diner set give a lovely reflection on water too, as does the fire barrel and the nuka quantum lamp.
---
If you‚Äôre asking to be funny, they mysteriously disappear into the shadows zone. Right next to where my missing socks seem to go. 
---
If you‚Äôre being serious, once you‚Äôre at max caps, and somebody buys something from you, you loot caps off a corpse, or you complete an event that rewards you caps. You‚Äôll still get the caps, however it will say ‚ÄúMax caps‚Äù and you‚Äôll miss out and lose them. 
---
So it‚Äôs best to spend your caps once‚Äôs you‚Äôre at max. Even if it‚Äôs not a lot.
---
Can't wait to, with no pre announcements, we have a random encounter with someone like the Overseer, Ward, etc and we find out that the Institute is around for some time and Appalachia never noticed üò∂

Probably a legacy weapon
---
üëçGotta share the love man!
---
Wasn't sure since it definitely looks explosive. It triggers an explosion to act as the AOE so I wasn't sure if it was buffed
---
Love it.  I've gotten lucky with a couple of shots, but nothing that epic.
---
Lamp
---
Camp pets suicide quite a bit by loading up higher and falling. 
---
Also, play in pacifist mode. Shouldn't have been able to kill it that way.
---
Mine often have some odd audio/visual bugs, it‚Äôll play the audio of 1-2 extra rounds shooting than what‚Äôs actually shown on my ammo counter, there‚Äôs definitely some latency in the shots registering too, so I have to fire them in bursts to ensure I don‚Äôt accidentally dump half a mag into an enemy unnecessarily
---
Also all of my handmades have been breaking ridiculously quick compared to my fixers and shotguns lately
---
No but its impossible to give PTS feedback when you couldn't have used it in PTS in the first place. You are implying that it could not have been fixed but in reality it couldn't have been fixed in the first place cause no one could have used it. It would've been discovered definitely and been changed by now. And you're implying that I would think Bethesda won't do anything about it. You're getting riled up by your statement and don't realize it couldn't have been fixed cause no ome could have used it. Hard to fix something no one can use, ya know?
---
can only be killed with melee attacks. so either you have to use a melee weapon or bash them when they're at 1 hp.
---
Just the fact of getting nothing even though done elder 1st time twice in a row XD different characters
---
I fast travelled around the map dropping them off to lower level players, easily 8 bits of armour and 10 or so weapons just today. Damned if I am lugging it around till the next day and besides, I will earn more for scrip.
---
Wtf? How?
---
The explosive gatling lasers and plasmas are ideal for pvp since it's really about dps than per shot with the damage cap.
---
I‚Äôll have to try that. Thanks for the tip
---
Tldr: pcmr
---
It wasnt promoted very well. Unless you read the inside the vault every Thursday and keep up with the official bethesda site it was easy to miss
---
Yes but more
---
With how many just absolutely useless rolls there are an then 1 an 2 star versions of each as well. Its endless!
---
Rewards aren't only the "rare" rewards. You still get additional items depending on the tier.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iupqbw/psa_this_is_how_daily_ops_rewards_work/
---
its not difficult its the fact its mandatory.
---
just like how you can just "not use the meta", sure you could not use it, but your severely handicapping yourself if you dont.
---
nobody likes being handicapped.
---
so why not just buff the bad options so that they are more viable without devaluing fusion generators? they would still be the best power output option but at least i can just use a large generator if i didnt want a fusion and still get reasonable output.
---
currently if i wanted to run a 30 power requiring camp i would need 3 large generators. thats a shit ton of space and resources where as fusion is overkill amount of power.
---
if i had a camp that only needed 10 power i would need either 4 small generators or 2 medium generators, medium are still pretty big and small ones require greater amounts to use so they lose the "small and compact" appeal.
---
more options is never a bad thing.
---
One of the bigger complaints was the useless filler, so they decided to double down on it. /shrug
---
If they keep following this trend, season 3 is going to be really trash.
---
Don't trust what people tell you. I'm disputing the accuracy of the datamine. It's not 80%. They got the numbers wrong.
---
Melee works fine for daily ops except the freezy one. You just need to be more tanky than a stealth bloodied build.
---
You should take screen captures of them and save them.
---
More than ok! Thank you very much!
---
I used a two shot one for a long time. I dont always lug it around with me but it is fun to use.
---
Thanks so much, really helpsüôåüèª

Yeah, weed!

But seriously, who‚Äôs the narc downvoting all the comments?

I like this one, thank you!!

So. I died in vain.
---
‚ÄúLuck‚Äù I wanted a full unyielding secret service set. And I took me a total of 60 something attempts until I finally got a full set. 
---
My chest and my arm piece aren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúperfect‚Äù so I‚Äôm still trying to get better rolls for them. 
---
But I got soooooo many vanguard. Ghoul slayer. Sentinel. Troubleshooter, chameleon, weightless stuff. That were all basically dropped and destroyed because I had so many. 
---
The only ones I kept for a little while were the weightless since I sold those for script and they didn‚Äôt take a lot of room on my character.
---
I know about the update.  Im saying 3 20% cards equals 60% of base.  There's no way that can be equal to 6 damage.  They did something wrong.
---
Im suspicious that they missed a decimal and we are getting 6% instead of 60%
---

---
1 chance a day, per tier
---
No problem
---
Can't say I agree fully. It's incredibly easy to solo Daily Ops in under 8 minutes.
---
They're fun with a Fat Man. I got a Troubleshooter's Fat Man during Fastnacht, so of course I got dozens of mini-nukes from Super Mutant Suiciders during other events and shot them off where ever I could.
---
Well some areas are still ‚Äúeasy‚Äù, the forest, toxic valley, and ash heap are all still pretty simple, minus a handful of places that are allowed to have over 50 spawns. In areas like the forest, the level 50‚Äôs have still been going down in one or two shots as long as I have specialized my character.  So for most people, you can still explore those regions with little worry.  I‚Äôve even done a test recently using really bad gear in what is a tough area, and it went fine.  The ability to explore and gather materials in a casual way still exists, it‚Äôs just less casual. 
---
And for the areas that are tougher, it still benefits you to keep working on your character, because you do reach a point where even the tougher areas are easy (minus some of the crowns and legendaries, and a few other random monsters). 
---
I mean, we were in a bad place.  Even without bloodied and other high end builds, I could just one shot most enemies with my cruddy sniper.  Some you tubers were making videos showing them clearing out areas with bad (or in one case, no) gear.  
---
Even after the changes,  you have you tubers such as angry turtle who was going into daily ops with a non-legendary pipe weapon and killing the enemies there.  I mean if the weakest weapon in the game, without any mods on it, can be used to clear the new end game content, the changes can‚Äôt be that severe.  A couple of days ago, without using a good build I was able to clear out West Tek of it‚Äôs 75/100 super mutants.  This was done first with All Rise, then with a ghoul slayer baton.  Taking that back to the forest was easy.  I even tried doing unarmed in there without even slotting iron fist and 3-4 hits with my Deathclaw Gauntlet took them out. 
---
So I guess my summary since I had a lot there, I think:
---
* some areas are still easy, and accessible (such as the forest), it‚Äôs just less easier than before 
---
* we are still encouraged to keep working on our character and maxing out our cards so what is harder becomes easier
---
Alternate suggestion, let us put them in liberty prime and hear them talk as that instead. 
---
Or have it that when we break up with them that athena moves in instead. We can count birds together.
---
I hit up every event I see, at level 413
---
I very rarely get something that is worth to keep or sell. The weight limit in the stash makes it even more miserable.
---
I‚Äôve tried building things in my bfs camp but it wouldn‚Äôt let me, says you‚Äôre not the camp owner. Lol.
---
How?  Trading or duping.
---
Isn't it mostly energy damage?
---
Damn.that would suck.glad you fixed it
---
&gt;If it has been in games, since i last remember in Modern Warfare 2
---
Modern Warfare 2's engine is not the same engine as the Fallout series. Any dual weapon added to Fallout, like the dual pistol mod for fallout 4, isn't true dual wield: it's a single weapon that has an alternating fire animation and only uses the one button for firing, unlike dual weapons in any other FPS series. Also for Elder Scrolls dualcasting is often an integral aspect of the build of a mage, which is why it is designed to allow it.  
---
~~Also also dual wielding is highly impractical in general and is only really sensible in Action films like John Wick~~
---
If you're not on the wind-up then you must have misunderstood. It's not that it couldn't possibly be fixed, it's that I wouldn't trust them to fix it in time for release even if it had been available in the PTS.  There is ample evidence for this, such as the numerous warnings that Fasnacht critters wouldn't spawn, in plenty of time for them to fix it, but they just... didn't.  And the large amount of feedback about Patch 22 which was... let's just say controversial when it was implemented.  Not to mention the seemingly endless bugs in season 1 rewards!
---
Bottom line is I just think you're giving them waaaaay too much credit, and it's cute.
---
I love that event in general. It‚Äôs a really good one. Too bad I see it so rarely. Feels like it doesn‚Äôt pop up too often.
---
Don't forget that when you unlock a Legendary Perk slot, the **slot** is available for ALL your characters.  My highest character is 220 so I now have 5 Legendary Perk slots available for my other characters as well.  This means my new level 5 melee build started by walking around with "What rads?" and can skip Lead Belly perks in her early levels.  I'll add more as I level her up, but what a difference in early QoL.
---
I'm actively hitting them all up at 192
---
Even the crap ones now.
---
ill give 40 of 100% fusion cores 10caps each PC noone buys them
---
It was indeed on Xbox.  The kid even asked if I had a Paypal.  To think he may be scamming others out of real money makes me sick.
---
With mods I believe so just normal war glaive is just a spear I had zero mods zero effects on it and was destorying
---
Appreciate it!
---
I dunno, I didn‚Äôt understand why people were upset with VATS because I was hitting everything in the first shot and commando was just OP because of it.  I was hitting enemies behind walls with it.
---
Now it‚Äôs definitely less accurate than it was pre-update.
---
Cracking photo mate, so good I have put it as my desktop wallpaper
---
That's a shame, were you in a private team like invited through the list or through the building team? What I read was from about a year ago but they said you had to form a private team.
---
Ill take some downvote agro of him. Ive dropped nukes on players simply because their bases were close enough to hit multiple of them
---
Very useful
---
Last night I had a guy hit me then kill me with a legacy..I was on my level 40 but i did have a instigating tesla..well I killed him once but I know he wasnt happy because I stole his junk while he was in his f1st tent.lmao I stashed his junk real quick in his own tent.so we can kill these guys buts it's one sided 80%of the time
---
It's the only gun that uses them
---
You can put a splitter on it to make it shoot a green fog, kinda like a flame thrower. But it really sucks
---
Ooooof.  If you're on PC and need some I'm carting around something like 3k.  Ops have been net positive on spikes for me so I can afford to ditch a few hundred.
---
Issue with melee is you have to run out of the area of the uplink sometimes if u want hits or kills. Where on my pa heavy gunner I legit sit in the uplink and delete everything without having to move.
---
That sucks that rng has not been kind to you.
---
I cant remember exactly but I think this is the thing in the bottom of one of the mines. It's been like 2 years since I ran through it but theres a mine that had a ton of cultists worshipping something in the depths.
---
I've now had 3 days with no reward at elder...
---
What about Santatron, he thinks Christmas is an all year event
---
Pretty sure any event in the forest has a chance to reward both
---
Same here.. I feel ya
---
In this mode nobody is bothered about playing with low levels and its not seen as carrying since you are helping. Its a team effort. You didn't slow them down only speeded them up
---
Usually people get it through trading due to its rarity, but it‚Äôs an extremely rare drop from events in a certain region (I want to say ash heap, but I could be completely wrong). I believe you could also get it as a super rare drop from responders quests awhile ago, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs still an option.
---
I'm not having trouble as melee in the ops, not even in the frenzy one. Tho that robot boss is the only one who seems to give me a hard time.
---
Not that I'm complaining tho, I like the challenge.
---
Would rather they beef up the other bosses.
---
Thanks for your response!  I suspect it's in lucky hole but don't have a chance to look around yet
---
Lol okay. Bug where you get insane strength buffs in a update that is meant to reduce overall effectiveness of SPECIAL and it wouldn't be patched. You'd be insane to think otherwise as simple code change would've fixed it and now they have to wait for permission from Sony and Miceosoft to enforce it, thus longer time of not using it.
---
I think I got it from Guided Meditation.
---
Best way to get one is trade rare items.a b2525 handmade or fixer a j2525 handmade or fixer if we can trade the new daily ops plans some one might make a trade.i saw some one trade a miner mask from earl for a legacy when that event came out
---
Me too but the other way around.
---
All 3* drops  are 1* now to reduce user frustration with scrip limits. üòÅ
---
There will always be people who want something for nothing. These 3x level players harassing you are just a bunch of beggars. Block them, watch your back for nuke jackers when you're in the final stages of launch and have fun. They didn't earn the nuke and there are 2 different silo's for them to go to, it's nobodies problem but theirs.
---
At the very least, they should make it so we get scrip vouchers for our scripped legendaries. That way we can exchange the weightless vouchers for scrip at our leisure.
---
I don't see the point of a role playing game if every role has something as significant as combat performance in common 
---
It's not like you even need combat perks in the game anyway, if you dont want to invest in perks, you can improve your gear instead 
---
My backup weapon is a non legendary flaming bow,  and I can kill most everything on the map in 2 or 3 shots unless it's something like a yao guai or deathclaw, even then it's not too much of a hassle, and I don't have any bow damage perks at all
---
People are saying non automatic weapons are trash, but a fully modded out lever action rifle, gauss rifle, or a pipe revolver pistol/rifle is more than enough for survivability in the game
---
There's also power armor if you don't want to invest in any defensive perks 
---
You should be able to survive just fine, it'll take you a bit longer to takedown enemies but isn't that the tradeoff for not investing in combat perks? The only thing you'd have trouble with are certain event quests and bosses, but those are intended to be done in groups anyway so no big loss, the majority of the game is still playable
---
I believe its 60% of the base damage with no legendary buffs
---
For the up link missions which we have available, yes. But bethesda has said that they will be bringing out other modes that will have a different default mutation. Having stealth removed for these uplink missions was a  obvious balancing choice considering the objective of the mode.
---
Since you have sufficient evidence of the scam, you should be able to get this little toe rag banned. It‚Äôs now explicitly against the ToS, and it‚Äôs one of very few things that isn‚Äôt poorly worded.
---
I no longer min-max my build I seem to be doing fine with 1 in each perk slot for damage and using other things for damage..
---
Per the Wiki:
---
Extremely rare reward from the following quests or events in the Forest or the Toxic Valley:
---
Fly Swatter
---
Thirst Things First
---
Target Rich Environment
---
(Not to be confused with the Fire Breathers outfit which I always think of)
---
I go to every one I see except tea time, and even when I'm in  the 'event' teams it's still just me.
---
Why are you do the work of god? I thank you for that
---
One of the main reasons is that Public Events provide Treasury Notes.  Since A.C.P. provides 8 Treasury Notes and you can only use 20 a day, some players may be stocking up on that. Or at least avoiding events they don‚Äôt like.  Why bother doing Tea Time, Swarm of Suitors or Distinguished Guests?
---
You keep saying what Bethesda games are all about, but you know what RPG games are all about (including Bethesda games)? Progression.
---
You say you don't want to turn the wasteland in a peaceful cakewalk, but is something that's is in the nature of RPGs. Is what RPGs are all about. About building your character and make it a God amongst men, about looking back and say "60 hours ago I couldn't even kill the weakest enemy in the game, now, I'm kicking the final boss' ass". Right now... there's 0 sense of progression in 76. Feels like all this grind is worthless. Doesn't matter where I go, how strong I get... enemies are always going to magically catch me up and I have to start all over again.
---
And as I said, you don't need to turn everything in a peaceful cakewalk, only the things that need it. That's what the endgame it's for, to always have that "carrot in front of your nose", but Bethesda's endgame understanding is totally erroneous.
---
Is this to do with the Interloper in Lucky Hole Mine?
---
In a team, I just don‚Äôt. I move to be out of the time of fire and wait for a team mate to get them or for them to move closer. Or tank it out obvs this doesn‚Äôt work for robots).
---
This is mine I use with my bloodied fixer somethings are different being I have more points from legendary perks

That‚Äôs where you want to go. Explore THOROUGHLY.
---
Go kill a bunch of super mutants and mole miners, then sell whatever they drop to the nearest vendor.
---
On the card it was 6 damage.  This would be 60% of 10.  Theres no way they can be using 10 as the base.
---
I've gotten at least one rare reward every day.  One day I got two.
---
Once a day if you clear elder time first go through , but you can do it with multiple characters
---
Very sufficient evidence.  Full trade and name.  I‚Äôm only curious if I‚Äôll receive confirmation of his ban.
---
you would think they'd drop more often wouldn't you. but noooo. These rare rewards seem to be less common than other rewards.
---
It‚Äôs when something slips behind you I feel useful. The rest of the time I‚Äôm standing there poking with my 50 ish gun damage. I can two shot most shit down there with my sledge though.
---
Vault 88 and the DLC that introduced it seemed like a great idea at the time. Until I realised that the build limit was nowhere near big enough to actually use all those caverns they gave you access to.
---
Instanced interior camps sound great now, but we really shouldn't expect too much.
---
I have been wondering the same thing. I keep getting blocked from posting images.
---
Nah man. I hit up uranium fever every time it pops up now. So much xp, dedicated lego spawns, tons of steel, and I sell everything else I pick up in there. This event pays to do now. And easy to solo. 
---
The problem is there‚Äôs too many &lt;!&gt; public events that have poor rewards or no rewards other than treasury notes. No legos at line in the sand (unless a scorchbeast happens to be), no great rewards for swarm of suiters, same with lode bearing, heart of the swamp has mild chances at good stuff, tea time... tea time........., camp fire tails has some mild chances at good rewards too, free range isn‚Äôt bad but it‚Äôs just kinda eh (never got a good reward from it, say otherwise if you have). Project paradise and radiation are the only other events worth hitting up, but running them solo is kinda hard and yeah no one goes to those. Personally I think it‚Äôd be cool if daily ops doubled as a public event, or just was a public event.
---
Haha thanks that‚Äôs saying quite a lot üòÅ
---
You won‚Äôt. Bethesda will tell you that they can‚Äôt disclose the results of their investigation due to privacy issues.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me also and I feel your pain with the rewards
---
I can post links to images, but it's annoying to not see them like this.
---
I really like having raider punk in my camp, but all of the other ones get on my nerves after a while. I feel you.
---
As long as we are on changes to the allies, now that we are seeing more and tougher enemies hitting our camps, I would love to be able to give better weapons and armor to the allies to help them defend the camp better.
---
I think I need to become a stoner.  Life seems much simpler for them.
---
This happend to me also.worst part was the guy seemed legit. It was on the trade reddit all went well I just took screenshots of the conversation like me asking him wtf just happend he dissapeared from the server.in the end he was added to a scam list but who checks the names on it?
---
Thx for the elaborate write-up!  My main is a bloodied commando who doesn‚Äôt use PA.  Biggest problem with that encounter is the freezing touch.  As a solo, with all attacks coming your way, it‚Äôs hard to not get slowed down to a standstill.  I think positioning in the proper location is important...just haven‚Äôt figured that out yet.  You must also be killing mobs faster than me so that this doesn‚Äôt happen.  Again, it‚Äôs not that i die a lot, it‚Äôs just that the slow-down effect they makes it hard to get it done solo under 8 mins.  The other encounters have been much more doable.
---
Oh ya it's not hard as melee just you'll get less xp from not tagging enemies. They really need to change it so if your in a team u get xp from.everyones kills
---
Hmm let me check mine real quick. I'm assuming you're using a bloodied?
---
That's if the percentagea are being added together before they're calculated against the base damage. 
---
Is something that throws me off a ton too when trying to decide on what gear to roll with in games.
---
But I'm an artist,  not a geologist. 
---
Check my art out at www.Studio-Aegis.com   :p
---
Doesn‚Äôt secret service armor prevent you from wearing legendarys though? It couldn‚Äôt possibly be an under armor could it?
---
If you are on PC, there is a mod that silences them (and optionally a LOT of other things like the musical instruments, singing vendors, etc.):

---
Question what system? If Xbox I will gladly drop stuff for your son.
---
Agree, but if I go a whole week without getting any rare reward with a supposed 80% chance, I‚Äôll believe it‚Äôs more likely that the drop rate is bugged. Really just hoping for the war glaive and it happens that my melee character can‚Äôt get a single rare drop from either group of rewards üò©
---
Solo or team?
---
Oh yeah, they would have disabled it for sure.  I've said that all along.
---
Yeah fo76 community is fantastic for the most part. We have a few bad apples, like anyone does. But for the most part the worst someone will do is ignore you. But a very large portion of the player base is always willing to lend a hand, especially if you ask for it (nobody's a mind reader). It's a big part of why I love this game
---
It‚Äôs only good with the explosive effect in my opinion
---
Just gave away 180 Stims and 50 Radaway to noobs because I already sold like 200 Stims and Radaway to the vendor bot..
---
My builds are all built around stealth. Luckily I have gear and perks lying around to respec quickly. I‚Äôve found that vampires autos and anti armor explosive 10mm smg are way more effective than my usual weapons. I also swap in more bolstering armor than usual. Trouble shooter and mutant pieces too. Swap out stealth perks for dodgy, ap regen, auto stun and sprinting perks. I can solo some of these with toons that are usually stealth commandos by thinking about how to rise to the challenge
---
Try grabbing Anti-Armor, and/or the 33% VATS Hit Chance Effect.
---
Tank Killer on its own isn't enough for a Lever Action against more heavily armored targets like Super Mutants, and the 33% VATS Hit Chance is perfect for always going for the head.
---
Platinum girl?
---
Ahh yikes. I didn't expect that.
---
Is it just me that thinks Dodge is the strongest voice actor in this game? Its only a few lines but they are delivered with Oscar winning emotion. Reminds me of Chris Christoffersons character from New Vegas
---
People dropped them because there was no better solution, because it was a crappy system to begin with. The reason we have scripping is because people complained about not being able to carry all the junk the game was throwing at us.
---
When u build the armour pieces (except helmet) they will have 1-3 legendary modifiers but they also have really good protection stats
---
Boost your Int and eat XP increasing food. Then grind the bejesus out of areas with high level enemies.
---
Yes! I‚Äôm a lvl 130 (on pacifist) and ever since season 2 came out I‚Äôve been randomly targeted by my own teammates. And yes, you can die and no, you can‚Äôt defend yourself in the moment (it asks after you die if you want revenge). Twice I was ‚Äòganged up on‚Äô while at a ‚Äòteammate‚Äôs‚Äô vending machine, once immediately after finishing One Violent Night, and once for showing up to a ‚Äòdefend _ workshop‚Äô event (after waving to a ‚Äòteammate‚Äô and walking away to kill liberators). It‚Äôs really disheartening. I‚Äôve been shot at before, I‚Äôve have never been killed by another player before this season. I do have the ‚Äòtake one for the team‚Äô perk, but I didn‚Äôt realize it translated to ‚Äòhey, come gun me down‚Äô. Guess I need to look into the perk more?
---
this \^ i run a bloodied commando but after i put on some damage mitigation perks ( namely followed angry turtle's updated commando build) the hardest part of the ops is remembering the quickest way to the uplinks lol
---
I‚Äôm still using the old enclave under armour with secret service limbs and torso
---
Not really...20% of 100 taken 3 times is 60.  60% of 100 is 60.  It works out to be the same whether it's added before or not.
---
But if they allowed us to fix it, it would've been 80% surely fixed. A small benefit of the doubt. Either way, this fuck up could-ve been easily avouded lol
---
XP is pretty pants anyway. The worst thing about melee is the trash ammo that gets dropped! Anyway, one day I‚Äôll get that glaive for my melee!
---
Weapons going up to level 100 be pointless. All it would do is make people re grind stuff they have for no reason. And if it gave dbl the dmg as a lvl 50 then the nerf would legit be made irrelevant which is dumb. 
---
Imo the nerf was 100% a good thing I stopped playing cus one shotting things is boring af. Power creep is a thing every mmo needs to avoid are else it makes getting new weapons and armor pointless which makes getting loot pointless.
---
Why grind this weapon if my current already deletes the game?
---
And the nerf wasn't honestly that bad for end game players my heavy gun PA build still shreds and is now unkillable due to electric absorption.
---
Weapon damage is fine. People got to used to steam rolling everything. I doubt beth ever intended that kind of damage
---
It's not great but it does all add up espically with Legndary perks in game gaining xp is what most people want.
---
My AA and TSE are both doing a good job of killing everything in 1-3 shots
---
No.  2 shot.  But either way these cards are giving so little effect there's almost no reason to use them.  Something isn't stirring the Kool aid right
---
Actually its 80% on your 1st completion under 8 minutes and 0% for all other completions on the same day, which based on my current luck I'd say is possible.
---
 Wall d√©cor ...
---
Grind the West Tek building, and daily ops. Sometimes I find up to 4 Legends in and around West Tek building.
---
when I was using my vanguard heavy gunner  I was buying 100% ones for up to 100 c each eveytime  I found them. would go through about 100 a week
---
Nope, didn't even bother to do any. I unsubbed and probably won't bother playing this game again. I just hopped on, did some events, killed some scorch beasts and realized they didn't fix a fucking thing in roughly 8 months.
---
Team.  I dont do ops solo every time I do 4 seconds later 4 of my friends come on and want to do it so i dont bother with solo
---
Hopefully that means more people doing radiation rumble!
---
Thanks! Unfortunately he‚Äôs PS4. There‚Äôs been a ton of generosity. And he‚Äôs trying to collect stuff to try and share. I appreciate it!
---
When did it get into the game!? With P22?
---
It‚Äôd be nice as it would help the in game economy by making duped/magic weapons worthless. However, it brings forth the point that duplication/magic weapons could be created for these level 100 weapons also. So essentially, Bethesda would have to face the duping problem that‚Äôs plaguing the game before they could make a move to lvl 100 weapons... I.e. don‚Äôt expect this level cap to be raised anytime soon. Fingers crossed it happens eventually though!
---
What's a sympto-matic
---
Rad rumble is my fav event. I always do it when it's up. So much xp and drops
---
For some people, yes. If you know what you‚Äôre doing and have good tactics. That comes more naturally to some of us over others. I‚Äôve noticed as I‚Äôve aged my reaction times have slowed. So I have to play with more forethought. So in my example, I had to learn from my first run to improve my second and third. 
---
You may be able to solo these on your first try every time, and that‚Äôs great. Your skill and reflexes are up to that task. 
---
But that‚Äôs not the case for all of us. Which is why it‚Äôs more challenging to solo the op for some, and why having a team can help immensely.
---
I like the Morgantown area. Fauna &amp; ghouls.
---
Most people are just that nice. Any time I see stuff at another players base I usually just absent-mindedly fix it. Seeing stuff like this makes you think about it though and that sometimes it can be a big help!
---
I explained it wrong then, would be more like 20 is added to the base, making a new base, then the next 20 is added to that new base, then the third making each percentage added less overall than the initial or some such.
---
But dont quote me on math, will just spread the embarrassment. 
---
XD
---
Mine not yours,  as I'm sure even this isn't exactly what's going on.
---
i can if you give me 10 mins.
---
I have the same ammo perks but recently started focusing on "so anyway, I started blastin'" lol. Usually with LMG and a Minigun so I am flying through ammo as I have been killing and moving rather than stopping to atleast loot ammo, etc.
---
booth that removes diseases. reward from daily ops. It's fucking sweeeeet
---
Isn't getting an endgame build a form of progression? One that would be op and make  your character a God among men?
---
" all legendary item now sell for 5 scrip each "
---
A camp item that clears all diseases. The plan is a rare drop from Daily-Ops
---
The thing is... level 50 weapons are sufficient to take out those level 100 enemies. All that would do is create a lack of balance and make every current weapon worthless.
---
Ops are still new so in a couple weeks everyone will have their way of beating it in time. But if they were to make it easier the less people you have the more time would probably be better imo.
---
Fudge I hope not
---
Save the light ones to script, and sell the heavy ones, unless it's a really good heavy one of course, then sell it at your vending machine. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices if you play a lot.
---
I've sure as hell never seen one but I bet it's technically possible a chameleon could spawn as a tamable.
---
I tried yesterday‚Äôs solo and boy did I fail big time. 20+ minutes, the stupid freezing robots were hell to kill and there seemed to be so many at a time. The boss would also kill me almost instantly. I do t know how anyone could do this solo on 8 or less
---
YIKES!!!! :D
---
I don't know why you think that's the case, for me it's the opposite: Usually ! Events like Line in the Sand - Uranium Fever - One Violent Night etc will have up to 8 people doing them. Granted most people now tend to do Daily Ops but the majority still do regular Events when they can. It's not hard at all, hell I've seen level 10/30s handle things better (Good on them) so it's not remotely as difficult as it's been painted out to be.
---
Yes, you are intended to. Or just to not pick up 1* super sledges/harpoon guns if you already have better weapons
---
Sure, just let me know when you need an invite
---
I do most that I see just for the treasury notes. 160.
---
That's a respectable time. Yeah, I drank the kool-aid and got Fallout 1st which allows me to consistently solo Daily Ops.
---
Nah. I‚Äôm PS4 unfortunately.
---
Because distinguished guests is one of the funnest events in the whole game.
---
Missile packs incoming.
---
Also, farm assault rifles and combat shotguns off of enemies and sell them all with Hard Bargain equipped. Welch is a good place to do this, there‚Äôs a gang of mole miners right next to a train station vendor.
---
I've tried it on all 3 platforms in terms of friendly players again this is just from my experince.
---
1:xbox
---
2:PS
---
3:PC
---
90% of players on xbox give out free stuff help out and generally nice 
---
Playstation pretty close to xbox but have run into few doinks.
---
PC was honestly awful experince for me. Hackers everywhere, stealing stuff with hacks. Nuclear winter is actual aids on PC if anyone says NW is better on PC they are 100% a hacker.
---
You have to manually trigger it. If you don't you'll be waiting a long time for it to pop up yeah.
---
VATS is useless.
---
I hit rad rumble and project paradise all the time knowing no one shows and I love it for all the XP you get. Go in there with 4 lunchboxes popped 25% xp relish 5% embrace, 5% leader bobble, and 15% inspirational along with 44 int walkout with 1000 score sometimes.  Rad rumble can be a pain to maintain it all the way through. The others aren't to bad but those are my two I go to always, and if encrypted pops I farm robots.   
---
Tea Time and Swarm of Suitors I will hit if I am bored or about to server hop for my xp runs. Personal goal of mine is to have 7 legendary perk cards maxed on my main before years end so it is grind grind grind.
---
How does 1st help u with ops?
---
Oh PLEASE yes... especially Cmd. Headache is SUPER annoying...
---
mortimer at crater and sam at foundation
---
It doesn't work lol. It used to be because of a chameleon/escape artist bug but that was supposedly fixed, it's either not, or something else is wrong.
---
Being detected for no reason from far distances even with insane amounts of sneak and agility.
---
Vats straight up doesn't work with a gauss rifle, you can sort of work around it by quickly going in and out of vats a few times and it fixes it, but this shit is super annoying and you constantly have to do it. it should have been fixed by now.
---
I think this is the ideal balance. It's difficult but possible solo. You are encouraged but NOT REQUIRED to do it with a team for the best rewards. That's something that the vault raids, project paradise, etc kept getting wrong
---
It's not bad tho needs some effects to really shine. I use mine to kill lower teir enemy's to save my 2mm gauss minigun ammo for big dicking it.
---
Did he have a wanted level? Last night one of my teammates went wanted after I told him I wouldn't find him a deathclaw for his camp and he had to do it on his own, and he came back to my camp and shot at my deathclaw which did some damage.  
---
I don't think he saw my Heavy Laser Turret though, which took him down in three shots immediately after he tried.
---
Don‚Äôt underestimate the swarmin‚Äô vermin!
---
Random loot, no legendaries or rare outfits. Some random plans like power armor ones.
---
Plans, junk, weapons, armor. Don‚Äôt think outfits. Nothing rare or unique. But it‚Äôs easy free stuff
---
This option should be behind additional ''window'' just in case someone  accidently picks that. Ammo should be sold from one single round (especially explosive ones) as well.
---
Thanks for the info
---
^ As a bloody boi; I really feel this. I used to just side-step with death - now it‚Äôs just full on dirty dancing and I‚Äôm loving it!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve got one that I use to one-shot the Queen. 
---
And by ‚ÄòQueen‚Äô, I mean the Miss Nanny chess piece in the frat house. Missile Launchers are such a disappointment in this game.
---
I've just been using the scrip to buy legendary modules and Vault Steel, better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. Maxing out Gold Bullion isn't bad either since they may utilize gold bullion in a future update.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it, a full Casual team is much more beneficial for doing the daily ops. You get a bonus for all earned xp, versus just what you earn from the daily op itself.
---
Right. I‚Äôve just conducted my test. I killed 5 level 100 Yao Guais with [my normal build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f8487b&amp;d=sb2pg2po2ph2pp2pi2e82em1eh2ce0cu2ib4ir2a70s72a12la2l71li2lt2). Each time I started with a full magazine, I had no active buffs and I was not in a team. Using a BE50 handmade in VATS from approximately the same distance every time my following results were in rounds to kill:
---
22//17//17//20//17.
---
Following the exact same criteria as above, with the exact same build as above minus demolition expert, I got the following results:
---
26//21//21//21//23.
---
This implies having rank 5 demolition expert saves me 4 rounds per max level Yao Guai. These results allow me to conclude Demolition Expert works, but perhaps not as well as I‚Äôd have liked. In PvP with a legacy laser rifle it‚Äôll make an enormous difference, especially since my other means of damage have been cut by around 80%.
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs not another Wastelanders situation where late in October it‚Äôs like surprise it isn‚Äôt coming out this year sort of thing but they did say in the ITV this week that they want to combine Steel Dawn and Fractured Steel as one update so that may cause some delays.
---
I run a furious Flamer on my daily ops. For some reason it seems to just straight up not be detected by the enemy's armor.
---
But they're almost always level 50, so are unusable by lower level players.
---
Just throw them.
---
Thanks!  It's maddening.  It only seems to happen if I get booted from the server and have to rejoin.  I'll do this going forward.
---
But that wouldn't require some type of grind.
---
It resets 1pm EST, not 12pm.
---
If the guy is a masochist, you just threatened him with a good time.
---
Sorry. Gave the last one to swords. If I get another I'll let you know.
---
Rumor only.
---
I‚Äôm quickly learning it‚Äôs the best part of the game. The community has been tremendous.
---
At least leveling is a bit faster, so we're getting to every fifth level quicker.
---
Free States because ***we were right all along fuckers***
---
Haven't seen anyone confirm it's actually happening
---
Used to get a ton of low level legendary before the patch, no clue how many folks get now. Even then they can still turn it in for scrip too.
---
I have three main builds (commando, pistol, heavy gunner) and only really notice the nerf on the pistol build as DPS was always lacking before the nerf, where as my commando and heavy gunner can still solo both the SBQ and Earl in around ten minutes. My builds have the best weapons and armour in game which a obtained through +2500 hours of game time and trades, I do believe the game needs a damage increase overall, I think raising the equipment level cap would do more harm than good to the player base, it would be like Bethesda saying ‚Äúyou see all that shit you spent countless hours grinding for, ye that‚Äôs all fucking useless now have fun‚Äù.
---
A change like that would make myself and I‚Äôm sure plenty of other players quite the game initially.
---
I was on a Daily Ops team that did the run like ten times in a row, just over and over, two and three star legendaries at the end of each one. In this game, legendaries are fairly rare, then you start getting them, then it's like a deluge.
---
&gt;I wish there were still some living Free States folks.
---
I do find it a bit suspect that we never found Raleigh Clay's body in the game full of dead bodies...
---
My problem is my highest level is 160.,2 are between 130 and 140 and my shotgunner is mid 70's. Got a minimum of a 140 level up grind if I stick solely to my melee build üò¨
---
Yeah, and for what? I could unequip all my damage perks and the difference would be... 3 more bullets to kill a random super mutant?
---
Stealth isn't broken. They all have piercing gaze which disables stealth.
---
Gt: rammadeus. 
---
you'll need to invite me to a private team. cannot build in public
---
Just received my rads smh
---
Bad idea. Weapons are strong enough now.
---
Interesting take, but I hate PA ( don't know why just do) and am nit a heavy gun. I guess I like to imagine a fallout where a rolling pin or pool cue could actually be viable. Appreciate your comment though!
---
i have most of mine for sell at 10 caps (i drop them if i run out of stash space), barely any sales ever
---
These are pre fallout 1 BoS, they're nothing like the ones in 4
---
I‚Äôve been throwing everything *including* the kitchen sink during the Daily Ops with so many enemies grouped together and yet I always end up, somewhere between the start and end of my play session, with more grenades than I threw to begin with.
---
Thanks for letting me know; I appreciate it.
---
I respectfully dont know if I agree only because look at the variety of weapons in the game. Only a small minority of weapons are viable now. Thanks though!
---
I know, feel free to put it anywhere. 
---
My camp is north of Foundation
---
I've noticed Instigating does a huge amount of damage now, my Instigating Guantlet with no perks invested, just 17 strength and brawlers arms one shots most mobs and 2 shots the rest, only heavy mobs require additional hits, if it had 40% Power attack i would basically one shot most mobs.
---
Anti Armor and Instigating have gotten a lot of love recently. AA &amp; Instigating for mobs, Bloodied and Junkie's for bosses it seems.
---
I run melee and I find it‚Äôs more use moving between uplinks taking out enemies on the move and when it‚Äôs boss time, get windmilling on fury. Contribution üëåüèº
---
(Cut to the end if you don't wanna do a lot of reading.) I run a Junkie's Unarmed build, was running it before the update and I'm still running it after the update. Unarmed will utilize any weapon that goes on your hand, which includes the brass knuckles and deathclaw gauntlet, others being the power fist, mole miner gauntlet, boxing glove, gauntlet (Foundation gold bullion), meat hook and bear arm (should be all but I might of missed one.) The new melee legendary perks are pretty viable and fun tbh, I run Retribution, Hack and Slash, and Exploding palm all maxed out and still kill stuff pretty fast. I also run maxed out strength and have my strength perks set up as Barbarian, Iron Fist, Blocker, Incisor and Martial Artist. Everything beyond strength is up to you. If your into vats I would say try running Gun Fu and Adrenaline in agility, with bloody mess and serendipity in Luck, class freak and starched genes are optional if your running mutations. Also makeshift warrior to keep your weapons going longer and Lone Wanderer if you run solo, switch for body guards if you running as a group. (Yes a bit of a long post but unarmed is still viable, and the legendary perks make it more viable.)
---
Yeah, well you saw how the Raiders walked all over us, and how Ward makes us go through torturous torment every single day for a shiny non tradeable shotgun.
---
Its Sheepman even better
---
I made a ghoul slayer baron viable against the west tek super mutants. Riflegaming and his crew completed the first daily ops all equipped with rolling pins
---
would say instigating 
---
ive got a bloodied and a quad .... both hit pretty hard on trash mobs ( 1 or 2 shot kills w/o any rifleman perks @ nerd rage threshold )
---
It's not the same glitch, the "new" one is extremely difficult to pull off. It requires a lagged out server and knowledge where a machine is placed, so when the target loads in the vendor uses the stash as it's source. And only until the camp is fully loaded in.
---
Hahah, I gotcha. Perhaps I'm wrong on the stars thing then, I'll look more into it. You go get em tiger
---
Can't you get dense mods and T-60 plans?
---
Man, that‚Äôd be a rad banner for the top of this subreddit
---
Today is pretty easy, fireproof or dense chest makes the explosions trivial. The burrows is kind of a pain though, things are so far apart that running solo cuts it close. I end up with 7+ minute times even when I start running to the next objective before the last one finishes and time it so that it finishes right before I get there. V94 can be bad because there isn't much cover on the generator in the bigger room and there's a ton of enemy spawn points in 3 directions around you. The mall or burning mine are the easiest, stuff is close together and you get at least some cover. Also seems like enemies take a while to get to you there. Marsupial and speed demon make everything a lot easier, but for v94 and the mall marsupial is pretty much required for an ideal run
---
Yes we did in fact know
---
This has been "passed along", together with the abysmal droprate, more than once.
---
I have given up on it.
---
Get a life,u choose to write this moaning crap here so shove it lil boy..
---
No problem. I also have game on PlayStation but am not on there much as I‚Äôm only level 10. But I‚Äôm glad ppl of the community stepped up and are doing the right thing. Hope you and your son have a great day.
---
Yea, the thing that annoys me about it is we own it in the atom store, just no ability to craft it, like it's something that I figure would be easily fixable, and they just don't feel like doing it. It's always the waiting game to get stuff fixed, always takes months when it should just be fixed in the next update (Especially with PTS going on.)
---
Yeah, I guess it's very tough to run and gun nowadays. Although I feel like that is more immersive, that the world is mean af. But it does get easier, apparently your level is around the toughest to play now. Go geddit bro, there's a whole world beyond that wall you're at
---
Go upstairs in the overseer's house and throw grenades in the corner of her office behind the display case.  Then hop on top of the case and with some fiddling you can sometimes take the outfit inside.  The helmet will blow out onto the floor.
---
Edit: sorry this may be a fire breathers outfit.
---
Yeah the moving truck was a nice touch
---
Yeah hopefully it will
---
Stash box and armor bench
---
Yeah the perk slots account wide but the perk coins are not. I‚Äôm level 340 and I won‚Äôt be able to fill my desired legendary cards until I am level 550
---
you mean you want to play this game without moma Beth sayin' its time to stop playing for the day?  :O
---
And some people still believe it's 80%.
---
That‚Äôs cool, I was there last week but it must have just changed.
---
Melee build with Rifle as my secondary - 13 PER with tank killer3, and level 1 of several of the other auto/semi perks. Bloody mess2. Maxed Glowsight. Take one for the team.   I think I also have demolition expert1.
---
I generally do not use foods or chems for increased damage.
---
That said, 
---
 From what sniping I have done, it really depends on the enemy.
---
I‚Äôve alternated between Supressors Expl Lever, AA Fixer, and Instigating Explosive combat rifle, both hip fire and scoped.
---
  The suppressors does better hip fire, the Fixer does better scoped.  Expl combat is on par with the fixer. TSE handmade, using the scope, seems to be about the same.
---
Yeah I agree
---
Or they prefer using a mouse and keyboard?  PC is great.
---
You're the first person ive heard saying you have to start from scratch. I would've thought going from XB1 to XSX would be seemless?
---
I use a focused vampire gatling against SBs.  IMHO, works really well in that application.
---
Nice.
---
I've had my JE laser rifle for a long ass time, and I've always been under the impression that demo expert didn't do shit for explosive energy weapons (with the exception of the gauss rifle).  Is this not the case?  Have I wasted more fusion cells than I've had to?  It's good to know that demo expert is in fact working for you, though.  When patch 22 dropped I had damage numbers on, and saw pretty much no difference with it, so I'll guess they fixed it when they fixed Adrenaline for the 277th time.  Thank you for your testing!
---
Oh man. I hope I stumble on your camp. I love finding cheap cores.
---
I got my Responder Fireman Outfit and Helmet from the 'Man Hunt' event. Be prepared for a looong grind to get it though.
---
Awww yeah, buddy!
---
i pretty much guessed that would happen, and it was still terrifying... :')
---
my pleasure
---
"Hold my beer....."
---
I was working on a Warhammer 40K model kit one day, it was one of the new Tempestus Scion kits that had the weird inch and a half mold injection spikes. I had tossed the empty sprue in the waste can as I worked. 
---
When I went to get up I did not notice that the cat had drug the sprue out of the bin. I stepped on the injection spike and it went into my foot, hit the heel bone, then shifted up the side of the bone before breaking off inside.
---
I've had a 6" deck nail go through my foot before and it hurt less then stepping on that sprue.
---
The way you talk about FO76 is like we are playing 2 different games completely.
---
I agree with your first point that combat should be a common strong point in all builds. However, combat IS the main point of the game, and that makes non-combat builds struggle
---
The second point, is half true. You dont need perks to play, but you need them to be barely efficient at killing something that is hostile. 
---
About weapon modding? Completely false. A fully modded non automatic weapon needing the whole magazine to kill a single "mob" if you dont have perks id say is pretty poorly designed in a game that has a focus in combat but needs resources to be able to fight.
---
Power armor is a whole lot of a mess, being a huge part of the balance issues that the game has had since release. Because utility, and resource sink, not defense, but nonetheless, umbalanced.
---
And now, the negatives with having to kill something in double the time. That means:
---
2x ammo usage
---
2x weapon degradation
---
2x probabilities to get hit and receive damage. Elevated for each enemy. Add to that healing items and armor durability
---
However, doing 2x the damage has only 2 bad things for all the positives:
---
In case you die, You have to go back and you might loose your junk.
---
Reading your comment, I think there is a MASSIVE breach on how players perceive the game. And I mean MASSIVE.
---
IDK which Fireman suit it is, but you can get one of them Upstairs in the overseers house.  Its in a display case. Toss a grenade, behind the case - it will blow the suit out of the case.  (Assuming BSG didnt fix it, anyway)  You might have to hunt for it afterwards, but it should be in the room somewhere
---
Nope nope nope nope nope !
---
Exactly! And the gutter (the assaultron blade type weapon) that u spend long grinding for, doesnt display on the rack even though it assigns it. Same with the assaultron blade (as i tried it out to check).
---
So bloody annoying.
---
My fancy revolver does the same as yours too.
---
I totally ignore the damage numbers and go by how many rounds it takes to put down something with a lot of health, for example a level 100 Yao Guai.
---
Switch to heavy gun build
---
Get a good mini gun
---
Spend all your caps on 5mm rounds
---
Spend 500 caps every 10 seconds
---
Cap problem solved!
---
Thats what Lewis &amp; Sons is.
---
ITT: Rich People don't realise they're rich
---
Most people if the deal is on that level.
---
The ppl that are against the weapon level going up is the ones that duped or paid real money for shit. I would love to see new weapons in the game, but I also for one love the enemies being higher level now also.
---
I believe there already is an armor bench? Either at the top of the mine near the restroom or right next to the hole you jump down.
---
I go out of my way not to spell propley ;)
---
I have also had several days in a row of absolutely nothing while completing the event at the Elder rank.
---
Apparently it‚Äôs related to the Raiders main quest and you go there briefly if you fail a specific speech/skill check. But the weirdly empty interior cell makes me wonder if they have plans for it eventually
---
In addition to being able to prioritize which healing item gets used when you hit the stimpack button, it would be nice if you could prioritize grenades.
---
Link? Or YouTuber name?
---
I'd like to turn off the vendors too
---
I hope more of these are coming in the future for other stats.
---
I almost feel like just straight perk coins makes more sense. It encourages people to interact with the new mechanic better than card packs do.
---
My son (age 12) and I both play, and I can confirm, the community (on X-Box) has been super kind and supportive to him.
---
Yeah lesson learned for sure
---
I was meaning to reply to this directly, not to you.
---
Which was my intent. 
---
Odd that some people didn‚Äôt get that. I was *agreeing* with the reply.
---
dont even need to stay alive.. just leave
---
This. You get a misc. quest at the end of Lode Baring that asks you to cash in your tokens every time you come out of a loading screen, except that it plays the wrong audio file. Cash in your tokens to shut up Ms. Melody Larkin.
---
Get to level 666
---
No worries. Those that can do the daily ops solo, that‚Äôs great!  If they need help, hopefully they find it. 
---
Even when I‚Äôve finished the op, if I see a spot on a Daily Op Public Team, I hop on to see if they‚Äôre in the op and I can join to help.
---
I'm thinking it is related but the note I'm thinking of isn't in the mine
---
If they do it should be about securing supplies or creating a supply route through somewhere.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Me and my friend also noticed we were playing with two separate balls
---
I yelped out loud when it happened. Those level 100 bears are tough!
---
any use or discussion of using a glitch is aban able offence with that new shit sheet we had to agree to.... even if its a glitch ppl like and  I bet 90% of ppl use
---
not complaining just warning watch what ya say some ppl will report ya for kicks
---
I was alarmed because I got notifications that someone was buying Psycho from me.  I've never sold Psycho in my vending.  It was priced at the same price I usually sell Stimpaks and my machine wasn't showing any Stimpaks, so I wondered if I was seeing a name bug.   As long as that's all it was, I'm not too concerned, but it's definitely odd.  
---
I've kept an eye on my weapons and armor machines, and those look fine.  I really don't have anything stashed that isn't in my vending machines that anyone would want.
---
If you don't have perks that aid you in crafting resources like ammo, AND you don't have combat perks, what perks do you have? I genuinely feel like the game gives enough options for players 
---
Gimme a build that you think is unplayable and I'll see see what I can do to improve it without moving perks around
---
I have the bloodied ffr Tesla with weight reduction and that thing shreds even my 2* junkie FFr
---
agreed! i've been having a lot of fun with the daily ops :D
---
I hit all I can - overencumbered (I now, my fault), but if one pops near where I am, I‚Äôll do it.
---
  I May or may not do Swarm of Suitors  - depends on if I need XP or the kill a huge creature challenge.    For whatever reason, if I solo it, it does not reward me T-Notes, but if there is another player, I get the T-notes.
---
I started a new character recently and cried when I saw all the treasures she was unthinkingly leaving behind in the vault.
---
You‚Äôve got too much time on your hands /s
---
I'm not sure, I didn't check the map to see if he was wanted or not. I was too busy mourning the death of my dear friend that I had for less than 12 hours lol.
---
If you're running "Taking one for the team" and were on a team, someone probably murdered you as you loaded in. Try getting a SSD

---
They may have been trying to exploit the new bug with the 'taking one for the team'  legendary perk. If you have the perk equipped (and are not in pacifist mode) you are able to be killed before PvP is initiated.
---
I'm on Xbox. 
---
Also how would someone kill me so quickly?
---
Whomst among us has never wanted to nuke a camp because it said their vendor had 15 weapons for sale and they were all non legendary?
---
He was next to my log cabin.  I don't know if falling off of that would have done it or not.
---
I do play in pacifist mode.
---
&gt;* Finally, we‚Äôve made several of last Season‚Äôs rewards, like Lunchboxes, the Ammo Converter, available at Gold Bullion vendors so players who missed them have another opportunity to unlock them.*
---
I read this as ‚ÄòGo see the existing Gold Bullion Vendors‚Äô, of which there are the three in game.
---
Also what's your problem with power armor? You can get one of the best sets in the game for free just by checking the military sites every once in a while
---
If only Bethesda had some way of letting players **test** these things, perhaps in a separate **server** available to the **public** before going live.
---
Nah Bethesda wouldn't do that üôÑ
---
Random i would expect but nothing twice is a bit much on 2 chars.
---
Thanks for your condolences.
---
Almost every other online game wouldn't have these daily limits in the first place.
---
 if that aint the most cringy shit i ever heard in my whole life. Hope its jus teenagers doing that instead of grown ass men
---
You do need the plans
---
Yes. I managed to get an unyielding cav ss leg from Colossal Problem just after learning the plan... saved me a lot of crafting!
---
When you switch to Xbox I will gladly help you out with stuff. I have both consoles and games on both. But I only recently bought it for PlayStation and am only level 10. I have played since beta on Xbox and am level 330. I will be buying Xbox series x first and later down the line PlayStation 5 when it goes on discount. But I will help you out when the time comes. Plenty of ppl will. Xbox community is what I know most and I know most ppl will help out.
---
Yeah, just like The Fixer, once you know the plans they can drop.
---
Can confirm this. I got a gauss pistol on yesterday‚Äôs daily op.  So I‚Äôm going to assume the random legendary weapon you can get is just like you get a random weapon from the purveyor.
---
Perhaps, but for new, casual, or low level players, the card packs are a system they need to know.
---
Ooo nice one lmao
---
i used to, but then the explosives nerf came and i dropped it like a sack of hammers
---
I was with a good (random) group; had I not gotten lost, I think we would have gotten it done it in under 8.  (We finished at 8 min 6 seconds.)
---
Bethesda Austin really is like an abusive boy/girlfriend. Everything we complain about they double down on.
---
Ive been following Shaxxs advice about throwing grenades from destiny. So I just tossed them at everything in daily ops last night actually killed quite a few with them
---
Aren't it berry mentats that mark enemies?
---
Very cool shots üëç
---
Ever since i equiped 'What Rads' i haven't even touched  a RadAway
---
You could use a macro program to toggle space bar with the vats key and only run it when 76 is open.  So every time you open vats it dumps your crits as they build.
---
You better love vats, that's the minimum requirement.
---
Don't really have a template, there's quite a few possible outcomes depending what your style of play is.
---
Grape mentals just increase your charisma?
---
I ment berry, fml editing
---
I think that‚Äôs the name of the female you can see at the scoreboard
---
How does that exactly work? I hold onto all my rares out of fear of being scammed, as well as being a hoarder in general
---
If you can get yourself an armor piece with the ‚Äúreduce damage while blocking‚Äù it makes it so your bats damage with a shotgun is huge. If you modify your shotgun to do enough damage, you can pretty much one hit most enemies. Get yourself a bloodied shotgun and you‚Äôre good to go. 
---
If you‚Äôre going for a build that isn‚Äôt bloodied or without magic weapons and armor. I recommend you get yourself a vampire shotgun. Most of the time you‚Äôll be up close and personal with enemies that will melee attack you or shoot you. So healing yourself while doing damage will keep you in the fight for a long time. 
---
Or maybe get yourself a furious shotgun. Shotguns tend to do good damage to begin with, so if you can get a furious shotgun and focus on that one enemy, you‚Äôll kill it no problem.
---
Fair. So maybe put perk coins later in the rewards list. Or don't replace all the perk packs, just some of them.
---
Realistically, if gold bullion isn't super new player friendly. If you've not figured out perk packs, gold bullion is way beyond your play level.
---
yes the community it almost universally lovely. people dropped things to me at lower levels, i did the same, and after seeing a memember of my casual team stuck with very low hp for a few mins, i popped over and dropped some stim packs off even though he was like 100 levels higher lol
---
Exploding Instigating double Barrell tend to shut them the fuck up.
---
Hah thanks
---
I‚Äôve run it on all five of my characters with 20 total Elder ranks and 15 total rewards. My wife has run it four times on her single character with 3 rare rewards. 
---
75% so far. So 80% sounds right to me. It‚Äôs actually a little higher than that since you get 5% and 10% for Initiate and Paladin. I‚Äôm sure the RNG will swing in your favor soon enough.
---
I think but it‚Äôs random between script and caps
---
This.  
---
I wonder if there's a certain amount of time between when it loads into the server and when it registers as a pet. Kind of like when you load into a server and it says you're overencumbered, because it hasn't registered your armor/perks yet.
---
My camp is in a very high traffic area (next to the overseer camp and wayward), so maybe it's possible the sloth spawned and was killed before it registered as a pet.
---
I might just take you up on that offer...
---
I always like to look at collections.
---
Heck,If ya got vendors setup,you might even get a cap or 2,Lol
---
Does Luck of the Draw work well at all?
---
Pvp is always quick
---
Not sure if its your cup of tea, but I have a B250DRWR10DWA lmg that's just taking up stash space. You can have it if you want it
---
Thanks, I will be on the lookout for a AA to add to my collection.
---
Hmm, seems really to be a bug then. If I don't forget it I will test it tomorrow.
---
its working for me.
---
I acknowledge that for my particular example, there's a side question of how important SS arms and legs are, if I already have pieces I'm reasonably happy with (2\* and 3\* Unyielding).
---
I‚Äôm assuming you know every gold plan, so why not just start buying lunchboxes to use at public events
---
I‚Äôm really glad that we get most of the workbenches inside the mine. But I totally agree there should be a stash box down there.
---
Negative. Gamma is radiation damage, only energy damage counts to proc the legendary perk effect.
---
Ye,the only reason I do em,Is for PA plans
---
Everything else Is run of the mill stuff
---
But he can check the blacklist to eventually confirm if that means anything  :/
---
its now a gold bullion plan (available at end of wastelanders quest line) from either mortimer at crater or sam at foundation
---
although for some reason this post has been voted down to 0 in a case of 'how dare you dislike our game' lol. reddit be reddit.
---
I just wish they would just let you drop them. Not trade or sell just drop them.
---
Sneak is working fine. You don't have your pip boy light on, do you?
---
Well, it's a small benefit but I can join the Daily Ops group but still do it solo (for certain).
---
I ment berry. I have no idea why I put grape, I threw an edit up after you commented
---
I think I might be playing a bit too much... I've started 5 months ago and i'm already level 268..
---
The DR/ER increases are nice, especially with Buttressed. 53/53 IIRC. 
---
If you already have good limb pieces, I‚Äôd craft a few SS pieces each day until you got appropriate replacements.
---
I for example, do use a full crafting/repairing build for everything I do. I have one for Weapons, another for energy Weapons, another for melee, another for armor, and another for power armor. Then I jave another build for general purpose crafting (like ammo/chems) and resource gathering. (Im level 120)
---
Then my main for going around I use a mix of utility/exploration/weight reduction, with only armor piercing/stumble/limb damage perks, no direct +X% damage.
---
Then, as wespons, I use whatever i have ammo for. Mainly Heavy, and switch to melee 2h when i run out of it or if im surrounded.
---
And with all that, the game still is resource intensive. The rubberbanding on enemy health means I generally have to use double the ammo I need. To get resources i need back up resources to be able to fight my way in and out of, not to mention defending workshops. And the whole needing 4 bullets to kill an enemy? I just dont have that. 
---
The 2nd day of Operations, the exploding bood eagles for example. I needed 30 rounds of Final Word (50 cal) to kill A SINGLE Blood eagle. Mostly of hesdshots. I was doing around 46 damage per shot. And i was getting back 6 to 12 rounds per enemy killed. I just dont see how people are killing in 1 shot everything and getting 15 shotgun shells for each enemy killed. Is domething I dont experience, and i have never expeeienced. Is like if the community is playing 2 different games altogether.
---
Thank you for the information! Happy to hear it's not as easy or frequent as the last one.
---
I always hit up uranium fever.  I often do tea time because its easy and i get ant meat for rad ant lager.  Lode bearing, i can stand inside the mine near the door and let the timer run out while i use the bathroom haha.  Swarm of suitors i like to do, mirelurk eggs make corn pone which ups the charisma.
---
I wasnt in PVP though. 
---
You aren't able to just light up random players. I'm always in pacifist mode so I couldn't have possible initiated the PVP.
---
Innovsurvivalist or juice head I think was changes to map on the pts server which we are now on.
---
Yes you can have them all but make sure to have starched genes so you don‚Äôt radaway them away
---
My guy it.... it... just isn't. But you enjoy yourself! As long as you're having fun. I just won't be there.
---
I have everyone but the melee ones and the plant eating one
---
Maybe 2 less dailies and one more weekly? Idk
---
I'm a lvl 37, relatively new to game (well, my hour count is now waay too high, FO 76 sucks you in!), but yeah.. Since the update I've noticed VATS is a steaming mess and thought I was mostly going crazy (as my ammo has been reduced to nothing). 
---
I don't use concentrated fire. It doesn't work. I use VATS a lot.
---
Instead of a Fatman or Artillery, I want a pumpkin launcher. I know this isn‚Äôt the focus of this post, but, pumpkins, ya know.
---
Thank!!
---
I agree! I have been enjoying the different mutations you have to contend with. And OMFG the spawns nevere end! I love the madness!!!
---
I always go to weird nuke sites. Constant Monongah and Fissure Prime is just boring.
---
given their old pro snap  daily/weekly challenges consisted of someone naked in a nuke zone or a super mutant behemoth and hound in the same photo, anyone who wants these back can go sit bare naked on a massive spiky cactus
---
Bethesda has confirmed additional weapons and armor being added later this winter in Steel Dawn/they updated the roadmap to reflect this and the addition of new quests
---
https://www.mmorpg.com/fallout-76/news/fallout-76-new-updated-2020-roadmap-released-2000119450
---
Awesome! I'm gonna make a new character tonight and run him through the quests and public teams to increase EXP gain to level him up ASAP. Unarmed looks really fun and you just sold me on it! Thanks! If you have a fallout build planner link, so I can get a good look at yours and start with a solid base for a build, I'd appreciate it!
---
In New Vegas it told you the total weight and value of a stack of items you were carrying... For example, if you 10 turpentine you would look at it and it‚Äôd say WT:20 VAL: 100. Each one weighs 2 and is worth 10, but the stack of ten weighs 20 and is worth 100.
---
&gt; but had an encounter with the angry Mothman
---
I'm pretty sure it was the cultist psychos who corrupted normal Mothmen, not the other way around.
---
I rarely go to West-Tec, but I have noticed that almost every marked location has a legendary spawn.
---
Admiral Ackbar is going crazy right now.
---
You need plans to see them drop. So being you got chest you leaned that plan you won‚Äôt get anything else until you learn it. I got the armor from events being I know all the pieces and I‚Äôve gotten the gauss weapons to drop. So yeah you need to know all parts to receive all parts
---
This mod is my saving grace. No more SWAAAAAARMIN VERMIN!
---
What do you mean, you dont want to hear about sophia lost floating in space?  Just, why?
---
Pretty sure there's an option in the settings to turn tips off.
---
Bro I think like the Raiders and Settler Ops faction stories and content ended couple months ago. There is unlikely upcoming stuff on them.
---
&gt;HAHAHAHA flamingo units?
---
A while back someone discovered that you can place exactly 500 flamingos in a camp. They then went through every item in the game, deleting flamingos until they could place said item, and calculated the number of "flamingo units" that each item takes in your budget.
---
They haven't updated the spreadsheet in awhile, but this will give you a breakdown of the FU costs for all the base game camp items.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item
---
If I recall correctly, they don‚Äôt like to work indoors, neither will they highlight a player that has crouched while your Berry Mentats were active.
---
Yea, can link what my current set up is in a few mins.
---
Hopefully Bethesda realizes this and includes either more card packs or straight up perk coin bundles in Season 3 rewards like the atoms, caps and scrip.
---
Yes, the plan is tradeable, and you can also build them at teammates' camps if you've learned the plan.
---
Here's my full health shotty/rifle build. You can substitute out the rifle perks or redistribute some of those Perception points if you're not going to have a rifle.

Just noticed I'm missing an intelligence point so that goes in gunsmith.

they will probably say some BS like they can't recover lost items
---
Solo: 7:37

Team: 6:15
---
Oh yeah I know. Sometimes I like to flex my cowardice and see how long I can hide.
---
SIR NO SIR! GAMMA GUNS MAKE RADIATION DAMAGE NOT ENERGY DAMAGE SIR!
---
Oh I know I‚Äôm mainly saying about ppl that say they don‚Äôt want higher gun drops. I saw the road map and I‚Äôm excited. Hopefully some of the fun weapons from old fallouts come
---
Brotherhood of Steel
---
Lol
---
Smart but weird
---
I would go Instigating, I feel Instigating got a secret buff. Or is buffed due to a glitch.
---
yes they do
---
if i don't check my inventory i could accumulate 300 radaway at the end of the week easily. Good thing is that you can get some good caps for those
---
Is just resource intensive with repairs, and power cores. Something I would dont mind, if everything else wasnt resource intensive. I was lucky to have some good trades with people, and a few drops from SBQ when i was able to do the damage threehold, but is not something sustainable. Also, the Power cores weight a ton. Add to that the lack of Serendipity which is pretty handy, no legendaries, no backpack, bad mobility, lack of mod variety and usefulness... You see my point? It dows have a nice defense, but you sacrifice so much for a marginal defense compared to a decent set of normal armor
---
I feel that. I play with one other guy and we just do our own thing. He's a pistol build and also uses power armor. I'm transitioning from a bloodied build to a Tank/bloodied hybrid sorta build. 
---
We've both been ratted on for not using X01 in nuke zones, or the fact that he uses pistols most of the time. So much so that the person leaves our team lol. 
---
The only thing you should worry about it having fun. If you feel like you're fine with where you're at, who cares what others say. I think it's really boring to just follow "what's best" instead of making your own game fun.
---
This whole thread was so enlighten for me. Thanks to the OP and all others for sharing your knowledge!
---
I hope they add more modifications for the weapons already in game also, because at the moment they‚Äôre sorely lacking. You can tell which guns were posted over from Fallout 4 cause they typically range from 20-40 mods per weapon, but new guns got a lot less work and received like 5 mods each. This is the Christmas present I‚Äôm hoping for BGS, make it happen ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Most of the score already comes from the dailies. Doing only weeklies will get you about 95,000 score - less than half of the 220,000 you need for the season.
---
With 1 more weekly per week, it would bring you to around 105,000 for the 10 weeks of weeklies. Still less than half.
---
With one more weekly per week, you gain 10,000 score.
---
In exchange, you are suggesting we dump 2x daily per day, which is 3,500 score per week - or 35,000 for 10 weeks.
---
It's a bad trade. 
---
Unless they doubled weeklies, it won't help a huge amount. And I think it's safe to say they'll never double weeklies.
---
SIR THANK YOU SIR!!
---
wait theirs a stimpak button
---
you can unlock power armour plans depending on the region they're in
---
Thanks. I hope it helps you and everyone else.
---
I don't, I just use the thumbs down button. People in Nuclear Winter usually understand what that means in my case.
---
What's it like playing with all the less popular ones?
---
I‚Äôm currently off the game for the above reason, but I really appreciate the offer.  If you really don‚Äôt want it I‚Äôll gladly take it and maybe trade my way up to what I lost.  I‚Äôll PM you the next time I‚Äôm on.  Thanks again
---
Check out the treehouse village. Its beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Haha, I had that happen once.
---
That's pretty epic. with some light editing this would be really epic.
---
Nice shot!
---
Wonderful, thanks for the reply!!
---
a lot of good advices here, but in general:
---
1) until your build is dialed in use stealth, like a lot. it saves ton of ammo because stealth gives big damage bonus on first hit(s). 
---
2) aim for head or basically weak spots. this adds another damage buf. "concentrated fire" perk allows to target head or limbs in VATS.
---
3) in vats you can do critical too, crits to head gets damage buf. 
---
4) gather materials to repair stuff at base benches. there are perks that can reduce repair costs. 
---
5) don't stick to one gun, switch between 10mm/pipe/melee etc. this way ammo is not a big concern. 
---
6) join public events, even high level one (public ones with exclamation sign are free travel too). just survive there and hit monsters once (so that it's tagged and will grant XP when killed by high-levels). you will get tonns of XP and sometimes 1-3 levels per event. plus legendary gear that can be sold for scrip and converted to new rolls at purveyor. 
---
all in all game is more hard right now yes but if know the tricks it can be easy again.
---
Yup, from now on the lowest level gear you get will be maximum level for said gear
---
I completely agree with you. It would be nice to see all the stuff from those games. It would give endless possibilities. Like I understand when they thought it would be a pvp game but it‚Äôs not. So we can have the other mods come and let us wreck havoc
---
Tea time is where it's at tho I do that every time I can it's an easy mellow event plus sweetwater is by boi.
---
I really do not want it. I've had it for probably 6 months and have never used it. It's all yours man. Just say the word next time you're gonna be on.
---
Yes, but good luck tagging them. 15 people show up everytime now. Lol!
---
If I saw a low level player who had their CAMP obliterated I'd help them rebuild too. The resources for me are nothing. For a level 30 though it's hours and hours of farming.
---
The event as it stands right now is only worth it if you have a pre-made group and not rando level 20s. Luckily there is a subreddit that runs events like this and radiation  rumbles that you can't find playing without
---
Ahhh that is incredible, thank you!
---
The last days the team leader would change the team from Casual to Daily ops before we kill the boss. Just clear it out with the members at the daily ops so they wait. After were done change it to Casual again it takes two seconds. I've also do this at event with a timer or sqb or earl. There i just chance it to the event team.
---
But yeah it would be nice with some mechanics for it.
---
I've only gotten rewards 2x so far and got elder every day. 80% my eye.
---
Lol looks like I might see about a group on a private server now, thank you for the heads up!
---
nuke whatever you want, what they gonna do?.
---
still queen have violet/crimson flux to make almost all the goodies
---
An colosus have all the others so in theory you should have enough flora xd

Yes it's possible but only a 10% chance to get 2 notes.

Star Trek Online, their daily things like that usually run on a 20 hour reset. Pretty handy.
---
but how do I get over the fear of going near baddies, they are scary as hell in this game.
---
Swimming in legendaries now just did leader of the pack to get my quick daily event score and got a max level instigating lever action
---
‚ÄûAlright let‚Äôs just boost the second uplink real fast ...‚Äú
---
Aaaaaaand I‚Äôm exiting my PA again. Thank you very much xXshadowgunner69Xx!
---
You're not missing anything. Intentional. Nice luck.
---
Yes.  I‚Äôve Been running with 5 mutations for IDK how many levels. - marsupial, healing factor, adrenaline, twisted muscles, and speed demon.
---
 Starched genes2 so you don‚Äôt lose them when you hit a radshower, class Freak 2 or 3 to offset the negative effects.
---
Use Diluted rad-away so the effects are not suppressed.
---
Also consider using a second serum when you find them cheap.  That way, if you do lose one by accident, (Forgetting to reequip SG after using super duper, then using a radaway was my oft-repeated error) you have can reacquire whichever one you lost.
---
I forgot those things existed until now... wtf didn't bethesda tweak them into an ammo exchange vs making a whole new item?
---
I've tried to do that one a couple times. No one else ever shows up and I can never find all the place setting things so I fail.
---
I got mine from a daily ally quest.
---
That‚Äôs why I was trying to keep the stats the same. Worst case scenario I just leave her in limbo until something changes.
---
As is it is I‚Äôm debating making my unarmed toon permanently a shotgun build since I already collected the cards for SBQ fights.
---
Sweet well now i know that i might try it more often
---
You can have 18 of 19 mutations active at any time (carnivore and herbivore being exclusive to one another). Class freak, Starched genes, and Strange in Numbers are must haves to fully optimize mutations though, so be prepared to get those!
---
[Red Spots on this map in the Mire and Bog are your best bet.](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) But definitely check different areas. The animal needs to be at least half your level, you need an unscoped gun (sights only), Animal Friend Rank 3. You do not need free camp budget to be able to tame but once tamed they will run to your camp in real time....just let it run and go do something else. I don't think a fox is a tamable though...sorry.
---
Yeah the plan is more of an insult than a reward
---
I really like Distinguished Guests too. Just fun to try and get it all done by yourself. Well, was fun lol
---
Have you tried telling *them* everything you just posted here? Sometimes, all it takes is a simple "no thanks :)"
---
If you use PA, mod the helmet for targeting hud. 
---
 It highlights living enemies ;)
---
Give us a book or something to boost intelligence
---
Take every perk card out and see what your dmg is at full health.  It should be between 40-50 depending on receiver in the handmade. Then add in just the commando cards. It should add in 24-30 dmg.
---
I have the frame and a few cores, any idea how to get more cores and the pieces?
---
On keyboards, it's H by default. On a console control, it's d-pad right.
---
I think the biggest problem is after the patch those damage perks don‚Äôt do as much as they used to
---
Sick I hope your scout master gives u an A+ or some psychobuff
---
I‚Äôm jealous, my main account finally got something today after getting nothing the whole week üôÑ
---
Only one roll per day per rank though :) make sure you unlock all ranks each day.
---
I will do that tonight! I can't wait! Thanks for the tip!
---
Why there is a difference between platforms? Do I understand correctly that every platform has its own server(s) and I as a PC user cannot interact with non PC users? That's so weird.
---
I wish I'd tried selling the plan instead.
---
Have no proof have just seen people on here mention it. 
---
Last time around I lost some very decent weapons and items so I‚Äôd rather remove the shops and not take the risk. 
---
Saying that I did pop mine back up today and have proceeded to just carry all my most valuable stuff on my person.
---
Just tried point 6 and holy hell was that a good call. Thanks bro.
---
I do not understand why it is not done with a slider bar.
---
Say a prayer to Todd and RNGesus above.
---
Which ones you referring too? So I got marsupial first. Because who doesn‚Äôt want to jump high. I got plague walker from having rads that one I can‚Äôt tell it does anything. Before it seemed to do something maybe the others dim the effect. Carnivore is fun being I always used the meat like ribeye steak and grilled radstag and then they upped the carry weight I received from those after season 1 dropped. Speed demon is awesome running fast. Herb mentality is good being it works even if in a group by yourself. I have the one where when I get hit enemies get a electric shock and fire damage. Sometimes that‚Äôs annoying. I have another one I haven‚Äôt used yet because I didn‚Äôt want it to take my strength down. I have grounded and chameleon I got I found in a suit case and I just took it since it was free. I prob am missing some, oh yeah adrenal reaction is a must for bloodied players. But yeah I prob missed some but they all have benefits. This is coming from someone that played at beta and took a couple month break last year but came back around October and still had a bunch to learn and experience. I just started the mutation and perk build couple months ago. I use to just worry about carrying stuff around. Then I started playing the game for the perfect build and I started getting the mutations
---
I‚Äôve done it solo a couple times. Recheck areas; the settings respawn.
---
You can, I noticed I got some today.
---
Gain some levels if you haven't already.  Higher level weapons sell for considerably more than lower leveled weapons.
---
Try Google. They have many good resources for finding what you need. Thats what I did for each material I was short.
---
Once you learn it you have a chance to get it as a drop
---
I feel you there my friend. My boy Caludius Rex has "ran away" a couple times. He just seems to like that spot near the Cranberry Glade so much that he has to go back and visit it to de-stress when the CAMP gets attacked sometimes.
---
Not to nitpick your build but instead of running one maxed card with 20% dmg, you could run 1 Star of basic/expert/master each and get 30% instead. Hope it helps!
---
Morgan Town high-school.  Supermutants tend to carry laser weapons.  Having scrapper gets something like 7 to 10 plastic per
---
Morgantown High School. 
---
Fort Defiance (not as much plastic as MHS but there is lots of other good stuff there as well).
---
How do you trigger it?
---
He's switching from Playstation to Xbox. You can't transfer your account/characters to a different platform.
---
I'm new.. (well, lvl 37) Flamingo Units, I like that :D 
---
Thanks for not acronyming anything in the title and sounding like one of the few acronym-speak (but can't speak proper English) trolls on here! STILL trying to figure out how CAMP units work.. seems like anything stored takes room too?
---
What I DON'T like is that a constant, new daily challenges in SCORE is this event, and yet its a level 50+ thing. Biases getting SCORE to only those over lvl 50 which I feel is really unfair to us newbs. Not going to rush through game to lvl 50 just to get SCORE.
---
Especially now that stuff breaks faster. Hmm..
---
Hahahahahhahahaha
---
It is a great weapon if you adopt this technique: pull, enter VATS, wait half a second, release.
---
My compound bow oneshoots everything from stealth. 
---
Forget about Dialy Ops with it, of course.
---
It is possible for a player to kill a tamed pet. Not long ago a player came to my camp and started tossing explosive baits at my sloth and it eventually died and then they started throwing it in my camp so I had to server hop
---
Wow I've been hotkeying them to 1 this whole time

Watoga Highschool Cafeteria

7:37 is a great time üëç

Yeah, but does the chance increase with the amount of data brought in?

I should have said ‚Äúswitch platforms‚Äù I‚Äôm currently on ps4 moving to Xbox series x
---
You're really just kneecaping yourself.  But I guess if you just want to be weaker with no other benefits, that's your choice.  But don't complain about the game being hard if you do decide to kneecap yourself.
---
It would have been faster had I navigated better.
---
Do you mean when your character randomly staggers as if they were taking damage? That‚Äôs a clipping issue from terrain and has been around since the game released (please fix it Bethesda)
---
Im keeping mine for when the collect X caps challenge come back around. Easy money.
---
Not really, but someone here does post the Daily Challenges. I can‚Äôt recall their username but if I come across it I‚Äôll tag them.
---
No, and whoever downvoted me is a dickhead. Stealth and vats have been bugged for a year and still are. I'm a bloodied unyielding Sniper with one piece of chameleon, it is literally impossible to have higher sneak than I do. I know what I'm talking about.
---
All I want is to be able to play my character without constant glitchy b.s that ruins the game.
---
I don't think so unfortunately. I think you just gotta keep turning it in whenever you're prompted to and hope for the best. 
---
Sorry I couldn't give you better news!
---
&gt;If I recall correctly, they don‚Äôt like to work indoors
---
Didn't know that, I just started trying to use it to find Earl's hiding ass
---
Thank you, I‚Äôd appreciate it
---
Or maybe just give more coins per card :thinking:
---
You better make it obvious that you didnt mean to hit them otherwise when you miss by a haif you get so many messages commenting on your failure.
---
That explains why more stimpacks were auto used up with robots in daily ops and AWOL than anything else.
---
On the other hand, they are military robot's, what did you expect, rubber bullets?
---
Read [this](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) and bookmark if.
---
I would have so many questions as to why anyone would bot a game where your inventory is always being crammed with legendary items.
---
Seriously I don't need them, all I want is copper and nuclear material to make ammo from.
---
As it stands I can solo two scorchbeasts and a mirelurk king with what I've amassed so far the only things I want really are just mods for my power armor and weapons. Most of which you can't actually just acquire from events/questing anyway.
---
Nope, I run the perk and still get the teleport
---
Whitespring
---
Cool, thanks for the tip.
---
Nice work!
---
Stacks of .38 ammo and pipe gun mods incoming.
---
The freezing bots  were by far the worst for me. I thought you could only get frozen with mele but I swear the bullets would freeze me too. And it seemed like there were way more enemies than previous days.
---
It‚Äôs u/WorkablePuffin. Check his posts.
---
If you get elder the first time, you are done for the day.
---
Yah. I unhooked vending. Still camp icon gets grated out. Ally ( Beckett) still not working after patch 22.
---
I can't remember if that happened patch 20 or 21.  But I noticed it a few weeks ago.  Curious what it place will become.
---
I've also experienced a sort of stagger when I become not well-fed/my chem runs out/etc. It seems to be tied to losing a status effect for me.
---
Yeah. Noticed this in the glass caverns, Big Bend Tunnels, Poseidon Energy Plant, pretty much anywhere you need to go through a loading screen to get at except outside.
---
*Looks at the extremely pixelated, unrealistic ripples in the water*
---
I have too many technical notes, and since i can only use one at a time and I need to find one to get the quest I literally can't do anything with them. 
---
If anyone on PC wanna trade them one by one at the terminal so we both get quests msg me.
---
EDIT: I have so many because I collected a bunch before finishing the quest that unlocks the possibility of submitting the data
---
I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks for the math dude
---
How many times does bethesda have to tell people it‚Äôs not meant to be played solo?
---
No.I crafted mine after the update and could finally mod it to shielded.love it with thorn armor and in NW.ps4 tho.
---
AKA the scavver's Bible. üôè
---
I‚Äôm not entirely sure then, I‚Äôve never experienced that specific problem but hopefully it gets resolved soon if it‚Äôs affecting Daily Ops as well
---
That‚Äôs helpful! I‚Äôm learning and that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Swap out all your sneak related perks for damage mitigation ones. When reloading take cover to avoid being hit. Keep your AP regen as high as you can get it for doggy 3.
---
I feel like there are two kinds of people, one, the kind who avoid all punch bowls and cola machines because they don‚Äôt want to get Nukashined, and two, those who don‚Äôt care and drink from all of them. I am number two. Apparently everyone who visits my camp is number one which is sad because I dont have Nukashine in mine, just rare alcohols.
---
Thank you!  I‚Äôm not having much luck on these. Will take any advice I can get
---
It would be nice if event rewards would scale a tad with your level - getting 198xp @ lv 451 (low Int build to be fair) for completing collision course seems low.
---
Not wrong!
---
Sorry dude, not my responsibility to remind people others exist and to be decent humans. I just ignore the messages because it's also not my responsibility to reply to someone. ‚úå
---
Edit: I'm talking about invites and messages from randos. I don't team with randos. On xbox, replying to a message is all anyone needs to trace your IP. Not my responsibility to reply to an unprovoked message just so they can be told "no thanks" and they can trace my IP.
---
Have you tried cheering it up?
---
Get yourself an executioners pump shotgun and have a friend mod it for you. Pick some shotgun perks and concentrated fire and you will be fine. It works really well!!
---
Grafton Steel and scrapper perk card.
---
Gah, Acronym-talk ppl. Makes it hard for us Newbs. I can understand 1/2 of what you're saying (TSE?) ..   
---
Do these guns still work with VATS now broken?  
---
I'm lvl 37 and just found my FIRST Railway rifle last night.. Excited. Just steel for ammo? Nice. Saving all my scrip for lvl 50.
---
Yeah the stagger one it seems to be amplified when I‚Äôm in Daily Ops run. I still have them outside of DO but wayyy less.
---
Instigating, after some testing (I have every lever you can think of) still oneshoots almost everything. 
---
Bloodied is not that good anymore. Antiarmor lever is good, but too slow if there is more than one enemy. 
---
I great results with a Stalker's Explosive. Lots of headshots and oneshooting too. But instigating rules. 
---
My main rifle now is a silenced instigating lever, one star. And I have Bloodied Fixers, Instigating gaussess, etc.
---
You can request a courier - there are a lot of folks out there who act as middlemen during trades. Each person gives the item to the courier, who then makes sure the right item goes to the right person.
---
You usually tip the courier a few hundred caps.
---
Is 1 reserved, or can you remap 1 to something else, and remap quick heal to 1?
---
When I gave keyboard/mouse controls a try, I was frustrated with it and just going back to console controls. I recall wanting to remap things, and being unable. I like to remap a lot of things to thumb-accessible mouse buttons, like grenades and heals.
---
Yup!  And they keep it updated as well.
---
It has to be a random encounter. There are certain spots that spawns it. And you just need animal friend rank 3
---
That sounds like your fault. Nobody trades dozens of legacy‚Äôs for a few weapons
---
Another piece of advice to PA users, stay a bit back if you seem someone else activating an uplink/repairing the signal transmitter. Your hit boxes are a lot larger than a regular players so if you get too close it covers the transmitter and you have to begin activating it again. Not a huge issue, but can cost precious seconds if you‚Äôre going for an Elder run
---
This is why I just removed my ally all together. She wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about her headaches that I got cured several months prior.
---
Yeah. I thought so. I would suggest that it may not be another player's responsibility to be considerate of your preferences of playstyle unless they choose to, for the very same reason.
---
Your message is: don't tell me how to play, world.
---
My message is: try playing only with people you want to play with.
---
Actually, the particular gun the guy made for me was a lever action, significantly weaker than my 3 star anti armor rifle. He just didn't like how slow it reloaded.
---
4 locations but for now yes.
---
Burrows
---
Shopping Center
---
Burning Mine
---
Vault
---
What‚Äôs today‚Äôs one? I have not been home after reset and will run it after kids and wife goto bed.
---
You can have more active at the time!
---
Fallout should have craftable grenade bolos. That seems like something someone would do in Fallout.
---
That's not new.  I used to make jokes about how my 20-sided is weighted to always roll a 1 when it says that I have a 95% chance.  
---
(BTW: "always" is an exaggeration.  It only happens on occasion, but there are times when I feel like it's "always".)
---
I‚Äôm just explaining to op how it happened to me. Wasn‚Äôt even trying to prove u wrong.
---
On the 3 occasions I've played this week I have seen a total of 6. Two at the scorched earth event (including the Queen) and 3 were at the wolf pack event. Just 1 in the wild and I've visited all the 7sual places too.
---
This is way less than usual.
---
Now that I‚Äôm using more ammo, I invested in legendary strength and added Bandolier.  I pick up every bit of ammo that falls under that card now.
---
I‚Äôd avoided the converter until p22 went live, and the UI is not great.  It‚Äôs designed for hoarders.  If you want to use it to convert whatever random ammo you happen to loot on a Westek or Burrows run, it‚Äôs horrible.
---
Like learning to drive a car with a manual transmission, you get used to it.  It‚Äôs clunky, but you learn how to use it efficiently.
---
I don‚Äôt see them simplifying the UI, so I‚Äôm just going to learn to adapt to it as another ammo producing asset.  I think the design is to prevent duping or any other exploitation that seems to be a huge problem with vendor style interfaces.
---
The appropriate legendary armor set goes a long way.  If you don't have that, then slap on some power armor until you can put a set together.  Emergency protocols on the PA chest is also nice to have.
---
That'd be awesome mate happily buy it from you.
---
No there isn‚Äôt that I know of. But just look on here and maybe someone will have it posted
---
Burrows super mutants
---
Do you have a hunting rifle
---
Is it freezing exploding or what?
---
They changed the lighting in the DMV to be darker, and now you can hardly see the berry mentat effect.  They are also now pretty useless in dark areas of whitesprings cottages and in some areas of westek.  
---
They worked fine before the update.
---
I‚Äôve noticed pretty bad staggering in both the Burning Mine and Vault 94, because they have more haphazard terrain so the navmeshing isn‚Äôt as great. Valley Galleria hasn‚Äôt had any issues for me though cause it‚Äôs a lot smoother terrain so there‚Äôs less invisible entities for your character to hit
---
Yeah sometimes mine are showing and sometimes not, most of the time they are.  I notice it more with ghouls than other mob types
---
Today I sold 300 of the 400 radaways I somehow accumulated and my next board space is the rad kit... So exciting...
---
I got u. What‚Äôs ur gamertag? Don‚Äôt have a mic tho
---
Wow, this thread really went off-the-rails from a lvl 15 wanting to talk about the issues he's having .. :P
---
I have randomly made a grunt sound and also stagger for a long time. Doesn‚Äôt happen all the time but does happen often enough
---
Exploding
---
Depends on where you are.  Some areas became darker with the update and the BM visual effect is greatly reduced.  The DMV is the worst.
---
Oooo that‚Äôs another event I‚Äôll have to start taking advantage of. I‚Äôm also swimming in legendaries, I seem to have a hoarding problem. Congrats on the lever action!
---
I strangely have never had trouble with these, and do play bloodies with explosive weapons. I just make sure to jump and fire down, or just blow the pack up with hack and slash.
---
Main issue I have is finding the last one when doing a workshop defense event. When I'll just pop a Berry Mentats to find them.
---
Season 3 just gonna be all nuka shine radaways and stim packs until 90 on the board oh baby then you unlock the real stuff.
---
Can only do it for so long before cap limit and nothing to spend those on. Raising scrip limit would solve both the excessive amount of legendaries and the excess caps that could be spent on cheap legendaries in player vendors.
---
I started today, for the first time, play with pistols (level 430) i wanted to do the challenge kill 1000 or so, robots with pistols. I changed my build and started. Oh my god! So fun!
---
Vampire heavy ffr weapons are fantastic for daily ops, especially when they have no spin up.
---
Ok so that's a thing lol. I was trying to figure out why I would hit someone with my shotty and I would see like over half their health go away and then just go right back up.
---
Yes and no. I agree with people saying everything is a grind but I fear that if they even moved it to 3 coins, we would have people saying 'Bethesda, I already maxed my legendary perks out, you guys suck! we want more perks!" 50coin bundle in the rewards would be enough to rank one up or get a good head start to the next rank of another card while still not helping you max out everything immediately.
---
But the information in that link is actually true...
---
Back when the ammo converter came out it was bad and people here on reddit asked them to change it. Bethesda said they listened (But not really) and changed it to something equally frustrating to use. People asked again for them to change (or rather fix) it again. This time Bethesda didn't say anything. Soon the posts about fixing the ammo converter dwindled away. Now we get maybe one a day. And the reason behind that? In my opinion, is because the player base lost faith in Bethesda to actually do something about it. Back to back failures even after a "fix". At this point I dont have the faith in them that they will fix it and even if they did, they would probably screw it up even further. -An angry rant.
---
This daily ops is not only fun but I‚Äôve profited immensely off it, getting bundles of ammo and also swapping plans for an explosive plasma, this game mode has for me injected a much needed fun factor like dungeon runs from other mmorpgs
---
I think I misunderstood what the other poster was saying.... he was going from playstation to xbox.   Sorry.
---
Yes, a Lvl 37 here. THIS. 
---
Recent update made the game much worse, was a challenge before. I like semi-autos/bolt-actions. Sad for me :( 
---
Ironically, was also considering a melee build ;(
---
I mean mini nukes do quite a bit of damage now compared to other guns but they still weight too much and break easily.
---
Daily Ops kinda annoy me as a Melee character because all the enemies are range and I have to stay by the thingy for it to fill progress bar. If not for that I'd fully enjoy them.
---
I'm trialling a new idea- all four obviously sit on the same uplink and I'm hammering diffusers as we are packed tight for a change. Why not heals the feels while everyone (myself included!) is driving off the hordes? 
---
Only kill what you need too. Uplink to uplink, then incoming boss and done. Diffusers are optional but I'm geared as a part-medic and use Squad Manuevers to sprint from site to site so it's working for me as a former stealth sniper who lost his mojo during the patch. I run commando fully auto now with Tank Killer on a Quad HM. 
---
Im getting 6min runs regularly. Usually with 3 or less peeps.
---
shotgun works just fine on my 2nd char for me at least. I uses bloodied both shotgun and heavyguner but mainly heavy gun also mostly in power armor with emergency protocols on the torso. should still work with only shotgun if you going for that.
---
here my perk build im on right now for reference. \[not complete slowly working on it while lvling\]

im using perkloadout mod to easily and quickly swaping from heavyguner to shotgun perk even in mid combat. pretty useful

if power armor is not your style then just ignore this comment :)
---
The community just awesome
---
Haha all good man, did just do some searching and didn't find anything, ngl worried me a bit
---
It doesn't even whistle!
---
They really just need a soulbound icon for stuff like this.
---
Its essentially what these sorts of items are its just that the term itself doesn't make sense in this world's setting.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I made that joke to myself today.  I imagined the Overseer walking over to me and saying something along the lines of "C'mon now.  I've seen you in combat.  And I can smell the Grape Mentats on your breath every time you walk in.  I'm on to you."
---
One of the kids that I'm teaching from the wasteland(Toxicllama12492) to play, brought me the plans last night... God bless her!!!!!! 
---
Thank you for the heads-up  about the plans. It was the last thing that Earle wouldn't drop for me. His heads!!! Lolüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
---
Try an auto railway rifle. Super fast high damage and easy to make ammo.
---
You never see Earle that clearly. Great job with pic!!
---
If your luck is like mine, you'll end up with 4 of them before getting any of the cool plans like the symptomatic, the solar panels, or the reactor
---
Missed mine today but had to go to work
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing players logging out and making me fall to my death from their high-rise bases. Yesterday there was a guy waiting around to pick up my junk, but somehow I survived the fall.
---
As someone who actually uses missiles, 40mm, and mininukes, I kinda hate you for taking them just to convert them, but you are correct.
---
I'm not too sure, i played a lot of fallout 4 with default keyboard and mouse controls so im pretty used too them
---
You can get elder solo. Did one on my alt cause noone teamed today was 7:53. It's actually easy when you have a good build that can one hit the mutants.
---
Sprint and stay at the points is it. Boss can waste seconds if he spawns in a far away spot, but that's rng.
---
Add my builds are full health. The alt think is \~lvl 240 so it's doable by anyone.
---
thanks, Taac.   I'm relieved too
---
Hou cant let the queen spawn to get good rewards. You have to keep her from spawning by fighting off the waves before they reach the island. That's why your not getting treasury notes
---
Fox is not a possible tame
---
Btw do you need a mask for full set legendary cards?
---
Yes, THIS. Lvl 37 here and same issues..
---
I'd say I've had more if im honest.
---
He's just mad I kept the gold all to myself after stringing him along.
---
Also don't let the server boot you seconds before your team brings down the last enemy. That sucks
---
We give acronyms to legendary effects.  TSE = Twoshot + Explosive.  Same with BE and JE, Bloodied Explosive/Junkies Explosive.  But yes, vats works fine with the railway rifle.  It's a few specific guns that have it awful and barely ever work, and an occasional bug where you miss at 95% in vats (which can be kinda-fixed by exiting and re-entering vats).  Avoid vats with the gauss rifle, gauss pistol, and any weapon that has hold to charge.

I can't see it being remotely viable. I tried using it on my stealth build pre patch and it was terrible. Great gimmick weapon clearing out Wixon Homestead or Morgantown Airport but you wouldn't take it on down to anything serious. Especially now.
---
We all dreamed of being a Katniss. However we all ended up being useless like Prim.
---
I wonder why people stopped using bows and started using machine guns irl too.  Interesting question.
---
Two days in a row here, ranked elder on every single try.  No Rare plans.  At this point I‚Äôm just doing ops for the daily and xp, I don‚Äôt expect to get any cool new items from it.
---
Good point about the Spin up.  I have been using a Guass Minigun and that spin up annoys me.
---
No problem.
---
My message is very clearly: don't try to force me into your ideal of how to play the game when you are going out of your way to ask me to play with you.
---
Don't put words in my mouth just because you don't want to read and comprehend what I actually wrote in my own words. 
---
Also,  I lost my mic and rarely played with it anyway. The easiest way for anyone to track my IP on xbox is just by replying to their messages. It's literally for my own safety to not reply to the majority of messages I receive. Thanks for playing.
---
That was the first thing I tried when I started the game.  (Note: I started in July, so Wastelanders was live).  First thing I did after the stand-off in The Wayward was loot everything she had that wasn't glued to the floor and sell it back to her.  I still do it for old time's sake when I visit.
---
It‚Äôs all good, thanks for the offer though, it‚Äôs a fun little toy that‚Äôs for sure
---
I usually only do it for the stimpacks
---
Yep, its a clunky useless POS.
---
Everytime I use it i'm reminded how terrible it is and give up.
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
Nice thank you. Can‚Äôt wait to destroy them mother lovers
---
I feel the exact opposite to be true
---
I always liked uranium fever. Now I freaking love it. Great XP and leveled legendarys. Same with one violent night.
---
They're not that noticeable when they're moving.
---
Here's my current build (Some of it I'm working towards, mainly when they decide to take hunger/thirst out as not being need to be done and just as a optional thing.) Some things can be changed around or are just your choice if you want to use them or not. (Like Moving Target, could be replaced with Action boy or something else.)

# Can i stop getting these !
---
Then lvl 69420!
---
I started dropping legendaries (especially the heavy and useless prefix ones) just for more inventory space, and I purposely drown myself in rads and use radicool even though I'm not bloodied just for the increase in carry weight. No room in my stash for them even though I'm constantly doing inventory management. And I started buying serum recipes that I'll never use just to have something to blow my caps on. I never thought I would struggle with being rich, but here we are.
---
Daaaamn. Of course I finally got the plan to drop...but not on my melee character
---
I'll run with you again in a little if your still on
---
That sign was on the other side. You can kinda see it in the last photo here -  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/htsxwb/my_train_car_diner_camp/
---
Wow no spamming, a line?
---
You can still craft and mod low level gear, and leave it for them
---
Ooooh snap :D
---
I know.
---
I'm always swimming in junk so anytime I come across a,wrecked camp I'll always repair everything. Half the people whose camps I fix probably never even know they were wrecked in the first place.
---
Hi! I play on PS4 and I would love to visit and drop off some materials for your son. I just sent him a friend request (my PSN is the same as my reddit user name) 
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a while I can promise you that it‚Äôs rare to see bad players trying to ruin the fun. I hope your son doesn‚Äôt get discouraged and all of the replies are pepping up his spirit :)
---
Nope, not tradeable.
---
I mean seriously.  I would kinda be mad if someone with a bow could do as much dps as someone with machine gun.
---
It's fine to play how you want.
---
My only exception is if you join a Daily Op and run a sub optimal build then atleast be an uplink booster. I think everyone can contribute to team play with whatever build they like. If you're a damage dealer cool, you may need to compensate for this persons lower DPS, however my expectation is that the 'weaker' player is on stimpak duty, moves quickly from uplink to uplink and contributes DPS as best as possible, and that's good enough for me. 
---
Last thing we need is elitist attitudes in here. Given the shit our game gets from the world the community needs to stick together and encourage some diversity.
---
Youre welcome. They do look badass.
---
Still reads like a long way of saying "don't tell me how to play the game". 
---
To bring this conversation back full circle, I'll end with this: don't tell me how to respond to Reddit posts :)
---
I've got loads of plans when you get over hit me up ill don't you out. And I've got mules full of weapons I can drop you to help.
---
Same here, it's a good amount of challenge but at the same time you don't walk away from it drained of resources like you do with most of the other challenging events in this game. I'm pretty much net neutral on ammo, but I come away with 10+ stim packs every time.
---
Sorry you had such a bad time on PC, and a bit surprised. Lvl 175 here, not once saw a hacker, never got griefed or harrassed. All interactions have been peaceful at the least, helpful or just awesome.
---
Granted, I don't play NW. Like ever.
---
To throw my 2 Cents in, OP, when I visit a camp being attacked I often times repair little stuff the npc 's manage to break. Never witnessed a Player breaking something in someones camp. Maybe I' m just very lucky but the Overall verdict seems to be, this is the most awesome community I ever played with
---
Maybe you put the future camp skin? I build my new camp with the skin on, and that created problems. Half of the times my camp is grey and players cannot fast travel and my ally stays in one spot, usually far away from his item. I scrap his item and change him regularly, just to put him close enough to my camp and take the sleep buff. I have a bed and i move it around, just to be close to his location. I don't want to rebuild, just to uuequip the camp skin.  can someone tag the community managers to see the post? (I am in mobile)
---
Is there anything specific that I should save the bullion for that's a must have item?
---
My advice:
---
* get a Tesla (Two Shot preferably)
---
Seriously, now that it's not broken its worth it. With automatic barrel, it melts down everything and super effective against groups and in daily ops, you get waves of those groups while on the objective.
---
No, it's an actual stealth field like the Chinese stealth suit. There used to be a conflict between it and escape artist causing both of them to not work. It was apparently patched but I'm still having problems so I doubt it
---
Feed the people and Path of enlightenment reward you with bonus XP buff or 3-5 non perishable food items that offer bonus XP. Both very easy but usually you need a 2nd player. It is mind boggling that I can‚Äôt beg a member of a random INT group to come to help each other shorten the grind.
---
Yeah I have on the future camp skin is that what‚Äôs causing problems wow
---
Saw Shroud stream this a couple days back, he went with all bow perks. After using it, he dropped for one of the starter quest pistols (no perks) xD
---
I'd say 2x fill if your solo- enough to make it faster but not where people will prioritize getting solo runs over team runs. You still want a team to be better than solo and affecting enemies will change that balance
---
We are getting excursions next year. They were supposed to be this year but that got postponed, so probably gonna be early next year. They are outside the map adventures that will be like that (sort of).
---
That's a good point that, as a strictly ranged player myself, I would have never considered. I wonder if they'll rethink that. All they'd need to do is increase the area you need to stay in so melee characters have a little more room to work with.
---
You can check the market. If it's tradeable it'll be on there.
---
I purposely avoid them as to not be a burden. I really have no interest in them anyway. I also avoid scorched earth events most of the time. Unless it's just run around reviving people and get some hits on the queen.
---
God I often forget how long it took to farm ammo or supplies back at low levels. I only have played my main account since launch, so I often forget the struggle back then. I recently bought game on PlayStation also so I could see what the community is like on there. And also hoping it goes cross play on consoles, but being I‚Äôm only level 10 on there I am reminded of how tough finding stuff is.
---
That is the best NW challenge! It's very easy to do and that is why it's the best.
---
Right? The ammo and med vendors that no one ever uses. Ok maybe once I bought from one. I felt like it should accept ammo from day one of beta. Sort of a "take a bullet, leave a bullet" sort of thing. 
---
Whateva as it is they just a vestigial left over, with a very poor excuse for existing, that no one would notice if they were deleted.
---
Yh that makes sense
---
A weapon skin for the rolling pin!?!?
---
Get a shotgun.  Will change your life.
---
automatic bow gun
---
Right!I have to grind but I want to fast travel without knowing where I'm going! Plus rank over a 1000 to rank up my legendary perks!
---
It's an anti armor hunting rifle. I did eventually get a legendary lever action and use that sometimes. It's a ghouls slayer tho, but it's nice for the fancy skin I have for lever actions lol
---
He got it!  He had the trembling voice yesterday and was a bit discouraged. He was happy that someone helped him rebuild. And he‚Äôs been ecstatic at getting new friends. He‚Äôs coming to say ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù
---
Yes I‚Äôve been having a blast and it‚Äôs a super quick and easy way to farm legendaries, love it
---
Boy do I have a YouTube video for you
---
It's bugs. It's beasts. It's people.   
---
It's DELICIOUS!
---
It's probably because the intern they hired couldn't distinguish that they are the same armor type.
---
Project definitely need love and since update the formula q side of paradise is impossible and I can't get over a level two creature. Just not enough time.
---
üòî yeah. And in the atom shop if you deselect it doesn't do anything. You have to place the camp again (without the skin). And i only put the skin on because they said that they fixed the bug.... Why did i listened?
---
Just get a magic shotgun and you don‚Äôt even need the shotgunner perks. I‚Äôm a heavy gunner but use a instigating explosive shotgun for running around so I can save ammo for my heavies and I still one shot most normal enemies. Just get all the vats and ap perks and you‚Äôll be good to go
---
As far as I know, no there isn‚Äôt. 
---
I‚Äôve completed wastelanders with both groups and I like to think I‚Äôm fairly thorough. No little side option seems to exist with foundation. 
---
If someone has differing info, I‚Äôd love to hear it n
---
Maybe give us the reward from that event. Too I need the backpack and puncturing bear arm plans.
---
I am assuming they will. Kinda like how on PC, both Steam and Bethesda launcher use the same servers. But that's just my assumption
---
That is amazing!  I was so confused why my alt had all slots available for the base ranks :)
---
Haven't tested it but doesn't tank killer cover pistols now? And forget those guys, they're snuffaluffagus.
---
Lmao. People were complaining so hard last season about all the perk packs
---
Yeeeeeeeeees! I sat it on a dumpster with a campfire to Express my disdain publicly.
---
https://youtu.be/-zPDx6HQ_9w
---
Dang I did it and I‚Äôm replacing my camp now I‚Äôm hope it works
---
I can install on PS4
---
Hopefully they allow all consoles to play together at that point. Ps4 ps5 and Xbox one and series x. That would be nice
---
infinite forest from 2 kinda deal
---
Back in the olden days turning in multiple tech data increased your chances but that doesn't work anymore. Anything beyond the one that triggered the quest should be sold to a vendor. The best advice I can give is do it as often as you can.
---
You made his day! He loves your CAMP
---
He‚Äôs here! I gave him some more plans so he can keep adding cool stuff to his camp :)
---
I currently have 300 radaway on my character.. and 160 diluted .... please no more
---
Have seen exactly zero legendaries at radiation rumble
---
That was killing me in CO OP being a bloodied build and getting killed so much
---
He loved the Nuka cola machine!! THANK YOU!
---
Thank you!! I‚Äôm so glad! I also gave him a few nuclear keycards just in case you both want to launch a nuke together.
---
I don't want to play any other style than what I already di because I love it so much.  No alts for me.
---
You will start dropping 1 stars and heavyweight 2 stars
---
The super mutants at west tec drop a lot of charging laser rifles. Those break down into a lot of plastic with scrapper.
---
Preach on!!!! I think 100% of Us agree!!
---
Hampoodles... coming 2021 to a pet store near you
---
He mentioned that! I‚Äôll have to learn so I can do that. He said he needs me to help launch a nuke! üòÜ
---
No lag here. Though I noticed my loading screens are gone when entering areas at times. I keep thinking rhe game is freezing.
---
I got it with two seconds left to spare. I was definitely sweating.
---
If your under level 50 I think you get different rewards to people over level 50.
---
Bots are hardest enemies 
---
Burrows is longest distance between objectives so hardest there
---
Melee to kill is hardest mutation
---
Otherwise I like volatile because I'm ranged and normally am not affected by the explosions, super mutants are High xp but not all too bad difficulty, and after your learn the layouts, the location doesnt really matter. 
---
Overall I'd say today is a fairly standard difficulty with melle kill only bots as hardest
---
Oh ok thank you. I didn't know if you get a plan or it is like unlocked like an atomic shop item. üëç
---
Bad idea. Too many people put too much into getting max level weapons. So unless they give a one time option to upgrade all level 50 gear to the new max, well, if you think people bitch about the game now....
---
Who is out here downvoting everything?  I did my best to counter by upvoting everything.
---
depends on your play style but most of them will be locked behind a long reputation grind like the armco factory that just makes ammo over time.
---
but that reputation grind is about about 1 and a half months logging in daily at best so don't feel like you need to save for those (that being said the ammo converter's interface leaves a lot to be desired so don't feel like you should prioritize it either)
---
I turned in hundreds of Technical Data prior to getting all the paints over a long time period.  Not worth it in my opinion and T-60 isn‚Äôt that great to begin with.  Turn them in if you find them randomly, don‚Äôt bother farming for it, have someone paint your armor for you that has it unlocked and move on.
---
So why complain then?  They will still outgrow the crafted stuff just as fast as the legendary things. 
---
There are a few exceptions but they will probably ditch it without realizing it's something they should have kept.
---
Did you buy the under armor plan from the gold bullion guy? I believe there was an issue the recent patch fixed that allowed people that bought the camo atom shop skin to make the under armor without knowing the plan
---
Came here to say this.  Great looking camp, but take time for self-care, my dude!
---
I'm sure you're good enough to get some good runs in! They're actually *fun* and the furnishing plans are awesome.
---
Unlike a silo, SBQ and/or Earle doing fast runs these Ops are on par with *Stings &amp; Things* in terms of a cheeky quick daily :)
---
Don't sell yourself short!!
---
Yeah, that's always the question. Honestly I am okay with the mass testing rollout but hopefully adjustments happen quickly and based on all the new data they have access to.
---
I dunno, I already had 3 characters I rotated in and out. My main at lvl. 320, 1 at lvl. 150, the other at 100.
---
I've actually been playing all 3 of them every day because of Daily Ops. I get 3x3 chances at rare rewards every day, so it's been a huge help.
---
Only my main I really care about maxing cards on. Most of the legendary perks are still really great, even at just 1 or 2 ranks.
---
And with extra cards I had laying around, as well as the free 50 coins you get, on my 2 alts I was still able to rank up a couple cards.
---
As for starting a new one now? Meh. There are waaaay too many different grinds in this game to even consider it IMO.
---
What system are you on?
---
Also, melee is your best bet when farming for ammo.
---
I agree some are much harder than others freezing robots by yourself I couldn't get the 8 minutes being a bloodied fixer build level 333
---
Plastic can be farmed at Watoga high school, lead at luck hole mine near the line in the sand event and steel from scrapping weapons with the scrapper perk.
---
Well, you see... West Virginia sits on a very unique point in the time/space continuum.  It's what some physicists call a "Corner in Time".  So what you see is that we keep getting caught in a time loop.
---
Now, I don't want to scare you, but there's a one in a billion chance that we can get caught up in a time loop.  Appalachia sits on what we call a "Corner in Time".
---
And I don't want to scare you, but there's a one in a billion chance that we can get caught up in a time loop.
---
And I don't want to scare you, but A) Appalachia is on a "Corner in Time" and B) Appalachia is on a "Corner in Time".  And B) We could get caught up in a time loop.
---
Physicists call it a "Corner in Time".
---
OldFatGamer.  You and OldFatGamer could be caught in a time corner.  There is a theory that theoretically we could theorize ourselves in a time loop.
---
Oh.  Whew.  It's over.  You can go about your time as usual.  The loop is been broken... I think.  Enjoy your time.  :)
---
Watoga highschool, essentially all the plastic and no enemies in the cafeteria.  Plastic utensils and plates
---
I mean, what's the point if you are only gonna play with one of your friend's balls?
---
Plastic is easy to get if you go to the cat lady house and the Morgantown high school lead is lucky hole mine with excavator,and get the perks super duper and ammo Smith
---
And filler rewards are part of the reason why I rather have a SCORE vendor than a SCOREboard.  Do we really need multiple versions of armor and power armor skins?  If I want the Greenhouse reward first, then I should be able to instead of going through a bunch of rewards that I will never use.
---
Isn‚Äôt that why you play foosball?
---
I know it's been a while, but I have one I can give to you if you like and you're on PC. Hit me up, fancy\_kitten
---
Last game was an overseer‚Äôs desk, but that wouldn‚Äôt make sense since that was for vault 88, so... yeah, a bookshelf and chair would work.
---
I have the opposite. Since the new update Events have been packed on most of servers I've visited. I'm loving it.
---
I deleted the ammo machine from my camp because of its awful UI. Im just going to use Daily OPs to generate ammo now, and fight my OCD from picking up non useful ammo.
---
It used to give you more caps up to 4 documents (I think could have been 3.. Used to always do 2). Check the amount of caps when turning them in, maybe changed. Far as getting the paints, this is what I noticed.
---
When people on the forums were posting and the trade subs had them up for sale. That coincided with the day I had a paint drop. It's probably only certain days they drop to keep it semi rare imo. So do it daily
---
No 6969 then 69420
---
Love sweet water. Plus that Tea he gives you is a nice sub to water for awhile.
---
I am confused, how did the update nerf you?
---
I did it 5 times today and did not have the issues that you pointed out.
---
Wow I'm not even upset, that's impressive
---
At your level you need more types of guns. You probably cant aquire enough ammo to just use one gun yet. And shotguns only have that. Use rifles and pistols as well. Melee on smaller enemies. Consider excavator power armor and run westek for instance. Use it all, from pipeguns to hunting rifles.
---
Not for me, I got a two shot mirv earlier üòÅ
---
Watoga is only useful if they have done Mayor for a Day quest. If not then they are going to have a very bad day
---
Lode bearing auto-completes even if no one starts an auto-miner?
---
I said it nerfed one of my fav things to do. No more low level legendaries to kill, so no more low level legendaries to give away.
---
You're perked into strength already, so I want to suggest the humble but mighty gatling gun. Easily the most ammo efficient gun in the game. 
---
Killing super mutants can almost guarantee you'll never need to make ammo for it, as long as you occasionally come across minigun 5mm mutants to refill your ammo.
---
It‚Äôs super easy once you get the hang of it. I recommend watching some YouTube videos together beforehand to plan out your strategy :) 
---
Please tell your son thank you for the awesome jam session &amp; that his camp is AWESOME! I love the views from the top floor &amp; the balloons!
---
He came up to tell me about all of the purchases. Thanks again! He‚Äôs smiling ear to ear.
---
OK, be proud about not being able to read. That's on you lol at least I can actually say my point with my actual words. You said nothing related to yours. As I said, the only people that are gonna be mad about this are the ones who know the shoe fits and I guess it's your perfect fit. Now bugger off.
---
Because in the past you would run events like Leader of the pack with your high level character and get lvl 5 or lvl 10 legendary drops. You could then improve the items and give them to low level characters. Now, with one wasteland, those wolves are lvl 50 and drop lvl 50 items. So it is hard to collect low level items unless you start a new character.
---
Please don't, just take out the rad kits and nuka shines and just add something else. I don't want perk card packs unless the legendary perk cards get better
---
You can sneak past them.  Once you get into the school you're fine
---
You can if you start to tap fire and slow down on shooting for a sec. Plenty of times where I've used that number remaining in the mag
---
The legendary perks aren't even the best tbh, I want better perk cards before we move away from it
---
I will join feed the people whenever it's up. I used to run by mama dolce's back before it was a server wide event and run the event. It's super simple and I just love doing it.
---
Fair point I guess.
---
That is.. bad. Damn.
---
right now the only thing I uses legendary on alt is the ammo factory so I dont have to waste 1 legendary slot on my main.
---
It's same drop pool as purveyor. Had a ss chest drop too.
---
I know what you mean. When I need to turn in Treasury notes I always choose Foundation because the machine is outside and the one in the Crater is inside
---
We still have no skins for the plasma rifle at all, gat plasma, gat laser. But wait, here's a other handmade skin. üò™
---
oof AND they released repair kits within the same time frame? Yeah, thats some corporate greed right there hah
---
Got vendors with fair prices!
---
Events aren't meant the be solo'd, some can be but most, especially the ones people enjoy, aren't meant to be done alone. I personally still see quite a few people still doing them but starting an event before anyone else can get there is the main reason events ever get failed
---
When you say some, what do you mean? Which events drop fixer / war Glaive?
---
Lol no traps
---
I've found some soldiers camping around the ash heap. They just wandered over after the war.
---
Is it like the sheepsquatch event?  I hated that thing...  no one manned the pylons half the time.
---
Can you solo it?
---
It specifically says that
---
Outside the east end of the tunnel, in the caravan camp, there‚Äôs a guy in a clean dark business suit you talk to. If the event hasn‚Äôt been done recently on that server, conversation with him will have a [start event] option. I could start it that way‚Ä¶ but I end up usually just joining when other people start it.
---
It‚Äôs also glitchy, I tried to use it to buy rail spikes and it sold me flares.
---
Do note that legendary charisma doesn't work how you'd want it to and doesn't increase the number of cards you can share
---
This is exactly what I do. Hell I don‚Äôt even pick 1 stars up anymore.. too much weight not enough reward.. especially when I have weeks of backlog to get through
---
Ah
---
Honestly, I am guessing those paint jobs are coming in season 3. After all, in the seasons they love picking a paint job and spreading that out to many different armors thoughout the score board. Also, season 3 is all BOS themed. So I am guessing that this is what will likely happen.
---
bah thats perfectly fine with me tbh
---
dude yeah go for it. The less people like that in the wasteland the better
---
The Tubman family is moving in whoever the hell they are lol
---
i started selling stimpacks today, TO A TRADER
---
Who the hell uses mininukes by the way?
---
enter build mode if she is out of camp,  remove turrets, remove her console, replace console and talk to her again, make you are in a clear area.
---
It‚Äôs brutal especially when you rely on it.
---
I fully agree that Daily Ops are fun to run.  A short mission with simple objectives makes the time restriction for an optimal run an enjoyable challenge.
---
I believe this timed mechanic was misused originally in the Vault 94 raid as there were separate timed sections with sometimes complicated objectives, easy to fail, and could be very frustrating.
---
Putting pressure or a sense of urgency can ramp up a challenge in some games, but for the longer raid style missions there needs to be a different system.
---
Timed missions have their place and Daily Ops is an appropriate venue.
---
I've experienced essentially no griefing or hacking.
---
Here's one, if someone on your team is claiming an objective stay away from them and let them claim it.
---
 I had a guy yesterday on a team kept getting right in front of me while I already was claiming the uplink, had it halfway claimed, then this guy gets right in front of me, broke the link and had to start it again. Chill the fuck out and let the person claiming the link claim the damn link.
---
You're shooting yourself and your entire team in the foot.
---
I‚Äôve used all five of my slots. 
---
Main is a ‚ÄòTeam Leader‚Äô type that‚Äôs Melee/Heavy Guns/Shotgunner )depending on my mood), with maxed Strength and Charisma 9 so I can share up to a Rank 3 like Inspirational or Fireproof, and also let teammates ‚Äòover-repair‚Äô their gear with Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan.
---
Then I‚Äôve got my Merchant Mule, a Stealth Sniper, a Bloodied Riflewoman and a Junkie Melee Barbarian. 
---
Each one is fun if it‚Äôs own right, and I‚Äôve been running each through Daily Ops chasing the rewards.  Once I‚Äôve got them all, I‚Äôd probably put the alts back in ‚Äòstorage‚Äô. Maybe being them out once a day to quickly sell to a vendor and turn in scrip/notes.
---
FFF
---
I do love good furnishing plans lol
---
Yea i wanna run a bunch
---
lmao the downvotes on this
---
Yep, that's an issue. That's why it takes like an extra 6-10 shots to kill something with shotgun without vats.
---
That would be funny, bunch of luffagus shooting themselves in the feet. Todd logs in and roid rages.
---
Publicenemywon
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind cram, to make cramburgers ‚ù§Ô∏è

If your on xbox I can hook you up on shells. Currently sitting in 500+ I don't use.

Or just give Perk Coins directly.

its honestly ridiculous that they don't have the ability to move accounts like that. Any other mmo and you get to login in another location on another console whatever, and you'll have all the same progress. Bethesda is trying to pioneer mmo gaming when there are many many examples of how these systems should run and have been running for the past several decades in mmo history. Fools imo
---
Dear god no
---
Not really bad at all in adventure mode, I have 500+ hours and you‚Äôll see the odd insta killed SBQ but it‚Äôs happened maybe 3 times in all my time playing
---
NW hacking will be prevalent like 1 in every 25 games (but of course could be one night where a hacker is just running the tables all night) but unless you‚Äôre a regular or actually good it‚Äôs not upsetting 
---
In general my experience hasn‚Äôt been hampered by folks not playing fair; if anything stumbling upon the occasional duper‚Äôs cache is a good experience (one time I happened upon a legacy I was able to flip for some rare items I really needed and otherwise would have taken hundreds of hours to get)
---
While they‚Äôre at it, they should add an option to craft more ammo  based on what‚Äôs in your inventory while at the tinkers bench and chem bench instead of having to spam the craft button repeatedly.
---
I have 207 hours and have yet to experience either.
---
Glad that he got help and all is ok, sounds like this even turned into a nice experience for him in the end!
---
Was he engaged in PvP with the guy destroying his camp? If so, and if he isn't really interested in pvp, he should consider using pacifist mode to stop it from happening again (it's in settings.) But there is also an exploit (Bethesda claims to have fixed it but I don't think it actually is fixed) with a specific type of explosive that can destroy camps... So yeah. If he was in pvp with the guy (it sounds like he was if the turrets were attacking him) it allowed him to destroy the camp. It's a good idea to not engage in PvP near your camp. I made the mistake of engaging w someone at my camp today and got all my crops destroyed (moment of rage fueled stupidity) so it happens.
---
I have max rep with both, but the only thing it shows I can buy from any of the bullion vendors is Lunch boxes. 
---
I'll note that I finished the Season, so I guess since I already have them unlocked I can't buy them?
---
See, comments like this is why Beth wisely doesn‚Äôt try and please people like you. ‚ÄúBethesda changed it to something equally frustrating to use.‚Äù Objectively the improvement is less frustrating because it takes fewer steps to exchange ammo. You‚Äôll never give them credit and never stop complaining.
---
Not as long as you live, RIP Gary.
---
Yeah this is some straight up bullshit when daily ops degrade weapons and armor much faster.  
---
A massive problem when you don't sell 'just cosmetics'.  You end up disrupting enjoyment for profit.  I know many would disagree but I'd prefer a free and paid track battle pass than atom shop kits and paid QoL camp items.
---
It varies. It‚Äôs easier for cheats or hacks to happen on PC, and NW is a dice roll. But it‚Äôs manageable.  But you also get to play on the PTS.
---
Overall, I‚Äôd say that while it can happen, it doesn‚Äôt really happen too often in the grand scheme of things. Just something to keep an eye out for.
---
Right now there are new griefing methods even on console, so no platform is ever 100% ‚Äòclean‚Äô.
---
I know they weren‚Äôt taken away from people but I was wondering if they can still drop
---
Then I missed the timer. At least I know for the next time.
---
That‚Äôs very interesting.
---
which is why i only do the ones i can solo
---
Don't we all!!!!!! :D
---
If you're PS4 and wanna get in on the action let us know. If you're not, I'm *sure* peeps will take you and the pistolier on a run.
---
There‚Äôs 100% one at the bottom by the shaft.
---
Well then I just didn‚Äôt get shit.
---
Its doable solo, won't get the best rank tho.
---
You‚Äôre good mate, Have a good day
---
haha same here. I only get them all for the atoms with no need to use them otherwise.
---
Not for me. Idk
---
I love this
---
They aren't supposed to be easy to obtain lol
---
Yeah he was moving about, first thing I checked like I expect most people would.
---
They're going to be much closed to the ones from 4 than anything else. Remember, the brotherhood aren't the good guys.
---
As far as we know the retro compatibility doesn't imply augmented performance(maybe load times),so the two would just be the same game on the same server.
---
Bethesda should just find a way to get rid of duped items and give shorter suspensions
---
-Super useful Perks: Fireproof, Team Medic, Friendly Fire if you have a decent Flamer
---
-Haven't tested this yet but Ops are so good for ammo drops I'm considering doing them alone just for ammo grinding (and since time doesn't matter after you get Elder rank). It's so good I just got my Gauss Shotgun and modded it to be Prime, started with 100~ Ultracite 2mm and am now over 1200 from just Ops drops.
---
-Learn each dungeon. The objectives have been in the same place every time so far.
---
-Keep an eye on the objective to see if you're going out of range. If you see the number of people on point dropping then get back in. You don't need to melee every enemy as soon as it spawns. 
---
-Loot AFTER the Ops is done. Bodies don't despawn and you have 4 or 5 minutes after the boss is downed before you're kicked. More than enough time to pick up more than you spent on ammo and stims.
---
I have an extra if you‚Äôre on PS4.
---
The issue is many people don't have a daily routine and real life means we have to play when we can.
---
Same, I always upvote all to counter the salty users
---
Radiation Rumble is actually seeing new life.  With the XP boost due to higher level enemies, the ghouls are being mostly farmed by people showing up for good XP.  Not many are bothering with ore collection, though, so I usually gather enough to at least get rank 2 rewards.
---
2500+ hours in since launch of the game and i have not experienced either of those. There are people who say NW has cheaters/"hackers" but i can't deny or confirm that since i don't play that gamemode.
---
True goal
---
Yeah, my buddy was pretty happy that Pistols are a bit more viable
---
yeah i think you have like 5min to loot. I'm not sure but i think you get the rewards as soon as you finish, i noticed i immediately got more ammo when i finished the op, sometimes you don't get the rare rewards, there's a 5%, 10% and 80% chance of getting a rare reward, once i got none and once i got 2, so that might be it man. better luck next time
---
I have a i33 I still carry on my main. Also a tse handmade for cripples.
---
Adventure: 0 greifing for me, as for hacks, you'll occasionally see players using hacked weapons on endgame bosses, just get your damage in fast and you'll be fine.
---
NW: lol, rip.
---
Very helpful! Thank you.
---
Everything in the game will drop max level for you now.
---
Public teams are great for this. If you find a public daily ops team that isn't doing daily ops you should just create one. People who actually want to do daily ops usually join pretty quickly. I also make sure to switch the goal to casual once I'm done doing the daily op of the day.
---
Strange. No idea how one of my toons ended up with an extra, then. I ate one early and then found another.
---
Sorry I couldn‚Äôt help, then.
---
Same for me but with grenades. I bust em all out for ACP and mobs. But damn game lags when tryna grab em, and I need to jump in asap. Mine Stash would be perfect.
---
:D
---
I did it the other night and it didn't drop either.  Maria's body wasn't even there.
---
I hear you. I physically have to write down what ammo I have plus the amount before I go in the system.
---
I can understand the exchange rates but for fucks sakes display what I have available.
---
There's actually a decent chunk of people playing the PTS to bug test.
---
Most people wont. It is a terrible game mode and you can easily complete the pass without doing one.
---
I can grind out 300 score through experience faster then the nw challenges , unless it‚Äôs place a camp .
---
Oh, ok.  
---
I‚Äôve always stood on the island, killed the suitors, then killed the queen when she surfaced.  Always got the ‚Äúevent complete/success‚Äù notice, got other rewards, but no T-notes. 
---
 Also thought since it was a public event with the ! annotation, as long as it completed successfully, T-notes should have been awarded.
---
Daily Raids and Daily Scavenge Runs
---
Was not in my experience
---
Thank you!!
---
Oh that's what it is? I've definitely had it happen occasionally for months.
---
"It costs 400,000 dollars to fire this weapon, for twelve seconds"
---
I love both... the only air time issues I find annoying is, say, you're running to a rail station to sell... you jump up to land on the platform, except you jump super high, higher than the roof line, so you have to wait to more slowly float back down to land so you can run under the roof and sell.
---
That and other examples of the same type of thing are about the only "problem" I have... it takes getting used to, but I woudn't play without it. You can reach so many more places, or hop across roofs, rocks/gaps, etc with ease.
---
The balloons were specifically for the new friends after the post. He said he specifically was looking for a cliff. He is grinning ear to ear! Thank you so much!
---
I'm on xbox. I have a group of friends I can play with in game.This was all just about the people who would seek me out when I would accept playing with randos. I get a lot of messages and invites to join teams because I have an obvious female gamertag.
---
I like the nukashine
---
LOL I do that all the time with VATS..
---
Also, I jump straight up and look straight down after large battles in tall grass to find all the dead bodies.
---
I nuked a camp recently (the guy was saying horrible things in area chat after ruining every event with some hacked weapon... Maybe legacy but it seemed OP even for that.) Anyway half the server turned up to see the ruins and after calling me some rude names, the nuked camp guy left the server. Everyone celebrated. It was beautiful.
---
Aiming down the sights
---
I mean, it's true.  One of them is useful, one of them... well...
---
It's a hot mess.  I can see what they're trying to do by keeping it in the clunky style of the game terminals, but we just want it to look like a normal trade window.
---
If we're bringing real life into this Bows should benefit from high STR considering I hear those fuckers need some serious muscle to use
---
Be/tse gat plasma
---
U cheated and got banned in a game that says cheat and u get banned ::0 
---
U can buy another copy if you‚Äôre still trynna play but redditor‚Äôs opinions won‚Äôt change Bethesda‚Äôs mind on the verdict
---
Were you ever given any warnings or anything in the past?
---
Also, it does kind of matter what you did. For example, if you hacked other people's accounts - that should result in a perma ban (in my opinion). If you dupped, it does seem like a little bit of an overkill since many of the duppers who were caught in the ban wave a couple of months ago were ultimately given back their accounts.
---
What exactly did you do?
---
You‚Äôre right.  I tend to do that, so I always use the diluted variants of both :)
---
A gauss shotgun with anti-armor/50% limb damage/15%reload speed does the job for me. Always 1-3 shotting people. (The stagger is really nice too due to the million explosions it creates)
---
Well, longbows do.  And honestly, why not?  I agree.
---
You melee peeps are sorely needed when it comes to resilient being in the mix, as a heavy I'm reliant on others running in for the killing blow.
---
What platform are you playing?
---
I still need someone to tell me if the unique skin is unlocked for other if the same weapon or not
---
... Actually, that skin may be why you can't sell it. Try removing it if possible?
---
You can absolutely solo it, but you need to have a good build to do well in it. I have a pretty tanky bloodied heavy gunner/PA build, and I've come very very close to getting the highest rank solo. Part of the problem of doing it solo is you don't progress as quickly through the timed parts because it's a function of how many players are in the area.
---
BE15 is best, imo.
---
Fuck no
---
How do be at 20% health and tse at full health compare?
---
The issue with make rolling pin or cue viable is why move up the weapon teirs? If this were a SP game obviosuly who cares. But being a mmo u need stuff for people to chase or else people's have no goal and lose interest in the game.
---
If I can pick up a random rolling pin or even a decent rolled legendary and bonk every enemy why, grind for a god roll war glaive? (One of the best melee weapon atm).
---
And imo if you are heavy gunner and arnt using PA you missing out on alot of dmg due to stabilized. But its isnt absolute nessecary.
---
For me nothing is more badass being clad in t65 holding a single side of rad rumble with ease with my gauss minigun. Makes you feel like a badass. While people running there nerfed bloodied builds get 1 shot all the time now while I legit never die due to absorption.
---
Marvelous job!
---
Watogo high school is the best spot
---
Remove the stone of shame,  attach the stone of success!
---
He is just trying to give her a hug....
---
Thank you! üëç
---
I've managed to complete every daily op solo with elder so far, basically entirely on my first shot.
---
They're easy as.
---
Most regular players have more treasury notes than they know what to do with so they don‚Äôt care about events other than SBQ, Ecryptid and ACP. Other events don‚Äôt have good rewards and aren‚Äôt a very good source of xp, which is what the focus is during seasons.
---
I pick up and drop all legendary items that don‚Äôt suit my build .90rw is the only thing worth keeping for script lol
---
It has nothing to do with legendary perks honestly. I have 4 endgame characters and right now it allows me to farm the rare stuff in Daily Ops. 
---
My main character has near everything now. With Fallout1st i go in a private world drop my plans in a world container, quickly change character and comeback in that private world container to get the plans.
---
And if you like building or testing some building tricks or camp locations without messing with your main character's camp everytime, it's pretty useful having multiple characters. 
---
I wish you could see my raider character's camp man. I went crazy with that one, i used steel posts to create multiple cabins in deferent hight here and there and built some sort of lil bridges to connect them together. It's cool ! 
---
I didn't know i could do that and i'm really happy to have created this alt character !
---
[Edit:] And on top of that you are having diferent gameplay experiences. Sometime i just wanna vats everything in my view and sometime i just wanna tank everything destroy everything with my heavy gun or i just wanna oneshot everything with my shotgun build. It all depends on how you like experiencing the game.
---
I think some people want to play solo.
---
Please nuke wherever you want! It gets so boring on the same two sites, last night someone nuked whitesprings and it was such a lovely surprise.
---
Looks like something out of Warhammer
---
I think it's a problem of the visual effect not being tested in all lighting conditions. Also it doesn't work on robots. Not sure if ghouls count as living.
---
Ive gotten 3 new pets this patch (the most resilient has been a mole rat) and this all checks out, cheers &lt;3
---
Might be worth mentioning u can have the Brahmin fertilizer resource and a pet at the same time for maximum creature comforts
---
Oh also in my experience having almost exclusively cliff-side CAMPS, sometimes your pets don‚Äôt like the spawns in your CAMP and will spawn by themselves wandering nearby. You‚Äôll think they‚Äôre dead but they‚Äôre actually just arbitrarily loitering 30 feet away from your camp bounds or on (or in) a cliff face. The pet‚Äôs spawn and behavior is semi-attached to the CAMP module itself so if you‚Äôre having trouble getting your critter to spawn where you want it to keep trying to move your camp module and relog the server. It may be that it‚Äôs impossible for a pet to be at ur place tho. This also varies by pet type I‚Äôve had camps which host mirelurk kings and sloths fine but a death claw will spawn far away for some reason.
---
Basically like all mechanics in Bethesda games it‚Äôs finicky and idiosyncratic just fidget till you break it in a way you like
---
Edit: we need more community mythbusters on obscure mechanics
---
Forsure. Ill join u in a bit. Finishing off a trade. My gamertag is FoggyJavier19
---
it just works!
---
Not the gat plasma but I have a tse and be 10mm machine guns and the tse does more damage when both have the extra dmg from adrelinal reaction and nerd rage, I don‚Äôt know how it is with gay plasma tho
---
I can make them, hop on my server and i'll drop you some.
---
IGN: Sayres_Law
---
‚ÄúIn my experience, there is no such thing as luck‚Äù
---
Also, this was months ago. Like almost a year ago. Don't judge me. I mean, you can if you want lol I have a 2 shot combat sniper rifle that I've used since
---
legacies are expensive.  Takes a rare item or real money. but bloodied, anti armor, junkies or currently teo shot explosive.  2nd star either fast fire or explosive.  last usally 90 percent reduced weight is most desirable
---
Radscorpions.... why did it have to be radscorpions.
---
Perk coins maybe?
---
The funny thing is, the Season Rewards were one thing PTS players weren't allowed to touch.
---
The problems with the Weight Bench and this would have been discovered almost immediately, I could guarantee it.
---
Thank-you very much for this updated information! I saw your comment on another thread earlier and was hoping you'd perhaps make a separate post. Excellent work.
---
I think that the bow and the crossbow are a joke from Bethesda
---
Full send it, you don't lose anything if you  die in this game other than junk which you can retrieve
---
I agree.
---
I think there are some rough edges in terms of how the actual matchmaking works, and the difficulty can fluctuate quite a lot based on the mutation, but overall, it's exactly what the game needed.

Finished ours at 7:58 today.  It would've been faster, but I didn't expect to do it.  I tried using my teammate to fast travel since he was closer to my destination and wound up in the Daily Ops.  After debating with myself to stay or not, I decided to stay and run it.  But since I wasn't prepared, I had to get into my PA, change some perks around to get me un-encumbered, then finally run to the first spot.
---
I guess I can't trust using teammates as fast travel right now.  It didn't even show him in a daily op.  He was at another player's camp, so I assumed he was shopping.  But I'm glad we made time.
---
Thank you and the Brahmin's a wonderful idea!
---
How does death work with pets?
---
Can anyone just run up and murder my hypothetical pet mole rat? 
---
What about other mobs?
---
Good suggestions for perks, however, White Knight is not available until level 39 and Sun Kissed until level 45. Ammosmith, which you didn't mention, is not available until level 34 and Super Duper until level 50. There's a big gap between OP's level 15 and the point when the really useful cards are available. They said they were going to adjust the scale for lower levels so hopefully it is soon.
---
Yep.  Decided to stay in the mine one day when the tunnel was blocked just past the entrance, a bug that doesn't happen often.  Went afk for a bit and came back with enough time to take a step backwards, leave the mine, and get rewarded
---
I think of these the same way as I think of getting that present you totally don‚Äôt need from a semi-well-intentioned but clueless relative. It‚Äôs a gift card, with a fucked up shape.
---
Save them. One day when you‚Äôre limited on your play time and maybe won‚Äôt hit the cap limit, claim and sell. They are just caps, with a different title.
---
They were reward from the special scorched that spawned during the Christmas season, I just know that they give plans, caps, ammo and maybe junk
---
I‚Äôve got IE 15 and it‚Äôs a monster
---
LOL Get outta my head! I figured this would be way easier for everyone involved :D
---
Wait, so an aae mini gun is legacy?
---
Gay plasma
---
I played the entire game start to finish, to lvl150ish without a build for the first year...
---
I wasn't until after I came back from a break when Wastelanders came out that I learned about these "builds".  I went bloodied sneak and wondered why I didn't do this sooner. I struggled so much. It was a huge challenge most of the time. I never understood how everyone could so easily 1-shot everything in the game. I had good weapons too, but it wasn't until I properly setup the perks and stats that I realized what I was missing out on all this time.
---
I'm glad I got to play the entire game without a build. Now I'm glad I have it though so I can blaze through all the dailies, ops and other stuff going on for daily maintenance.
---
Appalachia needs people like you, seventh-six üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
---
Ha! Yes, I forgot that and will add it. If you have pacifist OFF yes, other nefarious players can kill them. Mobs CAN if there are enough and they are high level enough. I tend to go for tankier pets because of this.
---
no  legacies are energy weapons with a secondary explosive effect.  Bethesda stopped dropping them
---
I love my 2* TS limb damage minigun more than ANY other weapon I own. If only it had that reduxed weight (and magic damage never gets fixed) I'd throw all other guns into the scripper.
---
Just do the story lines. They will naturally flow to where you're able to play at your level, as well as level you up, give you stuff and more.
---
I never went out of my way to do anything extra except the story line when I first started playing and did just fine.
---
but that is a good gun now with demo expert.  just be prepared to repair more often.
---
All of them are except the War Glaive plan.
---
The auto correct, lol
---
Why run Medic Pump and not Emergency Protocols?
---
Legendary perks allow me to equip more perks. I like that a lot. Ammo one is also great.
---
Use emergency protocols
---
I honestly thought there would be perk coin spaces, was surprised there were none.
---
Yeah, although rainbow colored plasma balls would be cool.
---
You should consider changing medic pump into emergency protocols, which is considered to be a must have for bloodied PA.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Emergency\_protocols](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Emergency_protocols)
---
Griefing is almost nonexistant.
---
Hacking, it depends. Fairly often in Nuclear Winter. 
---
Adventure mode, the only thing you'll really see are hacked weapons/armor. Armor you'd probably never know, weapons... are far more common than I'd like, but that's still like once a server.
---
Once i was in a vender after a event to sell all my crap, well, one lvl 30 dude was unpacient af (me a lvl 75) , so he start to shot me, i was enable to pvp and kill him, i sell all my crap, he wait me in the exit and kill me. F
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a bug that was ported over from Fallout 4. Character just has some difficulty running on the terrain from time to time
---
My dumb ass has always thought I needed Wasteland Whisperer equipped, too. üòÇ I really appreciate you going out of your way to help people get the pet they're after, though. I just wish Bethesda cared as much about our pets as we do!
---
Polite queueing? Where was this taken, wimbledon? ü§î
---
I don't get how people are enjoying this. It's another daily mission I log onto, do once for the day, and that's it. Another mindless grind.
---
Yeah, I agree.  Fallout 76 is my first foray into the genre at my sons suggestion.  We got in on the early Beta and played together through it's full release.  My son however got seriously annoyed and grew impatient with all the bugs and stability issues.  Mind you he was a fairly loyal franchise follower.  I have stuck with it as I like the style of game play, generally speaking.  That being said, I probably have been too tolerant and forgiving.  They seem to be adding content, and that is great, it helps keep a game alive, but it still suffers routinely from glitches and stability issues, especially when they do updates.  It seems like they fix something, but also break something else, sometimes it is something they seemingly fixed previously.
---
So, it begs the question, why is there still such a big hole in their ability to deal with cheating.  If they were on top of it they should be able to respond quickly giving a warning and consequence if necessary.  But there should also be a graduated approach (other than for egregious acts, like stalking/harrasing a player online or things of that nature).  But given a sizeable portion of the playerbase are "kids", they need to expect that they make mistakes.  I mean for real, everyone makes mistakes as they grow up.  It doesn't feel appropriate to boot someone for life if it is in fact their fist mistake, other than those egregious ones.
---
Yeap you can solo it, as a heavy myself, I just run from objective to objective, only shoot when I need to, until the final boss moment when you need to kill everything to get the boss out..  
---
My build isn't optimised, but with a Vampire Weapon I don't need stimpaks or healing, and i've managed to solo at Eldar rank each one so far at around the 7:28-7:42 time frame, have to say it is sooooo much easier in a team for me though.
---
Beth has a lot of decent ideas, they're just never executed well. DOS2 is awesome though, but very different game. I *want* to like Kenshi, I just can't get into it.
---
Same here but we may just be lucky lol
---
Imo junkies beats out bloodied in heavy department, you get very similar dmg to bloodied. Honestly bloodied kinda meh in comparison to junkies after patch.
---
"But bloodied is the I win build!" To a certain degree. Imo if your rocking heavy guns your really screwing yourself over if you dont use PA. Bloodied imo shines more with normal armor due to unyeilding. But you cant use unyeilding in PA.   You can use emergency protocols which is great if u want to.
---
But imo why? I still delete everything with my junkies gauss minigun, and legit never die. Since the new patch I havnt went down once in my PA. This is due to not being constantly at low health and electric absorption is god teir. Sure your sacrificing little dmg for god levels survivability.
---
If you dont want bloodied or junkies, I'd say two shot explosive. Or anti armor.
---
When you have junk in your inventory with the scrap you need:
---
Go to Inventory &gt; Junk in your Pip-Boy
---
Look at the bottom of the screen for "Components" to view your junk in it's equivalent scrap
---
Select the scrap you want to be marked
---
This will place a magnifying glass next to any thing you look at with any of the scrap types you're looking for. It helps you know what to pick up and what not to while you're traveling so you don't pick up shit you don't need.
---
Good scrap to select for early game:
---
Acid
---
Adhesive
---
Aluminum 
---
Lead
---
Nuclear Material
---
Screws
---
(Could be missing some, but these are a good start)
---
As you figure out more about what you need or don't need you can adjust your marked scrap components as needed.
---
More nuclear keycards!
---
I think you really like writing essays
---
Yeah, I don't want people wasting any more perks now that they are REALLY valuable AND we can all use a buddy in the Wasteland!
---
Cool, thank you! Been playing since a few months after launch, and there‚Äôs always been a lot of conflicting information. This helps a ton.
---
Perk Card packs are cool and all but, as someone who isn't buying atoms, I want more Atom rewards
---
I just sell all rad-x I get. I get enough rad away and diluted rad away from just playing the game that I don't need any extra either. Same with the healing kits. I suppose they could be really good for players that are earlier in the game or full health builds. I'm happy with a lot of the changes to the second season tho.
---
Huh? I‚Äôve had like 2 lag spurts and one DC over the course of hundreds of NW games
---
I‚Äôm almost certain that ATHENA killed my pet when my turret went agro on her (or her it).  Something to keep in mind if you progress through the ally side quest and actually keep her (spoiler).  Since she is invincible, it‚Äôs impossible to stop her attacks.
---
me who is a level 69 and has had this game since release day :0
---
My pleasure! Now go get that chic- uh I mean Deathclaw!
---
Yesterday was the first Tea Time I've seen failed.  Almost instantly, with 4 people, we lost the main one.   By the end we were all huddled behind the RR, as that was the last one standing at half health.
---
Campfire Tales is probably my favorite event (so friggin... horrifying) and now I'm not sure I even want to risk it.
---
Let me show you its features.
---
Shotgun is super viable, though very close range.
---
Enforcer and Skeet Shooter help them become limb breakers, which can totally shut down spawns in ACP by making them immobile, or making assaultrons ezpz after disabling their lasers with a head shot. Even Sentry Bots go down really fast since they're such a big target and there's so many parts to break they'll end up giving up and self destructing when they've run out of attack options.
---
The Double Barrel has the fastest fire rate of the shotties, and if you can get a Quad ammo capacity roll you now have amazing DPS, though should also have Speed Demon since you *will* be reloading all the time.
---
If not a DB, the Gauss is really good, but needs Fireproof and Demolition Expert to outpace the QDB in my experience. 
---
Both +Blocking armor and +33 VATS accuracy weapons are still magic effects for shotguns. When using magic shotties I recommend Grim Reaper's Sprint since it's VATS where magic shotties shine and while shotties aren't super VATS efficient I can get kills in 2 or 3 VATS hits depending on the distance and the 35% chance of refil on kill is super helpful
---
For ammo, Earle and Daily Ops are both super good for grinding. Ops are even massively efficient for Ultracite 2mm. It's great.
---
TL;DR: Boomstick good stick
---
Personally I like hunger and thirst since it adds an element of realism to the game. I just wish they‚Äôd slow it down more.
---
Level 37 here, about a month into game and I'd say it's about 50/50, sorry. Have had my fair share of encounters with DB's who want to stealth kill you and/or engage in combat constantly knowing they're way higher lvl than you (mostly below lvl 50-100's doing this). Not to mention over-powered lvl 200+'s coming in all stealth and gauss rifling you to death at your workshops ALL the DAMN TIME. Community is meh. Lack of text-chat makes it pretty quiet.
---
I do appreciate those who have donated but most of the time later I realize it's just their junk from CAMP attack drops, etc. Not that they have to take the time to donate/could be grateful for that but.. I find it almost easier to solo. Friends is also broken for me. I add people all the time. Xbox shows me they're online but they don't show up in the FO76 friends list AT ALL for some reason?? I don't get that/if someone could explain how friending works in Xbox in a simple way that'd be great, thanks. Otherwise , Lone Wanderer for me!
---
I hope the turret attack problem is fixed. I tend not to use them but I have seen pets fight with them.
---
Melee is honestly the way to go at the start imo. I was a full melee build all the way to like 2 months before wastelanders and I switched to heavy gunner.
---
Strength is the best special stat in the game imo. Has the most build variety, 1 handed melee,two handed,unarmed,heavy gun,shotguns.
---
So if you ever get bored its super easy to switch builds I do it all the time and never have to move my special around not once.  Were if you go for commando or rifle build your basically stuck using only those two.
---
I never understood why they do it as a personal timer. Just have it reset on the servers at 1 specific time each day regardless of who did what. That‚Äôs my thought anyway...like it was back in the good ole days of W.O.W.
---
Not so much, but given it was extremely glitchy yesterday and I had to quit and restart, it might have been weighing on my mind a little more.  I mean seriously, it is coming up on being two years old, stability should have been established long ago.
---
Hadn't thought of that. Someone else spend 100 scrip to find out. There was no atomic shop icon next to the item in my list.
---
That had some much potential all it ended up being was rushing through randomly generating platforms to get to the actual content lol
---
Yep, 90RW is amazing for scrip, that‚Äôs why I enjoy ACP, but I hate that there‚Äôs no rep kits and it doesn‚Äôt give more flux.
---
Bows are great with the instigating effect and sneak.
---
Cool dont make thwm easy but make more of them so i can grind multiple at once
---
Great walkthru, thanks for demystifying.
---
Not sure if magic items come into play or not, but having a high ROF minigun plus a limb damage modifier (AA helps too) is an efficient heavy killing machine.  
---
Something I found out recently is +50% limb damage only affects the crippling speed of limbs. It does no additional limb damage.  Always thought it would help on heavies as you‚Äôre not accurately aiming.  Live n learn.
---
The nerf allows me to equip for perks, since most damage boosts don't affect damage that much like it use to. The max perk cards only increase damage by 40 ish, which is about a bullet or 2 depending on the Weapon I'm question. Sneak is broken right now so the sneak legendary perk for damage, doesn't really work. The ammo one is nice, and the posion resist and exploding creatures is nice. But the ammo one, even the regular perk card, you only put it on when you need it. They could have added in more cards worth while. A bunch of melee resist, and PA perks but nothing for shotguns, range, heavys, etc really. More damage cards would be nice with the nerds
---
It‚Äôs going to stay in the game and you can keep filling it, just that apparently their gonna remove the negative side of not doing it or something like that. It‚Äôs gonna be completely optional If I remember correctly.
---
Do we get treasury notes for each spec ops even if we have done the 3 tiers?
---
You're welcome!
---
I've heard one way this can happen is when someone joins mid-ops.
---
Sucks but you're only option is give up and try again.
---
He's such a cool guy
---
You get the following chances of plans if you get elder 1st try
---
No plan 17.1%
---
One plan 71.2%
---
Two plans 11.2%
---
Three plans 0.5%
---
No both versions are equally shit! The only improvement was allowing more rounds to be exchanged but it no longer tracks what you have, where before it would hide options you didn't have enough for.
---
We've already told them how to make it work correctly and be way for players to use!
---
I'm referring to the item and not the plans, to clarify.
---
I still see plenty of people. I saw heart of the swamp come up last night while doing some crafting and it was done before I could finish repairing my gear
---
It‚Äôs less of a hassle to raid the Lucky Hole Mine, kill all the cultists, mine all the lead, sell the excess loot at Grafton station, head back to camp, and make ammo at my workbench, then to use the Ammo Converter. That‚Äôs how bad the UI is Bethesda.
---
Well if your going off real life it still wouldn't matter if Arnold himself was using the bow a 50 cal shot is still gonna be better then a bow lol
---
They are fun and I've been playing them a lot. I have some critiques that may be unpopular:
---
1. The reward drops are crazy, tons of stimpacks, tons of rad-aways. Took me a while to realize why my character could practically not move at first.
---
2. There might need to be a restriction on how many times you can play it per day or per hour or something. I was in a group that spammed it about ten times in a row and I'm swimming in grenades and resources and legendaries. That's fine, sure, but I wonder if this is taking away from other events. I've noticed fewer nukes, etc.
---
3. The enemies and mutations may need to be expanded. They could get old pretty soon.
---
Wasn't the case here. We all joined right away. Perhaps there is something else that triggered it. We stuck around for about 8 min and gave up after that.
---
Biggest issue's for me is either getting lost in the tunnels and running the clock out trying to find my way back, or the damn freezing attack that's slows me down (seems to glitch out and stop my Gauss Gatlin from spinning up).
---
Creatures only seem to spawn in an area while your in it, so I just run straight past them, shoot the ones that spawn around the objective while it completes, then run past the rest to the next objective, looting bodies can be done after the event completes, so don't waste time.
---
Bethesda realizing this is why we aren't getting more
---
That'd be awesome.
---
Yeah I have 4 characters and only one is 2 handed melee. I hate how they handled the war glaive. It‚Äôs one of my top 3 items I‚Äôm looking for this season and I just know I‚Äôm gonna have some nightmare scenario where it drops on every character but my 2 hander.
---
Haven‚Äôt had an issue with turrets in weeks (months?).  But everyone in my base including Daquerre attacks ATHENA when this happens.  So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm 99% sure it was her.  Had a Mirelurk Hunter since early August with no issues till she showed up.  
---
Tempted to just disband her but I don‚Äôt want to lose my lovers embrace perk
---
+ I‚Äôm in an area in the Toxic Valley that gets frequent attacks.  Partially my fault but my fence kept everything out.  An assaultron laser beam destroys things though that normally would hold up
---
I think it's a good addition.  Regular armor can already have poison resistance, pa can't.
---
They use to be a loot drop from a past event. Now they're mostly a means of dupers to gets a ton of caps for nothing.
---
That doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with what I‚Äôm asking for.
---
Server hop between PA spawn location. Penitentiary ; BOS firebase;
---
Boo to Daily Ops. Biased because I'm lvl 37 and its recommended I don't play it until 50.  
---
That and they've made it a Daily Score thing constantly. Thanks Bethesda.. I can understand you have a lot of angry ppl above 50, but for newbs that don't constantly play, this doesn't help.
---
I swapped out to Gramps for less noise and, well, less homicidal robots generally. And he grants the Kindred Spirit buff which is the same but less awkward!
---
They seem to like making random shit untradeable.
---
Still pissed my alt got 2x Father Winter PA Helmets while my main got fuck all.
---
Not good enough? Okay you win, mini nukes.
---
Agreed, I only have 1 character I could really use this on as well. If we could at least roll them more reliably I'd be happier but in the meantime its not even worth grinding for.
---
Someone bought my BoS outerwear item that dropped the other day for 12000 caps. I'm still picking up plans from vendors, so for me it was worth it. The texture is pretty low quality (especially if you compare the BoS logo to the logo on the beret), and I don't think I'm going to take off that tattered dress until something else comes along with any sort of bonus.
---
Because dupers.
---
I just recently got a mutants 50 limb 15 faster reload, it‚Äôs that good?
---
The low level events are rough. Used to be fun pigeon shoots, now they're dull with rad toads and botflies like tanks. Not worth it.
---
Yeah, he just said exploit but there are little small ones that are whatever and some that are just not great. But they probably wouldn't ban someone permanently for any of that so it would have to be pretty bad. So since they didn't explain what they did I'm gonna assume it was bad enough that people would not be on there side if they did say what it was. Maybe I'm wrong though so I would also like to know.
---
Regular armor can have poison resistance so theoretically you don't need it as much as a pa user would.
---
Nukashine is a fun filler reward if just to stick into punch bowls and see who will sip
---
I totally Flux and repair kits would have been a more appreciative reward . See what happens on season three .
---
I too got 2x father winter helmets instead of the 1 mask I was grinding my life away for
---
I am more than happy to fill that role, assuming you dont mind me lobbing grenades every which way as well.
---
Unfortunately this is the answer
---
Radaway herrraaah. Gethcha Radaway heeeeeeere. Five caps, only five caps, 5 caps heeeeere get your radawaaaaaay heeeeeere
---
Ten pack of floater grenades incoming
---
90 percent weight reduction
---
I'm definitely catching up to ur level!
---
Oh, it's great.
---
Until you turn 30 and realize you completely wasted your critical forming years.
---
....not that I did that or anything.
---
I would not mind having presets available for settings up perk card. Like for me, I run a 'glass canon' build. But, I'd like a preset for when I'm crafting items at base. 3 presets should suffice for most people, but I don't know.
---
You put the Ammosmith perk with the Legendary Ammo card &amp; SuperDuper, you're literally an ammo God. I had 6 plasma cores today, turned them into Ultracite Plasma Cores &amp; now I have 42 of them. I am very happy with the ammo perk since I've had to completely change my build. (Was bloodied unarmed)
---
Yup.  "I only duped a hundred legacies, but it was the first time!  What do you guys think?"
---
By the gods yes
---
Bethesda listen to this man!
---
Nice guide btw.  There was a post about taming recently and @MojaveBreeze indicated Snallygasters can be tamed without Whisperer.  That was the biggest misconception on my part (needing it)
---
Fill your boots matie! doesn't everyone love fire works :)
---
Or just straight up Perk Coins would be nice.
---
Get them to try again but this time solo. I did it solo yesterday with a character that already got the backpack a long time ago and the stash still had a backpack plan, even indicating that I'd already learned it.
---
If it's still a problem, just report it to support. Not much else you can do.
---
Not really. Smooth as butter for me.
---
Yeah and you can use fireproof too so why would anyone use sizzling style? Because it‚Äôs better.
---
They could've just copied New Vegas's ammo system. They could've made a system like the in-game shops have. Just assign each ammo type its own value, and make it so you could exchange it exactly how the vendors work now. Preferably without the BS time-gates they love so much. 
---
Instead they got really lazy with it and arbitrarily recycled the terminal for the dailies. I honestly can't think of a way Bethesda could've made the UI more obnoxious, without making a deliberate effort.
---
Even if we give them credit which yes they deserve for trying. Its still a kinda useless and tedious as hell to use. 
---
Sure, they listened. But they only listened to a tiny piece and made it slightly less tedious. It is still for the most part clunky for no reason.  Tedious. Also somehow doesn't work for somethings so it obviously wasn't tested. Even after they "fixed" it. 
---
I think you cant please everyone but like this hardly pleased anyone.
---
God even getting out of the ui is fucking shitty I have to spend liek 8 minutes just trying to get out of the damn thing
---
I feel you 100% my dude.
---
I sure as hell couldn't grind through from scratch again. I mean I have always enjoyed the game despite everything I pushed through solo. Haven't had a group for hardly any of it because most of the friends I made stopped playing or just were never on when I was. Dealt with tons of griefing and other bs along the way. Solo and low level seems an easier target I guess.
---
I even had the first perfect roll weapon I've ever received  stolen which was a b ffr fr combat rifle which I received shortly after meat week this year and I have been playing since the beta test.
---
It's not a bad game despite it's problems but without a mic, text chat, or guilds/clans/factions whatever you want to call it friends are not easy to make at all. 
---
I'd just rather not push through all that again.
---
The ammo converter I feel is probably an effect of trying to make an MMO out of an older single player rpg engine
---
It just screams "we tried to shoehorn this mechanic in but the engine wasn't having it"
---
I experienced a couple of griefers and I‚Äôve played since release on and off.
---
Oh you can do that without being a stoner!
---
YES, and thanks! Since I saw that I was toying with the idea of making this post and then things just blew up and here we are lol!
---
Supposedly (based on Angry Turtle), this effect comes into play when the ROF exceeds 200 and has this effect.   It‚Äôs hard to test on my end, but it melts Earle compared to my Final Word or AA Laser Gat
---
And yeah, that‚Äôs good if you have a mutation.  Try it out and see
---
4 is the only Fallout title I haven't finished (including BoS). It disappointed me more than 3. I liked New Vegas quite a bit though. '76 is just OK.
---
I have a question I just got to level 46 and class freak is not showing up as a perk card I can pick you get when I level up but I got one out of a perk pack does it only come out of those?
---
And unfortunately there'll inevitably be a glitch (or maybe the last one still hasn't been patched) that'll let them trade "untradeable" stuff anyway.
---
So just like DRM, in the end it screws the legit players more.
---
Don‚Äôt forget there will be new things added in December. Those of us with topped off currencies will get the new stuff 1st
---
Super duper only works with legendary card, it doesn't stack with the legendary ammo smith perk card. It still only gives you the amount from the regular card. It's a great card none the less, all I'm saying is that they need some more cards for other builds. There's 1 ranged sneak legendary, and 1 that makes targets explode. That's it. I need some more selection. I don't use PA, or melee. So those cards are out the door. So it leaves me with some posion resist, ammo perk, and the sneak and far flung.
---
Just weapon bash them, melee isnt needed.
---
Fireproof is definitely better
---
Events I‚Äôm at , radiation rumble , uranium fever , monster mash , one violent night , heart of the swamp   Jail break is fun now the mobs are high lvl . Lvl 405 and since the patch I‚Äôm stronger then I was prior  thanks to legendary perks.
---
It's not okay for a game to crash on console. That goes against the entire point.
---
People say great legendary farm.  But aren't the legendaries always 1 star after you've reached elder rank?
---
So far the only enemies I have trouble with are robots, everything else is easily possible with one or two players!
---
I've found it's easier to just buy shotgun shells from other players. Drop 500-1000 caps on shells when you see them for 1 cap each, and you're good to go for a long while. I've started selling my acid and unused ammos to other players.
---
Gun bashing is very expensive on the ap in power armor.
---
The rad kits are pretty insulting really, let alone the Nukashine.
---
Same but I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
Maybe OP needs to clean out his console and optimize its database (idk how it works on Xbox )
---
"dilute your legendary pool"
---
Whoa. That is some next level meta gaming. And I thought I was chasing the meta when I moved away from explody to ffr weapons.
---
True but it's easier then switching to a melee weapon
---
Nah man. Just like when you hit 69 for the first time, you appreciate it as long as you can and level up by accidentally building one too many fences or something.
---
Theres some cool stuff down south of watoga train station, deffinately worth a look around.
---
Edit: bring guns
---
Not even perk card packs. How about straight up perk coins? Spread out 200 or so throughout the season, like the scrip and hold bullion is now.
---
Mine works fine with my high health build.... will probably switch to emergency protocols at some point, but in no rush due to not playing Bloodied.
---
I've been having some issues with Team Medic, though. Put it on during my first ACP event after joining a social team and it never procced for my team mates. Medic Pump, Quick Heal, and regular stim usage. None worked. I shared the card and it worked on me occasionally, but never healed my team.
---
I got everything but the Winter helmet, and couldn't trade for it.
---
I'm loving daily ops but I do worry that it'll get repetitive quickly. We're only a week into it but it's going to take a while before any additions are made to it.
---
Thankfully it only takes 8 minutes so it's far from the biggest time sink repetition I have to do daily. *Ward*...
---
Take my free rocket hand üëç
---
I use it for my power armor as I can't usually stim until my Gatling plasmas Barrell stops spinning.
---
Depends, with the the perk that let's you mitigate damage with ap, it's actually faster to swap to a melee weapon!
---
I thought explosive bait no longer worked? 
---
That sucks man.
---
And the Armor Ace power armor display is missing as well, despite being in the original data mine.
---
Whack them on SPECIALs and move some normal ones around. I did it with Strength &amp; Luck and it's allowing me to have a fairly ok build now. NGL though, spent 26 spare perk points changing my build. They should've allowed 1 free respec after such a huge update.
---
Also... sneak works fine for me. What's happening to yours?
---
I got the war glave plan 3 time in a row. That‚Äôs worst you could possibly get from ops because you can‚Äôt trade them.
---
I wish they had just kept the mods as bullion and that be it.
---
What type of armor should I try to get vanguard on? Sorry I‚Äôm not very smart in this meta stuff
---
Just delete it. It's a waste of budget and looks ugly.
---
I am seeing the opposite -- many more Legendary spawns at places I've never seen them before.  For instance, I had two legendary robots spawn during a Nuke silo run.  I'm level 250.
---
&gt;bringing real life examples into a video game with Super Mutants and Deathclaws 
---
Cringe.
---
I used a quad explosive one, scripted it 2-3 months ago. It worked fine when I used it. 20 charges definitely obliterated enemies that 5 charges wouldn't have killed.
---
As much as I want to agree because we all want the cards to be as good as possible. I was level 98 when the perk coins system went live and just the cards I had picked up since level 1 were able to level up a single card to level 3. Id imagine players with an even higher level were able to max up multiple cards already. It would take the fun away from the legendary perk system and would essentially just make them an extra perk
---
This happened to me too
---
I could see this happening
---
&gt;Have you ever had a power need that high on 76 yet?
---
Five water purifiers (50), decon shower (30), vendors (12), and a quartet of laser turrets (8) say yes. And that's before things like certain external lights that want to drain power...
---
The only time I can say that it‚Äôs definitely important to try and clear out enemies (at the objective) is when it‚Äôs freezing touch. You don‚Äôt want to be affected by the slow when the uplink is done and you need to move to the next area.
---
Also - resilient means gun bash.
---
I duplicated yeah and I‚Äôve received no warnings or any suspensions since I started playing this was the very first time and now I‚Äôm hundreds of dollars down and got no game to play
---
That perk imo is way overkill i run a PA heavy build and never die. Do you use electric absorption? It has a hidden effect that energy dmg heals you on top of filling your core. I have 300 stim packs cus enemy's just heal me lol.
---
If I wanted to run around moving and shooting I wouldn't have become a heavy, this fat arse don't go near anything that aint dead and twitching on the floor already.  (Joke)  
---
Seriously though the first event with resilient in it, when I tried running it solo I was gun bashing, twice my gun broke so had to pull out the "gutter" to finish them off, i'm convinced it was the bashing that broke the gun.
---
Ah, right. I hadn't even considered the implications for bloodied. That makes sense. I'd probably die a lot more with a jetpack too, to be fair lol.
---
Also to add, the South Mountain Lookout is an easy to access random encounters area.  Although, I‚Äôve never seen a tameable there.  
---
Going to start checking Berkeley Springs üëç
---
That‚Äôs why I use it
---
Yeah electric Absorbtion is awesome, but the robot ops are 99% anti armor ballistic Gutsies who don't care how good your armor is!
---
Question....you have any super sledges on display? I can not get mine to show, even tho its listed as a displayed item
---
I‚Äôve noticed a significant decrease in system issues myself. Perhaps I‚Äôve just been lucky.
---
I do nearly all of them if I can. Only exceptions are Project Paradise and sometimes Rad Rumble if there's nobody already there. Gots to get them Treasury Notes.
---
My second character was alot easier than my first because my partner made a heated-coil baseball bat for me so that I didn't have to worry about ammo all the time.   It made everything so much easier.
---
Shame it‚Äôs only additional electric damage, though, and the plasma crit doesn‚Äôt do anything special.
---
I learned that early on and until higher levels finding a good melee weapon will save you on ammo.    
---
Scorched tend to carry the Pump Action Shotgun and ammo. For any build getting the best shotgun you can and ammo while using melee on weaker mobs can help you save more.    
---
The Ammo Converter still isn't efficient but if you've stored up a lot of ammo you can turn it in for free ammo.    
---
My two chars carried a melee, a shotgun, and a modded Hunter/Sniper Rifle until at least level 30. If I found cheap Levendaries of these I might get them depending on how close to 50 I was. It might sound like a waste of caps and not wasting perks on them but my testing and experience has proven otherwise.    
---
My main has a Mutant's shotgun which does more damage than my rifles. There are times when you have to kill something with Melee only now that Daily Ops are here.    
---
I would only tag the ammo mats for your build and make them your focus. You can't do everything. I would suggest taking time for junk runs for your gear and ammo.    
---
Bandolier R2 really helps.    
---
Once you start getting close to 50, I'd start looking for certain legendary 3 star gear. One char has two gear pieces which have "Ammo weight -20%" and Bandolier R2. I'm maxed out in weight reduction and can easily carry thousands of rounds.    
---
Shotgun ammo is harder as Plastic x10 for every time you hit the Create option. Everyone hunts that down as it makes Bulking items for selling to vendors easier.    
---
You'll find most people sell lower tier ammo for 1 cap regardless of what it is. The munitions factor is in the far N and quite a treck to get there at low levels. IMO, until you can easily get ammo consistently carry a melee weapon. Even one Rank can help boost it and you can easily maek up that one point.
---
Why do you even need more than 100 power?
---
That was changed in one wasteland I believe they do alot less dmg in new patch at least in my experience
---
I run t65 idk if that's what's making me take no dmg.
---
You can always tell the European players!
---
I cant even sell it all 200 x 6 is more than the daily cap
---
I find it hardest for melee because I can't clear enemies from the uplinks without leaving the boost area.
---
Y'know, ammo script would totally be an in-universe thing, especially for a place like West Virginia.
---
What platform does he play on (we play on PC)? I recently started playing with my 8 year old and she would love to have a fellow Wastelander Jr.  to do stuff with.
---
And before anyone gives me crap about young kids playing yada yada, I'm always right there with her and we have serious conversations about the situations in the game. To be honest the first 30 minutes of the game was a conversation about nuclear bombs, WWII, and how even though they were made to deter bad people, good people got hurt too.  After a few somber moments she was ready to jump in still.  Talk to yer kids folks! 
---
Edit: some words
---
Really? They eat into my T-65, and my Secret Service, the lv 100 ones are the worst!
---
Failed my first Feed the People today. Had two other random people with me. Need to sit down and reevaluate my life choices.
---
I was duping yeah a few outfits and handmades nothing major by anyone‚Äôs standards from others who did ten times more and received their accounts back after a few weeks and I was brushed aside for months for reasons I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm a console player so the serious hacks or inventory stuff are off the table
---
My problem is that Armor includes Clothing. Every time you go to a player's camp it's a risk b/c you never know if they have all clothing which is a waste of caps. BGS needs to split "Clothing" and "Armor" into their own categories.
---
I bet money the modders from nexus could of created a more friendly interface then what we got from a company with a name. I wonder who the hell at Bethesda created that stupid thing and thought having to go back over and over just to sell ammo or create it. 
---
also for people like me who had to press back over and over to leave the damn terminal if you hold it it lets you skip going back through all of them  if your trying to leave the converter
---
I think the answer is painfully obvious. Get rid of "spin" when activated. Make activation act like opening a container. Every round, no matter what, gets you 1 credit. 
---
Then the terminal is how you buy ammo. Adjust prices accordingly. 
---
If they did that, id accept 1 credit per deposited round, 2 credits to buy any round. 
---
2:1 exchange. Way easier interface.
---
I had to move camps and choose another ally. Nothing else would get him to work.
---
I didn't even know we got Nukashines. Like honestly, what's the point
---
Is season 2 already live????? I can't see the rewards....i have "1/1 score-max level" (I have the game updated)
---
Looking good!
---
Thanks! Are there any spots that are better for finding tamable dogs?
---
For one, daily ops. Yes it has the perception modifier, but I can't even sneak at all, or get the damage from sneak. Someone explained it from the PTS as every creature has -1 range or something like that and they can instantly detect you. Outside of that though, vats and sneak is weird in the game now. It's probably since all of it is additive now and not mulitplied, but my sneaking is terrible now with a full sneak build. And tbh I might just move my build around and see what happens. Since basically I require it now
---
Why do you need a full set? Since you have viper paint for everything, just mix and match!
---
I‚Äôm convinced a lot of these gaming subreddits have lame ass bots directed to downvote everything when it‚Äôs posted in new. This happens here, FFXIV, Fortnite, etc. Seconds after something is posted its immediately downvoted.
---
I‚Äôm trying to find out what you guys think and what you think I could do to reach out further with Bethesda if you read my other comments you can get an easy Idea of what I did and what‚Äôs happened
---
Most people hold it the wrong way which is sad smile face. That is why the bow is sad.
---
When you run 100 good matches and run into one of the bad NW servers. you only remember the bad experience you had with it ignoring all other normal runs you had.
---
Same. I would be for everything resetting at noon along with the challenges.
---
Yes, I know that a 24 hour timer would lead to exactly 7 resets a week, while the current 20 hour reset allows for 8.4 resets a week. But how many people are really benefiting from that, and how many people would benefit more from the set time?
---
Boooooo
---
Is there a suggested donation to visit the museum?  ;)
---
Well, the game still refuses to run well on cities.
---
Those that do legit, you can grind out the plans for gauss wrappings and grind out your preferred affixes.
---
You can vendor hop and find something that fits your build but not the sellers. 
---
You can also keep an eye out for prime combinations. I've got an executioners gamma gun, it deletes bloodied builds, but otherwise automatics reign Supreme for pvp
---
Half your level still? So now you need to be lv 200 to tame ones from the mire, savage divide and cranberry bog...
---
I want that plan so bad...lol and the solar chargers...I have only gotten the burrows signs, and the vault 94 box
---
I got my unyielding ss chest piece on my first ever roll so I guess you gotta be really lucky.
---
Yes but last season we didn‚Äôt have perk coins
---
Yup, just about the most used weapon in the game.
---
So I did what you did to recreate the bug. And it does it for me as well. But now I‚Äôve ran into a new bug.  I got hit when reloading and my mag became limitless
---
Mhmm. The only other thing I can think of is my specials might be different I'm also a junkie build and always pop pyschobuff. And have the perk that doubles the effect.
---
they'd probably break something else fixing it then take forever to fix that mistake
---
Not even Chinese Stealth Armour works in Daily Ops but you're not supposed to sneak. You need to run like a bat outta hell to all objectives &amp; completely ignore any enemies in your way &amp; when you have to stay &amp; defend, there's no point sneaking then anyway. Just open fire &amp; hope for the best, and carry lots of stims!
---
If anything she is keeping him hostage.
---
that would be more fun than "Hey uhhh we need some hecking vacuum tubes, but not like the normal ones the ones that they have in Watoga. you know the other side of the map? so go get like 3 then I'll have you do the same tomorrow."
---
If you're running solo that has to be a real pain. But if you are going with a team, you could take some kind of high magazine automatic rifle for tagging.
---
On the other hand, when it's time for the resilient enemies, I hope for a melee player on my team.
---
Easy there diamond city citizen
---
They ought to use the same interface as trading or buying from a vendor. You select how much you want to get rid of with the ticker. The amount of points you have display as the currency and you are given the options of what you want to get and how much.
---
Yes, and i got to max one immediately, but given that you have 6 slots to max getting there too fast really isn't a worry, at current pace you'll be over lvl 800 before you are done.
---
I would personally rather see more challenging content instead of just more grinds.
---
Looks goofy and I want to take advantage of the new perks to free up armor rolls and perk slots.
---
Good call!
---
Time to start maining a Gatling Laser then?
---
3 shots at a rare reward.  I‚Äôve gotten two once.
---
::)
---
718 hours on pc and nothing of the sort. I've had a couple of people over the years shot at me or smack me with a dcg for a while but with pacifist on there nothing they can do. Just ignored them and went on with my day
---
Love how everyone be so helpful. My contribution: do daily ops with a group but just shoot everything once for the xp, and then collect the ammo from the bodies, plus the chunk of ammo when u finish.
---
You just got lucky.
---
I got 1st try elder every day, didn't get a rare/uncommon reward today or the first day.
---
You shouldn't balance things based on what the top 1% of players will do, nor should you balance things in general on "what bout..." hypos, by this logic nothing will ever get done
---
But she also gives the daily quest.  Can‚Äôt it drop rares?  Idk
---
I can never find one violent night, is it random or do you need to trigger it?
---
Damn how many do you have
---
I play exclusively on Xbox (so grain of salt!), but I can hold the **B button** to exit a terminal completely without going back through each prior step of the flow. I assume that other platforms have the same interaction. I'm just not sure what button that would be.
---
This also appears to work on all terminals.
---
You can also save a few steps by pressing that same button to go back a step in a flow rather than proceed to the larger ammo type selection screen. For example, I can go back to the 10mm bundle exchange page, select to deposit an amount, get the confirmation, and go back in the flow to make another deposit of the same amount; the alternative is to go forward in the flow, select the small caliber option, then 10mm, and *then* the amount.
---
I do the same thing when exchanging a different caliber of the same type of ammo. So, two steps back to .38 rounds after exchanging 10mm.
---
It's a tiny improvement in the number of steps needed to deposit ammo, but it does add up when you're sitting on thousands of rounds of multiple types.
---
I made two leather chests and both arms for two players who were 3 and 9 respectively. The odds of them having a full set or anything good at that low level is minuscule. Both of them loved it. I didn't mod it but I did give them both some food/purified water, ammo, and chems. I led them upstairs to my shop where everything tends to be 10 caps or less most of the time. I think my main finally got rid of all the plans. They bought some and I gave the rest away.    
---
They were with a level 16 who I gave supplies to. I showed them where the workshop is and the garden out back.    
---
When I do this, I do NOT expect payment from low level players. After 20 a player should know what they are doing. I wish them the best of luck.    
---
To everyone: I know the audio thing is a mixed bag of di\*\*\* but if you want to help someone efficiently, use yours. It'll make helping them more efficient. My main can create leather, metal, and robot armor from what I can remember. A melee char would benefit from the metal or robot over the leather type.    
---
You can't go wrong with food, drink, chems, and ammo.
---
I've gotten Elder first try every day with zero rare rewards, outside of three vault 94 jumpsuits.
---
I have been hearing lots of reports of the high level enemies [50+] being able to easily kill pets, even Deathclaws.
---
This was a problem before the level scaling but they're even more fragile now.
---
Weird my gf got them every day 1st try as well, guess I‚Äôll keep this luck going every day lol
---
It makes sense that a machine gun would be better than a bow.  Obviously super mutants and deathclaws aren't real, but they exist in universe.  It's not the same thing.
---
Do you have the nuclear card ?, always need one of them to let u in
---
Not that I know of personally but maybe someone here might?
---
You should sell them to vendors, you get quite a bit of Caps.
---
I was making a testicle joke.
---
You want a 50 cal, lmg, Gatling laser or plasma. 
---
You want bloodied, junkies, furious or anti armor.
---
You want bullets explode or faster fire rate. Those are the only two second star effects worth mentioning.
---
You want faster reload speed, faster movement speed while aiming or reduced weight.
---
I'll go again tonight and let you know of I find it.
---
aye. i had it as well. failed elder by 40 seconds because of it
---
I see it as free caps
---
I'm thinking maybe just 100 or even lower as there is a minimum level they can scale to as well.
---
I had 82 damage on my Handmade with all 3 cards maxed out. Took all of them off, shows 55 damage. So I'm getting a 49% bump instead of 60%.
---
If you're PC, make it 20 a piece and you got a deal. More to feed my Daily Ops ammo usage üòá
---
Well duping is against tos.  If you do it at all you're risking a permanent ban.
---
I only use it when the 40mm grenade rounds, missiles and mini nukes accumulate in my stash from dailies, maybe twice a day. And that's bad enough
---
I just want a cat in my camp... sounds like it‚Äôs too dangerous :( hopefully they follow through on the comment about improving pets they apparently made in the past. Thanks for the great write-up!
---
I used to have it happen in Fallout 4 too.  I assume it's a bug in the engine.
---
So does Gramps (when he works which is not now....again) and I get legendaries of all sorts from him.
---
As a lv 160 I've encountered lv 60-100 enemies in all those mentioned areas.
---
I have like 6 on me atm
---
???!? Wow I would never know that what it supposed to do if it wasn't for you bro /s
---
Would this work with a minigun?
---
Of course!    
---
Radaway can remove them so to keep and reduce the negative effects as best you can you must have Starched Genes R2 and Class Freak R3 equipped at all times. If you have a serum you'd like to use, you must unequip both or you'll lose the serum.    
---
IMO, the essential ones are:    
---
Marsupial. Eagle Eyes, Egghead. The healing one. At least for all ranged characters. You're best bet is to find them in player vendors and I wouldn't pay more than 500 caps/each.
---
Or like me killing 2 4 star legendaries yesterday and getting a 1 star golf club and a 2 star wooden leg. Waste of ammo.
---
This game is starting to look even more like Skyrim ;)
---
I destroyed and replaced the computer console when Deguerre was bugged like this, worked for me
---
Excellent, thanks for the info! That should help a few folks!
---
This like fine keep the limit but make it like bullion
---
Oh tell me about it. I put on all three of those and maxed Ammo Factory then made some .50 cal rounds. fucking made 10k in bullets.
---
Do you have the holotape that shows the silo status? They may be on cooldown from previous launches.
---
Would you trade reactor for anything else?
---
I agree, though I'll probably enjoy them even more when I'm not itching to see if I got the reward I wanted (Glaive plans) at the end. Eventually I suspect I'll just end up doing them for the ammo top ups.
---
Thanks and yeah, I'd love one that wouldn't get squished.
---
Maybe he just needed directions from the Blood Eagles, he‚Äôs looking a bit lost. 
---
Great photo btw, hope he found where he needed to go :)
---
Yeah I've been doing mulitple daily ops a day for the XP they give if you just hangout in there. Pretty good XP, just like to sneak around. It's my usual play style :( Im losing all my stims which is the best thing ever, since I have like 800 super stims
---
Yeah, one time i was over-encumbered in the middle of nowhere and when i checked my inventory i had like 80. I just dropped them all and never went back for em
---
I‚Äôve been on this server for about 2 hours and no one has launched a nuke they‚Äôve definitely cooled down I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that :(
---
I've done it once, and it kicked my ass.  LVL99 and ran through all my .45 ammo for my lever action.  Probably 300 rnds.  Luckily there were two lvl 100+ with me that I was able to revive at least 5 times each.  My spawn points seemed a bit chaotic.  I had to go to my plasma rifle, which I'm not perked for.  I don't think I pissed them off too much, but holy shit, what a rush.
---
You can do that? How?    
---
Also, is Gramps still broken? I have had him for 3 days now and he's giving lame old man excuses.
---
It should all reset when challenges do 12pm
---
Are you seriously laying the issue at Todd‚Äôs feet rather than your own? You did a wrong, there is no reason for you to not know you did a wrong. No one is taking away your rights or sending you to jail, they are just banning you from playing a game. Find a new game to play and try not to get banned from that one too. 
---
Sincerely,
---
Don‚Äôt give a shit.
---
And the most thematic skin that does exist that one can get early... is only for the pump-action shotty and not the combat shotty...
---
I've heard two different versions of this rumor:
---
1. If someone empties your vendor (buys everything else out) then they can see and  buy items in your stash that weren't marked for sale.    Workaround:  put some small item in every vendor at the max cost (30,0000 caps) so they can't empty your vendor
---
2. Some items from your stash will randomly be included in your vendor.  This may be in addition to your other stuff for sale, or swapped into an items slot.  Workaround:  none so far, so people are walling off their vendors.  Note that removing power to a vendor makes it harder to find your camp, but does NOT actually power down the vendors.
---
And this the main reason why we need items bank so we can safely transfer between our characters.
---
That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm wanting, sorry.
---
Hmmm, not sure then, been a looong time since I did that quest.
---
Try server hopping, or if you're able going to a private server.
---
Eh it's not a big deal. They'll have their fun and I'll have mine. Besides, I love when an event wraps up early.
---
No problem thank you
---
I've generally had pleasant experiences in-game. I've encountered maybe three or four griefers since the game was added to the Game Pass (which is when I joined!), and there has been a refreshing lack of unpleasant chatter when in teams.
---
I'm not particularly experienced myself, but I do try to spend some portion of each gameplay actively helping out lower leveled players. Usually it means either handing out resources ("Hello, welcome to Fallout 76, here's your complimentary starting pack!") or joining low levels to assist with quests and share helpful perks (either damage resistance or experience gain, depending on if they're having any difficulties).
---
inb4 "...making it the best-in-slot choice, and we want to bring it in-line with all other melee weapons."
---
yep.   we got stuck at 50 bravo upload percent for a few minutes.
---
Yeah, I totally understand that. I love giving stuff away to low level players. This is really about someone around the same level wanting to team up and then deciding they don't like how you play your game and want to "fix" it for you.
---
I‚Äôve grown quite fond of Dailey ops as long as I have team help because doing this shit alone while frozen sucks.
---
This pisses me off after I remember a couple amounts I have to convert I then have to back out check my pipboy just to go into the ammo converter again and again it‚Äôs ridiculous especially when u gain a load of ammo during events and by end of day u have accumulated so much to get rid of it can take an hr
---
Ohh well, still fun missions.
---
Use the instanced safe zones at crater, foundation, overseers house to get a good amount of free guaranteed mats. Cup packs and cups with straws in the whitespring.
---
Edit: The best plastic haul is watoga HS. But it‚Äôs pretty dangerous.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Its so random. I had 50 canned meat stew from mamma dulce event and havnt seen it in days now.
---
I just gave mine away to a level 50 I found because I hated the weight of an extra set. Good luck with the caps though
---
Those not on pc or those with low int builds: what am I, a joke to you?
---
Man, I forgot about the early game. At level 260+, resources are easy. But at level 30, I remember having to go search for scrap to repair armor and weapons.
---
I'll always help a low level too, because it happened to me early on. I forget my level, but I had a C.A.M.P. down in the dry lake by New Gad. A level 200 or so came by, toured my C.A.M.P., and dropped a low level legendary hunting rifle repaired to 200% and about 500 .308 for me. He also bought some random junk that he probably didn't need from my vending machine.
---
There's definitely a limit, it usually caps after 3-5 hits
---
Honestly the best guns to use at low levels are any guns you have access to. Ammo is a problem at the start so I would just use whatever‚Äôs available. 
---
Also, I would get into the habit of scrapping any armor and weapons you find. Each time you do, you have a large chance of learning how to mod the weapon or armor. Eventually you will have a selection of decently modded weapons and armor which helps quite a bit. 
---
As you pass level 50, you‚Äôll start being able to start customizing your character with specific damage perks for specific weapons. Until then, use any thing and everything! Enjoy the chaos while it lasts. üòÅ
---
You must be on PC, consoles don‚Äôt have this problem atm, that and you‚Äôre with Chinese hackers probably
---
Flamer only heals on gunbash.
---
So with my astonishing math skills of a 3rd grader, if my melee weapon does 100 damage. And 50 % of it is 50. 
---
The maximum damage that weapon can do is 150?
---
Not counting the enemy armor or energy resistance etc.
---
Place setting at the playground and right outside theres a couple too. Soloing it helped me learn the spawn points.
---
That is seriously cool and very scary üò∞
---
Oh wow that's sad peeps harass you as a girl too... Because Appalachia had such a strong dating scene!!
---
*Swipe right if you like mutations*
---
I have master infiltrator on atm just for the convenience.
---
Once i'm happy with my first 5 legendary perks i'll consider swapping it out, but for now being able to instantly unlock lvl 0 stuff is very handy, and not needing to mess with cards (even with perk manager) to unlock terminals for my atoms challenge is just bliss.
---
It's a bit of a drag though, especially once all the objectives are completed fully and it's just a case of waiting the next four or five minutes to count down, hoping one of the robots doesn't wander off and get downed again...
---
Still waiting for any akin for my combat shotgun.
---
Different strokes for different folks.  I like not having to go in and swap out my perks when I want to hack or lockpick, and auto-picking/hacking low level ones is a nice bonus. There's no way to know if/when loadouts are coming and I'm already having to do a lot of swapping in my C.A.M.P. when crafting.  One less instance is a lot nicer for me.
---
Nah. It‚Äôs really nice not switching perks every lock. Also,auto unlocking 0 level is just convenient.
---
So that means I can get a pet glowing deathclaw by the substation in watoga??? Hell yea
---
+ perception
---
What do the caged bulb lights look like? And where in the build menu are they
---
Level 260+, always doing events when they pop up. I really enjoy some of them.
---
They are hard for me to solo now too, and it seems like a lot of events stopped happen all but a select few
---
Thanks, but im not really after caps, trading is the exchange of goods for goods, so honestly id be happy trading for stuff that would be useful to me that might not be for them, or for plans i dont have, although i have most of the non power armor ones learned, id even give it to them for some rarer junk items like stable flux, or maybe even just a couple hours of wandering the wasteland, idk, im not all that picky
---
I dont see it as just a grind. Its added something new, and a way of allowing people to change their builds to more suit them. Whether you want to max out luck even higher, or just free up some space by getting rid of 3 lockpick/hacker perks. 
---
I think they made a good choice by implementing it the way they did, they couldve done it the same as caps/scrip/bullion by making it so you could only get a certain amount of new coins per day
---
Master infiltrator is worth the cost for nuke silo value alone. Skipping the lock picking and hacking mini games cuts a lot of time off of silo runs. Not having to touch my load out at all while in the reactor room is more valuable than anything else in the current spread of legendary perks.
---
x 2
---
I just want to get the brotherhood bunker so I can make my camp into a full on brotherhood outpost
---
I would focus on doing "Leader of the Pack" in the Forest. I starts near the fairgrounds and to those who don't know the rewards level to 50 now.    
---
IMO, that's the easiest, most efficient way to get them at early levels. Compared to normal gear you can't be too picky in what you get. You should find as many point as you can around the fairgrounds b/c you have to kill 3 wolf leaders. Each one will net you a piece of legendary equipment either armor or weapon. After that another single wolf quest should pop netting you a 4th if you're the only one doing it.    
---
IMO, all characters regardless of build should have a melee weapon on them and upgrade it to the best they can. My main is 121 and has a Legendary Axe it's been using since 50 or so.
---
Furious is 5% increased damage per hit up to 9 stacks, or 45%. And the stack resets if you intentionally or unintentionally hit any other target. As such you can only have one target at time that has the stacks.
---
Maybe if mini nukes took up the grenade slot and we could just toss them like grenades... and then Bethesda boosted the damage to match what grenades do, maybe they‚Äôd be worth it.
---
Daily Ops are great addition!  I think a little balance tweaking is needed, but those are nits.
---
Good job Bethesda! 
---
PS -- The new Daily Ops team type turns out to be a GREAT way to find players to do things.  Would love to see more of these, like for Project Paradise, ACP, etc...
---
FYI - drop the bomb event is coming up, which will likely allow multiple nukes to be launched at once. Never go afk or you‚Äôre risking your camp being nuked.
---
Restart your system
---
If you get a legendary spawn at the end of free range its worth it.
---
Yeah, the last thing I want to do is go into my perk menu before and after a hack/lockpick when most legendary perks are forgettable.
---
Switching perks on ps4 sucks enough already.
---
with everything being level 50 no matter what part of the map whats the point of turrets? They had problems taking out level 5 protectrons if they even worked at all before the patch.
---
Really you want the secret service vangaurd unless your a sneak if your sneak you want leather cus the shadowed and sleek mods work on them although I alwase recommend getting a good secret service torse and putting a jetpack on it
---
Xp is xp right?
---
Does the Daisycutter work pretty good in the event?  Because I'm looking at one of the Possum challenges where you have to kill a certain number of enemies with a mini-nuke.
---
It's good to hear that console isn't having such an issue with it. 
---
Yes it's definitely putting me with Chinese players quite regularly, I actually talk to/game with two of the guys I've met in-game. 
---
I've just noticed the use increase significantly so I thought to ask if it's the same in most parts of the world, if not then I may just use my VPN to connect to US servers or EU servers from now on.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
What I usually do when I need caps . Chemist backpack mod is great üëç
---
You have to multiply it by the base damage.  I would either take all perks etc off and check, then multiply or google how much damage the weapon does.  Assuming you have a base damage of 100, than 150 would be max, yes.
---
That's not the worst, [this](https://imgur.com/YOBnG3k) is the worst you can get 3 times in a row.
---
At least you're actually *getting* rewards.
---
I take 7mn at max in solo, (except for resilient one this is a truly nightmare this one) obviously you can't do it under 6mn because each spot take 3 mn to fully load.
---
üçø
---
Makes sense.. I use a perk loadout manager, since I keep my lockpick perks on, I only swap when I see a terminal that needs hacked. 
---
Perk swapping (with the mod) is super easy.. for example:  All I do is hit \[TAB\], T, then 2.
---
When I am finished, \[TAB\], T, 1.
---
Whatever you decided, I HIGHLY suggest Perk Loadout Manager off Nexus mods.  It is a lifesaver!  (And super easy to install)
---
Even more fun, the user interface hook is already there, it tells you when team mates are in the Daily Ops!
---
I think it's a neat idea, i'll be honest I personally wouldn't use a slot for it, but there's most definitely players who will.
---
This may sound stupid, but have you actually went back to see Modus? I don‚Äôt believe the game registers your as a general until you go into the military wing again.
---
I wait till 1 minute left on the timer if it has one. Still people show up midway through some just looking on for the free xp.
---
i would i know, because there are times i go to farm a place and come back 900 pounds over encumbered with weapons and no place around to scrap.
---
thanks to this!!!
---
I don't mind quick events and whatnot.
---
But when I go out of my way to buy an Assaultron Recall card to run an event for a friend I'd like to be able to see the enemy let alone have the 0.1 millisecond to be able to put a single round into it.
---
&gt;sometimes I just want the nuked flora
---
Yes, but you can get that flora pretty reliably by nuking the two event spots?
---
* Scorched Earth has a bunch of violet in the south-east, and a fair amount of flourescent from the mushrooms in Overgrown sundew grove.
---
* Colossal Problem meanwhile has all of the yellowcake, crimson and cobalt you could need in the surrounding area.
---
Only real reason left for nuking anywhere else is to get a place with a lot of enemies if needing a bunch of the other flux supplies.
---
That low of int shouldn't be a part of your build
---
Why not?
---
Degrading, when? I'm sitting over here with 25 impr. repair kits because my stuff isn't breaking fast enough. The only time I had something break fast was my flamer during ACP because I was using it for damage and killing wendigos. Even if my armor was breaking, white knight is op in terms of how cheap it makes repairs.
---
Yeah.  
---
I haven't had that happen to either of my characters. IMO, if they help and give you something you don't want, don't take it.
---
Awesome bunch of advice there , I‚Äôm sure it will help people out loads. Big thanks to all of you for sharing üëèüëç
---
Because int gives you xp, and now with legendary perks int is more important than ever.  Obviously I don't know what level you are, but once you get into the multi hundred levels, it'll be really hard to level up with low int.
---
Everything is easily so able until you run into the robots who swarm you with lv 100 armor peircing Gutsies!
---
&gt; that rng has not been kind to you.
---
Don't I know it. Even check out the legendaries I got too, if you want a good laugh.
---
You know, I get laughed at by people on this sub when I say I'm always broke and running out of caps. **This is why**, because I'm forced to buy everything as I'm forever cursed with terrible RNG.
---
I don't think a lot of people would say that, first you need to be level 300 to get all 6 perks slots which requires a lot of hours of gaming. 
---
Second : it requires a lot more grinding to max the perks maybe levels 900+ are the only ones who can max all 6 of them (just 8 points at much every 5 levels is crazy, requires 187 leves to max 1 legendary perk from 0). 
---
(I'm level 140 and have 250 hours which I think is quite a lot) so I would love if they make the grind easier, not everyone's above level 300 or 900, also adding 50 perk points every 25-50 levels would be great, the grinding is real. :/
---
One important thing: Keep up with the group and get to the relays. I dont care if you die left and right; just stay by the relays. (I run a PA heavy build just for the ops) and if I have a low level with I message them before we get started to just use me as a shield if they have to, just stay by the relay. üòÇ
---
Ultimately, get a PA chasis and some PA your level for the Ops. And I‚Äôm confident that someone on here would be more than willing to throw some cores at you and maybe even some raid PA or whatever youre able to use. Throw emergency protocols on the chest - and youre set for survivability in there as well.
---
Little tip about lode baring. You get the same treasury note reward no matter whether you help the robots or not. If no one is going to the event you can just go activate it and stand outside the mine for some free notes
---
I dont really need to level up to get perk coins when you get free packs from the legendary run, plus xp and INT modifiers are enough to level up tons.
---
You would think he was an ex-raider or something.
---
Maybe even the raiders didn't want him.
---
*"yet the best we ever try to do to stop him is stealing his teddy bear, pencil and coffee. Yet he somehow has new ones each day."*
---
Ever notice the doctors bag and first aid box he has are always empty? He's definitely a junkies build.
---
Technically you shouldn't be under 5 int, not 6.
---
Thank you. Its pretty dry but hopefully we see an invasion in the wasteland now.
---
Why would this be bad?  You clearly found your groove man! Same as the dude below.
---
I looked at the tables pretty carefully the first time.  I'll gladly take a second look.
---
Wouldn't be the first time something took an atrociously long time to spawn in when I have SSDs that push up to 2 to 3GB a second.   
---
Cap stashes used to take upwards of 10 minutes to spawn in, there for a while. 
---
In other words:  It isn't a hardware bottleneck.
---
The Op first was cloaking right? I'm not going crazy?
---
Yea saw that and removed it. So doesn‚Äôt work on me lol
---
YES. ALL OF THIS.
---
You don't lose anything by making a workshop
---
just have a buddy check the fast travel spawn point for your camp and move your vendors far away. I moved mine to the 2nd floor.
---
Hey, hey, don't diss fusion cores. At least they have uses.
---
That Deathclaw, no....but there is a spot nearby that could spawn one, maybe!
---
I've been noticing it too. I thought it was delayed/lagged incoming hits. Does it happen to anyone when not in power armor? I think mine happened in PA. Perhaps it really is clipping over the terrain and then doing a PA landing.
---
True!
---
While that applies to a lot of things from fallout 76, i just dont see how it makes sense here.
---
I do not understand how **anyone** looked at the current implementation of this thing and thought 'yeah that's good.'
---
Literally nothing about it makes any sense, or is in any way user friendly. 
---
Its complete crap.
---
I know right, they should give at least the skin for 3-5 weapons.
---
It's a bug. If another player completes the quest, surprise! rewards for the entire server!
---
jump
---
What level are you
---
Sounds sweet!
---
Indeed.
---
  Not to digress too much, but even this thread refers to "you do not have the right perks'.
---
  That helps ZERO.
---
What perks do you have?
---
  I have lots of perks lots of armor and losts of PA.  Im 122 and still get scratcher 2 or 3 times by an enemy and I die.
---
  Now, tell me.  I don't have the right perks.
---
Everyone else is buying merch from the actual Mothman Museum too, right?
---
We need a Wise Mothman faction in fo76.
---
180 maybe
---
It's not really really good on a melee weapon, in my opinion. But whatever the build, think to use the Adrenaline perk card rank 5 with it. They go too well together.
---
Alright I‚Äôll work on getting the secret service armor
---
I have  junkies ffr primed gat plasma.  its no legacy but it does 100 damage per shot on the queens head.  If she is going down quick and i need to secure the 1000 damage min I usually pull it out.
---
Thank you, planning over the next few weeks to revisit all the old events and the dailies including previous low level ones to see the difference and no doubt a few will be really good for farming xp and legendary drops now.
---
My kingdom for a dedicated melee player against resilient! I'm in VATs most of the time, and I've yet to remember that I cannot bash while in that mode.
---
So. Many. Deaths.
---
Yeah, that's not too bad, just wait into you get into the late 200's and 300's
---
Wut. Daily Ops doesn't degrade your gear faster...while in Ops, your gear degrades 50% slower. You might want to reread the description.
---
I thought there was reduced degradation in Daily Ops?
---
Yes.
---
It's really irritating in Daily Ops too.  Any time you have one of those "Hold (Button) to Activate" prompts, that stupid trade prompt overrides it and resets your progress.
---
Or when you're looting something, and a player passes between you and the camera... you lose the loot window.
---
I guess there's a PSA in here - if you see another player activating a beacon in Daily Ops, give them a wide berth, please.
---
Exactly.
---
just dropped them all in a Daily Op for someone to take. I dont think the RNG gods like my offering though bc no rewards for elder this time
---
Shoot better? Idk
---
&gt;when I go to farm for materials to make ammo, I end up using as much ammo as I would be able to make with materials I acquire
---
... and you get xp. That's the idea. It will be easier with every new level to get ammo.
---
I just don't team up with randos anymore.
---
This single perk covers too much. Auto looting is a good idea, but adding in loot quality bonuses is not the way to go. I would suggest that each level add a different item.
---
For example level 1 loots ammo, level 2 loots ammo and caps, level 3 loots ammo, caps, and marked junk, level 4 loots ammo, caps, marked junk, and misc items (Bobby pins, supply holotapes, claim tickets).
---
It‚Äôs not for me. Level 370. Bloodied
---
However my brother just started playing and the only good legendary he got so far was a level 10 furious so I was wondering. Thank you.
---
I was gonna post this, but you beat me to it.
---
Is it efficient? No. Is it worth all the hassle of using it? No. Is it game breaking? Nope, just a different, more annoying grindy. Could there be improvements? Absolutely. Most importantly, does it make money in the Atom shop? Nope, and that's why it won't get improved. I can't say fixed, as it does work, just is tedious as hell.
---
Here are the improvements I'd make.
---
Change clicking/set amounts to a slider. For selling, let you pick from one to all of your ammo. For buying, can either be the same as above, with each ammo type having its own value, or let the slider pick "chunks" of ammo. For example, say you can buy 5.56 in chunks for 15 points, and each round costs .5 points. You have 110 points. Slider lets you buy either 7 lumps of 30 rounds, or will let you buy all, which would be the 7 lumps of 30 for 210, and a partial lump of 10 for the last 5 points. Failing that, I'd like at minimum a display of your total ammo of said type(might be resource intensive)
---
While many will accuse you of being a 'hater,' you are 100% correct.
---
Said it a million times; even shallow research shows Bethesda has lost a GOOD chunk of change per the lesser ROI they expected on this game.  While Wastelanders was an awesome update and amazing undertaking, it was almost 1.5 years in the making and stands to likely be the only such type of 'large world change/update' that the company will invest in.
---
They are aware FO76 is not likely to draw new crowds in the numbers needed based on the game as it is, and research also shows the higher ups were VERY underwhelmed at the revenue Wastelanders and the atom shop has brought in.  So at this point, speaking strictly from a business view in trying to come out of this in the black, anticipate more minor tweaks, future requested armor/outfits at a cost of atoms, as well as repeating 'themes' that have already had a few runs (eg: double xp weekends, purveyor sales, faction themed events, etc.)
---
As legendary perks are gaining popularity among veterans and those prior bored with the game, the LAST thing they want to do is make it easier/cheaper to get that one legendary perk youre chasing, so expect more of these BS 'filler' rewards and if Bethesda does decide to make perk packs more common than they are now, all you gotta do is look at the history of repair and scrap kits and its all but obvious Bethesda is more likely than not going to start selling perk packs for atoms, similar to how they let you now 'buy' levels in the current season with atoms.
---
That actually takes the same amount to level as level 100+. Pretty sure it was datamined that the amount of xp to level up from level 100-999 is the exact same. Its either that or 100-500 is the same. Either way I'm good for a while.
---
I feel you but in fairness even ESO had 810 vet levels to max champion points......
---
How close are you?  You should be pretty close.
---
Ive only gotten 1 reward for elder and it was The Vault 94 Jumpsuit ( i like collecting all the vault jumpsuits at least)
---
That's not true.
---
Griefer do what griefer do.
---
I am 122 and had a 200 something shooting me for no reason at all.
---
  I exited the server quickly but forgot to write down the loser's screen name.
---
  There ARE good folks out there.
---
If you want I'll show you the datamines from reddit but it is in theory and in practice.
---
Not to mention the empty vodka bottles.
---
Bro/Brodette I'm down I'll pm you my psn name.
---
‚Äú50coin bundle in the rewards would be enough to rank one up‚Äù
---
I thought that every rank was 50 coins, so I mashed some ranks into my legendary agility thinking id have some left over for other cards. I realized too late that the first rank up is 50, then 100, then 150. Ugh. Were gonna need to be rank 2500-3000 to be able to rank up all a full set of legendary perk cards. And many more if you plan on switching between legendary perk cards. I dont think we should be worried about getting too many perk card packs as seasonal or other rewards. Ive got 1000 hours in on my main character and am not quite level 300. I dont ever expect to max out more than a few cards the way it is now. 
---
But its also ok to have to choose what you really want to use. We could use a little more variety in our builds.
---
Another tip , if your not sure of the route either follow your team or better yet go for a solo play through to get your bearings beforehand &amp; please when your finished doing your ops for the day drop out of the team and join a casual or events team , it‚Äôs better for you getting XP and frees up the slot for someone else wanting to do the run with a team
---
This actually helps tremendously
---
Lmao I built the ammo machine once, saw the UI, and then scrapped it immediately. Never was worth the time...
---
I find it a relief when it‚Äôs winding down and all I have to worry about is where the fuck Clifford went.
---
Actually out of curiosity I would appreciate a link if you don't mind.  I've heard that, but also heard more xp with each level.
---
God this is a fact too often disregarded here.  Unfortunately it seems most 'residents' of this subreddit who view and post/comment daily ARE that 1% of players.
---
I get it out of PA whilst sprinting every now and then, usually over hills.
---
4 maxed cards 2 cards at rank 2
---
I want to buy one off you (Xbox player here)
---
How much of last season did you do?  You get 104 points from the packs last season and 104 this season.  Did you respec a lot?
---
Oh well lol. Well killing multiple enemies can only help him lol. To make it simple, just tell him to make sure to kill as much enemies as possible before killing a boss. It can only help him ^^
---
[Edit:] as far as I remember it kind of works like a the Adrenaline perk card. He will keep the dmg buff between his targets.
---
I keep a list of rewards that I check off daily - so far ive gotten; Symptomatic, Liquid Courage, Spec Ops Mask, Caged Lights, Valley signs, and the Jumpsuit
---
And reward just in one level all the profiles pictures and photo frames. Nobody is actually going to used them nor is excited to get them. üôÑ
---
Players want more gold, perk coins, skins, appararel, a bit more good stuff. XD
---
Aw ‚òπ
---
But are you getting ghost hits then?
---
Sometimes tho its because literally nothing else better is popping up.  :/
---
And I'll be damned if I'm going to just do regular quests before I'm in the mood to. XD
---
Yeah, same...I'll just solo Earl instead.
---
When you add a new reward to a game that is boring and does not add new events, factions or areas, that is the definition of a grind.
---
Its a grind because, though the reward is new and exciting, the means to earn it is the same effing shit many have done since the BETA.
---
I agree this game is a diamond in the rough in many ways but new rewards with little to no new content is the definition of a grind.
---
they do. 
---
possibly the ones in daily ops don't but outside supermutants do
---
Im a higher level, and one of the most rewarding parts of the game for me is getting the chance to help out lower level players. I like to hype up their camp, buy stuff from their vendor (even if I dont need it, it gives them caps), and I like to head over to vault 76 when I see someone emerging to drop off some water and stims. Like someone said above, there are some bad apples, but there are a lot of great and helpful people wandering the wasteland :)

---
It takes me just as much west tek to level up 100+ characters as it does 200+ characters. It goes up every level until 50, then up at 100, up at 1000 again then completely flattens at 5000
---
My main focus is health.. I do the daily op solo, mostly because I'm trying to learn where all the signal things are... But I put my emphasis on my health so that I can withstand the attacks. The only time I really fight back is when the enemy is right up in my face and of course at the conclusion of the event. I've been really fortunate in that I've only died twice and that was at the hands of robots.
---
Did all of it. I respeced a couple of times after the respec option was available
---
I've been leaving legendaries behind I'll take them out of the enemy and drop them on the ground Incase anyone else wants them but my stash is like 50% legendaries and I can't carry no more and I cant scrap enough
---
This is fantastic!
---
I've heard that, but the wiki says something else.  I'd be very glad if I was wrong
---
It‚Äôs possible to find enemies half your level? I‚Äôve only seen same level npcs since the patch.
---
Yep ... I‚Äôve got all the skins I want for the handmade.  Gold.  Black.  Give me more for the other weapons I carry.
---
Wish I had the camp budget to make my camp look nice like that :/
---
It damages me from time to time, sounds like an extremely loud melee hit from a robot.
---
I‚Äôve been killed by it before if that‚Äôs what you mean.
---
im sad you cant tame gulpers. they are kinda cute
---
done a few west tek runs and not one drop. used to be my go to gunpowder farm. Maybe I'm just in a rut
---
Do some testing yourself, just make sure your xp modifiers are the same across all characters. I find personally it holds true.
---
What kind of lever action are you running? Also what are your SPECIAL stats? It‚Äôs hard to know where you can optimize your build without knowing anything other than you are high health.
---
Alas, I'm a PS4 player. That does sound awfully convenient.
---
I honestly don't think it takes 15k xp to level up in the mid 200's.  That is what the chart implies, right?
---
you probably want either faster reload or damage reduction while reloading. 
---
you using gun fu and adrenaline?
---
my alt is using a junkies explosive lever and at most it was taking 3 shots to put a robot down but 2 seemed to be the norm.
---
[I was talking about this almost a month ago when the PTS was still live.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ii0dzu/rank_23_of_the_new_upcoming_season_gives_you_a/) Never got an official response.
---
I think of that as stubbing your toe. Still a bug but it makes me laugh a little every time it happens.
---
Well I hadn't thought of that one, used to use macros a lot in a previous life, I'll look into it, though I'd be concerned Bethesda will notice and ban my ass.
---
Yes and I find that to be true. Around 2 and a half to 3 west tek runs
---
The Fallout ini?
---
It's like being 'rewarded' with a baby for having prom night sex. No thanks.
---
i have definitely picked some up since the patch. 
---
heading to huntersville now for SCIENCE!
---
Wish I had that problem. Heck I'm low on everything right now!üòÜ
---
Sorry friend, you are in the rite of passage stage right now. I know it kind of sucks, but you'll be playing in the big leagues soon.
---
I think I remember some stack mechanism, but wasn't a VATS user in previous Fallouts.
---
Thrown weapons count as melee damage when you‚Äôre holding a melee weapon, take advantage of the tomahawks and cleavers and it‚Äôll help you out a lot
---
That's odd, Super Mutants still drop Gunpowder for me.
---
Legendary Perk:  **Stash Whore**
---
* Rank 1 - +50 weight increase to stash
---
* Rank 2 - +50 weight increase to stash
---
* Rank  3 - +50 weight increase to stash
---
* Rank 4 - +250 weight increase to stash or + 50 weight increase additionally allows normal weight reduction perk cards to carry over to stash weight
---
Simple clean entices people to farm for rank 4.
---
Sliders are probably not going to be an option in terminals because it's not a pattern of behavior that currently exists on the platform. And, from my understanding, the ammo converter is a terminal because it adroitly avoids duplication bug issues that you see with vendors -- who **do** have sliders.
---
Keeping in mind the current behavior restraints of terminals, I'd love to see:
---
* Current ammo on-hand (as you noted!)
---
* Ability to deposit all of a single type
---
Those two improvements alone would significantly reduce the amount of time and effort in depositing ammo, especially when coupled with the smaller player-based actions I noted previously.
---
To be honest, I don't even use the ammo converter any more. I craft my own ammo or snag it from the munitions plant located next to my CAMP. Excess ammo either ends up on a vendor for exceedingly cheap or handed out for free to lowbies as part of my Welcome-to-Fallout-76 efforts.
---
**Edit:** To clarify, this is if ammo converters are a necessary evil that remain in the game. I'm absolutely in favor of the New Vegas crafting system, which allows you to scrap unneeded ammo into components for other types. Plus tiny experience gains. They're so rewarding!
---
Exactly. That's what I thought was happening. Lagged hits
---
Yeah, they're great for weighing down Vault Tec duffel bags so they don't move
---
Why would people not do events anymore.  Its xp and items you could sell and im 196.  I worship the mothman so the light house is a must event for me.
---
Going to look into this, may be an answer. I did get number key Enter bound to bash which I an improvement.
---
Okay.  I guess I'll do some more testing
---
You can build items in other people‚Äôs camps if your on a private team with them. I‚Äôd help you out brother but I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
 Close to the uranium fever event with all the mole miners. Grafton damn has one.  Down south around mount Blair has a bunch and cores also. People can also craft then for you.  Start and finish the quest for the excavator armor.
---
Yeh, I stumbled into Watoga a couple of days ago. Not a good decision. I was torn to shreds by an Assaultron. I made it to the Mayor‚Äôs Office, but I bounced after that. Planning to go back once I‚Äôve leveled my energy resistance some.
---
I couldn't see where I was being attacked from. It was frustrating but there needs to be challenges like this for those who find this game easy. For the most part it is easy but the bosses and now Daily Ops can be difficult.
---
Killed 8 and 3 dropped gunpowder (im on xbone)
---
Going to look into macros as others have suggested or a foot pedal to hold the crit active, should be a fun experiment regardless üëç
---
It has been getting slower for me, but at least one a week I find something new since I took a different path or just was exploring. My favorite is the TV sitcom room set up on a cliff in toxic valley.
---
Yeah. Now I just sell the 9000 stims I get from ops instead
---
Just did the daily ops and two of them dropped some
---
Damn rly? I remember when I was like lvl 23 and made it a mission to explore the pumpkin house area. You can also place your camp right at the edge of the pumpkin patch over there. Good for anyone who wanted to grow pumpkins instead of gourds. If you wanna build a serious defense against scorched
---
I just cleared the mutants by the airport and the ones for pop a squatter. They still do.
---
At this point any plans we have should work with legendary modules. Weapons included. The system is already in place just needs to be expanded.
---
Ah new to PC games I see. There are always exploits and injectors for these types of games on PC.
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy sneaking around. I‚Äôm much more of a Kool Aid Man sort of player. But I have experienced the advantages of the occasional sneak in this game. Good tip, thanks.
---
I'll be hopping on after a quick nw match if you wanna be bombarded by extra stimpacks and plans
---
Perk card packs for 100 gold bullion please!!
---
I like watching pointless arguments too. So, I'm glad to be of service lol
---
When the 1% are willing to light up reddit and online forums / steam to voice their opinions with abandon, it becomes the feedback they hear, the problems they need to fix.
---
Yeah they have that wide eyed goofy look lol
---
Agreed 100%. The first day sucked with the melee robots ( although still got elder ) just was annoying. But every other day so far has been a blast. Been running them 5-10 times a day with multiple friends even after unlocking elder just to see the lowest time we can get. 
---
It took two years but we‚Äôre finally starting to get honest to goodness end game content.
---
I think I just picked one up earlier today. I‚Äôll give it a spin, although I will say I didn‚Äôt like using them in FO4. Suppose I should try each different weapon type available. Thanks.
---
If you don't like sneaking I recommend power armor
---
buy them off people who do daily ops =0 
---
i was cleaning my inventory today and saw i had 68 grenades. i was like 'wat'
---
I have to believe there is some mechanic somewhere that will allow a tame to work out, but its Bethesda and I doubt it and it would suck for tames to be high level only.
---
What's not to love about her yelling ***SWARMIN' VERMIN*** in your ear for the 800th time?
---
I think seeded servers are a thing. It was taking a long time to get a full set of unyielding. Only had one piece. Then one day I crafted and got a unyielding and crafted all the other pieces and now have full unyielding SS.
---
Yeah but Glowing Deathclaws are tamable!
---
Maybe a Telsa Trap can do the trick.
---
I would prefer a caps/vendor/businessman Legendary Perk ..... that slowly eliminates the tax and leaves you with more caps on regular purchases as well.
---
Wait, where is there matchmaking?
---
There's definitely some untapped damage in those crits. Good luck!
---
some ammo types don't drop apparently. have you used a diff weapon?
---
One less negative person. Cool.
---
It does suck using a bunch more ammo, but these things we're battling are huge compared to us puny humans. It should take more ammo to bring them down.
---
I finally got myself a proper bloodied build before the update and was 1-shotting everything. All of the challenge was gone. Now it's challenging again.
---
Yup. Some how after all this time I missed it.
---
Sucks. I just finished a West Tek run and picked up plenty of gun powder (on Xbox).
---
PS4. Part of the fun of Fallout games for me is shooting things to death. I have never tried a melee build. I suppose I should test it out.
---
This is a brilliant well informed post that makes want to sacrifice 6 perk coins to try and get one. Thank you.
---
One thing I am unsure of. Am I supposed to clear the enemies my pet may encounter on the way back to camp? Or maybe stay a little way ahead of them? Sorry if that's a dumb question.
---
Yes they are still good, especially if they have FFR or explosive on the second slot.
---
Well elder is supposed to require teamplay.... yes some other missions have been done solo but they are intended for groups
---
Sorry I know my response isn‚Äôt helpful. No real advice from me.
---
nope always have used a shotgun , and today not once did they drop shotgun shells
---
I just did Jail Break solo (no one showed even after I joined an event group) and it was so much harder now. I‚Äôve spec‚Äôd heavy into shotguns because my beloved lever rifle is now spitting pebbles. So without a decent long range gun I was taking a lot of damage from the ones on the towers. I had to run up to each one to blast them in the face.
---
I did manage to finish it but I really miss being able to use an effective rifle.
---
Did you buy Fallout 76 on Steam from the start or is it an old account you passed over from the Bethesda Launcher?
---
Honestly have the time I just like nuking cool places to watch the mushroom cloud, nuking shit is like my favorite part of this game. If you want a good view when someone nukes the monogah mine you should stand outside the rusty pick it looks amazing the land view lighthouse is also a good place to watch
---
What platform you on? I am actually looking for 2 of these to get my hands on
---
Haven‚Äôt discovered Luck Hole yet. Nor have I gotten the Scrapper perk. I will move that up the list. Thanks.
---
The disconnected from servers where you see waiting for controls or whatever is because some asshole people have found a work around for an old dupe method that was notorious for server crashing.   
---
I pray this does not become a public dupe exploit on all systems, only reason I know and it has been reported is well I have shady ass friends and even they are not to happy about it since it interferes with everyone. And yes this dupe method has been reported already.   
---
Also don't PM me asking I already get enough of that from thirsty ass youtubers.
---
What‚Äôs the name of that holotape?
---
NO! To all of this. No vacuum cleaners; no loot pets.
---
This is just my personal opinion. Besides Bethesda would never go for it anyway. They are all about slowing the player down and keeping them in game, per day for as long as possible.
---
Oh what do you mean? I thought there was only one variant of thorn
---
I'll never buy junk (unless it's minimum priced to flip it).... but those huge junk numbers get me curious, especially if there's like 1-2 other things (weapon, plan, etc).  so I go. Ya got me...
---
Nah its jus that ultracite calibrated r mad expensive
---
Episode 5 is currently in editing and post.! look forward to it soon!!! Appreciate the love!!
