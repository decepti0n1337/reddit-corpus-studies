But then that'd take up carry wight I can't use power amour because I only have one fusion core. I'm like level 90 by the way.

Coal can be used for crafting water filters: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Water_filter
---
Have the same problem, still lol
---
It's a neat idea but at the current rate of how things are going you're giving them a bit too much credit I feel :/ 
---

---
I'm not saying this to be a contrarian or be rude, I'm simply a bit discouraged, do you think they'll start doing better soon? 
---
Thanks, Second person to mention this, will submit ticket for it later, hopefully they will scold me again for submitting tickets, lol
---
Yeah but under that logic(no rudeness intended here) laser rifles shouldn’t be affected either
---
Yeah with the robot and such, your ideas aren’t bad but either way someone will complain about it. 
---
It always breaks it and I have to repair it.
---
&gt; typical
---
Hm? Where did that come from?
---
&gt; Have you not played any of the other games?
---
Like Fallout Shelter? Sure I have, why do you ask?
---
&gt; Or ESO?
---
Why are we talking about their MMORPG all of a sudden?
---
Only patched explosive one not others
---
Remember. It puts the lotion on or it gets the hose. 
---
But I agree with most of what you said.  
---
Yup, that what I do.  I have Hard Bargain on level 1 and they sell for 28.  And they don’t heavily impact your carry weight. 
---
"The fewer players are left, the more we have to make them grind, to keep our play time numbers up."

I've killer her 8-10 times since last patch....she's usually dead within 10 minutes max and the normal amount of people show up every time.
---
Is it lazy coding? Probably yes. So much of it is a holdover from fallout 4. But I can't begin to estimate the cost / benefit on what it would take on changing that order. It might just be a couple lines in one spot or might be a complete rework of everything.
---
But fast traveling to a friends CAMP means it’s okay to be sealed inside the floor/wall/generator/tato plant?
---
There is a serious but transient problem with assets not loading into the cell but being able to interact with you. I've routinely experienced getting very low-res textures on buildings and such, and no detail at all of interiors (like Watoga train station) after walking at regular speed into the area from far enough away that the cell hadn't been loaded before that. Sometimes, if there are enemies in the area, they can fight you before you know they're there. I blundered into what I later found was a super mutant camp with at least one minigun-wielding boss, but no enemies and no structures loaded - I just found out that I was taking massive damage for no apparent reason.
---
I do agree that enemies do seem to have some kind of radar to locate you despite your stealth/avoidance abilities.
---
Fun punctuated by bugs. Once it’s fixed I’m sure it’ll be easier for me to play. 
---
I’m not putting myself on a cross here, just taking a break while the game gets more stable and I hit less bugs and frustration. 
---
Logical, I've got stuck under my foundation before because I moved into to before it popped into existence.
---
I didn’t see it mentioned but inside white spring enclave bunker, only the middle vendor/modus station is working (for example medical bay) the outer 2 stations always say vendor is busy.... also because of this only one person can use them at at time 
---
3 pounds? That's the Blade of Bastet. Or any dagger at high levels. Honestly, melee is ridiculously strong.
---
Nobody knows what you’ve done already.  It’s an impossible question and kind of silly.
---
what has that to do with this post and whi would you think we would care about it
---
There’s one like that on the highway south east of white springs near some trucks and cars but it’s dead
---
Getting fusion cores are fairly simple.  I’ve never run out but I did notice that with this last patch I’m running low.  I pull them off of frames when I find the,m plus out of generators if I’m lucky enough that to get there first.  I keep the lowest charged ones on me while I travel and the higher ones in my stash. If I run low I swing by a translation and grab one out of my stash.  
---
I would love this and I absolutely agree this game needs some DLC soon to spice this dull wasteland up a bit, but they really need to solidify this vanilla game fast before they add a bunch of new stuff
---
I am below level 10 so if pretty much anyone beats me to a spot, the mobs are too tough for me. I have been trying to follow the main quest line but several times I have had to bail and find other things to do because  I am running into bad guys 20 levels above me. 
---
I honestly don't know how I would change things, but at low levels, it can make for some irritation. 
---
Please read my post again. I didn't say i believe either side. Not bethesda, not the players on this subreddit or anyone else without evidence. 
---
The key thing is evidence like you said. Which neither provided. So my qn is why would you believe a company that has messed up badly and tried the typical pr recovery which is just simply a reactionary response and not the best a company can do which is prevention and anticipation of potential problems. I hope at this point we can all agree that bethesda is plain lazy and greedy like most of the other game companies that have grown too complacent. 
---
And it's not that you shldnt't use companies that have messed up. But only go back to them when they have made sufficient improvements. The key word here is sufficient. Is whatever bethesda doing now sufficient? Imo no. Because so far what they have done is just fixing their mistakes due to the immense backlash. If they had cared, would you think they would have released a game with gamebreaking bugs? And they didn't even fix bugs provided by modders years ago. How lazy can you be? They have only done enough imo if they release a game that does not have game breaking bugs or at least just 1 or 2 that they would fix after a single 1 wk or a month and not taking more than 2.5 months and still have past bugs coming back into the game.
---
I have said this countless of times. Don't place your faith in businesses without any premise, they are acting in their self interest: to earn profits afterall. They only care about their customers when it earns them profits. In this case they need to polish their tarnished reputation. Think on this, please. 
---
My dad just said the coach looks like a Goodyear mechanic.

Hit select it brings up a simpler pipboy screen that loads much faster
---
Grinding loot to sacrifice to a faction box would be a worthwhile way to spend gear you can't carry. People have already been donating to the Flatwoods Overseer's Stash since the beginning of the game - that should net you Responders reputation.
---
Isn’t that included in having the spawn point be just outside the camp area? 
---
What you say is right, but that was before she was betrayed, remember you find her clutching her mother.
---
The Rams are only in the Super Bowl because of Bethesda-levels of incompetence from the refs in the NFCCG so I guess it fits.
---
It isn’t new per se but I finally picked up Far Cry 5 and am loving the hell out of it. Beautiful world, amazing gunplay, character customization, real co-op ... I’m looking forward to New Dawn being the Fallout we actually wanted, and FC5 is keeping that hope alive so far. 
---
PC 1920*1080. I've already applied that little cfg tweak to make the sensitivities matchup, but in PA when crouched only, it's still off.
---
Yea, I think that's it since it was running fine earlier for me too. I wish they would focus on performance instead of bug fixes right now.
---
It's because the superbowls's on. No one wants to see the Pat's win again so everyone is going online, killing connectivity.
---
;) 
---
I've tried soloing a few times before the patch and failed everytime. Even now at lvl 109 I wouldn't go without at least a cushion of 35 stims and a few hundred extra rds of ammo. I hate those gutsys that just shave off your hp as if the armor isnt there.
---
Well this gives me hope. I've had two 1* TS drops so far. They were a level 25 double barrel &amp; a level 35 crossbow and I've yet to find any explosive weapons. I don't dupe and I don't buy with the money I bust my ass to bring home on Ebay either. I'll use caps with another player if I ever get the chance because it's an intended in game mechanic. The best legendary I ever had was a 3* Vanguard Heavy Combat Armor Chest Piece. It had 90% weight reduction &amp; +1 strength. Then the food processor machine at Mama Dolce's ate it when I was doing the Feed the People Event and I haven't been the same since. 
---
Something in there. Like I said, I don't know. I can't pretend to understand their thinking.
---
yeah it’s another of Bethesda’s „fixes“. making sure everything feels like a chore
---
*oh no, there are two problems and only the one I was exploiting got fixed*
---
What’s considered mid level?
---
&gt; Or I could have it for a tyrannical government and police force that is out of control
---
You're absolutely kidding yourself if you think you could actually defend against a situation like that or with Russia with just your gun. Organized terrorist groups already hiding behind guerilla tactics know they can barely defend themselves let alone do significant damage to 1st world government forces without explosive devices. What're you going to do if the "tyrannical" government turns against you? Slow-mo pop all the corrupt government forces in the head like you're Jason mother fucking Bourne over and over or something.

I second this with my own experience. I have base 6 charisma and I have a full set of unyielding gear I put on every daily reset to sell my junk. I use hard bargain 3. I no longer have to pop a grape mentat/ beer/ or other potions. 
---
bad idea. The fewer the players the fewer invest their real money into the shop. Thus less revenue. Bye bye additional content 
---
Just wait till they try and loot the football and they get the infinite circling box.   
---
Wow, I just read through that and even though I don't 100% understand it all (not a programmer), I *do* use targeting HUD and have basically since I first got me X-01 PA! I often get the blue screens and server d/c's, so I wonder if this has been my issue the whole time?? Someone else suggested the same thing and I think I am going to try to make a new hat without it and run around with that for a while, see what happens.
---
Thanks a ton for digging into this so much and for the info! Hope they can get it fixed soon. :/
---
This is amazing. You’re doing so much work in spite of Bethesda basically ignoring you. 
---
All this work you do is easily worth what 500, maybe even 1000 atoms?! Toss in a canvas bag for good measure. 
---
But in all seriousness thanks for this. Your username is fitting as you’re bringing life back to this game. Or at least trying to. Hopefully Bethesda will recognize this eventually. 
---
Me and a group of people farmed her twice. We were going to do it a third but half of us had to go
---
me neither. But what we can understand is their actions. Everything has been done to increase the grind. Nothing has been done to increase the fun. 
---
What does that say to you?
---
HAHAHAHAHA. Gold
---
Mine is normal so I think is more a random bug and not everyone is affected
---
The warehouse has the warehouse door walls that are vertical al half walls with a bar across the top if I remember right
---
I stumbled across a player with just 5 on them so I did the playfull shooting emote and they did thumbs up, meaning they wanted me to help them. I love how the community is making the emote wheel work.
---

---
There are issues on so many fronts, if they focused on performance, people would be complaining about common bugs like corpses disappearing too quickly or the SBQ flying off into an unreachable area, or lack of content or terrible weapon and armour and economy balance.
---
Though, you're right. Performance would be nice too. However for me after the hotfix it's about as good as I've ever seen it. Still have the occasional server lag but haven't been disconnected once or have the game crash on me, which was common prior to the recent patch.
---
You sir are on to something #makefallout76greatforonce
---
I play overwatch semi-regularly, and assassins creed odyssey every so often. I’ve slowly went from a gamer, to someone interested more in electronic hardware. I spend a lot more time fixing old gadgets and computers than playing games.
---
My working theory - I hunt the Behemoth regularly near my CAMP location (Twin Lakes). When he runs at me up the hill and subsequently dies, he falls through the map, and respawns, dead, in the lake where he comes from. And I can loot him. So perhaps same thing is happening for other big enemies... they are teleporting back to original spawn location?

I have an anti-armor handmade. Not sure how effective it is. I should do a comparison run.

Happened alot to me when jumping in nukezones with PA on and marsupial and strange in numbers I usually freeze crash when my character starts to fall down. 
---
Havent seen this after the patch though.
---
They need to nerf Brady 
---
The part that will make you cry is the flux needed.  I can't seem to find anyone dropping nukes anymore.  So collecting flux is a PITA.

I absolutely can (and do) play without those perks.

Why can't there be grind and fun? Isn't there a middle ground somewhere. I like grind in some areas and I go looking for it when I want it. But I don't want grind EVERYWHERE. It says there's some very halfway thinking going on to me. Maybe its lazy? Maybe its spite? 
---
Yeah, your right. I ended up looking it up and Wikipedia said that in fiction it is common for any weapon with a stock that is held up to the shoulder to be called a rifle. 
---
Aaaaaanyway, the railway rifle *should* be affected with some perk either rifle or heavy weapon.
---
It’s the game of the year.
---
One because it’s fun.
---
And two because it’s pissed off so many people in the process.
---
Too late. Game died.
---
Same here bruh, I haven't found shiizzzz
---
Yes... that’s what I do. And it’s a half-decent workaround. I think it’d be nice to have a dedicated emote that everyone knew meant, “It’s OK... you can kill me”.
---
The interaction between players in this game is amazing. I have really enjoyed helping lower level players out, if they have wanted me to. It is an ‘End Game in itself.
---
You won't loose mutations but rad-x suppresses them. Not sure if its a bug or intended.
---
Tank Killer works with automatics..? I'm sure is isn't supposed to, but wouldn't be surprised if it does.
---
This exactly. I've gotten a few legendary ultracite pistols. 2 1*s, 1 2*, and 1 3*. I've never even seen a non-legendary ultracite gatling laser.

So just that one thing.

I’m also level 95 and got my first TSE drop today! 
---
Except by “drop” I mean by some miracle when I was selling shit to the whitesprings station vendor, it had a 3* TSE combat rifle in its inventory that some kind and/or insane soul must’ve sold to it earlier. So I finally got one. My actual drops are normally like nocturnal lead pipes and shit. 
---
The game is very poorly optimized, of course more RAM will help but even with 16go ddr4, i7 6700k and 1070TI, I had bad performances before some tweaks.

This Super Bowl has been brought to you by Vault-Tec.

How many atoms for the whole team to get that paint?

Kudos to you for putting in all that work.

I made it into throwing knives that way i could still kill something with it
---
Except explosive shotguns.
---
If the supply drop is not yours, it will say STEAL when you try to open it. This was introduced in mid-january iirc
---
I really like that idea!
---
I haven't experienced that, but it sounds similar. I *think* that these all spawned when I passed a trigger point. I had clicked on VATS before hitting the stealth boy, and no enemies were within range. What you're describing could explain it too, I guess. 
---
I just travel to Whitespring, and stand on top of the bus doing the angry emote. It looks like I'm just really frustrated and accidentally got a 10 cap bounty. Which is truth.
---
Eventually, someone will show up, and in my case exclaim, "You know I'm here to claim, right?!" TSE blows up the bus, and me. All good.
---
You mean your rad depression?
---
Not gonna lie. I saw the title and assumed this was gonna be some rule34 stuff
---
Is the explosive SMG any good? I can't recall what level it's for, but I feel like the FO76 posts I see now are about these explosive weapons so I'm kinda curious.
---
This is a really cool build. I also laughed my ass off at your text commentary. &lt;3
---
I mean like if I could take one cure and be rid of it forever.

I got my rad resistence up to over 10k. (38 Rad shields.) Still took 4 rads per second. I was able to mostly survive in a rad zone by popping rad away diluted. Working to build up to 60 - 100 rad shields. 
---
Well she was just shot and very quickly dying so even if we do find her like that it doesn't really mean she learned her lesson and became a much better person right before she died. Who knows–maybe if she had a chance to do it all over again she would still betray her mother but also plan out killing the boy and the raider leader so she could become leader of the raiders.
---
They weigh .1 each, I think that might be lighter than the raw resources used to craft it
---
What this guy said. It's not hard.....
---
good
---
There seem to be a lot of ways for us to convey what we want people to do... but, I always wonder if it might be better to have a dedicated emote (especially when you are trying to persuade a lower level player to kill you... as I think they suspect that you’re setting a trap for them).
---
I did one late last night. There were maybe 9 people there. 5 were hiding in the back of the shed while the other 4 tried to bring her down. Got her through the first bar and then about halfway through the second, it stuck. That has now happened 2 out of the last 4 times I have done it. Wasted a crap ton of Ultracite ammo. Just not worth it anymore. 
---
i feel the opposite, solo runs have been pretty easy, the toughest enemy being the assualtrons. (my build is usually unarmed but for nuke silos i use my all rise and the slugger perks and run around in power armor.) i’ve been able to solo the nuke silos for the past 7 silos, the only 7 that i’ve done . you have to be fast during the segments because the longer you take, the more robots spawn. also try turning off the turrets by hacking the terminals, makes it significantly easier :) 
---
Begin again.
---
I totally agree with you! It’s not anymore . Now I’m farming whitesprings soooooooooooooooooo
---
Who's the cutie on the right?
---
I do but because you like and enjoy something it doesn't mean that you can't be angry or disappointed at some decisions Bethesda has made. i'm having fun and I really hope they fix this mess of a patch and continue improving the game like they did before, and I really understand people being angry at it.
---
do people actually care about bobby pins lmao? they added like 3 extra whole pounds O\_O holy shit this game is broken
---
So you replied to yourself and wished you could give yourself a prize?
---
I agree 100%, too much work IMO but I appreciated having him their haha.
---
Screws in Morgantown? Nah. Hit up the Charleston Herald building and Bog Town.
---
This is why PvP in this game is utter nonsense - its just flat out cheese and players buying/trading/duping their way victory.
---
I got the shocks down to 5250.
---
I think it also happens if you switch weapons during a reload.
---
What level hacking do you need? Looking to do my first silo soon.
---
It was infuriatingly tragic, because if you pay attention you realize the pre war society *would produce someone exactly like that*
---
Okay? Obviously everyone is the same as you I shall remember never to help others in games or real life because people all want to earn rewards for themselves. Thanks for your wisdom, I shan't donate to cancer research since they need to earn funding..
---
Post patch the only reason to sneak is night eyes.
---
I personally love my dual Furious Explosive Revolvers (Western and .44). Gets the job done nicely in many scenarios 
---
Yeah they also said the F76 engin "just worked". Guess what? it doesn't.
---
That is a masterpiece in its own right
---
The nerf is ridiculous.  They went way overboard.  There really is no point in fighting her anymore.  You're just sinking a shitload of ammo and weapon durability into something for little reward - IF you can kill her.  I've seen groups giving up a few times since the nerf.  They try for ten minutes, her health doesn't go down much, everyone figures what's the use and fucks off.
---
If you’re on the PS4. I would gladly help you rebuild. I have a lot of supply to offer.
---
I shouldn’t have to undress down to my underwear (to look as vulnerable as possible), just to reassure other players that I am not a threat.
---
I know it could be abused... but, a player with a 5 or 10 cap bounty probably has it by accident.
---
I hear nuking Monoghan is good too. The power plant supposedly spawns glowing ones
---
3 out of the 4 terminals need all 3 levels of hacker,  one of them needs level 1 but it’s behind a level 3 locked door. just switch the cards out whenever necessary 
---
I didnt die when I should have. I don't normally go to the Whitespring because its always swamped with high level enemies and I am weak as hell (I run a sneaky shotty sniper and rely on cripple perks and manual aiming to survive without power armour)  but I was in the area and had a decent supply of ammo...
---
About an hour later, I'm running into the golf club and line my sights up with a lvl 62 charred and open fire with my combat shotgun. Phuah (it's suppressed) phuah, click. Look down, outta ammo, and the whole place is waking up. I run outta there, trying to jump on the shrubs to the pool wall, but they are all over me and their friend glowing wendigo is coming over to say hello.
---
At the last second, all I can hear is my heart and the screen is nothing but a blur, I manage to make it up on the wall slam a stimpack and see my health go up about 5 hp. Damn rads. Pop a radawa...no radaway. Well shit, I guess ill see what I have to get me out of this mess. No 45 for my lever, no shells, no grenades. Just a suppressors auto 10mm I must have picked up from a legendary. 
---
Then a lvl 115 in PA comes by swinging an ax and kills everything in one hit. Thumbs up dude. Thumbs up.
---
What a stupid, stupid, stupid idea.
---
I'm sure Bethesda is doing it.
---
Morgantown is good for XP . Doesn’t spawn a lot of legendary tho 
---
If it's not big deal why are you calling me out on my anxiety and attacking me? Why not just go on to the next post? Why dont you hop off your computer and do something productive instead of being a dick and attacking me over something so trivial...
---
Surface never. Vault forever.
---
If I recall correctly, the phrasing was something like they are temporarily removing explosive energy weapons from the pool while they rework them. So they might come back different, which would also make yours changed. Either way, I have a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma that still demolishes even after the nerf
---
Read the topic first than comment. There is at least 6 things in that topic that was proven to be not true, 
---
I also used the pocket glitch and the "store as much as you want in stash" glitch. I'm still working to get me stash under 600 so I can actually use it. Started at 1200 and it's currently around 700.
---
Just another voice in the crowd, but yes, I've stopped playing unless some friends want to get together. It's just not a fun game. I can loot, kill, repair, and build all week, but ultimately my player has no lasting impact on the world. Kill the Queen and nothing changes. Kill a scorchbeast at a fissure, and two minutes later there's another one. And running around on the east side of the map quickly depletes resources I gathered on the west side. I should have named my character Sisyphus.
---
you sure it was consumed and not just moved up the list alphabetically (known)
---
It is an awesome idea.
---
Until 12 year olds.
---
I think factions may be where we first see some kind of karma system. I like the idea of bringing the personal karma system as well, could be the difference between a fan bringing you some needed supplies and a gang of regulators come to kill you.
---
When I have the spinning thing, I just drop one item (usually a grenade or some food) from my inventory, and all corpses become lootable like usual, I thought this was well known :)
---
Great idea!! I’m not a big PvPer and this would make the game so much better.  Simple idea. Big improvement. 
---
Yes they said that while bullets exploding made sense, laser beams exploding on impact did not, maybe they replace it with “penetrating beams” that chew away at the Armor , or a “furious” rework where it heats the target so the more you hit it the more damage it takes, regardless if you miss a few shots 
---
It's not absolutely required but if you don't like being forced to carefully budget how much of that type you're carrying while also rationing its use–because without those perks it's not all that many–then it's kinda 'required' in that sense.
---
I don't want Karma, it's never implemented correctly and only limits playstyle for the player.
---
Post nerf not worth it.
---
Even with full powered TSE she'd take a ton of ammo it seemed.
---
Fuck it... Glad I got all those quests and shot done before Bethesda fucked things up 
---
Your welcome. That's what gamers do. When you have time, check out the official Fallout wiki, the fallout 76 pages are kinda incomplete and messy, but they are better than nothing. They don't have everything so, keep asking away.  
---
The grenade launcher is a rifle too.
---
But i think it's supposed to be a heavy weapon as its enormous.
---
Whats the weight on it?
---
Been defending this game but damn can we just have a decent base building mechanic that lets you build more than a square block. Why can certain objects sink into the ground but others are near impossible to place flat (tents). Everytime I think I have a good idea for a camp I dont because the system is somehow more limited than Fallout 4. Fine for them to sell furniture like its sims though.
---
Could very well have been now that I think about it. Had multiple plans with 2s and 3s, realized it disappeared after using it, had my wife use a few I gave her and did the same thing.
---
Let me check the inventory...
---
Please give us a perk card where we have a 30% chance to throw in a kick after every successful unarmed attack for additional damage please
---
13 pounds
---
I read all of that 18 days ago.
---
U 100% sure all your hardware is 100% I had a dying psu to blame for majority of my issues... 
---
I feel like the relatively high damage of Unarmed versus one-handed kind of makes up for the lack of 9 Iron Fist perks.
---
Although I would be lying if I didn't think the card should be 10/20/30 instead of 10/15/20.
---
"Man Kicks'n'Fists Deathclaw to death"

It wasn't tragic if you don't buy into it. I never once thought "of course she would do that." I did think "Why is she doing this?".

yeah mate send proof and actual evidence , your mate saying it happens isn’t a reliable source , also given that the whitespring is like the number one spot in the map for players (most of which are in power armour) I don’t believe that this is a ‘guaranteed crash’ or even that this bug exists.
---
Well every other weapon type has it, so why not unarmed? Just because it does tons of damage doesn't mean you cant add damage cards
---
Eh. That doesn't bother me so much. I'd still be somewhat entertained by what they had to say.
---
I mean, it's possible. The unseen wrecker haha.
---
This. Run to her corpse asap and spam that  pick up button. I've only not gotten loot from her once.
---
That's how I feel about my Quad Explosive Cryolator. At this point I'm just a dragon protecting a bunch of legendary weapons I can barely hold onto because of small hand carry weight problems. But I look forward to every update!
---
Will be OP
---
Yeah, I can definitely get my fix of a post apocalyptic wasteland survival with retro-futuristic settings from a...futuristic space game.
---
Why?  It only specifies rifles, not non-automatic rifles.
---
:)
---
That’s a pretty absurd comment. I wasn’t judging what you did or your holier than thou post, just stating my opinion in relation to what you say happened. 
---
Have you only played for 5 minutes?
---
This was before the stacking bobblehead fix so that is also a possible answer to the DMG.
---
Melee itself is already op
---
Good to know. I was about to change out my T-HUD for this, but I guess I'll try something else.
---
I'm inclined to agree, that sounds about right.
---
get a hook
---
Well, it's not tied to normal dps.  The only common pattern I've seen is shot count roughly dependent on weapon type.  With maxed perks and mods it sorta kinda fits.
---
On PC here and not having this problem. Had a plan. Mistakenly bought a second copy without learning the one I already had. Learned it and it consumed only one and moved the other to known. 
---
I feel for you.
---
I went through hell to make it to 18.
---
Get a rifle and hit stuff from a distance that others are killing.  If you get a shot in, you get xp
---
You're so far in denial you passed egypt-twice! Flourishing games don't drop to 25$ and lower post launch. Even Destiny 2 with all it's problems didn't fare so badly. The player base is dying bed Bethesda consistently screws the pooch-IF they stop screwing up, then they might persuade fans to return, but not before.
---
im indifferent toward the perk, but definitely getting an upvote for "fisting a scorchbeast"  
---
That is indeed what has happened. Now I feel silly. Thanks!
---
Oh ok. Maybe it will be a regular rifle then.
---
Unfortunately it's been bugged since launch. No perks affect its damage
---
wholesome.
---
Where is it located? 
---
Did you miss the memo that everyone who's ever played a fallout game has to "defend" 76/Bethesda until they finish their dramatic essay on how the slow patching of a game that they've spent 120 hours playing has ruined their life?
---
Thus my question. I couldn't recall, but I kept think it doesn't.
---
No problem, if you have any other questions message me.
---
Won’t ever happen. Bethesda got sued by the artist. 
---
I wish they wouldn't try to make sense of their weapons. That way leads to madness. And nerfing the hell out of the magic sledgehammer with a rocket attacked to it.
---
WhiteSprings is the best place to get all you need to sell
---
SCANDALOUS!
---
The burden of proof lies on the initial person claiming they were banned
---
Well you asked for proof and I give you one. 18 days old or not does not matter. You can even check recently some users claiming they were banned because they crafted many items and that was also proven to be wrong by bethesda.
---
The "caution" warning is getting stuck on when I crouch. It's been happening a lot lately. Xbox one. 
---
Yeah, but try finding the pocketed mod.
---
Been seeing many things like that in Watoga.
---
It would be difficult for me to make you a weapon on my game and give it to you. Lol.
---
Leather's not bad, that's true. Robot would be ok except the heavy torso has those dumb spikes on the back. 
---
Charisma is silly when vendors are all robots....
---
Literally everyone in this game locked themselves in a fridge, a store cupboard and committed suicide. It got old the first 10 times.
---
You are me.  What a dumbass.
---
Is there a bug with that mutation and rad worms at the moment? I'm melee and used to be able to one shot level 62 ghouls but in the last two days it now requires two hits. I'm running twisted muscles but I don't think I had rad worms, at least not the whole time I played? My inventory still says my weapon is doing the same damage per swing but I definitely am not...
---
Maybe consider posting this info at the Fallout 76 Issue tracker so that there is a central record that can be returned to, rather than being lost from view in a couple of days on the sub.

"There's no story".
---
Followed by "I haven't done any of the main story".
---
Mm.
---
You’re at the level where you can go grab some random power armor - raider or T-45, lots of places in the forest, see Fallout 76 interactive maps online.
---
But that will give you enough of a defensive edge to let you get the sword.
---
It's 2076, suffering is in fashion again.
---
np i thought the same thing first time it happened to me after the patch lol
---
https://youtu.be/2ZIpFytCSVc
---
Damn it, i was hoping i could find a "Quad" version xD
---
Not true..you would need food/water
---
And why is your opinion somehow special? I've got a bunch of you all getting offended at me for trying to be nice. All of you saying "it's bad cause I like grinding I dont need it handed to me I want to spend weeks getting it". Okay? Just acknowledge the person and go on with your life. No need to state your opinion that they are wrong for doing so and discourage them from helping people...
---
He literally says that you SHOULD ask the devs for this type of stuff to make the game playable. What he’s saying is NOT to ask for unrealistic stuff.

Like damn bro just read the post

Someone nuked Morgantown when I was on earlier today.  I didn't run into a single Legendary when making my way through the nuke zone, but I DID stumble upon a mongrel who'd glitched out and was about 70 feet long.
---
senica rocks!

People say if u hack the robots there u can have a way easier experience. Never tried myself but it’s seems worth the shot.

Actually the minigun in FO4 is pretty shit.  Better than in FO76, but still one of the worst guns in FO4.

I guess you can say Extrra OP then, Cuz its super strong now that TSE is nerfed.

The wife &amp; i finally decided to cruise nuked whitesprings for legendaries w/ our lvl 50s chars since we've never really bothered with it before.  Then a couple high 20s players in hazmat suits started tagging along behind us.  Then finally a lvl 120's path overlapped ours &amp; we all went around tagging glowing ones &amp; gathering goodies as a ragtag band of merry murderers   
---
It was surprisingly fun.
---
Wouldn’t you just die if hunger and thirst, then just respawn back inside?
---
Yep, within a 10 mins of 5 drinking purified water i was redlining thirst.
---
No mutations, No disease.
---
While wearing power armour. which according to lore (IIRC) recycles water/urine/sweat to keep you hydrated longer.
---
&gt; I scrap it immediately
---
Sell it, or give it to a settler/provisioner.
---
Try to have at least 1 scrap of whatever you have bulked. Check if this trick works.
---
Entering the echo chamber of the it’s not worth it crowd. 
---
Weapons break unbearably too fast and it takes way too much ammo to do it in a reasonable amount of time with a reasonable amount of people. 
---
IMO If everyone of level in the server goes to the zone the problem isn’t doing damage,  it’s the server lagging out from what I can only assume is  a combination of so many people in one area and also all of those people each getting huge quantities of loot all at once. 
---
My largest problem is not being able to collect my loot after the event finishes because it either takes forever to load or it just disappears.
---
4 days on non stop forest events. Nothing. 
---
So, I think I found a work-around for the PA part de-equipping bug which might help to isolate the issue causing it. It seems to be linked to whatever not PA armor you have on in that slot.
---
Iirc (i will test it again tonight) you have to:
---
1. Get out of PA, recall, then de-equip the piece of regular armor you have in that slot (take off your left leg if it's the left leg if your PA that is the issue).
---
2.Then you summon the PA, get back in and the part should equip correctly.
---
3. Now (and this is the part I'm fuzzy about) you exit PA again, recall, then re-equip that part and re-enter.
---
At this point I believe the glitch happens again, but if you do one more exit/recall/re-summon/re-enter cycle (while keeping the non-PA piece equipped) it should fix it.
---
I did only minor testing with this so I'm sure my method isn't 100%, but it definitely has something to do with PA parts and equipped corresponding non-PA parts. Hope this helps!
---
Heavy weapon perks also don’t reduce the weight of the auto nade launcher even though it’s a monster
---
Current rates are absurd...
---
Unless being in combat, sprinting, etc increases it. But if so...tell us, please.
---
O... yea, she totally did that too, they just got her first.

What

They are valuable? I have hundreds of them. Where can I find people needing them? Lol
---
I like to give my settlers combat rifles and handmades 
---
Someone dropped a nuke by Poseidon earlier today. Two guys, a lvl 81 and another lower lvl, killed a Grafton monster and left.  Another guy, lvl 55 was powering up Poseidon. Otherwise I had the nuke zone completely to myself. 
---
I fast traveled to Whitespring Resort, then simply server hopped. Wasn't trying to complete the quest. I was farming legendaries and grinding out a couple levels before embarking on the Brotherhood questline. Just so happened that one of those server hops no one was at the resort on that server. Bunch of level 9-12 ghouls were there, only two of which were dressed as golfers, but the kills still counted towards the quest. Took maybe 10 or so hops.
---
It could. It won't, but it could.
---
I tried once, did nice damage solo.  Once the third person walked up that was pretty much it for damage.  SBQ was scaled for the mass TSE spam is all I can think of.
---
Found your problem, you’re fighting Scorchbeasts. Solution? Run away-
---
Add on an employee stating that if PC gamers dont buy the PC version then he claims the company will not bother with the audience. Enjoy the deal we made, or else.
---
Fuck em
---
Its because the Brotherhood didn't know about the power of TSE.. effin noobies. They should have looked for more legendaries. And this was way before patch and we figured it out #Vault76MasterRace
---
Until I started doing nuke zone farming it white springs around 45 I had only seen 2. Now I've seen lots of 1 star from there but never any 2. I inspect all of them.
---
Probably bad player trading
---
I'll have you know I took down a scorchedbeast with only a minigun at only lvl 69
---
Nice, I'll take two. 
---
I guess so he wanted 4 cores for 90 .45 rounds I think he thought I was desperate or a moron.
---
that is what I said lol
---
 Unique build, I like it.  I am a bit perplexed why you would put down the small purifier when you are on the water and could use the others?
---
If you've gotten to Abbie, she has a nice balance between depressing and levity.
---
Dude, he was probably new to trading. You dont have to be a dick and put up a whole post about it
---
Actually I saw a brotherhood corpse in a mine in cranberry bog that had a bat. He Must’ve specked wrong. 
---
&gt;Which in tandem negates, wait for it, 86% of armor
---
50% of 36% of 100% is not 86%. It's 68%. And that's besides the point since Sentinel+Assassin is damage reduction not tied to armor values.
---
I am level 51 and I poke at them with a .45 until they land and then I rush in and do most of the damage with the two hand melee
---
I started in a nuked whitespring yesterday with 15 full cores, played for 2 hours now I’m down to 4
---
I believe if you use radaway it does remove the mutation. 
---
he was level 53......
---
Finally I’ve been putting up with this for 2 or 3 weeks
---
I like the idea of tracking karma. Like some comments below, I don't like the idea of tying it directly to PvP stuff, but it would have a lot of other uses. 
---
I have 8 mutations. I could risk losing any of them.
---
One of the many brutal stories in this game. This, the Order of Mysteries, Colonel in Flatwoods, Abbie (though she was adorable too). There was even one kind of recently (maybe Sam Blackwell) that was moving too. A lot of dust in my room that day.
---
It's a shame that stuff like this gets lost in the mire of bugs and other issues this game has. Really think they've done better than past games with the holotape writing and voice acting.
---
Also a weird side note to this... I have had this issue with my left leg for a week or so (i haven't bothered to try to fix it as it really isn't messing me up too badly, i just re-equip each time i spawn) and yesterday I had to repair my left leg is it was almost broken, while my right leg was at about 80% durability. Now i originally repaired both of these parts to 200% at the same time, so it's weird that one would be so much more damaged than the other. The only variable here is that one was consistently involved with this de-equip glitch and the other wasn't.
---
Just something maybe worth noting.
---
Thats fairly new, getting to level 50 is easy af. And I was talking about trading, not level
---
And you can hack the turrets so they aggro the bots, and with max robotics expert you usually don't even have to worry about the bots.
---
and I am not being a dick about anything I am just saying that maybe Bethesda should look at putting in a equal trade for trade system where the value on both sides can't out weigh the other.
---
That was my Bethesda Executive Meeting Sarcasm simulator. 
---
Will add to another thread I start, this one was for PA but thanks for that!
---
I just got it at Watoga and it was simply called Revolver. 
---
Gotcha. Radaway would erase them all. I understand.  
---
50 plus 36..
---
Thanks, I'll add it
---
That is being a dick, putting up a post and calling someone a mormon for lowballing on a trade is being a dick.
---
If you spawn into a nuked world it's in stored tab.  I assume it's destroyed if your in game at the time.
---
I literally give them away to people 
---
In the 'making of' videos they said that a few different Bethesda teams came together to make the game, but once finished it would be up to Bethesda Austin to support the game going forward. Bethesda Austin are Bethesda's newest, least experienced team, so not only are Bethesda continuing to develop two other games while they support FO76, but they didn't have to lose anyone from the Starfield or Elder Scrolls teams to do it. 
---
Look at the fortnightly patches, look at the lack of QOL improvements, at the seeming inability to grasp multiplayer balance and the tin ear to the community's concerns. There's no experienced hand overseeing this fiasco, no talented coders who have prior experience with Bethesda's odd engine (and boy howdy does the FO76 support team need a few of *those*), there's no larger investment; period.   
---
Happy to help, been trying to get Bethesda's attention, but in the mean time I figured it was worth it to mention to people reporting blue screen / CTDs 
---
And then finding the tape from the guy's wife right after... 
---
Yes because it's the only game where i have problems. See others post, this occur most with Ryzen cpus.
---
Lol i made my character in the beta, now lvl 297 and i think because i started in the beta i dont have the acheivement for leaving vault 76 so....yeah vault forever 😂😂
---
I still wanna pacify the wild friendly dog up in the mountains. Don’t know why I can’t. 
---
This happened to me, only with a Handmade and Assault Rifle
---
Im at level 70+ keep getting instigating weapons, ghoul specific or medical vats ones.. So irritating
---
Mini nukes are sadly weak vs a single target. My two shoot gatling does 150 dmg if both bullets hit 300. Get a legendary gun and drop that Bat.
---
It’s also used in one of the mutation serum recipes

Power user + Batteries Included
---
Wouod you like to build something? Or are you just here for my... _soothing voice_?

Linking a damage mechanic to karma would be a horrible idea.

Just follow the fucking questline and you'll get there.

u/VauIt-Tec: IT'S FINE IF YOU DON'T BREATHE
---
The same thing happened to me with the stealth. I think it is yet another thing rad worms is affecting. In terms of game breaking, I did confirm that it only applies to your screen, other players can still see you.
---
Every time it flashes one up I go "No I'm greatly enjoying Snot Ear, thank you very much."
---
I've seen posts regarding to this as well, thought it was same for me but it was my psu dying. I replaced it and now it's working better .
---
Good you can do addition, unfortunately for you this isn't an addition problem.
---
Welcome for joining us in the LIII Super Bowl with the West Virginian vault dwellers against the Commonwealth vault dwellers. And on on the sidelines we have Preston Garvey leading the cheerleaders who are all settlers in need of help. Oh, and there is West Virginia’s mascot who appears to be glitching by clipping through the ground. I suppose this wouldn’t be a Bethesda sponsored game without some glitches ,huh Tom?
---
Git Gud.
---
Isn't the 2nd bullet like 20%?
---
i’m sitting on like 25 disease cures if u want some
---
found the Charisma dump stat
---
I just think it is weird how you can have such a unbalanced trade with no consequences 
---
Both a thank you and fantastic historical reference!  
---
  
---
Kind of decided I'm going to fight Fire with Fire, many people have said they can't do anything, because they are a large Company with set policies and standards.   
---
Figure if I literally do exactly what they've asked, and make it public...  
---
That aside, Ignoring me/us is one thing, being scolded for submitting to many bug reports is just silly. 
---
Unarmed weapons are also affected by Gladiator, just pretend it's called Iron Fist and you'll be fine.
---
Sorry you don't understand. No need to get mad over it
---
still no content for this?
---
They aren't, they used too though 
---
Hahahahaha!  I’m pro keeping a version of this bug, I’m not sure if this video is pro or con, but I love it! 
---
Could be, I think the reduction was before the bullet damage. A two shot does 20% more than a none legendary of the same gun.
---
Go to a silo entrance after a nuke is launched at a non-bravo target.  You'll here a different overseer.  
---
If it's what it takes..
---
Or just use.. wait for it.. pain train! Chu chu motherfuckers! It's an instant stagger just run into him since they cant move
---
Hey me too.  Eventually they'll buff it up again, my 4 different variety of TSE's will shine again.
---
I really like the patio bar/grill area. Nice work
---
As gmillerii said you don't get the compass pip at all. The mod isn't working no matter what weapon you use which makes this the second helmet mod I'd use to be broken alongside the Targeting HUD. Targeting HUD, aside from the crashes, seems very intermittent on when it will highlight things. I've had it highlight one Mr Handy in the Whitespring's but not the one next to it as an example of this and the highlighted one was further away.
---
I think adding NPC's shatters the atmosphere 
---
It just kills the mood and feel of the world. 
---
Or selling it...
---
Na, probably decoupling STR special from melee damage (that 5% per point ).  Easiest way to get melee inline with ranged damage.
---
" I'm Mary Poppins y'all!"
---
&gt; There's no way they didn't notice how shit these weapons were before the community started their outrage.
---
Really? Of *all* the stuff they missed, this is the one that is unbelievable? Never mind the game-breaking bugs that littered the early weeks. No, you're boggled at *this*. 
---
Not saying I disagree. I'm just not buying the feigned astonishment (unless you picked this game up this week or something). Looking at the rest of the game, there is absolutely a way that they didn't notice this. It's called laziness.
---
Dude that is amazing! I didnt even think of that
---
The author of that has been in touch, waiting for some additional information, but in the end I'm going to beat a dead horse and make sure it's in both places.  
---
Front and center here, with a new one updated each month, with a separate thread for the "class" (armor, weapons, etc) and then a main round up I hope they'll sticky in the long run.  
---
Yes, literally everyone.  Go back to /fallout and /anthem to keep spreading hate.
---
This happened to me as well but instead of a supply drop it was a random cargobot carrying a nuclear keycard, escorted by 3 vertibot. I was right next a workshop that was owned by another player and for some reason all the turrets he had placed turned hostile to me while I was shooting at the vertibots/cargobot. When I picked open the dropped container, I had that same message about the owner turning hostile yet I never got wanted.
---
I don't like it when they call them "Raider Scum" #NotAllRaiders
---
Same here. Fuck me right? Very well... Scorched Queen...
---
Hydrate.
---
I am pretty low level and that’s the only purifier I can build I think.
---
Value is relevant. Anytime I tell someone I'm not paying 5k caps for a 500 cap item they are quick to say, "Whatever dude, it's a free market". That goes both ways. You are free to *ask* for any price you think is reasonable. Another user commented and said he had 100s. I hope he isnt stashing 100s of random cores as that's a lot of weight but it proves my concept. To that player fusion cores are useless, they have more than they need. To a player that's about to fight a SBQ and dropped his last core on a lot run, he might be willing to pay 500 caps for one. The best practice is to negotiate, i.e I'll give you 90 .45 rounds for 4 fusion cores? *Nah they are worth way more than that, how about 50 rounds per core?* etc.
---
So I did over 200 pieces of wood into boards and no ban. 
---
Yup cause that's not happening in France or Venezuela right now, people aren't standing up against their governments or militaries aren't protecting the people and not a corrupt government. 
---
But if you don't think a civilian populace can't stand up against the US military then umm Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. That is all. 
---
There is a trick to completing this quest - be the only person at Whitespring.
---
If someone else is there already then chances are you'll get higher level ghouls. But I managed to kill the 8 I had remaining when I traveled to Whitespring on a desolate server. 
---
Since then I have found that if I go there and it is empty (and no-one has been there for a little while) then those pesky level 9 ghouls will make an appearance.
---
Yeah im out 
---
How can we report to BGS if context is missing?
---
dont let the door hit ya in the ... opps you dont have a door
---
Same bruh 
---
Your heads so far up your ass you are tasting your prostate cancer that reflect your mentality. The game is fine. Yes it HAD problems and still does. Never once did i deny that. You just wanna feel like its a total shit show nobody likes and your wrong. Reddit made an entire separate subreddit to prove this. 
---
I haven’t seen it.
---
Yes it happens to me occasionally and I don’t have the perk active. I do have lvl 3 in my deck. Just thought it was strange as well. 
---
So...   
---
This information makes me thing there is an issue with the "strip" process that happens when you get in PA, basically it virtually un-equips all your standard armor when you get in the PA.  
---
If it's repeatable, that means it's seeing a standard armor piece as conflicting during the login / Fast travel / enter PA process, which it shouldn't.   In theory.  
---
Good data, thanks!  
---
 
---
As for the durability, "maybe"...  
---
I've got a report in, legs seem to take the more durability hits, and my left leg seems to take about 30 - 50% more than my right leg..   
---
Wondering if it's related or some other issue entirely.
---
I give handmades to my crew in Fort Independence, who are all dressed in military uniforms and combat armor. 
---
Which issue? And glad to help if something here solved a PA issue.
---
What are you talking about? Explain 
---
I thought so but then again I have the speed demon mutation
---
They're still working out how to patch all the the exploits, the fact that there was a patch roll back doesn't help. The Modus trick was the one focused on the last patch, and they asked players to report any more known.
---
Eventually they'll figure something and it will be phased out. Then they just increase legendary tiers to four or five to make the duped gear obsolete, nerf the legendary effects duped the most, and ban the players with impossible numbers of duped aid/misc/ammo items and ban any player who was flagged for suspicious inventories. 
---
It hasn't affected the market as much as people think, if anything it's helped the userbase overall. If dupers sell you something for caps then they're feeling generous. If they dupe just to dupe then they're wasting their time when they could sell them online since they're getting banned anyway
---
Some people claim FO76 has no story.
---
Wholesome Yoda. 
---
Oh my god. 
---
After a silly amount of silo runs we've done I've never considered Robotics Expert. 
---
You absolute legend gonna try this just for a laugh :)
---
Maybe, but as soon as you end the game without leaving the vault your character is deleted
---
Thanks, will check the OMOD and details tonight, hopefully it's something more straight forward, like the Optimized Bracers.
---
be rad of it forever*
---
It's weird! I never even bought the perk cards, so it's not like it's accidentally activating from cards I purchased.
---
Uh, jetpacks can be on any build literally, and I never use power armor aka "scrub" armour. So literally zero things I wish I knew.
---
This happened to me in ash heap some one called it in and never claimed it they just went off and did whatever I guess and I claimed it as it was already opened and instant 10 cap wanted level. I just off loaded all my scrap and let some random high level claim the caps.
---
Players with more karma get a boost in magic find % for legendary drops :D
---
50+, so people aren't defenseless. Also, I don't use stimpaks, nor do I steal their junk. Just a spot of fun to pass the time ;)
---
Really it just isn't viable to be running around in a hazmat suit fighting SBQ deep in a nuke zone. Sucks to fight and beat her and get clipped by anything (esp mirelurk queens) and dropping all your loot never to see it again. You get back to the fight and SBQ is an anonymous meatpile. Why bother with a fist build here unless that's all you got? Fighting ghouls you can do with any build, they are weak.
---
I can get my damage up to ~2400 with ~80% armor piercing. Can't really one shot a SB. It needs to land anyway. Once again, why bother? I can just weapon switch to my 1star furious prime gatling gun and kill any SB without even changing any perks around with very little effort. 
---
My DR with my unyielding set is around 450/450. Still die superduper easy compared to my vanguard set with 550/550 and full health. Low health is a huge liability and it is the key to high damage melee builds. Like I said earlier, that's the trade off that makes it somewhat balanced.
---
If you are using a vampiric melee weapon, you are just doing it wrong. Running a low health melee build means you are min/maxing for dmg numbers. That means a bloodied weapon. Might as well just run a full health vanguard build with insigating/armor piercing weapons. Or run a low health power armor emergency protocol and bloodied sledge build. 
---
Just a long way to say, running around in a hazmat suit with a fist in a nuke zone is dumb. It's just ok if that's all you got I guess. There are other much better options without changing many perks or any stats.
---
I just got mine from scorch beast
---
Funny but cancer comment.
---
You can change the flashlight colors by editing the .ini files in documents. A quick Google should turn up results. 
---
I had to resort to buying a exploding shotgun from ebay for $1.. And picking the right cards.  That downed the sucker fast.. Then Bug-esda nerfed a LOT and i can still kill em just not as fast.  And using MedX helps
---
Well when people are selling 100 hunters long coats for 75 caps today I’d say duping is still very active in this game. Could be wrong but i have 200 + hrs in this game and have 1 lc I bought of a vendor. 
---
Nowhere near that serious, just a little roleplaying ;)
---
They do this for the weightless effect too. The base gun weighs 90% less but mods are full weight. 
---
Wts?
---
yeah but he didn't want to he flat out said no 4 cores for 90 .45's the problem I am running into I can't find enough lead to keep my supply high. I don't appreciate being called a dick when I tried to counter offer the guy and he flat out said no.
---
I have a question, were you playing with someone who has speed demon? I used berry mentats yesterday, it is suppose to highlight living things for me when in use, weird thing was that my teammates were glowing purple and they were able to see themselves glowing, i feel like the effects that the people around you have are also applying to you sometimes
---
This was pretty much my exact wish 
---
Maybe it has the same bug as targeting hub. Apparently that has an area of effect that if other people are in they also get the benefits. Have seen that happen a bit. So maybe serendipity has an area of effect as well and shares. 
---
What system do you play on? Asking for a friend haha
---
I work in the industry, and this is actually probably not as surprising as you might think. When I was in QA years ago, QA frequently played the game almost entirely differently than the development and design teams did. While QA can make suggestions and provide feedback... designers don't have to listen to it.
---
It would not shock me, at all, if the lead designer just had a penchant for a very particular playstyle, and chose to hone in only on that. In general, their designers seem to like stealth + long range + 1 shotting more than they like prolonged skirmishes and continued combat.
---
Development blind spots, in theory, are supposed to be corrected by collaborative design practices. However, I'd be lying if I didn't acknowledge that some people let their own ego and vision get in the way of tighter gameplay. I've seen it happen firsthand, and know it's a real thing and a real problem.
---
Good.
---
Yea I get to play a fallout game with my buddies and coworkers we always have a blast
---
I'm sorry but can you back up a moment please?  Are you saying that with the game in it's current state, Bethesda is *scolding* people for submitting bug reports?
---
As someone who is prone to paragraph long comments, this had me grinning from ear to ear. Depends on context to me. The people who write the 'I quit' posts could be drama coaches.
---
It's not bad for an excuse to be good at burning through ammo. The legendary varients are good including bloodied and TSE with a prime receiver at lvl 50. Other than that they are fun to play around with. Running all heavy perks I do 40 something without Tse. 
---
Alright thanks anyway
---
Oh really? I wasn't aware that got changed.
---
huh? Wha?
---
Click the link, screen grab of the email response from the Support Staff
---
All under their optimal conditions
---
Bloodied is 60%, Furious is 30%, Berserkers is 50%, Anti-Armor is 20%.
---
Basically use what you want now the differences are marginal or fork over the caps for bloodied and unyielding armor.
---
Sorry, at the bottom of the thread, most recent *Edit*
---
Well it is a descendant of Morrowind/Oblivion. They say "Enchant" a lot too.
---
The journal of the ex-raider in the  Big Bend tunnel describing her interactions with the BOS -- she's so surprised to be treated as a human being. 
---
Ahh OK. Took on 3 at The Whitespring Service Entrance. I was worried they would get away.
---
 Finally got some help and down the went. My Lever Action hits at 116 or something like that and that's what I use. Well until they land that is, then the Sword of Bastet kills them.
---
 I did die to Radiation once. I don't use Power Armor much and did not have Rad-X or Radaway hot keyed and the level 80 ones are really radioactive.
---
 So level 52 and no Power Armor and I looted three level 80 Scorchbeasts.
---
 How you ask? ;) BOS Heavy Combat Armor with a Dense Chest and Strengthened Limbs. They don't do shit to me. I run from the poison attacks as everyone should but her sonic attack I can ignore. The Rads when I melee them is my major problem.
---
Bethesda should rename the game to Fallout: Minecraft.
---
Right, the comment above about power calls, good to know. Likely having higher AGI would be good I think the action point pool is used for thrusting. (please correct me anyone.)
---
I am with you, I am on combat armor currently most of the time.
---
Cult of the Mothman love it. I know someone who’s gonna buy the Mothman power armor skin. 
---
yeah, that's what I did the third time. At level 141, I have all the necessary perk cards now.
---
Yeah no, F dupers in the A.
---
Really? Most of the enemies don't even spawn in from far away unless another player is already there and unless their using an explosive weapon without you having any explosive resisting mods/perks than there are very few enemies that have strong ranged attacks.
---
Luck of the draw I guess.
---
I actually bought two of my explosive guns at train station vendors.  Strangely they were remote ones nowhere near White Springs.
---
For lead, finish the quest for the Excavator PA and register it. Doing so gives you more ores when you collect from veins, when you have both arms equipped. Head to lucky hole mine, near Fort Definace, throw on Excavator arms, mine all the lead deposits. Takes 15 or so minutes and you'll walk out with enough ore to make 500+ lead. All you'll need is acid to smelt it. Acid can be gotten from several public workshops, and is pretty easy to get from looting.
---
What about undamaged vehicles, driving vehicles would make the map much more manageable than walking/fast traveling everywhere 
---
It isn't just that they "make up for it" -- the lack of living people is a major point.
---
Negative. Solo player, no diseases, no mutations. Just level 30 so I don’t have a *ton* of perks. I only asked here because it is definitely different than how it was last week, and I haven’t changed anything. 
---
Thanks!  
---
Figure I'll fight fire with fire..  
---
Going to be hard to ignore when we have a detailed, formatted and "ticketed" thread for each type of issue.
---
Same I only use PA for nukes because currently you basically have to unless you have a very specific build which I do not have anywhere near. PA feels clunky, glitchy &amp; the UI is so big &amp; ugly. I’ll keep my purple Megaton bun held high in the sky 
---
Oof. Also, yeah :(
---
40 at that fire rate would be pretty ok but that seems pretty unattainable with my rifles skill tree I've put together... I do have really high strength too though idk
---
There's still one that has been actively known and reported countless times since the beta. Threads naming it it get deleted but I've still seen no mention of it being fixed
---
Well, let's also be fair here.  Your power armor weighs 10lbs.  :D  You also can't realistically expect a bunch of nerdy northern game devs to know what real guns weigh.  LOL
---
Thanks, will put on the UI thread once I get it complied 
---
Ya this existed in fallout 4 as well, it was 80% for selling and 120% for buying corresponding to the base price, im sure they carried that over but with different percentages
---
Kinda looks like a solid fix to me.
---
YEA...break the lore even more by having multiple control vaults in the same area ;) our only hope is that they were experiments that didn't get to start 
---
Hahaha your post is because someone is sell multiple apparel for cheap. What if they acquired them in numerous trades with the intent to sell. You are whats dragging this game. People like you throwing around while accusations with zero proof. All because someone has something you dont. And its making everyone paranoid to trade and interact from the fear of getting reported and banned. You’re a joke kid
---
I have 800 acid I just need the lead.
---
No response to someone else
---
If you equip a starch genes lvl 1 perk card and use a rad shower it remove one random mutation best way without removing them all.
---
He’s playing like shit rn. Rams r playin shittier tho
---
noob question but is Bandolier worth taking?
---
I’m not trying to risk losing different ones that I’m happy to have, that’s exactly my suggestion
---
And whats that?
---
Wouldn’t it look so much more badass with this paint ... it’s a shame tbh
---
If only the sort by (spoil) worked properly
---
Funny how they'd rather inconvenience the player rather than add a few lines of code to check for collisions at the C.A.M.P. spot and place the player accordingly.
---
I'm surviving Preston Garvey
---
yeah, that would make sense, if you're not killing them they're not generating new waves. Don't think I've even unlocked the perk cards for that though, unfortunately.
---
Oof sorry lol, though it was all bugs missed the PA specific 
---
hmm, the review seems to be a youtube link.
---
Tried this plenty. Automatic weapons still kill you if they can get vats off. Thats why i always carry stealth boys.
---
Just go and hide in the toilet.  It works.
---
Or, if you have power armor, one long range weapon, a shotgun or melee weapon and some space for the SoB to land -- man up and kill the fucker.  
---
Exactly.  I'm tired of them. 
---
I've always disliked Karma.  It was a low resolution, lazy way to handle moral choices in a stupidly gamable way.
---
Steal something and nobody sees you?  Bad Karma.  Give a thirst guy some water?  All better!
---
I mean, that IS the definition of Karma, but the way NPCs would supernaturally know your karma was annoying and game breaking.
---
With that said, your suggestion is a brilliant implementation, with some caveats.
---
It rewards "good" players and punishes evil players.  I know this seems great, but it punishes a not insignificant portion of the player base for daring to enjoy the game the way they want.
---
I would suggest that both ends of karma have good and bad sides.  Good karma reduces slap damage, but also reduces xp rewards for killing baddies (because killing is, like, bad, man).  Bad Karma makes  you take full damage, but gives you more caps on a wanted kill and gives you better XP rewards.  "Good" karma is for carebears like me, "Bad" karma is for PvPers and trolls, and middling karma is for people who like to dabble.
---
I don't think stats based display is useful though... What benefit do you get for tight resolution on Karma scores?  What behavior would change if you knew my karma was in the 60s, or 64?
---
Everyone should see karma as an icon like the old Karma statuses, Jesus vs Devil, and the 20 point chunks in-between.  And Jesuses and Devil's should broadcast on the map as pins, to collect like minded players.  If a Jesus wants to trade, I'll trust him.  If a Devil is skulking around Whitesprings I'll go do something else.
---
Karma could be completely unrelated to faction.  A devil responder is a valid game style, as is a Jesus enclave officer.  It's how you play it that counts.
---
I use it, I'm level 122. But I also play tank builds and carry multiple guns (10mm sub and pistol, 2 shotguns, lever action, handmade, sniper, and melee)
---
Haven't touched the game in over a month. There's nothing to do at lvl 250. Me needs a content injection.
---
That the great thing about America we all get to have are own opinions and I respect yours as you should others so have a blessed day KID. 
---
except plenty on the regular fallout reddit claim still duping. are they lying. idk, prove they aren't duping.
---
Guns breaking as well.
---
Missed opportunities 
---
Would be interesting if I started talking to myself like Gollum from Lord of the rings though answering my own reddit posts :)
---
This was an issue even before the patch, at least for me it was.
---
I did not say that. For what it's worth, I've gotten up to the point of completing quests for Rose. None of the questing up to this point, in my opinion, has provided a compelling story.
---
Of course that is only my opinion, and every individual is entitled to their own.
---
I am aware of the main quest and how it plays out.
---
yeah, Assaultrons were def the worst, but Gutsys were a pain in the balls too, and even the lower level ones like the yellow protectrons seemed really spongey. I think half the problem is I get turned around in there constantly, they made navigating it about as un-intuitive as possible, so not really confident in the speed option yet. Hacking turrets and robots with terminal helped some, but Christ, they still throw so much crap at you. 
---
No person wants to waste the ammo or materials needed to fix armor and weapons 
---
love my tse laser rifle... no  biggy if i have to go.to a weapons workbench every 3 minutes..and constantly farm the materials needed
---
&gt; this is just excessive.
---
'cos civilization destroying nuclear war is supposed to be *fun*.
---
Oh yeah one more thing. If you know anyone that would like to sell me a hundred long coats for say 30 caps a piece so I can sell them all for 75 I’ll by them all. A month ago they were selling upwards of 10k caps.
---
Guilty til proven innocent. Hahaha ok. People post whatever they want. Just like this guy. Can claim theres duping going on with zero evidence because someone had 100 long coats. If it was duped who even knows when it was duped
---
yeah, those are highly aggravating. Had the same issue with the Watoga Mayor quest. Only way I was able to finish it was by hiding out in the lower floors while a scorchbeast softened up all the Gutsys on the rooftop. They are way overpowered. I can handle 1-2 at a time but not 6-8!
---
WOW. Totally....
---
Could you be anymore insufferable?
---
[deleted]
---
All I asked for was more stash space!
---
I got a lead pipe from her a week ago. Not worth the effort or resources. 
---
when u say unarmed you mean all you do is use your fists? no weapons.? 
---
no,not guilty till, they are proclaiming themselves dupers openly.
---
Don't apologize, and if you find another you think is important drop it on here, just wanted to let you know why you wouldn't see it on **this** thread!   
---
I know it's weird, this being Reddit and all, but I wasn't griefing you ;)
---
No thank you, I trust in bethesda's "No human NPCs". Plus it's already confirmed to be Dungeons as provided by datamines
---
What about the single players that don't interact much with other people?
---
Launched my first nuke yesterday at lvl 75, and I was solo.  Took me an hour to do it but I didn't know what I was doing, I think I could do it again in 30 minutes.  Only thing that gave me any trouble was the higher level assaultron.  FYI, I'm a melee build, I would say I used a couple stimpacks but not many.  
---
Sometimes it shows the animation when it procs for someone in the area.
---
Adapt and overcome..... Looks great!
---
You got downvoted, but that's just solid game design principle - if you build in a system where there's a sliding scale like karma, make sure there are benefits to staying on one end or the other and for maintaining a balance.
---
Ok but if you trade this better gun you dont use  for a different slightly worse gun you would use you might want a little something extra to even out the trade maybe to make caps off. Perhaps a hunters longcoat you know you could sell. Its not rocket science kid
---
I'd had the same experience as you until I lost my Instigating Gauss Rifle today. You never know when it's gonna happen but the reaper comes for us all eventually.
---
I killed 2 legendaries while in the same zone as an Enclave event. No commendations. But this is the first and only time I haven't been awarded them correctly. Maybe it is an Enclave event zone bug.
---
I have not seen 1 person say i am a duper i dont care if they ban me from a game i paid real life money for
---
Fallout 76 has backstory.
---
It's nice, but the player's journey is severely lacking. 
---
All the cool shit happened before we even stepped foot out of the vault. 
---
--close 
---
You cant fix garbage 
---
This is separate and easily reproducable bug for me. I have found it rather ridiculous that it will even stack with the bug you are mentioning to end up with 320/820 weight and still be in an  "overencumbered" state. I should be around 460/485 without all of these bugs. 
---
Looks like ghoulish or rad sponge can do this too
---
For the same exact item 100 times yeah ok 👍 
---
There's no slap damage on the PVP servers, so the idea for changes to PVP based on karma are moot.
---
They are not.
---
I honestly think bethesda just needs to implement a force change on the explosive roll across the board old and new change it to burning damage makes sense and dosent hurt the weapons imo I would love that gives laser weapons something new unique and effective. But I feel ya on the hoarding my tse tesla wants so bad to be used 😆
---
i used up over 2k 5.56 ammo and me and about 8 others took 25 minutes to kill her.....yay..i got another explosive vent..can never have too many of those...another time just yesterday i heard the nuke siren..went to my camp to get ready for the sbq battle..took me about 69seconds to get ready..go to look at the map to fast travel there and the event was over..cant believe someone kill led it in less than 60 seconds
---
Get a PC
---
all my plants were destroyed
---
unarmed is punching attacks, you could use fists, deathclaw gauntlet, knuckles, power fist, meat hook, boxing glove 
---
I have marsupial and a jetpack. The game is limitless for me now. I scale any mountain. (Its how I found my camp location actually. Just climbing mountains. 
---
Because BGS doesn't understand multiplayer game design.
---
So I know this thread is old but I would like to clear something up. Fallout 76 has an anticheat, BUT it’s zenimax’s anticheat which is infamous for being horrible.
---
I may be wrong but:
---
The anticheat has no heuristics detection, it has no machine learning, hell I don’t think it even checks if files are being modified.
---
All it does is scan the memory for a list of blocked programs, and even this can be circumvented by simply renaming the process from something like cheatengine to “totallynothacks”
---
It has a HUMAN MADE list of programs and that’s all it has, this is why it sucks, it can’t catch up to any cheaters until it’s list has been updated. It’s bad and yes it can’t use heuristics or machine learning to catch exploiters or unknown hackers. It’s a bad anticheat.
---
Why is OP salty? Sounds like the least salty post I've seen today!
---
Also: I'm 400 hours in and haven't been to every location yet. Still several I've not looted. It's not been my priority 
---
It's only for the ones listed.
---
Not necessarily missed. Anyone here good with sfm?
---
 Some people play to the style they like and not the min-max OP.
---
Same exact thing happened to me today. Shot down a cargobot next to a random's camp and his turrets started firing on me. Not sure if I got that message though, if I did I didn't notice it.
---
Agreed. Seems as though it sorts by "can it spoil" rather than "which will spoil first". Not ideal but still saves time sorting spoils vs. non-spoil
---
i can handle all the robots fine, the assaultrons and gutsies with the machine guns were a pain, i got used to the silo layout rather quickly. i agree though that the amount of enemies does get crazy at times 
---
I am just speaking about energy weapons of course not ballistic.
---
Its not a rare item anymore. Could have more and maybe thats all the space for caps they have and need them quick. You dont know. Youre making assumptions and throwing out accusations with no proof
---
Agreed, the amount of times my camp comes up as already taken really is starting to bother me, it really can’t be that impossible to query the world for availability before entirely loading us into the world
---
That technical data we put in the secure data storage is the plans for crafting gears springs and screws.
---
Not sure why you need to be hostile about it. 
---
Or in that cliff!
---
How exactly did you *lose* it?? 
---
It’s massive server lag and has been worse since the patch. I don’t know what they did, but the spinning wheel of death on paper bags and meat piles is getting very old. 
---
No paints for Excavator sadly. 
---
Not a bad Ashe cosplay tbh
---
Wow that's crazy man. Thanks for sharing!
---
This not the whole story either. Super mutants took his dog. He went out to get it back and fully expected to die in the process.
---
Seems he succeeded though.. until raiders caught them. That's what's your story picks up.
---
I mass sell the marine tactical helmet. I found the plan and it sells for 30 caps a helmet. I have like 70 in my inventory waiting to sell. That's how I make my money.
---
Happy cake day
---
ok
---
Getting downvoted for your highly accurate representation of AAA developers... smdh. Here have my upvote.
---
The lasers are especially awful. 2-3 reloads and broke.  It's moronic to invest resources in it. 
---
Just run from them unless you have to kill them, they're not worth the ammo.
---
I use shotguns + enforcer to cripple wings and make them land then just shot them in the face at close range. 
---
Prime receivers work well, but you get the plans from killing scorchbeasts so you'd have to get or buy the plans first. 
---
I was thinking bird bones and marsupial
---
Out of interest, why are you still here if you quit the game?
---
I not saying you shouldn't be... I'm just wonderig why you would stick around after.
---
You're getting downvoted for being a cheater. Don't pay to win. 
---
Barely. But she does go on about how she’s already dead. Plus the lack of humor
---
I like ideas 2 and 3, but i dont think they should be changing slap damage in PvE servers like that. If karma should do anything to players it should purely be cosmetic. I can only see issues for PvP players with idea 1. Mainly being a high karma player deciding one day to kill a low karma player and one hitting him with zero retaliation. One hits are already an issue and i just feel like it would add more. The PvP players will be flocking to the PvP servers, so i don't imagine PvE players have to worry about them much longer regardless. 
---
But what would they do with their lives instead?  You can’t expect people to treat a video game as a video game.
---
OMG WTF BBQ MY UBER TSR CANT ONE SHOT SBQ!  HOW DARE YOU BGS FOCUS ON ME PERSONALLY!
---
I have had more server lag/infinite load screens/disconnects after this patch and the hotfix than ever on XB1. Don’t know what they did, but it’s getting bad. 
---
The anti armor perks work in addition, they don't apply one a time multiplicatively.
---
I thought that happened when someone took your loot. Perhaps I'm mistaken. 
---
when I was level 50 (just 64 now), some level 160 player dropped me a double barrel explosive after we had teamed up for a bit.  My favorite thing in the game...so fun.
---
Enjoy it!
---
I'm curious how human NPCs would change anything.  You'd interact with them, get whatever quest they do/listen to their dialogue, then you'd be done with them.  The problem with the game right now isn't lack of human NPCs, it is lack of content end game.
---
Thats the problem tho. They souldnt release a game if its not ready. 
---
Crits negeate the assassin's sentinel effect too. Just don't tell anyone I told you &gt;.&gt;
---
The negative strength from bird bones is too much to have it alongside marsupial just cancels out the weight buff of marsupial.
---
I actually have speed demon and marsupial. I think that is better than bird bones. Also trying to get herbivore because I have a little farm and dont use meat often. 
---
Electrical charge, plague Walker, and unstable isotopes are the others I want for my character. 
---
The point of having karma in a PvP environment is to have a way to try and feel out if the situation to see if someone's just gonna start shooting.
---
There is soooo much to learn but it comes naturally as you play it. You will make mistakes and changes but you will learn from them. I’m level 50 and still have no clue what I’m doing. When I first played I spent a week making different camps... now my thing is farming power cores and crafting ammo. 
---
I guess play at your own pace and enjoy the ride. 
---
I wouldnt say their expansions tho. Its more like time gated content that gets patched in.
---
I witnessed two players outside Whitespring PVP-ing with a board and rolling pin. It was hysterical. 
---
Yeah, looks like the Minutemen are shutting down team Fallout pretty well.
---
If your camp is in a blast zone, it gets razed to the foundations. You can repair it, but you should probably move your camp when you get the notification and it's in the red circle or server hop if you want no part of the nuke anyway. 
---
If your camp is on the Whitesprings grounds it will get nuked every single day. 
---
Change to a full auto commando build.
---
Or a semi auto build without sneak.
---
Without the stealth perks you can still have some fun.
---
But yeah, it’s fucking stupid and insulting how find new ways to make the game worse
---
Someone make a "Living with..." mod quick.
---
Insane 
---
When I share it, two seconds after I close pipboy it falls off
---
Don't forget the Ultracite Explosive Vents too.
---
A simple start would be for Bethesda to start looking at every account that has the super rare 5 matching pieces of sentinel/cavalier armor. Then start peeling the onion one layer at a time.
---
Cool.  
---
I’ll be the guy running through there with a spiked Tamborine wearing a dress.
---
How is that for your immersion?
---
man at least quote it right
---
To be fair(ish) it was like this in Fallout 4 too. They just carried over the boring/OP nature of melee to F76. Because of pvp, now we care.
---
FONV got the balance almost right, still leaned towards rifled builds but not bad enough that you didn't have choices. So miss that game.
---
If only I could get a longbow. XD
---
I found 5 3☆ furious handmades in shop...
---
It's not really unbalanced as you can't sell cores to the vendors, the seach core has a relative value of 0 caps. 
---
Sell raw flux, you're level 90 with power armor! 
---
If you need fusion cores, take over one of the power plant workshops. 
---
sounds good, 
---
Maybe that's the solution to all the pvp complaints. You're restricted to no armor and can only choose between a board or rolling pin as your weapon!
---
I'm 100% sure you are right. I got that impression immediately as soon as he started talking.
---
I can build you a shower if you have the materials.  I'll be on in 20 minutes or so.
---
try clicking on it, darling.
---
Yeah. Not much left to nerf there. 
---
I dont get why they decided to remove karma from Fallout in the first place. A karma/honor system makes rpgs way more fun and adds a lot of replayability. 
---
Exactly! Were gifs easy to post I'd put up that "smart thinking" guy
---
Trending topics popup on my app and I read a few posts while I'm here. Don't hate the game. Just annoyed and burnt out. Sorry if I offended you.
---
I'm enjoying it. I used to mod FO4 to make it harder. More enemies, more of them, better guns and armour... I wanted it to be nasty.
---
Try unequipping it, reloading the game and re equipping it. Sometimes fixes perks that are not working properly
---
Thats cool too! I only ever use vats when people are halo jumping around lol. Im definitely gonna try that next time
---
I don't have a screenshot handy, but [here it is on the Fandom page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tattered_mole_outfit)
---
I have, I swap that perk out many time when I fight SBQ. No dice
---
That happened to me but with a skull mask. I have been saving some for friends but the one that glitched wasn't grouped witht he others. It didn't actually glitch until I put on a gas mask, but when I took it off my head was still gone. It wasn't until I went to change appearance to get my head back and it showed the mask as opposed to my head. It wouldn't let me take it off so I dropped it, even then I had to equip and unequip another mask before my head came back. 
---
Food processor was hungry for some scrambled combat armor
---
Great idea. 
---
How does that person have the camp budget to pull it off?
---
You don't care about the main story? Ok fair enough. I did and was really hoping she was alive and well. I found a dead woman im a vault suit at one point and really hoped it wasn't her (it wasn't). One of the hollotapes really worried me in particular.
---
But not caring *does not equal* no story.
---
My first reaction is - Mama Dolce's?
---
Well shit, I still had hope they were interested in fixing this game.  Fuck me for giving them my money, I guess. It won't happen again.  I appreciate your efforts though, even if Bethesda doesn't!
---
Why?
---
What does rad worms do that this requires you to have it for it to work 
---
The de equipping power armor pieces i happens every time I resplendent and was in armor or when I get out and back in
---
Have you tried uninstalling?

You'll never need lead again. Put your camp on a lead mineral deposit.. Boom. My choice spot was the one of 3 in the middle between Top of the World and Whitespring. 
---
You'll need steel now. Grafton steel yard. You'll have a ton of lead and wind up w no steel, trust me. I went 100 levels as a gun user. Lever action so .45 as well.
---
When you run out of acid, I picked that flower spot on the map. You'll get plenty of purified water too w the pond. And you can make a farm for adhesive.
---
Bam!
---
Suddenly off the charts?  You mean the sudden 20+ year life she had?
---
no i have the plan but no materials
---
Go into third person while in power armor. Walk up to the door and look straight up. Hold down the exit armor key while turning your camera to the side and mash the enter armor key during the exiting armor animation. You’ll clip inside the domes and find the rest are all empty.
---
Nope, not offended. You didn't say anything offensive! I was trying to ask without sounding grumpy but that's hard to do in text. Thanks for answering.
---
I hope we'll get some new content soon and you'll maybe come back.
---
 I already wasted 20 seconds on that earlier.
---
I hate that food processor machine with every fiber of my being. I'd always do either Feed the People if I was in Morgantown or Fertile Soil if I'm around Flatwoods because it doesn't take long and there's a 50% chance of getting an ok leveled 1* legendary. Now if Feed the People shows up I intentionally remove the quest marker in my pip-boy and pretend I never even seen it.
---
There is no right way to play fallout, just play as you like. You dont have to build a camp but it helps with crafting and scrapping. Other players can destroy it, but its pretty rare. 
---
If you are new to fallout, i would recommend to follow a build guide, just choose some build thag you think is neat. Later when you learn the game you can make own builds.
---
Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?
---
No thanks, have a nice day

It does and has been known for a while that it's multiplicative.
---
It’s called Xanax 
---
If you make major mistakes on your build you can just level up more to change them. Don't worry so much, just play and have fun. I'm 113 and thinking of where I want to take my build later.
---
Well fucking lucky you
---
I found a Cappy outfit and a Bottle and Cappy outfit at a vendor yesterday. Snapped that up Because I haven't seen them before.
---
Anybody know if they are rare?
---
Well, nuts. Thanks.
---
Should rename it to the "Jefferson Whore House" lmao. Anybody from Charleston/Kanawha Co. knows. 
---
Yeah, that stinks. Thanks.
---
Disappointing. Thank you.
---
It’s one room with steelheart and has 7-15 screws in it.  For time, I haven’t found anything faster.
---
Ahh no idea then. Most likely a bug then. Sorry dude 
---
Every explosive weapon ive come across (about 5 in total, farming watoga) I've traded them all away. I hatr explosive weapons, such garbage. I'll stick with my two shot, 10% damage while aiming, 250 damage resist while reloading 50. Cal lmg.
---
Find an older player and stand on their lawn. 
---
Lmao
---
Holy Crap, I was thinking the same thing!!,
---
Read your own link.
---
Armor penetration on weapon mods is multiplicative AFTER, the effect from perks and legendaries.
---
Jeezus Christ man, at least read shit before you try to use it as backup to a point you make.
---
TL;DR the post you share literally provides evidence against your point.
---
How long does it last?
---
BeThEsDa BaD
---
&gt; Threads naming it get deleted
---
You can just look it up yourself though, took me about 8 minutes of digging to find it
---
work with gaus+tesla rifle.
---
You dont like looking like a tonka truck? Haha I've been using the prototype X01 and its yellow also.
---
 I seriously dislike level scaling. It makes it much harder for me to get a challenge.
---
I just found a cap stash while in the bunker to launch a nuke.  1 cap.  EPIC loot still works.
---
Everyone's against you man, everyone but you is lying 😅😅😅😅
---
Loser.
---
Elaborate  please. Are they being deleted when you move or what.
---
I didn't say I don't care about it, either. It was revealed that there were no living human NPC's during press conferences multiple times. That's a point I had made in my original post.
---
If the story wasn't spoiled from day zero, the main story would have been more compelling.
---
Hopefully the most OP gear in the game is in there and people who've been farming the Whitespring 24 hours a day can't get it because they never explored and found the flatwoods monster.
---
!remindme 12 hours

Dem be fightn words, youngen!!!

So what I have done is rigged up a switch to a powered speaker and then invite people to my camp and act like nothing is wrong.

The newest patch introduced a bug where having radworms increases the positive effects of your mutations.  When you are cured of the disease, it decreases the positive effects significantly until you relog.

So you reinstalled?
---
Righteous build and very funny. You might want to add an evil kitchen to cook evil vittles. Even evil needs a.snack...
---
Reminds me of Dark Souls.
---
Get a quad automatic tesla gun and turn on pacifist. Unload a few hundred fusion cells into them. The slap sound should be beyond obnoxious
---
Why does the funny stuff get downvoted man wth 😂 
---
Dunno if this contradicts your X-01 red headlamp report but I was able to buy the mod on Friday after the hot fix. I still have it in mod form as I’m hoping it’s rare and valuable now. 
---
Ok then I'll rephrase.
---
Not compelling story *does not equal* no story.
---
There is an extremely powerful item in there and that’s all I’ll say on that. 
---
Clearly you're the one not reading it since that would mean anti-armor+incisor gives 125% armor reduction which it literally spells out in the calculation tables is not true because they're doing multiplicative calculations.
---
Thanks, and don't know / can't comment.
---
There's humour all over this game, from the Vendor Bots to tableaus, to computer entries, etc.  The various BoS notes and computers are full of it, too.  
---
It's not nearly all depressing.  But much of it is, and I love it.
---
Same here. Don't farm Whitesprings, only entered a nuke zone once, and was immediately chased out by a much higher level glowing one (was level 25ish at the time), still haven't been to probably about a third of the map. I came up with my own little way to play the game, and I've been enjoying the game immensely.
---
The bugs suck, indeed, and the lack of an endgame is quite evident.  But, honestly, that isn't a big deal to me.  The role i assume in the game doesn't involve fighting SBQ, or having the most powerful weapons, so I'm good. It's about helping others in-game and being a decent wasteland resident for me. 
---
The game is what you make of it, in my opinion. I can see why people hate it. I can see why people enjoy it. The bugs and nerfs do suck hardcore at times. It's definitely not a game for everyone, but it is for me.
---
Oh is that happening? Hmm that's weird.
---
So I've been running all the science's while using my quad explosive ultracite laser rifle. It might be increasing its durability.....maybe....100 rounds in the chamber. Gun but and luck of the draw. So I don't know. Ran out of 600 fusion cells and at 25%
---
This was an issue before the Rad Worms """fix""" was put into place, but it seems to be a lot more common now thanks to it.
---
For reference, [it happened to me back in November](https://twitter.com/HopperHorn/status/1068366071541960706) of last year.
---
not keen
---
&gt;Literally everyone in this game
---
Literally everyone in this sub uses hyperbole.
---
WOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWO!!!!  
---
Flaming unicorns is a reasonable request.
---
Real MVP here responding to my 70 day old post.
---
I'd be down for that as well.
---
I knew I traded that sentinel armor set for this breath under water set for a reason.
---
That's not bad.
---
Exactly which kinda proves the point that "it's supposed to have a sad and depressing atmosphere so anything at all like people surviving and other happy stuff can't be allowed" is bullshit.
---
The camps are frustrating if you want to actually build something. But then again its challenging to make things work perfect when building so I enjoy that. 
---
One thing that may calm you down a little is once you hit level 50 you have the option to slowly respec your character.(you can move one point per level or pick a different perk card instead) So once you see all the cards you can decide how you want to survive the wasteland. Dont worry about putting the point in the wonrg place.
---
Any tips for finding all 8 pieces of a silo code, I  stumble on the occasionally, and I have a bunch, but not 8 for a single silo, and I have 9 code pieces
---
Lack of stash storage didn't die it was murdered!
---
Yep it's chainsaw. I spent a lot of the game playing a crazy asylum nurse. Had a dual bar flaming chainsaw and I would sneak up on players at vendors before pulling it out and making loads of noise with it. Would never attack them though, just make them jump. Scrapped it by accident a few days ago lol
---
Right now my fave is a two shot single action pistol. It's only level 10 (and I'm level 170 or something) but it's just a fun pistol. I don't like OP weapons as they make the game boring and no challenge. I'm glad they balanced out some of the TSE damage so I can use them again now.
---
Unironically making a trolling funny moments video in 2019...ouch
---
Where did you get that first bit? Haven't seen that yet
---
He posted it here himself a few days ago
---
Yeah.  Got bored.  It still sucks.  
---
blueprints don't even work anymore, the budget is too small.
---
Interrrrrrresting....how many do you typically carry/use up per encounter? I have one on me just for dicking around but I never thought to deploy them against players.
---
deserves as much attention as possible imo :P
---
Im not sure what you mean.  I havent been there yet
---
Haha, I mean, it could be experimental vaults that had survivors. Similar to how in Fallout 1, you leave Vault 13 to meet a survivor from Vault 15 at Shady Sands.
---
Hmm... 
---
Rad worms
---
I had 600ish bullets when I logged out.  When I logged in I had 0
---
I play whenever I find time.  Level 80, 150+ hours in.  Just moved camp to a green at the Whitespring.  
---
Livin' the life.
---
They lived in a watch tower somewhere. He left a note there thinking he would die to the super mutants.
---
Poor guy and poor dog. This game has a really dark feel to a lot of the things you find.
---
" **Can you guys stop asking Bethesda to implement crazy things** "' true. they need finish their base game first.
---
Because Austin 316 isn’t coming back :(
---
I did not say you were wrong. 
---
It was working fine for me after the update and then I ranked it up to level 2 and it hasn’t proc’d once since then... I seem to recall someone saying L2 was broken
---
I understand everyone is going to REEEE about the weapons nerf, but that's not really the problem with the encounter.  The lack of good rewards is, and the fact that she can scale up so much with more players.  If they cap that at something reasonable and make sure everyone gets a few 3 star legendaries (on the right weapons, not things like rolling pins), then it would prob be popular again.
---
Can we please just put the damage cards into one? Dedicating 60% of your best stat just for damage is so boring.
---
I was excited about the card system after 4s system, which sucked, but it's so boring having a minimum of 9 special points devoted just to doing damage. 
---
Did you do much damage to the queen? I think that loot may not drop if you do not do some min percentage, but idk.  
---
I go in with a bloodied gatling gun and can see her health reduce with each hit and I almost always find loot. Then I wait for a while and wonder why no one else is taking it.
---
Well if they could do it like Anthem it would work pretty good. 
---
Probably a UI glitch, exit completely out of the game and restart and they might reappear. 
---
I assume that's when the bombs fell.
---
Idk Anthem was pretty challenging to be honest
---
Nope, but if you find a plan it will tell you if it is known or not. Same with recipes. 
---
I'm still chuckling over getting whacked about the head and neck with a protest sign...
---
To be fair, I got 114 from the one above the Enclave Bunker service entrance. 
---
Pain train is one of my favorite perks and you really just need 1 rank of it. The only downside is you need to be careful in whitesprings, you'll agro the robots 
---
Was it at Harper's Ferry?
---
I know exactly what you mean.  Some of it is downright haunting, but I'm loving it so much anyway
---
They were all Atomic clocks?
---
Why wouldn’t they just fast travel or swap servers?
---
It tells you when you look at them. "KNOWN"
---
"Excuse me I got a man's ass to whip!!!"
---
LOL. I've actually started to find it annoying,"how dare you assume.. I dont even notice."
---
Darn it, that was actually the one I was thinking of!  I should have gone with that.
---
I have a simple question. Are these prices for the bolt on mods from the mods tab or are they prices for plans? They appear to be plan prices. Why would anybody pay thousands for the plans when they can buy the bolt on mods for a couple hundred? How often are you really going to craft those mods to make it worthwhile?
---
you lost me a"wah" how about not insulting people in the first 6 words.
---
Of course.
---
Some of the big issues on here are just lies.
---
Sounds like it might be because i just noticed about half the food I craft grants 0 xp.
---
If we're going off of Serum Recipes as a base, which I believe is 10k, the rate for Fallout 76 is 175%.  Yeesh.
---
\[PS4\] here.  Played every day this weekend, no issues.  Sorry about yours.
---
Fuck that’s hot. 
---
Go chase your glowy thing and leave the super bowl alone!
---
(note meant to mock the double standards of a political comedian, not you)
---
Or we could just play Anthem.
---
massive f. I lost a two shot combat rifle (level 30) to that machine and haven’t touched it since.
---
I'm one of those who put into that particular stash, as my camp is right next to it. That idea would certainly benefit me.....
---
My idea: Certain factions have a natural alignment (responders and the fire eaters or whatever they're called, and the raiders and the free states, for instance). As a responder, i can get good karma for positively interacting with a fire eater, or for actions against the raiders or free states. Get bad karma for actions against other responders or fire eaters (or whatever faction would be aligned with yours).
---
Good karma rewards could be better prices at aligned vendors, some caps or stuff.... Bad karma can result in opposite results or wanted status, or something if that nature.
---
Just my thoughts.
---
&gt;Good karma reduces slap damage, but also reduces xp rewards for killing baddies (because killing is, like, bad, man). Bad Karma makes you take full damage, but gives you more caps on a wanted kill and gives you better XP rewards.
---
Great idea! It seems like a lot of people have suggested that this implementation of karma only benefits "good" players. This is a great way to give benefits to "evil" players.
---
These are for the Plans themselves. The exotic mods never appear as just mods. If you find calibrated shock mods for the Excavator I’ll buy them right now. Some of the simple mods are available but the plans to make them are available for purchase.
---
The higher the level the more budget you have to work with.  Also no turrets.
---
No. I actually like that theres a ton of complaints here. More of a chance Bethesda will do something about it.
---
Yeah... that happens.
---
A couple of weeks ago I took over a workshop and a few minutes afterwards there were vertibots flying over it with a cargo bot. I shot down one of the vertibots and my turrets starting shooting at me. I stored them and pulled them back out and they were fine. Weird.
---
Yeah, to me FO76 is almost like Roblox to my kids. I mean I watch my kids play that game doing multiple things. Building, grinding for resources, PvP, build their own worlds etc. Hell, sometimes the screams I hear from the computer room when they play a PvP game called "Granny" something in Roblox I can tell they are fully immersed in a game world that I find silly looking and buggy but they enjoy it.
---
I do similar things in FO76 and it is also buggy to be honest but I enjoy it. To me if I had to choose between no FO76 or a buggy FO76 I choose buggy. 
---
That might not be a bad idea. I just have a problem...
---
True
---
So it just fires all of your ammo? I’m level 98, the head was lv 45 and it didn’t even kill the super mutant
---
No, it wasn't.
---
When I log in sometimes shit is gone. Or when my camp cant be placed and i replace it is when it happens the most
---
i’m sure you’re the life of every party
---
Yeah, it fires it all off. 
---
You can craft it, it's a barrel mod.
---
!RemindMe 16 hours
---
Alright number crunching time. What was your bae charisma no perks? What chems/drinks/food did you use? And what perk cards?

Without any damage increase? That’s ridiculous

Bug: Railway rifles aren’t receiving buffs from the rifleman set of perks
---
Submitted a ticket but no word yet.
---
Will I find Raxxla in the facility?
---
I can not. I can do a few barrels but none are the Karma barrel.
---
My first was Hunters Dragon.  Prior to nerf it was pushing close to 700dmg.  Now it’s like 270 which is still very respectable but nothing like before the patch.  My “go to” is very similar to yours.  Goes about 200dmg.  I went with more distance and it’s a fun weapon.  My favorite is a Gauss with the ultracite cartridges.  Pushes around 200dmg.  Did a fair amount of farming today and actually got a few decent drops including a Zealot Fat Man. 
---
The only thing to be aware of is your build near the end.  Respecing specials can take some time that you can avoid.
---
Actual playing you're fine. You can't mess stuff up if you go weird places or miss things
---
Good god I don’t have that level of patience... that being said the trick with the door frames were on point
---
Really? I interpreted as her standing over her monologuing or whatever it would be, post fight about how her mom was this or that, and then she gets blasted. 
---
Somebody above spoiled first so fuck it.   
---
There’s no reason why you should expect it to happen—totally ridiculous—but someone does post about it on here about every few days. 
---
This requires someone finding your camp, but it's kinda humorous if they fall for it.
---
Pretty much, place a porta potty somewhere and apply a level three lock to the door, then leave it open. If some random person comes by and decides to go in and shut the door, they will then be locked in. Granted, they can just fast travel out or disconnect, but it's an amusing situation and mildly inconvenient at worst.
---
However if they do decide to lockpick their way out, they will get a bounty so this could backfire from harmless prank to murder really fast.
---
Hopefully you see this and add it so it gains actual notice from bethesda
---
Railway rifles are bugged and won’t receive buffs from the rifleman set of perk cards
---
Thanks man
---
I like it! I'm not that great at building either but if you ever wanna team up and try, I'd be glad to! I've got tons of resources I could donate to the cause. 
---
And if most of the complains are meaningless bullshit why would they even listen to the subreddit?  (ignoring the argument of if they should be basing their business on an anonymous message board)
---
Unyielding, Berry Mentats, full group and magnetic personality 2* and rank 3 Barter card.
---
If you do partboy you get 3 more charisma from alchohol.
---
Why do you need 6 turrets? That takes up a lot of budget. It may be exceeding the budget accidentally and then when you log off and log in and it's like hey these dont have space to exist so they just disappear. This is just a guess by the way. 
---
Maybe try like 3 turrets and see if it keeps deleting them.
---
I love this game but damn it makes me frustrated. Hope this helps.
---
Offenses are bugged.  File a ticket 
---
You have to drop all your fusion cells and pick them back up.
---
They had these in the concrete building set that was part of the Wasteland Workshop DLC. They had vertical half walls, vertical pillars that could be used as 1/8 walls, horizontal half walls, walls with 45 degree ends, and curved wall sections.
---
What is your total charisma at the end of all that?
---
Seems like something they should include written in the game
---
False. You got to use massive amounts of resources and a story to tell on Reddit. 
---
Look at that glass, it's half full
---
Ill have to replicate it. Did it earlier this morning to help my friend with shocks.
---
Pretty sure they just mean they're working. If the item needs more power, the power icon would be red in build mode. 
---
Anyone find it?
---
pretty sure it was raiders that took the dog, been awhile since I listened to the tape but I don't recall him ever mentioning mutants and the freak show is clearly a raider camp, plus mutants wouldn't torture a guy and his dog like that. 
---
Because a lot of them arent meaningless bullshit.
---
If you get a chance, that sounds like the best combination. Apparently also Ash Rose (something) can stack as well. If you could try all that we can run the numbers and get a bottom line number for the parts.
---
Which based on all the non stop whining on this sub about the nerfs to two shot and explosive is the majority of people here lol.
---
What i have found in my experimenting is that the CAMP device actually does dictate where you spawn at in you base, however the big key here is where you are fast traveling from. So say your base is right by Watoga, if you fast travel from Harpers Ferry you will spawn somewhere different than if you fast traveled from, say, Whitesprings. But you can fast travel from the same one location over and over and will end up at the same location in your base everytime, so we at least know this isnt all just pure random lol. 
---
I personally think your position/direction(where your are in terms of north,south,east,west) from your base, along with the distance between you and your base are two seperate factors instead of one combined factor, but since i cant really make sure im the same distance east as i was west, it kind of hard to test lol. 
---
Sorry if this is common knowledge and everyone already knows all of this. I've just been doing some testing the last 5 or so days and figured id share my 2c on the subject! :) 
---
This super bowl and fallout76 are very similar! Both plauged with mistakes and boring gameplay.
---
Can you build anything new? Would you rather it sit where you get 0 use from it. Or scrap it and use it? 
---
That also happens to me
---
I mean you have to buy them for online games, I think that qualifies them as expansions.  Another bonus for 76 is that it's all free (at least as of now).
---
Problem fixed. Thanks.
---
Same. Got DC’d twice, logged in again, loading currently taking forever :(
---
What weapon are you using? It’s been said it’s based on trigger pulls so autos don’t proc it as much. I personally have seen it proc infrequently on my shredding miniguns but all the time on my two shot pump shotty. Luck 11. 
---
They won't fix anything 
---
That’s what I’m hoping for. Open the vaults and all of a sudden there are human NPCs all over the world with voices missions and such. 
---
I don’t mind the holos and journals, but I don’t like them being the *only* way to learn about stuff. I don’t mind reading a bit, but reading a terminal with 12 2+ page journal entries isn’t really engaging in a video game for me
---
I don't encourage them, I encourage their bans. Though them allowing easy access to practically any sort of gun you could want does expose which perks were in need of a nerf and anything exploitable. Even bugs were seen faster because of them
---
Got to level 120ish and saw one mothman and never a flatwoods...also never saw mothman until level 90 and i hadnt even launched a nuke then :(
---
I'm not saying its not a bug.
---
I could be wrong but from what ive seen and inputs from others it stops at 100%
---
Why anybody would even bother to still play this garbage is beyond me unless you enjoy a game of reports and bans this is definitely the game for you
---
Rebooted the system and nothing was fixed.  Food still does not heal and ammo is gone.  This bug sucks. 
---
Do u know anyone who could make one for me
---
Still enjoying the game when I'm not at work. There are some things i will gripe about from patch 5, but the fact that my most recent queen kill yielded loot for everyone in my crew for the first time since new years was a big improvement.
---
TSE nerf went a little far in my opinion, but its nice to be back in the trenches rather than obliterating every non-SB mob in the game. And my PA randomly unequiping a piece has gotten old. But these are minor compared to the 50+ carry weight i gained from all the aid items now being effected by perks. 
---
I'm on most weekends anyone looking to launch nukes, or anything else hit me up PSN Irishblood1986
---
But you don't have calibrated shocks! 
---
No butterflies as far as I can tell, but i haven't picked up it's diary on the other side of the water if you know what i mean. (;
---
PS4 here played every day this weekend. Not one drop or any issues. Maybe your 56k modern is acting up or you spilled Ovaltine on your PS4. If none of the above I'm  Gonna put this down as fake news and attention seeking behavior.
---
Level 126. No explosive or two shot drops. My trusty Double Crit Damage Gatling Gun shall continue to carry me. 
---
Okay, well sorry. I've got at least 4 other people on here blaming me for being an asshole by offering my stuff to people so I'm a little on edge. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
there are a few that seem to be on repeat sure. but the ones that cant be confirmed and all we have is a vague post, because of all the false clickbait crap, I am starting to just toss into the false pile. which was the point of this post. I was just wondering if anyone else was tired of the boy crying wolf.
---
I am not even saying they are false.true or not doesnt matter.  I am saying a problem might have been created in this reddit that anyone trying to talk about a bug might just be treated like a troll even if they are actually not.
---
Not one for dungeon crawls, but i love the idea.
---
It's an Event ("Feed the People") that is rather notorious for consuming ammo and other goods because the ingredient hopper, for whatever reason, is not limited to the ingredients for that Event.
---
Inside the Vault projects the next update to be mid March. PvP server and some pve content they won't get into until closer to time. The inside the Vault article talks about upcoming projects pretty well, what's immediate and coming down the line
---
This happened to me when I tried crafting that armor. I just assumed it was glitching and I somehow couldn’t use my stash screws. I had everything else on me though. 
---
Got a few more screws around the place and it worked
---
You’re a monster!
---
What do you mean by the new carry weight doesn't work
---
You people must be working for bungie or something, because this is getting ridiculous.
---
Little more help with location would be nice. 
---
I liked seeing the Dude, dude
---
This is indeed a shitpost.
---
I only have 4 base charisma btw. :)
---
We need to be able to cage hostile animals so we can prevent this from happening.
---
The single action really does seem cool. I've only ever found the 1, though.
---
&gt; One of the biggest issues in my opinion is that there is almost no story in 76.
---
Just because you don't pay attention doesn't mean the story isn't there. 
---
Makes me sad... killing the queen is the one thing i feel like I still need to before I can uninstall and move on
---
Mid-March is pretty far away :/
---
I deleted the game once, but reinstalled it later after they patched it, and decided not to play it again a week ago, but changed my mind later. Now, I launched the nuke. Maybe it's time to go.
---
Well I guess I can place CAMP.   If it gets destroyed, scrap the remainder and place a new setup?  I probably can’t make anything new. 
---
Since I spend so much time over encumbered I can’t usually travel back to CAMP anyway and have to spend caps to place it. 
---
And they down vote you. This thread is gone to shit. There is no problem with players, full servers all the time. Why linger in a thread for so long if the game is bad? It's because it's popular and basement dweller hipsters hate things being popular. This negativity will be what makes Reddit a joke, lazy journalists are already doing that... But damn decency is dead.
---
Stay strong. I lost multiple favorite weapons including explosive, bloodied, etc, but it only makes me test new play styles and enjoy the game more. 
---
The same as me it seems. We’re gonna need a true 10 charisma to crack the true bottom dollar.
---
Getting a lot of destiny 2 deja vu on this subreddit lol
---
Ah.  I don't have the flux to spare, sorry.
---
I'm guessing the factory's either Gilman Lumber Mill or WV Lumber Co. Mind you, that doesn't narrow it much, but it's a start.
---
Sorry. Second question.  This is working. However, when she tries to play games in the original system under her profile, it’s saying she can’t.  Do you have that issue?  
---
I doubt they would monetize it like that, but I wouldn't put it past them. I mean our "Respec" is free, and so is the ability to change our appearance
---
It's a month.
---
Yeah I know, but I just really want to change that horrific neon green shit
---
Im talking about the armor perk card.
---
Hello Englebert, meet Balthazar.
---
Agreed, bad press was overblown.
---
I mean, they literally spell out that incisor 2 is equal to incisor 3 with the anti armor on the weapon.
---
And that it only gets more complicated if you wanna use an armor pen weapon mod.
---
The post literally says the best bet is to get incisor 2 anti armor legendary, then use a bleed or high damage weapon mod.
---
Yep, more than double most times.
---
When it does load, several times now I have been killed by invisible enemies (just not loaded textures I assuming) that don't become visible until the camera pans out to show you dead.
---
You a surviving not suffering!!! Have you learned nothing from this post?
---
Basically you're saying we're all [Clem from Vault Tec Workshop](https://youtu.be/r8PR7SIvcnU?t=236), right?
---
Lol watching this game dissolve like an toilet paper. 
---
Sadly, very accurate
---
Flatwoods monster attacked my CAMP.  Crazy experience.
---
Thats what they did in ESO
---
Because you didn't pay attention. 
---
&gt;Don't they all have player specific loads so everyone get the overseer stuff? As in. I take my share you still have yours... so if I put stuff in there doesn't it just disappear to the ether?
---
Things like the boiled water and dog food that spawn in the chest are instanced, but Anthon placed in there by a player will show up for anyone else who looks. 
---
Did not know this. Will be dropping all cool shit in there from now on thanks 
---
Don't forget the community too they are going away fast.
---
Eh? I launched my first one and she just bitched at me. I launched it at the top of the world..
---
It sounded like the mire from their description.
---
 I hate vague posts like this though. Just use spoiler tags. The map is huge and there is a ton of unmarked spots and water. 
---
I broke my Two shot explosive flamer, froze the queen 3 times with Furious cryolator, and almost broke my Furious gatlin plasma. Damage should be enough.
---
The breaking part is the charisma card and having a full group I think. And Im unsure if one group member shares 1* and the other 2* card if they stack like so many other perks do.
---
Well said my friend. That's why its important to defend things you believe in them even if its unpopular. 
---
That's what I'm thinking. I've heard budget goes up with level but I am not sure if that is true. 
---
Wouldn’t those be much more likely to be found...? They’re locked away. Like you said. 
---
So the overseer is dead?  How did she know I launched a nuke...she seems mighty pissed off
---
Plus the shredder attack on miniguns. 
---
I got my first explosive weapon 3 weeks ago at level 93. It was a hunters Gatling laser. The explosive effect is glitched where it just does whatever the normal damage would be without the effect, even after the nurf. But in the recent patch Bethesda made it so laser weapons could not drop with the explosive effect because it was not intended. But luckily it still has the effect on it post patch and was not effected by the nurf, possibly because of it's not supposed to have the effect in the first place. I should also mention that the demolition perks also have no effect on it at all with it doing a consistent 50 damage with or without it (50 dmg from laser +50dmg from explosion) 
---
it’s over a month &amp; the game has been stagnant for more than just the start of february. 
---
I completely forgot about the concrete ones. I rarely built with concrete, but I definitely remember wishing the other wooden stuff had vertical half-walls
---
I just tested here (on PC) to confirm it and, yes, that also happened to me. Yep, 773 fusions cells, gone for real
---
Better than the ranged weapons in this game.
---
Are you going for headshots, makes a big difference, belly for deathclaws.
---
How do you even find the flatwoods monster? I’ve been around Abbie’s bunker a dozen times and never saw him
---
I actually love this idea. Thank you good sir! 
---
If you press the pickup buttion too fast, you may end up exiting your power armor! I had this problem twice, died immediately.
---
Whatever
---
&gt; (I'm in middle)
---
Can barely see you thanks to the guitar. 
---
Wait didnt they add an ability to go to another server?
---
Or did they roll that back too?
---
This is the kind of posts we should have in this sub. Thank you 
---
(Not /s, I'm serious)
---
Champion of Nurgle
---
Don’t leave, I’ve never left either, I’ve heard on the surface they’ve taken away something called “TeeEsEee” from the survivors and everyone is pretty salty about it. Also everyone up there is obsessed with weight loss or something, who cares.
---
Oh you killed a few people? Well now everyone can do a bunch of damage to you, and you can't touch them.
---
It sounds like they are investing in the Austin team and expanding the number of developers that can work on fallout games.
---
Takes time for devs to ramp up. I hope they don't read anything from this subreddit and get discouraged.
---
I press kinda in pattern kinda to make sure thats not possibe 
---
Is ESO on the Creation engine? 
---
Remember that the raider was a just a boy that got turned away thus becoming a raider down the line, she was pissed about that too, about deciding who's worth to save and who can rot away in the wasteland
---
You wont ruin it by giving me the location cuz I have no clue where that would be
---
I have 4 not 6, sorry shouldnt have exaggerated, but even if i did have 6, i have the budget (which I hope they increase even 1.5× larger) but shit still disappears and its sad. Especially when it costs to rebuild them. Its also happened to a water purifier and generators, again I almost always have a tiny bit of budget left for that reason in case ya know?
---
 I really hope they fix the bugs and server issues, then start adding new missions and events and shit to do, cause I like it a lot also, but the bugs man, piss me off lol.
---
I also hope they add solo servers soon too, so that enemies spawn near my level and not "XXXpussyslayerXXX's" level 80 spawns. And for some of the more tedious grinding solo servers would he great. Just you, or you and 3 friends would be the shit. 
---
Marathoner and White Knight don’t work on power armor. 
---
[insert image of vault boy saying "excuse me what the fuck" here]
---
Me too! And every time he shot my turrets they would glow purple. 
---
Melee one shot stuff. Dont bother with Guns.
---
You carry more then one.
---
They did!
---
Things feel real fresh when everyone has to switch builds, farm mutations, and hunt down gear again lol
---
Use your stash. Find perks that help your carry weight. Alcohol helps me fast travel when I'm over weight. You should find a place to build a camp imo. 
---
Breach and Clear event. Get all the metals but make sure you have acid. 
---
"This guy" It's you, this is your youtube channel.
---
They said they increased the character carry weight by 1500 pounds mine still reads 375
---
I've found it btween relay tower EL-B1-02 and Johnson's acre multiple times. Maybe check that area out?
---
Can you sharpen your hint a bit? The game's challenges are very loose on what they call factories, and include power stations and dams. Do you mean an actual factory that made stuff? 
---
Going there now 
---
Yep happens to me too. If it’s anything but the queen I just move on. If you sit there long enough it’ll show up eventually. With the queen it’s usually after it’s turned into a meat pile and then you have to figure out which one it is lol
---
Eh, that doesn't work because if you move the camp device around you change where you spawn. I've got mine set up so that I appear right in the middle of the first floor of my main building. Took a little tweaking but now it's perfect. Safe arrival every time :D
---
I've seen him twice, once in the Ash Heap and once he attacked my camp near the Alpha Silo.
---
Find their bear rug and lay down on it. Take a photo right when they walk in and discover you. 
---

Hey, I just want my hulkbuster power armor so I can arm wrestle with the Grafton monster.
---
Paint looks awesome.  Doesnt work on Western, so I didnt buy it.
---
:0
---
SNOWFLAKE
---
Who's to say I don't *enjoy* Bird Bones?
---
You get them in the “quest” to find the t51b nuka cola paint job, there are a few outfits in there with it. 
---
Bone Worms really get me off tbqfh
---
Definitely added to the list of things to do. Thanks lol 
---
??? No context? 
---
So far I've been enjoying the main story more than I have with 3 and 4 
---
There’s no fun in just giving out the location, I just wanted to inform you all that they do exist and help a little.
---
I feel like I’ve become good friends with my radworms. They keep me company in this desolate place. 
---
Scratch that I did that event a few weeks ago but I was by the waterpark when this happened. 
---
I hear that meat hooks count as both fist and one-handed like the M79 used to be both explosive and shotgun. Barring the hook, the top fists are Mole Miner's, Deathclaw gauntlet, and the Power Fist.
---
If you plan on nuke zones, you cannot use PA. You can though PA does have unarmed mods, they will not stack up to your legendaries.
---
I suggest making a bloodied build with a backup berserker set up. You should be able to find either of these relatively easy online
---
the last time i put an 8gb single stick in this board it refused to post, i have like 50gb worth of ddr3, im trying to get on ddr4 soon with a new build, i have an am3+ board with 4 slots of ram but it has an athlon in it and my fx will not post on that board
---
No they made the max over encumbered weight be 1500 pounds over you max carry weight. They did this to kill duper mule accounts. Not increase your carry weight
---
I usually run.
---
I dont know if it's a server lag issue or a mob loading issue. So I run to watoga and it takes time and forces the reload
---
i might try some of this thanks
---
!RemindMe 7 days
---
Its not working because your reading comprehension failed you. The total carry weight for a character now has a hard limit like the character stash, that limit is 1500.
---
Artistic hardly. It’s easy being down. It’s harder to find humor in the darkness. That’s art. 
---
&gt;Does the game have bugs? sure, but are they a numerous or serious at people make it out to be? 
---
lol
---
Ah I see
---
As speed Jesus said "there is no right way to play fallout". Do what *you* find fun in the game.
---
Example: Building a camp for me is one of the least entertaining things of the game but it is useful for free travel, crafting and repair - so just make the bare minimum to get you by, you may end up enjoying it and want to make a mansion like others here. I recently had to build walls on my current one because I built it high up and fell off due to not paying attention too often. Before that it was a 6x6 floor with crafting benches and a stash box.
---
With the quests: run around doing the side quests if you like them, leave the main quests for a while because if you do it too fast you will be underlevelled for the new areas &amp; some item rewards are locked to the level you did the quest in and cannot be upgraded.
---
I can’t believe this man thought they gave us 1500 personal carry weight lmao 
---
Barely. Looking at the humor within other fallouts makes this look gaunt 
---
Has dysentery been acknowledged?
---
It’s up there with explosive diarrhea 
---
Runs pretty much the same for me between when I started on OG and currently on an X. Game is much prettier on an X though. 
---
Ugh my main did that and the tattered dress to get the garb 🤦‍♂️
---
😂 
---
SNAFU.
---
That being said I am still having fun.
---
Sadly, yes, and a while ago too. I used to trust everything people said here and felt bad for them. Then I realized the trade steal glitch was absolute bullshit, and then I realized the phantom weight was absolute bullshit, and then I realized one-shotting outside of combat was absolute bullshit, and then I realized the bans for unobtrusive PC mods was absolute bullshit, and the rest started slowly falling apart. Even though I know by their nature many bugs are not consistent for every player, I rarely believe anything I see here unless I have personally experienced it. Thanks to fake news, nobody can be taken seriously here anymore. If they can't get the attention then nobody else can either
---
Sad :(
---
You shouldn't even be able to unintentionally put any item besides the dehydrated food mix it's meant for. During that same event I hadta deposit more dehydrated food mix and hoped my combat armor was still there and the damn thing tried taking my fusion cell ammo. 
---
I play pacifist and nuke random players when they cross my path. 
---
You absolutely should be skeptical... but the game is a buggy mess. That is the real trouble, because of how buggy the game is and how much it has under performed all the BS *sounds* plausible. 
---
Yeah that’s just the power light, it looks like an energy meter to me that’s at a 3/5. Like battery icon. Anyway it’s always on 3 and the meter doesn’t rise or fall, although that would be cool that when it filled to the top, that’s when a bother fusion core was just created. 
---
Referring, I think, to the sudden demands for "proof" of all these bugs. As if there's some kind of conspiracy to hurt Bethesda with fake bug reports.
---
Charging mods for the tesla rifle causing players to crash (when meleed).
---
So the way the enemy level works is based off of what section of the map. So like the forest will spawn 1-20 level enemies where as the savage divide will spawn level 30-100 enemies. That's how that works. 
---
Onto the camp. I've yet had that happen to me where something disappears and I have to rebuild it. It usually ends up as a blueprint or stored. 
---
I only have one rocket turret and it works good enough. It doesn't kill everything but I'm in the savage divide so that's on me. 
---
That sucks your shit is disappearing. Wish I could help. 
---
Better luck than me. My first two shot was level 115 or so. My first tse was level 125ish right after then nerf lol. Glad to see it was a good shotty with some damage at least.
---
Just uninstalled in solidarity.
---
Dont remember, i stopped playing when i hit Champ lvl 851
---
They are owned by players now. Whoever calls it in, they own it.
---
Get a sub 20 to team with you. Get them to walk into WS first and you’re gravy. Assuming no one else is anywhere near by. 
---
I've considered doing a mini nuke build just to mess with people in pacifist mode lol. Sounds like it's pretty funny. 
---
Fuck yeah boy!
---
Did you find the holotape of the human changing into a supermutant.
---
There's 2-3 interesting tapes in there, although I didn't find the serums, someone must have taken them, Virgil maybe.
---
Usually happens to me when I gooify something  with plasma
---
West Virginia. 
---
Cool 
---
Some folks here want to constantly be entertained. They feel entitled and cheater when they’re immediately satisfied. 
---
I agree the game is what you make of it
---
You didnt help tho. There are tons of locations with bodies of water and factories. Idk about other but I'm just gonna assume you're trolling until someone else gives the location or at least a better idea on where it is
---
What if becoming a supermutant made it so your max strength and endurance was now 20, but your intelligence and perception maxed out at 10. 
---
Give some more flexibility with the cards and play styles 
---
This was since that last major patch. Again I wasn't counting the Whitespring nukes.
---
Please don't fall for this folks. This sort of thing would have been found by now many times over and Youtube videos or screenshots would have been shared. Not sure if the OP really craves attention but this is a bad way of getting it.
---
great description.
---
I’ll have to check that out
---
Chainsaw, farmhand clothes, and... What's that gas mask Op?
---
Haha, if that’s what you took from that post than good for you. Try not to have a heart attack we’re all here for you if you need to talk. 
---
I fought the Flatwoods Monster outside silo Charlie. 
---
Had enough of Dysentery, on board for the explosive diarrhea though, great way to cut excess weight after the holidays
---
No I'm not going to fix any of that. Try asking a support ticket. We aren't bethesda. 
---
How in the world would you "know" you had to kill the Flatwoods Monster first?
---
Awesome 
---
Looks like they issued a hot-fix near the end of the game.
---
What happens when you first login? Does the floor form around you and you have to jump once to get on top? 
---
I honestly think the move the CAMP around to change the spawn point is a bug, I like that they let us move it, but it doesn’t make sense to calculate the position based on its location instead of the actual camp location....
---
Steelworkers and tattered hood :D
---
No new content yet, depending on why you quit it may be worth it to watch for the update coming next month. If it was due to a lack of content or meaningful PvP, that's what to look into. I doubt it was due to bugs but all updates so far have been dedicated to bug fixes and nerfs
---
my first nuke drop was on the queen, fast traveled nearby, opened pip to change perks.....and froze.  
---
id killed the queen before, but I was excited for it to be MY queen. 
---
Play a build you enjoy playing instead of trying to chase meta build. Some players think they should have one shot builds with 4 points in damage modifier perks. The fact is that builds are comprehensive to all of the perks. Any build is viable if you enjoy playing it. Explosive builds using duped TSEs were META, now it is melee builds. The truth is you can make any specific spec into an end game build. 
---
I'm calling b******* until I see more proof.  A screenshot of the hatch would not blow the location
---
Xanax is a depressive. Please no one take Xanax for depression. 
---
LMAO
---
worth it 
---
And dysentery really conjures nostalgic vibes from happy times playing Ozark Trail. Let’s not make dysentery sound like it’s always a bad thing.
---
And even if it weren’t an associative memory, who doesn’t love a good shit?
---
I was hoping that them mentioning new Vaults opening meant exactly this! They have to do *something* to make the game feel more alive.
---
He’s the one who gave me Radworms 
---
Idk what that SBQ did to the man in the robe but it looks like he got a sex change lol.
---
I was gonna post this.. spoiler!
---
I will be on in about an hour after this post is up
---
I lost interest in wow when they eliminated the skill tree. Now everyone is an expert class builder 
---
It’s not real, he just got his friends to roleplay like randoms. All of these trap videos could only work if set outside of vault 76 for new guys that are level 1 and don’t even know about fast travel yet.
---
Grind for the sake of grind.
---
i agree in full. though the fusion cell wasn’t a huge loss lol
---
dunno what I'm even looking at :/
---
it comes down to this with my 15 char and 3* hard bargain
---
No worries man, im set up right next to vault 76, level 44, do you stop getting special points after 50?
---
Right. The writer didn't do a good job so it's the players fault.
---
Heck no. BGS will take that idea and give you bad karma for just standing in another players personal space or if too many people gang up on the SBQ
---
At level 51 and on you have the option each level to either choose a perk card or swap a point from on special to another.
---
Can't even get 100% since it won't allow damage resist to go below 1% because that's the way the Fallout formula handles it but it is possible on paper (and some games actually handle it that way) to have over 100% armor reduction since that just means you could do more than your full listed damage at negative values.
---
Turrets would make a difference 
---
Best Fat Man I found was an Executioner that does more damage the lower the enemy's health was, I think. I just hopped off and forgot to check it lol. Bonus: it only weighs 2 pounds.
---
But yes, after the patch, my powder rifle only does about 350 per shot. Sad face.
---
Craft or find a Syringer. Have somebody craft the Karma barrel and it you will have it. The only way to keep it at this time.
---
Do whatever you want as long as its fun, that’s what the best mmo worlds allow. As far as camp, it’s basically just a space for you to build a house/camp to store your stuff. If you want to learn just ask me or anyone on here  how to do a specific thing and I’m sure people will help you. I spend most of my time building on my camp and collecting power armor 
---
Ahh i see, so just tweaking then really? Dang lol, i have high strength, endurance and intelligence, i need to get my perception and luck up before its too late lol. 
---
Actually it is to support complaints against them. 
---
Given the massive amount of people who can't answer simple questions and just down vote anyone who dosen't agree with them. Proof is needed to show it is a good faith complaint. 
---
We have literally reached the point the definition of a survival game vs a horror survival is considered semantics.  
---
Try modding your weapons for critical, armour-piercing and hip-fire. Get the VATS/Critical perks and use targeted head shots in VATS.
---
6 Perception - lvl 3 tank killer, lvl 3 concentrated fire
---
15 Agility - lvl 3 action boy/girl, lvl 3 sneak, lvl 3 covert operative, escape artist, lvl 3 gunfu, lvl 2 adrenaline 
---
15 Luck - lvl 3 psychopath (until you need starched genes), lvl 3 four leaf clover, lvl 3 grim reapers spring, lvl 3 critical savy, lvl 3 better criticals
---
you don't really need weapon perk cards to make a sneak/crit/VATS character work, just need a weapon that can be silenced and modified for critical. Thne Its just a matter of getting comfortable at closing the gap to get nearly in an enemies face once Adrenaline kicks in and GunFu powers up. I'd suggest starting off with a 10mm/pipe pistol early game, moving to a lever action at 35. Then when you have bullets coming out your ears, because you're one taping 95% of enemies with the lever action and want to make the move to full-auto VATS Critical insanity, a 10mm pistol/combat rifle/combat shotgun/handmade.
---
*shakes fist*
---
Sack hood
---
Okay so during the quest you can make more than one? Hmm that would work.
---
Apparently not as I have spawned inside all of those.
---
Like totally! 😂
---
Hai!
---
Yeah the prototype hazmat suit is yellow too. Seems like all the proptyoe stuff is yellow in this game, and it’s all the coolest stuff. It’s almost like a rarity color like purple/blue in some games for rare and legendary.
---
Looks like he glitched himself out of the map boundaries. 
---
K just curious cause if so then this is totally doable in 76. 
---
Seriously? Dataminers, is there anything to what OP's saying? 
---
Just sold my straight jacket and fedora. Could have been a party. 
---
Looks like White Knight wasn't nerfed for everyone.
---
No it wouldn't have been a huge loss but after what had just happened I wasn't letting that damn machine take anything else from me.
---
And yet still plenty to do for me. 
---
“Welcome to the wasteland, gee you’ve got a purty mouth, stranger...”
---
The vaults are obviously there for DLC. Its an easy way for them to introduce new content.
---
Are there any vaults in WV that we havent found?
---
I had the same thing happen 2 patches back.  Lost all my .308.  Never found a solution 
---
I maxed my intelligence and now I only have 9. with like 13 strength and 9 endurance. I'm level 83. I'm forming more into a soak up damage kinda build I think. Idk I'm freestyling lol 
---
Another helpful tip
---
Each endurance point adds 10 hp. Each strength point adds 5 carry weight. And each agaility adds 10 ap.
---

I call me mines Jim
---
I don't believe half the complaints.  When simple questions aren't answered and definitions become semantics. The community just wants to complain. 
---
I'm saving my atoms for a good skin from the store.
---
Same. This would have been found by now unless this is made up for upvotes. I can vaguely post theres a loch ness monster in the game in some lake by a tree and you only see it if you're wearing a gas mask in your undies. Doesnt make it real. Sorry dude. Need more proof. 
---
I mean it is 2102 times have changed.
---
This is hillarious 
---
I've taken many workshops since the beta and the disconnects/crashes only happened a few times for me. Lately the biggest annoyance is other ppl coming to take over a place that I've claimed for what it seems to be only for PVP purposes since after they've claimed it from me, they just fast travel away and don't do anything with the place. I went and tried to fight back one time to see what it was about, just to be greeted with by a person jumping all over the place with a TSE shotgun. From that point I decided it was not worth it to bother going back to claim back a workshop that someone took from me, that it was just a waste of time and caps.
---
Oooh doing this! Potty trauma!
---
So long as we don't move from that to being single player and then to being offline, it sound fantastic!

Dialogue system with NPCs wouldn't hurt either.

I HAVE THE SAME GUN! It’s honestly amazing!! Congrats 😭😍

Yeah I haven’t seen my toad in a while but I see something has a 10% hold.  Would be nice to be able to dismiss them or something.

Mole Miner is usually bread and butter. I think you can get them starting at level 20. Good to farm three or more to have on you so you can cycle through and prevent breakage. Farm Blackwater Mine ever 10 levels to make sure you are doing all the damage you can. You'll eventually get something really good like a Deathclaw Gauntlet or Power Fist, but in the meantime go the way of the mole.
---
Also, Incisor, Marital Artist, and Iron Fist are your friends, obviously. 3 points in First and and another 3 in Born Survivor are points well spent. By not having to go through the animation of taking a stimpak, you can swing all the way through any combat encounter without hurting your DPS or fearing death. If you run low on Stimpaks you can do Mayor for a Day in Watoga even at level 2 if you are sneaky enough. Free unlimited stims off the rip!
---
&gt; they literally spell out that incisor 2 is equal to incisor 3 with the anti armor
---
That's because armor values don't go high enough for the marginal increase to have enough of an affect on your damage. They literally give you the calculated values for them at "tldr2" with Incisor 2 on AA weapon with armor reduction mod at 87.5% and Incisor 3 at 90.6% so it did make a difference but just not enough to have a worthwhile affect on your damage.
---
Theres no disease cure for that its a permanent effect in game the only way to get rid of jt is either killing yourself or make a new character
---
Oh the writers did a great job. Just because you ignored it dosen't degrade their quality of work.
---
Do you know how and why Charleston is destroyed?
---
Do you know why the Mistress of Mystery house is abandoned?
---
I don't judge you for being dense like that.  Much.  It happens.
---
There is no wrong way to play these games.
---
Maybe this subreddit finally stopped trying to defend the game ... 
---
Get downvoted into oblivion!

Later on, I’ll introduce you to Penelope.
---
I have my house open for people to use. I'd love it if I could have a guestbook where anyone who came could sign

yes happens a lot.  pretty sucky.

The only wrong way to play, is to play as someone else wants you to play.

Its actually 2101, and fallen out of fashion again.

Definitely going to try that rifle as well - thanks for the tip!
---
Yeh i got zip last night. Xp yeh but no damn loot. 
---
That's really sad to hear, I feel like the game is probably abandoned at this point 
---
You sure told him.
---
good idea man, i'd like that too
---
It's been happening to my lamps, generators, water purifiers, walls, etc.. nothing is safe. I've been getting a "camp cannot be placed" error way more often than usual, and no one else is there. I can literally place my camp where it should be, but it's always missing something.
---
Politely ask them to turn it up.
---
Peg
---
Do you have better clues to add? 
---
Proof?
---
pretty much.  they might try to get a real game designer and someone who knows how to work a debugger on it, or just let it go.  hard to say.
---
Probably a mod, trying to stop rumors from getting started. Rule 7, and all.
---
Hahaha i can't wait

I believe it represents if the extractor has stuff in it.

I love it.  Decent range.  And even better damage in sneak (which I primarily use)

I noticed that after my team disbanded last night that marsupial (possibly all other mutations as well) stopped functioning... I think the strange in numbers bug is back. That would explain my experience anyway.
---
Very top floor of the Palace of the Winding Path on the balcony. 
---
Glad im not the only one, i had to build a structure and put most things inside and it seems like if i get the cannot be placed message its a bit safer and most things are still inside the house if not all, building on flat land is the best option, or somewhere others wont/too hard for it to auto place i guess. They need to fix it though 
---
Although, sometimes that "known" flag doesn't work for me.. I spend the caps to buy an unknown  plan, read it, then get an error saying I already know it.. then the flag changes in my inventory afterward
---
Pegging the post so I can come back to it. I'm not at my Xbox right now 😂
---
I feel you pain.
---
Yeah idk. Already get an extra 25% from talon and twisted muscles stacks on that. Can use both unarmed and melee bobbleheads at the same time, plus fury. Kinda seems like if my unarmed did any more damage I would be writing to Bethesda myself to talk about how unfair it is haha.
---
u/ladydevann can you confirm? 
---
Also needs the wildman rags or grognak costume for full effect
---
My go-to for caps is the Billings Homestead Workshop. With the green thumb perk, you can harvesst 200+ Razorgrain there, and ~130 corn next door at Silva Homestead. (The food weight reduction perk helps too) You used to be able to server hop and the field would be full again, but I think they changed that last patch. Like others have said, raw flux is the best source of vendor fodder, but billings is nice for when there are no nukes on the map. You can also find a fusion core in power armor in the shed between the two farms, tons of steel lying around, and the red barn at silva homestead has several bags of chlorine for acid. 
---
Ya i know that tip from the previous fallouts, or figured anyways thanks tho man. U on ps4 by chance
---
ohh lol
---
😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
I didn't find it but I did find a 3* fog crawler who dropped an Assassin's Sentinel combat left arm.
---
Of course I don't PvP......go figure.
---
Username raises some suspicions...
---
Server side bugs don't have to affect all clients. 
---
If a server side bug affects everyone its an easy bug to find.
---
The writer did not do a great job. As I stated, the villain's motivation lacked credibility. You seem to think that because you know the why means that it's believable. 
---
Noice

Currently not even worth the food and stimpacks it takes to wait for her to land and melee her to death
---
Can't uninstall that $59.99 tho
---
I don't meet the first one as I'm on xbox, but this peaks my interest, any hints? 
---
Gonna need a lil more proof. Like a video or some shit, maybe location
---
It feels like you have to do a certain percentage of the total damage to get loot. I've tagged several scorch beasts and received nothing, but when I get a substantial amount of damage in I always seem to get loot. 
---
I have killed over a dozen Flatwoods Monsters and scoured every body of water I ran into since day 1 of beta. At level 200 and all I confirm under water are random safes with a level 3 lock skill requirement and meh loot. The only notable underwater "cave" system is in a mining site if I recall. One that had a cage that was locked and you had to find a key to open it...been forever, but the main quest lead you there. I swam in that water for over an hour, it just brings you out to different parts of the mine itself and no hatches.
---
Why have you avoided answering my direct questions?
---
You need peeps with guns and cripple to down her. Harder now since most ppl going melee.
---
You can't destroy stairs or floors. I don't think you're actually a raider, else you'd know that.

I'm level 61 and still have no legendary weapon drops. Only ever had armour. 
---
People found a way to dupe with it so they shut 2 of them down
---
Share a screenshot of an alien and we will find them
---
XB1, yes, takes a wee bit longer.
---
I got a faster way for you! Farm wendigos, or even better megasloths. They drop \~6 screws per kill. Just server hop at a location near where one of these creatures spawns. At over lvl 30 you should have something that can one-shot  them. Log out, log back in, rinse and repeat. Hundreds of screws per hour.
---
Because you are trying get into a pointless pissing match to try to support your idea that the why is the same as the believing.
---
Since day 1
---
Thanks! appreciate it.
---
Hahahh
---
As great as this is,  we really shouldn't have to be jumping through hoops to make cool camps.
---
👏 disable 👏 build 👏 clipping 👏
---
That's not a bug, it's a patch to prevent duping. Just move down to the next terminal.
---
Since beta (I've been reporting it since then at least) you were able to sell something to a MODUS terminal and have your friends buy 3 copies of it. They finally did something about it.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by original system. Like after she logs back in as her? I havent had that issue. Did you log in as you on her system and start downloading? Then she can log in once it starts
---
I intentionally set up a "landing area" beforehand where the "floor" is just barely above ground level then moved the camp device around until I land on it. So, I appear on the ground and it spawns around me then it automatically "bounces" me up the few inches to be on top of it.
---
If it is a bug I hope they never fix it or they only fix it by adding a welcome mat or similar object to let us manually set it because I would hate to have to tweak the design of my building around the spawn point. I'd *do it*, but I'd hate it.
---
Lol love it

Luckily for you guys I have a clue I recorded this by accident but hey it’s something close to op

Wait no legendary drops at all? Have you not made it to White Springs I'm assuming?
---
Roadmap:
---
People have burned through all the content, time to nerf everything.
---
No I'm trying to see if you actually paid attention.  I've seen many people complain about the story and asked similar questions and they have yet to reply to my inquiries. 
---
I can clear that up for you. When a creature is engaged with anything, it can't be sneak-attacked. Because it has detected an enemy and is fighting.  The fact that it can't see YOU doesn't matter. The second it is out of active combat it can take sneak attack damage again.
---
I actually don't mind the yellow - I think it's kinda cool. I just have been looking at things in the store to spend my atoms on and the paint jobs (camo and American) appeal to me, but they can't be used on the power armor I have. 
---
1. PS4

---
\*\*\*Spoilers  below\*\*\*
---
3. If DCed (which happens pretty often) my quest progress doesn't seem to be saving.   
---
It's happened for a number of smaller quests. Not a big deal for them, but I spelunked pretty far down into the Glassed Cavern for the BoS quests when I got DCed. Nevermind that getting into damn thing is bad enough with all the scorched beasts and minions running around the entrance pit. I logged back in, went through the whole cave including the boss. Hit the red button at the end thinking that was part of the quest because it had a marker and it spit me out exit-only style at the bunker. Thinking I must have missed something I run back through the cave (again). Thankfully most of the mobs hadn't respawned. Get to the end and still couldn't find anything for the quest. I look back at my map and the god damn quest progress reset to finding the first BoS signal between Fort Defiance and  Watoga. Huge timesink... and I'm still gonna have to go through the cavern yet again.   
---
I've dealt with most of the minor bug irritations of this game in good stride, but this one has a particularly bad aftertaste.    
---
On a positive note, thank you for the visual representation for the learnt plans and recipes. I can definitely appreciate the QoL improvements. 
---
Oh right, thanks. Maybe they could put an \[OUT OF ORDER\] tag on it or something.
---
Did you just assume my condition?
---
You'd think that they'd take feedback from fo4 and make it better than before.. but nah. 
---
Really not a huge fan of the building system at all,  and I love building.
---
Maybe. Might've been cool if the ones you couldn't use were turned off.
---
Depending on how many players are around you get assigned one that you can use. It changes and won't always be the same one. A visual cue would've been nice, I suppose.
---
And I didn't "suffer water loss from dysntery," the water was ejected from me as I violently diarrhead into my power armor.
---
Sounds like a bug to me. Hopefully it gets brought to the dev's attention and addressed.
---
*bye*
---
I had it do that to me to but the plan was one I know I didn't know and the plan was used up.
---
Nah xbox one man
---
Thank you
---
Uh can we do something about MODUS smiling like a creep mobile?
---
My complaint is about a very specific aspect of the story. If I wasn't paying attention that would imply an entirely different issue with the writers ability.
---
Dropped her twice today.  Not a lot of players, used more ammo than usual, good times.
---
I guarantee you, you do not have a full set of "that gear" without getting it from other players. Im 800 hours deep and have seen 1 cavalier/assassin piecee, let alone 0 sentinels/assassins.
---
No need to lie, just be honest how you got your gear.
---
Is that the cheap knockoff of the Oregon Trail? Like the ozark to yeti thing?
---
If it's on the internet it must be true
---
Excellent posted question, on point with my own thoughts and the answers have basically freed me from worrying about rad resist in normal armor.
---
Normal armor seems to be for decoration mostly with a few token resists to play with, will have to use power armor when needed and rely on mutations, foods and chems when steppin' out in my handy dandy leather togs :)
---
All this time limited stuff is bullshit. Just put it on the store permanently. There is no reason to time the 'sale'.
---
you only need 1 on you. i avoid pvp anyway, i cant see how anyone would want to touch it.
---
Same goes for chameleon, cant vats if in stealth.
---
You try quitting and reloading?
---
If nothing else move camp so it BP it all the scrap the BP
---
except Ozark is better
---
As long as a player with negative karma can be seen on the map it will be shit gameplay.
---
Oh for real. That’s why I’m wondering where I can get The Ozark Trail.
---
I found a lvl 35 junkies exploding about a month ago. 2 weeks ago I got an anti armor exploding hunting rifle. Lots of crappy 2 shot pipe pistols too. Never a tse though.
---
Walmart obviously
---
Already did that, even deleted and reinstalled the game nothing worked. 
---
Find the wild friendly rats up north. 
---
This is why I think we are in a simulation.
---
She'd have to be outside, notice what we did, make a tape, and leave it for us Easter Bunny style.
---
That bit makes no sense otherwise.
---
Sounds like you don’t like to read?  Because there are a ton of compelling stories, in notes and terminals in addition to quests and holotapes.  It’s just not spoon-fed to you.
---
And why isn't it credible?
---
That sucks, but this kind of stuff has been a problem since Beta.  When I posted a thread about it saying this was a very serious problem almost everyone told me how it was my fault for not blue printing it or something like that.
---
Some of them even accused me of trolling. 
---
What changed since then? Just curious.
---
But they won't be getting any more money from me, that's for sure.
---
Great job trapping your friends that's totally believable ;) 
---

Marsupial Mutation isn’t working, even though all my other mutations are. I’m not overencumbered. I swear I’m jumping lower than I would even without Marsupial. Switching servers fixed it, but when I switched to another it was broken again.
---
that angle reminds me clover from cloverfield
---
Also if someone is using another terminal in the bunker all terminals are will be busy.
---
I'm curious are they still any good after the nerfs?
---
You probably had one stray shot hit one of the robots. They don't forgive any damage. Change servers or stay away from White Springs for 10-20 minutes to reset agro.
---
If you use a gauss rifle or explosive weapon, the splash damage will aggro the bots of they are close to your target 
---
Take your points out of perception, that perk is useless if you get the grounded mutation. Add 3 points to luck for Bloody mess. You have too much in endurance IMO, would just run Ironclad at Max and fireproof if you want. Need 5 in intelligence with Makeshift warrior maxed, unless you want to be repairing your weapon a lot. 
---
I have gotten mods unlocked post patch from marine arms just missing buttressed leg mod now, crafted over 200 pieces this weekend no mod yet.
---
It just costs a lot of resources to fight her. Not to mention her loot hasn't been loading regularly. It's frustrating. 
---
Wellbutrin, then it will help you stop smoking and work on your adhd as well. I take duloxetine, but I have to for pain management as I am not allowed muscle relaxers or anti-inflammatory meds. 
---
It’s not much of an inconvenience.
---
I would have rather been playing FO76... Not sure what that means.
---
Find a less popular location.
---
Wow, I dump mine when I get above 10, they are too heavy for me, and I keep finding them. 
---
Relog?
---
Yes the whole frames! You can think that maybe you can be clumpsy and maybe lost 1 by accident, maybe placing it in the world with the "R" and lost one, yes, but the 3 frames...itss a shame.
---
I've tried that a couple of times and they're still the same level, is there any way I can choose the server I log into or is it always the same one?
---
Nice but that's not the true bob ross. [This is the True Bob Ross.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAGargyyIPQ)
---
They will never patch at that depth of game design/mechanics. You're talking about a fundamental level of design that can't be modified in isolation AND will ripple throughout many connecting systems. No chance that amount of redesign work will be justified at the production/expense level.
---
They unfortunately designed their systems poorly and they're here to stay.
---
They tend to get sharp when eating them. It is bad to have your throat cut from the inside-out. 
---
So let's see a picture of one of them aliens. That won't spoil the location
---
Is this even possible as you have to kill things for quests?
---
I had been rushing to the nuke zone to kill her every time someone dropped  a nuke there.   I wanted plans for calibrated shocks to increase my carry weight on that armor. 
---
The queen drops the plans  and as far as I know there is no other way to get them.
---
After killing and looting her over 20 times (I lost count) I had 20 plans for explosive vents, a bunch of legendary wooden  pieces, and plans to build a full suit  of power armor that I didn't need to build because I already the full suit. 
---
What possible sane reason is there to keep subjecting myself to that crap?  
---
I can't think of one, so I don't. 
---
Oh man the smell. Just scrap all of thtlat PA set. 
---
Movement works. Shooting works. Killing stuff without TSE guns works. Adventure still works.  Not sucking still works
---
Are you sure I should go on?
---
I have my faschnacht man mask, a clown suit, and a vampire's cultist's dagger. Let's party
---
Yeah of course. Are they as good? Obviously not, but nothing is. The biggest drawback of shotguns wasn't a lack of damage, but rather hitting all the pellets on 1 mob. Explosive makes every pellet hit and at 20% damage increase. That's on top of whatever your main modifier is, so could be upwards of 50% damage increase on one of the hardest hitting gun types in the game. If you're looking for god mode guns, they don't exist anymore.
---
Try two-handing chest
---
Relogging usually changes what server you are on. There isn’t a way of choosing servers except if you join up on a friends server that was different from your previous server.
---
If this problem persists, I’d recommend request a friend to act as a bodyguard for you and help clear mobs for you.
---
this is why I stopped sneaking in this game.
---
Ahh okay, thank you for the help!
---
Of course man, I hope something works out for you 🤙🏻
---
I think you got some sarcasm on my shirt. If you don’t mind wiping it off please.
---
I know he’s complaining about a broader level of neglect for about half the game’s weapons (pistols, large exploding, laser and energy, assault and radium rifles, and lets never mention the gamma gun ever again). 
---
And I agree with it. 
---
What I don’t think though is that it’s a showstopper. 
---
Most weapon categories have practical ways to be meaningfully utilized. It means pick one weapon over another. Handmade and not Assault Rifle. 50 Cal or Gatling and not Minigun or LMG. Western revolver and not 44 or Single Action. 10mm SMG and not Tommygun. I can keep going. 
---
Some, like the plasma flamer above, come with cost (ammo guzzling, plus a weapon endurance management challenge, plus -100ER for not taking grounded) to bring to bear. Keep in mind it’s basically a short range only explosive minigun that, unlike the minigun, is proximity safe. And that’s just too high maintenance for many players. 
---
But the point is, 
---
a. I’d agree there shouldn’t be “dud” weapons, that don’t go nowhere in any form. Like a gamma gun. Or the railway rifle in configurations where no damage perk applies. Or missile launchers. I agree with that view. 
---
b. One can also argue that all weapons should have an easy avenue - for casual players for example - to use. I’m not sure I agree. Bethesda has always excelled at simultaneously tailoring their games to both broad casual audiences and to the craziest of min-maxers. Here we have a new third category, which is basically CoD players who came to see what all the commotion was about, and their expectation is that a gun you stumble on + FPS skills should get you through the toughest fights. (They got that from TSE’s, three had it taken away from them, and they’re unhappy). But this is an RPG. And you need to work the mechanics to make the gun work. And you need to make painful compromises to be tall enough to take some rides. Finding the gun isn’t enough. You have to figure out how to work it. 
---
And I argue that having some weapons in the game that need clever ways, builds, mod and legendary combos and what not to drive, and work terribly if just picked up - that’s a welcome (and fun!) part of the game (for my tribe). 
---
From my experiences as an IT pro, this sounds to me like a duper logged into your server while you were fighting and f**ked the database up. This is all speculation of course, but I have been a SysAdmin and secondarily a SQL DBA for 20 years, and all of this looks really familiar. 
---
You can note that the days when servers would slowly degrade over a few minutes (caused by server side memory leaks) are gone now, pretty much the only things that happen are all sudden and catastrophic, things like server not responding that kicks you or getting nothing but spinning arrows. Sudden, catastrophic server issues are almost universally caused by runaway queries, like you would see when a user tries to do too much at one time. 
---
Pretty much the only way a user in this environment (where they can't make their own queries) can do that is to suddenly have way too many items for the database to track in a timely manner. Like someone with a million items in inventory being loaded into RAM (which will cause the server to crash if it runs out), or someone suddenly creating thousands of table entries in a time frame of a couple of seconds. Basically, the reason you're getting spinning arrows is because someone else is flooding the database with new entries beyond the planned capacities that the server is designed to handle, and your request is getting queued behind the dupers flood until it gets done.
---
In other words, dupers are BAD, m'kay? 
---
Is violence against robots really violence? Asking for a friend.
---
You will have to avoid main quests. All events. Basically logging on to the server.
---
I've found some quests that I can do by being stealthy, but I'm hoping folks know about some I don't.
---
You can buy it, but try adding it to your Power Armor Helmet and then equipping the helmet.
---
i have some perks that reduce chem weight
---
Ok, so I did a bit more testing, but I only had a few minutes so the data are limited. Looks like I was right up until the last step. The problem goes away when i either remove or change the problematic armor piece, but then comes back and won't go away again when i re-equip it again. I even tried logging out and back in between steps 2 &amp; 3 to no avail.
---
I can't remember quite what I did to make it go away before, but I know that at one point I had like 3 pieces unequipping each time and was able to fix it with this. Maybe I used another PA frame in the middle of it all...
---
On my personal todo list.  
---
I was officially asked by Bethesda Customer support to stop submitting tickets for today... lol
---
Good one, will add to the Weapons page when I make it.
---
When did I ever say I have a full set? I have 5 pieces, all different armor types and I don't have a chest piece. I have two right arms, a left arm, a left leg and a right leg. I'm online right now if you want to talk about it gt: dead mane walkn
---
we would just see endless trails of notes that say “penis” 
---
Yikes, that sucks. Maybe a temp solution could be to only allow it to be placed on the ground, like foundations. 🤔
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Are you on PC? I can come and help you.
---
Are you "Dropping" them with the "R"?  
---
That is like dropping an item from your inventory to "give it away"!  
---
Adding insult to injury if you have Atom paints on any of the pieces they will all be destroyed.

You have to "Deploy" the frame, not sure on console, but the left click or space bar on PC.

That's where the nuke exits the silo

I dont think they will release any for the excavator. Just my opinion though. (I hope they do) Why do you want to only use that one?

I experienced the same purple glow yesterday, but neither I nor my teammate use any mutations. I saw a third random player at Sutton Station with the same glow.

Who uses the word trolling anymore god this is cringy

Interesting. 🤔 Must tinker with this. I usually move the camp module inside somewhere but maybe not anymore...

Ahh shit is it ... Didn't know it actually did that! Thought it just dropped out of the sky haha best not hang around here too long then!
---
world full :( 
---
Oh lol. Yeah the more people that say it I assume it’ll get noticed more. Thank you!
---
aka 90% of the player-base.
---
I believe reddit FO76 rules prevent finger pointing at direct names. You may want to remove the names. They call it witch hunting. I don't know what the players could have done though to get you wanted. 
---
It's harmless.  You can stand on top of it when the nuke launches and you'll just slide off
---
Judging by the comments,  I am guessing a lot of players haven't experienced the joy of loading and finding certain elements of your base missing, including not being in storage. I have had to rebuild my water purifier three times because it just wasn't there anymore. Sometimes random items will appear in my storage as well- like 64 each of several crops; one time I got a random 5 medium power generators.
---
Now imagine you get on and your entire camp is no longer there- not just not at its location. In fact, the C.A.M.P. device is in place and it shows on your map. But everything you built is gone. That is the frustration I am reading from the op.
---
Same here.
---
Still have 2 mins
---
I think you can also just hit LT/L2 5 times to get it to 0 as well

You can request a refund of atoms. (Even if they were soley earned in game) I accidentally bought the starburst floor pattern and had my atoms back in about a day after submitting a ticket.

Going to DM you about this!

Haha! That's a shame. I think I deserve to be launched with it after making this mistake.

&gt;The lack of good rewards

This is really my only reason.

I have killed her twice since the nerf. If the group is people who are spec'd properly  it really isn't a problem.

The problem is with the reward (there isn't one).

It's all good.  They are kinda secluded, so stumbling across one can throw for a loop for sure.
---
Yeah, been informed. Gonna delete the post and pretend none of this ever happened haha
---
What console are you on?
---
Be quick before the mods see and laugh
---
With the air filters scrubbing the outside air so no hint of smells remains, the stench of my befouled excavator power armor diaper reminds me that I'm alive.
---
Yeh especially when you do show up and nothing gets dropped by her fat greedy arse.. took it all to her grave then dissapears 
---
Just use melee and PA.. it's easy mode in this game
---
One of the most heart punching scenes in FO76 has no holotape , no real need for context. The watchtower near Sutton if you go has a mound of dirt , a baby stroller. In blocks on the mound is spelled out My Angel , if you go up topside you will find a woman dead with a gun in her hand. The story tells itself of a young mother and child who survived the bombs dropping , only to end up losing her child to the fallout. Unable to cope she ended her own life ... christ. 
---
Mods on this sub reddit? Haha Now you're the one making me laugh :)
---
I’m using herbivore, speed demon, marsupial, and grounded. My farm gives me soups for days, I can run and bound ev n in PA. And energy weapons are trash so why not have extra energy resist for those god damned liberator bots
---
I guess your right this the true wasteland 
---
Are there higher level players near you? That sometimes brings the monster level higher 
---
&gt; does not work anymore.

Thanks for tagging me adam

[u/JuarnCarlos](https://www.reddit.com/user/JuarnCarlos) \- is this a recent change you've noticed to four leaf clover? I.e. was it working as intended before a particular patch?
---
It ended up working for me although I had to relog like 5 more times haha. Appreciate the offer though! 
---
Thanks for the testing!
---
Hell of a write up, cheers to you good sir.

I agree, I think they will flag you for specific tags. They've come down on ppl for way less *eyeroll*
---
Yay! Glad you got it.
---
Which one was that? I'm wondering if I managed to miss that one. 
---
Even bigger increments. Idk why I didnt try this. Nice. This is pretty helpful idk why it didnt catch on
---
Can I become Optimus prime
---
The Dev's made a critical mistake and rather than copying the items as new, and using the "clone" items as a basis for new things about to be Added to the AtomStore, the edited, by mistake the core existing assets.  
---
Huge no-no, and usually would be caught in a couple different stages of QA, but bad luck this time.
---
Its real. They exist. But, they are dev room leaks so I wouldn't fuck around and find out if I were you.
---
Yeah I think that was the other one I wanted. What platform you play on?
---
Fallout 76 CAMP building ASMR channel?
---
Xbox one
---
ACIxSasquatch
---
When crafting I have all the components needed to craft however it will still say I need mor materials. I’ve found that having just the right amount of material needed usually causes this. 
---
I don't think there was at the time of the issue, but after relogging a couple more times it ended up fixing it.
---
You got it!  
---
I traded for a Furious, Weight Reduced Railway Rifle and was soulcrushed to find it did, well "Slap Damage" to supermutants...  
---
BTW Did you notice no perks seems to reduce the weight of the RailWay Spikes?
---
Hey VaultBoyUSA, can understand where you're coming from on this. Going to share your thread with the dev team.
---
This game isn't all that bad tbh it's fun to play
---
What platform?
---
The "radiation" signs should have been enough of a giveaway to me! Its 4:30am though so I'm allowing myself this brain fart.
---
I wonder if its related to these
---
&gt;!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpaeXWoxihk!&lt;
---
I'm pretty sure this is close to the issue. I shoot down and steal every crate I see. I've only become wanted 2 times from stealing nuke cards and each time was when the crate landed ontop of artisans row at white springs and a Player CAMP on the golf course had turrets with line of sight on me.
---
I got 17 corn last night so it’s definitely back. It’s irritating because I doubt anyone is doing it on purpose. Hell, I don’t even know how to recreate it 
---
Yes same!
---
Nerd rage, bloody mess?
---
Don't joke like this, it might happen D:
---
Yes, this is a recent change. Before the Jan. 29th patch, it was working as it was seemingly intended. 
---
Not fixed on the last hotfix that resolved the bobby pin weight, bulk item scrap, etc. issues. I have not checked since that hot fix.
---
The crossbow is affected by rifle perks though. It looks like they just forgot about it

&gt;Energy and Heavy Weapons Improvements. **We've heard and share your feedback that energy weapons** need to be brought inline with other weapon types. **We're also looking to adjust laser weapon durability** in a future update. Additionally, after recent balance changes related to Perks and Legendary Mods, players have expressed that explosive non-legendary weapons are now less powerful. We agree there are improvements we can make. **We’re doing an audit of heavy weapons damage and their ammo weights. We plan to increase damage in light of the perk and mod reductions, and plan to reduce ammo weight to make heavy weapons generally more viable**. These adjustments will roll those out in a future update.
---
The lines in bold are important to me and apparently you as well. I believe, like this commentor pointed out, that they really mean durability for energy weapons in the first couple sentences, and the "adjust laser weapon durability" is just a bit of a typo.
---
*However*, notice that the latter bold specifically mentions heavy weapons and specifically *doesn't* mention durability. They specifically said that the parameters they are looking at is ammo weight and damage. Damage, yay! With how DR works, it is either this or armor pen that needs a tweak to make the damage viable. But ammo? All it takes is two points in STR (Bandolier) and your ballistic ammo weighs next to nothing. The fact that they think *this* parameter is worth looking at, but not specifically mentioning durability, has me worried just as much as you.
---
Will definitely pass it on cashiimo. Thank you!
---
For sure, glad to help. Thank you for all the work you are doing! I like doing this sort if thing on my own. Basically my goal in most games is to try to do things I'm not supposed to be able to, haha. But if you need any more help testing anything on console, my ID is Mutard on PS4. :)
---
Also, I'll try to update this whenever I figure out what I did previously to fix it.

You can always collect pumpkins for the pumpkin house! That's all I got off the top of my head

same happened to me this morning on xb1
---
Yep medic wing also
---
Sent you a PM. Thanks ManDingo
---
Yes. Think it's a good time to become a Wasteland greeter. Have all necessary costumes. Clown costume and hat, skeleton costume and mask, ritual gear, and Fasnacht mask. Looking forward to picking up the grimy mascot costume soon. Unsure what it's name is off hand. Great idea OP. Grab extra recipes, plans, a bite of food and drink, ammo and low level weapons. Scare em first, then the gift of a care package. 😂
---
Look, I’ve had Dysentery for years now, and it’s made me an alcoholic. But when people say it’s all because of my condition, it really angers me, because they don’t know the whole story, yes My condition may have pushed me in this direction, but I think I would of gone down this road anyway. (Also, DONT sleep with a ghoul!)
---
I've mentioned this several times. YES PLEASE!
---
Happens to me too with all mutations. Healing factor can get annoying when you don't realize your health didn't refill after your previous battle.
---
Yeah, nothing. I’m kinda ok with it since I have hella stash space. I just got my second acc to level 50 and chose all the cards I wanted for my Railway raider build I call it😂 and realized none of the affects were doing anything and it was a huge disappointment. I’m working on a whole sniper build with my (possibly gonna prime it) anti armor, +50% limb damage railway
---
No.

My speed demon doesnt work a lot

Polito/SHODAN!

You can reverse a credit card payment up to 6 months after using it.  Might not be your best bet, though.
---
What quest?
---
Are you sending this comment from 2 weeks in the future?
---
Thanks for the good fight.
---
Ver'nice, mon.
---
My post wasnt aimed at you, just general observations that many people dont use out there. Most rifle or heavy builds dont have +10 int. So having both gun smith and demolition expert active is not possible... If you have a handmade TSE you have to take gunsmith or it will break in 3-4 minutes.. and the PA thing . It's a real issue man .. ppl do it in hazmat suits .. they are so focused on ground critters they contribute nothin to the fight.
---
What if it was a welcome mat but it clipped to the outside of the build ring, instead of inside the ring anywhere you want.
---
The nerf hasn't caused any real problems with the queen that I can see. But I got fed up with the garbage drops.
---
After you're done at the Morgantown Airport the next part of the main quest is actualy the AVR Medical Center in Charleston where you need to find out about the cure the Responders were working on. Once you've been innoculated with the cure you're then instructed to go to the Firebreathers at the Charleston Fire Department.
---
Hold back/select to make pipboy overlay
---
Will make the screen transparent and yellow instead of solid and green
---
It’s a work around, sorry, can’t fix your stealth woes
---
Hell even if just people start coming to Appalachia because they've been seeing nukes I'd be fine. The brotherhood could come in and try and make sure everything is under control. This could bring citizens which then brings raiders. I'm not gonna lie if I'm over in the capital wasteland seeing nukes going off in the distance I'm sure some people would come over to see what's going on. 
---
There was a lot of this, today.  Cleared out the golf club at the Whitespring a few times after a nuke, lots of spinning circles...
---
You know that Reddit isn't Bethesda's customer service department, right?
---
Yea, i've already been there. I'll check it out again.
---
yep
---
That wasn't true when I crafted it. Same identical stats as a normal hunting rifle. It just has some mods (like the recon scope) already attached. 
---
Thank you for letting me know. Sharing that info with the team now
---
This is good to know for when I'm trying to be stealthed thanks.
---
I killed my first scorch queen and got NOTHING. 
---
Again, Martial Artist. Not to mention the minigun one shots low level mobs when the game doesn't bug out.
---
Much better rewards elsewhere.  Someone nuked Morgantown last night, I'll be selling Flux for days.
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
You got a link to that? My ctrl+F and I couldn't find any mention of future updates other than the mention that Survival mode will be launching sometime in March. 
---
Good luck being stealthy against the auto aim stealth boy breaking can fire through all materials scorchbeast queen lol. (no seriously good luck, I wanna know how it plays out) 
---
Choo choo 
---
Can't tell if my Speed Demon is working or not. I got a lever action with a speedy receiver so a reload is always fast, but I really want my jumping ability back. This is the first time I've had them not work for me.
---
I think that has been the plan from day -720.
---
:(
---
I need that sweet sweet acid! 
---
Nobody likes to read the 67th 15 entries terminal in this building.
---
There are a lot of mini stories in those, but none of these interesting, and none of them interactive in any way. Those would be ok on a book, but not a game.
---
&gt;There were two nukes on Vault Tec U.
---
Might be the one I went to.
---
How did anyone figure out how to do this in the first place? Seems a bit ridiculous. I've tried the silo twice now, got to the part protecting launch supervisors before giving up to exhaustion. If I'd made it to entering the code without seeing this post I would have smashed my TV. What the hell was Beth thinking? All those effing robots are bad enough.
---
I’m not so sure about that. I don’t know if it was related to this bug or not, but I was at Fort Defiance and kept hearing footsteps running around. Couldn’t see anything. Finally saw a red dot on my compass, hit VATS, and got the outline of a player... but there was literally nothing else. No Stealthboy shimmer or anything. The person was Wanted, so I took him down with VATS, and he became visible again as he died. 
---
I scraped everything my workshop has nothing built or stored

I love Nocturnal.  It is challenging in return for its buff.  Night hunting is different and interesting, as well as rp-ish.
---
Quad is a game changer on the right weapon: i wish i had it for my Dragon or harpoon.
---
Instigating is also a winner on the right weapon, e.g. fireaxe.  Knife, not so much.
---
In FO4 Two-shot dominated all other possibilities.  I am not surprised they nerfed it.  Even now, it is better than most of the others in almost any situation.
---
Yeah.  Upvote 
---
It took a couple tries searching for a possible solution, but I ran across this earlier this evening.
---

---
It's not a guaranteed fix, but it seems to help a lot for me so far (I'm using a Ryzen 2700x)
---
It’s a complete tank with sneak, I agree 100% ❤️
---
Grahm exists and is effectively immortal. All the robots are also effectively immortal. just for the record.
---
No joke, i was just about to post about this. I haven’t been able to access daily quests going on for about two weeks now. Specifically the ones in the Mire. Waste Not, Idle Explosives, Play Time, Queen of the Hunt, as well as the daily quests in Camden Park. I’ve checked terminals and spoken to quest givers and still nothing. I’ve been hoping for fix soon or at the very least an acknowledgment that they are aware of these bugs. 
---
Nobody reads tickets. If they did, there would be a shit ton of known bugs listed in Bethesda's known issues thread. It's practically bare, indicating they don't read bug reports at all.
---
I think we were always lucky because we never had many problems with previous Fallout titles. They would freeze on the rare occasion, but nothing gamebreaking all the time.
---
Now? FO76? How is it STILL a nonfunctioning game? Basic functions limp and the game only seems to run smoothly when you aren't actually grouped with anyone. It's like the game doesn't even want you to play.
---
I spent hours working on the quest chain for Rose to kill Yao Guai and make friends with Deathclaws only to lose my fucking progress when a friend joined and we helped him catch up to where we were. Now even when I'm not grouped, it still wants me to steal from a super mutant camp, but no marker shows up and I don't get credit for looting from the super mutant camp at the array anyhow. Watched both of my teammates complete theirs and mine remain brokenly bugged. I logged in and out multiple times, tracked and untracked the quest.
---
So I am not playing FO76 anymore. This game should've never been fucking released. I have had to fight this game just to fucking play it and I've fucking had it. It's a fucking disgrace. 
---
It’s also a blast to use at Whitesprings, it’s literally a room clearer 
---
I have a lot of problems with the game, but no one here complains about what I consider to be the game's most serious problems. 
---
People here are butt hurt about their duped weapons getting nerfed.  I was pissed for a long time about certain mods being determined by RNG. 
---
Some of that was fixed in the most recent patch, but other problems remain. 
---
I don't think a three star legendary enemy in Watoga should drop level 40 gear. And I don't think they should drop wooden armor. 
---
I think it's a serious problem that the games toughest boss villain drops garbage mods, armor and weapons. 
---
As killing her is a rare feat, she should drop rare (and valuable) items. 
---
She doesn't. 
---
Yeah, that was all kinds of horrifying.  
---
Similarly was the Responder that's locked in the fridge in Flatwoods who's recorded begging for help.   
---
There're a few junkies who died trying to fight off the addictions and of course Flatwoods itself was killed by a raider band who came looking for teh one girl .. Maggie? I'd have to check. Anyway, she was barely a teen when the bombs fell, watched her whole family get sick and die, and wound up diving DEEP into drugs to hide from the pain. Wandered up to the mountains and got sucked into a raider gang. Had no idea what she was doing save for teh few times the drug wore off, then she went a little crazy with realization until she could get high again ... wound up in Flatwoods and finally found HELP. Was working on getting clean. Was finally starting to face her survivor's guilt with other people who'd been through what she had, was gettingc lean, was putting things back in order ... then her old crew came looking for her and found Flatwoods. Figured it was a soft target full of supplies and attacked. I don't think anyone on either side survived. It's ... horrible. The leader of teh band wound up bleeding to death by teh Tinker's Bench in Flatwoods, but she left a taunting note in the funeral home before she died.  
---
Just ... so MANY stories, man. 
---
I need that bathrobe.
---
I want more endgame content.  Leveling to 50 was fun for me, but nukes happen to far between now. 
---
Mine have started having this issue. Marsupial not working, speed demon either. Theyre not being suppressed either. It's been happening on and off the past few days. 
---
This is such a strange mentality to have.
---
You know drops are 100% randomized.
---
Somebody could have gotten a full set of sentinel/assassin's within the span of their first 50 levels.
---
Alt account. 1 karma, really? This is getting pathetic.
---
Why str gives melee +5% dmg per point is beyond logic. Considering you can stack statas up to like 50 especially STR. That legit +200% damage boost. 
---
I reported that bug 3 months ago during Beta, along with several other Social bugs I experienced every session. They don't even list a single one of them in their Known Issues thread, which tells me they don't read any bug reports.
---
Did you have a pet?  I’ve heard there is a bug where the game saves space for dead pets. 
---
Np
---
Ad Victoriam, Brother.
---
Xbox1 controller tap lit xbox button, dpad right all way to settings, dpad down to audio, headset chat mixer slider 3/4 of whole. I think this setting makes everthing else quieter so you can hear others talking.
---
I just gave this a shot and it seems to have helped the problem considerably.  I still get freezes around Charleston occasionally, but it's been far less frequent.
---
For the record, I'm running a Ryzen 2700x, and when it does the occasional freeze, I notice my processor cores running the game to peak suddenly to 100% for several seconds before dropping back down to around 20-30% per core.  Just now just after I fast-traveled to the Charleston Train Station I had a bad freeze of 2-3 minutes.  Even the Radio stopped playing and I was about to force-close the game when it finally caught up.
---
Why not ride a radstag?

 &gt; Whoa. This is crazy

That was very Horror movie icon of you
---
Wow amazing 
---
Ambitious. Best wishes
---
That would definitely be worse than the current state of things. As things are it's annoying, but I can still mostly choose where I will land. Like that, I would *only* be able to appear outside the building.
---
Gonna go ahead and share this one with the team!
---
Hmm. That’s weird. I did Queen of the Hunt today so it can’t be a bug for everyone. I was referring to the actual daily events such as “Monster Mash” and “Breach and Clear.” Either way, I really hope they fix both daily events and quests (in your case) next update.
---
Not sure why Tesla Coils are Tier 5, they're not particularly useful like reactive plates.
---
They can also make you enemies really easily of the robots at the Whitespring.
---
Nice dude!
---
I noticed it as well, I got so sick of killing enemies and waiting 5min for a chance at loot that I logged. Don't plan on spending more time waiting for loot than actually playing. 
---
I do enjoy reading. I'm always reading any terminal entries or notes I find laying around, but I'm usually pretty disappointed. For example, I was so excited to venture out and explore the crashed space station - to see how space technology could have been fused into the Fallout world.
---
What did I find in that entire area? A single piece of paper, with an inventory log and a key code. 
---
An entire space station crash site, absolutely wasted.
---
Hmm strange. Do you know if this occurred after the last patch or the hotfix?
---
Ohhh gotcha, I must’ve missed that. On the flip side, I completed Breach and Clear yesterday and saw it pop up again today. I guess it’s just awful luck, here’s hoping it gets fixed for the both of us 
---
I did have a pet but it loaded now and it’s still just saying 50% stored tho nothing is stored, no pet
---
Great one for new players.
---
There was an article, ages ago, "Secrets of Seyda Neen," detailing all the stuff you could get at the first town in Morrowind.
---
Could really use one of these for Flatwoods.  Flatwoods has so much a 1-20 level could routinely use.
---
Screenshot of alien or it doesn't exist. People hate vague posts, and people will especially hate being sent on a goose chase for no reason.
---
Have you actually played for 24 hours? I'm really interested in knowing if the vault starts killing you if you refuse to leave
---
Meat hook benefits from Unarmed and One-handed damage, apparently. This gives it the highest unarmed damage potential. 
---
Agreed
---
Same. Ugh. I'd love to hear a fix for this..
---
Are we writing the next big musical about a game company that devises a scheme to stay a float for eternity? 
---
On me...
---
Haha
---
Lol. I was going to ask if that hurt. 
---
this is correct
---
??
---
For sure. Good luck.
---
I imagine a fallout game built from the ground up to be what this game COULD have been. 
---
The thought gives me a resounding “fuck yeah that would be awesome!” In my head. 
---
But the obvious truth is that Bethesda has/had no intent in creating a quality GaaS looter shooter in the Fallout world. 
---
This was a cash grab with reused assets that gave a side dev team a way to be profitable while they improved their Developed their multiplayer dev tools. 
---
I think you are spot on, I do have it equipped and see it occasionally but I am at half health or more, and I have mainly noticed it when my friend and I are in an all out brawl and he is getting owned. 
---
I think its all a simulation, thats LIE someone inside is trying to warn us.
---
Do you have X01 calibrated shocks?
---
Agreed!  Love the name btw.  SAO is awesome!
---
I've used to talk to NPCs. Now i talk to my rad worms.
---
What platform you on I’ll give you mine I really don’t use it. 
---
I've heard the mutations that strike back thorns style can get you wanted even in passive mode.
---
Why do you need 'human' NPCs for that? Most human npcs in recent games are just as flat as a terminal. Even in fo4 there was sooo little choice that it wouldnt have mattered if they were advanced terminals (like the major robots) or robots.   
---
The problem with the story telling in this game is neither that humans are all dead nor that there are no humans to 'emphasize with'. It is that your actions are guaranteed to have no impact on the world by design. This is a multiplayer environment and thus any impact you have should be reflected on another screen. Add to that the constantly resetting servers and there you have it. i rather been told a story than having fake dialog i feel frustrated with.  
---
Factions could make things a bit more interesting, but there are already things in place (not spoiling it for you though)  and little need for new factions that would have no previous history outside the vault and would probably be pretty flat too.   
---
Middle of the map. Find it on your own like i did.
---
Probably the same guy who posted the first bullshit post.
---
please read the post
---
Karma dossent mean anything. Just like your assumption
---
What that mask
---
I didnt screen anything, he wanted it to be a mystery just let it be known i found it.
---
I’m seeing it on non-explosive weapons. Doesn’t seem to matter what gun too; it was happening with a Gatling gun, an automatic laser rifle, and a lever action,
---
Hatch is in water.
---
Hey mate, glad you found a resolution. Just to confirm though - we're definitely looking into the stealth issues
---
Secondary legendary prefixes, Powered/Poisoner and Tertiary prefixes Cavalier/Sentinel/Safe Cracker/Acrobat, generally only appear in the Item Name of few specific Primary legendary armor types, such as Bolstering/Vangaurd/Assasin. The underlying legendary effects can generate on any 2 and 3 star armor.
---
Nice, thank you.
---
The return of FISTO?
---
Gonna have to go find itself, like you know, its intended.
---
So yes? I read it but just wanted to make sure. I’d like to buy a pair but am communication banned on Xbox love. 
---
Live 
---
That kind of hurt. Truth hurts
---
Same here
---
Thanks, would help a bunch!  
---
You see, I do the same thing, and I keep saying Bethesda needs people like us doing they QA / balance testing..
---
When you don't have a large amount of lights and decorations, you can actually build a surprising amount of walls, floors, and roofs. 
---
Wow this game is so balanced now. 
---
Honestly. Im about to delete mine too im being spammed with PM's with offers for caps and weapons.
---
Blueprints have very little budget.  That's what I would have told them
---
read the last line
---
Middle of map.
---
Omg that's a brutal,'brutal railway rifle!  
---
You got it, but you better be wearing raider armor (I'm 317 still rocking my Raider PA!)  
---
Plan to start the Armor page tomorrow, followed by weapons (which is going to suck, because they are so unbalanced and broken)
---
Yeeeeeeeah
---
I understand the plans don’t exist but do you have the MOD itself for sale?
---
Derp.
---
Rather they add welcome mat spawn point
---
you are a very naive person, huh
---
Love it!
---
Next stop, my thighs.
---
I was actually serious. I'll read the rest of your post when I wake up.
---
same here
---
That's cool. I'm in my 90s as Well I have yet to get a good roll item. I haven't even seen a good rolled melee weapon (my build) I'm having to run around with all rise and wish I could find something better. Who knows maybe Bethesda will give us melee users some love.
---
i craft mods not buy mods. 
---
I gave Preston my roadworks.
---
That's what I did tell them, basically. Blueprints simply enable you to build it again if you have the materials- which is a little hard when you  already spent your material on the item that just vanished. 
---
Yeah lemme type a huge post making a game out of it then come here 4 hours later on an Alt that takes 48 hours to post on to say " i found it."  You're  smart.
---
Thank you for this!  I wasted far too much time server hopping trying to get that holotape to load.
---
Mods are like Fallout tradition. They fix things that are broken, sometimes add features Bethesda should have. There's a mod called Known Plans and Recipes. Bethesda added that feature recently. Save my stuff would not let items in your favorites list be scrapped or sold. The latest patch broke the mod. Using mods that are like cheats would be pushing it and I avoid them. But simple mods that menus easier to navigate or allows you enhance the games colors Are allowed and even have been encouraged by Bethesda. Mods are one of the thins that made all the previous Fallout games worth having. You could introduce a whole new story line with some of them.
---
Thanks then :) 
---
It’s actually a fairly constructive feedback thread, both OP and comments. Nice discussion. 
---
Did you wait till they called out your ticket number?
---
You can’t Nuke the customer complaints officer if you haven’t got your valid ticket 😂
---
Ultracite boots? You mean for power armour ? 
---
Raider vendor at the Top of the World. Not the train station. The other one.

You know it, I’ve been decking mine out with mods on. I really enjoyed starting fresh.  My whole perk set up and pa mods let me run like crazy fast for a while, pacify animals I come across to be silent, survive off of veggies, and snipe with my rr(if the perks work soon) 
---
Mainly doing it for the PvP mode coming up. What platform are you on? Maybe we could have a raider gang😂
---
&gt; Yeah lemme type a huge post making a game out of it then come here 4 hours later on an Alt that takes 48 hours to post on to say " i found it." You're smart.
---
I am indeed right, you getting bent outta shape over me saying that shows it. Or are you gonna put your money where your mouth is and post screenshots? You can’t, cause it’s fake.
---
Or the ability to merge two legendaries of the same weapon type to get a stronger or random different stat.  
---
Oh. My. God. 
---
I’m gonna have to do this all over again 😭😭😭
---
Lol no proof got it.
---
In this case maybe, but I've gotten wanted tags in a few cases where it was not warranted: #1 helping someone fend off a wave of mobs attacking their base.  The first time I did this, I must have slightly hit a wall or something and the game wrongly tagged me for trying to destroy his base.  As it turned out that person was grateful, but some other guy who was about 30+ levels over me killed me later.  Right now, same thing... I was doing SBQ and someone built a house that I must have slightly hit while we were fighting off 2-3 SBs and trash mobs.  Again, no real damage done--the house was fine, and no one in the group cared, but it's still there after I've logged on again today.  It's not the end of the world, but this is clearly not how the tag is supposed to be applied.
---
It took me 4 hours to do it. Im not going to spoon feed it to you. Go "play the game." Isnt that the purpose?
---
Hmm haven’t found that one. Any specific directions?
---
Yep as you go up the main round to the town. It’s at the far back right. Have to go inside the building up to the first floor then down the stairs. That’s where the vendor bot is. 
---
Text holds no emotion. Idk why you think im "bent out of shape." I could care less, i came here to post to the OP of the other post that i found it. I honestly dont care if you see zetans or not.
---
A hillariously bad idea across the board, I will explain with a bullet point list of the ways this would hurt the game
---
1.making any player take full damage all all times vs. an "immortal" player is beyond stupid unless you make it so the negative karma player does  full damage  to ALL(even pacifist) players(and gets caps for the kills to counter the amount of caps they will be losing as they are farmed for caps). you'd just be harming PvP
---
2.im level 250 on my main and I don't shy away from PvP even if it's just with friends, but with your bad idea I would allways be fully damageable because I mess around with friends when bored(everyone gets thier caps back if they want them it's generally a good time)
---
3. You honestly think I should lose 3x caps PER death when a level 50 player can do the same damage as me if they planned ahead, hell some do even better in PvP by making stealth riflemen.
---
Also going to term or two here
---
Griefers = raiders
---
Griefing = raiding 
---
Hell a raider killed thousands of people in fo76 because he wanted to build  there, if that doesn't sound like a player leveling a base to get the owner to move it or switch servers idk what does.
---
Many games have raider/bandit factions  players can iether join or mimic. Your playing a fallout game, raiders will abound. The only difference is instead of a crap ai, it's a player behind the controls.
---
To sum up my thoughts, another "great" idea with no thought into how it would effect the game or it's players.
---
Hey, at least the graphics are on par!
---
I remember once upon a time when I would say this game was going to be a disaster - everyone wanted to lynch me for it.  
---
Inside the building north of the station there’s a vendor in there. Not the top of the world building but the big one close by it.
---
Mini nukes wait for no bot.
---
Bugs fix. Less demanding I would think than creating new content. That and new content chances are will add more bugs so better to have squashed as many as you can first. 
---
I'm level 107 and I still run flatwoods daily. It has so many other resources, lead and steel, pretty much a little bit of all scrap, weapons, grenades, etc. 
---
Theres every work bench and a stash. It's not just a good place for new players, it works for all levels. 
---
Also found another first aid box on the third floor of the agricultural center so that's 24 total. 
---
You dropped this \\
---
Did you mutate into an Empath? It really makes you squidht
---
Came here to say this
---
Bug fixes. You need fix something first before you can make it better. 
---
PC....  
---
And if PVP expands past the twerp/tea bagging fest it is now I'm down, but until they fix some of the balance issues, especially with Assassin+Sentinel... No thank you.   
---
Had to report a dude today who was exploiting a PVP loophole, but after I didn't fall for his garbage I watched him taunt people into combat while wearing Excavator PA, then pop out quickly and stand there in regular armor and just destroy 3 people.  
---
That's just a mess IMHO 
---
Content. I made it this far with the bugs. If they are just going to keep breaking stuff, break something new.
---
They saved a lot of money by using a lot of terminals and notes. NPCs are much more complex to create and voice. It also costs a lot of time. Using robots is much more simple and they can excuse, that they only use one voice actor for that robot.
---
I'll believe it when I see it, the last 3 patches don't inspire allot confidence they understand balance, let alone the rest.
---
**Content.** While as a heavy main it sucks that just about ALL  heavy weapons are unusuable, I can make do with the rather excellent Gatling Gun for the time being. 
---
Yeah it’s a mess
---
How does this guy have enough budget to make that. I place my bed down and a plant and the whole budget is full
---
Do You Like Guacamole?!?
---
Sure it does, if you’re not a faker upset he got outed why even reply? You respond like a guilty party. Your whole reply here is excuses and deflections. You talk like a guy trying to talk his way out of being caught in a lie. And badly.
---
No proof, no truth, just a kid trying to be important. It’s sad. And in a sub filled with nonsense and tall tales and disinformation, it is something else too: unneeded.
---
Take a hike.
---
"Just because there's barely a story doesn't mean there's no story"
---
I think you're missing the point. The writing is terrible, the story isn't compelling, the presentation isnt grabbing. 
---
Most people won't invest themselves into the story. 
---
Rad worms is affecting mutations 
---
Whatever you have to tell yourself.
---
Ill hike back to the hatch then.
---
the account is three days old, OP is in it for the long-con 
---
That's really beside the point. If he built them, then they should be there when he returns. And they are not. It's a very serious problem, and it's one with the game design, not him. 
---
Considering i just told everyone in market chat how to find it kinda defeats your post but sure, lets go with that.
---
[this is ridiculous ](https://youtu.be/gKUol0DDNqw) 
---
Nothing changed. Some people have no idea how to play, others do. Level in this game doesnt matter since someone could have a 2nd character and just suit it up with overpowered gear once they hit level 50. Same goes for high level players, some people farmed whitesprings when they offered 700 exp per kill and could have mediocre gear. 
---
&gt; There's a reason pretty much every shooter ever made makes a simple melee bash/punch/knife a one hit kill
---
Name one that also has massively bullet sponge-y enemies to the degree of this game. Also most other shooters don't wait until players are already pretty close for the enemies to spawn in.
---
Why not both?
---
The content has already been developed or is well on its way. The fixes are pretty clear, hell our modder community has already told them how to fix a large amount of the issues. 
---
Bethesda needs to step up. It was their decision to release a half baked game, they need to own that and make it right. I want new content and bug fixes. 
---
I fully expect new content will mean new bugs, that’s fine. But for gods sake give me something else to do than hop servers for plans and lead. 
---
The video would likely break the witch-hunting rule.
---
Can I cop an invite? 
---
&gt; Since a level 190 doesn't necessarily have any more hit points than a level 20, that makes it a threat at all levels.
---
A level 20 doesn't necessarily have any less hitpoints? Who do you think is more likely to have higher End? The one that's not even halfway to the SPECIAL cap or the one that's already past it?
---
They degraded the demo perk so it wasn't on obligatory part of builds but the only way to run a Gatling plasma is to max both gunsmith and luck of the draw.  Which is also reputedly bugged! 
---
It is buggy but a lot of fun nonetheless, in my opinion.  
---
Bug fixes!!
---
For new players and for those of us with a life, it would be nice to not have the game crap out and ruin the progress that we make in the limited playing time available.  Plus, there are a lot of players sitting on the sidelines not buying the game because of the poor reviews due to bugs.  In other words, if they want to grow the game, get it fixed first.
---
I think we are all aware this game has issues right? I was trying to help him find a way around the issue.
---
I never said it was him. I was just asking questions to figure out more information as to why it is happening. Also my friend used to have this issue and it was because he had 5 turrets. Now he has 2 turrets and they dont disappear. Do with that as you will. 
---
Is it so bad to try and help someone work around the bugs? 
---
What platform are you on? If ps4 I could show you 
---
There has to be a downside to heavies, I'm fine if they choose durability. But an upside will be nice =) 
---
Xbox.  Thanks though. 
---
Sure it’s balanced—you can one-hit-kill but you are also one-hit-killed.   
---
Iam enjoying the game very much :) still got loads to do, taking my time exploring etc.
---
I dont get to play very often so i when i do, its really fun. Bugs or not
---
What but I’m a fruitarian IRL I just want a fruitarian mutation that lets me eat raw fruit and weaponize melons.
---
I didn't see any hacking or cheating. Maybe tell us what time in the video it happened at.
---
As one who has launched quite a few nukes, I can say that  number of enemies in silos has been incredibly inconsistent. 
---
There's times when I have hacked the terminal to turn off the turrets, only to see the option isn't there- because the turrets aren't there. 
---
Other times, there is a huge laser barrage from the turrets that will melt you in seconds if you are not careful.
---
Sometimes there's a ridiculously huge horde of robots, and other times the number of robots seems pretty lite and easily dealt with. 
---
None of this seems influenced by which silo you choose. 
---
That's just been my experience. 
---
If you enjoy the style of fallout 4 then you’ll like 76. It plays a lot the same and it seems to use a lot of the same models of certain objects with also new ones. A lot of the bad reviews are from people who just don’t like it being online. It’s not a bad game and a good amount of the time you don’t see other players and except for the occasional asshole they’re usually docile. And the nukes aren’t a problem. You’ll never see “swagdaddy69” has launched a nuke right at you or really anyone but themselves to harvest. It takes some time to get into but it’s also a really good game especially if you like fallout 4
---
TL/DR: if you like fallout 4 and don’t mind the occasional player then get it. 
---
Also GameStop has 7 day returns
---
It takes time to make edits to a model, and I guess their 3D environment team is busy working on other things that are higher priority
---
Wastelanders: The Brotherhood of Steel is not customer service.
---
I ran into it once in the more, and shot it once, and it disappeared.   A vengeful Lothian has been at my base 4 times since.
---
It was happening to me before the hotfix
---
Just read the looking for groups posts on Xbox live.  I’ve seen people offering to dupe items for caps.
---
Yeah, I had rad worms when I noticed that my marsupial jump wasn't working.
---
Long story short, if you have a disease causing problems with a mutation, there will be a delay after you cure it before you're back to normal.
---
The plan is called "modern cloth chairs". I'm not sure of the exact location but I know I bought it from a vendor vs found in the wild. 
---
Looks like your teammate needs to put pacifist mode on.
---
Let me guess, you don't dvdn own the game because if you did you knew that numbers of players on the map is not an issue due to being a survival where you compete for resources.
---
You dont know when it was duped tho
---
That was with pacifist mode on. 
---
Hmmm ive never seen that
---
Nope. Your teammate must be hitting them.
---
What, I have literally found 3 in all of my play time
---
&gt; Not a lot of players
---
But that's a good thing. The less people that show up the less her armor and health gets inflated.
---
Wait till they release new content and normalize weapon damage. Right now we have no idea what they are thinking. Melee is the new hotness but we all expect it to be the next big nerf. 
---
If you enjoy monotony and farming the same crap over and over to do the same thing you did yesterday then by all means, hop in now and wait for them to nerf your spec so you can spend another 30 levels getting points to get to the point that you can try they next spec that will probably be nerfed once too many jump on it. 
---
I love the fallout world and the game has promise, but until Bethesda figures out what they want it to be, I feel like it’s an endless game of whack a mole. 
---
My hope is a year from now they will have learned enough to really make this game an amazing experience, but we’re a long way off currently. 
---
I hadn't considered this in my knee-jerk demand for a video, and you're not wrong.
---
Keep fighting the good fight!! I would add a TL;DR though:
---
'Game needs some fixin' :D
---
Seriously, praise was to Todd in the past. Bless you for keeping the fire alive!!
---
I haven't seen any there since the patch, despite looking there a few times now. Considering vendor inventory is no longer randomly generated per server I'm guessing they're no longer sold there. If that's the case I'd love to know where they now are too.
---
I am positive it was on for all of us. Watch the second video I posted, it shows it best.
---
I do own the game. Over 650 hours played. Two character, 1 lvl191 and another lvl55. Once you have played as much as me, competeing for resources is no longer what you do. Its farming legendary gear/weapons/caps and killing/griefing other players since there is nothing to do.
---
With higher server populations there would be more to do for end-game players who are interested in pvp. Yes pvp was confirmed in March but if its 24 player servers still then there literally no point. I may as well go play Elder Scrolls Online and pvp in Cryodill on my Nightblade with some friends. 
---
I logged on once and told my camp couldn't be placed because someone was in my spot. 
---
I swapped servers and my camp was just gone. Nothing in storage. Just gone. 
---
So, rather than coming here to complain, I just rebuilt it, mats and all. 
---
That is helpful, since for some reason they don’t think we would want to see what the plans we are buying actually build! Thank you, I’ve been looking for a resource like this!
---
Seriously,  this is supposed to be part of the next chapter right?  Meaning the scorch plague is defeated with the death of the queen (story wise).  Perfect time to add actual NPCs.
---
People put points in endurance?
---
Only the pipe bolt action and pipe revolver with rifle stocks benefit from both sets of perks. The pipe rifle (semi-auto) does not.
---
Hahaha TL:DR...   
---
At this time I don't know if it's love or spite, but I'm going to drown them in tickets until we get stuff fix!
---
I watched both videos in full. Don't team up with other people then it won't happen.
---
Someone at Bethesda had to write that like either as a punishment or for fun 
---
I had the same problem happen.  I was mutated and had a lot of radiation to the point of being sick, was about to remove it when they attacked me.  I thought that maybe it tripped something in their targeting settings.
---
Also, I thought that I read somewhere that if a Windigo is in the area, it can turn the robots against you.  but maybe I'm remembering this wrong.
---
What's your point? I've one shot players using a crafted combat rifle.
---
&gt;The de equipping power armor pieces i happens every time I respawned  and was in armor or when I get out and back in
---
I also get it whenever I fast travel. Always the same pieces, too. =/
---
I haven’t put a single point into charisma, just feels useless to me
---
No problem
---
 It isnt my work. Im.not sure who did it but they're a saint. 
---
It really is ridiculous that the plans dont tell you what you're getting, even armor mods dont tell you what the effects are. Very poorly done. 
---
I have a perk that lets me search for chems, I usually get them that way. But even still, I have found at least a dozen without that perk. 
---
Yeah. This is a great idea.
---
The vault doors open and flood the world with human NPCs. Some can be traders or factions. My only concern is that I have seen Wooby or whatever his name is in the development room. He didn't seem finished, not polished. He looked like they thought about adding him but gave up. 
---
Sigh. Sounds like just one more  de-motivator for fighting the queen. 
---
Crap like this is why I  have decided to stop bothering with the queen.   
---
She drops plans that I already have and shitty wooden legendary armor.   In over 20 kills (I lost count after that), the one set of plans that I needed from her she has never once dropped, not for myself nor anyone in any of my teams.
---
I don't need more explosive vents or bloody knuckles plans.  I don't  need plans for a power armor suit that I already have. 
---
Is this really a hard thing to do? I've played a shit load of online games and this just seems stupid. 
---
Heavy weapons SHOULD DO more damage. You don't need to mitigate that damage you need to mitigate the defenses of having a heavy weapons build. A heavy weapons dude should need more defenses to support them.
---
I know we aren't calling this a true MMO, but classically the heavy hitters have the worst defense. If you are going to buff some legendaries with the +240 damage resist while reloading have that buff be meaningful.
---
 TL;DR: Increase heavy weapons damage and decrease the defenses of the player.
---
Why is this trending 
---
You must have been watching with your eyes closed. Btw that white hit market means pacifist mode is on. Watch closer. 
---
OP is clearly a duper. How else did they accumulate caps that fast seeing how we have a daily cap limit AND a personal cap limit. I call fubar.
---
I love it! 
---
Yeah but the western revolver is the same model as the .44.
---
Don't bother with it. Tried playing it with friends for a week. Got to the 20's, but the bugs made it a constant struggle to even play the game.
---
It's sad too, because some of the stories you follow are beautifully sad. 
---
Doesn't matter if you have pacifist mode on. That doesn't stop them from killing you if your teammate hit them.
---
Riverside Manor. Go into your data on the pip boy and go to side quests and make sure you are tracking Into The Mystery.
---
I call mines Jezebel. Motivates me to eradicate them when they appear.
---
Yup that had to be it
---
You're kidding. I am lv31 and I have craploads of Legendaries.
---
My eyes were open. One of your team mates turned pacifist mode OFF. You turned yours OFF too. You guys got wrecked, that's all.
---
I think you need to read the patch notes from the late update, it sure does mean I do not take damage, and I definitely should never take fatal damage until I engage them. No offense, but do you play fo76 ar all?
---
Not to be mean or anything. Sorry if I did sound mean there, just a bit surprised.
---
It fixed one offense but left the other one nerfed...   Of course, it fixed the right offense...  (grin)
---
Since day 1, yes
---
Haha. I just watched you, level 170 "playing". Don't ask me if I play. You are clueless.
---
Im not even claiming to have a lot of caps??
---
I only turned mine off for the dev's. Shows what cheats they used.
---
All red and bright power armor headlamps seem to be affected by this 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alaxcz/my_x01s_bright_headlamp_is_now_being_tagged_as_an/
---
I assume you play solo? Really awesome in groups!
---
As long as you think of it as an Early Access game, sure, go for it.
---
I'd nuke for flux. That is all. Nuking the fissure site is bad. I can't kill her and materials for flux are too spread out. Whitesprings is the only logical place. More enemies for fluids and hardened masses and more flowers.
---
And the pathetic nature shows through. Btw that fatman i hit him with did 900+ damage...
---
You lose caps if you die to another player?
---
I can vouch for Redbeard here. I HAVE the Tricentennial Edition. This is not the same thing.
---
That makes zero sense... 
---
Same here, there are several plans like pocketed trapper armor arms that are not marked as known despite me knowing them already 
---
Marine tactical helmets
---
I'm guessing you're talking generally? Both my characters are 60+ and similar build as what you say for the sniper. Melee is just more effective at this point.
---
You can report! Go to the Bethesda website, log in, go to their Support page and select Fallout 76 as your game. There’s an option to select your platform and report players, and you can attach screenshots. 
---
I had this happen too, they were those little Chinese robots on 3 legs. I forget what they are called
---
I know that there was a bug for some plans at Harper's Ferry where the name did not match the actual plan.  Don't know if it was fixed or not.  Perhaps this is what happened.
---
I take over high profile workshops that either have a good location for teleports or top tier resource collection. Sometimes they're owned and need to be liberated and sometimes people try to take them over purely because they're itching for a fight.
---
Case in point, I took a workshop by my house from a lower level. I wasn't going to hurt him but he showed up in power armor and started firing. I cap him and go about setting the place up. He comes back two minutes later on his lvl 250+ with a pre nerf TSE spitting mad. Sometimes pvp comes looking for you anyway.
---
Xanax and liquor is an effective permanent solution for depression.
---
Thanks for that, as hard as I try, it's hard to keep track of them all.
---
what does it matter... my tse western used to do 760+ dmg pre-patch. now its 205+  everything sucks now except melee. they broke the game by nerfing instead of buffing/patching. I want gold skin for ALL melee/punching weapons lol
---
Hard choice. I think I'd have to say content, as the keep breaking their bug fixes, so at least we get *something* this way.
---
One of the white springs vendors inside the hotel sells all the modern plans:-) 
---
My own turrets in workshops turn red against me and attack me lol.
---
&gt;Is it so bad to try and help someone work around the bugs?
---
No, I see your point. I'm just a little fed up with having to find workarounds for problems that Bethesda should be fixing. 
---
It doesn't help that Bethesda has a long history of this sort of thing, where these types of problems appear, Bethesda is made aware of them and they do nothing, so they have to be addressed by modders and workarounds.   
---
They have gotten away with this stuff for too long.
---
Okay enough ranting though. Your workaround is probably the best bet. 
---
What vendor?
---
Yeah it’s been a long time since my armor or guns have repaired themselves with those luck perks
---
Ohhhh, so the pipe .308 and the pipe .45, right? 
---
I’ve totally check there, but maybe it’s time for another trip. Those robits really know how to hold a grudge, hopefully the heat has died down. 
---
1. Xbox One
---
2. crazymoe303
---
4. Stash box weight is glitched above max and cannot store anything else, removing items from stash does not fix it. (Have not done any weight glitches).
---
I’m really hoping for more serial killers in this game lol. 
---
Like people in costumes. Not killing hordes with Ted Bundy. 
---
Certain weapons and armour can't be modded, only fixed.  So, when fully fixed, it disappears.  that's why...
---
If Goat Simulator has Bicycles than Fallout 76 should. But, then again Goat Simulator is less buggy. 
---
Best spot to see it is around 0:52 into the video, that's just after one of my team mates died while having pacifist mode on. I ran over to test it, and see if they could drop me as well, and as you can see I do not engage them, their names stayed pacive, and they dropped me without me engaging. 
---
“Thomas has seen everything and it was time to go”
---
It also does not work on the Grognaks axe. It only repairs it to 100% max
---
you mean like what Square enix did with Final Fantasy 14?
---
I'm just tired of seeing every thread say the say shit. 
---
I like the game bugs and all. It's a lot of fun. I have 200 hours and have moved my camp 3 times. Instead of telling people there are bugs I'd rather just help them work around it. Yeah Bethesda should fix this. But this is what we have so I'll make it what I can. Who knows maybe they'll fix the game maybe they wont. It's not stopping me from playing. 
---
Did you fight the SBQ?
---
So, I have a lvl 50 1 star 2 shot pipe bolt action that I use as my sniper. Rifle vs. Pistol doesn't really matter as far as dmg and range goes.   It does more damage than anything else I have even with the nerf to TS and speed isn't all that important when sniping.  
---
If I'm to understand; I could use all the rifleman and gunslinger perks?  It does 112 damage with zero of these perks; guess I'm gonna have to try this out.
---
The division 2 is coming out next. 
---
How do you survive the nuclear fallout? I honestly don’t understand how I can find 10 people in the radiation but I can’t last 30 seconds, I’m level 20 btw so maybe I’m missing armor or something
---
.308 and .45
---
You really are a dumbass
---
Golf outfits and golf skirts are also pretty profitable. They're not worth as much as ranger uniforms, but you can grab 10 or more by making a pass around the outer buildings Whitesprings.
---
When I send videos to the dev's I want them to have as much info as I can provide. Hitter that guy with a fatman, and him surviving it helps them see how bad it was. Btw this thread was intended for people to post other cheater videos to, not for you guys to figure it out for the dev's. 
---
I have this happen a lot. The "best" way to trigger the bug is to spam the crouch button repeatedly to constantly trigger the Chameleon effect proc. After awhile it will just stay on, regardless of if you stand or start moving. 
---
I fix this by retriggering the proc and standing back up again. Doing this slowly will return me to a normal status 100% of the time.
---
It's a bug though so I won't guarantee this works for everyone. Just sharing my experience with it.
---
The trick is to move your new camp area far enough away from the last that it doesn’t overlap. Then it will charge you the right amount of caps instead of the 110
---
While i know he didnt mean it like this, that version of the swastika is actually a sign for good luck. So not only is this person ignorant and crude, but they are also unable to even do that correctly.
---
It does but no one was within a very large distant to me and I was pretty much back with my loot within no time. 
---
As well I mean I got a level 110 alt but I didn't realise this was a thing lol
---
Seriously.   In any other MMO once players broke a certain level their gearing didn’t matter.
---
Now,  combining the nerfs with the SBQ’s “I get more health the more of you there are” bullshit it’s just a massive resource sink with payoff that’s honestly a joke.
---
You must actively listen to the holotape from the headmistress' office for the quest marker to appear even though the location has been alluded to by now from other sources. If I've understood correctly your problem then this could be a fix?
---
General advice finding the spot:
---
Approach Seneca rocks from the south side to avoid a big drop (without power armour, with is fine) or have a long walk around. The spot is a little off the path to the left on a cliff overhang kind of spot. 
---
You are so Liberal!
---
Lol that is great 
---
I can't believe that anyone would take this seriously :D
---
Nice one.
---
You don't have to engage when you're teamed up with others who engage. Have you never played the game before?
---
How did you get killed if you never hit back? You take damage?
---
It's so funny that people still think this game will be fixed by the likes of Bethesda. ROLF. Never gonna happen people, never.
---
But when the game crashes while you are at a non nuked whitsprings,  and then you jump back in it will sometimes load you into a nuked whitesprings.
---
I think you're just trolling at this point... pretending you don't understand the PvP mechanics in order to make the game look worse than it is.
---
I just started playing recently and this is very helpful thank you.
---
Where’s the typo?
---
:/
---
Did you see their names go red in that video? Have you ever played before?
---
If they add human NPC’s I just might be sad I got perma-banned.
---
Hey, that's my windmill. I made a farm there for new players.
---
How do you pacify that which is already passive? 
---
Yesterday and today have been exceptionally bad for me. Before then, i would rarely have a slightly longer loading circle when looting bodies, but yesterday and today had bodies take 60+sec to load the loot on multiple occasions. Had my buddy waiting for me because his loaded instantly, only to have the roles reversed 5 mins later and i now had to wait on his loot to load lol. 
---
Mine was a TSE dragon, similar experience. Just watching super mutant warlords, fog crawlers, glowing deathclaws, and even scorchbeasts eat dirt from a well aimed shot was quite something

Hi, I'm nobody, and I enjoyed reading all those terminal entries, scraps of paper and finding all those audiologs, and found them compelling enough to continue playing through FO76 to experience them all.
---
Doesn't mean I can't understand how others like you dislike staring at so much plot through a terminal screen all day though.
---
I believe executioner's is something like +50% damage when they are below 40% hp
---
It's to try and entice an impulse buy. 
---
I think I did it, but I’ll go back to be sure.  What’s the Holotape name? I have so many of the Order ones.  
---
Living breathing? You mean pixels you can jerk off too. Quit acting like the game is hedged on NPCs . NPCs aren't essential to online games. Plenty of MMOs exist where NPCs are quest givers or vendors. Oh.. wait 76 has that already. Why do you need someone to run around with when their are other people? Oh, you can't communicate? Go play fallout 4 or wow and be the hero of the realm. Christ .. 
---
/a

---
After all that's happened (especially being mad at them) I have faith in them. 
---
Good to know someone likes them. I went through the whole game and the number of times we went through a building thinking: “there has to be something cool at the top” is too damn high.
---
I saw stories on these buildings, but while we know itd be unrealistic, fighting hordes of super mutants and turrets for a terminal entry saying how the company is bad. Feels bad.
---
I think it should be a chance to combine legendary effects of 2 of the same type of weapons. Weapon is destroyed if you fail to combine. 
---
There's no hockey mask, is there? There were ones in 3/NV. Not sure about 4.
---
There’s explosive resistance mods, and damage reduction mods on power armor.
---
If you’re in a team with someone attacking, you’re flagged even if you don’t attack.
---
Even if, there’s builds that damage thru the pacifist block.  But we all saw u turned it off. 
---
Depends on what platform. If you have a PS4 Pro or whatever the Xbox equivalent is called, yes. Otherwise, it'll be a bit rough
---
I can’t tell if these upvotes are serious ironic or satirical 
---
Why must you scare my residents?
---
Levels of irony which I just don’t get?
---
i want them to add legendary chainsaws to the mix. 
---
The overseer isn't dead, or her body would be near a specific tape.
---
real men have sludge lung
---
Why would a lack of endgame content explain a mass of players who have quit out of boredom before level 30?
---
Wait there's chainsaws?
---
Melee with mutations is wildly entertaining and deadly.
---
Higher level turrets always have had explosive/incendiary bullets
---
I experience barely any bugs, and those I do I easily bypass them either thru relogging, or just deal w/ it b/c it’s not game changing.
---
Maybe b/c I don’t use power armor I experience less bugs.
---
I want more content, so bored. And friends i’ve made are moving on to other games

"The swastika (as a character 卐 or 卍) is a geometrical figure and an ancient religious icon in the cultures of Eurasia, used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in Indian religions. In the Western world, it was a symbol of auspiciousness and good luck until the 1930s, when it became a feature of Nazi Symbolism as an emblem of Aryan race identity and, as a result, was stigmatized by association with ideas of racism and antisemitism."
---
I have faith that they can make this into an amazing game as well. I do think Zenimax (Especially the devs that are maintaining ESO) should step in and help them. The latest patch, and somehow an old build of the game getting pushed out as a stable build shows their lack of experience on working on a project like this. Don't get me wrong. I love 76, but the reoccuring issues with the bugs, and their seemingly PvP focus on things right now is simply.. Not what is ideal for the game. People are getting bored with little talk of more PvE content on the way, people have gotten bored and switched to greiefing, which is doing even more damage to the game at this point.
---
What did people think was going to happen in an online game where you can build simple shapes. I'm quite sure people are reacting as intended. And i'm betting it's intended to troll bethesdas management too, compelling them to take action against a simple arrangement of squares. Peoples hysteria about symbols is weird. I'm pretty sure arranging communist symbols with your camp would be far more cute.
---
U still in that server w/ him?
---
I give mine gattling lasers. Hella fun to see someone attack a big base. Especially at night or dusk. I go just to watch the light show. 
---
Doesn't seem like it.  I found the arms plan yesterday at Hornwright Estate,  not sure if it's a static drop. 
---
That would add excitement and interest back into legendary farming. It could be the same scrapping mechanics. You don’t unlock a hardened receiver every time you scrap a gun. Usually you get the best stuff after multiple scraps. Could be the same. The rarer adds take more guns to get that skill. 
---
You ever played before Mo? I don't think we have played enough to understand this "cheating" problem.
---
Do you guys read the patch notes ever? They blocked damage from being taken in pacifist noce on the last patch due to idiots like that, also the reason why they nerfed TSE. 
---
I don't see this as a big deal. Is he running around briefing players? Is he on his Mic, saying hate? Seriously? Sensitive much.
---
Psst. Read their username. 
---
This is common knowledge and sadly the majority of this sub refuse to listen, I've mentioned this time and time again that Maryland didn't make this game and it's Austins first full AAA game 
---
The masses just believe Bethesda is just one team and not a major publisher with multiple dev teams 
---
Sadly just like me you will probably get downvoted 
---
&gt;You can report! Go to the Bethesda website....
---
This would be a hilarious joke if it wasn't serious. This is such a shitshow. Massively mutliplayer online game.... no built in online game management functionality, no built in reporting, an abortion of a comm system, barely functional social...
---
And no way to easily report shitstains.
---
they shut down all but 1 terminal in each area. because of a duplication glitch. personally i think they should have the screens broken with bullet holes to indicate it is busted
---
Microsoft and Sony would first have to agree to allow it. All in game aspects going off of system friend list would have to be replaced with a new system. All 3 system builds would have to be compatible with one another. While it is technically possible, it's highly unlikely that Bethesda could get Microsoft and Sony to allow the crossplay, let alone whether Bethesda could handle making it work. 
---
Yeah, they saved. Aten\_Ra already helped me get a jury-rigged half solution to it, so I'm alright now. Now I have to find a way to get rid of the literally blinding godrays/bloom. 
---
It’s the board game version. If you roll the dice and land on a certain space you have to drink a little ampule of river water, which may or may not be contaminated.
---
(No. I just fucked up the name. I’m leaving it. Too late now.)
---
They should just make perception give a boost to ranged.
---
Hahahaha
---
Bethesda already stated that they have no interest in making this cross platform even if MS and Sony agreed to it 
---
Psst. I know.
---
Here are the patch notes. Copy and paste the change here.

So you’re telling me there’s a chance 
---
What is this “market chat” you speak of? 
---
In the second video, that is the first time they killed me, and the entire time all the hit markers were white, and I did not engage them at all. 
---
Again the intention of the link is not for you guys to scrutinize, but to allow others a place to post like video's, if other cheaters/hackers, let's leave the scrutiny to the developers.
---
I'd be fine with that. Just would entirely defeat the purpose if you had to scrap 15 two shot combat rifles to craft two shot combat rifles, so long as crafting any particular legendary effect unlocked it for crafting that variant everywhere 
---
Can we get a trampoline under that big bridge on our way to the tea house please. I've got some science I want to try
---
Yes.
---
Anyone wanna group up and try to validate this?  Concentrated effort. 
---
Im actually surprised ypu dont know about it
---
Example: final fantasy 14 cross plays between PlayStation and PC, and isn't available for Xbox because Microsoft wouldn't allow the crossplay.
---
i just wanna be able to use the fist style weapons in power armor. even if it requires an arm mod
---
Yeah but not really. My other shotguns are weaksauce.
---
yes!!! I had the same experience
---
Shit yeah good idea! I keep forgetting about power armour! Think I have a full set in my stash 
---
The fixing of the bugs. 
---
Dumb &amp; Dumber quote?
---
You da real MVP.
---
Better yet hang out behind a tree by the overseer's camo and let them think everything is cool.
---
My Vampire Cultist Dagger weighs 0.6 lbs. Very nasty little thing. ;)
---
True but 76 is also a massive departure from Bethesdas typical fallout installment. If done well it could have been fantastic but it wasn't done well and the devs seem intent to keep pouring gasoline onto its twitching corpse.
---
I'd also argue that the live service model is the cashh cow of games so more publishers will see that recurrent income as a reason to develop them. Plus at least fortnight did something well, same with cod. Shooting and movement mechanics, building whatever it is. I can't point to anything 76 does well aside from maybe environmental design. 
---
I really appreciate you picking up on that 
---
I don't think multiplayer online games are for you
---
I didn’t see your post there.  Was guessing it must be somewhere else. 
---
I am not quite sure why you guys are so blind, and aggressive,  but tbh I think you guys have a serious issue understanding the simple intention behind this thread. I'll explain:
---
Click link, post videos of cheaters si developers support group can review, and decide on action.
---
It’s the greatest love story of all time, right? Damn that Mary Samsonite and her mystical briefcase. 
---
Just my luck I find a legendary .38 pipe. Why is my life like this? =(
---
Just bumped into 4 assholes outside my camp shooting at my stuff. All 4 of them got Wanted flags. I meleed 1 low level douche but got killed by others. I respawned at camp and all my turrets, front door, furnitures, stations... were all destroyed. If the game play is like Pubg or Fortnite, I would have killed them at first sight... 
---
Karma for PvP is the best idea I've read on this sub. 
---
I dont know why you get downvoted. I cant blueprint my base aswell, not enough budget. I can only move it as a whole if I log in and someone has already a camp there, so it gets auto-blueprinted.
---
I like your style! - From one Infected Stray to one infected with rad worms.
---
I think I posted a link in Hope's to help clean up fo76, and met some very aggressive, thick headed people. I think you have anger issues, and might need professional help, but these are simply my opinions, and I hope that these aggressive comments can cease, and this link can but put to good use, and maybe one day we can all enjoy the game.
---
Gotta love how apparently they tested this very thing with their QA team and said it was still perfectly possible to kill the SBQ.
---
You might still be able do, but using 4 times more ammunition than before (And you already used 1K ammo before, unless you had a shotgun or a The Dragon) is exactly what people were worried about before, and apparently they didn't care about that in the slightest. 
---
Yes, it would be nice that weapons are actually competent and feel good to use but don't count on it. It's been a few months now and I honestly haven't noticed that much of an improvement at all.
---
But please add rideable deathclaws!
---
Did you cure radworms?

---
Started new character, yeah I'm a sick human being. Enjoying it though. Hyped for xp nerf allowing thorough exploring
---
I've more or less enjoyed 76, giving it a 6/10 - above average. I'm glad I played it immediately after it was released, though. With each patch they make it grindier and grindier, including things they don't include in patch notes, but people figure out through playing, like the current speeded up need to eat and drink much more frequently than before.
---
It's a hugely flawed game, but if you enjoy just doing your own thing and camp building, then you'll probably enjoy this. If you prioritize NPC interactions, making decisions that impact the world, and choices, then rebuy FO 4.
---
Okay, this is it. In the name of the Brotherhood of Steel, we'll cleanse the Earth of this maniac. 
---
Depends. If i don't need the excavator PA, i'll scrap the 2nd frame with it if i have one. Also, I make use of the portable power perk cards. Since i'm always walking around encumbered, depends then when i stumble upon a 2nd frame somewhere. It's always like a balance, what extra bit to scrap next ... 
---
You made a false accusation out of ignorance and also wasted Bethesda's time. You then angrily attacked everyone who pointed out how you're wrong.
---
You can't just admit you're wrong. 
---
I have 3 in chr mainly just cause lone wander is op lol
---
Or the pied piper eyebot which leads the rats around in the middle 
---
I don't think that would be the case. Sure, it could happen from time to time, but my overall encounter with others has been either neutral or positive. I think once everything comes together for this game, everyone playing would be too engrossed in the game to be leaving dumb notes (I don't expect anything like this to be enacted anytime soon).
---
I highly recommend looking for some PS4 players who may be able to help. On a side note I do know there should be plenty laying around. Check around the flatwoods starting area. Some of the scorched carry them
---
Also the more and more hunting rifles you break down the more plans you get for mods so it helps to break em down.
---
Yup. After the third time this happened I started ignoring all the Horde quests. It's ridiculous how far away the map marker is from the actual horde, making the whole thing tedious and too expensive to bother with.
---
Oh its very doable, the question is if they want to spend the day implementing it.
---
It's good to have some friends who match your personality.
---
"I don't see a representation of genocide, hate, and racism as a big deal. If you guys think it's a big deal and experience feelings because of it you guys are really just too sensitive and should get over yourselves." Is basically what you just said 
---
I just left it a while and went back to them and it let me activate them. Thanks anyway though 
---
I think it's better that they have fewer launches now or at least fewer SBQ attacks.  Let the players who have the quest go after it.
---
I was just in the more around some of the bunkers and was reliably seeing those evil things.
---
Jetpack should provide the same. Buff jetpack!
---
Like I said before, you need help bud.
---
It took people this long? 
---
You're not wrong. I just saw a YouTube video about 76 and comments about "innocent" players being banned get hundreds of likes. I know game is a buggy mess, but making fake complains to attract attention is just wrong.
---
Two spawn north of Dyer Chemical in the stream.

for real, most of the terminals look like a Markiplier thumbnail

Ask the same question at r/fo76filthycasuals
---
I think it’s awesome
---
HA NOPE, its worth buying just not for $80
---
Wow!!!  Good job!
---
As someone with Sr. HW Test Engineer as my title, I recognize the effort you've put into this.  Good descriptions.  Good repro steps when available.  Good dives into the code for possible causes.
---
I've been in your shoes.  I had the sr. director of engineering closing a bug as "by design", and I would re-open the bug with comments like "have you even listened to the audio clip I attached?".  (I was a lowly contractor.)  He shows up at my workstation, demands I show him the bug, sits in my chair and starts playing with the O-scope.  (Dude has MSEE from Stanford.  He's the real deal in the lab; knows what's what.)  Shakes his head, stands up, smiles at me, and says thank you.  Basically, the SW engineer put the gain control loop in the wrong spot. ... ... Hang in there.  Doing the right thing is often hard.  Getting someone to listen can be even harder.
---
Same.  👍👍
---
there was a middleground. They removed it
---
Not even for $60, but if you can find it on sale for less then $40 and have both the affinity for fallout and money to spend go fo it 
---
Ask at r/fo76filthycasuals
---
I love it
---
Nar repair yard by watoga.
---
which is?
---
Too buggy rn? I'm expecting this game not to work for quite some time, honestly. Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fallout nerd, but I kind of hate online only games
---
They all can be chambered differently, but yeah the default for the bolt action is .308 and the default for the revolver is .44 (the default for the semi-auto is .38). The weapon will have pipe bolt-action or pipe revolver in the name if it is one if those two that benefit from both rifle and pistol perks.
---
Thx again mate ;)
---
Full disclosure - I haven't actually played 76. My intention was to watch the sub until the overall mood about the state of the game was positive. Needless to say, I'm still waiting.
---
This said, I feel like you are onto something here.
---
Opening vaults and more importantly - building them like high level raids, would be a really really attractive feature.
---
Something that produces unique rewards, high level content that required complex team coordination to beat, a mix of puzzles, complex combat scenarios. Think Destiny raids, leveraging more than just the movement mechanics.
---
yeah, melee is the only thing that works now. Sad times. 
---
I therefore stopped playing until they will revert this excuse of a patch and add more content as well
---
Right, so... let's ban the Cross, let's ban the American flag, let's ban Nike. Let's ban basically every symbol throughout mankind's history. Arguing that the symbol used by the Nazi's (which they stole btw) is as stupid as somebody saying they should ban and/or boycott cotton, because it's historical ties to slavery. It's a symbol. Shut up, get over it and go on with your day. 
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted the devs have done multiple things that defy rationale or logic.
---
Could you even imagine the bugs cross platform given the ones we have now?
---
I like the idea of it. I wonder though if PC would have the edge in PvP. It's not really a twitch shooting kind of game admittedly but they have all the advantages in terms of fps, accuracy and raw power.
---
It's barely worth $0
---
Not for buggyness or anything but for lack of gameplay. There's just barely anything to do and nothing is in depth.
---
More time for Red Dead Redemption 2
---
It is certainly buggy, a lot of them are seriously annoying too although they do try and fix them. The games main quest line is in my personal opinion, quite monotonous but its not hard to make your own fun. Expect a lot of grinding, especially in the higher levels. If you have people to play with its much better but if not i think its still worth playing
---
Depends on how much time you get 
---
I paid $80 and already have 180 hours but I still have the story line to finish and a bunch of other things to do 
---
If you can get a dollar an hour of entertainment out of it I don't see why it isn't worth the money 
---
My obsession to play
---
I'm only level 60, but my friends who are not even level 30 and have barely done anything story wise, all complain about a lack of story cause they refuse to play through the story
---
Because the bobby pin was just a bug that had already been fixed. while the stealth bug is a new problem
---
I'd even buy the living shit out a that if it was a DLC. It's my most unfavorable thing about fo76. No NPCs sucks arse. Like I know voice actors are expensive but damn surely there are people in the company that are able to do it for a bonus on their salary.
---
Never mass scrap anything. This games UI is so buggy things swap in and out of their sections I was scrapping some shotguns from uranium fever and out of nowhere it tried to insert my power armor chassis in the weapons slot. 
---
Despite what some here will say, it's an enjoyable game. I've sunk several hundred hours into the game and I'm just at end game now. The world map is huge and the environmental story telling is top notch.  The individual stories and quests from some of them can be very sad... depressing even, but it can really pull strong emotions out. 
---
I'd reccomend that you take it slow, listen and/or read all of the holo tapes and terminals. Don't worry about building the perfect character,  you get a chance to respec your character after level 50, albeit 1 point at a time.  
---
One other piece of advice, dont try to pick up every item you come across,  carry weight and stash weight limits will burn you and until you get higher levels it can be a serious challenge to juggle your need for weapons, chems, food and water.  Ammo has weight too, so dont pick up types you dont use it it'll cost you. 
---
One MORE thought, power armor pieces start at level 15, but you can still use the chassis and it gives significant strength, armor and radar bonuses, get a chassis as soon as you can and live in it at low levels, you survive much easier. I rarely use PA now, but it was literally a life (and sanity) saver early on. Lastly, have fun and dont listen to the haters. ;)

Why would anyone pour resources into an enemy that drops no loot half the time rewards trash XP and can become bugged and leave the map anyways? More than likely the level 65 just wanted some flux.

I gave up on the game and hopped back to Skyrim SE. There's a promising multiplayer mod called "Skyrim Together" being developed where the devs actually communicate and listen. The mod is essentially the 2-4 player coop everyone wanted from F76, before it turned out to be a badly-made mmo.
---
It's worth buying, just not for $60.
---
Happnsi without radworms with a full party
---
Yeah, the hot fix was just a matter of applying code they already had. This'll require all-new fixes, which take time.
---
True big brain game design. Making an MMO where enemies will scale to whoever goes to an area first, and then they won't despawn.
---
Character number 1: Takes me 4 gatling plasmas and even some gatling lasers to kill her. All of them break. 
---
Character number 2: Takes me 1 melee weapon to kill her in under 5 minutes without it breaking. 
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
in fact, I can change my settings all around but whenever I look at the .ini file it's always the same. Seems like the .ini isn't actually doing anything.
---
I don't know why I even bother. See the guy shooting at you? He has pacifist mode on. He is baiting you to shoot back at him. And you and your team  mate turned off pacifist mode and shot back at him. Then he killed you. No cheating involved.

My camp is build up 5 stories high on a cliff. Half the time when i start the game, the actual house hasnt been loaded yet and i fall down losing 80% of my health. 
---
Bobby Pins is serious business.
---
I am not sure why we are still debating this. Again this is intended for a link to post like videos of cheaters, and hackers so we can actually enjoy this game again. What is it with you guys. Grow up already.
---
I pissed them off last night and was fine today. It doesnt last long. And I *think* server hopping may undo it as well. 
---
I actually hold the view that the story of Fallout 76 is actually far superior to that of any Fallout game aside from New Vegas. What other game made you feel the emptiness of a world that has endured a nuclear war? Most of the other ones felt like comedy, but this one feels like it's about the few individuals clutching to the last strands of hope in a dying world.
---
Now NV was brilliant, but that game was the exception, not the rule in the Fallout universe.
---
There is no story involving the character's actions in the least. Just a series of events that happened in the past that can be uncovered via holotapea and notes.
---
That's more Lore than story given the absolute lack of control or even direct observation the player has over it. It's only slightly more relevant to the current events than a newspaper on the Great War would be.
---
Without power armor or a Hazmat suit, your pretty screwed in nuke Zones. You get like 59 rads/sec without any protections. I use excavator armor and i still have to use several Rad away to survive. I get like 2-3 Rads/sec.
---
Not being rude but Nuke Zones are for higher level. Try leveling up and then come back. Its makes no sense to join such an avent if you cant handle the enemies/radiation. Also nuke Zones are really boring as a low level. 
---
"Works on my machine" is never a good way to respond to stuff like this. 
---
Anti armor is awesome. Combine it with tank killer and you get really ni e armor penetration. You wanna trade it? 
---
Is it grown up to call everyone hackers and cheaters when you don't understand game mechanics?
---
Oh yeah definetly. Also its not as hard as it looks. 
---
Oh my fuck i want an anti armor handmade now 🤣
---
I can't change the chamber from .38 to anything else? Are you sure that's something that can be done with pipe weapons? Maybe it's a reciever I still need to learn?
---
Fast swinging vampire bowie knife with +1 agility. Also shotguns with enforcer
---
If you use the &gt;!Surveillance System Terminal in the command center of the Whitesprings Bunker, you can select "Initiate Search - Silo xxxx Piece" for the exact silo code piece you need to find and it'll start the small quest "Hide and Seek and Destroy" which will then show where to look on the map. The areas are really small and all you need to find are those ghouls with the beeping backpack.!&lt; That way, you don't have to chance it!
---
I've been looking though that sub and yeah there are some garbage low effort shill posts, but it is nothing compared to this r/fo76. It was pretty tough to be on this sub for a while where any critique was shouted down people were called for JuiceHead to be publicly executed.  
---
Spend that $80 on Anthem, this game you can buy for $30-$40
---
I bought the tricentennial edition from preorder for 80 bucks I don’t feel as if I got my 80 dollars worth 40 would fair in my mind in its current state. Since the nerfs are already applied before you play you won’t feel it as badly as every one else and with the plan changes it will be a fun game to play. getting plans for your camp and workshops  and weapons will give you something to work towards and will give you a lot of exploring. All the major bugs are fixed and the servers feel good I played for 6 hrs today and no disconnects. So taking a workshop doesn’t feel too risky now. And the story is good now that they fixed the holo tapes and they play properly when you pick them up.  I would recommend this game for 40 but no more and I wouldn’t recommend and atom shop purchases until they show that they can make a quality game I’m not supporting them with micro transactions.

It happened again and this saved my life. Thanks again 👍

It's grow up, unless you, or your like minded friend have suddenly become a part of the bathesda support team, and are the ones who can actually see if it's a hack/cheat that's being  used, and determine if further action is required, then I think you're just a couple of trollers who have a serious need for anger management. Grow up, and try letting the professionals do their job.

Going to look for this now 👍

Firstly, Fallout 76 has dropped in price by almost 75%. Second , Bethesda have consistently dropped the ball in handling the game-from lying about the merchandise sold with it, to re-introducing bugs they'd already fixed. If they want the game to succeed, their priority should be fixing the games many issues first, so there are still people playing it THEN worry about dlc and the Atom shop.
---
If enough people leave they'll work harder on fixing it? Genius!
---
So what you're currently aiming for is... less server stability?
---
What you do is have a handful of costumes and play different parts.  First the local guide that leads them to the overseers camp who then happens to walk off.  Then as another new resident in a vault suit that joins them, but hears a noise in the woods and wanders off, telling the new player that you’ll be right back.  Then change into that costume with some chameleon armor and appear in front of them with the chainsaw
---
How are the severs? My internet is pretty damn choppy at times.
---
Cool, delete your involvement with the sub while you're at it so we don't have to hear you complain ever again.
---
Several spawn here, but they do so in rotation with other enemy types. Could be Yao Gui, Scorched, mole miners, etc. 
---
Oh here is your professional support.
---
Thank you for contacting support.
---
If you are having an issue with a specific player, we recommend that you Block this player and do not engage them in any way.
---
Pretty sure I could, tbh
---
From my experience for the most part solid, I’ve had a couple of crashes but i have fairly decent internet so that could be a contributing factor
---
It’s not just one person . I’m on PS4 and I’m constantly suffering of dehydration which never happened before the patch. 
---
I think there's a difference between fucking up the code causing bugs to appear that need fixing and throwing darts at the wall to determine weapon balance.  Someone had to choose the numbers to balance these weapons and obviously they had no fucking clue what they were doing and just threw some shit up there and called it a day.
---
At least recommend a good game and not anthem lol jeez 
---
Get help, honestly buddy you have a serious problem. Just get help
---
One base I had on a cliff and any fast travel had me spawn on a lower ledge.  Another base was by a river and any fast travel had me spawn in the river.  My last base has me spawn in a mountain, but fast traveling to my base again fixes the problem.  A Fast Travel mat would certainly help with spawning in weird locations.
---
Date night with my wife, 80+ Dollars.  3-5 hours.
---
Fallout 76 Tricentenial  edition 80 dollars.  At 300+ hours now.   
---
If it would work hell yeah. In the state its now and if they manage to fix it...not imo
---
Sorry the high end graphics &amp; final fantasy like combo system isn’t enuff for you
---
Good for you.
---
So, I'd basically be better off saving my money then. I truly want to jump all over this game, but if I need "decent" internet, it's not worth it right now
---
Took some time for me too. I think it was some holotape that gave the location from headmistresses office, or the terminal
---
If you see a sale pop off jump on it but if not then yeah dont waste your cash
---
HA lol keep on thinking that bud 
---
You do you 
---
&gt; 2 shot
---
It shouldn't need a legendary effect to be good.  The base weapon itself is fucking garbage and I'd rather have a 2 shot anything else.
---
Name a better game, hotshot
---
It’s was actually an ancient Tibetan symbol for high spirituality ..... Hitler messed it up.
---
Fuck this game

The tattoo man. The tattoo.

Nomnomnom

---
Because editing the weight value of an item is 1 minute of work and fixing an entire stealth system takes days.
---
You missed the part where I mentioned a log in the game of a BOS soldier being thankful for being equipped with miniguns as they chew through Scorchbeasts.  You also seem to ignore that so many dead BOS soldiers elsewhere are equipped with laser rifles.
---
I picked it up at Christmas time for $30, to me it's worth it. Some people piss away $100 in a night at the bar, this game I've played 4X a week for a month now and still going strong.
---
Actually new content...because I think major bugs will always be apart of the game, looks like it’s the best they can do.
---
Go back to CoD, son.

The witcher 3
---
Gta 5

Battlefield 
---
Plus loads more 
---
Because fo76 is garbage
---
That's one mod for one gun.  Yeah, I'll admit the plasma flamer is alright but it doesn't excuse the regular plasma gun being shit and you can't say the same about many other guns like the minigun, LMG, gatling laser, laser rifle, and plasma gatling being trash
---
Instigating is going to be the next 2 shot.   Until it gets nerfed too.

Congrats on the dumbest post I'm going to read all day. You're a moron, get over it and go on with your day.
---
It'd solve so many problems if the C.A.M.P. device was more like a Stewie Griffin time travel pad thing, a flat disk you spawn on. I spent forever getting to the top of Seneca Rocks and finding a stable base to build my C.A.M.P. and 90% of the time I just end up spawning halfway down the mountain or INSIDE it.
---
I agree 
---
It's fun, bro.  I've been playing it 4x/week since christmas and am level 46 and still going strong.  You get kicked off a server occasionally but nowhere as bad as a few weeks ago. On Xbox, for me, it's maybe once every other play and I play for at least four hours at a time.  
---
pc
---
1 No. I like it.
---
2 I'm on PC anyway.
---
3 I meant I'm not sure how effective it is compared to a non-anti-armor handmade.
---
Its impossible for FO76 to be good 
---
FO76, a fucking mess
---
Despite the glitches that do frustrate me from time to time (like the recent bulk junk glitch) I still really enjoy the game. But maybe that’s an unpopular opinion nowadays 
---
radworms.is actually a buff imo.. my carry weight goes up to 640 in my excavator armor.
---
Ok no problem :)
---
Yeah it really is. Armor makes a bigger difference than many thinks.
---
Thats why the queen is so strong.
---
Not quite as sad but felt like something that should be in that “ironic” song by Alannis Morisette:
---
The farmer couple who were drowning in debt, and won the lottery.... Right before the bombs fell.
---
You can find what I assume to be their corpses in their basement together.
---
whats the stealth bug?
---
Nothing I would point to and say, "That's a Guidestone."
---
I assumed most of the stuff on that list is potential future content.
---
I've found some of the locations to be innacurate such as the antique place in cranberry bog, it says there's a front porch with two white chairs but there isn't, and one of the station ones it says it's in green trailer and all I can find is a big green truck which you can't get into. Other locations I've walked round and round in circles and found nothing.  Out of about 7 locations I visited I only found 2 cores &gt;&lt;  
---
Na it's fun 
---
I'll probably but it on the 15th or so, if my internet will cooperate
---
Gatling Laser with charging barrels lasts me 2 SBQ fights, that's like 2000 rounds or so, it's not THAT bad.
---
DPS does suffer from the slow ROF though. 
---
Your comment just solved the mystery of my randomly glowing All Rise I experienced the other day, I thought it was just me lol
---
From the looks of it you ve tried different weapons but i doubt you had a proper build for each weapon, which might explain why they were bullet sponges 
---
No it’s not
---
Blueprints are useless. I can like blueprint 20% of my base.. Hows that useful? 
---
I don't, fallout 76 was a disappointment. It's empty, it's barely a survival game, it's barely an RPG, it's repetitive and it's flat out boring to play.
---
Yep, assumed OP was into some weird stuff.
---
The Nazi swatiska is titled 45 degrees. The one you see is actually the original Hindu/Buddhist symbol of good luck and peace. I've seen them quite often on Buddhist buildings and statues in Asia.
---
I'm aiming for a better game. 
---
With the money Bethesda has, server stability should not be an issue. Bethesda should be able to easily call up Zenimax Studios and figure out a way to create a 100-300 player pvp server for Fallout 76 just like ESO Cryodill. 
---
Just remove all dropped loot from pvp. Remove all the none hostile small wildlife. Crank enemies up to lvl100. Crank health pools of enemies up like 2x. Then bam youll have a pvp server where some crazy action will occur. 
---
I dont have all the answers. Im just a hardcore gamer who hopes writing this could maybe make a difference. 
---
Are the codes solved already for this week? Did my first run yesterday and might wanna do it again. 
---
It's a good game, but I just think a bunch of developers are out of touch with the players. I seen a video and a bunch of them are like older guys from a different era. I don't think they really get what a lot of players really want.
---
I first found him from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HETNLWaAvhY) video. Such amazing ingenuity and precision on console too!
---
Always happens when im in a hurry. I hate it.
---
If all the talk that you haters say were true, it would mean that you guys are Todd Howard's bitches.
---
Another beth fake to raise positivity. This sub reddit is littered with fake accounts. You can tell by checking when the accounts were made (around game launch), by checking who they follow (usually only beth content), by checking their posts (only positive stuff). 
---
I know Im a lil late but on the last table where you can pick up the glasses, and a pen there are perk cards and they just give you a free level up to level one (no actual perks just xp). Maybe they were talking about that?
---
Yeah, it's super bad. It's disappointing, buggy, messy, rushed, cheap, boring, and kinda overall shitty.
---
But I love it.
---
~Country rooooaaads!~
---
I launched my first nuke yesterday solo and after launching and a quick visit to my camp for ammo and cores, i fast traveled to the prima site. Already a few players were there. We took her down in 8mins. You were very unlucky i guess. 
---
Even just a grace period that gives you two minutes or so to rejoin and send you back to the previous server would be great for times like that 
---
You have summoned the troops of pro-beth scorched!!!
---
"Arrrgghh not one of us!"
---
I didn't mean it like that, I was jesting at the fact that their name is Vault-Tec so it was like they were a Vault-Tec employee hyping up the vaults
---
I understand, but usually I'm in the middle of something and don't want to redirect on the off chance they want to give me something. Even more so when I'm already in a team with my fiance
---
Well, you must have killed very few legendaries then.
---
Ah ok ill delete my comment then.
---
Cheers
---
Yes, it is.
---
It could be better. 
---
Gulper lagoon or server hop until you come across the gulper horde event.

Do Rad Worms make you jump higher with marsupial? I have bird bones and no fall damage too. Wanna test some things out. 
---
Yeah but you have to manually do that. 
---
Am I the only one looking at this going "wut"
---
Oh, great, now it's changing from the right resolution that requires the long fix I listed above to the lower resolution IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYING. Well there goes my one hope of playing it properly.
---
You can also sell someone elses liver.
---
This.
---
Fix the bugs. Fix the events. Fix the quests. Make scorchedbeast land on the ground. Make energy and heavy weapons playable. More STASH space. There is a shitton to do right now but "heeeey, we're preparing Survival mode for you!". It IS survival with all those bugs already. Fix the game then expand.
---
&gt;  I am saying a problem might have been created in this reddit that anyone trying to talk about a bug might just be treated like a troll even if they are actually not.
---
So...
---
&gt; I am starting to doubt. and rather than be helpful when the posts pop up
---
Practice what you preach instead, and don't admittedly make the problem worse?
---
Meh. Most honor or karma systems are extremely flawed. Red Dead Redemption 2 for example, is a AAA games that has had plenty of development time by a huge company and has been out for a while now, and yet its honor sucks and would be laughable if it was so bad. If Fallout 76’s potential karma system performed as badly as RDR2’s then I would probably finally well and truly quit the game. Knowing Bethesda it’ll be broken anyway.
---
Fun fact those things exist in real life and they're actually pretty close to the same size, if not bigger. 
---
Oof, they downvote you because you're right.  Lore has really taken a backseat to gameplay.  It doesn't matter how the super mutants were made and if it retcons the lore, it only matters that the super mutants exist now for the players to shoot.
---
Wrong sub. Also, selling muts for 200caps means you have ALOT. Dupe much?
---
One of the things people were "complaining" about was that the ignition cores you made would scrap automatically when using the scrap all command.
---
You should be thankful for those who sacrificed themselves to spend hours complaining about Bethesda so they would fix basic, stupid bugs in this terrible game.
---
Except it still has that one gun, 3 months after launch, that burns all of your ammo in 1 second.
---
Went through one yesterday and it seemed about the same. I go in with a troubleshooter combat shotgun, the 30% to robots helps, all the shotgun perks, bloody mess and max adrenaline, seems to do the trick for me.
---
Thanks, will add to the weapon round up when I circle over to it
---
Go away.
---
Agreed, but you proposals have been presented by several users here.
---
SB queen fight is pointless bc it doesn't feel like endgame and the loot is awful. They haven't addressed this issue so far and honestly I doubt they will. 
---
The settlements are fine for me, the thing that bothers me is that they're pretty much irrelevant throughout the game apart from being the base where you can sleep, cook and craft/repair, you can do all these things in the world without depending in your camp.
---
Thats why people are using camps to farm and not to secure themselves. Camps should be imo your safe hideway place, and not usable as weapons.
---
Also expanding your camp has no meaning apart from ego show off boost. 
---
Camps should be the door to rebuild civilization and improve interaction between players. 
---
I find myself using my camp merely as passing through location. Im rarely there more than 10 minutes. Theres no reason to once you plan ahead where you're going and where crafting stations are located.
---
there is a camo power armor paint if thats what you mean its in the atom store
---
There's no rule in this sub that says you can't sell. and no i don't dupe i can craft mutations.
---
My fast travel point is always 30 feet outside the walls of my camp. Other players fast travel to my front door. Every time.
---
Good for them
---
It isn't even metagaming.  The weapons are just trash and you can't use them.  The minigun is one step above unusable while the LMG best purpose is that of a paper weight.
---
The olive matte green is a dev room paint. I know you're not speaking of the camo.
---
how stupid can these old game developers be to remove npcs and give us a main story so fucking boring, they released the game more unfinished than a fucking embryo
---
when i get radworms i seem to jump.higher..and my carry weight capacity goes up to 640...i love radworms
---
RDR2 looks nice but got very boring, didn’t even finish the game &amp; online mode is worst than fo76 atomic shop
---
All the single player games you’ll get bored &amp; never play again.
---
Battlefield is same crap, but WW2.
---
Anthem will outlast all these games &amp; will be worth OP’s money.  
---
yep..another bug
---
They should have made this more transparent, for their own sake. 
---
I have always wondered why Beth gave their own baby(ESO) away, but decided to make the online version of their adopted baby themselves.
---
In reality they gave all the online babies away.
---
Congrats, l'm in my 80's now and could use something like this.
---
&gt; I have 200 hours and have moved my camp 3 times.
---
Well, I have moved my camp at least 10 times. The vast majority of those were from logging in and finding my camp gone.   Sometimes it was due to another player being in the spot but other times I would go to the spot where my camp was and there would be nothing. 
---
When I went to rebuild it items would be gone. 
---
The fact that you have only moved three times means that you have experienced this far less than I. Probably far less than the OP. 
---
People like me are sick of hearing excuses and having to do work arounds and we just won't it done right .
---
No
---
Ive seen someone make a base called "OPPAI". Literally a giant house of letters. Was funny. 
---
It's a story told in audio-only flashbacks. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the holotapes, you often don't get the full emotional impact of the story because you either miss the tape or it plays in the background while you're fighting off yet another wave of creatures that want to eat you. If the flashbacks were more distinct, and not so often hidden among the noise of gunfire, it might be easier for more people to notice them. I got much more immersed in the story when I started going somewhere safe to sit and listen to the holotapes.
---
gave up when i heard the nerfs were coming. Might try the PVP servers when they go live and watch that shit show.
---
I just play the game, not develop it.
---
Ive started searching in the middle open areas of the Savage Divide and now a general mid map area centering around Arktos Pharma. no luck.
---
Lmfao buy a ps4 and get fallout76 free to it. 
---
Fuck is that sad.
---
There’s other configurations. A laser with an automatic barrel, a splitter and a doubled or quadrupole condition legendary effect. 
---
You’re right on the whole, we’re below where we need to be. If I was BGS I’d tweak up a few weapons to be on-par with their classmates: 
---
But not every configuration or mode option needs to result in a powerful option. Rather, they gave all weapons some generic things (like recoil control, hip fire control, automatic fire, better crits, shotgun or flamer conversions etc. and leave it to the player to work out which combos are good and which are shit. (And which are shit until you do some non intuitive thing or a play style adjustment and work out a way to turn into good). 
---
This was part of fallout 4 and past creation titles, and is part of F76 too. 
---
Then why are you subscribed to anything fallout if you don't like the games? It makes no sense to subscribe to something you simply bitch about whenever you get the chance
---
Yeah add makeshift warrior our you'll be repairing weapons all the time.
---
Yeah new story with different choice with npc hmm it s like asking for.. A new game? Come on wtf they can't even fix their bugs
---
yep, they will learn the lesson!    
---
genius 
---
I wish the same for revolvers
---
Population.  No people at all and you can pull the servers.  A free to play relaunch with more content and a fairer priced Atom Shop is about the only thing that can save the game.  
---
Yeah they nerfed a lot of stuff
---
&gt;reporting someone for making a geometrical shape in a videogame
---
ps4 controller* 
---
And yes that is sad. rip bethesda
---
Still the final mistress quest for me.
---
happened to me on sbq event..took about 15minutes for everything to load..
---
This surprises anyone? 
---
A mod in fallout 4 let you scrap legendary mods(or remove them and add them to another weapon). and the hardest version of the mod required you to scrap enough legendary's for a resource(can't remember the name of it right now).
---
A similar system could work, say 1 Star legendary effects costed say 20 resource, and scrapping any legendary would get you between 1-3. 2 star, 40, and 3 star 60.
---
Would give even the shitty legendary's a use.
---
At least when you fight a Scorchbeast, you usually get a Sweet Victory out of it
---
with radworms my carry weight goes up to 650 in excavator pa
---
You mean 'canvas' and it'll take a year to get it in the mail.
---
Thats pretty much it unfortunately. 
---
You sir, are a god.
---
Can anyone else help? I really need to fix this to keep playing this game.
---
Yeah that's pretty accurate. And I'm sure they have different teams for handling technical issues and for game design/balancing. That said, both teams dropped the ball pretty hard haha. But as a would-be heavy guns main (that has to pull out his super sledge anytime a real enemy appears), I feels. I feels.
---
proc??
---
I don't think it is future content, it's more likely pointing to Easter egg locations etc.. 
---
The quarentene is most likely referencing huntersville
---
This is not the official Bethesda forum, for official analyzing and official "further actions required" my dude.
---
&gt; not every configuration or mode option needs to result in a powerful option.
---
But every configuration should result in a usable option.  Too many weapons are not.
---
&gt;human NPC's
---
No, fuck no. No more creepy staring, no more repeated lines, no more annoying dialogue.
---
No human NPC's is one of my favorite things about Fo76. Please, no.
---
That’s what I’m saying. Some should be possible to assemble, but be terrible once you actually tried using them. 
---
Yeah this is the core of the 'theres no story' complaint; y'all don't want to go find it, you want it read to you like it's bedtime.
---
We are using chat mod on PC to find enough people for sbq event
---
I don't think there is anything definitive but a lot of people do their own experiments with this and have found that luck dosn't effect the legendary spawn rate.
---
Someone has to ask this, just to make sure: you aren't running around in power armor, are you?
---
Because bobbypins was just a simple value change from 0.1 to 0.001, and had been changed in a previous patch without any added bugs. 
---
The code to fix stealth, is much more intensive and likely to cause other bugs/issues if not implemented carefully with thorough QA. 
---
Hello ! Interested here ! thanks :)
---
on ps4 u just hit L2 4.times.to get to zero
---
Lol ok
---
Agree with the different storage. Even if its just something like a chems box, ammo box, or a wardrobe for non-armor clothing.
---
i dont know how to message. only reply to your post..i have marsupial.serum. will you swap for violet flux?
---
But what I'm saying is too many weapons in this game are totally unusable in any real sense and that isn't okay.  There should be good and bad synergizing mod combinations but overall every mod combo should result in a weapon that you can use to reliably kill things.  Instead, there are some weapons where you just can't reliably kill shit unless you burn through ammo and make a repair run every 10 mins.
---
I know the feeling. I got way more immersed in Skyrim's story after getting some alone time with The Lusty Argonian Maid.
---
By the mechanics of some of these guns (looking at you, minigun), durability is a required trait. IDC about the gatling gun with 2 shots per second, tops. I'm talking about the minigun and gatling laser that break after literally a minute or two of actual use (as is OP). If not for Heavy Guns in general, they absolutely need to address the issue with high rate of fire weapons like these.
---
I see two viable options. A) Give us repair kits like we've been suggesting for months. Or B) Make the durability parameter factor in the rate of fire for each individual weapon into its durability. This would also be nice because it would make different fire rates for the same gun (ie an automatic barrel) affect the overall amount of shots you can put through it before it breaks. It's simply uneconomical to use any high fire rate weapon with these mechanics. Equal or less dps *and* more ammo *and* more repairs. This goes for rifles or miniguns.
---
yes it is quite annoying
---
Still get decent stuff got 3 star grognaks axe bloodied 40% faster swing and takes 40% less damage while power attack yesterday. 
---
i saw a dead ghoul actually walking along..i shot it thinking it was alive...then realized it was a dead ghoul walking
---
Because anyone who has better stuff than you is a duper? The vast majority of people with an improbable equipment load either purchased or were given their stuff.
---
If you want Bethesda to catch dupers by examining player inventories, it would make much more sense to look for stacks of anything but ammo numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Even mules for a group would be unlikely to have that much of something.
---
Yes, you have to scrap weapons or find plans in the world to rechamber weapons. Some can be leaned by scrapping, some need plans.
---
We jumped higher for sure.  Not sure how to replicate it though. ...ive had radworms many times and this was the first Ive seen the gliding.
---
Allow me to bring an oldschool example, because I’m old (43) and my teeth and brains are falling out. 
---
There was once a game called MechWarrior: Mercenaries. You got to pilot mechs. Find new chassis, with ever more slots, and stick guns, missiles, lasers and flamers into those slots. 
---
Using what was in those slots heated your chassis up. 
---
Too much heat and it’s shut down. 
---
Way too much heat and you’d blow yourself up. 
---
And there was an oh shit button. An oh shit I just turned a corner and ran into a mech twice my size and with twice the firepower, and the only thing I’ve got going for me is the 0.75 seconds before he notices me. 
---
It was called an alpha strike. 
---
It fired every darn thing you had mounted on your chassis then and there, and consequences be damned. 
---
We all wanted to see what happened if you took the biggest chassis (the atlas), loaded it up with the biggest guns, and tried an alpha strike. 
---
You’d die. That’s what’d happen. It was a terrible idea. 
---
And the point of this story. Is that the game made it possible to put all that shit in and even fire it off all at once, but it also gave the player room to be stupid, and brought down the consequences that made it clear why it was stupid. 
---
When my automatic splitter-equipped laser broke in F76 after four or so mags (if that), that’s how it felt, that this was something stupid to do, not that the gun was balanced badly.
---
Same here. Level 3, 11 luck. I let a level 1 dog just keep biting me with Med-x on to test it, not one proc in 10 minutes. Which sucks because since the hotfix, everything seems to be breaking faster than ever. 
---
Most dupers give things away for free when they're feeling generous.
---
I mean is he wrong for that though.
---
some dingdong makes a burning cross or a USSR banner, do we all cry about it and mock up an echo chamber to circlejerk about how awful history is? 
---
nah. 
---
some dingdong made a swastika. itll be gone tomorrow. you'll probably forget about this whole post in like an hour. 
---
absolutely..id rather nuke whitespring..also im finding it hard to make flux..i joined a nuke.zone and didnt get one single high radiation fluids
---
Any blueprints? Stored blueprints count towards budget.
---
That may reduce the rate at which fusion cores are consumed from "are you fucking kidding me" to "are you guys serious," but that's still a lot of fusion cores. :)
---
There’s plenty of cures for depression. Not many for being an insensitive twat though. 
---
Games being released too soon is probably down to suits and executive type people. Personally I don't have an issue with the style of storytelling through holotapes and notes etc. It all makes sense in the aftermath of a nuclear war. I think that part is really well done and the writing and voice acting is top class. To me personally there are many issues with loot and reward systems, and PvP etc. People these days don't like the grind. They want to speed through. A lot of people don't even care about story and just want to grind XP, or caps, or loot. They make that more tedious with every patch. Epic fights don't feel rewarding. Etc. 
---
I know it's basic stuff like Skinner box, Pavlov's dog, carrot on a stick, hamster wheel, treadmill game BS. They have their ideas how they want to control players, limit them, slow them down, make them play longer, but players have their own ideas how they want to go fast and get all the best stuff and grind it out as fast as possible and have fun, most of all have fun doing what they want to do. 
---
So yeah a lot can be blamed on the suits etc. for rushing it out with deadlines etc. I'm sure the devs would have come up with much more refined and better systems if they had been given more time to perfect them. But now it just seems like a scramble to retain players, which will only push more away who resent being artificially slowed down.
---
That's only worked since the last patch.
---
I might have to have a few rounds then 😁
---
Is the search function to OP for you? Should be a dozen threads about this by now .  
---
There’s no guarantee they meant it negatively, and honestly? It’s kind of funny, in an immature way. I don’t think we need to get too upset about it, and no, that doesn’t mean we’re ignoring the sacrifices of those who died fighting Hitler’s Germany, or those that suffered during his tyranny.
---
It’s a video game, and someone wanted to be a troll. Move on.
---
People only complain because they want the game to be the best it can be. The people who were on the hate train have moved on to anthem and ea by now and the only complaint and bug reports are from real players who actually want to see the game get better. And since Bethesda doesn’t have a super great way of addressing bugs and things of the like it is  easier to post on here so people can see what you think. Bethesda might take notice. Instead of getting an automated response that no one will ever see. Any one who thinks we should stop complaining are only hurting the game by slowing the progress and direction of the game. Bethesda has a large fan base who truly wants them to succeed. Although I do see some posts of pure hate rather than true complaints and bugs that need addressed. So if you mean hate than I can see that maybe there are a lot of post that just hate the game. If the game was in a better more stable state though the community could discuss more about gameplay and the future of the game. But it’s hard when all you see is server disconnects and game breaking bugs that need to be addressed in order to enjoy the game you want to enjoy.

flux is easy to get..its the high radiation fluids that are rare..last 3 nuke zones iv found no HRF
---
7.62mm?
---
Are you sure the Meteoric sword can be modified? (I haven't found it, so I'm really asking. Like, damage it and try to mod it.)
---
With that bit I agree with you. 
---
That has been shown many times to not be the case.
---
That guy doesn't build defenses.
---
This perk,as far as a I know, doesn't slow food and water consumption. It makes the effects of thirst and hunger less severe. 
---
Mainly one mutation serum.
---
I know his arguement is super loose and altogether incorrect, but if you can't get over fake internet nazi trolls, you're going to have an extremely bad time. 
---
it's wasted breathe. your reaction is what they want, so there's credence in the last of his sentiments... though he could have said it... better?
---
There is a simple fix for SBQ fight: give it a guaranteed unknown high-end recipe as loot.
---
Not sure if you know, but you can loot hardened and glowing mass as well as high radiation fluids from other player-killed meat piles.  Just running through the golf club should net you some. 
---
I usually end up low on glowing masses. 
---
(did you mean "value is *relative*"?)
---
Can you point out the rule that states trading is prohibited here, or are you just going to keep reporting OP because you don't want to see it here?
---
Someone most likely destroyed your base completely.
---
Are you sure Bethesda just randomly deletes their player’s camps? 
---
Don’t blame Bethesda for everything, blame me b/c I probably destroyed your base. LOL
---
I also run a stealth sniper build, but my weapons remain the same as before patch. Do u have the mutation adrenal reaction by chance?
---
I'm game.
---
Do you need help with the statistical analysis? (I'm a mathematician.)
---
Not sure if I have any, I think I do if I remember correctly! Will message you after work when I’m online ! 
---
No, that's HILARIOUS!!
---
I was crying, I was laughing so hard.
---
He got EXACTLY the reaction he wanted to elicit from you.
---
Too be honest, I do not believe that its lack of NPCs that is the source of the feeling that 'something is missing here'. In fact, you will never be able to have interactions with an NPC that could be as engaging as an interaction with a living person could be. Those alliances you wish to see formed. Those day to day stories being exchanged. Those crisises that shake the communities - those all things would be better if they were done by players, and here is where I believe F76 is missing the most. We can't build shared settlements, we cannot rebuild, we have no tools to shape the communities in game and we need external tools to do that. We can't even chat using our pipboys, nor induce custom events, and usually when we go online we see completely different set of people.
---
No. We already have the broken system of bounty. We don't need second more complicated one which can be broken more.
---
Also. Never interacted before. There is no way the servers could track that much.
---
HEIL TODD!!
---
No, *OP thinks* she is dead. 
---
No they won't.
---
Is it really so difficult for you to picture a world where people like things you don't?
---
You're gonna have a rough go of life with such a self-centered attitude. 
---
Does that gear protect from radiation?
---
No. 
---
False advertising, released a game in a completely broken state, terrible communication, blaming the community instead of taking responsibility, nerf after nerf after nerf instead of actually balancing the game, HEAVILY committed to PvP even though the entire community playing the game is yelling for PvE content. 
---
Shall I go on, or do you now understand why people are 100% justified in complaining. Company's cannot be allowed to get away with crap like this and as consumers our only two options are; don't buy the game or complain. Well Bethesda refuses to refund anyone even though FO76 is NOTHING like what it was advertised to be, so that only leaves us with complaining. If you don't want to complain, fine, but the rest of us that spent $60+ on a game are going to complain since this isn't at all the game we were led to believe it would be.
---
my tesla.rifle.lasts a long time..its a rifle, big gun and energy weapon.apparently..but my tse laser rifle breaks.after.killing about 5 mole miners
---
this would be nice but this is genuinely a situation where the age of the engine is the limiting factor, theres no real npcs in the game not by choice but by need, the engine was built for 32 bit systems it does not have the ability to handle that much data in memory at once
---
even the robot "npcs" that give quests are  not actually npcs, they are nothing more then animated switches that give a quest following an invisible track, literally if you go into the creation kit using "the method" discovered you can see firsthand the entity names and the "npcs" are actually just switches
---
Nah i wish it was as simple as someone destroying it. All my stash materials are gone too. Im not saying Bethesda is targeting me lol. Its obviously a bug but a really flustrating one p
---
Why did you get banned? 
---
Lol this company legit scams its customers and steals their money 
---
ikr..i can kill.about 5 mole miner with my tse laser rifle.b4 it breaks
---
It's got nothing to do with AbUsE, it's a load order issue and sadly I don't think it's going to be changed
---
Cool Story Bro. So where is your proof ...
---
Yeee this game needs to die, and I’m on an in-game griefing crusade to destroy as many people’s bases until Anthem comes out, LOL
---
I would rather buy the comics. 
---
This happened to me once, sort of--I fast traveled to a friend without checking to see where he was. 
---
I had no hazmat suit or power armor. There was nothing I could do. I just died, over and over, automatically respawning into the event area because, oh, yeah, my predicament was also making a SBQ fight harder for everyone. A couple of nice people stimmed my level 12 butt at first, but I couldn't make it to safety and I don't blame them for giving up.
---
It was hilarious.
---
Super duper boosts 30%, and aparently it's calculated from the nominal amount that's not boosted by perk.
---
I have no advice, but I feel your pain. I only take workshops for fast travel points unless I'm on a full team of friends who will inherit what I built.
---
Several of the posters claiming to be innocent seemed highly suspicious that they were either probably modding or receiving large quantities of modded goods possibly from a friend and ended up getting banned as well. Bethesda did do a post stating that a lot of these other posters claiming that they were unjustly banned was completely false. On one hand you have a user it is very likely to lie to gain sympathy from subreddit, and then on the other hand you have Bethesda who has of late has been known to be... Extra stupid lately. 
---
At the end of the day I would hope that Bethesda has enough of their shit in order to hopefully not be carelessly banning people... Hopefully...
---
Idk I heard it so I was asking if it’s a bunch of BS or true. So far seems true seeing how they banned a bunch of people who spoke out
---
Nice, my first explosive drop was a nocturnal combat shot. It was nice since I was using shotguns a good deal. Still haven't seen a two shot weapon. 
---
Never heard of the mods being paid, could you link me to a source please?
---
As for the other stuff, I've seen a few youtubers cover a story about one post that was removed and I didn't think that was right but I haven't heard of it happening prior or again. (I'm not looking for that info so I may of made a redundant point)
---
Your post seems a little agressive so I doubt mods will give you the time of day for a discussion, but I am interested in the response if you get one.
---
I enjoy the game and personally haven't run into 99% of the bugs people on the subreddit complain about. Currently lvl 90. BTW if u hear people crying about bullet sponges, then they haven't built for damage. I one-shot all regular units and take about 5 shots on mirelurk queens or behemoths with a legendary combat rifle. What's annoying is that too much people whining don't understand the game.
---
 I bought the game at a discount but would be hesitant to pay the full 60.
---
I'd be down for that as well!
---
It is a social experiment to see if people see positive things over negative. If you can then it's worth
---
I think they removed this(I think it was possible in FO4), because you would never run out of bullets.
---
I mean it’s probably be pretty hard not to find someone who hasn’t received a “duped” item at this point so that seems sums to ban someone for buying items with caps. Idk but that’s just me. 
---
Like the tales about ppl getting banned for crafting?
---
I want flaming unicorns. 
---
Yeah there was one guy who even had a random reddit user trade with him and said there wasn’t anything bad about his inventory. People still called them a liar lol
---
And now, instead, we throw away bullets. 
---
There's a lot of shilling in this subreddit. They have PR maarketing people who try to control the narrative. Try to control opinion. Bully dissenting opinions with downvoting them. They want to control what people who read this subreddit see. They can try, but they are fighting a losing battle. It is completely futile. They are achieving NOTHING.
---
This is great
---
Reread what I said. Receiving large quantities. According to some of the reports Bethesda has released people were carrying hundreds of thousands of pounds have items on one character. Even if someone was running a store or shop selling things like nuka colas I seriously doubt that individual would have 10000 nuka colas, nuka cola cherries and nuka cola quantum's. Maybe a few hundred or a thousand... But not a damn mountain of them. 
---
no.worries ...thnx
---
Are you sure that this isn't really a consequence of a cap on the maximum effective value of SPECIAL stats?
---
Shut up and keep gaming
---
Proc= programed random occurrence.
---
What level are you?
---
Currently at 87
---
yeh i do this..all iv been getting is glowing mass a d hardened mass..i have 50 hardened mass and zero high radiation fluids😢
---
nukacrypt . com usually has them poster pretty quick
---
Seems its broken then.  Hope devs see this
---
Sometimes I don‘t know if I should laugh or cry when I read all this story’s. Like „I‘m innocent and speak the truth, alle the oO and XX in my nick testify that“
---
Must be an oversight, the bombs droped at 9:17
---
Nice, just hit 41, trying to find all the camp plans but I feel like most of them are quest rewards 
---
ok..thnx
---
Everywhere I got there's a trail of bags with ammo I don't use
---
The best way I’ve found to get the camp plans is taking/ defending workshops.
---
If you don’t want to “waste” the caps on claiming a workshop, just keep an eye out for any that are already owned and have a defend event running.
---
Pop over there and help out, and you should get a camp plan along with a couple other goodies.
---
You on PC or console?
---
If got the Charleston freeze (for over a minute) as well but i dont got the other issues.
---
Im also running a Ryzen 2700x wit an RTX 2080.
---
Did you listen to the dead Assaultron voice recording in the corner (down the stairs) in the room where you first enter the bunker?
---
Console, Xbox. Yeah I have to do that more often
---
Yeah I agree. I think it’s obvious when someone’s duped you can tell pretty easy just by looking. Go after them, not the people who made honest mistakes. 
---
Glass cannons have their downfall too.  it's balanced. 
---
In that case, feel free to add me and I can give you some plans I already have if they’re ones you want/need??
---
GT is PixelD0T
---
From a closer read of the topic, it seems that the author is commenting on the typical response to criticism on this subreddit, not telling people who complain to shut up.
---
Not yet, afaik. I still need to take my time exploring the bunker entirely.
---
AA E is the new kid in town.
---
Shh, don't say such things, you may bring the attention of the nerf overlords.
---
The game is not to blame for their shitty servers, If they have server stability problems maybe they should get better servers? Proper servers for an online game?
---
Do that and than we can talk about feeling good working for them. :D 
---
The assultron head is there in a pile of metal junk.
---
Yeah pretty much haha
---
Soooooo you and u/Infinite_Worm are buddies huh? 
---
It so cute watching internet trolls be born.
---
Will do! Though I figured that working for them must have a catch ;)
---
RAM, 16GB or 32GB?
---
I order now another 16 for my rig.
---
Your specs are rather old. You're correct that your CPU is the bottlrneck. Do remember that clock speed does is not the best form of comparison. The FX 6300 has very poor IPC (instructions per cycle) compared to the newer chips. So clock speed can be very misleading. It's ranking is in the 100s on userbenchmark, which suggests it's highly outdated.
---
Since you're using an old chip, I assume your motherboard is using AM3+ which only supports up to 1866mhz ram, even if you were to upgrade. As a comparison, you get about 15% more fps between 2133mhz and 3000mhz (found out through public benchmarks).
---
If u wanted to upgrade CPUs you'll need to buy a new motherboard (80-120, depends on quality) and a CPU (Ryzen 1600 99$ on sale) and new ram 3000mhz 2x8 ($100). Then your next bottleneck would be GPU, but a 1050ti is good enough for low settings 
---
Well I would hope Bethesda is not banning people for simply receiving or legitimately trading for an item that they did not know was duped. Especially when the duping issue is directly responsible for their lazy updates and poor development - I could go on about this but I won't. 
---
Not that the dupers are innocent either. But their noses are far more clean due to Bethesda responding to the duping in such a laxidasical time frame and piss poor effort. 
---
but then again this is Bethesda we're talking about...
---
Sweet thanks! I'm ZegramZombie, I play mostly on weekends 
---
Idk... video driver up to date?
---
Anything you would want in return? I could gather some stuff for ya?
---
There are plenty of events that timeout before someone joins them and several you can't fast travel to start them. Been around since at least the last major patch on pc for me. I've joined plenty that instantly fail or I can fast travel to them. If you go to the ones that you can't travel to they never start.
---
I just started playing 76 last night and still trying to get my head a round "Block for this session"
---
So it hides my location on their map?
---
Does it also make my character invisible to them? 
---
Can they still see me?
---
I'd literally only been playing for about an hour before some +60 level jerks started griefing me. I can deal with the buggy graphics and NPCs but the leveled up assholes on their are really killing it for me
---
Haha the spammer! I read his post earlier and wanted to see  what happened with that. I wanna know if he’s a liar and a cheater xD
---
Why is everyone so pissy today. 
---
Haha it has many meanings in many cultures date it back to the begining its a flow of life used by the norse. Its a symbol of balance used by the ancient chinese. Its a symbol of what you reflect off it because its what you believe. Dont accept it and its not your to bare. 
---
Never leave your safe space. Wouldn't want you to experience the real world.
---
Hahahaha gold!
---
And I encourage everyone to continue to point out their hypocrisy. While they get on their soapbox about "cheaters" they are here cheating on reddit. Exploiting this system for their benefit. If I could report them to reddit, to take a closer look at the upvoting and downvoting on this sub I would. Maybe I will look into that.
---
I always feel the worst for people holding out hope for the *FPS sandbox* this game could become. Because they are so entirely right. That's what this engine screams out to be.
---
But, Anyone at Bethesda Studios who was interested at all in creating a great first-person combat sandbox in the footsteps of Halo, Far Cry, or  DOOM are gone now.  The new guard at Bethesda Austin doesn't want to trust the playerbase with dedicated modding tools to create interesting scenarios in their sandbox. Or even compromise with soft in-engine editing tools like Forge or Garry's Mod or GTA Online. They included a neutered settlement system with contempt. It serves more as an outlet to give the Atom Shop purpose instead of its initial gameplay function to give the player a slow but powerful sense of progression as they raise their own city out of the dirt driftwood plank by driftwood plank in Fo4. 
---
Bethesda Austin is entertaining none of this because they have been given exact orders to make a looter shooter competitor to steal some market share from Anthem, Destiny, and Division. 
---
You keep making threads criticizing the loot nerfs, the enemy bullet sponginess, the characterless and weak feeling gunplay. You keep complaining you feel stuck on a hopelessly grindy treadmill as all the unpredictable sandbox fun keep getting filed down more every patch. They're not oblivious. They're completely aware of what they're doing and giving themselves a pat on the back for a job well done.   
---
16 GB which should be enough.
---
People used to do passive runs in 3 and NV, so it's not unlikely.
---
Easiest way is just to party up and let teammates kill for quests.
---
I see plenty of criticizing posts that stay up. If they just say something low effort like; “game bad”, then I can see why it would be deleted. Or if they’re just trying to start shit in the community. 
---
Most subs don’t allow you to just be negative without actually contributing anything useful to the dialogue. 
---
I like that this is how the fo76 sub has ended up. 
---
This probably won't get listened to either ;)
---
Need that Mister Fisto mod for all your fisting pleasures.
---
You can easily get your money worth, even if you bought the game on the release date. It's more fun with group of people, but soloing is not too bad either. Realistically the game is a good 8/10. Reviews below 7/10 are just embarrasing themselves.
---
I'm pretty keen on reading.  But there's a couple of flaws here.  First, it's a mixed media environment, having the entire narrative purely in text or audio log form is a bit disappointing, especially so in a series that was made famous for it's great dialog and living characters.
---
Secondly, a lot of the stuff you can read is monotonous, uninteresting and irrelevant.  I started off reading every single terminal entry and bit of paper, but soon found that most of them told me nothing interesting or useful at all.  Sure, throw in a few mundane things here and there like grocery lists, pad out a person's diary a little bit; but the script and text in this game is just so stilted, slow moving, and takes far too long to say far too little.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the storyline as such.  I just don't think it has been implemented well at all.
---
It's not so hard if you have a build that isn't balanced. My current build is overwhelmingly geared towards fighting queens. If your build isn't set up for it, it will take the entire event time to get close to killing her. If it is set up for queen fights, you can spend 25 minutes killing adds for loot and XP, then finish her off in 3 minutes. On one hand, it's maybe mean of me to knowingly hold off and let others waste their resources and weapon condition, but it seems like just as many people get pissed off when you kill the queen before they have time to fast travel into the event. 
---
It seems obvious to me that most builds are set up to have an easygoing, fun time with 99% of the game, not to be good at 1% of the game's content. At this point Scorched Earth is the only event I bother doing.
---
Assault vs combat vs radium vs handmade:
---
handmade &gt; combat = radium &gt; assault
---
&gt; hoping she was alive and well
---
I take it you hadn't heard the developers state that the only humans in the game would be real people then?
---
Yep happened to me yesterday. Large number of legendaries but weapon drops were pretty average except for a 2 shot fat man. The protectrons kept arriving wave after wave, and for me it was just at the golf club.
---
Everytime it happens to me, I drop an item (usually a grenade or some food) and the spinning stops, showing usual loot on all nearby corpses I've hit at least once.
---
Hope it helps.
---
Explossive diarrhea was nerfed.. now it only drips.....
---
You think they have bots that upvote and downvote people?
---
Semi auto for more planned and tactical approach, slower rate of fire but superior accuracy.
---
full auto for sprayin' and prayin', overwhelming foes with a relentless spray of metal
---
Long barrels are superior is everyway other than weight.
---
I love the way they put them on the holotapes too, it’s like straight out of an old 1940’s radio serial
---
Me: Behold my heavy military grade weaponry! DIE RAIDER!
---
Raider: RaWR! Board with nails!
---
Me-dies.
---
True - Quick automatic weapons
---
Stabilized - Sniper weapons that have to be aimed
---
Aligned - Shotguns and those looking for a more balanced approach.
---
Note: aligned is prefered for pvp as vats is very useful, yet the ability to scope yoir oponents out may make the difference
---
Great writing, nicely laid out. Don't lose heart that Reddit isn't paying attention, there's an agenda around these parts!
---
Why stick to one? Why not rotate through them when you feel like it?
---
That makes no sense as an explanation in this case, as if he solo'd the queen he did ALL the damage.
---
...wow.
---
Was it a girl with green hair? That combo of emotes is my go to lol
---
I don't have the empath mutation, as I mainly play on my own.
---
Typical millennial vault dwellers
---
And for the last point, really depends on what weapon you are talking about and your style of combat
---
That may be caused by the servers. But unsure. Todd howard anounced on stage that we wouldn't even recognize the servers while playing, so surely there has to be another explanation for this...
---
I haven’t bought any and there a lot of caps/money trying to figure out what the best one is to get first
---
Not true, try again.
---
500 caps and a vigorous handy.
---
Dude I'm 99% sure he's trolling. You really want to get him banned or punished for making an assortment of boxes? Yes, it's distasteful, but you're literally doing exactly what he wants. Giving him attention. 
---
That atom sniper outfit makes me look silly. I regret my 1400 atoms. 
---
If an item is available permanently and I really, really want it but I don't have enough atoms, I can work on completing challenges until I've earned enough free atoms to make the purchase.
---
OTOH, if the availability is limited to a short window, I have a choice: miss out (possibly on a permanent basis) on something I really, really want...or purchase atoms with real money.
---
Limited availability exists to force this choice and (they hope) drive atom purchases.
---
I have. I have a shit ton of legendary armour from there. 
---
This is sarcasm,of course, I presume?
---
I don't think it's bots just individuals who are paid to do it. There are a few very obvious shills on this site, but they are smart enough to criticise Bethesda once in a while, and pretend to be playing the game, having an issue with the game, have some complaint about the game etc. If you're smarter you can see through the fake BS. Because underneath it all is total shilling 100%. Sometimes a negative post will start getting some traction with regular user upvotes, then in a few seconds it will get a bunch of down votes. I watch this subreddit and pay attention to a lot of things. I have a list of a few of the most obvious shills.
---
Nice
---
Kk that will be last on my list to buy
---
The robots will save me from my trivial daily tasks of finding real food and doing manual labor.
---
That is terrifyingly brilliant. It looks like the things nightmares are made of.
---
No, quite a few. All my drops are pieces of armour. I've had to buy legendary weapons from vendors 
---
Auto seems to be better damage per sec, but consumes more ammo than non-auto.
---
With automatic weapons, I tend to favour recoil mods. Non-auto accuracy mods.
---
Usual go for Forceful Stock for more weapon durability, but still get some recoil.
---
If ammo capacity magazines give a lot more capacity, I choose them over armor penetration ones.
---
Sight/Scope always Short Scope or lesser.
---
You don't need a table--you can do the math! *high five*
---
Unlock all their locks so they have to spend the materials to fix them up again.
---
I'm aware of my potato I was just asking if it was just me or was the game just not optimized I have no issues with any other games, as far as the parts I'm using, I had a better mobo for my fx but it died, IPC was not my issue 600mhz oc with no change In framerate my entire platform is out of date
---
Read it again... even closer? It literally says "Shut up and stop complaining" referring to people talking about bugs, people with concerns about how Bethesda is handling this, and people who are mad that they didn't get what was advertised to them.
---
Oh I forgot it was my cake day lol
---
Okay hold up, within the few hours ive spend wandering. Im finding this to be a bit BS. Your whole new account doesn't help your case in any way you put it. Now to go under the [image](https://i.imgur.com/Sy1cSq4_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium) provided below and your only suggestion of "Middle of the map", this body of water must be a puddle or a small ass connecting river to the rivers that are shown on the map. Along with the fact I dont know what the OP constitutes as a factory, but the only real *Factories* per say, that's within the middle of the map and in a colorful forest (IE **The Forest** area), would be Arktos Phrama, Mama Dolces, and I would call a stretch to inlcude Tygart Water and Monangah Power. Searching the areas around these provide jack diddly squat in terms of *bodies of water*. Ive strolled around the barren parts the Divide nothing even looked close never mind the fact its all dark autumn colored.   
---
Well if it makes you feel any better. I refunded both my copies of the game and they still have my "Account" in good playable standing,  I deleted it tho.
---
Not going to play 76 anymore. Was very disappointed with it. 
---
Is anyone still positive to this game? I gave them the benefit of the doubt in the beginning but I'm done with that. It's clear they just don't care at this point.
---
I think this best captures it, and what everyone is commenting on: [https://imgur.com/a/qBoLaeV](https://imgur.com/a/qBoLaeV) 
---
This was implemented to prevent a duping exploit. It is intended. Not a bug
---
hunters coat with the enclave hat makes my character look like one of the nazis in Wolfenstein 2 tbh
---
Wow. I have been Instagraming every glitch i've come across since Day One. Found a dead travelling merchant that is a deathclaw, a scorchbeast's screech hovering on land, headless scorch attacking me, a angler's spit hovering in the air, a stuck liberator above a power plant, and many more.

Then we could build a T.O.W.N, and have human NPC settlers, let’s rebuild America! 
---
You mean you just want to pretend to be a regular user?
---
Worst is when this happens with the SBQ. Seeing as its body despawns so quickly.
---
Then ask somebody to make you one. I suppose, you can trade outfits with other players, so you dont really need to buy them.
---
Lol trying that one for sure
---
I love the idea of having a dog or a cat in the game but as far as engelbert's go... I'd like to put mine up for adoption please. The only thing I want my pet inside of is my safely secured camp. 
---
What's his lvl and ur gt to send proof
---
Good to know that you won't be banned if you were handed the paintjob plans by someone else
---
ridiculously funny
---
Yeah, that chat is godsend for group activities like sbq and charity events that take place quite regularly these days!
---
I got the plan for the Chinese officer electrified serrated blade off of a commie bot by the water treatment plant in the middle of the map where the daily event Ecological Balance begins. 
---
&gt; ***if not implemented carefully with thorough QA***
---
Excuse me, but what? Do you get the impression that they actually test their patches? If anything that last patch, which took the game back to a previous version should be enough evidence that they don't do ANY QA before relaeasing anything lol.
---
Fwiw , Welded Rebar effect is 'attacker takes damage upon successful melee attack'.

Agreed - I've really enjoyed the journey through the main story in 76. Something I really like is that I guarantee I had a different route than you and that's our own journeys through that story. That sounds a bit like "*duh it's open world*" but open world usually let's you go where you want but doesn't always allow doing the story how you want. There's still 1 overseers tape I haven't picked up. Only realised that yesterday and I'll be going to find it tonight. I've joined all the factions... Oh no! I forgot the fire breathers test! Ok turns out I have that to do tonight too.
---
NV is a funny example because that was worse than 76 on release. Damn game wouldn't start and would crash when it did. Doc would have a rotating head, the dialogue was messed up I think, there was something wrong with the special machine too. You haven't left the house by this point. But it's a good game despite the issues on launch. It added weapon customisations and other things that I now expect from a Fallout game.
---
If I'm honest I think the FNV circlejerk over emphasises the greatness of thrme main story though. The side quests are great but the legion story kinda drifts towards the end (from memory). I loved the game world itself though. It had an empty feeling out in the wasteland, like 76. Bethesda seemed to listen to the criticism on FO4 and praise for NV when they made the FO4 DLC. You can be bad in nuka world. You have faction choices in far harbour.
---
I miss cazadors.
---
PC I assume? I get the same if I leave the game window (in full screen) and go to my 2nd monitor in any time, other than when I have the map on.
---
Well LD did say that apprently they extensively test all patches with QA, including whether the SBQ is still a fair fight post TSE nerf. 
---
She wouldn't lie to us. 
---
Shilling the atom store items. Hmm I wouldn't even spent free atoms on that trash.
---
Erm i *think* it was watoga station? I visit that vendor every day as part of my sales rounds but never seem before. I'm guessing that another player sold them.
---
Sorry I don't remember exactly. Run through them all again and that way you can't go wrong. 
---
Good luck!
---
She wouldn't but she can only tell us what they tell her to tell to us. She is not physically their testing things, so how would she know? So you believe that you can roll out a patch like the last one, causing all the problems it did WITH QA? I mean, you start up the game and immediately notice that something is wrong..... 
---
Some other people were reporting that their rifle damage went down by 30-60% after the new update so it was speculated that rifleman was the cause.
---
I really wanted to like the assault rifle. I love the design. But sadly it’s surpassed in every sense by the handmade other than its rarity. 
---
The assault rifle even with the legendary scorched killer attribute and either a hardened or anti scorched receiver still does less damage than a regular handmade with a refined receiver. 
---
As such it just comes accross as a waste of 5.56 once you’ve found even one handmade. Sad really. 
---
Combat rifle again I’d love to like but as a semi auto specialist it and the radium rifle are both outdone by the lever action which competes for the same ammunition.
---
full auto specialists opinions may vary on all this granted.
---
PC same issue. Also reporting humger and thirst seem to be ticking down supremly fast while logged off. I can max out thirst and hunger. Log off for the day, and come back the next day to both hunger and thirst in the red.
---
hey so I know this thread is old, but I love this tweak. Went from 20 or so fps at 1080p on my GT1030 to 40-50 except, there seems to be like a really intense bloom situation? Like the light seems to be quite bright and causes like "light leaks" on the screen. Anyway / idea of how to fix this?
---
Thanks \~Whomas
---
I have no dog in this fight but your comment on reading reminded me of starting morrowind on xbox recently. Damn so much reading I basically gave up. 
---
I never played morrowind and the whole internet told me I have to play it but yeah not going to happen unfortunately.
---
It's a simple equation. 
---
Bethesda: "We need to begin to shift our business model over to games a service before the next generation is launched."
---
Reality: "But won't that be a giant shit show, nightmare of epic proportions that would catastrophically impact the reputation of the company and ultimately tank what ever licensed product that's attached to the project."
---
Bethesda: "Yup."
---
Reality: "So, which title are you going to slap onto this unavoidable burning pile shit you're about to start. Elder Scrolls?"
---
Bethesda: "God no."
---
Reality: "What about your new game?"
---
Bethesda: "Not even going to happen."
---
Reality: "So Fallout, then?"
---
Bethesda: "Well, it is our worst performing I.P, the fan base is some of the most wishy, washy, unpredictable and unlikeable gamer fans in all of gaming. One second bitching about the game, then years later claiming it as the second coming of Christ. Then modding the game with all principle work and assets done and made public. Then rubbing our faces in it, like they are better game developers than us, because they can crowd source drag and drop tool kits, and basic coding to unpaid volunteers. So, yea we could stand to lose them as fans. Maybe they'll all go play Obsidians new game. Do to them, what they do to us."
---
Reality: "what are you going to call this new game? Fallout online?"
---
Bethesda: "Shit no. Fallout and some random ass number. Name it after a Vault or something. This games dead on arrival. We won't make another fallout until the 2030's If ever again."
---
Reality: "Alright. Fallout had a nice run. Sad to see it go."
---
Bethesda: "No. it did not. I Bankrupted 2 developers, ruined the working business relationships of another and all three times we did it, it tanked our stock, drove away investors, and their fan base harassed and attacked our employees. Good riddance."
---
Me too, its the frilly neck that gets me most
---
And the hunters long coat. What a waste of anyone's time or credits getting. There are much better looking free and easy to get outfits.
---
Damn that heck sucks! I actually find a lot of Gatling guns 
---
Congrats bro. When I got my first explosive I screamed like a sissy girl. It's an instigating explosive double barrel shotgun.
---
Like 157 I think he was . Gt is gamer42083
---
Do mistress of mysteries mission ;)
---
If I had to take a stab in the dark, it would probably be that, just like every other energy weapon in the game, it’s damage output is lacklustre, or everything in the game has inherently high energy resistance.  
---
Maybe it’ll feel better once the devs take their promised look at laser weapons. 
---
Hope so, I love the laser rifle design but you feel like a guardsman when you wield one.
---
Try reciting the litany of the lasgun as you shoot. 10/10 commissars agree it helps. 
---
I'm missing the point? Lol you're debating something I didn't say. I think you're missing my point. I'm not interested in debating *how good* the story is. I'm saying *It exists*. There is a story. Your reference to "the story" above implies you agree there is one. Whether it's amazing or terrible isn't something that OP and I were talking about.
---
Happens to me sometimes. Not sure what the reason is but my other addiction (The Division) has a little message that pops up if it detects my connection is not great for that session so I know to expect a slight delay in the actions taken and the server registering them.
---
Again no idea whether FO76 can detect it but a message would be nice if they could.
---
Goddamn it i simultaneously chuckled and got goosebumps from the reference. Thanks.
---
Oouu I haven't done that yet. I need to get a move on.
---
lul
---
It takes an age to reload but it's a fun weapon.
---
See, I don't know if that's the case, which is part of the reason I wanted to start up this discussion. 
---
I haven't done side by side testing to verify but anecdotally the short barrel has less movement in terms of recoil than the long barrelled from what I could see. So you're trading off range for accuracy, particularly when you're rapid-firing.
---
People are downvoting but it's true
---
Yea, I Kinda got over it. I found a better one by chance lol I guess it’s a hit and miss sometimes 
---
i did this put with skeleton costume, instead of being creepy i handed out goodies
---
I don't mean anything specific. Whatever you feel is worth discussing.
---
All benches are tied to your stash no matter if they are in your camp or not.
---
\[TRIGGERED\]
---
In another thread I'm debating there *existing* a main story. I know this isn't the main story but it's bizarre when there's these sad unmarked things to find and people say there's no story.
---
I would like the world to be a little more mate instead of shiny.
---
Metal picnic table and the last bench variant are two I can't find anywhere. 
---
Oh! I had no idea, thank you for your help :)
---
Exactly this.
---
Where did you buy the vault tec beds at, m8?
---
Do forget about the workshop areas that have locked containers and safes that are there whether the area is controlled by another player or not that make you wanted for picking them.
---
Anyone else notice that when you log in you never see pictures that you took in game as loading screen?  That was a really nifty part and now it just loads one picture for ten minutes for me. 
---
If you think that Bethesda don't give a shit about the nigh-universal hatred and disdain for Fallout 76, you're living in a dreamworld.
---
NP man, i don't think it is noted anywhere in the game at all.
---
I found all modern plans in the whitespring resort  at the vendor in the room with the vases. Hope it helps
---
Lol those downvotes. I was just in game where it popped up. Intented to join, but  spent maybe 2-3 doing inventory chores, then it already ended. Looked like coordinated team, no idea what they were using. Im sure it's very doable for normal players as well.
---
They should learn to walk first before they run
---
Proof of what? How am I suppose to get proof of something when it’s gone? What about this suggested to you that I’m lying? Just because you never experienced losing something in game means it’s not true? I’m probably not the only one it’s happened too. I love this game just as the next Fallout fan but I’m saying this game is disheartening when it comes to stuff like this. 76 is a BIG change compared to last. A lot of stuff on their end that still needs to be improved and updated. 
---
Man, you anti-vaxxers are ruining Fallout 76. Just take a Disease Cure. It's faster than making a post on Reddit.
---
You never get level 50 gear though, as Mole Miners don't scale that high.... annoying also
---
The problem is that a lot of these people also don't tell you they have mule characters with thousands of pounds each.. they do a trade  with their character that only has a hundred pounds on them, while their other characters are holding all of the stuff. A guy I traded with told me afterwards that he had 4 mules, while the trade window only showed he had a few TSE guns, the thing I was trading, and basic aid. 
---
And a B.O.B.
---
I find the situation with the handmade and radium to be rather off. 
---
The radium rifle requires more skill in order to craft but the handmade I think does better damage overall.
---
The thing that bothers me with the handmade is that it's VERY heavy. I almost feel better off using one of the others like the combat or radium on a utility weapon or more junk capacity.
---
In terms of the lever action, don't you find the ammo capacity to be too restrictive in a firefight? I tend to use the lever action as more of a sniper rifle.
---
Activate on the terminal im sure you need to access the mistresses private office by giving yourself a promotion on the main terminal that gives you the missions. 
---
Hope it helps
---
My rad worms make me stronger #symbiosis
---
I always have a piece of  Grilled Radstag on me, it's an emergency ration I hit up when over-encumbered, then I can fast travel to the nearest stash. Toxic Valley is great for hunting those . While brahmins in Flatwood is easier prey, it's a good move to let them be for the low-levels.
---

Not affiliated with them btw. Just think it's a cool tool for us to use.
---
Short combat rifle is very effective at close range tho
---
I was told there wasn't plans for the urban scout armor, that I would have youths pieces. Where did you get them from?
---
Have an upvote made my shit an absolutely good time and my shits are typically horrible
---
lol can i have some of what uve been smokin
---
I'm not, I'm replying as you do my original post was just saying no one cares if a noob didn't want your plans. 
---
It's a public forum, did you expect everyone just to shake there fists at the noob for not wanting your plans and circle jerk agree with you?
---
If you feel that's an attack I hate to be the one to point it out to you but you're being overly sensitive.
---
On the contrary, I only take out my flamer and cryolator for the Queen because fuel and cryo cell are extremely expensive to craft. They literally shoot out caps. Mobs are not worthy. And I won't dare to use my gatlin plasma as a daily weapon, cause it breaks too fast. I have to keep it in mint condition for the Queen.
---
"shut up and stop complaining" follows a colon, indicating that it fulfills the preceding description. The subject of the description is "99% of this sub's responses to [...]," where the phrase in the brackets is the list of people you're defending.
---
Since it seems unlikely that this observation would be made by someone who agrees with the standard practice of telling complainers to shut up, I assume that the OP is criticizing this state of affairs. In other words, *he agrees with you.*
---
Next time someone mentions a closer read, (1) take the time to reread whatever you're both discussing, and, (2) accept the offered face-saving out and admit that you didn't read it carefully. Surely that's better than insisting that you just have abysmal reading comprehension.
---
The handmade is pretty chunky. But like most others I have the near mandatory weight saving perks and pockets sewn into my underwear so I have the spare capacity to hold one.  But it chews through the fairly scarce ammo quickly so it’s more of a craps hit the fan gun for me. 
---
The lever action is the counterpoint to that. If I’m being methodical when entering an area then it does the job just fine. I’ve come to see it as almost a long range shotgun/sniper hybrid. At range from stealth it’ll take the head off a supermutant, if I didn’t see the other three that literally didn’t exist two seconds ago and just spawned In behind me then I can back-pedal whilst chunking a round at a time into calor gas canister heads, or quick switch to the handmade.
---
Or at least this was true until I found a gauss rifle. Damn that is slow to fire. But there’s not much it won’t sort out in two shots. 
---
I got the plain electrified blade plan this way, but I didn't realize that the others could drop the same way.
---
If it's anything like in the game, it'll be useless against a vats build. Robobrains cast smoke bombs and you can vats right through it.
---
They'd have to change the current effect for it to make any traction. 
---
However, I do like the idea though. Maybe have it that it can help trigger stealth and in turn sneak attack bonuses. Make PvP less about raw DPS and adds more tactical thinking/planning to the mix. 
---
For now... hopefully
---
What? I didn't say that. We knew since E3. All we had on r/fallout was "*No NPCs muh muh*" in every post before and after release. People that don't know the game know there's no NPCs haha
---
I'm saying: it seems she's alive right now. I doubted that based on hollotapes and I was concerned about the character. I wanted her to survive.
---
I might be misunderstanding and taking your comment too seriously based on your username lol sorry if I missed that.
---
Thanks for the suggestion 
---
With all these bugs, I feel like every perk ive picked isnt actually working, im just too dumb to notice.

This sounds suspiciously like a Fortnite option 😂

You troll, lamely. People don't get to choose when they feel what. Society tells us to bury and hide and suppress emotion so that we can deal with everything about it that's shitty. That's what you do. That's what some of us are trying to stop doing, so that instead we can actually take care of the things that makes society shitty, as it's what is causing us all to feel bad to begin with. You can go on being a "tough hard man" though bro. Have at it. Troll better tho, thanks.
---
\*shakes fist\* that dirty Nike sign!
---
Don't get me started on Adidas.
---
For me the gauss rifle has the handmade problem. Good raw damage but it's just too heavy in my mind to be feasible.
---
Aliens are real! 
---
Alternatively, travel to the golf course, get the ghouls attention, then leg it to the back of the Whitesping. 
---
There’s a hedge next to a bus thingy. Jump on that, then the bus, and you can take potshots at the ghouls whilst the bots take care of business.
---
It's not ok to make jokes like this! You don't know what kind of state people reading it might be in. You should delete this comment.
---
I'm getting tons of blue screens, myself
---
Doing the enclave missions
---
So I did another round of mind numbing events, still no Heavy Combat Arms Schematic. Turn in Technical data, 23 2mm ammo. Nice, that'll get shit out in a paper bag. Fast travel home, get well tuned, and sleep. Douche bags arrive at my house, blow it up, and proceed to tea bag in front of me. What ever, fast travel for some vendor runs. Out of food. Again. Go kill mongrels, cook em up real nice. Ask, what the fuck am I doing with my life. Get off, do literally anything else outside of FO76. Marginally happier. 
---
Do not make jokes that people with depression should attempt to overdose. This may seem like a joke to you, but it might seriously cause someone else harm. You should delete this comment.
---
No reason to go anymore, any weapons that drop get nerfed or have been nerfed. All plans are now at the vendors. The last challenge has been deemed useless by Bethesda. Guns break super fast, guns aren't powerful, its all melee. I'm only playing cause my S.O. still logs in and plays while we try to farm legendary armor. We have both stopped playing nightly due to the nerfs, having to repair everything so often and food and fusion course drain like water off a bridge.
---
Stupid question, but were you definitely not over encumbered?
---
Again, not ok. Please delete this comment.
---
I do!  I love search in ng every town for every terminal and note to piece together what happened to it.  Following Enola Walker's journey was awesome.
---
10 years ago I'd have said the same thing. That was before I started to really care about various people that could take seeing something like this as the last straw before they kill themselves. This asshole up here would say they're too sensitive or whatever, doesn't matter, it's a response that lacks compassion, accommodation and a general sense of caring about others around you. I don't know what you'll say, but I'm not being hyperbolic here. I am a social worker and I work with people who have dealt with so much, and continue to do so, that yes, a hateful symbol that some 12 year old troll who doesn't even understand the significance of what he's doing has the power to cause a severely depressed and suicidal person to finally take action. It does happen, and once is enough. Hate is hate, even unintentionally, even illogically, even if it's an inconvenience to those of us who just want to make a joke. It matters, it has an impact, and if you cant see it, it is because you havent been impacted or havent met those who have. 
---
Like events or the actual missions?
---
RIP fuckthesda
---
Idk if this has been asked, but in F4 we could display our Bobbleheads &amp; Magazines and other collectibles on the appropriate shelves. Can you implement this into F76 and make it so only the owner who places them can pick them back up again? I don’t like carrying all my cool stuff around. Would really like to decorate my Camp with collectibles :D
---
I like to take sniper shots from distance, seeing them look around and jumping amuses me 😂
---
Lol good idea!
---
Turns out it's just when I ult-tab during a loading screen, which sucks. But not the game has an insane amount of stuttering (pauses for 2+ seconds TWICE when trying to turn around, freezes all the time when in combat or doing literally anything, even staying still and staring at the ground) which makes it unplayable. The games so fun, I just wish the made it playable...
---
Really? That does sound pretty cool. Never happened for me either.
---
I don’t disagree. But I found the alternative was being near constantly on the lookout for gunpowder steel and lead to make more .45’s as I was running out of ammo at a hilarious rate of knots doing lower damage, or having to keep multiple rifles that use different ammo types on hand for when one ran dry. 
---
Rifle weight is a real issue, infact weight overall is.  I’d love rad resistance on my brotherhood of steel issue tighty whities but sadly deep pockets are needed for more gun. Because how else can I carry 25 stim packs, my gun, my backup gun, my ammo, my radx, radaway, purified water, 50 cans of dog food, sturdy combat armour, PA Frame, and an entire lowes worth of building supplies stuffed up my ass. 
---
RIP  Tood Hogwarts and Fuckthesda Studios
---
From what we have read/heard about the other vaults, it sounds like everyone in them are dead.
---
I think one had a big explosion and another had a fire.
---
If I dig deep, it's gonna be big news.
---
Must be a PS4 thing. On PC just over the weekend I've seen maybe 4-5 as the quest was starting and all had a group of people rushing in. Usually around 6-8 people.
---
I feel like it would function more the way it does now. power armor is heeeeavy
---
Its hard to know what to belive anymore.
---
Who in the Austin team is going to write this story then? All Bethesdas head honchos are working on ES and Starfield right now. It would take them months to write something compelling unless you want a Fallout 4 rushjob
---
To be fair, huge fallout fans have pre-ordered the game long ago.People should stop using this "huge fan" thing, come on. Plus, you missed on a lot of stuff, you should buy the game, i need people to kill and steal and destroy their camps.
---
Yeah he posted this link up himself like last week 
---
If there is a job where you get paid to down vote what people say about a video game then I need that job. Till then I think you need to get a ton foil hat. 
---
At least until they run out of players that is.
---
its not the servers. its how the netcode interacts with the game engine. it is the reason they were going to do multi in fallout 4 and scrapped it because of these same issues.
---
I'm the same though I've foregone the arm pockets for stabilisers. Makes the sniping head shots such a dream. Probably another reason why I won't got gauss. Bigger, tankier things require more effort to take down but it's a small price to pay in my mind :)
---
33 per hour isn’t two per minute.  It’s two minutes per 1 item.
---
Should take about half an hour to get 16 pieces in your lead collector. 
---
you don't lose caps unless you are fighting back and getting a bounty. I hate bullshit stories like this.
---
I wouldn't say op at 20% dr for 4 points
---
a 20% dmg buff is just 3 points for a weapon! and only 15% in 3 points for bloody mess
---
Yup... sure is. Im one of them.
---
That would make sense. I guess i havent seen turrets in a long time. 
---
Constantly 
---
That is what I meant. Thank you
---
They're not hiring random people. They work in marketing and PR agencies. They have Non Disclosure Agreements. And if you really don't think it's happening, then you're fast asleep.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BWlvnBmIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BWlvnBmIE)
---
you could just not do this. do it in fallout 4 or something. this is not the game for it.
---
Haha I am in AP calc; I'm just too lazy to fill all the different kinds of collectors and was wondering if anyone else had done it yet
---
Fixed it for ya.
---
Next time I will remember to bring some extra padding for your little room of safety. /s
---
SBQ can fly. But I agree when it lands you rip that sucker with All Rise*. 
---
Check the date on the Nuke crypt website. I saw them doing it last week on Twitch with a group of about 4 hitting the separate silos with a bunch of key cards and a long list of possible codes. They deserve a lot more recognition for saving everyone else this step.
---
I belive many dont really care about bobby pins. They just care about crying about it. Give them a reason to cry, and the will.
---
Not zero weight limit. Just impractical for an always online game. They've had to cap the upper max for inventory weight so stash being unlimited is just not going to happen.
---
They've said they're looking into stash increases so hopefully that comes sooner rather than later. Also, hopefully something a little substantial than +200. Would like a little spare capacity for holding some items, maybe collectable rares or a small armoury to allow for different load outs for different events/quests.
---
Yes. Encumbered since beta day 3. Getting constantly downvoted when voicing it. But I dont't care.
---
This is now officially a kindergarten thread
---
Or get rid of the weight limit for a number of types of items you can stash. Stash all the scrapped junk you want and have a reasonable amount of things you can keep
---
You don't have to do the main mission, but you have to look for plans and recipes from all over the world or missions. 
---
Or you can ask if someone wants to sell or give you recipes and plans you need.
---
\*whispers in .50 cal\*
---
You can reload multiple times, do decent damage and still have enough durability to clean up adds.
---
Full set of T-51 weights 80 pounds. It’s less than half of regular human weight.
---
you can buy all of the plans on different vendors but good plans can be really expensive. you can also find most plans randomly in containers all over the whole map, workbenches and such come for free as rewards on the few first quests. so your best option is to buy them and check all of the small containers you find while exploring
---
Weird, I have none of those issues, assume you have the latest gpu drivers, right settings, etc?
---
I fully agree with you man. the game doesn't even DC anymore on my xbox one x. yall kids are so entitled. 
---
Sorry, the events mostly
---
Spoiler to every story: they died.
---
People are claiming that with maxed stealth creatures still detect them. I personally have not had it happen to me or seen a single video to confirm it. 
---
Have you been around since the early days of this sub?
---
White Knight has been nerfed into the ground compared to what it use to be.
---
Upvote for the word play though.
---
Oh yea that’s a good one too! Didn’t think of that.
---
oh..ok.
---
Building plans aren't tied to levels so as long as you can read them you can build anything.
---
There are a lot of great groups around that give other players a lot of plans and material for building cool camps. Also good people to team up and build anything that you don't have.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
If it's .308, super mutants. They also have gunpowder which along with steel and lead can craft you more ammo so double win.
---
When did they say that? Source? I only remember them saying they wanted too but sony wasn't about it. 
---
What?
---
We need an aggressify perk.
---
Better off crafting it, there’s two perks that’ll help. Super Duper and Ammosmith. 
---
Maybe next time actually put some substance in you post.
---
Yea, that’s true! It’s like when you’re overweight and your stash box is full. There’s hard choices to be made when you need to decide what to let go of. Hopefully they will increase weight limit for stashes soon! 
---
on PC, you can edit the texts  and change the message  for yourself if you need to
---
The story is interesting but the delivery is boring. An action loot and shoot were you are constantly stopping to read for ten minutes is a jarring mismatch.
---
I'd be happy if they kept the stash size limit but make junk not weigh anything while stored and just have a limit of how much of each material you can keep. 
---
this sub doesn't allow witch hunting 
---
So, .308?  You have a conundrum early game.  It takes ammo to get ammo.  
---
Get a pipe revolver.  It uses .45 and does some decent damage, so you can burn that while going through Grafton or any northern areas of the forest...Super Mutants.  
---
Later, it’s easier to just make it.
---
&gt; They saved a lot of money by using a lot of terminals and notes. 
---
You don't really believe that, do you? There are so many audio logs and voice actors are expensive.
---
&gt;  NPCs are much more complex to create and voice. 
---
Every enemy is a Non-Player Character, too. Being human or alive is completely irrelevant here. We have plenty of NPCs in the game. Neutral and hostile.
---
&gt; Using robots is much more simple and they can excuse, that they only use one voice actor for that robot. 
---
Like Rose? Even the robots in the game have different voices, you're making shit up. And it's not like every single NPC in previous singleplayer bethesda games was usually voiced in a unique way.
---
It has always been just a fraction of all NPCs and 100 times Guard Voice 1.
---
I do get those issue too, when this occurs, I immediately restart the game because it's almost all the time a warning for bigger issues with the server
---
Just captured the ammo factory. Not worth it.
---
Thanks for the shit post.
---
Well I can't top this.
---
Bump. Want my voice of set muffled ! 
---
PC. 
---
I noticed last time I played a bunch of 100+ level guys came to my aid when I tried to raid a scorched farm wielding nothing but a bowie knife. They gave me loads of ammo, pistols and armor plans. A lot of people seem to be super friendly, it's the main reason I've been wanting to build a nice hangout spot.
---
How do I check? I can't find anything online about it. Only things saying how to update them, or out of date tuttorials on how to check. I don't even know what drivers are.
---
I'll do that! I'm not too big on exploring the areas of the map that aren't visually appealing to me (i.e. all the places that arent lush green/foresty), but I'll sacrifice a day or two to do just that. Thanks! (:
---
I just suspected that their QA exists, but they are just inept. 🤷‍♂️
---
I believe the talk of pve content also being in the March update came as a response from Bethesda on reddit that came about because people were worried the first update was going to be PvP related only
---
Lolz
---
They’re not yours anymore. You booted them out remember?
---
Not so much a specific build but in terms of build advice, but some build tips for an decent all-rounder.
---
I mostly went for a scavver sort of build where I had pretty much weight saving everything to maximise junk/gear runs.
---
In terms of weapon perks, I like going with perk efficiency. 
---
For instance first rank of each of the three rifleman perks give you 10% bonus but every star after than only adds +5%. 
---
Pipe weapons benefit from BOTH rifle and pistol perks, so if you add to that the first rank of the three pistol perks along with the rifle ones, the pipe revolver and bolt-action pipe rifle hit harder and are lighter than their hunting rifle counterpart.
---
Also in terms of efficiency, first rank of Pharma Farma is a must. Anything more than that gives diminishing returns.
---
Also diminishing returns with both Lone Wanderer and Action Boy/Girl with action point refresh. Pick one or the other.
---
ah yes, because the betas for anthem have shown that game is going to be so perfect on release /s
---
I some how have always missed this tape. I didn't even know about it until others mentioned it.
---
If you claim workshops and defeat the first wave of enemies you will get some plans. Make sure to stash your junk because you are open to PvP when you claim workshops. You can claim more than 1 workshop at a time. If you get Contractor perk it will use less resources if you want to actually utilize the workshop and extract resources, beyond just farming plans. You can server hop and claim the same workshop again if you want.
---
Honestly I wish I was fast asleep right now. 
---
Oh I see
---
I think that's just called "meleeing them in the face," I seem to aggressify the guard bots at Whitespring all the time. 😅
---
Are you on Xbox? I got one I can give you for free, if you'd like
---
Bethesda explained plenty of times that they cannot do that at this point, since it puts strain on the server if there are too many items it has to keep track of. They already raised the stash limit by 200 lbs in a patch. 
---
It's best to learn how to maintain your stash as of right now. Don't pick up everything you find, scrap and bulk as much as you can and sell what you don't need. 
---
I've been noticing a few really nice people giving me plans and ammo, maybe I'll continue playing the confused, armorless girl to have a few power armored dudes rush in to my aid haha. The social aspect of Fo76 has been really nice, aside from maybe one person, everyone has been helpful. 
---
What level are you? I went looking for them as well and didn't see them. I thought it might be because I was too low a level (33) for them to show up on the bots list yet.
---
go make another characters and play hundreds of hours. and buy more atoms. ty!
---
I'm fine with the choices. For me 600 is manageable but annoying because I can't be a collector. I sold the Bunker Buster legendary missile launcher because there's no way in hell that I could afford 40+ lbs of space either in my stash or on my person. It sucks because I like holding onto unique legendaries like this.
---
Proving it to other players?  That's a waste of time. It would be better to submit bugs to the developer, and not acquiesce to some user's demands.
---
just note that your chance of actually finding a plan in a container is really small, finding a good one even smaller. so if there’s something specific you want, spending hours on looking for containers isnt really the best option. but it’s good for finding small things like footlocker plans or just other small decorations you probably wouldnt buy or get on purpose
---
&gt;Doesn't mean I can't understand how others like you dislike staring at so much plot through a terminal screen all day though.
---
That's not it. Bethesda likes to go with quantity over quality for most of what they do.
---
For story telling that means you have to go through 100 terminal entries containing meaningless and awful chitchat to find one or two compelling tidbits here and there.
---
It's like reading the bible with page upon page containing nothing but family relations.
---
I think Bethesda sent out the new marching orders: the new narrative of that any part even remotely negative is to be called out as "misinformation" 
---
im sorry if this sounds dumb but what do you mean by you left them stock?
---
If you are playing at the moment send me your IGN and I will try to introduce you to Mr. Plan Man ;)
---
No, I’m on PS4. But thank you though! 
---
Beam splitter is the best route as it increases damage like a multi shot weapon, but it will break almost instantly.  
---
All energy weapons are basically broken, so save one you like and hope the devs fix them.
---
Every damn day my friend :(
---
Its beautiful. Made me wipe away a tear. 
---
You are mandated to build Melee without power armor or you will not be allowed to have fun! Seriously tho I enjoy playing mid range fire support and can't now and hate, HATE playing melee.
---
True, but there are more and more of those people who are bored of the endgame and turn their barrels against the other players. 
---
I have only met nice people and I have three characters one level 172, one 50 and one 38, but this sub has more and more posts about people who have met some real assholes in the game.
---
From time to time I trave to Vault 76 and drop all my plans and recipes that I don't need to the ground.
---
Yeah he can report. Just dont expect a response for the next 4-6 months 
---
There is a very handy and stylish info graphic with all this information. By the same people who made the perk loadable website.
---
It's much more organised to list the effect, and then the food which gives you the effects. Thanks for the hard work OP but I wouldn't go to overboard with your next step when a sleek version already exists :)
---
Which one?
---
See that’s my problem. I am a collector! Lol I can show you my stash box from fallout 4. It’s FULLLLLLL of legendary items and other stuff I love to collect. Fallout 4 made me a HUGE collector. I collected all the magazines, bobbleheads, I’ve discovered every location in Nuka World and Far Harbor. I know there are few places that I haven’t discovered in the commonwealth but for the most part I did. I just liked that I was limitless and I could hold whatever I wanted but I guess that’s unrealistic in an online server. 
---
She was already not all that worth it before the patch. The only reason was if you wanted ultracite plans since there are other more lucrative areas for legendary farming. Now after the nerf it isnt even worth wasting time and ammo for the ultracite plans
---
I would recommend a rifleman/melee build, with some perks dedicated to weight reduction.
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/clDf78Ic36lOg/giphy.gif
---
Fuck ya
---
I haven't seen a single penis base. What's wrong with you people!?
---
Is this in jest or like a legit complaint with the game. 
---
Thank you :)
---
I was going to say that as well. Hell, I don't see why we can't do full management in those menus, drop, equip, favorite, favorite. 
---
Additionally I'd like to tag items either as items we want to keep (beyond the weapon wheel/hotkey and unable to break down) or junk for sale or breaking down. It's getting old trying to keep track of the good items and bad. 
---
Dudes on crack. Was probably the alien blaster and rusty key in the safe. Waters radiated and the dudes looking waaayyy too deep. 
---
Don't drink the water man its not good for you
---
This game just isn't for us collectors and hoarders sadly. We can maybe do a little but I just don't think it's viable to be able to collect all the unique items/legendaries without pretty much throwing out all our reserve junk.
---
The spoiler you mentioned your post isn't actually confirmed. The evidence found is actually to the contrary. 
---
That's really sweet! Us new players appreciate it. I only came across one asshole who just straight up started shooting at my sister exploring a nearby house and kind of followed us around, shooting her every time she came back, but other than that people have been nice. 
---
I just want to own a bar for the tired adventurer to have a drink at.
---
Anthem is going to be dead too bro.
---
As a "played since beta" player I'll go to the Queen if someone nukes her and we've managed to take her down since the latest patch. 
---
I use way more ammo (thanks for nerfing my non-explosive 2 shot gatling BSG) but what else is there to do? Caps? Maxed usually. Ammo? Gives me something to do. Stimpaks? I drop them in suitcases often as the weigh so much and I run events so the drop like rain.
---
At least she's alive when I get there unlike the stacked bobble head dickbag days.
---
This appears to be a issues with the mutations . With the rad worms , all mutations effects seems to be multiplied by 1.5x ( positives and negatives ) and the adrenal reaction seen to be negated . You can check by yourself , you can jump higher with marsupial , your hunger meter depletes a lot faster ( speed demon ) , you have more dr and Er ( grounded and scaly skin ) ... 
---
I don’t know if it’s a bug or it’s expected lol 
---
I still enjoy the game and I even play with a friend pretty much every evening. We always find new stuff to do and get sidetracked and we go blow up entire parking lots with a sledgehammer if we feel like it and it's a blast (pun intended)! Sure, the bad press and the issues the game still has are annoying, but I've got actual problems to worry about. Personally, I don't want to invest time and effort in bashing a game and be upset about how it's not catering to the way I imagined it. 
---
Thank you this sounds like my kind of setup. 
---
Thanks! I'll definitely look into the contractor perk, sounds very useful!
---
I love me some deco items though, so I might just go around looking for them. Thanks! (: You're welcome to have a drink in the bar once it's finally build lol
---
I scored one just on a Legend Goul at the Whitespring. Bloodied 1 star atually selling, will be on the comunity post Ps4 tomorrow Aus sydney time if interested  
---
&gt;here is where I believe F76 is missing the most
---
Fully agree. What's left on this sub seems to be a really disconnected diehard "bethesda sandbox" fan audience trying to turn this game into a singleplayer game.
---
As if that was ever the goal or the reason people are leaving.
---
Not right now, but after college I'll log on for a bit! Thanks :)
---
That was me, pretty much
---
How about a set of stairs that can snap to the side like in FO4 as opposed to in the middle?
---
Theres a difference between expressing your emotions and making others deal with your emotions.  Its fine to express that you find something offensive, but when you expect somebody else to act as a result of your feelings, thats where we start running into problems.
---
I love the world in RDR2 but god the combat is horrid for me. Too much time playing FO games I guess.
---
I think it only effects the drops not the spawns
---
I think it was scaly skin.
---
Thanks
---
Targeting HUD? Uninstall it from your PA helmet, and the blue screens go away.
---
Mine does the blurriness, it was a bug in FO4 that's been carried over.  Latest drivers, PC is only 4 mths old.
---
There are a lot of stability and balance problems that would need to be fixed first.  One of the big ones being that theres no way to completely opt out of PVP since being in pacifist mode wont prevent slap damage or keep others from destroying your camp.
---
&gt;Even in fo4 there was sooo little choice that it wouldnt have mattered if they were advanced terminals (like the major robots) or robots.
---
I don't really understand why bethesda even bothers with fake dialog options and all that. The people looking for rpg-like depth when it comes to dialogue and characters are just getting pissed off and the people looking for the shooter get bored spamming space.
---
Just scrap all that and put a strong linear narrative presented via cutscene there.
---
I'd want balance changes to make more types of build viable and make the process of fighting things less of a slog.
---
Did the bug list for this game get longer since release? :')
---
   
---
people have little patience, especially with one with 90% of things fallout 4 
---
Shot the sherif in the hip then the law had take a stand 
---
Yep, that’s why most of us, who like the game, have moved over to the ‘other’ sub. I still frequent this one as there’s good info when I have a question.
---
Sort of sounds like that 
---
What sub the r/fo76filthycasuals cult sub?
---
Yes, people are claiming a lot of things. I have a stealth sniper build and experienced nothing like people 'claim' are happening.
---
https://image.slidesharecdn.com/atud2-111102181647-phpapp01/95/topic-5-mining-methodspart-isurface-mining-45-638.jpg?cb=1515417680
---
Nope.  I found the water park and then logged out.  When I came back I lost all my 308/38 and none of the meat recipes I made grant HP anymore.  
---
They don't, they only care about the financial repercussions. If they truly cared, they wouldn't have released this shit in the state it was and still is. Alpha-testers for life.
---
Also, if my memory serves me right, this isnt the first time a 'stealth bug' have "appeared", and it was a load of nonsene before.
---
The server though loads your camp way before it loads you
---
First rule of filthycasuals..
---
If the servers can't even handle 24 people...
---
That's how it works. The drop rates haven't changed, just one in every corpses won't release its loot.
---
No, thank you! 
---
I hope you had a great weekend :) 
---
There have been multiple MMORPGs using this engine.
---
Not just online games with a few players and npcs, MMO's with hundreds of them.
---
The Austin team got a raw deal, that’s for sure, but you need to hit the ground running with an ongoing multiplayer game (especially one released in FO76’s state) and fans were pretty generous in giving them time to ramp up. Community managers have been passing on all the bugs/requested QOLs, so I doubt any of the devs browse this subreddit right now. To be honest I doubt they have much time to get discouraged, as it stands! 
---
Quick search said no explaining how to exploit.
---
Umm...
---
As of this post r/fo76 has 3.1k active and r/fo76FilthyCasuals has 63.
---
So not that many moved over...?
---
Well unless you mean r/Fallout who are sitting at 1.3k active.
---
No prob!
---
A major problem is that the game is pretty much built around optimized characters.  If you go subpar, you end up having a bad time.  People ran nothing but TSE weapons and Bloodied Melee because that is what worked.  Those are the builds that keep you from having to burn through thousands of round of ammo and multiple weapons worth of durability on a single outing.  Sure you technically CAN make a pipe guns and leather armor build, but past level 20, you're gonna start getting shrek'd by most enemies.
---
Yeahhhh you’re not wrong, but I’m pretty sure we both know what he was going for. Can’t get those walls tilted.
---
Nope, I don’t think the game is hard enough yet. It’s supposed to be a post nuclear survival, but I’ve yet to run out of food, water, ammo or teddy bears. I hardly ever die anymore, post level 35, and I have more stuff than my stash can hold. 
---
Oh, is that it? Thought it was something about not talking about.. 
---
I saw someone said this already but I can’t recommend it enough, Taking over a workshop gives you a plan and defending it once gives you another plan. That’s two plans in about 30 minutes and a ton of xp from killing enemies. 
---
There were so many plans I wasted my caps on that I ended up getting once I starting taking over workshops. 
---
Remember when converted ammunition factory used to be worth it?  Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
Like I said, those of us ‘who like’ the game :)
---
IMO the 20-30 range can be tough since it starts requiring more mats to stay in top shape, but it's before perks unlock that make EVERYTHING easier.
---
What platform are you on?  Perhaps someone would be willing to group up with you for a bit to help you grind out a few levels &amp; upgrade you gear to get you over the hump.
---
They increase food and water consumption with every patch, without fail. I said it ages ago but you just get loads of idiots telling you you're wrong and can't play etc etc... :-)
---
a lvl 50 one would be a good start.
---
If it’s on a terminal it lore, it’s not story. Rose has the most interesting story quest in the whole game and she’s a friggin robot sending you on fetch quests. 
---
That's fight club. Both start with an f so I understand the confusion 
---
Did you get a bounty because the car explosions damaged the camp?
---
The amount of grey haired, old dudes in that doc was a bit suprising. They just didn't strike me as people who even played a game in the last 20 years and it shows in game. "Mics always on? Great idea!"
---
Ssssshhhh, first rule of fight club..
---
Nazis*
---
Blame people who took advantage of cheeses and stuff, and it doesn't bother them because they are already in the 300's with more stuff than they will ever need. Really the nerfs only hurt new people
---
Dude. Let me translate what you did here. You spent hours playing a game and did not save. The game goofed and you lost your progress. Now let's take in the fact that you could have been raided and your stuff taken and in both scenarios you didn't store your junk which is the closest we have to saving. That's not on anyone but you.
---
Why isn't it worth it? Its free ammo
---
Camp module is not a direct fast travel target, but your fast travel location is a fixed distance and orientation from CAMP module. If you move it your spawn point moves accordingly.
---
Can I cry about something to get reddit attention? Bethesda's 15 plus years of disappointing programming is now somehow unexpected and unacceptable. I have no other games to play so I'll cry and throw a tantrum about how a "survival" game has is buggy, random, and my over powered weapons I spent really money on because I am lazy and don't want to try aren't stupidly good anymore. 
---
Now to be completely honest fallout 76 is a decent game. The content is pretty lackluster tbh for people that want to make this a long term game but it's still pretty early. It's another bethesda title that we can finally play with friends and random strangers which is a nice change. There are plenty of people here that are bored and hoping to do nothing other than ruin other people's experience and that is pretty typical of online games now. With the recent butthurt barage a slowing down of reddit is kind of nice to be honest. I do hope the game improves and that the people here on reddit trying to help get it a little faster on its' way. Otherwise it's same old shit different day here tbh. Just less to bitch about.
---
I don't care about grinding, but I want results! I want to see something for my effort. I grind server hop for over 24 hours before getting a full set of T-51b and calibrated shocks for my Excavator. Grinding isn't a problem. I grind for caps with cap stash farming before this wonderful patch that ruined that. I don't care about grinding. I don't care about difficulty. I care about being rewarded for my time. I care about my time and effort equally some kind of progress/. Not some dumb ass hamster wheel.
---
You know what I noticed since the patch before the most recent one?
---
Every dufflebag I come accross never has *anything* except paper money.
---
They used to have weapons or ammo or something.
---
Now?  I don't bother looking in them anymore.
---
Asta la vista, baby!
---
Crafting ammo takes a lot of steel and lead. I find that the best way to farm both is to visit Camden Park in the Ash Heap region. There are a number of those "traps" which are just jangly tin cans hanging from a chain. You collect these and you'll get like 9 tin can per trap. Each one contains 2 units of steel and 1 of lead, so like 18 steel and 9 lead. There are several of these around the roller coaster, so you can walk away with a pretty decent pile of steel and lead each visit. Do a little server hopping and you can get hundreds of units of each in an hour or so. Enough to craft all the ammo you need. 
---
Fallout 3 was gritty AF. 
---
I believe this is a bug with escape artist it makes u permanently invs unless it's another invisible bug 
---
players cant destroy foundations either.
---
Trick is that's still mostly for vats.  Far easier to just get melee inline with ranged and balance around that.  
---
In perfect world the mag and the legendary prefix would stack directly but, here's link to 2 earlier question thread like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1u8qc/how_does_armor_pen_stack/
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5ip30/armor_penetration_damage_equation/
---
its highly likely that the mag"s armor pen is somewhat tiny % and would be more usefull just to have higher clipsize instead...
---
It's good to know though, the thought of claiming a workshop seemed a bit daunting especially since I haven't really done much other than run around with an old pipe pistol and my trusted bowie knife and everyone in the server was at minimum 50 levels higher than me, so setting myself up for PVP sounded... not fun. But I'll definitely give it a go! Thanks :)
---
&gt;Like I know voice actors are expensive but damn surely there are people in the company that are able to do it for a bonus on their salary.
---
Please no. That's why we get so many awful fetch quests, level designers etc. are doing the work instead of quest designers and writers.
---
Do you really want [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fueYupHwUpM) to return?
---
are people still playing this game, wtf
---
You should look into getting mutations if you haven't. It makes it a bit easier.
---
I enjoy the handmade on the build I haven't shelved due to game changes.  I'm running a handmade with true long barrel suppressed with a medium scope.  Despite the handmade's damage fall off at longer ranges, it lets me get some sniped shots in (stealth build) with tap firing, but nice to have the full auto option up close when being swarmed.  Feels very balanced to me.  Ammo consumption can get to be a bit of a pain, but having a lead camp and running grafton steel and hunting down super mutants in a loop from jail to harpers ferry and other locations gives a good quantity on weapon recycles/gunpowder drops. 
---
You got a purty mouth, reminds me of my sister
---
LOL, yup.  Base was built on a single concrete block/metal stairs frame and had cars underneath the 1st level.  Damaged some floors and exterior turrets.  But at least I answered that question.  Damage by proxy is still damage.
---
That's what I'm trying to determine. If we get enough people collecting data, we should be able to see. I'm on ps4, but I would assume the algorithm is similar between platforms, for this. 
---
I doubt they will ever fix this. It seems more like a engine limitation than a bug.
---
**Dont** "fix" the floating doors plz
---
All builds should be viable, reversing it from melee to ranged ain't balance.
---
Ok thanx 
---
Manta Man is my fave by far 
---
Rad worms make you heal radiation when being hit bu ghouls too.
---
I haven't had loot from SQB last six runs. Fun.
---
Survival games being harder is stupid. 
---
Blame the people who made a multiplayer online game with simple exploits and no way to identify duped items.
---
One way ticket to grind town.
---
I've been rocking Firebreather coat and cowboy hat since I've had it way back. Haven't seen many people keeping that one.
---
It wasn't exactly hard research I was conducting.  I tried with extremely high charisma with Hard Bargain and no grape Mentats, Grape Mentats with no Hard Bargain, and the values were exactly the same.  I also tried with low values of Charisma and having Grape Mentats and/or Hard Bargain, and it did make a difference if one or the other was in use or not (price was lower using both as compared to using only one), so we can safely assume that it isn't how the perk and the drug react with one another that causes a stagnation in price.
---
All the bethesda marijuanas
---
&gt;its a rifle, **big gun** and energy weapon
---
Are you sure about that? I always read otherwise.
---
i wish there was an 'agile' version of the PA. it feels so clunky
---
"Damn, I can’t see fuckin’ shit out of this thing"
---
I know. I had no idea. 
---
Low damage high attack rate weapons suck.
---
The armor system in this game dramatically favors burst damage to an almost comical degree.
---
The ratio of damage to armor determines final damage, and as all enemies have a ton of armor any weapon dealing less than 200 damage per shot is going to be heavily gimped in terms of damage, not 20, TWO HUNDRED is the critical mass where a weapon's damage starts taking a heavy drop against enemy armor, weapons like the minigun are straight terrible, having their damage reduced by a factor of around 7, while a super sledge in it's base form is dealing around a third of it's damage, but with perks can easily reach the point where it does the majority of the actual damage listed while the minigun almost crawls to 1/4.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 47 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 10.6 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.
---
ALPHA is king
---
Edit, food for though, a high level super mutant has 178 armor, so when I say 100 armor, I'm talking mid game trash here or assuming you have decent armor piercing.
---
Armor needs a rework in this game, badly, or at the very least the devs need to understand what armor means for weapon balance. They give higher level enemies more and more armor like a second health bar, making them exponentially stronger and demanding higher and higher alpha strike damage to overcome these higher and higher resistances, if all guns did the same damage per shot this wouldn't matter, but there are weapons like the minigun that struggle against the armor of level 10 enemies but can't be acquired before level 35, as if it is supposed to scratch even lightly armored end game threats, lightly armored in this context being 100 or so armor on the shirtless scorched who are the lowest armor enemies at any particular level, super mutants approach 200 armor, and some of the top end enemies can close in on 300 armor at the top end. Remember, 14 armor is all that is needed to cut a minigun's damage in half, so even giving it 95% armor penetration wouldn't matter.
---
Then there are energy weapons, that don't get armor piercing, have lower alpha damage to compensate the fact that "most enemies are vulnerable to energy damage" as the devs seam to operate, in spite of the fact energy resistance across the board is HIGHER than physical, a honeybeast, which is "vulnerable" to fire and cryo (energy damage) has 132 armor, and 150 energy resistance, those super mutants with 178 armor, they have 300 energy resist. If energy weapons had double the damage output of their normal counterpart they would only be about the same, and in many cases still far worse. Remember, there is nor armor piercing for energy weapons.
---
If you took all the armor off a super mutant, and gave them 10x more hit points then a minigun would kill faster, while a super sledge would kill slower and both would end up about even.
---
The system also makes buffing weird, double a weapon's damage and you nearly quadruple it's effectiveness because you also end up halving armor, which is why explosives were so over the top powerful.
---
I'm going to keep posting this where appropriate until the devs respond that they are aware the way they give out armor makes weapons completely imbalanced.
---
&gt;That was before I started to really care about various people that could take seeing something like this as the last straw before they kill themselves
---
Can't you make trolling little less obvious?
---
My bases tend to never be placeable if autoblueprinted, but I guess I shouldn't be glitching it so much.
---
I guess the glitching wouldn't be necesary if game just allowed me to place arch pieces on other arch pieces whenever I like it to happen.
---
X01 mods are available in the military wing of whitespring bunker
---
Does that include the plans for the armor itself?  Or just the mods plans?
---
If you don't mind server hopping, Watoga HS is also pretty decent, but, if you're farming during the candy event (which you should be for the ghoul spawns), it's a PVP event, so, there's that.  AFIAK, you're relying on the RNG gods to wipe out the one mutation and not the other if you Radaway/decon shower.  If you only have 2, you can at least mutation farm back Marsupial and then Starched Genes and buy the ones you want from there.  X01 mods are purchased from the Whitesprings Military vendor (have to do the quest line and get General rank for access).
---
&gt; hey only care about the financial repercussions
---
I agree, but one leads to the other. This is impacting their bottom line, no doubt about it.
---
There shouldn't be a 'meta', everything should be potent.
---
This sub will come back to life when fo76 goes f2p. Until then RIP
---
Is it a set of mods or is it randomized for each server? I'm sorry, I'm really out of the loop.
---
PS4. Using the brick building set, none of the doors actually fit into the doorway. There's a giant Gap all around the door and it looks like it's floating. Please fix this ASAP
---
See https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/
---
Stealth Archer.... oh, wait. 
---
Random mods when you join, changes on server hop
---
I loved the Railway rifle in FO4, my absolute favourite, was so powerful, could be modded to be long range and it removed people's heads and stuck them to whatever was behind them... it's pretty rubbish in 76 :-(
---
So the consensus is that  **Cloaking armor IS utterly ineffective** ?
---
I went with the Grognak outfit, Ushanka hat and bottlecap glasses. Since melee builds are OP i use only “All Rise” and “Grognak axe” and I just one hit everything that moves.
---
Yeah those Vault dwellers are sure going to tell important story /s.
---
Not to mention to work required.
---
Wow that is unexpected
---
Accounting resources, ammo and meds - it's not free.  
---
To me it does not seem worth the effort.  
---
All Fallout games are simulations. 
---
Or at least the first, second, and New Vegas 
---
You dark motherfucker
---
Is there any reason they nerfed it really? I want to create variety in the wasteland but Bethesda sometimes makes it impossible 
---
But the game still seemed to work when kids were running around with a million weight in their character inventories back when the weight glitch was a thing
---
The gatling gun has an attack rate modifier that works as melee. This means taking the martial artist perk increases it's rate of fire, it also really bugs out the weapon's attack rate stat because it shortens the animation time and generally throws the rate of fire stat out the window.
---
I've also had the weapon bug and fire at the listed 400+ rate of fire, in the most recent patch probably because rad worms, speed demon, who knows really, it lasted all of 2 seconds, but hey it made everything very, very dead.
---
&gt; my over powered weapons I spent really (sic) money on...
---
Strawman. I found my first explosive gun at level 160. I don't mind grinding, but I just don't see much point now.
---
I think of it as shy loot.
---
Look away, look back, loot is either there or not.
---
It’s astounding to me that they have the resource of a sister studio with a successful MMO but they’ve apparently sought zero advice whatsoever on gameplay systems.
---
That was certainly my conclusion.
---
Given the bug backlog, I don’t see this one getting any attention soon.
---
Chameleon death laws are in the game - they look as spectacular as ever! 
---
I'm thinking of farming it, buying is really expensive. Each serum is like around 4,000 caps. I need Scaly Skin, Adrenal Reaction, Speed Demon, Grounded, Electrically Charged, and Healing Factor. I already have a serum for Marsupial, a random fellow sold me it for 1,157 caps. That's pretty hard to farm for all of that :(
---
Wow.

As a TSE user, I'm happy about the nerf.  It was too OP and I was tired of killing myself when playing half-asleep because I tripped over a molerat.
---
Oh okay, thanks for the info! Also is Emergency Protocol really rare and expensive?
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a90myd/proof\_that\_hazmat\_suit\_and\_power\_armor\_has\_hidden/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a90myd/proof_that_hazmat_suit_and_power_armor_has_hidden/)
---
&gt;Power Armor frame has a hidden perk that applies magical effect 'mod incoming spell magnitude' 'multiply actor value' 'power armor rad resist mult' '1.00' (only applied to rad damage, dunno what this does being 1.00 multiply... maybe it adds 1 to the mult so cuts rad damage in half (before armor), need to check data to see if that works...)  
---
need to see what the rads/sec is in an empty frame in a nuke zone (with no other rad resist besides the frame) See if it is 11.64/sec...  
---
hazmat suit should be 0.514 or 0.6 rads/sec from nuke zone depending on if they capped damage reduction from armor at 95% (like in fallout 4) or not...  
---
To get to 95% damage reduction from armor without power armor/hazmat suit you would need \~32780 rad resist (to get to 3rad/sec) in the nuke zone
---
I don't know
---
That's fine, thanks for the help though!
---
Sadly Bethesda’s top priority is to milk the remaining players using the cash shop. How to do that? Make the game PvP so those Fortnite kids can buy skins and keep the cash flowing. The rest of us have to wait and hope they actually pull this out because if they don’t this game will be finished in few months.
---
P.S Sorry for my english, I know it is atrocious...
---
Whitespring farm got nerfed for nuke zones but it's otherwise the same. It's still a good spot to farm xp if that's what you are trying to do. Blackwater mine is a good follow up run after whitesprings and then it's best to hop servers to start it all again if that is your plan. If you are running mutations and the perks for them just drop starched genes when you get in high rad areas to try and get another. Do not forget to put it back on before popping radaway or doing the decontamination run as these will get rid of your mutations. Some XO-1 mods can be bought at the Enclave vendor now. Vendor spawns are fixed now which kind of helps. Happy hunting.
---
So it should work because 4 out of 25 players on a server cheated by exploiting the system? Bad reasoning. Especially since it has been confirmed that those people caused server lag.
---
no problem you english was not the most atrocious thing in your comment
---
It could be a good game, if they fixed the bugs and actually re-balanced the weapons instead of just nerfing the best ones.
---
I farmed caps and bought most of the ones I have, but you can usually find people on one of the big discords in the trade threads or on here that will sell you for less than the science wing vendor.  If you already have the serum for Marsupial, I'd go to the nuclear waste dump NE of whitesprings.  get irradiated, get mutation, there's a decon shower hall right off it.  Get one of the ones on your list, starched genes, clear your radiation and you're good to go.
---
What do you mean vendor spawns are fixed? As in I can't server hop to find different mods?
---
The whole point of this was to slow down the game for people. They said they are trying to pro long the game. People who beat it quickly were left with nothing to do so they slowed everything
---
A lot of people have a hard time because they just have shit builds. You can farm ballistic fiber from military posts/tanks etc.. if your are on PlayStation I’ll help you out
---
Since day 1, yes. I'd say it happens about 1/15th of the time. Are you saying it's gotten even worse?
---
I wish I could find a Dirty Black Suit in the game. Imagine wearing one of those with that hood. 
---
All of the enemies are NPC's too, though. And the world is full of them!
---
I don't think adding some more neutral and friendly ones with some dialog or quests would be that much of a problem technically, to be honest.
---
Legendary hunting rifle? 
---
Dodging those bad prices and horrible salesman lines.
---
Thanks for the info! So basically try to cross one off my list, pop my serum for Marsupial along with my new mutation then buy the rest? Also where did you farm your caps? Really low on them right now.
---
I was walking/running really fast for a bit this weekend.. and my guy can't even sprint anymore due to weight. No mutations at all. It was kindof nice to move with some speed again... then it was gone after a bit. I'm on console, so it was even weirder.
---
Bethesda have sold a broken and unfinished game as a 'finished' product. This is inexcusable. 
---
If you become a general in the Enclave, you can use a terminal in the flip-board room to locate them.
---
Handmade is super awesome. I was running a TSE Gauss pre-nerf, and have since switched to an AAE Handmade. The damage feels pretty similar between the two, which makes the Gauss pretty terrible.
---
Also realizing that the Gauss holds 3 perk points for the ammo -- the Handmade wins for sure. I'm just trying to unlock the med NV Scope! Pretty ridiculous to find!
---
Same start add ESO. Maybe wait a year for there to be more content? 
---
Probably with the luck perk that repairs your weapon.... when you are using a minigun you have far more chances than someone using a hunting rifle or dragon taking 7 shots a minute.....
---
Been there done that.
---
The game has some systems put in place just to prevent easy dick drawing, I see no other justification for why the arch walls are so broken, but you can circuvemnt it by glitching. A protip would be to make inverse walls and then roofs that go out, otherwise with 5 walls height you won't get a dick shape with tower other than 1x1, and to do 1x1 with larger top you need inverse walls. You do inverse walls by placing 1x1, then another 1x1 on each side so you make a cross, then inside-out walls on the center 1x1 then scrapping the outside 1x1's. You can hang half-walls from the outside going roofs at the 4th level of your tower, and then using arches draw the balls below the half-walls. Sb youtube that shit, I ain't a youtuber and haven't seen it online, I come up with that on own in my adventure for phallistic architects yearly prize.
---
Maybe I should wait then lol
---
Lucky you. Tried my first solo launch last week. Killed all the enemies, even the extremely legendary assaultron. Died to it two times, Destoyed all the cores, go the message "proceed to the command room" . And then.. disconnect.  Not sure when i'll try it again. Better to wait for others to launch it,
---
i am still playing since November 14th.....
---
I used the hunting rifle with extra stealth damage multipliers until about level 90ish, until I bought an explosive 1-star pipe rifle from a vendor. 
---
Don’t do it. I play games since the 90’s and never been more disappointed. The game is outdated and buggy mess. More importantly, the devs keep screwing with it and actually making things worse. Just wait few months, it will surely go free to play.
---
i just died, and not in the game, lol :D
---
You misread it.  I never addressed kill times specifically, merely suggesting that a twelve fold increase in kills times might be a little extreme.
---
Of course it turns out that the original poster exaggerated with "seconds" and actually meant 30 seconds so it was only a 50% nerf. 
---
This is awesome. I wish my messed up CAMP budget would allow me to build anything close to this. I've deleted/scrapped everything placed and stored - including blue prints and I'm lucky to have a small shack with a few turrets. 
---
Just build turrets with the resources you get from claiming the workshop, put them in locations where they cant get destroyed
---
no, they were using gambryo not what bethesda forked it into, &gt;.&lt; here is a video explaining the situation [https://youtu.be/jqymg\_prARI](https://youtu.be/jqymg_prARI)
---
I mean, I kind of \*guessed\* that it would, but I NEEDED to know.  Just to be safe, I even shot a car not next to or in range of the structure near as I could gauge it by eyeball, but the chain reaction still counted. It was fun way to get rid of a bounty instead of just AFKing at 76/Flatwoods or just logging off.
---
Thanks for the heads up. It’s a shame cus I like the other games. Maybe they’ll fix it and balance out the issues in the coming year. 
---
Check out [Bagger 293](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagger_293)
---
I’m saying that for over a month straight everybody and their brother was using that glitch and running around with 1k plus weight. So their excuse just isn’t good enough for me.. don’t tell me my stash has to max at 600 when some duper prick is sitting with a million weight stashed on his person causing server instability 
---
Me and my boys harassed some homosexuals
---
Which system
---
8/10?? Are you sure?
---
Yeah they knew the fundamental issues from the start. Their hubris is too great for them to want to make the game something people want to play. They have their plan and chances are what the players want is not in their plans. 
---
I was using the numbers provided by the OP.  He has responded to indicate that when he said "seconds" he actually meant thirty seconds so redoing the match suggests that it was only a 1/2 nerf instead of a 1/12 nerf, again based on the figures provided.
---
I could not agree more
---
Sorry, ps4, now is edited haha
---
Straight jackets aren't rare
---
It is, loosely, if you move your C.A.M.P object around within the green circle, it changes your spawn location when you fast travel, though it's basically impossible to pinpoint exactly where you want to spawn... they need to bring back the fast travel mat from FO4.
---
I thought the Enclave was dead too? At least, all of the politicians and their lackeys... Modus is obviously still hanging around.
---
My impression is that players are going to get to fill in at some point. Modus needs new human lackeys, someone will have to pick up the BoS banner to keep fighting scorched, new Responders will be needed to rebuild, and some folks will need to turn Raider 'cause the other factions weren't going to rob themselves...
---
Also apparently haters go through and downvote everything. (Is this normal reddit behavior? I made an account just for '76)
---
Which platform and what time zone?
---
Last night was bad for me, too, on PS4. I encountered several paper bags that would never stop loading. Had me wondering / wishing a duper had dropped millions of items, and that's why it took so long, but after several standard containers showed the same behavior, I gave up on them.
---
I had my char look at one of the loot paper bags for more than five minutes with nothing ever happening.
---
Not in my experience.  I often walk to the middle of my camp location and watch my stuff pop into existence around me.  It's possible they have already loaded but the graphics take longer but I wouldn't bet on it.
---
I had the reverse water wasn’t draining until I logged out then back in to see my water was red. 
---
not saying it cant have npcs, sure it can, but the issue comes from it being an mmorpg, remember how skyrim was supposed to have a civil war? and how you never really saw it at any meaningful scale? it was because of those limits, and that was just for a single player where the npcs would have only existed in the world within a small radius around the player, the game could barely handle what you did see, now imagine that being on the scale of the entire world having every npc active at all times, and  not for just one person but for everyone  this video explains it pretty well [https://youtu.be/jqymg\_prARI](https://youtu.be/jqymg_prARI)
---
Pretty much, yep.  As far as caps, I farm resources and bulk for vendor sales, sell the odd weapon or two, and have a decent cap stash loop I run with perks on for better stashes while running it.
---
Funny enough, I remember they were supposed to implement CARS in Fallout 2, but had to cut the (unfinished) content from the final release, before modders realized files were still in, and they could fix it and reimplement cars in FO2.  
---
Imagine if back during FO2 developpement, they had a little bit more time to implement cars officially, how fallout games would feel/be different :&gt;
---
I feel like even if this is right, it is still wrong... lol Kinda like a shotgun being 20 lbs.
---
Me after buying the camo Hunting Rifle+combat armor, tracking down a set of legendary hunter's combat armor and trading for a 3* legendary Hunting Rifle: "oh"
---
Wow! You’re the first person to respond with something good to say lol. What do you like he most about and what keeps you coming back?
---
I got my first TSE around level 120 right after the patch. The issue is still bethesda doesn't know how to balance a pve game with pvp elements. I loved my two shot gatling but the nerf was pretty dumb imo. The devs don't understand balance or are being lead to avoid it. While the idea of pvp for 76 is great the implementation has be a train wreck so far. The TSE nerf needed to happen for the pve aspect but it really didn't address pvp's massive flaws. While the changes do push things more towards survival the end game with what bethesda intends is the real question.
---
This is how I fast travel!
---
I think that place (and the town up a tree) are what make me the maddest about this being a bad storyless online game. 
---
Imagine if something like that was in fallout 5 instead? With a real plot and a story and stuff, instead of a weird glitchy workshop event and a few terminals that don't say much and a bunch of random gen mole miners. Like think how cool of a location that could have been in a real game. 
---
Oh, adding those stats would be helpfull.
---
PC / GMT+1
---
Id rather not side track someone working hard to fix laser weapons to then make this more like GTA.
---
I was struggling to keep things repaired as it was before they nerfed producers, I haven’t played much since but I’ve been paying attention to this sub regardless, what they did to feed the people was unacceptable.  
---
Ever wonder why the spinning arrows resemble a yin and yang symbol so much? The engine detects your hurry and does it on purpose, to re-tune you to your inner calm and Zen.
---
-
---
Yeah, right.
---
That's always been fallout, you ever go melee and eat stims or aid by the ton of go ranged and car crit everything 
---
There have been fire rate bugs in the past, perhaps this is a symptom of the latest patchrollbackomgwhateven.  Still advocating for being able to weld a motor to the handle.
---
Find some people to trade it with if you see someone running around using it. I happily trade tons of ammo for scrap and ammo with a decent sized group. 
---
Thanks a lot for the help! I'll be putting this info to good use once I get on later today! This community has gotta be the most nicest community I've been apart of :)
---
Hell no. I think the only thing which is actually worse than 76 at this point is Atlas. Treat yourself and buy a good game.
---
Why do people use "cheese" tactics? Because there are no systems within the game that allow you to grind to get what you want. People server hop to get respawns. Why? Because the mobs don't respawn on their own. And if they do the timer is way too long or requires some convoluted trigger. People farm cap stashes. Why? Because there are vendor limits of 1400 hard cap maximum per day. And no player vending in the game at present if that would even help. People buy duped items because the loot system is just awful. It's a complete lottery. You have however many weapons and armor, and the armors in some cases are split into 3 categories, then with the possibility of 1-3 stars, then the legendary effects. You roll the dice and get trash 99% of the time. Yes it is very nice when you do get that nice item eventually, but the system just doesn't feel good most of the time. So people buy some item that is probably duped and then they have fun in the game. Whose fault is that? The duper has helped that player have fun, and saved them maybe hundreds of hours of boredom, frustration and disappointment. 
---
XP gets nerfed, loot gets nerfed (come on bruh) it's already a lottery and it gets even worse nerfed. I just don't get it. You can have fun in this game running around naked with a rolling pin. Why make the rest of it so tedious and boring, when people could just be having fun with the items they want, not too fast, but not too slow that it would take literally months of grinding and frustration with the disconnects and disappointments with the poor loot 99% of the time etc. People "cheesing" stuff is not THE problem, it's a symptom of serious problems with the game, that they have found these ways to find their own fun and enhance their own experience and side step the frustrations and disappointments and get to the fun part faster.
---
Maybe try playing fallout 1-2
---
Mumble
---
Gramm hated that.
---
You need to find one with the right mods.  I have an instigating Hunting rifle that takes down most enemies in a single well-placed shot.  
---
as a further example, remember how the robots at whitesprings used to spawn endlessly till the server crashed? its a perfect example, the server could only handle about 154 entities before it would crash it is / was due to the limit of the engine to address enough ram
---
Having never played a fallout before this one, I enjoy a lot and even bought fallout 4 to play because of this one.
---
No I'm fine with it, really.
---
The vendor spawns don't change now. XO-1 is only in the bunker. BoS armor mods are now at BoS vendors and so forth.
---
(1) I have always been a huge Fallout fan.  (2) i think the map, backstory and detail is well-designed.   I like the exploration aspects.  
---
Do you have any friends online? Leave your stuff in any box and relogin with your alt to the same server. Be careful and hidden of course, do not transfer any good things like 3\* weapons.
---
I have and that’s why I was interested in possibly playing 76. I’ve played them all so far except this one. 
---
I agree with you on the Enclave technically being dead. But MODUS wants to remedy that by actively drafting you (and other vault dwellers who come that far). With MODUS still in place (and with the VD aiding them), the Enclave can actively win back the wasteland. As for the Brotherhood: Would there be an incentive for VDs to take up the banner, especially if there is no more connection to Maxson? I don't mean to criticise, I'm just trying to understand why people would want to reestablish a faction with a de-facto dead leadership. As in: "Why would I do what this Maxson guy wants if there's no chance in hell that I'll ever meet him?"
---
I imagine it would be more likely for VDs (and other survivors for that matter) to use the technologies left behind by other factions and establish something new. 
---
And yes, there will be your fair share of Raiders, but in terms of power, they'd still be inferior to what the Enclave already has. 
---
I have multiple accounts on multiple pcs, so I can watch both ends. Your camp loads in pretty much immediately, right as soon as you click on join world. For the person loading in it takes another minute or so. 
---
Everybodys off thats the reason haha
---
does it mess up the damage on laser rifles, gatling lasers etc, or is it just gauss rifle? it’s probably bugged, i havent checked my gatling laser damage differences because i’ve had grounded with class freak 3 for a long long time, but i havent noticed any major difference so it might just be a bug on your character specifically
---
Ok, looks like most containers are three days and the chem, first aid, and safes are four. That is what I saw on both systems on my test, the Overseers' caches, lockers and such in the locations I hit had respawned on my third day but the others were an extra day. 
---
You mean a minigun?  If they’d buff it a tad, you’d have your weapon.
---
It isn't going f2p anytime soon.
---
This is what I’ve always liked about the games too. Is the story in this one good? 
---
Your nameplate also appears while you're still on the load screen.
---
I mean, I won't tell you all my money making secrets (it's free real estate), but generally happy to help.
---
That’s cool, I love Fallout 4. How’s it compare so far?
---
Vault full of time traveling synths please!
---
Don't you think that actually adding new content, instead, could be a better solution? Turning new players(and vets) away from this game is not a way to slow progress. It's a way to stop it permanently.
---
What you call shot builds are the way they want to play. Build diversity is good. Bland copies are bad.
---
The engine is way older than 2015. Same engine since Skyrim.
---
in my fallout guide book it says big gun...the name says rifle and it uses energy ammo lol
---
Am I wrong?
---
Haha this seems to be the majority of the opinions lol
---
Clear and straight to the point. I like it 
---
&gt; Every enemy is a Non-Player Character, too. 
---
This is were we see, that you don't have a clue about that stuff. Comparing a hostile NPC to a story NPC and creating a complex scene with animations and scripts.
---
I like that idea. This would also make bullet shield more worthwile.
---
Yeah, that sucked. When you dump that many thousands of rounds into something it should die. Mini nukes feel like they are worthless against her, and even the orbital strikes people were calling in on her barely touched her health.
---
You thought. 
---
Also workshops have a fast travel target you can build but not camps. 
---
Way to have a way to do something about it but not Bethesda RIP. 
---
Yeah the problem was the beta was like 2.5 days long total or whatever which isn't enough time for us to break their game proper, so they could fix it proper for release. Now they're in damage control, so everyone has already gotten tired of bugs and lack of stuff to do after they've completed all of the main and side quests. Waiting for new content. 
---
I've been taking my time, but even then I only lack launching a nuke at this point, then what? Farm? No thanks...
---
That's because you're a close minded individual who can't see outside the box or look to the future.
---
Now that you mention it...
---
That's a relief to hear, almost gave me a heart attack. I'll be farming for a while still though. Also do you know if the mods are expensive? For example, Emergency Protocols is one I really need for my build.
---
I'll take what I can get, better then nothing. But again, can't thank you enough.
---
No, It is not worth it. Wait a few months and you will be able to get it for free.
---
In Fallout 4 it would've been just another shooting gallery without any kind of functionallity or interesting NPCs... maybe a settlement place nearby... a missed opportunity like so many cool locations in that game.
---
I hope Fallout 5 will improve drastically on Fallout 4 and F76.
---
It appears that you've been sufficiently answered by other users but I can add this; if you can give me the mats I can make the Serums for you.  Xbox, by the way.
---
AND HARPOON GUNS!!!
---
If you take the time to read the terminals and listen to the holotapes then yes.   There are essentially no NPCs, but the story gets told by archaeology—reading and listening and viewing things from the recently deceased.  
---
If the minigun had the same dmg/shot and boom boom boom noise.  I live for the simple things in life.
---
This is exactly what I was afraid of. I hate the idea of it turning into wow and just farming and trading all day
---
Gauss rifle gets bonuses from rifle perks, but uses energy ammo, but also will take a debuff from grounded mutation (+energy resistance -energy gun damage) weird. 
---
The last patch fixed it, it’s now taking from bulked supplies again.
---
I don’t mind reading at all. I grew up with jrpg’s so it’s no biggie 
---
Thanks for the offer but I'm on PS4, if only there was cross play. Hope someone with the recipes of the mutations I need read this, make my life much easier. 
---
What I really can't wrap my head around is how they fucked up balance this badly. All you need to see how terrible heavy weapons and energy weapons are is to take a look at their raw stats. I mean, you can just pick one up in game and even a noob to the game will immediately see that its rubbish. There are no secret modifiers that magically make them better. Even a specialized build with the right legendaries makes them barely ok. Just how? And they could have used the last few patches to implement atleast some changes and see how they work. But instead all they did was break the game even further. Incredible.
---
It's more survival based, so you have to monitor food and water. The camp system is similar to settlements, but smaller. And a lot of the junk you would pass over in 4 is absolutely necessary to pick up in 76. 
---
I like the 76 map better, but sometimes I have to play 4 just for the npc interactions. 76 was very lonely feeling when I first started, and still is since I mostly do solo things. 
---
I also waited a bit to try it because of the reviews, but I'm glad I decided to play it.
---
That’d be awesome haha
---
Or perhaps make vendors have a maximum of 2000 caps and every 20 hours they add 200 caps
---
It is the vendor in Pleasant Valley Ski Resort. Go in the building and go up the ramp to the second floor. Through the doorway you will see a set of stairs that go down a level. Go down and he is there. He will sell all the plans.
---
I’m ok with the burp (I worked on Vulcans in the Army), but the damage is just not worth it.
---
Dropping collected notes are funny. In the Flatwoods funeral home there’s a not called “I’m Sorry, Daddy”
---
Would be good but this game is a sinking ship. No amount of post-launch content can save this game. Go uninstall the game and use the space for a much better game. 
---
No joke i got it first try yesterday on ps4
---
Yeah, it really sucks that this is the situation. It's funny to watch the train-wreck that surrounds 76, but at the same time, it's a bit sad.
---
I got it with puck 7
---
When people talk about the main "story" in fo76, they are using that word very loosely.
---
Can’t upvote this analysis enough.   
---
Omg same lol 
---
I think at this point, they're not really making a profit from new sales anyway. Game's 10 bucks. They probably got a good haul from the initial sales and preorders, and are now looking for a way to put this dumpster fire in its grave.
---
Have u seen mini gun plans ? I wonder if they exist. Ty

I’m torn because some of the things I’m hearing I really like. For instance what you mentioned about survival was one of my favorite aspects of 4. But then I hear other things that make me hesitant. Guess I have a decision to make.

I can help, I have to stuff to transfer as well. Hit me up on PSN: R-C-MAN

I've been playing since BETA.. 150-200+ hours in.. still loving it. I did finish pretty much every quest available, but I still exploring (even though I found every single location. Even after this much time, I'm still finding some little easter eggs and funny scenes here and there. If you like the other Fallout and Elder Scroll games, this is more of the same.. just online. Some of the bugs are very annoying and/or frustrating, but you will get a ton of hours out of the game. I'm more of a casual gamer now than I ever was before, due to adulthood, but still find that an hour or four a night is still fulfilling...

I want a jet pack 😞

I think a new dlc area that’s free would be cool. I had a idea for a area like the toxic lake from fallout 4. It would be an area filled with a new type of enemies that has been exposed to so much radiation they turn out to higher levels and there’s constant radiation in the air. Also power armor would be a main way to survive. I think it would be like a old military air field with a big lake next to it. The lake would be filled with super toxic water. Maybe 50 rads per. Then there could be like level 100-120 suggestion level. If you nuke it it could spawn like a behemoth death claw breed of death and could have more aspects then just whaling on it like having to use other devices from different missions. Idea could be you have to use the phantom device from the mysterious side quest to sneak into a area to blow something up leaving the death claw on its stomach to do prime damage. I think a death claw boss would be the way to go though
---
Most plans for weapons and mods double in price but you can still find the mods themselves occasionally for much better prices. I've seen the protocols mod at the bunker fairly often lately but can remember the price.
---
The ultracite laser pistol has a lower base dmg than the regular pistol so even if it applies the extra dmg to SB then it might even out with the regular laser.
---
Praise the worm! What was will be!
---
I just want to live the dream of sailing through the air in X01 with jump jets from a cliff face pretending I'm an A-10.
---
Totally agree because I love Fallout but what’s happening with this game really is kinda crazy. 
---
I have 4 points in because I somehow made a rank 4 Wastelander card. Same stats as the 3 though. It makes me sad inside though. I want to put it in luck or str
---
Not really, they have projects aside and they have TES6 and Starfield in the work.  
---
Fallout 76 is a realworld test for BGS, they've no expertise in MMO, let alone simple "MP" games. They can afford pushing a broken game, taking their time to fix it, push broken patches and fuck up their rebase / merge / upstream workflow, they can take Xmas holidays while their planned AtomicShop items are auto-published.  
---
We're pretty far from a "final fantasy" and praying for the studio not to shutdown.
---
just tried to fast travel somewhere but the game froze for around 40 seconds when the loading screen dissipated, and when it resumed I was dead. There goes hours worth of scrap.
---
I understand that some don't like it, but how is PvP equal to griefing?
---
Is it a good single player experience?
---
The plans and serums were never meant to be easy to obtain. Now there easier than they were before because u can just buy them there all available. The whole reason for the huge inflation on plans is if a player buys them he can now make serums and sell them to players for a reasonable price then rinse and repeat to gain the other plans. Just because you think you should be able to obtain the plans easy in 1 day doesn't justify saying oh its to hard now i need to cheat. Not everyone here wants everything handed to them its the whole point of the game to play not "lets get everything so i can become one of those guys that post on here saying i have nothing left to do"
---
The "stories" in the terminals have zero impact in the world though. It's just "let me read this for 10 minutes to find out how random character I've never met and will never meet died". The stories aren't fun when you already know the conclusion is "they dead".
---
Agreed 100%
---
That's good to hear then. Thanks for the help!
---
I just tested with a plasma pistol and it's the same, Class Freak doesn't lower the negative effect of Grounded on the damage of the pistol. 
---
Agreed. Even in the 30s can be very hard.
---
Now watch some genius go do this but as Jack
---
Yea, just use melee. It’s much better and much more rewarding as you don’t need to shell out steel and lead for nothing. You can literally outdo an Assault rifle with a board.
---
Luck does not affect drop rate or quality. It only effects the CND that you find items in
---
No,the point to a build is to make sacrifices, reducing the number of special points of perk cards would make people OP. Then we have a new round of people foaming at the mouth for that to be nerfed.
---
He didn't say he soloed the queen. He said he beat it, but there's no mention of whether it was with people or not. It's extremely unlikely that he launched a nuke at fissure prime and no one showed up for the queen. 
---
I use a one star anti-armor hunting rifle for PVE where time isn’t a constrain and when I am low on any other ammunition 
---
But yeah, scorchbeast and combat in the open is pretty terrible with a hunting rifle 
---
Ok 9/10
---
There is an occasional glitch with strange in numbers where all it does is suppress the positive mutation effects instead of increasing them so you will only be getting the bad ones which are boosted you need to take it off and reset your game.
---
No your just making an ass of your self assuming for one. Most people don’t use 9/9 of your dmg perk cards like rifleman etc. they use 3/9 for example. Builds where you’re trying some hybrid shit and complain that it’s not working. Where you went more into inventory management instead of raw damage.
---
You can buy Excavator mod plans from Camden park vendor
---
The plans sometimes drop when doing Patrol Duty.
---
Very constructive response. Good job dumbass 
---
I sent u a request
---
Consensual PVP isn't. That is where both parties are engaged and have fun.
---
A level 200 chasing down the same level five over and over that is just trying to do the starter quests and blowing up their little wooden box camp is griefing.
---
Extreme but valid examples of things I have seen.
---
Pipe guns do not suck with the right build.

I started the day it came out. Quit after the last patch. Would recommend holding off until they get their ish together if they ever do. It’s a kick in the balls grinding for months to get the best gear and all of the sudden their useless. Also, there’s not much to do once your at a higher level. Scorch beast queen doesn’t give very good loot and you end up spending more materials via repairs and stuff then the loot that’s dropped is worth.  
---
Yeahhhh, no. I'd rather have actual proof before I go and potentially waste my time looking for something that may not exist
---
it's ok, if it can give people like Machea96 some motivation to move far away from FO76, that's fine.  
---
Let the kids gtfo, hit or miss huh, I  guess they never miss huh.
---
&gt; We're pretty far from a "final fantasy" and praying for the studio not to shutdown.
---
Yeah, I know. Literally no-one here was saying that. I'm just saying that Bethesda ARE taking notice of this situation. There is no way they "don't give a shit".
---
I'd do it the other way around nerfing the weight/dmg cards.
---
Definitely the best way to put it. I have compared this game to Diablo 3 several times and will do so again: eventually, the grind should pay off. I am perfectly willing to spend hundreds of hours getting EVER SO SLIGHTLY better until eventually there is a discernable improvement. Hell, take Skyrim's skill grinds as an example; do you know how fucking boring it is to level Block?
---
But here? Nope. Bethesda just finds how gamers are enjoying the game and then yank away the carrot.
---
At this point, I feel confident saying that Bethesda IS VaultTec.
---
PvP can be non-consensual and still not involve griefing, though.
---
Only 24,999 caps in Watoga...
---
How’s pvp?
---
Was doing an Enclave event just now. It was just sitting there, some distance away from that robot stop that I was protecting. Went running towards it. once I got close to swing my axe it just stood up, turned around and launched like a frigging superman. Leaving a glowing flare and a puff of smoke. Was awesome. 
---
I will agree to disagree.
---
In the past I have seen a lot of players selling serums at a decent price so the high vendor cost continues to encourage that. I would love to see more vendor caps but can understand the pricing.
---
&gt; Just because you think you should be able to obtain the plans easy in 1 day doesn't justify saying oh its to hard now i need to cheat. 
---
I'm not even remotely close to suggesting that. 
---
I'm not expecting it to be easy. However, for a casual player, it's just a pipe dream to own even a few serum plans, let alone the whole collection.
---
I don't necessarily have a problem with the price inflation. I get why it happened. I more have an issue with the artificial cap supply restriction on the other end of that equation.
---
Yes, in my humble opinion. And while the social menu system is still clunky (though improving) you can move seamlessly between co-op and single player. Just show up at an event and use area chat, like real life.  Spend the rest of your time alone (there's even a perk card for that).
---
U online now?
---
To be fair, it takes a much longer time to create new content than it does for players to complete and get bored with that content.
---
76 was the straw that broke the camel's back. Modders have fixed previous Bethesda games and forms part of the reason why people didn't give Bethesda a lot of flack. Strip away the content, asset-flip a previous game, have stuff all of a story-line, don't let modders fix the game, and the end result is a fucking shit-show. a.k.a 76.
---
 And you actually have to ask why people all of a sudden have a problem with Bethesda's bullshit approach to cobbling together videos games? Really? Well the answers right there bud. Just gave it to you in the first para.
---
The game is easy mode anyway, harder is nice. Need a challenge.
---
It's annoying having to grind more but meh. 1 shotting everything was boring.
---
No sorry will be at 5 EST
---
Found this problem too. I found an easy fix: just talk to the terminals a couple times first. MODUS will rattle off his introduction to the terminals but it should work while he does that. 
---
One of the reasons I shelved it, I came in a bit late just after Christmas and I can’t do most quests without server hopping because high levels wander in and scale everything. When you’re level 24 and the enemies are 60+ it’s a bit pants.
---
Coolio pic
---
I hate scorchbeasts with a passion. I've only fought two so far and I never want to deal with another. 
---
Maybe. At least then it won't feel as bad if you miss out on a few days of play and miss out on the cap earning potential.
---
When I was around your level I'd have to farm the forest for loot almost everyday. That and server hop for ballistic weave. 
---
Now I spend time trying to find fusion cores.
---
This way we don't change the values, just the perk points required. If Bethesda feel the need for a balance changes (like what happened in Demolition perk, or White Knight) then they can for for it.
---
It has its flaws but if you want to know how it is you should just get it used from Gamestop.  Try it out for a few days if you don't like it you can bring it back within a week of buying it and get your money back.  It's always better to form your own opinions instead of relying on what others say.
---
Cause Armor is garbage in this game. It almost wants you to use a melee because it has super high burst damage and extremely good armor penetration, even if you don’t use and AP mod.
---
Lasers would be extremely effective if the game was actually like it should be and things have 300 times less energy resistance.
---
At level 30 you should be able to kill a level 5 super mutant in a single shit with a decent rifle.
---
I think many people's problem is they aren't crafting new level weapons.  Remember, that Gun you picked up at level 5 is crap at level 30.  And you can create a new gun, same one, at level 25, with higher base damage and mods.
---
Also, invest in the Armorer Perk, it will remove Ballistic Fiber from crafting requirements up until max level.  A must for low level gearing up.
---
Pick up all steel, lead, and cloth/gunpowder you see.  Crafting your own ammo will solve all your ammo problems.  Steel and Lead are so abundant you get to the point where you either have to drop it all or (better yet) craft it all into ammo as soon as you can.
---
My teammates struggled in their 25-35 range, but once they figured out you can craft new versions of all your weapons and armors every 10 or so levels, they went from always dying and running out of ammo to being powerful enough to slaughter most everything they ran into (unless it was super high level stuff spawned by another player).
---
And at level 30, even an unperked melee weapon will make short work of all that low level garbage, allowing you to restock supplies for only the cost of repairing a sword.  (Maybe do the Top of the World and get Black Diamond, or Mistress of Mysteries for Blade of Basset, which are really nice even unperked).
---
I'm finding it a ton of fun, but it's probably not a good fallout game. Having other players doing goofy things along with the radio and such gets rid of the atmosphere a bit, turning it into a trek across the country instead of a wasteland. Combats fun, exploring is fun, grouping up with friends is fun. Quest's are pretty bad though, and it runs horribly to the point where I cant even play it anymore.
---
If you are on the fence about it and „WANT“ to play it, just buy and play it and nothing anyone says will or can stop you 
---
But if you need to ask, the answer is „no“ 
---
Hit up the trading subreddits.  The market value on Serums is so low you could probably get every mutation you want even without providing the mats to craft them.
---
Thanks, for all the effort to help get this game fixed.
---
It's unfortunate that Bethesda seems more interested in adjusting (and messing up) things that are not broken, than they do in fixing the things that are.
---
It can’t go above 1 Star. Also no, it counts.
---
I've killed the SBQ four times, including nuking fissure prime with my group. I've never been able to get loot. It's always just a blank loot table. No spinning arrow, nothing hidden in the transfer tab, just nothing. So I've stopped trying. 
---
A. Try stealth for extra damage and do some research on good perks to take for the build style you want to go with.
---
B.  Maybe set the game aside for a bit until they get their shit figured out.  I have three characters that are over lvl50, but I'm done for a bit until they get more of these bugs worked out.  I bought the entie Kingsom Hearts franchise and am going to work my way through that instead.
---
Non existent 
---
Except then you have even some dedicated builds that can't hope to ever match some others. Explosives in general even before was just servicible, now its straight up shooting yourself in the foot.
---
I'm level 60 and still roll with Deep Pocketed Treated Heavy Leather everything.  I'm not switching to Heavy Combat until I find Deep Pocketed mods for it all.
---
I ran Deep Pocketed Heavy Leather since level 20.  Rank 2 Armorer perk removed the Ballistic Fiber requirement and then I just scrapped it and crafted new stuff once I needed to repair (repairing still cost Ballistic, but perked crafting did not).
---
Preston is ground zero
---
i don't understand the block option is there, but you want to make the block option easier? It takes no time to say ok ignore then respawn and block. by adding a 3rd option to block your basically encouraging someone to block. In all my hours of gameplay i haven't seen where griefing is so prevelant to justify an added block option after you die.
---
If you can buy it for around 20 dollar why not I say, but DO NOT expect a finished game. This game was released in a state that more resembled late stage Alpha or early beta. It has the potential to be great but has so many problems right now that getting to up to OK will take at least 6 months.
---
Devs seem completely out of touch with community wants, and their vision for this game appears very disjointed.
---
Here this is a long review but 100% spot on, and really should give you an idea of what your buying:
---
https://youtu.be/MlfRhpOy6Yc
---
It's never going to be f2p, let this idea die already.
---
1) no, only if it's a weightless legendary
---
2) it probably would, chameleon pieces stack, or at least they used to in Fo4
---
3) shrouded is just a mod, it can be applied to legendary wood armor as well
---
addendum: the heavier your armor, the less sneaky you are. wood is the best stealth armor in the game.
---
another addendum: I believe speed demon is bugged and negates any speed bonuses other than itself, so you won't be sneaking faster.
---
That's up to Bethesda to decide, my suggestion is for reducing the perk requirements not the values.
---
Right, okay so I know how 4 points freed up from perception because my 9 in rifleman went to 5. I can't run Serendipity because I only have 8 luck...well shit now I have enough points left for that and more. See that's what I mean by OP. 
---
Much, much worse since last patch.
---
Have you looked at your own post history? 
---
As far as I'm aware, no different than before i.e. they're definitely going to look into it but no new info outside of that.
---
Steel (10)
---
Aluminum (5)
---
Fertilizer (3)
---
The main problem is that they make it harder for the levelling characters. If you don't have a really well planned out optimized build you're screwed. Then suddenly you hit level 45 or so and the whole game becomes very easy
---
I sure rather see something like this instead of another durability nerf.
---
Bullet sponge enemies + weapon durability + limited ammunition 
---
Not seeing improvements any time soon to this formula 
---
This was a joke if you get that butthurt for a joke on the internet well I think you have a problem 
---
Everyone should not have to min/max the newest Meta to enjoy this game. I want to play a not VATS rifleman, and by Moth, that's what I'm playing until I get tired of farming lead and fiber.
---
Yeah sure but it will open up space for more builds and diversity isn't it? It won't be totally OP, cause then Bethesda can do a Balance pass on those perks.
---
I constantly here about people hiding in the shed, but the one SBQ fight I was involved with was when I was trying to do belly if the beast (thankfully the nuke didn't cover the entrance), and was thus stuck sniping her from a ditch far to the east because i was too afraid to run across the open ground to where the fight was.
---
rad worms is breaking mutations
---
This is fine
---
I don't even care
---
I respect your point of view.
---
For me, yes. I've only grouped up twice the entire time.. and sometimes, I just join in the killing of enemy hoards, then go about my business. You will see and hear that people have issues with pvp and "grievers", but I've only had 1 bad experience the entire time.. and the guy gave up, because I didn't fight back. I put on passive mode so that I don't accidentally shoot someone to initiate pvp, and I'm good. On Xbox, I find that people are extremely friendly, and willing to help. I've gotten a ton of free stuff, a ton of help with missions, and I've also done the same for others. I build my camp where it is beneficial for others, and usually get a wave of thumbs up
---
Until the nerf that too. Which seems inevitable at this point.
---
I fought to by myself last night and watoga. Better state of the forest if you're wanting to see very few Scourge beasts. If there was a counter I've probably killed over 200 by now. The queen has died with my hand being involved at least 20 times.
---
I had a SB land next to me the other day. He did not even see me just sat there.   So I shot him in the head with my dragon.  Almost killed him then he flew away and sprayed me with the mist.  Two scorched appeared and both hit me so hard I rag dolled into the air like the skyrim dude getting hit by a giant. Once they have fixed alot of the issues. This game will rock.  I hope they fix armor soon.  
---
No, builds are suppose to be a sacrifice, if I can do and have all, there isn't much build diversity. What you are calling for would actually decrease build diversity. As everyone would have the same damage perks and same QoL perks.
---
Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this. 
---
I really wish I had a better answer for you, but I honestly didn’t get any playing time in between the Patch and the Hotfix. Therefore, I can’t tell you which one triggered the abnormally-quick consumption rates.
---
I’m positive about the water consumption being faster, with no diseases/mutations/perks. I’d be happy to test it to see how long it takes to go from 100% - 10% if necessary.
---
Thanks for looking into this!
---
Isn't stealth very bugged right now?
---
o\_O vert der ferk?
---
A pseudo conspiracy theory that's been going around is that the decision for no-NPCs was more about server strain than a design decision, as walking talking NPCs that don't just stand still like the vendor-robots would add a lot of strain.  A lot of things seem to be this way and there's a very stark difference in how the game performs at large on an empty server vs a full one.  I suspect a lot of the game's 'poor design decisions' stem from this problem, it really looks like they had to trim a ton of stuff just to get the game functional.
---
So if that is true, and honestly it really seems like it is, the vaults **cant'** give us new human NPCs for the same reason they couldn't previously - too straining on the server.  Likely the engine is horribly inefficient in how it handles network data and it just doesn't work well, they'd either have to drastically increase server capacity something like limiting servers to 12 or fewer players or doubling their server costs which is a scary thing to do for what is essentially a dead game.
---
Hi Bethesda I was wondering if you could add weapon mods to power armour/gadgets like your  power armour aluminates in dark places I think it would be a really good idea for future DLC and maybe even fallout 5 the fans and me would really like it and continue to support your game despite all the glitches
---
My cores drain rapidly too, but at least I have an excuse for why: Speed Demon mutation. Even with 10 points in Endurance, it drains pretty quick. Which is why I have Good Doggy, 2* Cola Nut and a good supply of both.
---
Well... Wait.
---
It's like... 7k for a t60 or less jet pack plan isn't it?
---
Still not the X01
---
I also thought giving stuff to everyone on the server was the point.
---
Weight perks are fine at 3 but I do think 9 is a bit excessive for damage perks, 5 seems a bit more reasonable.
---
Yeah, I'm still on the Heavy Combat plans grind... got chest and arms, still want legs. I did get the chest plans from the technical data, so it is possible. I'm guessing you're on the same BoS event circuit as I am, but just in case you're not -- grab a weapon with a recon scope for the Distant Thunder event. (It can be any weapon; you just need to look at scorch through the zoom.) Gets you better loot than just killing the scorched.
---
Imagine if you just loaded into a new server 
---
And I will agree to agree to disagree.
---
Right there with you 
---
Same one here, I keep that thing on me all the time for an opener or closer.
---
I think what I learned from this thread was the killing wendigos is fun, so I went and melted the guy in One Violent Night with a plasma thrower. 
---
5 stars, would melt again.
---
I was saying early on that it's a poor decision not to have a respec because future balance changes and tweaks will inevitably leave people feeling like they have a ruined character.  That being said, I don't think things like White Knight are less good for two reasons.  A) **very** few perks are actually good and worth using so there's not much comparison and B) perks like White Knight aren't 'good' so much as *necessary* to play the game.
---
Another problem is a general lack of damage scaling more or less forces people into crit builds now which is pretty shitty but honestly the entire perk system is a sham and they just didn't think through how important character archetypes would be to players.
---
That’s fine and no one is saying meta. You don’t have room to bitch though if you waste points getting perks for melee and you use  rifles 90% of the time. Get your damage cards for your chosen class of weapons maxed. If your gonna sneak get the sneak dmg cards. Get bloody mess they have ways to increase damage. 
---
That’s my point you don’t have to run low life builds or vats to have a build that kill things. Is bloodied faster? you god damn right but you sit at fucking 20% hp so there’s a ENORMOUS trade off.
---
Wow you got alot about me from one sentence
---
I wouldn't say a pipe dream there's numerous ways to make those caps. I get the cap restriction on vendors and the 25k cap limit yeah kinda sucks but it's not hard to handle when you realize you make caps selling to other players not vendors. The game isn't meant to be played alone and i can see how many people don't like the interaction with how fallout used to be but your playing an MMO where the real advantage is bartering with a human with no set prices.
---
I don't mean "harder" if it means more difficult which can be countered by playing better. Bonus points if it's not just remembering the game but actually learning to take advantage of various mechanics.
---
I do mind "harder" if it means increasing grinding which can *only* be countered by increasing repetition. Negative bonus points for making the desired payout random, so some if not most of my repetitive playthroughs don't even yield anything of use.
---
By all means, have long missions that take me across appalachia and challenge my character in every possible way (except for tolerance of repetition), but have something worthwhile waiting at the finish line.
---
Enjoying the SBQ fights much more now - yes her loot isn't great, but just the satisfaction of the hunt/kill without the TSE cheesers ruining it.  One fight was from a nuke I launched, small group, a friend and her team showed up, plus one other random, just 6 of us.
---
Larger groups still result in a terrible lagfest though, plus one time her body despawned into an ash pile almost instantly.  And took forever before you could loot it.  Ammo drain isn't too bad - I mix it up between the gatling and hammering.  Even ended the weekend with more ultracite 5mm than I started with.
---
Some other tips - don't use the Excavator PA and make sure you have First Aid - both will increase your survivability and keep your stimpak usage down.  Also - I'll never run with Healing Factor, cause its negative is really bad.  Chem Field and chems OTOH - good!  Since the ghouls are literal junkies, I'm always stocked with Psychobuff/Psychotats and pop them like candy during the fight.
---
Theres chainsaws in this game
---
This shouldnt be downvoted, this is the thing you should do in this situation. 
---
Out

Touch
---
If it were to go f2p it would open the audience to more people to shit fest on fallout 76 
---
So that’s another reason why it will never go f2p
---
10/10
---
Platform?
---
I think it’s about 20GB but I’m not sure, look on steams required specs and that’ll tell you, it’s the same on all platforms
---
With the way I've setup my perks, I'd much prefer a bolt-action pipe rifle over a hunting rifle. More damage, less weight. Can also have more durability with Licensed plumber but I've ended up not really needing it.
---
I restarted just for this achievement. I just couldn't go with out it.
---
I have a mole-mascot costume, that's nightmares for weeks right there. 
---
I loved the shit out of my Gauss, when it did 875 dmg. Now -- with all the bugs, the shitty damage, *and* the fact that I have to use 3 perk points to even carry the ammo -- I have switched to an AAE Handmade. My god is it nice.
---
I found one. It was pretty useless. 
---
Looked awesome, though.
---
I mean in a game where rifles kill people in 2 shots (or 1 if it's crit-sneak) melee kind of has to be a 1-shot kill or it's just useless, although you have access to extremely powerful defensives like blocker and suppressor, do you use either of these?  Or LW?
---
That being said, I can agree that 1-shot kills, especially relatively skill-less ones, are more or less just bad design and un-fun.
---
If you're on PC, it's around 50GB.
---
You might as well give up in Bethesda they don't even read this shit. Even if they did why would they care it's all about money now
---
And maybe you're so desperate you are grasping at any straw to make a terrible decision legitimate.  You may also like the.find the tweet where Todd said they don't give a shot about Fallout backstory.

Imagine if you didn’t pay $60 for a shit game by a company who uses 10 year old engines for their game in 2019. 
---
Yea (apparently).  So the original/main PS4 is in our bedroom with both of our profiles.  When I deactivated that PS4 and activated the "new PS4" downstairs, we can download and play all the games no problem with both profiles.  When my wife tries to play on her profile now in the bedroom, it says she cannot.  The message is "Cannot Use this Content.  This content can be used only by the following users who have a license for it" and it lists my profile.  
---
I'll just google it but I guess what I'm asking is that both you and your husband can play any game on any profile on either PS4 and you didn't have to buy an additional license for any, correct?
---
Worst case scenario is that she just plays downstairs (or we physically move the PS4s to where she wants to play mostly).  This isn't a major deal we are experiencing,  but annoying.
---
Nice, now he has something useless to cluster his inventory! Better drop it and use a board instead if he wants to kill enemies.
---
No, they didn't
---
They put a cap of 1500 pounds over your max carry weight. If you max carry weight is 375, you can carry 1875 pounds while over encumbered. After that, you cannot pick anything else up until you drop weight.
---
No. I like a challenge. It’s why we play games. 
---
NV wasnt one of the VS-4000 (or whatever the vault tec simulation software is called) games though, at least not to my knowledge.
---
My wife worked hard on these
---
Stashes based on inventory slots rather than weight 
---
I had similar situations Saturday. Faster fire rates and mutations not working, but I didn't have rad worms. And hadn't taken rad x. 
---
I want to say „yes it stacks because it’s logical“
---
But bethesda has a lot of hidden and capped limits - same as to running and sprinting speed 
---
And I wouldn’t be surprised if they were to use it to make sneaky balances 
---
Not perfect but 1010100193938383 times better than fallouts optimisation and garbage servers haha, keep defending this game it’s amazing. 
---
Not worth it describes loggin in the game nowadays. Guns are a joke and unless you are melee have fun spending hundreds of bullets to kill a simple super mutant.
---
When in-game player vending comes in, I can see this being less of a problem. Lower barrier of entry than what you have to do at the moment.
---
I still doesn't change what I think about giving the economy a balance once-over but this will certainly help.
---
Higher levels get shuffled into older servers.
---
They have to reset them frequently or they go to shit/crash 
---
Probably because the creation engine wasnt designed with netcode in mind but. Whatever.
---
This is true. Energy weapons are worse than you think. 
---
? I just turned level 20 and I can one shot kill level 5 . 
---
LOL, the only thing that cheeses her since launch is melee. Only time TSE actually "cheesed" it was with the explosive boublehead stacking.
---
I wish people would stop asking for wooden armor to be taken off the loot lists, it might not be right for your build, but it does have benefits. It's light weight, it can be modified to have a stealth buff at night, and it gives poison resistance.
---
Same thing happens to me with my Harpoon Guns. Both legendaries, but one is explosive and the other is anti-armor. I'm on PC.
---
I was going off the fact that events of New Vegas directly relate to events that are for sure in the simulation. I mean, all the games do really, but I was just giving Bethesda a pass because they heavily retcon stuff anyway. 
---
Thats IF we get new players
---
why are you even on this subreddit if this is your mindset? im not going to defend fallouts major issues but at the same time i am not going to praise another game for having its own fair share of problems
---
As far as Brotherhood, there's always some lawful good types looking to go on a righteous crusade. Futuristic knights-errant defending the wastes from dangerous tech and vile monsters? There's always someone dumb enough to be a hero, even if they were smart enough to be a vault dweller.
---
...I like to think I'm keeping the balance between MODUS and the Bros. I'm in and out of Whitesprings Bunker a lot, so I usually steal a technical data to feed back to Camp Venture. Also I do all the bot stop quests, then blow up the bots (awfully convenient for them to step on a land mine when they line up for patrol -- orbital strike works good too).
---
Yep, a FPS game where a board is stronger than any gun is a failed game. Its unbeliviable how they think this is balanced. Melee is absurdly boresome in FPS games as well.
---
Be in her melee range when she dies, hopefully on the ground. That is the only way I have reliably seen loot on her. If I am shooting from any range outside of that it's 50/50.
---
That's what they said about all games that later went f2p. I'm not saying it'll happen in the next few weeks. I don't think Bethesda have actively planned the transition yet. But by the end of the year I think it will be free
---
Yeah no your right that was insensitive of me I’ll remove the comment
---
This game is so fucked up thats the least of its problems.
---
Yes, so they probably first slow the game down, then release the content. That way it should last longer.
---
If I find a Reactive Plates mod, I will put it on a Torso for you and let you know. I did find a Reactive Plates mod for T-45.
---
I've yet to see them.  Or Deep Pocketed.
---
Used to seem them all the time at vendors like Welch randomly while server hopping prior to the vendor patch.  Now I'm wishing I had bought them all.  Got BOS Arm, Torso, and Deep Pocketed Torso before the patch, but nothing after.  Still need Deep Pocketed Leg and Arm, and BOS Leg, to complete by Heavy Combat armor build.
---
I'm focusing on visiting BOS areas daily now to try to find random spawns of armor.
---
Good idea, I'm going to try that. 
---
I just went through 400 stimpaks and over 1000 5.56 fighting 4 scorchbeast. It’s getting a bit ridiculous. I can’t even see them because they’re all bugged out and never stop attacking.
---
Without major changes to the dev team, I honestly don't see a positive future for this game.
---
I'm not like the naysayers who are like "this game is already dead!" but if they can't handle basic things like rolling back code versions or adequate testing before pushing fixes, it's going to be a very steep uphill climb for this game to even get to acceptability, let alone a good place.
---
well apparently I alone with this. I guess this has something to do with my computer....
---
Serums are really cheap from other players, from 250 - 500 caps, and many offer every serum. There's lots of &lt;500 cap vendors on PC, and &lt;300 cap vendors for consoles. Several vendors discount further if you provide the materials, particularly the flux. 
---
unfortunately, most online games have to employ a grinding simulator feel to them, so that people have to keep playing. I've actually encountered much much worse grinding, where some games put RNG inside of RNG, inside of RNG. Some games even take almost a full year of grinding to get enough of certain "items" to trade in for something better. Sometimes after that year, they come out with better stuff, that negates that item you just wasted a year on. 
---
The way that these companies look at it, is if you get everything high-end in the first week or month, what's left to play towards? I think in the future, they will get more strict, and balance a bunch of other stuff. Who knows what content will be added.. silos are for the first "RAID" boss, and hopefully there will be added mechanics for new threats in the future. There is a lot of potential sitting in the game, but they just have to go about it the right way. 
---
It will be better, but there will be grind, and unbalanced PvP, because this is how these "types" of games work. Grind is a part of a gameplay and balance problems have been a problem of loot based games forever. 
---
Beth will want to redeem the game and it will. There is one game that is more like FO76 than NMS is, and we should look how it turned out to be? It turned out to be one of the most succesfull MMORPG of this generation: ESO.
---
Can confirm that the exact same thing happens to me on PC. If i logout while inside Excavator PA, logging back in grants me +200 carry weight. If I exit the PA at any point, and get back in, I get +100 instead of +200. I do not have Calibrated Shocks so I know it should be +100 and not +200. Very reproducible for me.
---
As someone that has strongly defended the game since before it even launched I see two possible outcomes...
---
Option 1: they keep rolling out weekly updates that "fix" the previous weeks mistake until they get burnt out and realize they've dumped too much money into something they can't grasp and release the game to private servers and modders.
---
Option 2: they invest HEAVILY into some new developers (and hopefully some better QA practices...) to get this thing under control. They then start to grow the game, weekly updates bring new content, new skins, new weapons, new events, etc.
---
Personally I'm hoping for option 2. I remember I had preordered and purchased ESO (back when it had a monthly subscription to play) and it crashed hard (though not as long as 76) and then it hit a point of success and it's now a fairly big name game. I'm hoping we can see the same with 76, but I just don't know. 
---
And what will be was.
---
Yea most atom shop items have a hidden killjoy in it
---
- Those frills on the sniper suit
---
- nuka girl oversized helmet and leather cap 
---
- all closes and zipped up leather jackets 
---
Running into this now.  Started a new dweller to get a melee build going.
---
Man, what a struggle its been compared to my first play through.  
---
I gave up at lvl30.  Its just a dam hassle.  Ill just play on my main till div2 comes out.  
---
At lvl 25 With a point in Gunslinger and one in expert Gunslinger, My 308. bolt action pipe pistol (lvl20) does 67 base damage and my .45 pipe revolver (lvl20) does 50 base damage, a sneak attack with the 308 will kill a super mutant with one shot, and two shots for the revolver. 
---
However for my Sniper rifles build, one point each in Rifleman and expert rifleman, 1 point in covert operative, 3 points in sneak I found I had to focus on a fully levelled (Lvl25) .308 (hardened receiver) rifle as my primary long range one shot rifle. A lvl25 combat rifle (hardened receiver) for medium to short range once i'm discovered (3 to 5 shots to the chest, to down a super mutant) 
---
I got a handmade at Lvl25, but could rarely use it as .556 ammo was scarce until Ammosmith at level 34
---
I tend to grind areas on weekdays,a good place is the shanty town in the middle of the dried lake with wade airport workshop and the Lake workshop. You can claim both workshops, clear out the shanty town and sommerville down the road, defend both workshops (sometimes twice). It usually takes me 2.5 hours and I get loads of gunpowder and 308 ammo. 
---
Then I do more adventuring on weekends. 
---
What are your current perks? 
---
this is my build, minus a few perks (currently Lv47, but includes all the rifle perks I have and you only have to be Lvl 32
---

---
you should only have trouble with Lvl 28+ enemies, and only if there are a number of them. one on one at Lvl 30 using this build I've taken out lvl 48 deathclaws as long as they can't get to me. (lots of sneaking) sniping from high places. 
---
Though lvl 28 mirelurk Kings still annihilate me.        
---
I'm pretty sure that grape mentats raises charisma and adds an effect equivalent to hard bargain 3 that doesn't stack. So, with low charisma, the perk and the drug together still works better than just the perk, but then the combination shouldn't be better than the drug alone. 
---
At high charisma, if the effective stat level is capped, then you'd expect what you saw: the additional charisma has no effect, and the bargaining doesn't stack.
---
Must be a DUPER! I heard  dupers were the ones responsible for the prisioner camps in World War 2.
---
So a youtuber killing his friends righto?
---
Picsssssss
---
I have a question, did players ever find all bodies from the main characters in game? Does anyone know where is Abbie's body?
---
What do you mean? I can list the stats if you want.
---
At that level it is pretty strong. Wait til you get much higher level and start to get some mods on those weapons. 
---
As far as I've seen, the spear is unmoddable so it's as powerful as it's going to get.
---
Imagine if some people did always need to yuck someone else’s yum? You didn’t have to come and talk crap about what someone else likes?
---
And then when called out on being a parade pooper try and defend it with some bullshit opinions that they try and pass off as facts?
---
You know. Just allow people to like thing?
---
Yeah i was 202 with max for 225
---
Yea, if you can VATS through smoke, not much of a point having it. And even if you couldn't, how many times you actually see smoke being MVP in casual games? Most of the times you throw it just for "cool" and there actually has no gain from it.
---
It is interesting to see how games become something else when you put them on competitive mode. Like in CS:GO, you come from mid to B, smoke CT, now player on A can't see you. You now take out the guy on B door. By the time the guy from A gets to B, you are ready for him. In casual game you would never care about smoking that place and taking advantage of smoking it.
---
My whole base hovers in the air. If it would be a 'normal' base, I also would not be able to place it again. Thats why I always use 1 ground element, its a workaround, which lets you place the base almost everywhere, but it looks crapy.
---
I spent a day hopping Grafton Greg and nada. He was my go to guy for that stuff but all I got that day was super mutant blood all over my axe. I'm now doing the exact thing you are. Creeping around BOS sites hoping to get lucky.
---
Some people say so.  But it's still working just fine for me.  So not sure?  I see Caution a lot, but still get 2.00x damage for my hits while sneaking.  And those Scorched and Ghouls around the Mire and Cranberry bog can't find me.
---
Still see so much utter ignorance around here - TSE's didn't need bobblehead stacking...  explosives damage cuts through her ballistic/energy DR, while melee with Incisor manages to reduce her ballistic DR by 75%.  She has an innate DR that reduces all final damage including explosives.
---
Explosive effect in the pre nerf (without bobbleheads) &gt;&gt;&gt; melee.
---
Of course, you'd expect TSE crutchers to be clueless.
---
I only started this game last week and my initial thought was it's way too easy. After the patches, still a bit on the easy side. I should not be able to take down a lvl 63 enemy at character lvl 20 with lvl 10 weapons but that's how it is.
---
Admittedly I spent over 400 hrs on FO4 survival mode and know all the tricks of the trade. Sounds like you're not managing your inventory and tagging important components like adhesive and screws for armor/weapon repairs and upgrades. Just a thought
---
That doesn't matter for your argument though. You stated that the Creation engine couldn't support a high number of npcs due to being limited in memory allocation (x86) because of age.
---
Not only does that not make any sense, there are games (x86) built on the same foundation as bethesda's creation engine (W40K using gamebryo in 2008, DAoC using NetImmerse in 2001) that did just that.
---
And I also don't understand why the entity class inside the framework is of any relevance. What do you think an entity is? It's just an empty hull and you select voice, dialogue, maybe a route to path along and all the smaller details like factions, hostility etc.
---
If there is a specific 'npc' class they didn't use, it's probably just because the features of that specific class weren't necessary and just bloat for npcs in fallout 76. That does not invalidate at all them being NPCs.
---
It just means they're less complex npcs.
---
Agreed though, the enclave is the only faction with interactions while most other factions feel like reading long forgotten newspapers and pretending to be involved 
---
PS, I may have an extra leg plan laying around for trade
---
I haven't gotten any Combat Armor mods yet, but I did find Marine Torso, Legs, and Wetsuit plans.  (Shared the wetsuit with my teammates though, figured I should grab _everything_ without them getting some loot).
---
Got a plan for the Power Fist yesterday too.  Gonna have to try that one out, one of my teammates had a lower level one that was doing well, I imagine at higher levels it will be fun.
---
Agreed, there is potential for the rebirth Brotherhood chapter if there are righteous wannabe knights around and maaaaybe there are plans for a DLC to reestablish the connection to Maxson (although that would be a borderline deus-ex-machina) in order to push out more BoS content.
---
I love how MODUS doesn't bat an eye when you help them construct the robots only to blow them up with their own satellite :D
---
I missed part one so I had to go back and read it, don’t stop writing! This was great!
---
Do you have Radicool perk?
---
exactly this.
---
Yup. I’ve become very skeptical. People that claim to have been disconnected 43 times in one session. When you average it out, it seems weird to think someone would sit there for hours and hours trying to play a game they keep getting dumped from every 3-7 minutes.
---
It’s amazing how after a patch there’s all these weird claims. 
---
Like how all the people who accidentally bought something from the Atomic Shop, and demand a refund.
---
They should streamline some ammo - I mean I never use syringer ammo or cryolator, and I don’t see the need of separating plasma to fusion cells
---
At this point i firmly believe they are focused on fixing stuff, and there s a LOT of stuff that needs fixing.
---
I’m sure though respec will come soon enough. I understand many that are upset because they got their build screwed over by that last nerf but there are more pressing matters right now.
---
Just relog, should fix it.  It's one of the game bugs,  quests don't always show up. 
---
Definitely agree. 
---
Now that you mention it I'm not sure I've found anything but Marine plans myself. Do you think they took all combat plans off the spawn table?
---
And the power fist is AWESOME. I'm a bloodied melee guy so it's one of my go to weapons for shutting the mouth of a smart ass mole miner. 
---
Why don't they just to a talent Master like world of Warcraft, just pay pay some junkie guy for a high end chem that will Respec you???
---
Damn, I don't think I've unlocked any troubleshooter perks or gear, but I do remember I found plans a while back for a Tesla Rifle that I haven't built yet. May have to give that a trial run.
---
That was the bad part of it to me. It doesn't make much sense about her clutching her mother. She dispised her and very likely she died fast after getting hit by the raider. I think they intended doing something else and end up leaving her like that with her mother, even if it didnt make sense when we hear the tape.
---
Are the enemies really *that* spongey? I know everybody is freaking out that their tse went from 1500 to 2 or 300, but my unarmed guy doesn't really have much trouble killing most things *with a pistol, with no pistol perks equipped.*
---
I would honestly stop playing the game until Bethesda gets there shit together
---
A quick feedback idea.
---
Consider a cataclysm event like WOW did and add more content and MPCs.  I love the Fallout Universe and FO76 has some great bright spots.  But I can't convince my friends who all played FO4 to join me because all the known issues and bad press. I feel that it just needs a big reset.
---
Thanks for all your hard work behind the scenes.  Fans like me are routing for you guys! 
---
True, none of my perks are optimized for any particular type of ranged weapon, although I do have some buffs for them and am using armor piercing. But I do have a pretty decent melee build and even then with All Rise it was taking forever to kill most of them past the first laser grid. 
---
I just wanna see this spear. I have a ski sword, guitar sword, pitchfork. I love the random melee weapons. Haven't found a spear yet though
---
It's not being made **HARDER**, it's being made more **TEDIOUS**. Had they made the game actually harder, I'd be up for it. But I can't stand the drudgery, the tedium, the busy-work. Nothing in this game is actually HARD. It's just tedious and time consuming.
---
When I play the recent Assassin's Creeds, going from Normal difficulty all the way to Nightmare is a game changer. The gameplay is the same, but it's harder because you have to work for your kills, and mistakes get you killed, mercilessly. In this game, all the changes so far make me grind more, farm more, craft more ammo, carry more stuff, but none of this is actually challenging. 
---
Worst of all, even if you hop through all the loops, you don't get a payoff! When I play ESO, and I kill the final boss in a veteran dungeon, I KNOW I will get that boss' helmet as a drop, which lets me have one of the boss' iconic abilities. Which is awesome. But when I kill the 3-star legendary in FO76, and I get a clipboard (if I'm lucky!) that pisses me off. And devs, instead of fixing THIS, are nerfing the fun, and making the game more tedious.
---
Don't get me wrong, Explosive guns, especially TSEs, did need nerfs. But they fucked up even that. Because instead of nerfing just TSE and Explosives, they also nerfed non-legendary explosive weapons (missile launcher, M79, etc.), which were trash to begin with, and are now utterly useless. So they couldn't even do that right. 
---
What is your hunting rifle damage?
---
As a last ditch, you can sometimes drop a bag as close to where you lost yours as you can, and it may transfer all of the inventory to the new one. 
---
Useful when your bag drops inside a wall.
---
And it was the SimTek 5000. 
---
I still have my copy of the original Fallout 1 manual. Had to pull it out and take a look. 
---
Sure! Where's the games screenshot folder? The spear was on a random Scorched in the ash area by the way.
---
I can see that.
---
I have read them (because I can craft one), but I have no idea where I picked them up.
---
LOL, the inconsistency seems to be one of the few consistencies of the game, IMO, but good to know. Will have to try another run with a different loadout and see what luck of the draw I get.
---
NOT ALL HEROES WEAR CAPES.
---
Seriously.  The Kanawha County DMV is the worst DMV ever in the history of ever and I hate it as much as you.
---
Even when I go to lunch in the plaza, I drive by it just to give it the middle finger.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** WhoptimusPrime! ^(hug)
---
&gt; it might not be right for your build, 
---
It isn't right for 90 percent of builds, which is why most people complain about it. 
---
Being optimistic here:
---
I'm not expecting a significant announcement of content until around E3.  We will get updates like normal until then but big meaty content won't come for a while.  Just an opinion not fact.
---
So, about Abbie, did anyone find her body?
---
Really? That's good to hear! I'll hit up one of the subreddits then in a few hours. Thanks!
---
yeah, that one assaultron was an absolute pain. Don't know how you got through with only using a few stimpacks, I seemed to burn through like 15 of them in an hour (mostly from the goddamn gutsys). PA? no PA?
---
The only valid question about wood armor: 
---
Why does it even exist?
---
He literally said it would take months, he's not bitching about a single day. Holy shit. 
---
Unfortunately, it seems they may be substituting nerfs for new content. They have had so many bug fixes to do and have so much *more* that still needs fixing that they are undoubtedly behind their schedule for producing DLC. Now, I could be wrong, but a lot of what they are doing now seems like they are trying to stretch out the content that they have by introducing artificial difficulty in the form of grinding and constant resource management in an effort to keep players occupied until they actually have something new to put on the plate.
---
They fixed it for like 4 days 
---
This. I don't think Bethesda planned on the other factions turning out like this and the Enclave being on top due to circumstances long before the VDs arrival. There's hoping that they'll introduce DLC to breathe some life in the dead factions, since they did a lot to advertise them. Otherwise their impact on the player base would be fleeting. 
---
It would work if Maxson found another way to reach out to the Appalachian chapter of the BoS again (so BGS won't have to introduce human NPCs to push BoS content). 
---
Provided it's implemented properly and PvP has been fixed, it would be a fun idea if there was an active "war" between the factions, which will be carried out by players. Something along the lines of claiming landmarks for your faction and holding it against the others in order to get resources/equipment/buffs, etc. This is just a rough idea, don't call me out on it.
---
But like i said, it would require an incentive for the vaultdwellers ingame to continue what the factions started.
---
Mods are like using cheat codes,  imo.  If you can't play within the way the game is laid out,  then you aren't really playing the same game.  
---
Error 404: girl not found. XD
---
Now that you mention it, the Hub is directly referenced in NV. That would certainly tie them in my mind.
---
I agree with you. The adjustments to Sneak have made enemies "awareness" insane. You can be in caution or danger with no enemies in the immediate area. 
---

You find these in the trading subreddits right? What will be a good price for each serum? Need a good buying price when I post for looking to buy. Thanks by the way!
---
Yeah never heard that one before.. Imagine loading into a new server to get your base back. 
---
Rotating the CAMP sometimes seems to have an effect on which direction you are facing when you fast travel, but it's hard for me to be certain. Whenever I pick up the unit to rotate it, it's hard to put it back in the exactly same spot.
---
I would recommend just playing with it until you get close enough, as only a fast travel mat will really give you full control of position and direction 
---
Remember when the community said give us a repsec point per level and they are like, "yeah np".  Then they nerfed XP three different times.
---
I would pay atoms for special respecs 100% right now.  Even if you want to do a minor change, say 9 points from one special into another, you have to assume that is an 18 level change.  9 levels to move the special points, and another 9 for perks you might not have.  That's kind of a lot at this point in the game.  You would definitely be dedicating several days unless you play like a crackhead.
---
The worst part is you will be doing all that leveling not even playing the spec you want to be.  Not to mention you might not even like the change you made and that can be a huge mountain of regret.  Also, each level you put toward moving a special point is kind of throwaway.  It doesn't make your character better, just different.
---
50+ gb on xb1
---
There already is the monetization stream from the cash shop (once they get it right) and the game is down to 8 bucks if you look at the right places.
---
Would they actually lose anything?
---
I am usually against going F2P but it would be perfect for this mess IMHO.
---
You can't. The workshops aren't meant for decorating and base building anymore. They're simply for placing down extractors and collecting the materials.
---
Vault Dwellers can still join the Responders - it's a voluntary force of citizens that generate their own oversight and chain of command based on available Human resources and have been operating that way since well before the Vault opened; the incentive to serve comes from your own personal motivation to make a positive contribution to the lives and experiences of the others we find playing around us. The Enclave is the only faction with someone still telling you what to do aside from Rose: they do give you purpose, some spiffy nazi-ish uniforms, an illusion of control, and someone manipulative to follow in the face of MODUS; and I can see how their structured system of surveillance and their private club could win a lot of us over
---
Oh Mann that's dumb 
---
There is also a Flaming Bow Blade Mod for the Chainsaw, even with that, it's pretty useless, but... Might be just the ticket for scaring the pee pee out of new vault dwellers, while wearing the Ritual Bindings Outfit.
---
Actually, I play solo since the beginning, and I always found the game far too easy, so I am really not against a bit more difficulty... of course I guess perks and speciality may affect the game experience since, obviously nothing has been properly balanced properly.    
---
Once you have some 10k+ caps, you don't even have to grind anything, you can buy lead, steel, fibers and do whatever you want.  
---
For me, at this point, the game mainly  lacks some interesting encounters with proper strategy

My last 7 SBQ kills, 4 have had spinning circles until the body disappeared (no loot) and three have had ultracite vents, and arm patterns - and that's it (No prime plans).
---
So basically zero loot the last 7 kills.
---
I mostly do, at least until I level up enough to put them down with ease
---
Question, where does it say the woman in the suply closet is her? To me it just says responder corpse and the tape doesnt say anything that shows its the same woman. Did I miss out something?
---
52.37gb on PSN after updates etc.

Imagine reading the OP’s comments to see that loading in again didn’t render his bass and all his items were gone and his stash. You have eyes, use them. The games shit, you’re obviously a Bethesda robot built to live by this game to the death even though it’s a solid $5 game not even that. 
---
We will, play the game longer and buy more from the Atom Store with real money, it's so obvious I don't know why they didn't think of it sooner...
---
Just off to the store to buy some fancy bling, be right back O\_o
---
Thanks, I actually started (or rather: attempted) writing a novel two years ago that I still haven't finished today.
---
Tl;dr
---
Man (Nick) gets in an accident on his motorcycle while fiancée is giving birth, fiancée dies in labor, man wakes up after 16 years of coma, escapes the hospital with a nurse, they start to get fond of one another, the man's estranged mother left mysterious notes before her death that described events in the future, they find out where Nick's (now 16 yo) daughter lives and the man who's taken care of his daughter looks like an old, blind version of himself. The man works in the local university and invites Nick and Nurse to test an invention of his. A dream machine that lets you access your memories kind of like Assassin's Creed's animus. Nick relives memories but notices that his dream actions change reality. Turns out old blind man is old blind Nick. Dream machine works kinda like time machine. Nick now stuck between raising his daughter and staying with nurse or going back and preventing his accident and even help his fiancée survive. Decides against the latter, old blind Nick is mad and turns into Main Antagonist. Queue BioShock Infinite-esque Ending (to prevent Nick from becoming old blind evil Nick he's gotta travel back and prevent, well, something).

I got lost somewhere between all the Sci-Fi and Romance and have a Writer's Block lasting half a year now. 
---
Naw bud flamer mode dual blade and repair to 200 percent with perks and it deals some damage
---
Oh SHIT! That was Claire Hudson!? I thought that was just some random Responder. That girl did not get along well with closets...
---
I'm not tired of it, personally once I do overcome whatever challenge is in my way I feel like a total boss.
---
Not sure if you're trolling or not, but wasn't it confirmed that there are only 3 end-game dungeons to grind?.. Its just Destiny all over again. Buy a $60 game only to spent anothre $60 on bullshit dlc's.
---
Looks like a trader in 7 days to die, I might confuse games, drop some fuel and ask for a quest. ;)
---
Keep fighting the good fight
---
because it's the best sneak armor in the game?
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** 7hmcdougle! ^(hug)
---
I think they are going to find out we were only still playing the game despite all the garbage because we found ways to get around all the dull boring grindy shit.  People are quitting because they are slowly nerfing all those things.
---
It was the 3rd nuke I launched across dozens now. I just had to have my revenge. Not really satisfied by the bots not mutating into an instatiated singularity of paper pushing madness that would try to use players as stamps tho.
---
That thing must be the rarest item in the game. See mods for it all the time, have yet to find one. Until this pic I didn't think they existed.
---
&gt; without major changes [...] I don’t see a positive future 
---
&gt; I am not like [...] „this game is already dead“
---
What is your vision when there is no major change?
---
No, not really. It's still ridiculously easy even without power armor. You can reach endgame content without legendary gear, the game bombards you with stims/ammo/junk, and on top of that the AI is stupid enough to cheese it anyway. 
---
You couldn't remove the stuff before either. 
---
Damn, could have checked if i was at home. Also something I was wondering.
---
Wow! This is just amazing work! **Thank you!**
---
Me and my friends are having way to much fun playing the game. It’s not just because we are fun. The game is providing great moments for us. And we’re also adults that understand how things are never perfect. 
---
We encounter bugs. But no where near the level others are claiming. I think people over exaggerate which is stupid.
---
It’s not going f2p. That’s a lie that’s been pushed by people who aren’t even playing the game.
---
Can you even put a CAMP that close to 76?
---
I feel you. I hit this wall on my toon a while back, and ended up just going back to the super low level zones and farming the shit out of everything I needed to get back on my feet. Took a few days of 'just running around'. But, I found the biggest tea pot! That was cool...
---
This could easily be abused. 
---
Could be worse.  I picked up a Quad Assaultron head.
---
For those who don't know, the ammo capacity of an assaultron head is unlimited.  But this one holds four times as much as unlimited.
---
Similarly useful is the the VATS boosted switchblade...
---
Yeah I would like to put some treasured items in a separate stash box. Even if it did share the same weight limit, that would be hopefully increased soon. It's annoying sorting through stuff sometimes. Having to scroll through long lists of things to get to this or that item.
---
It’s great how bethesda promotes weapon diversity, isn’t it? :)
---
If you have the answer if you are home. Please let me know. Thanks
---
It's in a shack a little bit northwest of the pumpkin house. There are lots of scorched and usually a scorchbeast. You've been warned lol.
---
I can check in about 9 hrs (once home from work) if someone hasn't helped you out already :)
---
I agree, I have certain weapons, gear and some cool stuff that can easily be the 1/4 weight of my stash and it's kind frustrating the weight limit
---
Ok thanks!
---
Actually enjoying the game more - not crazy about some bugs, but its so much more peaceful now.  Notice far less griefing overall, and no more TSE shitters just wiping enemies before anyone else can even get a shot on them.
---
Did the fireflies event at the lighthouse yesterday wearing a beer hat, got 3 of the daily challenges done since I went to the nearby shack for some quick wild animal kills.  Took a picture with the mothman that shows up to bless you at the end of that event too.  Starting to work on another character/build, decided to rebuild that character's CAMP, did that last night with the Superbowl on in the background.
---
Had a run through Whitesprings nuke for flux stabilizers, then Watoga for raw violet, a handful of SBQ fights, 1 nuke launch, some events like AWOL Armaments and Census Violence on my main.  Also went to a Top Of The World nuke, first time exploring that area nuked.
---
If you enjoy the old ones, give Atom RPG a go.
---
and we both know a month is exaggerated.... just like my 1 day was.... holy shit
---
8 bucks is already pseudo F2P if you ask me.
---
Nope ever since the last update they screwed the game up then tried to “hot fix “ but really it was another screw job so move on to another game or keep the grind going it’s up to you 
---
That cam is huge! Did you have any budget left to build turrets?
---
LOL.  I see what you did there.
---
I got the calibrated shocks Mod from Chad. It took a few days of server hopping, but they do proc. At least for the excavator. What was crazy is I got both of them within a 2 hour window on the last day of looking. The one I can't seem to get to proc is the X-01's. I've seen 4 Jetpacks but 0 Calibrated Shocks for the X-01. X-01 is basically un-usable for me without them so it sucks. 
---
In Germany they are already giving out free copies with the purchase of a part controllers
---
Could you PM me where CD copies are 8?
---
I imagine that if bethesda announces something of the fallout 76 in the e3, the reaction of the public will be as artifact of valve 
---
\&gt;&gt; Am I just playing the entire game wrong
---
yes and no. the problem is you are propably playing what you like or what your style is.
---
unfortunately this is not always the best way to play this game. You could save a lot of pain
---
if you switch over to melee until level 50. then you would not need to worry about ammo. 
---
are you playing on xbox?
---
Who said the residents left? \^
---
Is it so fast it lets you harvest tons of water per hour or so slow you have to stay by it for hours on end to get 5 water?
---
Please make a video with "Welcome to the Jungle" playing as you scare the new arrivals. 
---
I found it again.  It's on the road due west of Whitespring train station.
---
The funny thing is if you got cavalier armor and spammed block, you would never die.
---
I’m 47 and the grind is real it’s a struggle out there still 
---
Anything to just keep crapping on something. 
---
Maybe you should consider why you need to be like this? 
---
This happens to me as well (some of the time), I usually just unplug the second monitor.
---
Harper's can definitely suck if you agro in the wrong spot.
---
If you cover an in game paint with say vault Tec or Camo, they will all look the same regardless of what you have painted under it. The only thing that changes is the stats. 
---
Yes, very strange. It was a pretty lonely server. We only counted 12 people on the server over 2 hours of playtime. Not sure if it was due to superbowl or if the game truly is starting to die. I am not crazy high level (137) and I have noticed fewer and fewer higher level (&gt;100) players online.
---
I'll need to check what it's called, but at level 40, I found a 32 magazine pump-action shotgun with explosive bullets, and it only needed regular shotgun shells.
---
I maxed out the shotgunner perks, and huge ***note:*** Since it's technically an explosive, the explosive perks apply to it (larger blast radius, damage, etc.) There's another perk that increases damage output for 30 secs if you kill an enemy, and so my damage output could be &gt;750 HP for one shot.
---
It's weird where it had no middle distance use. I could take down a scorch beast only fairly close or really far in about three or four shots. With a nuke on Whitespring, it was a +400 XP grind for each glowing one.
---
yepp i agree player vending will do a ton of good, your average player doesn't come to reddit or facebook to buy things which is a big disadvantage.  
---
Cheesier than fondue.
---
Whats the use of bulk? There arent enough caps at vendors to sell them anyway
---
Right now if you aren’t playing melee, you are brutally punished by every other single spec being absolute garbage. TSE was how guns were competitive and without it you are forced to go melee. Haven’t logged since the nerf and won’t until there is new content. 
---
Have a look over at r/fallout76settlements you'll get a lot of inspiration over there!
---
Fantastic informative post and I’m glad it’s been passed onto the dev’s
---
I think their entire skill tree needs be redone completely. 
---
Obviously the special is pretty set, but Crafters are dead. Anybody can craft anything all they need is 5 or 6 Intelligence and pick some points into whatever crafting they want. There's no uniqueness between builds except for combat (which has heavy melee meta anyway). 
---
But I have 2 toons. 
---
1) melee meta - 15str and 15int and like 6/7 Agi and 6/7lck. I just use the level 50 All Rise awarded for finishing the Watoga Mayor quest chain. With adrenaline, my All Rise gets a 1086 dmg per swing. Lol! That's not even power attack. I can literally two hit a 50 scorchbeast, 2.1 hit a 65, 2.5hit a 80. Most everything else dies in a single hit, even 68 super mutants. Of course I have to build up the added damage, but that just means I have to power attack for one hit kills. 
---
2) stealth sniper - 15agi, 15per, 13lck crit and damage and Unyielding set. My primary weapon was a lever gun until I found a zealot lever gun and threw a scorched killer on it. Bought a TSE Lever Gun a while back and that became my primary. Now that it's nerfed, my primary weapon is an instigating handmade. Great range and accuracy. I use gunfu and vats and I'm dropping everything in single hits (if they at full health) from a pretty good distance. I still saved the zealot scorched killer lever gun and with my Unyielding, my agility keeps me pretty disguised during scorchbeast fights. Although it takes 3-4 sneak attacks to drop a 50 scorchbeast in flight, if I'm detected I just run and use my escape artist to keep in sneak. 
---
I know a lot of people don't want to play stealth or melee, so on my melee toon I added heavy weapons (since it's a str build anyway) and it's pretty fun. I got a  zealot Gatling gun I threw a prime receiver on for scorchbeasts. But I was using lots of explosives too, but the Nerf made carrying grenades kind of bad. So I mostly meta melee now. 
---
Yup. Much longer, and lots of "disconnected from server"
---
Ok thanks! So it would be the same on that metal armor paint with those vibrant colors?
---
Yep
---
This kind of story is right up my alley &amp; I would buy and read this in a heartbeat. I hope you find inspiration to continue your story!
---
I love open world games like FO, but I’m terrible at role playing and I don’t have an ounce of creative storytelling in my bones. I appreciate the folks that do and write their stories down on reddit &amp; AO3 and such. These stories (large and small) flesh out the game lines for me and allow me to inject the little imagination I have while playing. They change my experience and I appreciate stories like yours immensely. It changes the Leather Left Leg note from a humorous quip I will forget in five minutes to a real story I want to pursue. Thank you for that.
---
That being said, I also grab every novel I can find that is apocalyptic/steampunk/sci-fi (like my favorite games, two of which you mentioned) and devour them. I guess I have a type. :)
---
Thanks again for sharing your talent, I hope I get to read more from you!
---
Imagine if The Lord Of The Rings weren't about two hobbits travelling against all odds to the dangerous land of Mordor to destroy the ring - but rather would tell random stories of random people who not only have nothing to do with each other but also who don't share any connection with our main heroes. This would establish "lore" but it probably wouldn't be very interesting to read. That's not how classic storytelling works. And that's why the story of FO76 doesn't work.
---
What has the Freakshow to do with us leaving Vault76 to make America great again? Or with the Mistress of Mystery? Or with any other unmarked note of unmarked people in unmarked locations throughout Appalachia? Zilch!
---
Sure, FO76 has a TON of very well written, interesting and touching micro-stories to discover. And this might very well be where the game shines the most. But the problem is that our character is supposed to be the protagonist. The story is supposed to be told from our point of view and with our actions in mind.
---
And please don't tell me that the game deliberately tells its story in such a way as if we didn't really matter. In this regard, the story fails even greater - because it's US who defeat the Scorched Queen and thus prevent a possible new mass extinction event.
---
I didn't want to imply that. Maybe I should rephrase it: "The previous residents of the bunker certainly didn't leave and live."
---
Stopped playing after new patch. Bethesda fucked up and I cant support them anymore, its just not fair what they have done. No communication what so ever, just reddit Sub Dev suggestions .....
---
Yup! 
---
Exactly this at the moment. This and being constantly chased by a scorched beast. Infuriating. 
---
Is this your idea of having fun?  308 tries/week? 
---
Lord this game is so evil.
---
Lol post removed. As it should be. Don’t bring that weak shit in here again.
---
There is one in the hardware store in Clarksburg in the Toxic Valley.  It's in a loft above the cash register. I've gotten it there twice so pretty sure it's a guaranteed spawn. 
---
The beginnings of New California start in Fallout 1 and are pretty fully cemented by 2 (NCR being and actual city at that point) so that fully tied it all together. 
---
Hell, the fact that the Brotherhood of Steel are in all games just indicates that if one game is a simulation then they all must be. 
---
It does make sense I guess. At least with 1 (training simulation), 4 (the cryopods are really memory lounges), and 3 and 76 (could be in pods the whole time I guess). The Brotherhood, Enclave, and NCR could just be characters made by Vault Tek to make the simulation more realistic. 
---
Doesn't really explain the characters of 2 (great grandchild of Fallout 1 character), New Vegas (semi-random currier), or Tactics (wastelander recruited by the BoS) though. 
---
Oh well, it was a half assed theory anyway. 
---
As a person who had it since launch, no. The developers are currently too oblivious to how the players want the game, and the combat is bullet spongy as hell. I’m actually using more melee than Skyrim, and the repair system is nothing but a chore in its current state. Last patch made all of this clear and drove away the committed fan base. I’d get Battlefield V. It may be historically inaccurate, but at least things die.
---
I wonder if through a future "Get Elected President" questline the player could become President and take control of the Kovac-Muldoon Satellite in order to re-establish communications with Maxson? Eckhart is shown to have taken control of it in one of the terminal entries.
---
They said the same about No Man’s Sky and that is doing pretty well. It isn’t my cup of tea but it has grown leaps and bounds. 
---
You spelled Morrowind wrong. 
---
No people at all and no one will care if you pull the servers...
---
Realistically, all they would have to do is introduce an offline mode and/or private servers.
---
Schrödinger‘S Loot. 
---
Come on. Just change to heavy or energy. Gauss is the only bug in this game...
---
Agree 100% but would also be OK with them allowing us to bust open the cards into single or even double perks.  Leveling up and shifting perks just seems like a complete waste. 
---
How awful is the dragon when you have to rely on it on a rifle build?
---
I found a black powder pistol with +15% reload speed, 50% armor pen and 25% fire rate (ok, pointless, sadly) and was considering building around it.
---
Wow, did you even have a TSE to test?
---
Yeah I see them implementing faction wars in two years or sometime later
---
I just don’t see people still playing by the time then because Bethesda’s Design decision surrounding pvp are pretty shit so far 
---

---
We call it the horse riding simulator. I refuse to play online, I've played Rust before so NTY.

---
This is my current Rifleman Build.
---
I would recommend to focus in one style rather than spread things out.
---
I also experienced that using power armor is mandatory for nuked zones and SBQ Event. So I build around that too.
---
Unless u have 5 pieces of legendary armor with each 3 great effects, PA outshines regular armor, that's why I'm running completely without any currently.
---
Take a deep breath... Count to 10... 
---
People do realize this is a harsh wasteland... there is a PVP Achievement called Good Grief for killing players. They are just trying to reach that platinum for the game a lot of player means a lot of players who need kills.
---
I go back and forth on this. I think NPCs would give the story more weight. But, I gotta say I’ve been really digging the eerie apocalyptic everyone is dead feel too! The solemn exploration in this game is extremely addicting to me. 
---
You don't have to be directly involved in something for it to be a story. If I read a book, is that not a story? If I read notes and terminals and listen to holotapes, how is that different?
---
Me too on PC.  I bulked up a lot of stuff (started with 132 plastic), then I carefully went to my stash box (not a workbench) and did a transfer all junk.  Poof! no bulked items, no plastic.  I checked the floor, I tried hopping servers, I tried shutting down the game.  Nothing. 100lbs of bulk is gone.
---
That would be awesome but I am on PS4. I appreciate the offer at least!
---
I don't really find this example equivocal.
---
Yeah i had the chameleon issue last night also. I stayed invisible all the time except for my gun. Didn't seem to affect enemy detection though. They still saw me just fine.... 
---
Don’t forget them jacking up the costs on items to purchase.  Grind away! 
---
&gt; Do you think they took all combat plans off the spawn table?
---
Would suck if they did.  I'd hope at least BOS mods would still be there.  I just check the the security storage and bunk room every time I go drop off Technical Data (which I try to get once a day).  If I don't find Tech Data I just visit it on my way to Harper's Ferry for my vendor.
---
Other than some weapon plans and mods, Marine Armor plans and a couple mods are all I've found there in the past few days.  I'm just thinking BOS and Pocketed/Deep Pocketed are really rare since they are the best mods for the equipment.  One day I'll be decked out in Deep Pocketed BOS Heavy Combat Armor... until then I'm gonna keep my Heavy Leather cause I cannot give up that +40 carry weight (Already have DP BOS COmbat Chest, so that's one down).
---
I think it may seem that way to me because of the TSE nerf. Although, I usually can get through Harper's Ferry with a silenced TSE handmade and chameleon and not set off any alarm bells with enemies until I get to the church.
---
An alternative would be to flag things to protect them from scrapping.
---
It's fine, I completed it too early but the issue of having the soldier's ticket before getting the DMV quest seems to not be a problem anymore as I was able to progress ok.
---
The real mvp
---
I'd reflect on why you're getting so triggered over me simply pointing out facts.
---
Or why you immediately associate a low price/F2P with "crapping on something". There are amazing F2P and/or cheap games out there.
---
Thanks for your kind words. I guess I gotta sit down and continue writing on my novel some day. If it's ever released, reddit will be the first site to know, having limited access to marketing myself and all.
---
I love roleplaying in FO76 (or generally online games that let you do that). I started out as a horror clown with a Faschnacht Mask, I was a Lever-Action weilding cowboy and right now I am THE SILVER SHROUD. It's incredible that they released the suit in the Atom Store but not the Silver SMG skin. Bwaaaahh.
---
Note: concerning my novel
---
Movie rights not reserved but please, Nick = Bradley Cooper or Gerard Butler, fianceé = Jlaw, Nurse = Ellen Page 
---
When I was at that level I would tailor my weapons to the area I was going into. For example, Super Mutants drop a crap load of .308 ammo.  So if I was going into New Gad or Wade Airport where there are almost always Muties, I would *not* use a .308 weapon against them.  Kill them with a .45 or .38 or something. That way you're not expending more ammo than you're looting from the corpses. Also if you equip the Scrounger perk, you'll have a chance of finding extra ammo when searching ammo containers. The extra ammo doesn't just show up in the container though; you have to make sure you hit the search button to take advantage of this perk.
---
It's too bad the character doesn't know that it's for stabbing, not slashing...
---
Lol. It had to be a trigger when responding to a person trying to present lies as facts?
---
/republican 
---
Personally, I hope the game can redeem itself because I do enjoy it despite its obvious flaws. I would enjoy PvP content with an actual purpose and impact on the game world.
---
As someone who moderated a high-pop minecraft server for years, I am frankly shocked this is the first time we've seen this, lol.
---
Someone is bored with the game, and wants banned.
---
I sever hopped around midnight EST right before the last update (TSE nerf)  and found them at the grafton vendors everytime. I bought 4 torso plans and 4 arm plans but could never find the legs. I've yet to see them again at any vendor unfortunately.
---
i've heard that rotating the camp device changes your FT load in but i can confirm, for me at least, that doesn't work. I built my camp at the devil's backbone, right next to the flag, and EVERY TIME i ft in i end up in the water. When i fist join the server i'm on the ground, but no matter where i FT from i end up in the same spot in the water, no matter where/how i locate my camp device. 
---
I can’t comment on your personal gaming experience but mats crafting the ballistic fiber I need I get from ammo bags strewn all
---
Over. This information and others are available through google 
---
The Gauss has plenty of bugs but the grounded mutation interaction is not one. Don't run grounded if you plan to carry a giant electrical weapon....
---
Can confirm u/MrGlayden has a sister and her mouth is party.
---
Source: Lock your windows...
---
I imagine it not surviving 2019. The player base is diminished and there are games coming out this year that the remaining players will move on to.  But nobody likes to hear reality *shrugs*
---
I think this is related to the sneaking bug. They will probably fix this in the next patch but I am afraid of what they might brake this time...
---
I'm using my eyes, your comment is telling bethesda renders bass guitars? 
---
I know! First time I used it, it did a stab animation but i'm just getting swings now...
---
This 
---
The low dps is sad, i'd use it as a main weapon if it was equal in strength to my 2H/fist weapons. Sadly, not even remotely close.
---
Level 140 now, I've not done a bunker run, no nukes but have hung around after the fact in nuke zones to search for nuked plant and a few squishy creatures. 
---
I've loads of the map yet to explore and quests to finish. Why rush through the game unless of course that's your shtick to bang boom then on to the next big thing, fair enough.
---
I agree with some of the OP's points but I'm just taking it easy exploring and enjoying the amazing environment BGS created, just started playing with mutations. 
---
Because this is BSG! These are some of the stupidest people on earth. There are talented artists, that is for sure. Credit where it is due.  
---
But programmers and designers are the worst in the industry. For example, the idiotic decision to base the durability of weapon on the fire rate. Result? You have absolutelly top notch futuristic weapon, that is capable of killing ONE MireLurk before it breaks. Greaaaaat! Same with the talents and many other things.
---
Assault rifle: Very good recoil, but horrible damage and range. Sadly, it’s outclassed almost everywhere.
---
Radium rifle: decent against humans, but I’d just plain drop this in pve or against people in power armor.
---
Combat rifle: Cheap rifle with decent damage, but a bad recoil problem
---
Handmade rifle: better in every way in all categories (wtf it’s A HANDMADE RIFLE, HOW IS IT BETTER THAN A MILITARY GRADE ASSAULT RILFE) 
---
True stuff: bad, unless you use shotguns
---
Stabilized stuff: generally good on assault rifles. Use the FORCEFUL stock for more durability, and the aligned barrel if you want a cross over of hip and recoil stability
---
Use the perforating mag. Guns need all the armor piercing effects they can get
---
Reflex on everything but the AR, just leave it iron sight, all else is clunky.
---
Depends on perks, but if you don’t have any perks, use auto receivers with perforating mags, it’s the better option for an uninvested build or melee, but if you do want to rifle build, go with semi, cause autos don’t really get better with perks.
---
First Karma needs to kick Bethesda right in the butt.
---
As this would be exactly the moment the internets would explode with #theyStoleFromWoW whines. 
---
Probably just took him 2 years to get it to snap together right. I am working on a camp based on his video, very slight variation and I find myself needing to move the little half walls at the top that give it a castle like look. The game keeps saying "you cant move that or something else won't be supported". WTF. It's a half wall at the top of 3 other walls and nothing else is connected. "Nope, you  want move that or something else won't be supported". Bah, finally just logged off last night. I've already dumped a few hours in lining the base up right since foundations are wonky if the ground isn't bare and perfectly flat, and now near the end it starts this crap? Blah. So yeah lol the video makes you think you're Bob villa but after a couple of hours I just felt like a 2yr old with the oversized legos.
---
I came in to write exactly your first sentence but I guess that I'll just give you a slightly grumpy upvote instead ;) 
---
To expand a little on the idea I feel that most games that get turned into pure tedium do so to mask the lack of content. 
---
If players are constantly kept busy with farming materials to repair their items and food and drinks to stay alive, maybe players won't realize that there actually is zero real endgame content - or so they thought.
---
What? Man, good luck.
---
You need to tie together two clues.  One is on the HeadMistress's computer, the other one is found on a computer upstairs in the manor (there's more than one computer up there).  Together the two will tell you where they were going to meet.
---
You must like throwing money away lmao

Weird. I have my camp by top of the world and the cutthroat camp. Always have level 68 super mutants or level 40 glowing mole miners spawn there and can take them out in chameleon with no issues. I do have 2* sneak peek card on though.
---
Not sure about that.  I still roll with a shotgun TSE and with the right perks it’s about 220ish on damage.   My Hunter Dragon is still 270.  That’s plenty. 
---
The problem is things are breaking more frequently and rolling in PA isn’t my favorite but far less tedious than crafting or repairing body armor non-stop. 
---
Oh, and my modded Super Sledge is solid but still needs to be repaired far more often than it should. 
---
Insert Trump heavy breathing here lol
---
It is a weird design choice, 
---
I think opening Vaults and then have a PvP only server would make it cool for you to choose what Vault you start at
---
Having a few hundred hours in, I think the game wasn't designed to have you harboring one set of armor or a single weapon type for a significant amount of time.  I normally go through rotations of full-time PA to Full-Time Melee to full time TS Handmade.
---
With armor, I highly recommend spec'ing up the Fix It Good perk card so you can put everything to 200%.  Doing that plus not obsessing on keeping/fixing old armor and just replacing it for similar armor is a much healthier way to play.
---
Yeah I'm not logging in every day to sell some arbitrary 200 caps worth of crap to 7 vendors. That's not some kind of fun gameplay loop for me.
---
Hope you find a good therapist.
---
Also what system are you on? If you're on Xbox, I can craft you a full set of armor and perhaps some better weapons, too.  I have more ballistic fiber at this point than I know what to do with.
---
I wouldn't say harder just more resource intensive.  They are trying to artificially lengthen the game by making things take longer with out increasing content or entertainment value.  They should be bug fixing to increase the challenge so enimies do just freeze and I mow em down or see em in the t-pose and just snipe em out before they react.  Making loot less attractive for the sake of "balancing" a fallout game is just a waste of resources till after the bugs are gone 
---
Perks which 'cost' +1 to load are generally pretty good, like LW --
---
LW2 [1st rank] = 10% DR, 10% AP Regen
---
LW3 [2nd rank] = 15% DR, 20% AP Regen 
---
LW4 [3rd rank] = 20% DR, 30% AP Regen
---
You’re asking for economy balance in a game that has had duping and a caps exploits months after launch. There’s no repairing the economy lol
---
The reason hello games worked on no mans sky was because they were a small indie studio and they could do what they want with regards to funding and time distribution , bethesda dont see it profitable enough to invest in a game that was this much of a disaster. If they would release a game this shitty do you really think they would bother spending money trying to fix it?
---
I only put points in for the lone wanderer perk and the one that makes fast travel cheaper.
---
Similar here, not really a huge problem
---
My tse dropped from 880 to 220. Most melees if they are half decent can hit for 1k easy. Maybe tse did need to be nerfed, but 200 something damage for the best weapons in game when melee is averaging at four times that damage is just stupid. 
---
no ,    
---
You will find many more later. 
---
You would be wasting your money. It shouldn’t even be a question, save your money or buy a different game
---
Melee isn't op. Everything else just suck.
---
Don't nerf melee, buff the rest.
---
Man, loot is a total disaster right now. I don't really want anything and have no motivation to farm the slot machine rng. 
---
Since challenges are account bound and not character bound, you should be able to make another character that can leaves vault 76... I think.
---
It's a pole with a pointy bit on it. Not too hard to imagine.
---
Depends. How much will you be paying for it? It’s worth it for the first 30 or 40 hours so consider that. 
---
The vaults could potentially break into cave systems. This way they can be huge. Although maybe they are populated with human npc's that add more factions or quests to the over world.
---
Hopefully they add some more nukable areas that spawn giant boss badguys too. Giant deathclaws, robots, mutants, etc.
---
It comes down to the fact that, when given nothing for so long, even the slightest addition is something to be excited about. People will keep talking until it releases, then the hate will fly as it will be a buggy, broken mess for the first month.
---
its an MMO create a new character.
---
Depends on what they are and if they fit your character build.
---
Regular (non legendary) weapons are really abundant in the game. use them for scrapping,  
---
153. No joy on any of them after hopping a few times yesterday 
---
It happens to me every now and then.  I usually just hit the "Transfer" button instead of of watching the arrows spin. If there's anything actually there, it will come right up and you can remove it from the transfer window.
---
For a while i wore the civil war suit and sack hood with hoses. I felt like Scarecrow from Batman.
---
Then i upgraded to drifter outfit and gas mask + mining helmet. Now its silver shroud trenchcoat and either marine tactical helmet or enclave officer hat + gas mask.
---
The answer is no , Fallout 76 is the still born fetus of the gamming industry , if bethesda weren't so greedy they would have given the game more time to be created and then maybe we might have been left with a playable game.
---
Agree, if you going to make a crap Melee weapon deal 3x the damage of a two show explosive gun at least let us move our perks to the new meta you created.
---
Btw I believe Lone Wanderer and Action Boy/Girl don't stack - not sure if this was ever fixed? 
---
Spears are mad underrated..I have a vampire spear :)
---
Yeah, like they may be in Florida, or Oregon. You never know what state someone is in.
---
*had a sister
---
I gave the game many opportunities, it has disconnected me several times at the end of a silo, even after launching a missile let's hope they do not take a lot of time to get him out of his early access status why is it sad 
---
Patient Zero*
---
I don’t even follow this sub/ play the game anymore. I just come back here for pure entertainment watching the dumpster fire unfold. It’s more fun than the game
---
It generates it at the correct rate BUT it can only hold 5 at a time.
---
So if the storage "fills up" with 5 items, it stops.
---
It's a stupid design.
---
Lets say, Carl casually plays Fallout 76 and checks the enclave vendor every day. He probably get his desired Jet Pack and Calibrated Shocks in the next 2-3 years.
---
I've done that when this has happened to me. It doesn't fix it. You didn't read the part where it just arbitrarily deletes stuff from your camp. Your camp is officially still there, but stuff has been deleted from it. The items are gone forever, no amount of server switching fixes it.
---
My point is that this game is not going to improve anytime soon , but until then use the space for better games. 
---
Grafton train station was my go to stop for the BoS armor plans.  I just checked in game and it isn't on the plan list for the vendor when I checked.    I do think there is some small amount of randomness for what plans show up at vendors still or its a bug which isn't to far fetched given everything else in this game.     I say this because I have been looking for the stone bench plans for a rather long time.   I have always been told that Grahm has it as one of his rare plans.    Well I have ran into him twice since the patch and he has yet to have the plans.   
---
I see several mentions of no one finding leg plans.   This could be entirely coincidental but after finding the Heavy Combat Torso and Arm plans on vendors I cannot locate the Heavy Combat Leg plans on the vendors.
---
I highly doubt that performance or server strain have anything to do with the lack of humanoid NPC's. 
---
Remember that all of the enemies are NPC's too! Adding some more neutral or friendly NPC's with a few lines of dialog and some quests shouldn't be a problem at all.
---
Thank you :D
---
I noticed this too when, on a whim a couple days back, I decided to build a water CAMP to harvest it for selling.  Put in four of the big Industrial Water Purifiers that are supposed to produce 60/hr.  It all looked valid, but I was getting hardly any water from them.
---
Some past posts on this topic have suggested that 5 water ends up being distributed across all of the ones you've placed, which makes no sense, but is consistent with what I saw.  It's almost like your CAMP is only allowed to generate so much water.  It's either that, or the possibility that you get diminishing returns from a single body of water.
---
Just FYI I can do all those mods if you're ever in the market. We can get you running around in style. 
---
Do you have any numbers of the player base? just interested.
---
I would have been less pissed about them screwing that up if they didn't even bother airing 3 seconds of a clip from that scene. The clip didn't even have audio either...
---
Oh bummer, this is a different thing then. Makes sense. 
---
Once the game becomes more of a chore, why bother?
---
Im playing a game for **fun**, not to be punished. 
---
What is ridiculous is we have to do all of this out-of-game. There isn’t any text chat or trading hub. If they really want to encourage a player market, they should stop making it so hard to trade. 
---
I agree. It's as if Bethesda wants people to spend more time in the game, but the only way they can think of doing it is to make people grind more.
---
Well people are just going to quit rather than face an increasing grind treadmill...
---
Why complain about something that has not even happened yet. Oh wait...let me grab my crystal ball. 
---
I mean, they could do anything, but there isn't really any indication they will do any of that. I think people are starting a new hype cycle that these vaults are going to fix the game and add everything it's missing when it's very possible it's just gonna be building #22432 with scorched and a couple terminals and people are setting themself up for disappointment when march comes and it's not the real launch of fallout 5 now with NPCs.  
---
I live right next to the Alpha site, and I've often offered to people to friend me so they have a tether to the server if they get booted.
---
They take me up on it - and use it - fairly often.  It's gotten very bad since the last patch.  
---
That's a lot of work to have it fail.
---
No, relevant means appropriate to what is being done or considered. Relative is proportionate to something else. The prices people ask for should not be based on what they saw or heard of someone else selling them for. They should be based on what the items value are in the individuals at that time. Like my example, the guy with 100s of cores would probably want next to nothing for a few cores. But to the guy that really needs one and has 15k caps, spending 500 caps on one isnt a problem. The same guy that has 100s of cores could sell them for 5 caps or 500 caps depending on the situation and what both players agree on as relevant value. 
---
if the AP in FO4 and FO76 work the same, they are multiplicative and start with largest number first.  
---
AP is 50%, "Superior armor penetration" (Perforating Magazine) is 40% (from FO4).  
---
50 &gt; 40.  
---
If 100 armor, AP takes that to 50, Sup. AP takes remainder to 20 (50*0.4=20) for a total of 80% AP.
---
I think you can find plan at dropsite c2 north of watoga
---
Ugh, I cannot disagree more. Although, they do say some amusing things, vendors speak too frequently. It is obnoxious going to a vendor and having them shout into my headphones constantly while I buy and sell.
---
By level 20 you should be almost done w the story. Think I finished everything but the nuke by lvl 34.  I purposely prolonged it by exploring slot more on the 2nd playthrough since I understood how to build my character better by then.  But you definitely have to search out more story/holotape content outside the main quest. 
---
The fire breathers' final quest? If so, not normal unless you are also that level. I just did it at level 27 and it was all fairly useless stuff.  I think there was a submachine gun, but with terrible stats and level.
---
“I hope you think of me when you kill something with one of my guns.”  Raider vendor at top of the world. 
---
I would gladly accept a wanted bounty and burn it to the ground. Repeatedly. 
---
So it happened again.  I'm at the Charleston station in my Excavator armor with a friend and some idiot griefer comes running along wearing a monster mash head and starts repeatedly punching us with a power fist.  He's babbling something to his friends about how he takes down level 100 people with one punch.  I guess he didn't know he was broadcasting on area.  Mind you he was level 54, I am 119 and my friend is 114.  I try to fast travel away, but "You cannot fast travel while you are taking damage". He's got marsupial so I can't get away from him for a second there, Finally, I leap off a building and fast travel while in mid air.  My buddy says he tried to "add friend" him - we aren't that stupid.  We searched but could not find him on the map (and he wasn't  crouching at all) so he must have blocked us.  We blocked him and resumed playing the game.
---
He everything.......
---
Hence why i would like them to say more spice it up a little 😂 it amuses me every time but we are all different i guess lol 
---
By burn through ammo I mean you don't deal enough damage based on how much ammo you consume.  The dps you're getting vs how much ammo you consume is unsustainable because how much ammo you are using for such a small amount of damage.  The LMG is the absolute worst weapon in the game that isn't a joke weapon.  It uses .308 yet burns through it just as fast as the minigun burns through 5mm.  The difference is .308 is much rarer and crafted at a rate of 12 at a time while 5mm is crafted at a rate of 100 a time.  These weapons fire at similar speeds and do similar damage yet one is using the same ammo as a fucking sniper rifle.  Both weapons are shit but the LMG takes the shit cake.  That is what I mean by burn through ammo.  The effort required to farm up and craft all that ammo just isn't worth it for what you get out of it.  I used the .50 cal a lot and that can use up a hell of a lot of ammo but the difference is it deals damage so even though I'm spraying down enemies, they're actually dropping dead.
---
But really, fuck all of this.  This game should be a run and gun shooter since I can use a baseball bat just as good or better than any gun.  That baseball bat requires no ammo, the only thing it needs is wood and adhesive when it breaks.  A gun will take steel, springs, screws, oil, etc.  You can't expect me to treat ammo as a valuable resource like this is a survival game if I could just swear off guns and their bullshit and just walk up to shit and crack its head in with a bat easily.  A melee user is just as effective as a gun user only they don't have to deal with as much bullshit with stockpiling resources to repair guns and craft ammo.
---
Ya, that certainly could be. They really need to add more end game content for players. The current quests are pretty good but they do get a bit old. They need raid style events.
---
Your best bet is to just find something else to play and wait for the Year 1 "whoops we really fucked up!" patch that adds a bunch of amazing QOL changes.
---
Spoiler tag would have been nice. I’m still in the middle of this quest and did not realize that’s how it turned out.
---
Wait, your cores drain faster due to speed demon?
---
Bombs fell on Preston Garvey...
---
I just rerolled my character and am attempting some genuine roleplay for the first time ever. I’m going for a rockabilly style gang member, more Tunnel Snakes or UP Deathclaws than Atom Cats (mostly because the Atom Cats seem like too nice of guys for this character).  It’s been fun so far trying to fit my outfits with the correct armor, perks, and weapons. My first toons just did what they did and wore whatever struck my fancy at the time. Playing intentionally takes more time and thought, stories like yours inspire me when I’m frustrated.
---
I hope someday to see a post on Reddit that your novel is available for purchase!
---
I agree 100% but...
---
That's a LOT of work. Writing, voice acting, scripting, developing, etc. That's practically another entire game. I have a hard time believing that Bethesda is willing to invest that much money and effort into a game which they feel is already fit for release.
---
I am sure this game will go F2P by the end of the year.
---
Wait for the fanboi's and pure shills to show up and demand "proof".
---
I hope Bethesda read all these I give up posts, its the only feed back they actually need. They need to fix this shit and fast if they expect to sell Atoms any time soon.
---
Bethesda devs....BE BETTER!
---
Unless you have a person or two that is willing to waist the ammo and has to guns to cripple her down it's not worth it.  It's a melee game now.  When enough people quit they will fix it.
---
Lol ppl call this hard or grinding lol you don’t even know what grind is (RuneScape intensifies) 
---
But seriously it does not bother me seems more like balanceing this is a persistent online game things will get buffed or nerfed and changed is this your first online survival game or what? Ark and vocal say hello with all there daily changes 
---
I noticed this playing yesterday. My water depletes 2-3x faster than food and i'm going thirsty every 5-10 minutes max. it's not like a huge deal for me but i definitely noticed it. 
---
To give you an example: I was farming PA in Watoga and a trip from the top of the high school, through town, then to the top of the civic center i would have to drink 3 waters. Server hop and do the route the other way and would have to drink three more. 
---
No mutations, no drug use, no sprinting or vatsing. no combat. no team mates. 
---
I'm not at all interested in grinding things like in Skyrim.
---
Yep......patient zero and ground zero....that's why he had rad worms first don't you know!
---
Just based on your title... Agreed. I got a two shot gun that already feels powerful, if it was explosive it would be game breaking.
---
It's not a dedicated FPS as much as an RPG. Saying bullets should beat melee because it's realistic defeats the purpose of playing and violates Fallout lore going all the way back to game 1.
---
This would be a fun 1 point luck card. 
---
"Wild wasteland: 
---
Make random events even more random! Chance to earn extra loot from random events and new random encounters."
---
Sounds cool, got room in that crew? Haha.
---
Oh I'd wish that, too. Some day, perhaps. 
---
slow doesn't equal tedious. One can result from the other, but I can't blame them for slowing things down a bit.
---
Still better than Hearthfire.
---
your point about how "we know how it ends before we even start it" because everyone dies sounds really weak to me.
---
at least when it comes to everyone dying, we know that about real life as well. we're just on a different part of that timeline in FO76.
---
it's a bit reductive to say you know how it ends just because everyone dies, the point of the story (especially in games like FO76 where the story never truly ends) is the journey of it, not the destination. knowing what happened to the people that died and how we got to this situation is the core of FO76's story grip....
---
Thanks,  I don't think it'll be much longer for me to get them.
---
This week I'm going to finish Belly of the Beast and Enclave access.  At level 40ish with some sub-par setups I tried BotB, got to Glass Cavern but was exhausted after almost 5 scorch beasts.
---
Yesterday I went to turn in my Tech Data and a level 65 Scorch Beast happened to be there (I'm level 60 now) and I made short work of him with my regular modded, non-automatic Handmade.
---
Seems my new armor and weapon loadouts have made me stronger.  When I get on with my two regular teammates we'll likely mow thru the Scorch Beasts up to the Glass Cavern this time, and then make short work of the Enclave Bunker Buster quest line. 
---
I agree on all of those points except I keep hoping they do something to bring the game back, instead of this pvp survival mode I was hoping that they would have a cod style pvp mode tdm etc. After seeing one of the Dev rooms with all of the regular assets set up in an inclosed space with no entrance or exit and none of the boxes holding every item. It almost looked like a regular multi-player map from one of the bgs known for those kind of things, it had the big open center, two sides to run around and what almost looked like two spawn in areas for teams. Those were my hopes for what was coming in the new update and with the focus on the (albeit broken) pvp I was really gunning for this option.
---
 Hopefully they do something to turn everything around because all the praise aside for the halfway decent map and the in game lore actually being good compared to some games out today I tried to play for a handful of hours yesterday and just shut the game off after launching another nuke. I lied and told the person I was playing with that it crashed. 
---
Might have been. I remember them playing as a female character
---
Take my upvote you glorious SOB. We need people checking and understanding the code.
---
What is this Girl i hear so much about?
---
People cry for something to get fixed. Bethesda say they are fixing it. People cry even more.
---
They have said there’s no truth to those rumors.
---
Only hip fire, aiming is unchanged..
---
Has anyone seen them since the patch last week?  I have spent hours and not seen them at all yet.
---
haha, that's pretty fun. don't take it seriously it's not worth the time.
---
Why is it everytime someone makes a post about PvP idea's it can be paraphrased as:
---
&gt;I don't want people who are looking to pvp to be able to damage me, but I want to be able to kill without consequence, anyone who engages in pvp
---
This right here is KILLING this game. They scrapped durability in Skyrim and FO4. Turns out, there was a reason for that. Sure we needed a resource sink...but item durability isnt it. It never adds anything, and it always adds tedium. 
---
Here's an idea: Want to make a game about collecting resources? Try giving your players new, fun, innovative things to DO with those resources. Like, maybe, rebuilding civilization? Building new cities? 
---
But no. Why do that, when you can just go with old, tired and easy instead?
---
Realy?? Goddam** 😤
---
First, I started another character. I already had a badass, so I went with fun. 15 luck vats stealth build. I walk from vendor to vendor, doing events as I go around to gather the days caps.
---
About to hit 100 with my alt, not much left.
---
Yesterday, I played a diffrent game.
---
I held off, but I finally did it and tested straight away, can still sniper an SM in the head from 200m away..
---
For your questions:
---
1. Ur missing out much potential. There many mutations that benefit u with extra damage like adrenal reaction, eagle eyes or give u advantages in mobility like marsupial and speedster.
---
2. No
---
3. If u need to reallocate skill points, I suggest taking strength down to 5. Get rid of pack rat  barbarian and sturdy frame. Take bandolier and either traveling pharmacy or blocker.
---
Perception looks good.
---
Take endurance down to 1 for Radicool rest is still crap, or make it 4 if u experience a lot of griefers with TSE weapons and get fireproof too.
---
Charisma is fine
---
Intelligenz : 10 is fine, but get rid of Scrapper, it's useless. It gives u like 1 more steel when disassembling weapons. Pharmacist also useless.
---
U will stock up with way too much rad away as u progress in the game. Me, for example have like over 200 of it. Get batteries included instead to stuck up on fusion cores and reduce their weight.
---
And  power patcher and power user.
---
Power user u can swap out later , since u will have enough fusion cores to not care about them running empty. Consider gun Smith for extended weapon durability or demolition expert if u have an explosive gun.
---
Agility: I found sneak abilities not to be very useful overall, since enemies will detect u further or later anyways and in Nuke Zones and SBQ Event in won't be able to stealth effectively at all. Take action boy  and adrenalin. Born survivor saved my ass more often as I could even count.
---
I run this with all my builds. Also gun fu is a funny skill if u use it right. I usually headshot enemies in close combat situations with a lever action rifle and this skill automatically swaps to next target and targets its head. The damage bonus is still good too. But rank one is enough, like born survivor and adrenaline.
---
Luck could be higher if u want to make use of mutations.  Starched Genes and class freak are mandatory then. I also like to use tormentor for the crippling effect, Bloody mess for 15% more damage and grim reapers sprint for the AP refill.
---
That works fine with my said close combat headshot tactics
---
That's all 
---
All guns suck until you put 6-10 levels of perks into a SINGLE TYPE. Real fun. Because fuck variety and experimentation. 
---
Am pretty sure I remember the BoS modification will not allow the Atom Shop armor paints...  Might be different now, but that was something complained about when the game launched.
---
No, previously people were confused about the meaning of "stealth nerf" - people started using it to mean a nerf done stealthily, but others took it to mean a nerf TO stealth and ran with that til they were both roughly equal in the narrative.
---
This is different because people are saying and meaning a nerf/change to stealth. 
---
I try to be at least a little skeptical when people claim they're noticing changes on how something functions in the game, even if I initially think that it lines up with something I've noticed. Long story short I really do think something was changed somewhere because stealth is just not quite the same. Maybe they fixed some value that was amiss and now it's functioning as intended. I really don't know. But I'm definitely getting detected more, and more quickly and nothing about my build had changed in quite a while.
---
Used to be able to basically bump into really low perception enemies. Now even those will notice my max stealth, chameleon not-moving ass from what now feels like very far away 
---
It would be great, find some npc But knowing Bethesda, surely everyone is dead.  I wish I was not as sad as a silo, Ichallenge and dificult  my balls 
---
Cheers, hip fire only makes sense
---
Yeah, they wouldn't even have to add nowhere near as many friendly NPC's as in a singleplayer game, though. 
---
Just *some* more here and there would go a long way. 
---
They may not even have to be active to everyone at all times, like you mentioned in your other post. They could have them unspawn when no player is in the area. Or only have them spawn in triggered random encounters to begin with. 
---
I really don't think technical limitations are a good excuse. There are many ways they could do this.
---
Oh god this. Try putting a map marker near Black Titanium Ore deposits. Then walk to one.
---
Bam!! Shitbeast. Time to server hop, because level 30 gear CANNOT fight one of those things. And this happens even at the edges of the Forest. 
---
I'm not.  I'm actually now where I expected.  
---
I didn't leave the safety of the Forest for a long time, basically until I was almost level 50.  That meant that my Excavator Armour was maxed out when I built it.  I had a boatload of hit points and dozens of stimpaks and purified water for health.  
---
As a result, once I hit 50+ and got a TS Gatling I as never really in danger of dying from anything as I radiated out into the Mire/Savage Divide.  
---
Now I have harder fights on my hand and I welcome it.  Now I have to fight smart or the enemies can kill me, or swarm me.
---
Why is there a cap limit on vendors anyway? Why can't there be some real economy in this world? And where do the caps go when you pay for fast travel and workshops?! 
---
Not the most fun for sure but once I found the first one I really wanted a matched set. I did other things between the mind numbingly repetitive runs into the bunker. 
---
Sounds like you got a good plan moving forward my friend. I wish you all the luck. You'll be there before you know it. But if you need anything in the meantime the offer still stands. 
---
aint hard enough. like to see more or better AI, quests that involve more thought and challenge, but still, its a game of checks and balance - you dont get it all-  a bit more maturity,  and on that subject - can we please move the 12 year olds / murder death kill / to their own play pen. And it ranks to watch someone level up from 18 to 100 in less than an hour. Ive spent 3 months to get to level 50 ligit.
---
I don't seriously believe it has one.  It's been 3 months and nothing I've seen would suggest they have the capacity for miracles.  Instead, they struggle to do the most basic things.  I mean, look at how many Events are outright broken and consider how simple they are from a gameplay standpoint.  They can't even get the proper enemies to spawn at the proper time.
---
It's a trade off from the RNG governing if you ever find those plans.  
---
It should be possible to get the daily sell from one vendor, agreed.
---
Why would they put it there? I mean obviously they're a total moron, but there are not that many new people/new characters. I'd be surprised if even 5 people ever see it.
---
If they wanted to be seen they should have built at whitesprings.
---
Not sure what weapons you are taking but @L31 I can 1 shot a level 10 super mutant pretty consistently. The game has been made a bit more tedious but at the same time its designed to be played cooperatively so it isnt necessarily directed at solo play. 
---
That's why I labelled it as a symptom, it still really affects it. I could manage with -12% damage, but not the -75% I get currently
---
Happens all the time.
---
This just made my day, lmao! I love the imagination, this is what makes this game interesting, when thing are not so great at times! It makes me want to continue to play the game, it's because of the diversity players bring to the table. You got my vote for player of the week. 
---
You don't need a TSE to test - normal explosive weapons can be used to test out explosive effects.  They are just too slow firing to be practical for the queen fights though, except for the auto grenade launcher.  But the AGL has its own issues (heavy, heavy and expensive ammo).
---
TSEs were utterly broken but people who had them obviously are feeling the pain now.  Meantime those of us who didn't use them, are just doing fine today.  Its understanding the mechanics that will get you a long way towards killing the queen.  And melee isn't that great, its way slower per hit than most semi auto/auto weapons.
---
Just following the main quest line is a huge pain. If you don't grind for ages, it's super easy to hit a difficulty wall at level 20 when you get to Rose.
---
The longer this game lives, the harder and harder it will be for new people to join.
---
Yeah, I had a strange session this weekend. I seem to have the bug (maybe not a bug?) where I seem to be constantly in caution, even at my very peaceful camp. I went to the capitol building in Charleston, entering via the roof, and kill the first mutant on the top floor with my suppressed rifle. Within 10 seconds, waves of mutants come bounding through an open doorway, to the point where this was just this huge mass of meat piles covering the floor (had to be close to 20). Eventually, I sneak down to the basement and the same thing happens, just swarming in even though I had sneaked down there. In contrast, my other pre-patch experience was picking them off maybe 3 or 4 at a time. I'm not saying that the game isn't working as designed, but I can't quite figure out what the design is given such different experiences.
---
Sanskrit I thought, means peace and prosperity.
---
I'd test it for yourself if you can. I dropped Action Girl to add in stuff like Mr Sandman or a full Adrenaline 
---
Well first, something i have noticed playing with new players.  They want to upgrade and repair stuff WAY too much when leveling.  I don't repair anything till 30+.  I usually find more then enough base items to make it to 30 with no trouble.  After 30 I usually upgrade my guns for more damage when it starts to matter, and i have more then enough mats because i have been hording them for 30 levels.
---
Second, server hop for cores and PA.  I pick up my first PA at level 4-5, and by the time i am 25 have a set of 30,35,40 in the stash.  Even with the power drains its easy to make PAs last.  Don't use vats in PA, def don't use vats in PA with a auto it will destroy a core.  Take the power plant and get 8 cores an hour.  Even if your making non PA build, use PA to level.
---
Third, builds matter.  As others have stated, you have to focus on what you want to do in game. (unless melee)
---
That will do exactly nothing though. A picture of a camp doesn't say who it belongs to.
---
Yes exactly what you said...
---
Go to Watoga, use melee and just kill all of the robots. Server hop, rinse and repeat. You will have massive amounts of lead and steel from doing this. Equip super duper and ammo smith and craft away
---
Thanks for this, now I can be more comfortable as a mutated rad sponge :)
---
No but the latest trends in conversation through various social media platforms would suggest not very good numbers. 
---
I saw Mothman in the wild 3 times yesterday on my new character. 😂
---
Only ever saw him once on my main. 
---
Dang that sucs. I feel like your wasteland weapon could definite your character but they really make it hard with the way the gun load out works
---
Fallout 76 really needs NPCs back.
---
I've reached a higher level in the game, playing mostly in PA at this point, but I remember the ballistic fiber grind.  I like helping lower-level players to have something new to do at this point!  If you're playing on PC, send me your username.  I'll meet up sometime and share my ballistic fiber/junk - free of charge! :)
---
Radpression? 🤔
---
Yea, that's it. I'm level 18, one of the weapons was a huge LMG at level 50!
---
Yeah, I'm just waiting for the inevitable big melee nerf. With the White Knight nerf, what bugs me with that is that they said they didn't want it to feel like a compulsory pick. If they wanted to do THAT, they could have just increased armor durability. They didn't make it less a necessary pick those not using PA, they just made it less effective. 
---
On making it more tedious, I started a thread for this a bit back, and testing it now I can pretty much confirm: they seriously increased container respawn times. Used to be you could farm daily, now most regular containers appear to be three days and chem boxes, first aid boxes, and safes look like four, when I timed it. This is more a problem for lower level characters, higher level people probably haven't been impacted much if they notice at all, but at lower levels your options for farming are limited and the medical supplies in particular are pretty important for progression.
---
i mean, all that has been seen is the inside of the vault(s?). I don't think we can comment yet on what the content will be. we don't know what quests surround them, what NPCs might be in them, what they might even do to the current map. imo they are going to have to advance it some way anyway in order to sustain the game. it just wont make sense for them to have us continue nuking the queen over and over, with no real resolution.
---
additionally, I think they are going to open up new areas of the map. it might not be with vaults, but somewhere down the line. there is a pretty big gap on the west side of the map, on the other side of the river, that i think will be the site of something. the gap is 2x the size of the margin on the east side. 
---
however they do it, the map needs to change in some way. they were quoted a few times saying things like they "want 76 to last forever," or "as long as possible," or "years." im having a blast rn, but without a dynamic environment, a game like this will not last "years." not even close.
---
I gave up finding Calibrated shocks for X01. What I ended up doing was getting T60 legs with Calibrated shocks which are way easier to find with the rest X01. 
---
Spend more time playing that looking for these stupid shocks for X01!
---
That is not true. My melee build can only get up to about 360 for my Deathclaw gauntlet. But I don’t run unyielding, bloodied, or any damage perk besides level 2 slugger cards, iron fist 2, and incisor lvl 3. You only get 1k+ if you min max your build. I chose not to min max build, though I do run talons, twisted muscles, and herd mentality mutations. 
---
But it's so fun...
---
They fucked up the balance this badly because they simply do not care. I don't believe the devs are incompetent, I'm sure they knew how poorly balanced it was. 
---
They just didn't care.
---
I think it was actually the Overseer. The journal entry author has the same initials

 I do not intend to spend bullets on those flying sponges, if they find me, let me kill I will not spend hundreds of bullets for a leather chest and a toothbrush

Commando build from 0 to 61.  Guy uses the 10 smg from cold case, and it uses a lot of ammo but is fun as hell.  Build does a lot of damage.
---
They datamined it, the first vault is just a small area and a world quest [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Event:\_Race\_for\_the\_Presidency](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Event:_Race_for_the_Presidency)   
---
You just run around to all the ballot machines that are everywhere and whoever touches the most wins. Which seems very very much like they are making half hearted PvP content, not the PvE expansion people are hoping for. 
---
Great isn't it, and if you arent blinded, you're staggered so can escape either....

Cool story bro

It’s the smallest gang ever as I’m usually solo on the PS4 haha. All my friends are on xbox.
---
i think bethesda is going through growing pains with fo76.  they are a single player game company, they have yet to learn how to do balance changes, quick patches(without messing up old updates) and communication with the community.  these things are more of a blizzard thing, bethesda is JUST now starting to learn it's not as easy as it looks.
---
I do this too. Who says I'm suffering?
---
Oh yes must more important to report it though their bug report feature then complain about it on a sub reddit. But either way if the game broke they need to know how it broke so they can recreate it and fix it. 
---
So supporting documents are needed either way. 
---
Idk how to even respond to this. Obviously you can play however you want, but balancing is based on end game weapons and their perk cards. Choosing to not use something doesn’t count you into a balancing argument. That’s like saying your RP experience applies to the actual math of the meta and it doesn’t. 
---
Damnit Otto, you gained Lupus!
---
I too hate the lack of human npcs, and the knowledge that everyone is dead and ultimately nothing we do besides creating the vaccine and nuking the scorch beast prime lair matters to the world. But there are stories, and they are remarkably well voice acted. The Responders, Abbie Singh and the Brotherhood of Steel all have compelling stories. The problem is, yes, that we know they are all dead, and that takes a lot of the impact out. Hearing them makes me think "Boy, I wish I played that game."
---
That said, I honestly think this is just Phase 1 of Fallout 76 and it's story. The first act, if you will. It all deals with creating a vaccine to stop the spread of the Scorched Plague, discovering the nature of the various factions and their tactics, and ultimately nuking the main den of Scorch Beasts. 
---
All of that is basically laying the groundwork for resettling West Virginia. I think the next "act" will see NPC settlers arriving, and we the players refounding the various factions. Maybe we take back Harper's Ferry, Flatwoods, Top of the World, some area near Charleston, and Watoga, and those become NPC settlements based around the Free States, Responders, Raiders, Firebreathers and Enclave.
---
Even more support for my request to have new game + after finishing the story line. Higher level players need a new map where all enemies are 50+ and maybe have legendary bosses with mods like path of exile.
---
You know what's weird? I ran it again last night and had an easier time. Same set of scorched and super mutants mixed. Totally weird.
---
Ehh sorry, but SPECIAL respecs are a bad idea. You are able to change your character over time by just playing the game, the fact that that takes a little while is the only thing that gives characters any mechanical identity at all in the game. If they ever actually balance the game the people who stuck with their guns (literally in this game) should be the first ones to the newly viable builds, rather than just letting everyone who chased the meta instantly change to whatever the new thing is. Changing your character should be one of the long term goals to pursue in the game.
---
Nice find an thanks for sharing. Lot of people say they will share how an never do.
---
I feel like ghouls would be a great addition, easy enough to add in "intelligent" ghouls, they  arent human NPCs so the whole "the only humans are us" thing would still be preserved. 
---
After the last patch for me, the hotfix didn’t change it. I thought it might be related to the rad worms thing, which I hesitate to even bring up because I love it and don’t want you to fix it!
---

"We've added all of the mods to the vendors now.  The base cost of a bright headlamp has been changed to 23,000 caps.  Also, we have buffed vendors so they will now have an additional 50 caps per week."  
---
heh.
---
I have multiple water purifiers running.  I go to my camp, collect 15 water, make some soup for extra hydration, and head back out into the world again.  Also any time you're at your camp building or crafting, run over and grab those waters every 5 minutes or so if you're there that long. You'll be surprised how quickly they start stockpiling. 
---
That's why I experimented till I found a combo that didn't have that happen, that I could tell
---
Got my first TSE Saturday (Combat Shotgun). Yay?
---
had one time where there were 5.
---
needless to say, i just ran.
---
Yeah, it usually clears up if you check another   lootable object. At least for me.
---
Yeah this was fixed in December last year.
---
Really though, the wikis on 76 are still trash. No is updating any of them with solid info. 
---
Do you want a ragequit?   
---
Because that's how you get a ragequit!
---
No, because it hasn't. 
---
You have to repair your armor slightly more often for once extra ballistic fiber. That is not fucking hard.
---
You actually have to shoot an enemy more than once instead of one shotting them with a tse. That is not fucking hard.
---
Yeah, the source of damage can be toublesome.
---
If you have ricochet, and damage bounces off you you're considered the source for damaging other players or robot staff at The Whitespring.  
---
If you  blow up cars at the Whitespring you're going to piss of the robots, too.
---
The Tesla Coil armour mod also lights up robots if you're activated by a close ghoul.
---
So I try not to use these during nuke farming runs.
---
If they had player vending in from the start then there would be some kind of real economy. That would be a massive step forward.
---
The game is easy if u spec melee!
---
"I think we all think the bag was a nice idea. But, not pointin' any fingers, they coulda been done better."
---
Great idea, especially the statlist, so it’s easy to find the buffs you’re looking for. (INT for crafting, STR for hauling, etc.)
---
Ooh, nice catch!
---
I found all three Heavy Combat Armor plans at Watoga Station vendor.  But they were random.
---
Heavy Combat Legs on day 1.  Nothing for the next 3 days.  On day 5 I server hopped three times.  Got Torso, Torso, Arms.
---
So I am pretty sure the main plans are pretty random.  For Heavy/Sturdy Combat armor at least (Heavy/Strudy Leather are always available for any Responder vendor bot).  Never saw Light Combat plans for sale, but those come as rewards from the main missions thru Abbie's Bunker.
---
Never seen Marine armor plans for sale either.  Those have been spawning for me in BOS controlled (or, previously controlled technically I guess) areas.
---
I have yet to see Deep Pocketed or BOS Combat Armor mod plans at any vendor though, no matter the hopping.
---
Maybe, but don't hype yourself up thinking they are going to patch in a different game later. 
---
(I feel sure they will patch in "NPCs" though at some point, just because they can pretend people mean static models that bark, instead of people wishing for characters and interactions. I am sure some future thing will have 8 fallout 4 people models around or something to try to make headlines of "Fallout 76 adds NPCS!" without adding anything significant)
---
PC, but I can confirm all below happens to all platforms. Hope you find this feedback beneficial to work on the next patch.  
---
1) Mutation effects seem to come and go at random unpredictable times. Very frequently I find myself with only the negative effects. Rarely it seems the positive effects have increased - definitely noted it when I got Rad Worm disease. Sometimes this is reflected in the pipboy, but more often than not it isn't. Note that I do not take Rad-X or any other chem which might affect mutation effects, and I constantly keep maxed Starched Genes and Class Freak equipped. I'm not sure whether all of my mutations are affected at the same time, or whether it's only some of them. I notice it immediately that I have something wrong when Marsupial doesn't work but it's more difficult to determine with other mutations since they're not that evidently visible and the pipboy doesn't paint a true picture. Also I was in a team and as soon as one shared Strange In Numbers all my positive effects went away.
---
2) The damage output of my weapons varies unreasonably, within minutes at the same time of the day. It's not due to any perk card, chem, magazine or bobble head. I'm suspecting it might be related to the above mutation problem. For example I log in the game and my All Rise has 540 damage. I check in some minutes later and it's down to 370. I continue playing, check it at random and find it at 440. I can't figure out what's causing such variances or how I can avoid them. Same goes for my other weapons whether melee or ranged.
---
3) The \[CAUTION\] in red above my character seems to get stuck there. I'd kill all enemies, fast-travel away, even go inside Whitespring Resort to trade or use the crafting stations and it'll still be there. Kinda makes the Health Regeneration useless.
---
4) Some players are getting a higher damage output than Yao Guai, Deathclaws and Scorch Beasts, even the Queen herself. It makes no sense having players able to deal more damage than the end-game boss. Whenever I fight the Queen and I receive her damage while unsheltered in an open field my health starts going down quickly but she never 'one-shots' me. I still get the time to put a stimpack even while hitting her with melee. However there are players able to one-hit with melee in pvp though apparently they aren't able to do so in pve so this needs balancing. I'm not saying melee weapons should be nerfed but some of the perks (bloodied and serendipity for example) and probably also chems surely need to.
---
5) Same thing as above should have been done to TSE weapons. People were complaining because players with TSE weapons were one-shooting them in pvp. You nerfed TSE both for pvp and pve, whereas in my opinion you should have done it only for pvp. With my TSE pipe bolt action rifle which I found on a ghoul in the Penitent difference is negligible. Obviously I can still use it but need to fire 6 shots against a lvl 68 supermutant for example, whereas before I could kill them with 2 shots. People who complained about other players one-shotting the Queen with TSE weapons got it all wrong - it was not the TSE which was OP but the explosive bobble-head stacking. I heard you solved the bobble-head stacking (I never tried it personally) but honestly I don't think you should have messed with 2 shot damage or explosive damge.
---
6) Please make pacifist mode that the victim takes ZERO damage rather than a small percentage. Because with the issues mentioned above a lot of damage is done to the attacked player even if they're in pacifist mode. If you make it zero damage these issues won't arise at all. After all if a player is using pacifist it means they don't want to engage in pvp at all. It won't make difference to honest players whether they give them a 2% damage in pacifist. But cheaters gloat seeing a pacifist player's health go down by 30-50% with their first shot.  
---
It would also be more convenient if we can choose a hotkey to turn pacifist on/off. Navigating through the menu is cumbersome.
---
7) Several times I saw other players walking around, trading etc and they'd be in full chameleon effect (shimmering not just invisible). Isn't the chameleon effect whether by armor or mutation supposed to work only when the player is standing still?
---
8) When I equip 3 lockpicking cards my lockpick skill goes up to 4...
---
9) Other people's perk cards flash on the top left of my monitor and I hear the equivalent sound, even if I'm not in a team with them and not even friends and I don't have that particular perk equipped. It's how I know melee players who one-hit others to death are using the Serendipity card - it starts flashing on and off like crazy.
---
10) Server stability. ''Server not responding. Controls have been temporarily disabled'' sometimes flashes so quickly on and off that it makes the game unplayable. That and server disconnects. I'm sure it's not due to my pc specs or my ISP because I'd be in a team with 3 others from different continents and it happens to us all at the same time.  
---
Sadly, this has been happening with the same frequency despite duping methods being stopped and despite having players unable to carry more than 1500 on their person. I am totally against cheating but it was said that solving these would improve server stability, apparently they have not.
---
It's as if the game is... F2P. Kinda funny in a sense.
---
Terrifying how long this list is an it's not even complete.
---
Lol, I have a group of coworkers that I actually play with and we convinced one of our friends to start playing since the game was down to 20. I might have to try this.
---
looks like a good build, All my builds I make sure I have 8 points in Intl so I can use all the crafting perks. and I can't justify 9 perk points for the 60% more damage when it's only 3 for 30% Commando or Rifleman, I have to admit I haven't got beyond lvl 47 though. so not sure if I really need them.        
---
Carl is in luck. Surely the next patch will make them readily available now that I did it the hard way. That’s what happened once I finally got the handmade rifle plan. Still I love to explore future Appalachia but I’ll be spending much less time around Whitesprings for awhile. 
---
I’ve looked through the entries but can’t get the clues completed.  I’ll go back armed with empty holotapes or something lol. 
---
Honestly whitespring is better than the vault, just go there
---
i believe they changed it. it used to be 10 for the big one if im not mistaken. for whatever reason they thought it was an issue?
---
but then it's cool for us to be able to pick up unlimited dirty water with no containers? tf
---
Like I said, I get it. I found it annoying when multiple computers in the same building have duplicate entries and trying to work out which are unique, or when half the entries are corrupted with the same no data error message.
---
I still enjoyed the chit-chat though, regardless of presentation or subjective quality.
---
Then no one would play bloodied. As a rifleman my health stays at around 48hps... What's the risk vs reward if furious outperforms?
---
I would have liked them to implement a system to jump small walls without being an expert in parkour, Also be able to be with the whole body on earth, feel like a true sniper. or hide  
---
Same, so now I just wear power armor and am mad about Science not mattering, instead
---
Yes, and it gets much worse while in a nuke zone and/or with multiple players around. Nothing to do with my connection. 
---
Indeed, because what's the first thing I did when they nerfed Rank 2 White Knight?  Get Rank 3 White Knight.
---
Having to shoot an enemy more than once because Bethesda took your OP TSE away does not make them bullet sponges. And ammunition is only as limited as you are lazy. Steel, lead and gunpowder practically grow on trees, craft that shit. 
---
To keep people from exploiting things even more I would assume. So cloning items doesn't mean unlimited caps right away.
---
Also to make you think how you play. You can't just sell all junk every time you feel like it. It's supposed to be strategic. Real world vendors don't have unlimited money either. 
---
A lot of people will put them on free for mats.
---
i think bethesda is going through growing pains with fo76.  they are a single player game company; they have yet to learn how to do balance changes, quick patches(without messing up old updates) and communication with the community.  these things are more of a blizzard thing, bethesda is JUST now starting to learn it's not as easy as it looks.  they've shown their inexperience again and again, even as early as BETA.  even their interviews showed their naivete. i recall pete hines thinking people will act like NPC's and become vendors full time to be "specialized" in cooking special steaks for people?  LOL  todd howard saying this game will be so stable "you will never even see a server"???  or how todd howard claims this game "just works" despite the fact fo76 is just a copy and paste of their code from fo4, brute forced it into MMO mode.   
---
honestly i love fo76 but i accept its giant flaws.  i have low expectations at this point, i just play it for what it is: a buggy unbalanced mess of a fun time.   
---
That’s the smart play and what I should have done. 
---
Hey, man, I love Preston.
---
Because Bethesda lmfao. They’ll probably add it eventually once the other couple hundred bugs are fixed😂
---
Same mask + straight jacket + popping out of chameleon in front of someone = priceless. 
---
Yeah, that's why you got unplugged.
---
There's actually a few you can bulk, these can be sold indavidually to vendors. Also keep in mind bulking does not save weight on many items.
---
J42?  J42.  ....J42...
---
I’m barely level 15 right now and I mostly use a modded pipe revolver and it gets the job done in 3 or less hits sometimes one 
---
This happened to me the day of hot fix. My game went from fine to utter shit. I ran repairs an everything. Only fix was a complete reinstall.
---
Yea, the division 2 is coming out and that game has some of the most detailed and intricate builds of any game I ever played. At least the first one did 
---
Almost certainly not, if so - I want tips from the OP
---
There was a post last night and the info from it was deleted. It said there's a colorful forest with a tree in the middle and due north of the tree is a body of water that's not located on the map and the hatch is there under the water. It's also near a factory. But apparently you can't open the hatch unless you killed the Flatwoods Monster. When you enter said hatch you disappear from the world and it's an underground facility with aliens. I don't know if it was clickbait or not but you can't really expect people to give spoilers if they don't want too. However I haven't found any other posts about this 'underground facility with aliens' yet. So it very well could be bullshit.
---
Yeah I had one spawn behind me &amp; I just one tapped him with my TSE shotgun pre-nerf (such a fun fight right) but I was also disappointed there wasn’t any loot or anything. Just a floating alien (made for a fantastic screenshot) but I’m not trying to kill mythical creatures for a screenshot. I’d like some cosmetic item (outfit, hairstyle, etc.) for beating any of the mythical creatures. In a single player fallout they’d probably have thought about &amp; done this 
---
There's another thread I can't find atm with the breakdown for the current patch.
---
There's a steep diminishing margin of returns with both equipped, but it still shaves a 1-2 seconds off regen.
---
Whitespring has a toy store.  Usually full of toy cars, rocketships, and a fully assembly buttercup.
---
Gorge Scrapyard (Forest workshop north of Flatwoods) has a fully assembled Buttercup in the small shack next to the Junk Pile.  Also has a Mole Rat that spawns in there and usually causes it to blow apart into head/body/leg pieces.
---
Other than that, they are all over the place.  Houses and various places where people seem to have hunkered down momentarily are filled with toys for the little kids I assume were there at one time.
---
It's only 13% with maxed class freak perk
---
Well, technically it is not "your" camp. It is a public workshop, which means if you claim it, you are also opening yourself up to server-wide PvP against anyone who wants to contest your ownership of the workshop. After disconnecting, you'd also never see all the work you put into it again, since you would log in on a new server. Workshops were never meant to be a home and are transient by nature. You'd be better off to construct a personal camp and then just use workshops for resource harvesting. When I was in my level 20-30s, I had my camp on the hillside next to Lakeside and would just run down the hill and claim the workshop every time I logged on. You can pretty stockpile stimpacks, plans, and various other junk that way since you always get rewards for defending it. 
---
I'm on PC.
---
We already played the future of Fallout, so we know that besides the raiders, no one will ever take up the banner of the WV BoS or the Responders.
---
*one shots a spawn and wants a cosmetic outfit drop
---
Not true. He just didnt use turrets and crops that I see. Crops/moomoo also use alot of budget. 
---
I am lvl160 and my budget has stayed the same for as long as I can remember and that's like the only thing left to do in the game is build shit so i move and rebuild alot. It also helps me keep my stash size down since I'm using junk all the time. 
---
It's not a gun, it's an ammo autoscrapper.
---
Yup that's all I got from it was a cool screen shot
---
Yeah I saw it, also saw a second post that has since been removed where the guy just kept repeating "Middle of the map" when anyone asked for anything. I just personally believe that if you're going to share something really cool you found on here, at least have some proof to back it up or give a better idea of where to start looking. Not just "middle of map" or "colorful forest/factory" cause there's a LOT of forest and a few different factories.
---
The game isn't hard it's just annoying because shit breaks so fast
---
Don't run Grounded with it at all.
---
take the poseidon workshop, and power up the fusion core processor.
---
Another whiny post from some person who’s barely played the game 10 hours. 
---
This game is easy man. And when I say easy, I mean you can tank the hardest enemy in the game with 10 of her minions simultaneously hitting you, all with a low hp/high dmg build. 
---
You need to do research, you need to learn, you need to stop expecting to one shot enemies when your Tse or your toon specced with no damage perks. You need to learn how to sneak, how to headshot, how to play smarter.

I’ve been hoping eventually they would release a PvE mode with greatly increased difficulty and yet here a bunch of you are STILL here complaining about “muh TeSsE ain’t 1 shuttin em no mo”.. You people are a fucking joke and need to go play Minecraft or fortnite or whatever easy no skill or effort game lazy dumb people play nowadays. 
---
They also said that all patches go through strenuous QA before release....
---
That's a very good point.  I compared my play time and level in Fallout 4 to Fallout 76 and in like a month and a half I reached level 100 in 76 whereas in hundreds of hours in 4 I'm at level 112.  They needed to slow things a bit especially when only the first 50 levels really matter.
---
PvP in Destiny is the worst PvP if any video game in years. Bungie is almost as bad as Bethesda at balancing anything pvp related. PvE is next to none though, raids &amp; the environments are not only cool but very interesting to just explore. Same feeling I had when first playing 76. After a while it’s the same shit though. Destiny 2 is really grindy also, sometimes you can do a good month grind &amp; barely get rewarded. Now that I’m typing this I’m seeing a lot of similarities between 76 &amp; D2 lol. 
---
This will help you get more if you want. They reset every 20 hours apparently.

The wiki says it can take a serrated electrified mod.

I'm talking about fallout 4
---
Turrets are useless. Get yourself a better weapon an deal with intruders yourself. I've build over 70 camps an never once built a turret. Best ways to stretch budget are limit lights / roofs / foundation  / upper floors. Those all take significant amounts of budget. 
---
The problem isn't that it's harder - it's that they are finding ways to make it more tedious and slow things down.  None of this makes the game more difficult - it makes it more *annoying*.
---
Dor armor, look into the White Knight perk (makes armor decay slower and reduces repair costs) and Gunsmith (guns decay slower and you can craft better gun mods).  For crafting ammo, perks like Ammosmith (produce more ammo per crafting) and Super Duper (random chance of producing a duplicate crafting) are useful.
---
Identify the things you need most.  Ballistic Fiber is typically found in military bases, including the ones scattered around the Cranberry Bog (if you're Lv. 30, you may not have seen them).
---
You will save a lot of ammo if you have some kind of melee weapon, especially for those low-leveled enemies.  Something like a Baseball Bat or Fire Axe doesn't weigh that much in the grand scheme of things.
---
What weapons are you using?
---
Yes, haven't seen it in a while, but all last night half the corpses/containers I tried to loot would spin endlessly. Also had some instances where corpses I would loot would be shared with others in my team. Aren't these all supposed to be instanced for each person?
---
If it had Furious it could be good with its speed, but Idk
---
They seem to think there is this huge untapped player group just salivating to PvP. I think in all my play I have seen the Hunter versus Hunted prompt pop up less than 5 times.  I am in the mid 200s level wise, so I am just not seeing this burning desire for PvP. If there was wouldn’t players be using the mechanics already provided in the game?
---
basically overreaction is a sure sign of inexperience in the dev teams.  i was a hardcore diablo3 player.  early days they had man power to tweak, balance and TEST.  later on when all experienced crews left and they were left with few noob guys, they started just covering up balance issues with more DAMAGE and more DAMAGE.  its ridiculous but even noob devs know big DAMAGE temporarily shuts up most people.  
---
Sure hope no one builds a hollow foundation block tower over an acid vent or radiation source and lures players into it.
---
Pretty sure you cant fast travel taking damage :D 
---
... heh
---
K bye.
---
Sunshine meadows farm usually has one in the stables...
---
Even if you just have the power armour chassis with no pieces it's still a strength boost and your carry weight will increase. I'd go ahead and use it now honestly. I got raider power armor around level 15 anyways.
---
Yeah but... X01? Does anybody have a *plan* for X01 jetpack?
---
I'm not touching my main until they fork over a respec. Hopefully I play him again.
---
Even if it was a 2 for 1 system it would be better then nothing.
---
A real world explosive shotgun would blow a fucking hole in any creature you’re standing in front of.. now TSE’s tickle enemies knickers for god sake. so not a good idea to compare to real world lmao 
---
To all the enquirers Inhave received, your all welcome to join our group.  The above initial discord link should not expire.

Really, thats why the mass exodus is back and playing Cruicible and Gambit more than ever?
---
Destiny 2 had issues from Fall of 2017 until June 2018, but has since been revitalized. I was one of the steadfast that played D2 during this dark time, and you are right— it was terrible... times have changed.l tho.
---
What Rad Worms thing?
---
I think one spawns at the amusement park in the top left corner ... It's usually in the portapotty
---
Can you steal the toys from white spring?
---
Yea, the raider set is level 15. I don't really want to start using power armour already since I feel like you end up using it for the majority of the game, and I want it to feel like more of an achievement when I get a full set of gear.
---
Another tip:
---
1.)Drop the close-to-spoiling food
---
2.)Craft 1 new piece of the same food that you dropped
---
3.) Pick up clos-to-spoiling food.
---
Result: Food condition restored
---
Less nerfing, mor buffing builds/items that are not desired in the meta. My humble opinion.
---
I am replying to your comment “even half way decent melee can do 1k damage” (not a direct quote). It just is not true. And yes melee at this time is better then builds, but to make it better you have to invest the points to do it. 
---
I think the lmgs spawn in at 30-50 and are well worth scrapping so you can get those mods for them early. The legendary varients even though the damage isn't high are really good with the right effects. 
---
Classic low int Fallout dialogue
---
LMFAO where is the Porta-Potty?
---
Seems like people agree with you. I do not... Sorry but I have 2 character, one level 12 and one level 74. I have like, just over 100 hours. I am by no means spending an ass of time on this game like other people on this sub. I have no problem at all keeping my armor repaired. I have lots of extra ballistic fiber. Ammo is always a challenge to keep up but I usually have anough for at least one of my rifles. But hey, ammo should be expected to be hard to come by in the wasteland. I have no problem at all getting 1400 caps a day at the vendors. I don't even have 1 of the white knight perks on either character. I never have picked it my entire play time with this game. It's a little harder pre level 50 but it's not supposed to be easy. Ask me why I made a new character? The game feels like more of a challenge again. I'm discovering things for the first time all over again. I wanted my main character to be the one I can hop to, to deal with hardr tasks and fights. I needed another to be more of a pack rat trader. I don't play this game a whole lot and I'm simply not having the issues you are. I'm not feeling the way a lot of people in this post are. I'm prepared for the downvotes but realize you're in an echo chamber here. Do something different if you're having issues. Don't come here to complain, keep doing what you're doin, and expect different results. 
---
Too bad foundations work like stairs so they could probably just walk up to the top 
---
I can’t one shot my friends now 
---
Me gwot bwig swad 
---
I don’t hip fire often anyway, bloodied mess taking up my luck
---
This is a very valid point.  While I'm cool with some of the tedium, I want it to be for something!  Right now, there is no end game... nothing that's a challenge that's worth killing.  Any legendary the SBQ drops, I can get from a ghoul at whitesprings without a nuke.  Any of the plans she drops I can get from a terminal or vendor now.
---
And as far as TSE goes... while I think they needed a nerf, I also think they hammered a little too hard... especially on that explosive dmg perk.
---
Fully perked out for TSE weapons, or even bloodied explosive.  At 30% health, with adrenal reaction... It would take 3 shots from a bloodied explosive or TSE lever action rifle to kill a level 68 super mutant.
---
Well this weekend, I did a hybrid build and took some melee perks.  I don't even have maxed rank on any of the perks and I'm back to one shotting level 68 super mutants.
---
This really feels like someone in management is listening too much to player base cries for changes, and not having enough evidence to make good decisions.  Yes, they needed a nerf... but perhaps some math would have helped.
---
That being said, I fully expect melee to catch the next nerf... 
---
Bro you can do 1k with all rise which is a quest reward everyone can get. 🤦🏻‍♂️. You picking a bad deathclaw to use and do 300 damage is on you. 
---
I'd think warning/resetting their FO76 character would be more in line, and at the extreme end, banning their FO76 account. Not their entire bethesda account, lol.
---
Man, buying games on sites where you don't technically own the game has been a huge fucking mistake. If Steam started going down this route, *maybe* people would realize the folly of product **licenses** versus product **ownership**.
---
I hardly wear power armor losing out on legendary effects is just too much of a loss for the tiny bit of extra armor. Never searched for a jet pack once my friend installed one on my t60. Hardly use it so I have no idea about x-01. An haven't looked into it after the change to plans either.
---
you have been blessed by Mothman presence.  
---
Rad worms increasing the positive/negative effects of mutations. I have speed demon so I assumed that’s why my thirst/hunger was moving faster. 
---
Ther is a fully assembeled Giddyup Buttercup in one of the upstairs bedrooms of the Motel/Hotel section of Whitesprings I believe it's the same one where you find Grants Saber. 
---
The room in whitesprings with the christmas trees also has a Giddyup Buttercup right in front of the shelves near the trees which also contain 2 nuka cola trucks and a toy car, borard games etc.
---
These are almost mostly always taken as toys are the best source of screws. But if you keep checking eventually you'll see them.
---
They’re just upping the grind more and more. It’s crazy, Bethesda is completely against adding content or interesting things. 
---
Their delusion makes it seem like players want more of the grind parts that obstruct gameplay. 
---
It’s like they took what they learned from arena - FO4 and threw it out the window. 
---
I don't see any beginner tips or questions posts, so I'll just ask here. Is the camp a big part of this game? I had no interest in settlements in FO4 and it seems like the camp is just my own settlement that I have to figure out where to place every time I explore more of the map. I'm only level 3 but I take it others can destroy my camp at later levels. 
---
I only played a few hours so far but it seems like this game involves a ton of survival overhead on top of the shooting and leveling up. I've already had lots of rads from having to eat and I'm not so sure where I'll get more rad away. I don't have a ton of time to play, and it's looking like best case I'll spend a lot of that time just keeping my character alive. :-/
---
thats awesome idea.  at this point it is unreasonable for people to expect NPCs in the world.  you cant just add 1 or 2 npcs, it wouldnt make sense they survived but others all died or became scorched.  bethesda would have to rework the WHOLE game to add npcs everywhere and tie them into quests.  now isolated DLCs like a vault or a different area (like far harbor) would make more sense as its isolated.  then bethesda can add npcs and tie into story there without hurting west virginia lore.
---
Since the main faction all left behind automated systems for joining, it would be interesting if a Vault opened, people poured out and joined of the dead factions, basically resurrecting them from death. This way, we would have Responders/Firebreathers, BoS, Enclave, Free States, maybe even New Raiders and restored Order of Mysteries as factions that are actually more than just memories. 
---
If Bethesda implemented something like WoW phasing or separated servers based on quest progress, it could allow for storylines and quests about restoring the former holdouts of the factions. I'd love to help Responders retake Morgantown, BoS retake Fort Defiance, Free States retake Harper's Ferry or the Order of Mysteries to wage war against New Raiders. Maybe even some non-combat quests to help gather building supplies, which would over time lead to upgraded settlements. Something like Isle of Quel'Danas in WoW, where a quest hub got upgraded over times as players progressed. Wouldn't it be nice to actively engage in rebuilding e.g. Harper's Ferry and have the satisfaction of contributing? In the end, the game motto is Rebuild America, this would fit right in! This is one of the RPG elements that I miss in the game - the impact on the world. Even if the impact would be based on collective actions (since this is MMO-lite), it would make the game feel much much better.
---
If I step even more into fantasy territory (since we are talking about Bethesda and despite loving them, I don't completely trust them with any complex system), it would be interesting if a player had to pick a single faction to join in the end. And depending on how we treat the players and NPCs of different factions, the ingame faction relations would change. More BoS players are attacking Responders? Responders would offer daily quests to hit BoS back, or to engage in diplomacy. Free States are in good standing with BoS? FS players would get quests to help rebuild Fort Defiance or assist in fight against Responders...
---
You do want some sort of limit on the generating of caps because if it was too unbalanced it would create chaos. MMO have their own economies and need a fine balance.
---
I play with my brother only so it keeps it more entertaining for me. But tbh I try &amp; help people that’s how I stay interested. If I see a low level doing something he clearly can’t I’ll inv him to a team &amp; help him with what he needs maybe go down memory lane &amp; help him do some story missions. My favorite is dragging noobs through the missile silo &amp; letting them launch (if they have a keycard of course) but this is much harder since Bethesda is ill in the head &amp; ruined TSE’s. 
---
It really doesn't need slowed down. People need ways to power through it fast if they want to. Changing your build or getting some new perk cards shouldn't be a tedious process. Have slow ways and have fast ways. Let people choose what they want to do. People will always go at their own pace.
---
Only lead and aluminum will save you space bulking
---
Here's an idea... Make a new character. It's all the same after level 50. Just lot's of grind for the next thing you want. Wait for DLC, or build a new character to play a different role than your current one. Otherwise, you'll continue to be frustrated at spending 5 days to get that next plan you don't really need.
---
The bobby pins don't bother me because I don't feel the need to stockpile 200 of them at all times, so the weight is pretty much a non-issue.  TSE doesn't bother me because the guns were meant to be *rare*, which is why they did so much damage in the first place. But even with the nerf they are still powerful damn weapons (or so I hear. I don't actually have one).  I still love the game.
---
East side of the park. 
---
I went from fully enjoying the game one day to ‘WTF am I doing playing this’ the next. 
---
It’s this formula here. The enemies should take less bullets to kill but put more damage out too. That would balance the risk/reward out rather than just make it artificially take longer to kill. 
---
Are you sure about that though?  They wouldn't just add 1 or 2 NPCs, the game already starts to wig out if there's more than one horde event going on simultaneously.  If you join an empty server and watch it fill you can see the AI start to crumble as the server gets more populated, the mobs start to stand still more often, take longer to think, fail to path, aggro slower or not at all.  If it breaks that much just from extra players spawning more enemies then you can be adding human NPCs will put an additional strain on it.  I'm not saying that human NPCs is a bad idea in theory, I'm saying they likely went with no-NPCs for technical rather than design reasons.
---
I see you put a lot of effort into the idea and I encourage to keep on doing it.
---
I just realized this too.
---
Being a long fan but now working long hours, I don’t have the time to grind hours on end. 
---
It makes it difficult to grind for gear that breaks way too fast, carry multi weapons because they just can’t take out enemies fast enough. 
---
It’s a slow process but it has been rough trying to stay motivated to play.
---
I can 1 shot lv 68 mutants with my instigating hunting rifle i play a sneak build and my sneak attack doea up to 3.50x dmg aside from critical reciever and eagle eye mutation
---
Do the Miner miracles quest for Excavator armor you need to be level 25 to wear it but it has good dmg resistance and the extra 100 carryweight is nice.
---
melee and bloodied still can, try that
---
Anything in the open can be picked up and lock picked without penalty.  In the back of the toy store there are toys strewn across the play area, not locked behind glass.  You can pick them up.  Good for a handful of screws if you are visiting the inside.
---
Good stuff
---
There’s two main terminals you have to use besides talking to the Mr. Handy’s. The first one is on the wall to the Department C side of the room and the terminal on the front desk. It’s gonna send you all over the place so not everything will be in that main room.
---
I see, shame, I'm on PC. 
---
r/bama is leaking
---
well its really cool and what's the point in killing it if you dont get anything special. 
---
Where do you start the quest?
---
I feel that. I finally put my full set of t45 on my chassis last night. FeelsGoodMan
---
Makes a difference when you get jump spawned by 6 super sprinting ghouls. ;)
---
You know.... The game allows for multiple charaters...
---
This. Hundred times this. 
---
I would also add that in similar manner - a content that you don't enjoy or don't fing engaging is still content.
---
Oh cool. I missed that part about it being in the middle of the map. When he said colorful forest I thought he meant that one area in Cranberry Bog where the trees give off some sort of pollen but I guess not since that's the Southeast corner. 
---
Yup. Glassed caverns is not what it should be. I hate walking through and seeing all the dead big bads even though I get that they were supposedly killed by the bos and by the lvl 80 scorchbeast at the end its still disappointing. I think the cave things a possibility because in fallout 1 that was a thing. But everyone needs to remember every vault in previous games had about 20 minutes worth of content. I'm hoping the far left side of the map gets interesting and they add some more nuke able areas. I feel like whitesprings and prime just are not enough. 
---
That's your problem the "few turrets". Each one is like 12-15% of your budget. 
---
Exactly. Queen is useless now she’s much harder since the bobblehead fix &amp; the huge TSE nerf &amp; 80% of the time you get the same Ultracite vent schematic so it’s truly worthless. 
---
thats what my boring melee's for :D
---
While I'm not fond of some of the "adjustments" they've made, I've still been enjoying the game.  I'm at Level 48 now, and just started on the Free States quest line.  Running around both the Bog and the Mire are very different experiences than anything up to this point in terms of the environment.  Everything before now really reminded me of normal Fallout environments, with hollowed out buildings and desolation... But the Bog and Mire are almost entirely alien in the fact that they are overwhelmingly verdant.  Especially the Mire.
---
Far back corner there is a L shaped layout of in the amusement park just east of the Dirt Track workshop (begins with a T? forget full name).  I think it's one of the inside corner portapotties that have a fully assembled buttercup shoved in the toilet.
---
One thing I don't like is when you load in water, you take rads and can get sick before you even have a chance.
---
Bye
---
Yeah, it's really complicated - you have to get something from a desk outside the building, and you have to activate only one of the two stations at a time, fighting off ghouls as you go.
---
Aside the chest piece heavy leather is just plain better than heavy combat armor. You trade ~3 DR for like 30 ER for each of the limb pieces.
---
I've seen it once. I joined and the other person promptly left. 
---
I kind of like weapon/armor durability. It brings in a new aspect of "holy shit my gun just broke and I need to find something ASAP!" You can't just find an amazing gun and just steamroll everything with it until the end of time. Sometimes it can be fun using a piece of shit weapon or armor until you can make your way back to camp and get some good shit again. 
---
What I don't like is how repairing shit costs *more* than it does to just make a new one. 
---
This started happening A LOT more after the most recent hotfix/patch for me.  I do not notice if I'm running around alone or with a partner.  But as more and more people enter the event, or area, it becomes significantly worse.
---
Friday night, somehow we ended up getting a huge crew together of 14 people I think it was... was pretty chaotic.  Ended up having the server to ourselves, and took on a few missions.  Uranium Fever took 8 minutes to complete... but I waited in that hole for 20mins for all my loot to finally load and the quest to be completed.  And I for sure was not the only one.
---
tldr: The number of people in an area DRASTICALLY increases the time it takes for loot to load and events to complete.
---
They're missing a golden opportunity to put  those enclosed, fully body medical scanners used in the scorched vaccine/nuke launching process as a way to respec your character and tie it into the game mechanics and story. It should come at a cost (1000 caps to go towards "maintenance" of the system, as well as setting a strict time limitation that ties in to the maintenance hook as well to avoid overuse/abuse. You come out with all SPECIAL points reset for redistribution. Not sure about the perk cards though, I think they should stay as is. It would be more complicated since you're awarded a pack every 5 levels with random cards. Maybe not a complete wipe but instead a way to swap unwanted duplicates from the same vendor/system?
---
how am I making the problem worse by pointing out how fake claims have made, at least, me view possibly legitimate bug/glitch claims and why it is a problem?
---
This was not QA but rather whoever does the release management. This is usually not QA but someone in Dev.  Maybe they just need a professional code release control software. 🤣
---
Not gonna lie I'm probably gonna build me a Trump wall :D
---
The map is gigantic. I don't see why they can't add in new cave systems and underground bunkers/vaults that have new challenges. Heck even adding new bosses to nukable areas would be great.
---
There have been a few threads to this same point, I will continue to report this to the Dev's. Thank you!
---
Interesting.  I hadn't had fully modded BOS Heavy combat limbs yet.  Thought the boost would be much higher.  Since my Torso was at like... 96 DR with BOS and Heavy Combat.
---
I don't think the extras are worth it for $20. Those extras are worth $5 at most.
---
what did you expect?  he isnt even a mini boss type like mirelurk queen or scorchbest?   it's rare spawn but definetly not hard to fight.  he ports around alot but he doesn't hit like a truck.
---
That's up to you. The tri gives you a cool looking uncle same head to run around with and a few other things but that's about it. Given I bought the base game and sank 160 hours in at the $60 mark and enjoyed every minute of it. 
---
The changes that have recently been implemented, are in my opinion, not in any way intended to make the game Harder, or more Challenging, but instead are designed to slow down progress, for the players who have not yet reached the End Game.
---
Slowing progress buys the developer more time to create (and hopefully test) DLCs with fewer players screaming for new content.
---
Unfortunately, the Nerfs they have implemented so far have had a major impact on a specific Character build (Stealth/Rifleman), while completely ignoring the most common overpowered build in the game (Melee).
---
Even for the Melee Build characters, who spend most of their game in Power Armor, the recent changes affecting Durability, and Fusion Cores, has introduced a significant amount of additional grind, which results in slowing their progress as well.
---
The most troubling issue with the changes being implemented, are that there are still many bugs in this game that have yet to be addressed, and many more QOL issues, that would make players much more happy, but Bethesda seems to have their priorities out of order at the moment.
---
A simple list of known issues (Bugs), and commonly requested Balance, QOL which could be voted on (Prioritized) by all players (not just those on Reddit) would certainly let them know what is important to their player base, but short of that, a little common sense would result in a priority list that looks something like this;
---
1. Server Stability
---
2. Bug &amp; Exploit fixes
---
3. Game Balance (Item Weights, Weapons, Armor, PVP system, etc..)
---
4. Quality of Life fixes, (Stash Size, Building system, etc..)
---
5. New Content Development (If the dedicated PVP servers is included in this category, it would be considered a higher priority)
---
Garahm mining HQ in the ash heap just south of middle of the three towers in the south east area 
---
Standard
---
I'm inclined to agree with you , although, Do you think you might precieve the new character as more of a challenge because you're used to your level 50+ being able to take care of himself. It's not supposed to be easy to get to level 50... If it was, the game would not be challenging. I remember my 1st character on release and it was really hard at a certian point in the main quest. You're not supposed to just be able to go where ever you want at level 20. Sometime you should have to level up a little before visiting certain areas.
---
ahh, didn't know that. dang.
---
Thanks for the tip TharoRed.   So much for no more server hopping for plans.
---
But it comes with a free Frogurt!
---
If telling a depressed person the only way to fix it is kill themselves is a joke to you, you’re the one with problems bud 
---
Growing pains is an understatement. This is more of a breech birth with twins.
---
Did you claim a workshop? If so, you opened yourself up to map-wide PvP against anyone who wanted to contest your ownership of it. No slap damage. No "return fire to initiate Pvp".  You claim a workshop and it is on.
---
Good points, all in all. I agree that the notion of the Enclave feeling more alive than the others comes from MODUS giving you orders (whereas the other dead ones make you feel like "what now?"). MODUS is actually a huge part of why the Enclave feels so Fallout-y in this game. It's an embodiment of nostalgic 50s dystopian sci-fi. 
---
PS: The uniforms are quite spiffy, even though I have to grudgingly admit that they are quite nazi-ish :/ That's why I usually go without the hat.
---
budget increases as you level ( a tiny bit)
---
With a Charisma of 4, Rank 2 of Hard Bargain and Grape Mentats, the plans cost me just under 1,500 caps at Watoga Station.
---
Do you... want it to die? I don't really see what the point of this post is.

I'm going to build a fort independence
---
Huh. That's cool. 
---
Hey Gronk, congrats on the Super Bowl win. Did Bill buy you ice cream after the game like he promised?
---
By the time you finish that quest line you'll be past lvl 25.  If you want to get a Raider set, you can look in some of the Raider PA spawns and piece together a lvl 15 set of Raider PA.  I did that before lvl 15 and was in PA from 15 onwards.
---
As you start getting towards 25, you want to head south on the map and when you hit 25 do the quest that gets you the Excavator PA.  Just make sure you have the components to craft the whole suit - black titanium is obtainable from Gorge Junkyard, probably the easiest option at those low levels.
---
I've looked at every entry on both of them, took a number, heard it called, and still the robots tell me to take a number and wait.
---
All the while, the quest has never shown in my quest log. I have no markers or anything
---
I don’t mind the grind as much so long as I can set up a nice routine. Problem is we can’t do that because of limited resources. It seems that just about every time I go to my usual ballistic fiber spots they have already been picked through. Same goes for other mats. You hit the nail on the head with the tedium. 
---
You lost all credibility with the “pay to win in the Atom Store” comment.  +15 HP for one week hardly qualifies.   
---
Hey, what are you doing in this subreddit? 
---
To be honest, while FNV story was quite good, it lacked the post-apocalyptic, nihilistic feel of other Fallouts. For me the game is more of a "cowboy adventure with Sci-Fi elements" than a Fallout. Despite many of their shortcommings, Bethesda are amazing at writing the smaller (non-main quest) stories that flesh out the world. This mosaic of stories past or present that make the world much more believable. FNV felt like an adventure (a great adventure), while Bethesda games feel like actual worlds. And in Fo76 they outdid themselves. After finishing the Order of Mysteries I felt mentally devastated. No other story ingame has done that to me. And there were many other stories which left a similar impact on me (although smaller) - the ghoul community in the sewers, the "corrected" raiders/thugs at the west end of the big tunnel, etc...
---
I asked the Dev's on this, waiting for a reply now! (Sorry for the delay I had a PTO day on friday and just now saw this.)
---
I don’t see where all this “tedious” work is coming from...

Hit Lakeside workshop first thing, set up the lead scrapper and leave it there to collect and boom you have ammo (if you need gunpowder smack some super mutants around).
---
Yes, there are times you have to specifically look for things, but hey, that’s fallout. It wouldn’t be fallout without needing to loot stuff. 
---
Even in fallout 3 and new Vegas a lot of your caps came from selling to vendors. They just added the scrapping and building in fallout 4 and it’s an awesome idea. It’s part of what makes the game so fun.
---
Even the excavator power armor took close to nothing. Hit some mole miners for the black titanium and every other ingredient is pretty basic and doesn’t require much. 
---
What do you expect from an indie game with indie devs?
---
They’re still learning.
---
Man, I’m shocked people are willing to put their names on this. 
---
Honestly anything is better than a legendary drill.
---
Standard unless you want the Uncle Sam outfit
---
i can't take credit for that, another redditor pointed it out on a thread a while back. 
---
In all previous fallout games I had multiple storage containers.
---
-A legendary weapons safe
---
-A legendary armor safe
---
-Standard weapons safe
---
-Standard armor safe
---
-Explosives safe
---
-Ammo safe
---
-Aid safe
---
These were all lined up in my stronghold so I could quickly access them and appease my hoarding/OCD tendencies. 
---
It's disappointing this can't be implemented. 
---
Yep couldn't agree more with you. Every patch has implemented something that caused the overall game/progress to be more chore like and boring. Instead of innovating and adding something useful example fixing laser weapons damage or durability I get nerfed to shit workshops. When we requested a buffed stash size we get a increase in repair costs. Till the last patch I would play daily and run queens 3 to 9 times a night if codes were available.
---
Now I'm just waiting for survival to come to see how they handle that. Thus far with recent patches I'm assuming they'll force people to re-roll and not allow equipment transfer.... Which will definitely cause me not to play because after leveling 3 character to 100+ I have no intention to doing it a 4th time. With all the data mined content regarding presidential race or vaults I'll just wait till that gets released.
---
I like messing around with my camp while waiting for someone to drop a nuke on the SBQ then I go in to help take her down. This burns up so much ammo that it triggers me to scavenge steel and lead. This leads to random fighting and finding new places and I collect other stuff in the process. This leads to making the vendor rounds to unload the excess. My favorite thing is for a low level player to find my camp and hang around long enough for me to craft the best gun I can for their level but this has only happened twice. 
---
I expected very rare encounter (I'm level 120 so yeah rare) + awesome looking alein= something anything in addition to the cool screen shot of me standing over it's corpse
---
I mostly really want to wear the cool glowing fishbowl he had on.
---
I don't expect anything good so I will not be disappointed.
---
I'd honestly rather see a penis over a swastika. 
---
My bloodied 3* super sledge, or my lvl 45 gornak axe don’t do that much damage. What is your build to do 1k with the all rise? Probably a melee build that is close to min maxed. 
---
Exactly
---
They did say mod support November 2019
---
Contracted
---
It's bugged with anti armor and furious. It resets the furious immediately and also anti armor doesn't make the explosive damage penetrate armor either. So really it's still best with TS as besides Adrenal and Nerd Rage the usual bloody buffs don't work
---
oh nvn then thank you
---
if you need "hundreds of bullets" to kill a single super mutant then you have more problems than just bad game mechanics.    hyperbole distracts from the underlying problems in the game - problems so profound that no exaggeration is necessary.
---
Luck of the draw, I've had that for 40+ lvls now and the last time I repaired my weapon was 40 lvls ago
---
You should be good to go. I completed it early and had no issues finishing the DMV quest.
---
I had to defend a workshop once from 3 mad scorchbeasts. Almost ran, as I just claimed it and had nothing built. But I did have ammo and such so I figured, why not?  It was a glorious battle, using a dead car for cover. I get the last one down to 1/4 health, and a level 15 sqeeker stumbles in.  He takes a few wild shots with a pistol and gets downed. I take more damage reviving him than I had since I took out the first one.  I knock the last one right out of the air, and smash its face in.  The kid chirps in with "at least I helped". Yes you did, someone was there to witness my glory, thanks kid.
---
To get you to play every day
---
If there are other mobs around him, he dose buff the other mobs too making them harder. 
---
I had one attack my base with a few super mutants. 
---
A purple wave left him and the super mutants glowed purple while they attacked. 
---
My favorite is radiation based weapons... nothing in this game is vulnerable to radiation lol.
---
i think you mean circumcise it by glitching
---
Nothing. I gave up. Waiting to see if it gets fixed in a reasonable time, or me just leaving it all together.
---
It's all about extending gameplay. They want you to grind and spend hours in game.
---
This isn't a game with limited perk points. The damn things practically grow on trees. Once you've settled on a build and stop spending them on random shit they just pile up. I have enough points unspent I could respec every single special just for the sake of it and still have enough left to spend on another 50+ new perks. 
---
There is one of those forests in Cranberry bog that has a series of tunnels inside.. at the end of the tunnel maze, if you take the correct path, there is a HUGE tree standing by itself.. maybe that's the one? 
---
this isnt even the op melee build lol 
---
I just love to explore the beautifully crafted world Bethesda put us dwellers in. I’m almost Level 60, explored most of the map, and I’m STILL finding so many small details and untold stories throughout Appalachia. For some odd reason I always find joy finding those little teddy bears just doing their thing.
---
...oh and I’m sill grinding up to launch a nuke at that crazed Scorchbeast Queen so I can finally get those fabled Ultracite Explosive Vents... or something. Hell I don’t care if I get it’s liver, I get something out of it at least.
---
Excuse me, but my gatling gun is *just fine*.  
---
It's everything else that's the problem!
---
Yeah i m still farming those (ps4)... after 35-40 hours i only found 1
---
That's pretty cool sadly I found him alone 
---
Great! Thanks for the answers
---
If one shotting is OP (ie what we had with TSE), then melee might see some nerfs in the future.  I specced into it this weekend, not even full spec and got back to one shotting lvl 68 super mutants.  If their intent is to remove one shot capabilities, then i imagine we'll see some lowering of the armor penetration perk at least for melee.  Probably also see some way of preventing Bloodied + adrenal reaction from stacking.
---
Not saying I want it... just saying I can see it happen.
---
You're a true artist
---
Honestly I thought the jet pack was the hardest but I managed to find that first 
---
&gt;don't hype yourself up thinking they are going to patch in a different game later. 
---
im not saying it's going to be a different game. just that the environment will change in order to add more quests and story. it is completely feasible, and like i said, with an online game like this, there is only so long that we can stand in place (story-wise). Im not necessarily hyping myself up, but logically, they don't have any other option. it's adapt or sink, and just like people shouldn't get overhyped before we have evidence of what's coming, we shouldn't automatically write off upcoming content just for cynicism's sake. Both the people still playing and Bethesda know that the upcoming roadmap will be detrimental in keeping this game alive.
---
I also disagree with the NPC prediction. if they were going to throw human NPCs in just to make people happy, they would have already done it. the game has had an uphill battle from the start, and a huge part of the backlash was the lack of human NPCs. we've seen from the robot characters and Grahm that they can have NPCs, and those NPCs can have purpose as quest givers and vendors.
---
Personally, I believe it is just to fit the narrative of the storyline, and we will see some other kinds of NPCs, be they human, ghoul or super mutant down the line. it's just really not that big of a deal to do (as we've seen), it would add some more character to the game, and it would give the feeling of progression. it wouldn't really make sense for them to keep fighting with one hand tied behind their back because they want to keep pushing the failure of a gimmick that was "every human you see is a real person."
---
now, if people are expecting impacting decisions and the option to pick your dialogue, i agree, people will be disappointed. I think the story as a whole can advance and change the map, but it will be functionally impossible for them to make it so your decisions impact the playing field (environment, characters) imo. hopefully if you're still around and playing you understand that though. while they capture a lot of the single player fallout experience, the game shares a lot of the mechanics with MMOs, and unfortunately that means dilution of depth of interactable NPCs.
---
Yes, there should be one kiddie corner to White Springs or Green Brier, just down from the monument, there is a house near the cliffs in the back ground. Be careful, there are about 20 scorched and a windago in the Bed and Breakfast, the chain saw is on the lower level on a shelf. I hope that helps abit. Best of luck, see you in the wasteland my friend. 
---
Yeah, I still get two/three cores of usage. It's not nearly enough as it should be, but at least it's somewhat usable.
---
Stock meaning not modified or upgraded.
---
I paid 25000 caps and was looking for one since beta. I had to go outside of Reddit to find a seller. Good luck man.
---
Thanks so much for the response! At the very least, it's wonderful to know that these suggestions are being read. You are appreciated
---
Honestly I thought the jet pack was the hardest but I found that first. 
---
They did not need to nerf anything explosive.
---
in Fo76, the explosive legendary damage scales with your weapon. so most of your damage output is coming from the explosions themselves, since they can hit multiple limbs. that's why two-shot (or a shotgun) were the preferred primary prefix, to double the amount of explosions per shot. now that explosive has been severely nerfed, it's only good with shotguns. a 2nd explosions ain't gonna do you any good. explosive is still probably the best secondary prefix, though.
---
with that in mind, bloodied is the equivalent to two-shot prior to the nerf. it caps at 20% health for a ~90% buff. nobody tested furious extensively but it appears to cap at 30% and you *can* miss a shot so long you don't switch targets. two-shot is just a flat 25% bonus with a huge accuracy penalty (even outside vats).
---
anti armor would be the best for non-bloodied builds but reports suggest it doesn't work with explosive. I've also read that, because of how armor works in the game, the damage is comparable to furious.
---
PvP is often what keeps an online game going. It's just this game doesn't have an engine or playerbase that wants that.  On paper it makes sense why they'd think it would be great, but nothing about what this game is supports it. 
---
If someone were to find a way to do good damage , with non legendary weapons also , should they share it online or try to keep it on the down low. It seems that it could help keep people playing more , but then it could cause another nerf.
---
Wavy Willards Water Park usually has a few good for screws. Plus a TON of trash cans so have the "Can Do" perk on for a bunch of non perishable food 
---
Two Shot is practically useless now. You outdamage Two Shot with almost anything now and Explosive doesn't push the damage on Two Shot high enough that it does numbers equal to a Bloodied build or a Furious Two Shot Explosive Auto. TSE just can't put up the numbers any more. For big single shot weapons like The Dragon Instigating Explosive is king. For automatics Bloodied, Furious or Executioners for high HP enemies is better.
---
So many things are better than TSE now. TSE was busted but the nerf was way over the top. You can't have a weapon lose a net 150%+ of it's potential damage and have it stay relevant.
---
It's not a big gun. It's crafted as one, but I'm 95% certain it's not a big gun.
---
Nice, thats a few new CAMP tricks ive learnt the last few days
---
Found 3 jetpacks while farming for CS. One time there was even 4 different mods to buy ! It’s so fucking stupid to have to literally waste so much time for something so important 
---
I feel all your complaints for sure. But for you to be lvl 3o and taking 5 hits to kill a lvl 5 mutant you are doing somethig fundamentally wrong. I'm lvl 6 know a new character now and I can kill a lvl 5 with 2 or 3 headshots. Maybe 5 to the torso and that's with base lvl 5 weapons at like 30 dmg. 
---
Not sure how it's even possible for you to struggle that bad. Are you using all lvl 1 weapons still? Sounds like you might just suck at the game as well as he other issues homie. 
---
Yup, still killable, although it takes more resources now.  But, there's zero point in killing her anymore.  A 2 star combat armor from the event, and if you're lucky you won't get a 1star drop from her... but you'd probably still vendor whatever it is anyway.
---
I haven't found any raider bases or anything, where are they?
---
it’s an issue with PA. i have ultracite PA and it appeared once i removed the PA that my carry weight got screwed up.
---
i would actually be 215/225 weight and it said i was still over-encumbered, once i was 205/225 i could sprint again.
---
definitely broken
---
Yep means it looks the same? :D
---
A gun pointed on me.
---
It takes 3 mini nukes to kill a lv 50 mr gutsy...
---
Common High level enemies have ludicrous health and projectile weapons in general are under powered considering my super sledge with no perk card boosts only takes 4 power attacks to down a mr gutsy.
---
Yeah, since vendors sell all the plans I want I now nuke locations to see what they spawn, did Morgantown last night, it was a 5/10 bit spread out, too many scorched.
---
Great write up
---
Yay, another repeat post!  
---
No problem at all! I am a bit slow today catching up on posts and comments from a three day weekend but I do appreciate the amount of care all of you put into these posts. It's awesome to see how passionate everyone is over our game!
---
I gain 17 damage on my lever with 5 ranks in demo expert.......since the nerf
---
If ammo is a concern, try the lucky hole mine, I managed to get 50+ lead in one visite. I just live in power armor for the most part because fusion cores are super easy to find.
---
I just want weapons to make sense like why the fook do explosive weapons and LMG do so little damage its not that hard to make them balanced,
---
End game weapons like the LMG, 50 cal, Auto Grenade launcher and Mini Nukes should be Scorchkillers
---
And mid game weapons like the Minigun and Rocket Launcher should also be decent and not a waste of space
---
I mean rare items should equal decently strong items
---
Before hotfix, after the last "big" patch.
---
I played the Anthem demo all weekend and after 9pm when it ended I tried to play FO76 just to tie up a few loose ends... I couldn't even play... I had to quit to main 6 times before I got a server that allowed me to even move or bring up my pipboy... even then I think I made it about 60 yards and did a jump into rocket boost and the game froze midair... I had to once again, quit to main menu but this time I just logged off and was too annoyed by the fact that all that zero game play time took 30+ mins!
---
And wtf is with Bethesda saying hey, if you group up you can get a bonus to your HP Pool but ONLY if you buy on of these Atom store items that cost 700 atoms...
---
This game seems to o ly be getting worse and it makes me sad...
---
I love you! Thanks for this! I've been looking for a through break down. Gonna to take your word. Glad I didn't transfer to AAE!
---
I enjoy killing super mutants because they actually talk or yell at you when fighting. I like it when I'm sneaking around and one says something like 'I wish another buchethead would show up' or they talk about the 'green goo'. And of course running into Grahm. Sometimes he talks about 'stinkers' which is hilarious. I also like running into the prize bot at inopportune times. Nothing like fighting something and all of a sudden you hear 'CONGRATULATIONS'. I also love/hate exploring an area and hearing that damned flapping sound and trying to hide from the Scorchbeast. A few times I've been able to run away and it follows and ends up attacking another mob. The other day it started attacking a mirelurk queen.
---
I'm pretty sure the industrial water purifiers only hold up to 5 waters at a time. So if you aren't at them when they're producing it won't stack.
---
I made a second file focused on melee since that seems to be the only way to kill enemies with out being tedious now.
---
Today?!
---
Same exact thing happened to me. It didn’t work for me when I was playing with friends even though it worked for them. I hopped to another server and did it independently and it worked fine. Could that be your issue? 
---
Cool. Let us know if you have any luck!
---
You're supposed to get the serum plans from SBQ... for free. Or you can buy them from another player for around 7-10k caps.
---
Or... And this part may be too crazy... You can just not learn the serum plan.
---
Any item that you pay for that gives you an advantage is pay to win... it doesnt matter how insignificant it is. Anything other than cosmetics to in-game assets is pay to win.
---
What crafting perk are you talking about?  Unless your building energy or explosive you really only need 5.  Late game you will not be building your gear, only upgrading legendarys and repair. 
---
Most builds i don't do 9 points, but if your building sneak rifles, you want to kill them fast before you break sneak.
---
Just remember tank killer is 100% needed in any rifle build.
---
There's various guides out there, I found a full set by server hopping The Crosshair myself.  Others have done Clarksburg.  Here's some of those with PA spawn locations...

---
In the first big patch they nerfed the hell out of all resource generators, to point of obsolescence, while water purifiers are at least still sonewhat useful they can only hold 2-3 bottles at a time which is kinda annoying if you want to stock up or make enough to give/sell to other players.
---
They are not quite as bad as the Workshop resources, like the steel mill that produces something like 30 steel an hour...
---
So yeah, not a bug, just very poor game design intended to make the game more grindy, survival mechanics means more grind right?
---
Considering Fortnite is cross platform between PC, XB1, PS4 and Switch, I would say yes, it is very possible.
---
No he boughted me ol’TeSsE but now she cunt 1 shut em no mo!!!
---
i only heard that it bugs out with herbivore, just carnivore has been fine for me and i’ve had it for a long time
---
I've seen him once when i was level 3 and had no CAPS, this was in Flatwoods near the gas station. :( Didn't think much of it at the time thinking I would see him again. 
---
Yes you do. If a player kills you even if you didnt accept the challenge, you loose caps. At my lvl i was loosing 140 caps per kill. And yes i have pacifist on, but guess what happens when 2 people with 1k melee damage do when they corner you and beat you to a pulp. You die, you still loose caps. And guess what, the most caps they will EVER GET is 20 cap bounty fpr cold blooded murder. And of course even if your in pacifist it doesnt stop them from literally blowing your base up. Ive had to use all of my extra junk repairing my base several times.
---
I stood there and let them hit me repeatedly, and at no point with in 2 health bars did they get a bounty for repeatedly hitting me only when they killed me and only one got a bounty for it.
---
Aww, sorry to hear that buddy...
---
But on a real note, every time they pan the camera over at Gronk it looks like he has absolutely no fucking idea where he is.
---
Bethesda just needs to pick a base to cater to, either PVE or PVP. Cause right now, trying to satisfy both groups is resulting in a very shitty game. 
---
I play this game like I played both Fallout 4. "Main quest? What's that? I'm gonna 'splore" honestly the whole No NPC's thing doesn't bother me at all because all I do is 'splore and shoot shit that is hostile. Best part of No NPC's is not hearing the bitchy ones talk shit just by you walking by them ( looking at you Breith)
---
I've jumped out of game and back in a few times. Didn't change anything. Not sure how to actually switch server on ps4. It might be sending me back to the same one
---
Its definitely related to VATS. I can sprint through my AP bar, but if I vats through it there's big ol chunks. Easily 1-2% of my core per strike.
---
Bulking is for things you cant sell individually mostly, it doesnt save space at all in most cases it increases the weight, the weight being lost is from the plastic it takes to bulk
---
Melee does not need to be nerfed.
---
Players like me go out of our way to provide ammo, weapons, armor, and supplies to new players. I would often times repair and modify legendaries and freely distribute to others I met. Not to mention act as a sherpa for quests and events. So yea, players like myself who leave does detract from the “you are the NPCs” of this game.
---
Do you have enough power for all those purifiers?  The max the smaller ones hold is 2 at a time.  I've always done industrial myself with a water source, since those are the only ones that can hold more (5 at a time).
---
If you're using mini nukes to kill a single gutsy you have more problems than ammo consumption.
---
Gutsys are armored and radiation immune and explosive weapons in this game are for now focused on their ability to deal aoe damage rather than spike damage. 
---
I did that, and it seemed to work. The odd thing is, any time I add armour onto a frame, it always doubled in the transfer window, but if I close it and go back in, its back to only one piece.
---
Maybe a higher level was mining in there and dropped stuff they didn't want into containers because even with Excavator they were overencumbered? Seem unlikely, though.
---
I've dabbled in other games here and there and play f76 mostly on weekends for a bit.  I am playing with a 3rd character and running around areas I havent done before.  Finding lots of fun, helping new players figure stuff out.  
---
I don't know why people think its a bad thing to take a break or run out of stuff to do after the months of playing the game.  Why do we need to be married to ONE game forever?  Why do the developers need to provide content to us at a rate that allows this to happen?  
---
It's not realistic.
---
Not true.
---
Dupers can be crafty with how they store their dupes. The amount of players with 5 piece sets of Sentinel/cavalier combat armor will stick out. So you find those 100 accounts first and then start looking for patterns. 
---
If your stash box is full of what should be extremely rare weapons and armor you should be concerned.
---
the main missions of the fallout, were not so incredible, the secondary ones were interesting in fallout 4, here I hate having to talk to robots / computers or a voice that supposed I did something 
---
Wow! This explains a lot!
---
Well your mining the ore wrong, you use a shot gun and kill mole miners and you will have more then you know what to do with. 
---
I believe there's on upstairs in the bedroom area of Bolton Greens.
---
I used mods to do that in FO4 and Skyrim. Fights are brief but brutal. SO much more fun. Instead of it feeling like you're having a Nerf fight, you really want cover, and the opening shot.
---
sadly only 5 tho
---
I think it is about perspective. I’m a Level 44 who got into video games in general and the Fallout franchise specifically to avoid social interaction.  My nights, like real life, involve roaming the map looking for screws then rushing home to see what fires or bored level 107 guy has destroyed everything.  I have accepted this and think it beats watching Family Guy reruns.  I’m saving up for brick walls and pretty sure that I just need a hardened receiver for my combat shotgun to actually take on a scorched beast and live.  Sometimes, as I watch my character in bed sleeping, I ponder life and all of its absurdities. Like how did my character figure out how to separate the cloth from the adhesive in duct tape?  Or if I spent this much time working on a side hustle could I afford to remodel my bathroom?
---
Holy crap I was about to type the same thing.  I find 90% of modern games to be tedious, the devs don't understand the difference between hard and tedious.
---
Cool, bro.
---
FO76 is garbage
---
Post a screenshot of the man location or a video. Your either a liar or confused about where the first is and trying to build your house right next to a fissure. No one cares that your leaving by the way. Peace out
---
Camps and workshops are different, you also lose the workshop everytime you log out
---
Now I aint sure which of them desribes going out of your way but to your target and which one describes a medical procedure that would take this penis-oriented discussion from architeture to sociology, politics and medicine. Lets remain at dickshaped cottages plz.
---
Do they have any plans to make server hopping rng venders not a thing?
---
For heavy weapons, just go power armor. Stabilized is a keystone ability. Also, IMO you don’t get much benefit from going Unyielding, since you don’t really use VATS. At least, I haven’t seen a HW vats guild yet. 
---
I've been running around half naked because I don't care anymore about armor. Now I enjoy life in game at least bit more. It is like a burden fell off. If I die, I respawn and do it again.
---
This game was designed around power armor and melee combat, quite clearly. 
---
maybe people want new content, because there is not much currently  I have taken a break since January, waiting for new content  I'm still enjoying monster hunter for now 
---
He ruined fallout tho
---
It’s so annoying... I kept some cool weapons to give to friends but then they found the same ones so I was going to sell them but I have to wait 20 hours to sell more??? I need more space in my stash before I can play anymore because I’m super over-encumbered... If we can’t sell everything at least let us dismantle the “special” weapons with stars for parts or something...
---
So I’m literally not playing because of this.
---
I've left and rejoined 3 times now and still get the message :/
---
One shot kill seems like a bad thing to aim for when balancing in this game.
---
I've tried 3 times and get the same message :/
---
They did it for all other PA i guess they forgot about the x-01 so i guess it should be fixed at some point
---
I know a player who was recently Banned, after finding and picking up a huge amount of obviously duped items, the player contacted Bethesda Support before anything else happened, and after a short amount of dialog, including sharing of video clips, he was banned, and unable to get any response since.
---
I personally have several New Characters I've been developing as Vendor Characters, which Bethesda has stated they would provide some specific support for, but so far all they have done is lock them down and make them completely unusable with the new weight limit.
---
Between the Banning (of innocent players), the new weight restriction, and the recent weapons Nerfs, several of my regular team has quit playing, leaving me to play alone most of the time, and think, I could just go back to FO4, and avoid the damn griefers. 
---
Oh I agree with that and I sure think there should be a limit on how slow it gets.  But even at a more slowed pace there are still ways to XP farm and level up quickly.  It's just not as crazy fast as it used to be.  I think another way to make a slower leveling system feel a bit more rewarding is to just actually make the game more rewarding.  I think people (myself included) feel that leveling is important just because you get a tangible reward that is guaranteed every time.  But honestly after a certain point those perk cards or point swaps just don't really mean anything.  But the way the game is designed perk cards are still the most dependable reward for playing the game.  Make the game more rewarding overall and the stockpiling the meaningless perk cards stop mattering.
---
If this is all we get, then that's going to be the nail in coffin for me. March has some great titles coming out. 
---
Hey, unless you run starched genes 24/7, sometimes you mutate in ways you don’t want, just asking :) I’m having to redo my sniper’s mutations because I picked up empath unexpectedly... it’s a pain in the ass
---
Before I quit playing and posting that I quit playing. Because I was feed up with the Incompetence of Bethesda Austin.
---
I did play for 2 and a Half hours testing stuff.
---
I found Bloodied Weapons with Unyielding Armor the best.
---
Anti Armor Explosive shotguns like pump and Combat to be very good.
---
I found Two Shot not worth running honesty.
---
Got my jet pack for 2 k figure beats server hoping 
---
Happens sometimes.
---
Right? I think Sofie's body is on the back porch of one of the houses in Flatwoods, with her survivor story.  
---
Or was Sofie the addict next to the river? I don't recall. 
---
Furious 30% max from what I've read is applied to final damage and not base weapon damage.  It should be much better than 30% to base weapon damage, because it gets applied post all the DR/armor calculations.
---
I'm lvl 50 and the only weapons I carry are a serrated combat knife for up close and personal stuff, a combat shotty when things get really crazy, and my trusty, suppressed revolver pipe rifle.
---
You're level 30? Get yourself a level 30 revolver pipe pistol and attach a rifle stock to it. Be sure to keep all the 45 ammo you can find and make.  
---
Now, max out all three gunslinger cards and all three rifleman cards. A revolver pipe rifle uses both handgun and rifle perks! Also get the plumber perk to keep it from breaking easily.
---
Just make sure you don't one shot any legendaries before they get a chance to pot shot it.
---
sentinel/cavalier armor
---
Man I feel ya.  The game has become more grindy, but there's a way out.  Well kinda.  It'll be less grindy at least.
---
Let me preface this by saying I'm not an expert by any means, so someone correct me if I'm wrong.  I have played a lot and been stuck in a similar situation.  Here's some things that might help with your issues:
---
1.  I don't ever have an issue with broken weapons (might just be stupidly lucky though).  I have a lvl 5 Gunsmith (INT) equipped and a lvl 3 Luck of the Draw (LUK) equipped at all times.  Maybe try those?  It seems to work miracles as I can play 6 - 8 hours and only be at half condition. I have a TSE Double Barrel Shotgun for reference.
---
2.  Armor deterioration, go get some power armor and keep it on your person.  I suggest Excavator PA located at the Garahan Mining HQ as it adds an extra 100 lbs carry weight. When your armor breaks, use it to get to safety or to go gather mats for your armor.  A full chassis weights 10 lbs. That is a lot, yes, but it'll last a lot longer it seems.  You can get the lvl 3 Fix it Good (INT) and repair to 200% condition for Power armor AND regular armor.  Now I don't use armor, but I'm assuming it works close to the same as guns.  Maybe try to have lvl 3 Armorer (INT) and lvl 3 Lucky Break (LUK) equipped at all times?  It's almost the armor equivalent of my guns setup.  I repaired my excavator PA with lvl 3 Power Smith (INT) and lvl 3 Fix it Good (INT) equipped and it still has gotten below 100% condition after days of playing (4-5 hours a day).
---
3.  Ballistic Fiber is a pain.  Spend some time jumping to military installations (Camp McClintock, Camp Venture, any BoS base in the Cranberry Bog) and pick up Military Duct tape and Military Ammo Bags.
---
4.  Caps.  Go exploring and instead of breaking all your guns, sell them at vendors.  Set up your CAMP at a location between a few vendors so fast travel is cheap.  Try to store everything you don't need, jump in the Excavator PA, go explore some place that's relatively low level, kill everything with a melee weapon to save bullets, and sell everything as is.  Don't scrap (unless you know what you can sell and can't sell at a vendor) as you'll have to bulk some scrap to sell it.  If you can place your camp close to 3 or 4 vendors, you'll be able to make a good 600 to 800 caps a day  without too much effort.  Personally, I bulk everything that can bulk over 150 of a scarp item.  Like I have 200 gears, I bulk 50.  When I log in after work, I jump to all the vendors and sell the scrap I got the day before.  Also sell all my food.  It'll spoil before I use it.  Glowing Meat Steaks sell for 10 caps.  You can easily get those at higher lvls.
---
5.  I don't have any good advice that's not campy or grindy for Fusion Cores.  Sit down and defend a power plant or go take power armor in the world.  Take the whole thing and scrap it please.  No one likes getting excited just to walk up to an empty chassis.
---
6.  Work on your build.  There are several websites that will let you plan your build.  Take some time to read all the perk cards and pick a specific type of weapon or 2 and stick with those.  I went all explosives and shotguns, but the build also lets me swap out perks to get a decent melee build as well.  Also research this sub for other builds that might work for you.
---
I hope that helps.  It's worked for me.  I'm rarely ever hurting for anything except plastic for bulking.  I keep scrapping all and scrapping my bulk with the new bug.  BTW, store your bulk in your stash ASAP!
---
I'm sure this is a user error. Got some karma though and Pat's on the back from your hater friends,  feeling pretty good aren't you? Hey, I did the millennial thing! gonna unsubscribe now that the world is your oyster? 
---
Lol true
---
I think I've seen it at the BoS Vendor in Watoga ("Table Television") - I'm not sure if that was before or after Patch 5 though.
---
It *always* was possible to kill the SBQ. We did it last night on the PS4, and I went through approximately 200 rounds on my gatling gun, she was dead in 5 minutes, flat.  
---
2SEs became a crutch. Sure, they need to make her drops better, no argument here, but she's killable just fine.
---
I decided to give it a few days of play before I drew any conclusions. I first needed to change my template around by leveling up a few times (since your drastic changes didn't include a free respec, as is customary by most companies that care about the players in situations like this).
---
I'm not a PVPer. I won't bother addressing that since the nerfs to TSE could have been tailored to PVP damage. 
---
Prior to the patch, I didn't use all the perk cards that enhanced weapon damage. So I had to change that and use all of them to try to get close to where I was before. Obviously I'm still not nearly as effective and my template is a one-hit-wonder because I have to devote my points to strength or perception to maximize the weapon damage: so shotguns and heavy, rifles/SMGs, or pistols.
---
I'm not a melee guy. I almost quit playing early on because the game seemed to be melee or bust. Then I farmed my first TSE and the game experience completely changed. I no longer had to constantly farm for ammo and repair. But you not only wrecked TSE but also made repairs more painful so it was a double hit.
---
Prior to the patch, I felt TSE was very strong but, compared to melee, it wasn't as OP as people seemed to complain. And it wasn't just melee people that complained so I'm not throwing rocks here. There was definitely a consensus that something needed to be tweaked when you compared TSE to other weapons. The philosophy that is never followed is to enhance other weapons rather than nerf the current ones. 
---
When you decided to nerf TSE this much, you should have enhanced ranged weapons at the same time. I shouldn't have suddenly felt like I was a new character with pipe weapons. And TSE were endgame weapons so they should have still felt more powerful compared to anything else I spent hours trying to find.
---
So where are we now? I can make it work. I can work around the nerf. But I realized I don't want to. It takes twice as long to do anything as it did before. You should have added explosive resists to boss mobs and enhanced all ranged weapons and left TSE largely alone. The best part of TSE was being able to grind through ordinary mobs when farming to save time and focus on more fun parts of the game. Now I can't even put points into charisma to make grouping viable. I don't have the points.
---
Two suggestions:
---
Easy to do: enhance ranged weapons and restore some of the TSE damage. Increase explosive resist to boss mobs. 
---
Hard to do: rethink the card design. Consider two sections: combat and quality of life, with separate point pools. Also add character templates so you can more easily swap cards around.
---
I went from being ambivalent about the game and its eternal grind to enjoying the game once I found a way to do things economically as a ranged player. And now the game is tedious and not worth playing for me.
---
I will keep an eye on patch notes and will try this again in about six months. The reality is that you don't care how many quit right now: you are worried about future players who come in and start with a very different game experience. I hope you succeed. It just likely will not be with me playing.
---
Yes I've experience the damage glitch again.
---
BuT thE NpCs AreNT huMan sHAPeD. 
---
I only read text from human shapes NPC’s. This is the only way to enjoy it. 
---
didn't realise tank killer was so important. ill have to look at doing some respecing. 
---
here are the crafting cards I'd use. I think if I included Science then INT would need to be 9 not 8 as it takes 3 science perk cards (6 points) for energy weapons +weapon artisan 
---

---
Holy shit that is dark 
---
Destiny 2 would make sense if one didn't have to pay 4 times the initial cost of the game in order to get all the DLC and play it.
---
So serums have worked fine for you with carnivore active?
---
Yep, even if your foundation is sticking 6 feet in the air, you can get on top by just walking into it.. no jump needed. I dont know if the stacking breaks that though
---
I only wonder how crappy some of you are as real people... Oh wait, what did I expect.
---
Serems are like the most end-game items though. Also those are the PLANS. You can buy a serem for like 3500 for yourself. 
---
Sometimes there's just a visual bug as well. Make sure you press the button to go into the purifier's inventory and transfer. Sometimes they don't pop up until you do. Especially with the Industrial Purifier.
---
This game has an awesome community. That's what I really like about it, no matter how much bad mouthing youtubers give it or if they make a mistake in updates the community rally's together for the most part.
---
found 3 of them, only once did other mobs happen to be around. 
---
Mods should be available like plans this is bs I tried for 10 hrs straight nothing other then load outside service entrance loot the garbage truck , the mini nuke , then check modus to realize he has the fucking light and the over drive servos I died twice of hunger and I just gave up.
---
The problem is the way damage reduction works. Fast low damage weapons do almost nothing
---
Time to build my ~~tomb~~ pyramid
---
I support it!
---
I use explosive weapons and the rad worms and armor/weapon durability nerfs piss me off way more.  Stability I can be patient with.
---
Overrepair it and the dmg goes from shit to ooo nice, this thing really lvl 20?
---
And if you're lucky you might find a plan for a mole miner gauntlet /s
---
Unsure how 15% on five gear pieces, totalling 75% damage reduction, makes you take 0 damage from sneak attacks of a weapon dealing 350ish damage. Somehow seems unlikely.
---
I’m stuck using excavator P.A, strong back lvl 4, thru hiker 3, travelling Pharmacy 3, lighter ammo perk etc and stuffing my face with carry weight boosting food items like radstag ribeye and cramburgers (if I stumble upon mirelurk eggs) because I refuse to dump my prized possessions lol, I’m a hoarder and can’t help it (also not about to reform any time soon) and the problem just gets worse cause when fusion cores started to drain faster I started panic hoarding fusion cores so I’ve had to turn to batteries not included perk to lug my 30 fusion cores around lol. Also if your storing 10 of each stable flux for the day when you finally get your hands on xo1 plans or the elusive shielded underarmour plans then it soon adds up and I know if I sell my flux that will be the day the RNG blesses me with Brotherhood shielded lining plans for that forbidden knowledge quest instead of just bomber jackets and ammo lol
---
My hopes (other than them actually releasing more content) are the vaults are just part of the expansions/dlc/added.  
---
For example:  
---
Crumb leads you to the church in the mire.  
---
This leads you to a few quests to gather info  into how to open Vault 94  
---
Vault 94 is a 30-45 minute dungeon run, leads you to another Quest line  
---
Search/Gather/Retrieve quests (Possibly involving Responder knowledge to free Vault 94 peeps from something)  
---
Information learned leads you to locked door in Tanagra town  
---
This ends up being a longer dungeon where you find the "True Heart" (or some bs) of the stranglers  
---
New boss unlocked - After you complete the quest line, you can nuke Tanagra to unleash that boss. Personally I would love it to be a giant Hermit Crab with the tree on it's back but meh.  
---
Then the DLC has a new feature (Factions will probably be the first one), new items in the loot table, new perk cards.  
---
New Rebuilt Area
---
Think it's the damage glitch though? I have never had an issue with the damage glitch aside from using explosive weapons, in earlier builds of the game. Not a single issue with any kind of damage output since the update either. It seems to be him not taking any damage whatsoever.
---
I dont disagree, but I will say this— Paying $60 for FO76, or even more for the Tricentennial to get what we have today is just as bad. At Bungie rolled out incremental patches and had stable servers— clearly the money I paid for 76 hasnt improved the quality of the game in terms of stability/patching.
---
You tell one hell of a tale there.
---
Git gudder and get a Super Sledge.
---
Don't forget his soothing voice
---
I have 3 large purifiers at my camp and most of the time when I get back to it they each have 5 purified water as expected
---
Nuke them 
---
Sure. But this is a game. There's no story in the game. There's a story in a book in the game. But personally i usually x through that garbage and what I know fallout for is memorable characters. We need a Nick Valentine. We need a decision to nuke the first town or not. We need to be able to shoot people in the face who may or may not be essential to the main storyline.
---
I was playing this morning(PS4) inside the drop zone of a nuke. Trying to get the achievement. The nuke hit and my PS4 crashed.  Not the server.  The server didn't disconnect.  My PS4 crashed. 
---
I was like wtf
---
yep i’ve gotten at least 5 new mutations via serums after carnivore and i’ve had 0 problems
---
Kingdom hearts 3 and destiny 2 await. I heard they have NPC boyfriend's and girlfriends waiting at the door for the hero. You can being all your clickbait hate train friends... Errr " players" with you. This game couldn't meet your needs but the perfect one is just on the horizon. Time to make that next big step and unsubscribe and delete this game from your life since you came handle it. Teach everyone a lesson and show them your independent and not afraid of choices. 
---
No! I have such a great collection of nail boards
---
I had heard that the Anti-Armor/Explosive combo was bugged but didn't know if it was accurate. So at this point TSE is still the best unless you're running a min/max build then bloodied/explosive would be best, correct?
---
I genuinely think their efforts are born not out of intelligent gameplay tweaks, but out of a desire to slow progress down because they realize future content is a long ways off.
---
Well, if that silo has like challenge for team and has actual reward that requires me to actually participant in this challenge, then I would be pretty fine with it for a while. Depending how hard they make it.
---
I think that is actually not just fine, but really good, because as far it is gone, we have seen recycled content that has been labeled into "New fun content". Events, do you see it? yea absolute meaningless garbage. Upcoming new PVP mode, absolute garbage (Not that I am against PVP, just their implementation sucks). So, if they don't pull the plug on the game, I don't think we see any new extension wise of map content.
---
What drives our character when they exit the vault? Every previous fallout character had a strong motivation.
---
Hmm, might be a good idea to try then, I just don't wanna waste the 3.5k caps ;_;
---
It doesn’t matter anyway, firing it takes away all your ammo anyway
---
Especially when you get shot while reading
---
I don’t have the time in that most of you have (level 30), so consider that before reading further. I’m still enjoying myself and trying to stay optimistic. However!
---
One thing I can’t tolerate is getting fucked over by things beyond my control. Examples:
---
- spawning into an area by way of fast travel or load screen door, there are no visible enemies, yet I’m getting throttled. Then suddenly they all render as I’m about to die.
---
- weapon switch not acknowledging during combat when I really fucking need it
---
- stimpak hot key not acknowledging when I really fucking need it
---
- enemies right in front of my face, and right in my sights, not taking damage because latency 
---
- disappearing inventory. As of last patch I’ve lost multiple stacks of junk that I wanted to sell to vendors, but it disappeared en route.
---
Here are some things I’ve noticed that just basically suck:
---
- previous titles used to reward the player with decent loot for fighting through a building and lock-picking a high level door or safe at the end. You can count on FO76 to give you purified water, .38 ammo, and prewar money for your troubles.
---
- I’m preaching to the choir, but I finally hit stash max, and i truly cannot think of what I should get rid of. I have 3 weapons, one set of power armor with chassis, no aid, the rest is ammo, junk, and misc. all my bulkable stuff is bundled and capped at 5 stacks each. 
---
Other perks/mutations added in probably increasing the DR....then with the wonderful Rad Worms glitch, there’s no telling what his percent off was at.
---
a proper setup reduces around 91.5% damage *before* hitting DR.
---
you could be dealing 1k and still wouldn't see their health bar move.
---
Didn't get anything worthwhile as it goes. A few bits of leather armour mainly
---
Here's my Whitespring Vendor Co. bulding. I set it up right next to the station. It has every crafting station, open water purifiers for passerby's, and a great view. It has gone through some changes after these pics were taken, and could use some extra polish. I have a ton of stuff unlocked that could make it a lot better. Next will be a decontamination shower at the entrance. 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/7mbdpWm](https://imgur.com/a/7mbdpWm)
---
You mean biodegradable like the stuff you use for Septic tanks right?
---
Should be cool loot for this. Maybe reward players for actually exploring Appalachia instead of the massive rewards being earned by standing in front of a loot cave for 300+ hours.
---
Not today, but when I was 30ish, I came out, stood on top of the bunker and I never stopped firing.  I might not have done a lot of damage, but I wasn't going to be a leach.  It comes down to society these days, you don't have to work for anything.  Just wait for your xp handout.
---
I loved the karma systems we've had in the past. I think this is an awesome idea! 
---
Yes
---
The stores are already giving them away as bonus for buying other items. 
---
Can you link the threads which have stated the same point so I can refer to them for the answers? Thank you.
---
I actually really like this suggestion. 
---
"this is not Skyrim" The shouting dragon-scorchbeasts would have a word with you
---
Explosive causes a reset on Furious I hear. TSE is still the best even if you run a bloody explosive. Not enough of the bloody build transfers over to melee
---
As I outlined in the edit, this guy's healthbar went from 100% to 1 health on the first shot, then he turned immortal, so that's really not it. Didn't wanna post the video, but [here you go anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52eZe4HuxTU). What's happening there and what you're describing are two entirely different things.
---
and in regards to you edit, that's just how the server deals with the setup. on your side it's gonna look like their health is jumping around like crazy.
---
It seems to be tied to server lag.  I have it happen to me all the time when trying to loot the SBQ.  Sometimes I have to wait around for a couple minutes and after most people leave, I can collect my explosive vent, scorchbeast heart, wing and a stock lvl 45 LMG.
---
imo they’re not worth 3,5k, you can get them for 400 each online. just ask around the market subs and someone’ll hook you up with any serums you want for 700 or less
---
&gt; So really it's still best with TS
---
Maybe out of the ones the OP was asking about (and minus shotguns, where the twoshot buff wasn't much to begin with, and now it's nothing: one more pellet with 25% damage), but my 2 cents is that a combination of explosive Instigating and Executioner's would be ideal (meaning, a set of two weapons). Either one has a higher damage buff than a TS, but obviously you need controlled fighting conditions to make good use of the combo (not good if you get swarmed by enemies).
---
I found an explosive Harpoon gun yesterday, and it's fun to use after modding to employ flechettes, and the ammo glitch is still not fixed on that one. It's Nocturnal, though, so it's my new nightshift tool for clearing Watoga. ;-)
---
No problem with that. At least you had a go
---
That happened to me last night, made the mistake of popping into WS for a little bit after a very long resource hunt, without thinking of my overloaded inventory. Accidently tagged a bot with my pipe rifle (best thing I have) but was sneaking, so they didnt realize. went inside to finally scap everything and bam, assaultron killed me. tried 3 times to get my loot back, died each time, then someone took the whole damn thing. Lost hours of foraging. Even tried explaining to all the players in local voice in the crafting shop what happened, everyone ignored me. Lesson Learned lol
---
!Remindme 1 year 
---
I agree 100%. Currently at level 36 with level 30 weapons and armor, no legendaries yet, unfortunately. I tackled a level 50 scorched beast the other day. Mostly cost me in stimpaks, but since then I've been able to stay afloat with 20 stimpaks or so at a time. I haven't been having a hard time with enemies either and I'm working on a rifleman build using purely ballistic weaponry. It's useful to look around Reddit for material farming locations. Need screws or springs? Go to Sugar Grove, slaughter the protectron bots, loot, loot, loot and loot. Always remember to tag materials so make it easier on yourself in your travels.

But then me have to move round too much, me lazy no skill

Bethesda has never bothered with game balance in their RPGs, it just hasn't been a concern for them, which was tolerable in a single player exploration or story driven experience.  It was never a GOOD thing, as it has meant combat in their unmodded games is a joke, but it didn't ruin the experience.
---
Unfortunately, they took a lot of their bad habits and lazy design and assumed the same thing would fly in a multiplayer looter-shooter.
---
It's not just that they're bad at balance, it's that they didn't even think it mattered.
---
That or they buff things back to an unretarded state (obviously and rightfully weaker than before)
---
just replied to your edit. that's also normal for sentinel/cavalier.
---
Great, so we can suffer across multiple alts...
---
That is great if you played when the mobs gave great xp and leveled to the 200. Great but they nerf'd a lot of that and the weapons have been nerf'd and the perks. It is now an overwhelming slower leveling experience nowadays. 
---
I used to level once or twice a day. Now I level maybe once every 3 or 4 days. Leveling is a lot harder that it once was so respecing 1 pt per level is a painful experience for people that don't have a ton of perk pts banked.
---
Can confirm bos combat allows camo paint.
---
Amen, I'm tired of my gaming sessions going "tonight I'm going to quest!!!... Wait...no... I'm going to go farm screws! And ballistic fiber for my armor that'll break in no time against these super mutants that will eat all my ammo!". I love this game but, I've put it down because I'm just tired of having to pre-farm just to be able to go quest. I'm sorry I'm in my mid 30s now Bethesda with a family and I don't have 2 hours to get mats just to go have fun for 1 hour...
---
Are you kidding? The responders missions are voluntary but you have to go into the woods to continue them from the airport. The fire breathers were extremely heroic and after passing through brim quarry and reading the action report from the LT and the fire breathers prayer standing in front of the flames in belching Betty gave me chills. I don't even wanna join them but I thought the whole thing was poetic as far as a group goes. They head a vibe. The raiders sounds like my kind of party. A whole bunch of disenfranchised paranoid people on a ski resort who decide to just take what they want cause it's a survival of the fittest. I like all the ranting holotapes and the "cut off your nose to spite your face blowing up of the dam" plenty of factions had good stages set. I think in survival we will get to learn more about each and make them now immersive
---
When you launch a nuke from the silo an icon appears in the middle of the red zone (showing ground zero) if you die within that circle you get a rare achievement, it’s also where the most enemies spawn.

Can I ask why Int for melee?
---
Powered "Gates" is really power doors.  It's the bottom 4 options in WALLS.

---
it is the servers..it can be noticed very easily at a queen...cause the Spinning will spin and spin and spin and youll get the quest complete updates like 5 minutes after the queen dies..and youll finally be able to start looting
---
Agree with all points, though for the last part - If you have lots of ammo I would suggest running Bandolier 2 and Batteries Scrapped 3. You are at Lv30 so by Level 35 its possible to max out these cards. Your ammo will weigh next to nothing (except Missle and Mini Nukes), and it's way more efficient to have on your person than in the stash. Bulk only aluminum and lead to save space, break down or sell everything else as this eats up storage.
---
The brown Fisherman's Overalls comes to mind. 
---
Sold by Cunningham at Whitspring.
---
Guessing this will get patched soon right? No point in building it as your house will probably disappear 
---
&gt;So serums have worked fine for you with carnivore active?
---
Carnivore was my first mutation, and serums have always worked for me, so that's a Yes from me. Out of superstition, I also switch out Starched Genes whenever I use a serum, but I think that's not  a necessity, either.
---
A fair point, but of course a silly choice as their is another way to keep people playing beyond grinding and that's actually making players investment worth it, maybe fixing a while group ofnweapoms (heavy and energy) might help or nerfing things that need it, like bobble head stacking, and the melee master race haha
---
Unless you're doing some crazy unique shit like mass crafting weapons for mods YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GRIND FOR SHIT.
---
I seriously do not know what game you people are playing. Just fucking around farming legendary gear and picking up the occasional junk I have so many resources I occasionally just drop loads of it.
---
As far as the thirst and fusion core thing goes it's a fucking bug. 
---
Gee, you can't go around recommending White Knight and Gunsmith to people! Remember, BGS /didn't/ want those to be mandatory picks!
---
This literally made me quit for the day I did 2 queens and both kept loading then disappeared. This has happened to me only with this patch.
---
It has been happening lately, yes--especially if it's your first load in of the session. Give it a good minute or two, or if you logged in near your camp, you should be good to go once it loads in completely
---
The addict by the river is literally named as Chem Addict, so I don’t think it would be her. Not sure about the lady on the porch as I cannot remember 😬

PlayStation 4
---
Encountered infinite load screen when entering Fort Defiance. Screen is stuck at the black with gray squares stage, Loading shows the three dots cycling, 76 gear icon spinning, and the music is the ominous battle drums. Been sitting here for ten minutes and counting.
---
I wound up with combat armor leg in my inventory that has atom shop camo paint.  No idea how it got there and I don't have the plan.  Maybe I picked it up out of a bag.
---
A few sites have this for about £8 or $10, so shop around....
---
Bingo. The mouse over won't show any water but if you press R and enter the inventory it will show the water. I have gotten in the habit of always checking that way.
---
I use a mix of legendary wood armor and you can apply the shrouded mod to legendary chameleon armor, which I have. In my testing Speed Demon in Shrouded Wood Armor didn't seem to help my sneak speed.
---
I keep two sets of armor on me, wood for 90% of the time and a set of combat for when shit gets heavy. Both of Which have been repaired with the Fix It Good Perk.
---
Now sure I would put it that way m8 but I do agree that it is mind blowing that this stuff was never tested.  A gun that break in 1 or 2 mags should have never made it to release. 
---
my very first time in the armory there were two calibrated shocks. I bought them up before i even knew i would be able to craft X01 PA. I then got the plans and farmed up the materials to build them and when i was building the legs (the last pieces) it auto-scrapped my calibrated shocks. 
---
I spent about 5 hours over the next week server hopping and checking for them and no luck. that was about a month ago and i still server hop two or three times every session looking for them but havent seen one since.

I just got a second one for T60 so farmed up a set of that and finally got out of my excavator armor yesterday. 
---
Update: all plans available to a vendor are now available at all times form that vendor thanks to an update. Plans form players are commonly 50%.
---
&gt;world quest 
---
the wiki lists it as an event. 
---
seeing as there is still plenty of time before we see this, they can easily add additional quests, events and content before it launches. just needs a patch.
---
Clearly you haven't seen the extra glossy ghouls yet
---
Please god don't make vaults something that take more than 45 minutes to complete.
---
I do wonder if they'll cycle back someday and make it available again, for another "limited" time.  Easier than generating new content, while still maintaining scarcity so that "gotta have it" impulse kicks in.  Decided to build a new camp for one of my characters and regretting I didn't buy the Red Rocket garage door now lol.
---
I quit a couple weeks ago. I just couldn't find any interesting weapons or armor to make the grind worth it. Over 200 hours and I lost my best gun that I spent nearly all my caps on in a trade. The RNG is garbage, the grind is garbage, and the game is empty. This was my first Fallout and I will NEVER buy another one.
---
I stopped by to check is anything had changed and it looks like it's even more brain numbing tedious than before. I was hoping for a new storyline, new nuke site, new ANYTHING lol. I apologize to the hardcore fans for any hurt feelings but I just needed to say my piece about this dumpster fire
---
A-fucking-men.
---
I wanted to play fallout, not "inventory management and bullet sponge saturator simulator 2076, now with old bugs!"
---
At least the dupers have enough materials to sustain themselves and not have to worry about shit. Meanwhile the honest folks are fucked.
---
Touché lol
---
Fallout 76 is an easy game, especially if you have played FO3/NV/ or FO4 before playing it.  Even if you have not, by level 20 you have the mechanics down and its just not hard.  You just have to use some common sens like preparation and recon and give some thought to tactics instead of trying to power through every enemy.  The game is mainstream gamers, it is not hard unless you make it so by not paying attention to detail.
---
I'm still trying to figure out why in a recent episode the show Project Blue Book changed the witnesses description of the creature (and the recreation thereof) to something completely different (it looked like a cross between an owl and a spooky tree).  Is the appearance of the creature copyrighted or otherwise unusable in such media?  Even the in-game appearance of the creature is very different than what the witnesses described, altered to look like a Zetan in power armor.
---
&gt; tag items either as items we want to keep
---
Yes I played a game a long while back - might have been BDO - where you could mark items in your inventory as trash and the next time you opened a vendor they were all sold automatically.
---
annnndd they were nerfed.. for fuck sake.
---
bethesda interprets our requests, as another pvp mode, because all fallouts were always based on combat and it is a priority and that is what everyone wants [https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/b/b0/Sarcasm\_Detector\_exploding.png/revision/latest?cb=20150903212721](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/b/b0/Sarcasm_Detector_exploding.png/revision/latest?cb=20150903212721)
---
This happened to me, even after deploying.
---
A previous patch fixed me though, fuckin ripskis if you're stuck that way.
---
&gt; Is there something I'm missing? Am I just playing the entire game wrong?? I really shouldn't have to completely avoid questing when that's the entire point of video games! 
---
I think the hard truth might be... yes you are doing something wrong. Even though it has the trappings of a survival game there is no scarcity of resources in FO76.
---
You're level 30, you don't need to spend ballistic fibre to maintain your armor. Just out-level it and pick up or craft new armor, which you can make out of easy to find materials like leather and steel.
---
Stop being encumbered. Drop all the guns except the one you've actually put perks into. If it's a lvl 5 legendary, drop it too. Go to a weapon bench and craft yourself a lvl 25/30 version or just kill some super mutants and pick up what they dropped.
---
I’m curious if there’s a plan for the pole hook in the game? I’m surprised they don’t have the X01 mod plans in the bunker as they put mutation serum recipes in there and the other P.A mod plans are with the respective faction vendors.
---
Do you have a link? Also I’m on ps4 if your talking about pc 
---
Hah, I call mine Gary (fo3 nod)
---
And everyone can one shot kill a Bloodied player, so, everybody wins?
---
Since laser rifles don’t have any armor piercing of their own, definitely get tank killer...
---
The problem is, your choices aren’t really complementary. I’m putting together a nukes and dragons build but both weapons will be underperforming with the perk spread. 
---
Rifles currently work best in a VATS and/or Stealth build; HW wants power armor and isn’t very good in VATS/ Stealth.
---
Even setting up perk card swaps isn’t very helpful because HW wants strength and a bit of Int for Stabilized and PA perks; rifles get nothing directly useful from strength and and best only need 5int for Gunsmith.
---
yea. Runescape is a grind. Destiny was a grind. This game is comparitivly a cake walk to those games. IT's no more grindy than you make it and it's hard at low levels. Huh, turn out, when you're a low level, the game is hard. Who would've thought...
---
And you can increase it later to level 45
---
A bit exaggerated saying nobody should have to level another 50 levels to "respec" when probably half the time leveling to 50 you ended up having to pick a perk that didn't help your build at all til you got one that you actually wanted...
---
"I built my character in a niche way and it doesn't play how I want it to play anymore, I deserve a respec." No. Just, no. The "nerfs" only hit like 3 perks not the entire list. You don't need a respec when realistically it's really only like 10 points between them. That's practically just a couple days grind honestly. 
---
Ah, yes, PC sorry,...
---
Hello! Thanks for reporting this. /u/NJohno321 I've sent you a PM asking for more details and account info.
---
I was just south of the Mystery Mansion. Thats in the forest, genius. 
---
Not that I give a shit whether you believe me or not, to be honest. But keep telling people who used to love the game to leave. See how that works out for you when you dont have one to play any longer. Because in case you havent noticed, this isnt an offline single player game.
---
The limbs are 32/72 for heavy studded leather and 35/45 for heavy BOS combat armor.
---
Its very dependent on people who come to the fight. Are their characters spec-ed correctly are they high enough level. Are there sufficient number of melee players. I suspect you had a good group of melee characters supporting you. I suspect you experience last night is no the normal now-a-days
---
i swear i watched other videos like this with same voice about how to build large building with just one foundation
---
I was headed that way. Just figured I would stop at the deposit en route to the mole miner areas. Thanks!
---
No worries, thanks for trying.
---
not if they're wearing sentinel, no.
---
Thing is, F76 is so casual and most aint gonna spend money in something that is so casual. When things come easy, then it is easy to give up on those things. The fact that Atoms are given out free and easy to obtain, aint gonna help either. Even if F76 was like highly reputable game, with big playerbase, I still wouldn't pay for skins, because I would be playing the game and earning those skins.
---
Interesting about the bulking. I guess my fear is I’ll want to build that next cool thing and not have the materials for it. That’s why I’m keeping 5 bulk of each
---
Level 88 here, never encountered the flatwoods monster :(
---
Only the peaceful version of the mothman, which was a nice encounter. 
---
I wonder if not attacking him makes any difference...
---
Thing is though, even those people who are happy to grind, don't like the way it's being done here.  I don't think anyone is particularly happy with this approach.
---
Haven't played melee in 76 yet but if I had to guess:
---
Nerd Rage (3)  
---
Power Patcher (3)  
---
First Aid (3)  
---
Makeshift Warrior (5)  
---
Rounding up to the nearest number divisible by 5 (1)
---
I had the health bar get stuck the last time I played too
---
Yeah. Respec as in completely being able to reallocate our special and perk points. Not 1 at a time but all at once. I don't wanna use rifles anymore since they suck, but heavy weapons, melee and shotguns. 
---
Whag system
---
Nothing, literally nothing, played untill level 150+, farming legendaries kept me for a while but i got tired of all those wood legs 1* items and i finally uninstalled.
---
Xbox One
---
Do recipes with the same bonus stack? Like would Mutant Hound Chops+10% and Glowing Meat Steak+10% combine for +20% melee damage?
---
XB1 also, and I've had 2 recent PVP encounters in as many days, that both left me less than happy with this game for different reasons.
---
1st was a level 90 +/- player attacking the CAMP (Shop) of my level 5 Chem Vendor character which I was teamed with at the time, so I travelled back to the camp with my level 115 Character (I have 2 Xboxes) and killed him for a 400+ cap bounty, but it continued, after 4 kills, and a rapidly decreasing bounty, he finally gave up, leaving me to a very time consuming and expensive rebuild.
---
2nd, was a lower level player attacking the CAMP of my level 115+ character, and taunting me, I could have server hopped, but seeing no one else in the area, I decided to deal with it and switched off Pacifist mode to kill him, after which a higher level player in stealth mode nearby, killed me, I quickly returned the favor, retrieved my junk that he stole, then turned pacifist back on, but that didn't stop him from quickly killing me again, then travelling away before I could re-spawn.
---
I lost a lot of high value junk in the 2nd encounter, as I had been farming materials to build another Excavator PA, but that one is not over yet, I will find him, when I also have a team mate to help, and give him a lesson in Griefing, Those Orbital Strike grenades are good for something.
---
As soon as I saw on the first set of patch notes that they were nerfing xp from mobs I knew the game was in trouble. Bethesda has no new content coming any time soon so they have to nerf things and making them more tedious so people stay on longer to farm. All 76 is just Bethesda milking the creation engine one last time before they FINALLY have to put it out to pasture and thank God it's about time
---
Cosmetic iten loots? Fuck no!
---
Been a problem since launch
---
Spot on assessment.
---
Not to mention that every fucking enemy in the game other than scorched are just ridiculous damage sponges. Just had to shoot a level 24 Assaultron 10 times with a level 30 combat rifle. And this is WITH all six Rifleman perks, and ignoring 24% of fucking armor. With the wonky hitboxes and lag, plus the idiot AI...its just not fun any more. 
---
And thats what it boils down to: The fun is gone. Simple as that. 
---
does wearing hazmat suit under PA a actually work? i thought everything was negated when u enter PA.
---
I can predict the most Bethesda solution for this, too.
---
Here's the sane and logical response to the issue:  
---
"Oh, well if this piece of armor takes 5 leather and 2 steel to make, let's make sure it only costs 2 leather and 1 steel to repair instead of 5 leather, 1 steel, 2 adhesive, 8 ballistic fiber, and 9 screws"
---
Here's the Bethesda response to this issue:  
---
"Oh, well if this piece of armor takes 5 leather and 2 steel to make, and repairing it costs 5 leather, 1 steel, 2 adhesive, 8 ballistic fiber, and 9 screws, we should make sure that when you're crafting it, it costs 9 leather, 5 steel, 6 adhesive, 12 ballistic fiber and 15 screws to craft it.
---
This is what all of their other "solutions" has been like. I see no reason for them to stop now.
---
Appreciate you taking the time to write that all out. You used good examples to illustrate your point.
---
This whole "*it's lore and not story*" is the latest way of legitimising people saying there's no story IMO. You also said above "*the story of 76 doesn't work*". So there's a story. How good it is or isn't... not my point. I'm saying there's a main story. That's it.
---
Also I agree that there's some very well written side quests. The above ranger and his dog isn't even a quest. It's just good environmental story telling. It doesn't need to tie into the main quest and it would be so easy to miss.
---
Tagging in so I can find this again, definately interested in the mutations, took me forever to get marsupial and dont want to risk getting something i dont want the old go swimming and mutate fun way.
---
Define normal
---
Idk then, but im also thinking to sell it
---
Make more legendaries spawn in the world and less at the Whitespring.
---
Allow good loot to spawn in containers in the world to further encourage exploration.
---
I'm amazed when I read the amount of high level players who have never encountered a mega sloth, hermit crab, epic behemoth, or even fog crawlers. So many players have wasted hours grinding the slot machines at the Whitespring. It's sad.
---
&gt;  it's being made more TEDIOUS.
---
That is the exact Word: TEDIOUS.
---
And I suspect why this happens. They don't PLAY the game. And they don't rent pro playtesters to play for them. 
---
Anyone who plays the game for real will find all those TEDIOUS design features, that could be easily fixed to make the game more rational and funny:
---
- perk swapping
---
- reparations
---
- obssesive demand of food drink. Average daily wastelander diet: 15 kg of meat, 10 liter of soup, 10 liter of juice.
---
- user friendly stash availability of materials to build/craft/repair ( zero weight, max 500? )
---
- collectables imposible to collect due weight limitations...
---
It’s different when mommy’s credit card didn’t pay for this POS.
---
To be fair, without a cap limit, it would be ridiculously easy to get rich.  I must have dropped thousands of caps worth of junk just because I know I'll get more than enough to sell again before the vendors caps refreshes.
---
Maybe they desperately needed Radaway.
---
Wait... are you telling me that repairing things to 200% increases  the damage?
---
You want a cookie? What's the point of posting? Do you want help?
---

---
This is kind of the bare essentials; rank up the 1stars as you see fit, or grab utility perks elsewhere. I wouldn’t recommend building into stealth/vats, because energy rifles cant be silenced and if you’re in PA your stealth already sucks.
---
True, I just don't wanna risk getting them from dupers. Then again I'm probably likely to find a few legit sourced ones out there.
---
You, unfortunatelly,spoke the truth
---
Every time you miss one shot it resets and no one getting or big sneak crits cause you have to build the damage up id stick with bloodied
---
God, the gutsys are SO unbalanced. Fucking things take dozens of any ammo to take down, and they can annihilate you in like five shots in full power armor? Fuck outta here, that's asinine design.
---
Well, it’s hard to believe someone else hasn’t found and posted about it yet. It’s telling when Google comes up empty handed.
---
Yeah,I want help.
---
Weapon and perk nerfs? Are you fucking serious? Stop crying that Bethesda took away your godly TSE for fuck sake. For all the people actually playing the game for the last few months without one shotting everything that moved there have been no changes to weapon damage. 
---
My personal Handmade 
---
Receiver: Hardened Semi Auto
---
Barrel: Short Aligned

Stock: True (only other one aside from base I've unlocked)
---
Mag: One of the Armor Penetrating ones ( sorry for being vague but I'm at work now and can't check)
---
Sight: Short Scope
---
Muzzle: Muzzle Break
---
You’re right, thanks!
---
dick
---
Yeah serums definitely bypass starched genes. I've taken them before with it active and it works. I usually prefer to take it off though, _just in case_.
---
I had something similar happen in a whitespring nuke zone. I had full PA, and a 3\* armor pen. shotgun. A melee guy in a hazmat suit attacked me, and upon me critting him with the shotgun from extremely close range he went down to almost no health, and then all the way back to full health. Though maybe he stimpacked, but then he proceeded to take 0 damage from me until he 1 shot me with a deathclaw glove. I one shot his friend in PA though... made no sense really.
---
Yeah,  Bethesda never has NPCs. So stoopid. 
---
No. I modded FO4 to be harder. More enemies, tough enemies, harder damage guns, more survival elements... I like this game being hard. Instead of 1 shotting everything I'm 4 or 5 shotting everything.
---
I just put it down today, too. Level 22 Gulper and level 24 Assaultron taking 10+ shots each. EACH! With all SIX rifleman perks, and ignoring 24% of armor with rifles, while using a level 30 Combat Rifle with the damage bonus Receiver and AP Mag. 
---
Its fucking tedious. As hell. Especially since every fight just devolves into the suicidal enemy rushing you while you stand toe to toe exchanging shots. Its got to be the worst shooter AI since Fallout 3. This is ridiculous, unfun tedium and despite trying desperately to love the game, thats it, I am done.
---
I've plenty. Would have been happy to give it, but not open up trading.
---
Unless you are selling water, 2 small purifiers should do fine
---
But furious increases damage with every hit to the same target, so you could stack it fast I would think, unless there is some cap on it.
---
Until they fix the mutation buff, I’m certainly enjoying them myself. 
---
Any chance you've been banned?  I have no idea what that looks like after the fact.  Check the email address associated with your Bethesda account if you haven't already (and check spam) to see if you maybe got banned for something.
---
XBox version of the game has been up and running the entire time other than three maintenance windows so far this year.
---
As facetious and funny as this is, the bit about Power Armor may be actually intended.
---
In Power Armor, you stagger much less and your limbs can't be crippled, which is good, because the big end game enemies like Deathclaws, Yao Guais, and Scorchbeasts LOVE crippling you and locking you into stunned animations. Durability is WAY higher in PA, to the point that it feels like it wears down a tenth as fast as normal Armor. You can also a have resistances of 500-600+ in PA without relying on perks to boost it (Except Fix it Good, which you equip once to repair then remove). AND PA has a hidden buff to Radiation Resistance, and possibly incoming damage as well, but I can't confirm that.
---
After the last update, I finally gave up on running around without PA and I only regret not switching over sooner. It's SO much easier now. The balance is DEFINITELY in favor of PA being your Level 50+ gear.
---
My group started the Excavator armor quest by looking at a poster on the wall of the Charleston Fire Dept (Fire Breather's station) in the Ash Heap region. You have to be level 25 or higher for the quest line to register. 
---
Make sure you bring lots of black titanium, which you can get it you're willing to take the gorge junkyard public workshop. 
---
Haha that sound hilarious 
---
I like that the stories don't center around me again. I like that I'm not, once again, the *OnLy OnE* who can change/save the world.
---
This hero complex shit that Bethesda keeps escalating was getting old.
---
Is it actually easy to obtain? The first 3000 are for sure but then?
---
All it would take to let players sink that initial pool of atoms would be a nice costume and gun skin for a combined 3k.
---
Any upcoming MTX from that point on would require purchases.
---
But yeah, the competitive pvp aspects would have to live up to the promise for players to even want to be the shiny badass teabagging your corpse.
---
He can start the quest right now in order to obtain the Excavator PA plans, it's only that he can't *finish* it before level 25 (because he'll have to equip the PA to do so). Just sneak into the Garrahan HQ building and access a certain terminal in R&amp;D, but be aware that there is a wendigo down there that will make your visit go south rapidly (hence I wrote, sneak in there).
---
See how players enjoy being powerful? Please stop taking this feeling away from us! (No hate, just honesty). 
---
OP likes that he can 1 shot ghouls, dont see this as "ghoul slayers is outperforming other mods (players like it) so we will nerf it 500%, making it heal ghouls". Please make niche weapons MORE viable. If we need a specific weapon vs a specific enemy archetype, that particular affix should be stronger than any other - vs that enemy type. 
---
I.e. a Hunters weapon should always do the most to animals, why does bloodied surpass it in every way? (Please GOD do not nerf bloodied, that is not is needed. Buff the niche effects to be stronger)
---
Can we get some buffs for once?
---
That's what she said!
---
I'm the dick? Someone just comes on here and just complains without asking for help and ends with I'm selling? What's the damn point?
---
I was wondering if it was just me... I travel a ton for work so have little time to play. I am probably only level 16 or so and logged in for the first time yesterday after not playing for probably at least a month and a half. I was shooting at a fucking level 1 
---
molerat that refused to die. 
---
That, combined with having to rebuild my camp every damned time makes me want to say screw it and go back to playing GoW 4 or something. 
---
I looted the head and tattered costume in the first two weeks.  Not that rare.
---
It wouldn’t make sense if I was. I haven’t been doing anything unusual. I’ve been playing the game completely by the rules so maybe mistakenly banned? I will check
---
theres a super mutant camp within arms reach.  your camp must get hit all the time by them.
---
There doesnt need to be a point most of the time. Ome of the main topics of this subreddit us to share problems. Sometimes people help, other times people dont.
---
I would suggest keeping a low count of everything, and stock up on items you know you frequently use. I always keep large amounts of: steel ore, plastic, cloth, lead, gunpowder, aluminum, rubber, acid. Then about 25-50 of everything else. It is fairly easy to farm specific materials, the only one I have had trouble with is acid which is why I built a camp around an acid extractor. 50 is usually enough to build 1 of something you want, and if you want lots more than just make a point to look for only that material using your pip-boy to track the specific component.
---
This should help:

---
Holy crap! Really? That's hilarious.
---
I play less now than I did in the beginning, having completed the main quest, with the exception of launching a nuke. I just don’t really care about doing that. I’m not really into loot grinding and having participated in multiple Queen fights it seems kind of pointless to repeat it from a story perspective.
---
I still play at least a little bit most days and had no expectation that I would play for 5+ hours a day forever. I’ve always loved Fallout games for the exploration, deep world building and lore. 
---
Even with over 250 hours in the game there are still impactful things I’m seeing for the first time. I have at least 20 map markers I haven’t even been to yet, and more pop up every time I explore. I listen to every holotape, read every terminal entry, check every container...this type of exploration takes a lot of time and really only works solo—but is just as satisfying, if not more so than previous Fallout titles, at least in my opinion.
---
Besides exploring I do enjoy bounty hunting, but that’s essentially the extent of my PvP. Tracking a player for miles on the map, building tension, waiting for just the right moment to strike is great. 
---
I sometimes take workshops to get plans and collect resources for crafting or selling—but exploration usually yields a better resource haul if I don’t need a lot of something specific. 
---
I’ve also started meeting low/mid level players and offering to guide them in more challenging areas they want to visit. Playing the bodyguard for a level 20 so they can get through Whitespring for the Order of Mysteries or get through the Wendigo cave has been more fun than I anticipated. 
---
TLDR: I play less than I did in the beginning, but still find plenty of things to do. 
---
I need to read up on the flatwoods monster (the real one not the in game one) but I doubt they could copyright the apearance if the in game one looks like eyewitness accounts it'd be like owning the copyright to bigfoot 
---
good post.
---
OP had good points, for sure, but he is obvious that he is also terrible at playing the game.
---
Dont forget, if you want to quest at Top of the World, you have to call in sick and do it at 8am on a Tuesday morning, to avoid the area being cluttered with level 124 players and level 65+ enemies. 
---
That they cannot even group similar levels on a server has to be one of the dumbest issues in modern online gaming. I mean, how hard could that really be? Dont block playing with friends, but outside of that, group people by levels.
---
There is no confirmation that any trade exploit or "stealing items" ever existed.  
---
People intentionally tried to duplicate this claim and could not.  
---
I wouldn't worry about it.  Also, their lack of logical conversation may have just been due to age.
---
Whatever they did the lastest patch that limits the number of people using crafting benches messed everything up. 
---
Melee build?
---
I put my guns away after the nerf. An automatic handmade and an automatic radium rifle. I blow through 600 rounds trying to clear the outside of West Tek now and my gun breaks from full health bye the end of the battle. 600 rounds of ammo takes a while to farm plus the mats to repair my gun.
---
I too run with a Super Sledge now and it's lame.
---
I don’t think you know what daily events are exactly. They aren’t the regular events because the timeout thing has nothing to do with them.
---
Ugh, sorry to hear man :/ I did make that mistake a few weeks back, so I am super careful with Starched these days :)
---
Too bad you could just walk right over it....
---
Because it is sh#tty design and people with actual firepower are tired of them doing the hardwork while level 30 come to SBQ just to get same reward as those who actually do something. 
---
Is there anywhere that has a good current spec list? Newb just started this weekend.
---
Harder? It's made to help you appreciate the game better
---
Genius.
---
Halftime...halftime never changes...
---
Nah, it will stay but nothing new could be built that way.
---
Nice, provide us with any updates if that spot is it?
---
A wonderful idea, in my opinion, would be two or three vaults opening up at once. This could unlock a series of quests to restore power, and awaken the dwellers inside. After doing a short series of quests or tasks for each, you build up some rep for each vault, and then have the ability to form an alliance between the three vaults, unlocking an economy. Think Grand Exchange from RuneScape. I'll leave the clever name/acronym up to y'all to figure out. I'm too sleepy. 
---
&gt; Am I just playing the entire game wrong?? 
---
Honestly... I think so, I think we all are. This game isn't FO4, and I think it was designed to be a struggle from day 1 to day 1000. Which is a concept that personally excites me, as I feel most RPGs (especially Bethesdas) start hard and get easy. Not really the kind of difficulty I grew up with. Anyway what I'm saying is: We're all playing the game the way we think it should be played, and not the way Bethesda wants us to. 
---
Amen man! Took the words right out of my mouth. I’m all for spending a couple extra bullets on enemies but I’m so sick of farming for junk and repairing weapons that I could puke. At this point it’s the cool people that I’ve meet over the past couple months that are keeping me playing. 
---
I started the game as a "non-PA stealth sniper", and I found that my desired play style was not going to be nearly as successful as others, so I adapted. I soon went to a stealth-boy x-01 sniper, and then started carrying a backup melee. Now, I am 50/50 rifles and melee, because it takes a lot of levels to "fix" my desired build into something that will actually be good in this game. 
---
Oh, please post when you're done.
---
I'm sure someone is working on it. Problem is most of the online info is outdated since the patches
---
Create a character using SMG named "roland" and go for this outfit...
---
i was server hopping yesterday, farming watoga for PA pieces (lvl 60 something) and loaded into one server where scorched earth was going down. I decided today was the day i was going in!
---
I ran to the station, dumped my junk, grabbed all my stimpaks and charged in, hell bent on keeping trash mobs off the heavies and ready to stim whoever fell!
---
I got into the nuke zone just in time to pass everyone on their way out...
---
what a massive let down, lol. 
---
Can I get all your weapons and armor before u get banned? 
---
I got killed by a Super Mutant Suicider because a mix of lag and him eating bullets like fancy lads!
---
Just call it energy weapons, they won't touch it.
---
Nope none scraped those also.
---
At level 30 your missing alot of the perks that make the game easy, like haven't even seen them yet.
---
Just west of wotoga is the monorail elovator you cannot miss it it's huge, just south of there is a mine with 100+ lead deposits plus iether scrapping every weapon you find with a very mobile base or planning ahead will make ammo so abundant you'll be dropping most of it.
---
A large portion of the scavenging for components  thing people seem to complain about is due to them looking in the wrong locations you generally won't find ballistic fiber in hospitals but it's abundant in military outposts especially fort defiance(also great for cloth aluminum plastic copper) but I will not spoil where that is as it's linked to the start of the BOS quests
---
Just keep playing and learn where certain components drop and memorize them and the game will become a walk in the park.
---
...doesn't work "for ME"....
---
Fixed that for you.
---
As a side note....we live in an age where people are publishing novels via Twitter and using Minecraft to make kids shows on Youtube...."Classic Storytelling" is dead. 
---
Someone high up is a totally incompetent cheapskate. Between probably not having enough people working on the game (squishing bugs AND eventual content updates), and all this nylon bag, blue FEMA tarp jacket nonsense, I really think the issue is one guy , who oversees all the expenditure. (An "Overseer" if you will.) Even if merch isn't under the studio purview, someone high up at Bethesda probably hired a shitty merch company for cheap. 
---
Had they thrown just a little more money at this game, it could have been good. Had they thrown more time at it, it could have been amazing.
---
The only reason we're still here is because we all see little golden nuggets of a good game in here. Of the great storytelling and engaging gameplay that we're used to. Its so sad all of us are basically out of patience now with these morons. 
---
Again, people at the top, NOT the devs. They're probably working their asses off and in tears due to stupid decisions made by managers. The game company boss in "Bandersnatch" comes to mind.
---
I think there's a rounding issue with the % increase at low damage. I had a furious drill with a carbide tip and it was garbage.
---
I really hope those get fixed.
---
How do you manage? I’m a shit player, as in “no skill whatsoever” and I’ve also been pretty damn unlucky with legendary drops—and yet I only died for the first time at level 22, and only a handful of times since. I just recently managed to launch my first nuke solo at level 70. Others (players with actual skills or better drops, I assume) do it at 50 or earlier.
---
This game may be many things, but “hard” isn’t one of them. 
---
same for me. 
---
In the patch notes there was a comment about a duping exploit that used Modus, assumed it had something to do with that. 
---
Just so you know, moving your camp omits the cost of repair. Just a suggestion. 
---
- obssesive demand of food drink. Average daily wastelander diet: 15 kg of meat, 15 liter of soup, 15 liter of juice.
---
Oh this old fallacy. Compare something shit to something even MORE shit to try and make it look better.
---
When you have to compare this to garbage like Runescape in order to try (in vain) to make it look reasonable, you're argument is already DOA.
---
&gt; in case I have to fight a Ban.
---
Knowingly going somewhere you shouldn't isn't exactly a strong position to take on fighting a ban.
---
If they ban you it's understandable and justifiable.
---
The PA glitch has been in the game for awhile and is a good way to enter someone's base if locked.
---
Sounds about right. 
---
Just hit VATS and you will fast travel with your Super Sledge at the speed of a bullet.
---
I’d say it’s more of an alien parasite bursting out of a torso.
---
I haven't seen any furious melee yet, but my wife has a handmade that wrecks everything.
---
EVERY online game is fun for the first week and it only goes down from there because no developer can please everyone and the loudest whiniest bitchiest posters are the ones they listen to. 
---
The meat hook, pole hook, and sickle would work good as well...
---
Honestly I don't really know. Just something I've always done.  I Still have to use radaways and rad-x too
---
My TSE gatling gun is significantly weaker than my bloodied explosive gatling gun. No offense but you are making shit up
---
I think they should cut the health of the enemies by half maybe even more. The gunplay feels very very weak if enemies are this tanky. Legendaries should be buffed hard! Most legendaries i get are useless and you cant do anything with them. Maybe you could scrap them to gain rare materials to updgrade your old legendaries
---
No. The game needs to be harder. You guys are immense crybabies asking them to literally dumb down the game so much to the point where character builds don't matter.
---
They need to matter. The game needs to stop being such a cakewalk.
---
Campfires are the golden ticket to everything it seems
---
I think its just in case u accidently exit ur PA in the Nuke Zone so u wont get fked up. Like when u loot a Corpse or so.
---
"who is this lusty assaultron?"
---
I don't think enough of the benefits from bloody melee transfers to ranged. More mutations affect melee and so do perks. The only ones to transfer would be adrenaline mutation and nerd rage perk. Everything else specifies melee
---
The best perk to go with anti armor/furious would be either increased fire rate or +10% aiming bonus. Probably one would be better than the other for each combination. Maybe increased fire rate with anti-armor and aiming bonus for Furious as that bonus caps at around 50%
---
Explosive is still best for Bloody/Two Shot/Berserker/Junkie's/Instigating. Instigating Explosive is best for all enemies except for sustained fights, then BE Rifles and TSE shotguns, as shotguns still benefit from Explosive more and more pellets is more DPS for Explosive shotguns
---
There is a YT video that plays the various recordings in order that reveal what went down at the bunker and it is very revealing.  The Enclave in WV was basically an extension of the will the leader there, and Modus became damaged at some point, and doubly suspect, but still trying to carry out the orders of men long dead.  The player who follows the main quest line turns what is left of the Enclave to their own purposes, not the other way around.  After that the Modus is just a vendor and event reward disperser.  After a certain point the events have little to no real purpose beyond the meager material rewards and I hope that is changed at some point.
---
I also played the Anthem demo, and noped the fuck back to FO76. If nothing else, it certainly served to put things in perspective. 
---
Your views are what I learned too. It may vary a bit on other guns, but yeah, the couple I tried with, I had similar math. I didn’t actually try it in the game though, to see if maybe the tooltips and wording were weird; someone speculated that maybe it did the standard receiver damage, +50% vs scorched, but the tooltip was showing the standard receiver with the -20% vs everything else. If it was a standard receiver underneath, 50% more would make it better than a hardened receiver... but you’d have to test in game vs a hardened gun of the same type to find out. 
---
When I checked at GameStop I found it in the 3 games for $80 bin.
---
The current plan is for this to be addressed in the next patch. 
---
The game is not fun. The daily grind for... atoms? caps? What are we grinding for and whatever it is they envisioned us doing, it's not fun. The bugs I can forgive. The nerfs I can understand. But they've made the game harder, weapons less OP, nerfed WS xp, and done a bunch of minor stuff that simply detracts from the game and all the while they've done nothing to address the lack of game content.
---
They rushed the game and it should have been in beta for a month instead of as a beta-teaser for hours-at-a-time on weird days at weird time slots. What we have right now is perhaps what a late beta build of FO76 should have been.
---
Winner winner chicken dinner...oh wait...its gone...😂
---
&gt; Like can you imagine if after months of waiting it turns out that all the additional PVE content is like, an area the size of one of the silos that you can run in like 45 minutes. 
---
This *is* what I imagine. Hoping for anything more is a recipe for the same disappointment you've been felling the past 2 months.
---
Feel free to leave the game as stated above but if you’re around the mystery mansion there is a fissure site very near there. That could very easily explain your woes.
---
I’m with you on a decent amount of stuff here but the caps thing is nonsense. There’s a chance at 1,400 caps per day. It does depend on how much of the map you’ve discovered though. You should definitely be able to hit 800-1,000 currently. Find things that you can grab and sell. Golf Skirts / Outfits and Straight Jackets are huge money makers. Grab and sell everything. Make sure to look at your junk that can’t be bulked… it piles up if you don’t pay attention to it. Some of that can be sold as well. 
---
will do! Also, sorry that my post above was literally what this topic was about.. no location name, just basic info lol. At least I did give SOME details!
---
Just in case Beth steals the idea.
---
oooh that makes sense, thanks!
---
Fallout 76 is having an identity crisis and that is why the changes that are being made are making so many people angry.
---
Players either want a hardcore survival game (Fallout Survival Mode), a long and puzzle-filled adventure game(Fallout Series), or an Arcade-like PVP game (Not Fortnite, but Fortnite). No one game can be fun if it is trying to be all three. There are compromises being made that drain the fun for one type of player to balance another's gameplay.
---
That's the core of the problem. People want more ammo around because they want less interrupted action. Other people don't want more ammo around, because it is fun to go find it. Some people want human NPC's with interactive storytelling so they can experience the game. Others just want to shoot other players in rated competitions and don't need to know the story.
---
Any time Bethesda makes a change, they make 2/3rds of the player base angry. Which is why this game has and will continue to be a hot mess. It has attracted players that want different playing styles, and none of them are happy because the game isn't designed for them. It just have elements of the things they enjoy.
---
The game needs PVP mode, Hardcore Mode, and Adventure Mode. The current default game would be Default and would be Adventure Mode. Adventure mode would be balanced for PVE Co-Op, or (Easy Mode) you know, for the kids and the casuals.
---
Hardcore Mode would be PVP Adventure mode, balanced for PVP, but with survival in mind. Hardcore is where factions will live, co-op PVP. PVP will always be on. Hardcore and Adventure will get the storyline updates. With a balance for PVP the PVE in hardcore mode will be harder and more draining on resources than in Adventure Mode. Diseases last longer, thirst and food is worse, and your friend can kill you by accident.
---
PVP mode would be ranked gameplay with guns and ammo laying around everywhere. Just Kill, you join a match, not a server. This mode, your level determines you initial load outs, you play a match and there are winners and losers. When the match ends you have to join another match or you can change your loadout. A match would be "Defend powerplant" or "take such and such" or they would drop you in a town and it would be last team or last person to survive, capture the flag. Whatever. You would get a chance to build defenses if you were defending a workshop.
---
i found mine behind the clubhouse, next to the golfcarts. 
---
Stop playing like a twit. Super mutants are armored and you're using automatic weapons that already have the disadvantage of low base damage. I use a sniper build, a level 68 warlord goes down in at most 2-3 hits if I don't head shot one shot and even if I feel like getting close and using my semi auto handmade it's at most 6-7 each. 
---
We’re also playing American vault dwellers after a nuclear war with China; I’m not sure any of us would be celebrating Chinese New Year ;)
---
If you are active player and buy things you actually use, then I don't see you being short on Atoms. On my playtime, I bought 2 power armor skins, 1 armor skin, Minigun skin, camo sniper skin for hunting rifle, floor skin and now .44 skin. Even tho I don't play no longer, I still got .44 skin and I have still over 1000 atoms and I never played to do Atom challenges. I probably have some pointless easy "Take a photo" challenges to do that I can do, in case when game actually becomes meaningful and I need short Atom burst.
---
Speaking of foundations, is it a known thing that you can place a small purifier on them, even if you’re nowhere near the terrain? Or did I stumble on something everyone knew?
---
I have a cliff side base and my purifier is about 50 feet up on a foundation that juts out of the rock.
---
Todd Howard himself has comnented in this issue. He explained that the ability to destroy camos was never meant to be part of instigating and carrying on PvP.  It was meant as a tool to help prevent griefing.
---
Imagine this. I invite you to my camp.  Or trick into ending up there,  whatever. While you are looking around I slap a wall up and turn a previously open ended room into a box. Now what?  How do you get out if the camp isn't breakable?
---
Sure,  you say, but Beth could just make it so you can't build while another player is present. Well now somebody could wreck your camp and then go semi AFK in the middle and force you to server Hop to repair it. 
---
The balance is the hard part here. Beth maybe isn't doing the greatest job, but rest assured your camp being breakable was never meant to be a hindrance. It doesn't make it sting any less, but it is what it is. 
---
My problem I had last night was after killing a legendary 3⭐️ super mutant, another lobs a grenade and blows the body off the mountainside before I could loot it... please Bethesda could you make bodies not be catapulted so far away because of grenades? I spend about an hour looking for the body before giving up, I guess it was stuck the the trees or something.
---
Lol well in your defense, you stated that you couldn't remember the name of the location, but you definitely gave some more details and description of where to start looking. Even if that doesn't end up being the spot, it still sounds super cool
---
Lol no one new is going to play that hot garbage game. 
---
pretty sure she's still alive and there will be more added down the line. 
---
Wow, that's incredible!
---
A build-ruining patch not only kills your build, but kills your desire to grind enough to fix it.  Because what's to stop them from nerfing your next build?  
---
My build kinda sucks now, but I'm not investing the time to make a new one.  I can't trust them not to nerf it.
---
You just described my last two queen battles. Five players hiding in the back of the shed, three high level players trying to kill her, every one leaving after ten minutes because her health bar won’t move. 
---
Youtubers aren't harming fallout 76. Bethesda is harming fallout 76. Youtubers are just getting the word out.
---
If a newspaper reports something bad that's going on--do you blame the newspaper for it?
---
Radium actually heals enemies, it’s quite the joke.
---
You were going for a laugh, understandable
---
I love this idea, I wish we could record holotapes like this and leave them for other players.
---
If you think the game is hard, you specced your character wrong. Simple as that. Get perks that help with ares you think are unfair. If you have issues with armor, get the lucky break perk and the one where armor doesnt break as fast.
---
Can’t party unless my clothes are rare?  Rather exclusive. 
---
Farmhand clothes aren’t rare btw. 
---
Was happening before the hotfix too. I equipped some dromedary cards, but after topping up both food and water, the water meter would be down to red while food is not even half full. This is also on a non mutated character.
---
not yet, rather it is as if previous mistakes had fixed them with tape, they were repeated 
---
No but having to shoot level 24 enemies with a level 30 rifle, when you have all six rifleman perks and are ignoring 24% of armor, and your gun has Damage Boosting Receiver and AP mag...is annoying as hell. Its just plain stupid how badly this game is balanced.
---
That sounds pretty cool. 
---
I was just thinking about getting into a black suit and a sack hood, and then turning up near other players during the night and just... stand there, staring at them. 
---
Worked fine a week ago.
---
That’s amazing!
---
At least the 15 liters of juice will keep you regular.   
---
Be sure to pick up all the TP you can.   White gold.
---
Power armor + melee = easy mode , the game needs to be harder but not more grindy.  There is zero skill to the game as is.  We need more active skillful combat.
---
I feel like I'm the only person who played the Destiny 1 beta and made a decision then NOT to get the game.
---
The world ended and we still have to deal with that...? -__-)"
---
Umm, I didn't knowingly do this. Was just doing a daily quest. I pushed the share button after it happened.
---
That's too vague of a question.  What do you think is broken about it?
---
I've wheeled and dealed and traded to basically get all of my weapons TSE. Since the nerf the only weapons I have (TSE) are basically useless against anything that moves towards me. Anything that runs towards me manages to survive my exploding weapons and get close enough that I have to switch or I'll kill myself with my exploding weapons that tickle enemies. If I kill myself in two shots, enemies should die in the same timeframe 
---
I want help sounds nothing like I'm selling this game
---
What about the patch history of fallout 76 has made you think they can "easily patch in" anything at all?
---
Idk man, I haven't played the game in about 2 months.  I'm going to wait a year for the whole "this game doesn't suck anymore!" post, and then maybe spend half an hour enjoying the novelty of a non-trash Fallout 76 before signing off for good.
---
I had a crazy experience, first I choose a  stealth sniper build, but I found that melee was way too good and I decided to switch into a full “slugger” build. 
---
Almost 40 levels needed, but with nukes on whitesprings it was quite fast to do it.
---
Then tse era arrived, and melee was “nerfed”, so I decided to run a mixed build. 
---
Other 15 levels to adjust my SPECIAL points.
---
As soon as i finished it “TADAAAHHH” tse nerfed.
---
Other 15 levels wasted.
---
I’m level 150ish, 70 levels “turned into goo” (or a gory red paste) with a bad feeling: will Beth nerf melee too? 
---
I still need like 15 levels in order to make my build “perfect”, but i’m terrified to spend my points again.
---
Yes. Melee weapons damage gets higher when repaired beyond 100%. 
---
Is it still a bitch to respec? I stopped when they introduced respec and it wasnt worth it for me to grind 120-170 to respec.
---
Or Ultracite plans you can download now. 
---
Don't have any 50+, I'm a bit of an alt-oholic. So I'm very well versed in the low level grind. I'm confident enough in my abilities that I can take out a Huntersville full of level 68 super mutants at level 20 with no legendary gear. It just takes patience, knowledge of the AI, and a fair chunk of ammo. And a handful of stimpacks.
---
But a brand new player isn't going to be able to do these things or know the game the way I do. I trick out my gear as I level as soon as I'm able to, I use VATS to hit weak points and cripple melee, lots of hit and run tactics, and use of any explosives I can loot in the chaos.
---
It's the endgame that people want but the only loot is a few missile launchers and the key fragment for the Rose quest line.
---
My first run of a silo took me around 1:30, i had no idea what i was doing and it was just trial and error. Now it takes me around 25 mins with mainframe cores prepped. It's the same as any game the dungeons in WOW the first time took my guild alot longer than it did a few weeks later when we knew the tactics and just efficiently run through it.
---
Dude. You’re level 3. And said you’ve barely played. Take a breath. Yes. Obviously it gets easier. Trust me, you’ll have more RadAway and shit than you know what to do with. Stay with it. And once you start getting your perk cards and build figured out, things will get easier. 
---
its a video game, and there are a lot of realism aspects to it and I just answered OPs question from my personal opinion.   
---
If it were super realistic, nobody would play. A single stray bullet comes over and hits you in the leg, and now your character is limping for days, if not weeks. Then your character dies, oh well, no respawn, cause this is realistic. 
---
you don't need both of those at same time because you can change them out.  Run gunsmith while running around and weapon artisan only when you need to repair something.   
---
Not sure about energy weps, but max is 6 i believe to get all bonuses. 
---
This would work if they didn't make it now so that you could refrain from hearing other people's mics now :(
---
Yeah this is why this game will never really be balanced. They need to rework how DR works entirely or else, like you said, small damage with high rate of fire (either a knife or a minigun) are useless. Why do they think nobody min/maxing is using a 1 handed, well, anything?
---
For having made RPG's for over a decade, now, you would think that BGS would know a bit more about theorycrafting. It's like none of them are actually nerds.
---
Yeah, harder would actually be just fine by me too. It's low damage bullet sponge enemies that stink. I don't even just power armor normally, but sometimes the amount of damage things do just shooting at me is a joke.  
---
It's really faster paced combat that'd be more fun. 
---
So, basically, write events in the game for Bethesda because they can't be bothered to. :D
---
You're comparing fixing bugs to adding content, not the same thing. I didn't say it won't be buggy. My point is they can easily just add the code later to keep details from leaking early. In the meantime, they add the base framework.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
I used to just put on pacifist mode in case they got annoyed by me shadowing them and I’d follow them around trying to get at least one hit in before they steamrolled everything. It’s hard to do though when you’re actually try to accomplish something and they are going about their own business. 
---
I’m lvl 180 now and it’s equally annoying for us when a low lvl comes into white springs and spawns lvl 22 ghouls who drop poop legendaries and give nothing for xp. 
---
No lol
---
Needs to be some other solution then. For those of us that don't think to do scum of the earth things like trap people in our camps... ffs 
---
This is a fallout game, why didn't you destroy that raider base?
---
Better than the current end game content so far, lol
---
Sure, I didn't solo the queen and we had a mix of cahracters, but again I don't see what the problem is.  
---
We had a good mix of players, most above 50, some under 50. We had a balanced group. And we killed the queen fast.  
---
Isn't that kind of the point?  The SBQ is supposed to be the 'end boss'. She's tough, but killable. In fact, I've only ever failed to kill her once, and that was early morning on a Saturday.  
---
The long version or the short version? Lol
---
Are they unlocked? If so, random players who come across your camp can freely loot any unlocked resources. For this reason, I purposely lock some purifiers but leave some avail. for thirsty noobs. 
---
This.Right.Here.
---
Do you have two+ frames? After deleting an empty frame, while in my own, I had this happen to me.
---
Yeah it's not friendly to welcoming new players, which is troubling because we need new players very badly!!
---
I thought you needed gunsmith active whilst crafting. good to know thanks, if thats the case then I get to put two points elsewhere. I can get tank killer now.   
---
My post from a couple weeks back regarding the same thing.  [How about a karma system?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah07ah/how_about_a_karma_system/)
---
I think the last "Inside the vault" says that they plan on adding player shops. A place you can set up and run around and adventure while your items are set in an open market where players can come by and purchase your items that you have listed.
---
\+100 Internet points to you!
---
Pvp, the loot system, server stability, scorcubeast infinite screech attacking, infinite loading screens, getting stuck in PA, mesh glitches, perk bugs, bounty halving, ect.
---
Me and my friends play hide and seek in all sorts of interesting locations like the ws bunker the giant monorail elevator and a few of the large towns (Charleston lewisburg etc.) This is a really fun way to pass the time when you are feeling a little carefree.
---
Viable can have a broad definition, I see melee folks saying the build is not viable because they cannot attack flying objects.  I just shake my head.  
---
How do you get out of an enclosed space? Fast travel. 
---
I'm not even saying that the player should have an impact on the stories. Just bored of all the stories ending the same way. Spoiler alert, they all end with everyone dead. There's no suspense, no mystery, no reason to care.
---
Do any of you guys have an extra bag? 
---
That would just make the game faceroll easy.
---
bumping this after a month. just found this after wading through other subs. THANK YOU. 
---
Did 2 SBQ fights the other day post patch and had no issue killin her. In fact both times the fight was over in less then 5-10 minutes. And I was the only melee guy there, that I saw. There were only like 5-10 guys max. But the queen is very killable, and in a timely manner from what I saw. 
---
I'm starting to work on another character.  My main now is lvl 160 and almost complete except for my "dream" legendaries ie. Furious/Fast/Light gatlings, Furious/Swing/Light super sledge and full set of Vanguard (+one Chameleon piece) marine armor with weight reductions all around...  yeah, I'm likely never gonna be complete!  Melee/heavy gunner combo.
---
Decided to work on an unarmed mostly non-PA character, with rifle/stealth secondary.  Will run more mutations on him too.
---
Oh my gosh, this made my day 😂👍
---
Nice build! Would be nice as an adventurer to stumble upon something like that.
---
Also, I don't think it Justifiable to Ban someone for something they had no control over. I also see how many people get banned for things that was out of there control, Submit a ticket and never get a reply back... and end up perma banned. Unfortunately.. almost non of them have proof or make a paper trail. I on the other hand will try. It's BS people are getting banned over shit like this.
---
I doubt PSN will do that because of the tight relationship Bethesda seems to have with Microsoft. That being said, I thought this same thing and would be shocked if it wasn't on Live gold. Maybe game pass?
---
Hope i guess
---
And im building my build...Even tho im Level 105...
---
And its the critical rifleman build....
---
bumping this after a month. just found this after wading through other subs. THANK YOU.
---
It's a shame that you have to jump through so many hoops to do this. Building needs a good overhaul, I don't know how they downgraded from fo4.
---
Bethesda nailed large-scale things in this game. You can see that excavator from pretty much anywhere on the map. Same for the mansions on stilts, and the Watoga tower. This has awesome implications for Elder Scrolls VI. Remember the giant statue of Azura in Skyrim that you could only see if you were pretty close to it? Imagine being able to see it all the way from High Hrothgar.
---
While hidden, I have:  
---
* If I have too many throwables, I just bracket them with cryos or molotovs but not so close they take damage.
---
* Random sniper shots aimed at bottles, cans, pots &amp;c. near their location is also fun.
---
* Firing a .50 or LMG burst above their heads  
---
I don't do it too much but I was giggling like a little girl at their reactions.
---
Do not think even Beth is that bad that they aim for crazy inbalance. What I am trying to say is that i would like to overall see more focus om buffing up useless/boring gear/perks instead of nerfing stuff. I mean overall here. 
---
Like the TSE nerf was fine even it hit my TSE 50 cal MG very hard. It was needed it was taking away from the game. But TS nerf was not needed imo. Same with nerfing QOL perks when the game is a mess in many regards.
---
I agree that some melee builds and the sintinel/assasin gear combo for example needs a nerfs/tweaks. But players all need to consumer how many variabels that could be OP together is hard to see beforehand and there are plenty of items, mods and perks to combine. The game is massive when it comes to this aspect. Regardless that there is only one late game boss.
---
Tldr: agree that totally god mode combos should be balanced but Beth should think twice before Making stuff weaker / less fun. Overall
---
OMG yes. I'm a Garvey survivor myself! ✊
---
I like to find a few spots, and just grind them every day, regardless of level, just for mats, ammo, and weapons to scrap to learn mods. I start easy (Morgantown Airport) and then hit a few mines, or raider camps, the mezzanine level at Top of the World, and end at the raider camp just NE of Top.  Then scrap all, drop what I don’t need at the nearest station, and play some events or daily’s. Has helped me level up pretty steadily, and got me most of the mods needed to make better weapons for everyday use 
---
Hey, now.
---
I don't think so. This game has such a bad reputation that giving it away for free would spark more negative feedback than giving away a lesser known title.
---
Except there's tons of baffling design decisions that just flat out dont make any sense. Like energy weapon durability, the screwed up armor system carried from FO4.
---
It's not hard. It's annoying and obnoxious. The artificially make the game more grindy. They did that for a while, probably because people were leveling way too fast and reached the endgame within days, which is empty as fuck, unless you consider grinding nukezones for materials, levels and scorchbeast queens, rebuilding your camp every 3 days and trying to buy every plan as "endgame".
---
Honestly, I don't think the devs are capable of fixing this mess. They are completely clueless at this point and have no idea what to do. The only shit in this game that actually works is the fucking atomic store.
---
Yaaa...every time I go to log in I just think “Oh wait, before I can properly do a quest I need to go find food and water and repair my armor and get all ready before I even start.” 
---
And then I go play another game instead. 
---
When and if that’s what we get, it’s still just 24 people on a server of disparate levels who have to travel to your shop to see what you have on offer. 
---
Incredibly clunky compared to other solutions online games have been implementing for over a decade. 
---
Short version works for me.  Im sad that I didnt wait till level 50 to complete my quests. My all rise is like level 40.
---
I still don't get why people like you are giving bethesda so much leeway. They are a huge company, you are a consumer, give them some bloody reason to actually improve the games they make, why do you want to reward them for making games you have to keep justifying? I just don't get it
---
Man I feel you. I'ma level 20? (I don't even know anymore) and my friends as well as myself have basically stopped playing because of how Bethesda just keeps shafting the players. A damn shame seeing as we all paid 40 bucks for it because we saw potential in it.
---
I wonder... if this trick were used to fabricate walls / roof for a base, would that base then be truly nuke-proof?  I don't believe foundations are destroyed when in the blast zone of a nuke...
---
im experiencing the same bug.  i'm heavily speced and geared for full stealth/glass cannon build.  it's so broken i havent played seriously since jan 30th.  these players who claim "its always been bugged" are obviously not full stealth playstyle.  super mutants have very low perception, its silly they can snipe you like it's carlos hancock incarnate.  
---
Pretty much why I advise people to just go prepared at 25 with mats - once and done.  No real benefit to starting it sooner.  I went in there with full Raider PA so the Wendigo wasn't bad at all, came out in Excavator.
---
I horde a lot of armor and weapons so probably not ideal for me.
---
Oooooh nO YOU DIDN'T....! 
---
You wanna get pissed off? Toss your power armor on and go fight a Colonel Gutsy. Have fun getting merked in 5 shots while you empty magazines in to the robot like a madman.
---
I can't believe I'm not the only person who takes issue with the term "suffering" here. :)
---
&gt;What I don't like is how repairing shit costs more than it does to just make a new one
---
Exactly my opinion. I don't think I will ever understand that particular design choice. It's one thing to frequently replace broken armour pieces, but when they happen to have a legendary perk you want to keep... 
---
Also uninstalling. Besides the multiple crashes the game is beyond boring and uneffective grinding. The only good thing about the game is the franchise name, that's it.
---
White Springs vendor beside the maintenance shop
---
Toxic larrys meat n go had like 5 spawn for me idk if they share respawn with other enemys 
---
I'm having the same issue when I fast travel to Harper's Ferry too. Yes I happen to be in Excavator. It has happened so much since the Jan. 14th patch, I'm not sure if it is raining every time. Then It continues when I try to fast travel anywhere else once effected. The only fix I've found is to completely exit and close the game app then restart. I'm PS4 by the way if there is a difference
---
Melee weapons need some nerfing, and ranged weapons need a buff.  This is not Skyrim. The extreme builds that do crazy high need damage of either ranged or melee to be given more of downside. 
---
Except the nerfs rendered explosives builds in general shit entirely. Games in general tend to hand out respecs if they make changes that could clearly make or break builds. Warframe for example handed everyone free forma packs when they did the mass weapon rebalance early last year.
---
I have the exact same issue.  Did you find a fix? 
---
I want a raid, because it's not hard to get 4 people together. It's not like trying to get 40 man molting core.
---
I want a real raid. Hordes of enemies. And tons of loot. Bring it on Todd Howard. 
---
Why are you here then? 
---
Welcome to the club! 😒

---

---
Though funny, That is just not a relevant comment as applied to the combat system.
---
LOL. Poor little level 30 having a tough time. It does take some learning and certainly inventory management to play this game well.
---
 I run almost unarmored chars into the hardest areas of the game 'cause its fun. Now I have 2 chars in the catbird seat at level 52. As I know a lot about the game I have little trouble arranging my stuff and keeping healthy. 
---
 Now a few days ago I went into Westec drunk. Did OK for a while but got wrecked and that took a day of recovery and equipment fixing. I fucked up. That's rare. 
---
Thank you!
---
It's subjective, I've been enjoying the hell out of the game, but your mileage may vary. The exploration, gun play, finding things are all very fun to me. My play time is limited so I could understand if a person played this 8 hours a day for a week it would be a chore, maybe an hour a day is all I can seem to get in.
---
I get that.  I'm not trying to make assumptions or offer alternatives. I'm just passing on what the Man himself said. I hate the idea that my hours and hours of work to make a happy inviting base camp to any player that wants to use it can go up in flames in seconds because some dick thinks it's funny or is looking for a fight. I'm just passing on the official answer Todd Howard gave to the same question. 
---
You are totally right. But it became like more tedious. And if you max your build out at 50, it becomes much easier to maintain ammo, armor and all that. I currently have no real problem keeping up and i like being the scorchbeast target bc i take nearly no damage. Ammo is a tough one tho. I always go farm for lead and steel and that becomes boring pretty fast. Ammosmith helps. 
---
Like, Damaged Scorch Beasts are grounded for 30 seconds.  
---
It would be nicer as a dart for the Syringer because of the lowered weight in addition to making the Syringer actually useful.
---
I did get all of those, but here's the thing:
---
Need rage seemed attractive at first but with melee, 20% life is dangerous, especially when SBQ can do about 25%  health damage in a swing. Plus I use born survivor so I can stim at 20% while still attacking and not having to retreat to stim. So I had to take that out. (it is something I'm working towards on my sniper though since he's Unyielding anyway). 
---
Power patcher seemed attractive at first also, but with fix it good, it just wasn't really relevant since I rarely had to repair armor to begin with. I still have it and use it to have cheaper repairs when u actually need it, but pretty rare. 
---
First aid was relevant during leveling, but with my health bar being at least 50% radiated, it wasn't that big of a deal with the number of stimpacks I had. I still use it sometimes though, especially during SBQ fights. 
---
Makeshift warrior is mandatory, with the amount of swings and hits, it's durability plus weaponsmith makes it last extremely long time. 
---
But all in all, I end up swapping some in and out. 
---
Glad you like it 
---
If they’re going to make it harder or more tedious at least give us better loot for our work. At this point I’m pretty much done with the game because there’s no incentive to do anything else.

---
In my opinion, id say the level of each area really depends on personal build etc however as a loose guide it stands up. Just pick a few places and explore and clear and rinse and repeat. It gives it that Fallout exploring feels if you like :)
---
The missions list may contain light spoilers, however there are a few Side Missions that reward starter legendary's which if you leave till 45 / 50 will reward max level items, so it could be worth while checking the rewards and avoiding them few missions in till higher level, depending on how you feel about the rewards. Personally I didn't feel they were worth waiting for 50 for as you can Farm legendary quite easily at level 40+
---
Also FYI you can do the Mission that rewards the Excavator PA plans at 25 which is a pretty cool mission and helps with inventory space for junk / material run's.
---
I've heard of this tactic for "duper hunters".  People who think they are doing the game a favor by acting like dickheads.
---
Just because 3 people are hanging out in an area doesn't mean they are duping.  They could just be trading nuked flora they just farmed to the one guy who needed them.  But, nah, gotta be dupers.  So smash the camp up when they don't open up the trade menu. 
---
This is what many developers fail to understand. Harder doesn’t mean you starve to death within minutes and it becomes a pain to find resources to actually PLAY the game normally. Harder means the AI is smarter and it should take you longer to get upper level stuff, not dying every 20 seconds because you’re not able to build the most basic set of armor. 
---
Minecraft got this right, You can do many things with the most basic stuff, but you gotta grind and mine a lot to get end level stuff, enchantments, potions, prismarine and all of that. 
---
This isnt about TSE, the entire explosives line of weapons got shit on due to the blanket nerf. Maybe actually look into why people are complaining instead of spouting drivel.
---
It usually has more time u are just unlucky
---
You're welcome
---
You can't pick and choose what parts of realism you want in games tho &gt;.&lt; 
---
OP has a valid point. Vendor caps are stupidly low and it's brutal now with large plan costs which is literally my end game.
---
"Just redo literally everything because the devs fucked up lol."
---
I think they just screwed up the beginning. People been leveling way too fast. Now there is no lategame for them. I literally don't know what I should do. I have every possible plan from the scorchbeast queen (at least I think so), I have every plan for my camp, I have 40.000 caps ... like, what should I do in this game? There is nothing to do, it's boring, the only thing that keeps me entertained for an hour or two is the camp system when I move it for the 10.000th time.
---
I managed it with about a minute left, over encumbered. Go for the frogs first and use VATS for the fireflies 
---
Dont worry bro, you arent going to get banned. Thousands of people have gone into the vaults and there is nothing in there to take except metabolux syringes which do nothing. They aren't gonna ban thousands of people just for seeing the vault when it has 0 effect on other players and it doesn't give them any unfair advantage.

I knew you didn't solo it. Even two or three good melee characters can wreck her. I suspect most of the people complaining are rifle builds. Last time I fought her she was doing the no damage glitch so its became one of the three losses I have in queen fight out of probably 70+ fights. I use to do as many as three a night depending on the group I rolled with. For me its not too hard its the glitching that screws up the Queen fight
---
I agree friend. Beth is in so deep trying to get everything straightened out a solution probably won't be had soon. They seem to be working pretty hard to get their game on point. It's apparently an uphill battle on their end, and they are having a hard time of it though. 
---
TSE still trumps AAE since AA does not affect explosive damage. BE reigns supreme but only if you're one of the few who got in on the last dupe craze and managed to snag a weapon of choice. So the bell curve of available weapons will mean that TSE is probably the best choice for most players, regardless of the nerfs to TS and E. SBQ is still reasonably doable for most players as long as the group clearing her is not comprised of potatoes who don't know how to bring her down (clear her adds or cripple) and apply cryo on her to keep her slow and subdued. 
---
The hate on TSE nerfs is pretty much overblown and mostly because everyone and their mother has a TSE gun due to widespread duping. But a group of average players, using average available guns (I now consider TSE as part of the average due to availability) should on average be able to take down SBQ without spending too much ammo or stims. If you have trouble, take a look around you and the level 40 with the modified board doing melee and the level 100 who is sitting in the bunker taking potshots with a shotgun at max range is probably not going to help you.
---
Yep, exactly this! I wouldn’t even mind if the grind payed off with some kind of reward, but there is no point to killing the queen, nuking Whitesprings, or any of the other end game tasks now. The loot is crap and even if you get something good it is most likely underpowered.
---
It can still be enjoyable as it's a Falllout online game.
---
The answer to your question though is NO it's still a broken buggy mess.
---
Patches have been weak and slow. There is still hope though.
---
I doubt that FO76 will ever reach that point tbh, it's probably suspended within this year.
---
Never thought about this to be honest, Fortnite has dedicated graphics settings for people with the different forms of colour blindness, always struck me as super thoughtful and inclusive, a shame BGS haven't implemented such.
---
Yeah I know that part.  But I guess I’m not getting the clues saved or something.  Do you need the tapes for it?
---
Although this would be extremely cool when placed in high traffic areas, it would definitely be a platform for trolling.
---
Perhaps a recorded greeting for when the player vending update drops? 
---
0 points in explosives and I still 1 hit charred Ghouls level 68 with 1 plasma grenade. They're not useless stop whining. 
---
Okay, 
---
So I have 5 in makeshift warrior, 5 in gunsmith, 5 in Demo expert. 
---
With so little other perks being relevant for melee builds, I decided to max intelligence for this character to be the "crafter" which is actually irrelevant also since theres no uniqueness in this game lol. But I do enjoy keeping my weapons at the best durability and with explosive guns like Fatman and missile launcher, they break extremely fast, so the gunsmith helps with their durability. 
---
I have special all over to augment for melee but the rest were just convenience. 
---
Take a picture and send it to Bethesda with your screen name 
---
I'm sort of confused. I've watched the video and it looks like he spawns in a cave.. but the cave is open which leads into Vault 63? 
---
I thought t gave you more time when you deposit the fluid.  I usually make about three trips up but I haven't done it a while.
---
I'm lvl 200+. Been looking for more content since lvl 60... but that's not why I left. It was the seemingly endless bugs and Bethesdas lack of "give a fuck" about their fans in this title. 
---
You cannot upgrade your existing armor. Items are level locked from the moment they spawn or are crafted. 
---
i didnt do a scientific test but i dont think cameleon stacks like fo4.  in FO4, you go full cameleon your stealth is amazinng.  in FO76, my last set is 4 chameleon and it was nowhere near as effective as my garb of mysteries with 20% sneak.
---
I feel opposite
---
If by upgrading u mean make light combat armor heavy, then no
---
My bad,he said he solo'd the silo. As to being 'extremely  unlikely' no one showed up to a queen fight,well,that's not nearly as unlikely as you think....
---
They're very easy to craft so it's not uncommon to have that many. Also, no you won't "get in trouble". I've crafted way more than 20 mutation serums in a matter of minutes. 
---
Rad suit means no armor though...
---
My Yao Guai named "Pete" would like a word with you.
---
 You want the BOS mod for Heavy Combat Armor. It makes quite a difference.
---
 I have BOS Heavy Combat at level 50 and its numbers, apart from rad resistance are about the same as level 35 Excavator Armor. I have Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs and I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and it does almost nothing.
---
 I take no damage from Scorchbeasts yelling at me and kill em' on a regular basis in my Heavy Combat. Did 3 level 80s yesterday outside Whitespring.
---
Thats awesome, but imagine if you could actually get a deathclaw themed PA in game it could have Deathclaw gauntlet arm mods, or a pretty cool looking helmet with the horns
---
Endgame in gaming is dead. Don't want too much game because gotta get the next one next year. Can't make decent rewards because all cosmetics are now microtransactions and you can't just get more and more power the more you play that makes power creep etc. Give me a game in the last 2 years with decent end game on pc
---
Using a ghoul as an example? Maybe actually compare overall damages against say, a super mutant and not something a simple breath can knock over.
---
Don't get me wrong, all factions are fleshed-out very well and people often disregard all the storytelling provided by notes and holotapes. I felt very much involved in the struggle of each faction; I was sad when I found Kesha's body, after hearing her voice on a holotape. I was pumped when I did the Firebreather exam. The quests surrounding the Mistress of Mystery felt like reading a gripping novel (or a comic book, for that matter). I did my best to follow Abbie's instructions to get the SDS going, so her work wouldn't have been in vain. I was really immersed in the story.
---
It's just that the Enclave feels the most Fallout-y. There's more to them than just mere survival and overcoming the scorched plague. They were around even before the bombs dropped and thus have resources the other factions could only dream of. MODUS in particular reminds me a lot about President Eden or Mr. House, both of which had a similarly rich background.
---
True story,  and incredibly helpful to some people. Other's, like myself, don't really have that option. My camp is built over three different tiers of land and will almost definitely not place anywhere other than where it is. 
---
To be sure,  I understand that that is my fault. I just want a camp that is unique, and more than a couple story box. 
---
Isn't the G.E.C.K in one of the vaults, the one with all the flora outside?
---
"Server problems' , i think they are lying. //
---
I thought about a second character. Honestly, I don’t see the point. The whole leveling system and perk card system is a neat idea. 
---
In practice it has a lot to be desired. 
---
Their wings do regenerate... at least the SBQ does.
---
This also happens if you blow up a car and it hits the whitesprings robots.  \*o hell, time to server hop\* 
---
This is because campfires are considered dirt for some reason. You can also plant crops and water purifiers on top of campfires.
---
makes sense now, thanks for the clarification 
---
No, you will not get in trouble, loads of folks running around with duped weapons still, they have no way of identifying them as duped as such.
---
People still play this game? 😂
---
Thesaurizethis!
---
I get that, but I'm into it. I get immersed by the entries, especially when I'm looking at a corpse while listening to their recorded voice.
---
I was around lvl 35 when I was sent to the Glassed Cavern for the first time. After having my heavily armored ass kicked verty thoroughly by the three Scorchbeasts and the couple of dozen lvl 68 Scorched outside, I managed to duck inside the mine... only to be killed instantly by the dozen of lvl 68 Scorched clustered inside the door. 
---
I didn't bother coming back until I'd reached lvl 70. 
---
I don't think that the quests should lead you into areas that you are so very underlevelled for. That's not even a challenge, it's just stupid. 
---
That's a 50th level quest.  I had a friend shepherd me through it earlier, but couldn't use the reward power armor until 50.  Just do whatever you like until 50.
---
Because it takes away any player *and* any character agency. A story without interaction is an absolute crime in the most story interactive storytelling medium out there. Also a story that is in universe a foregone conclusion is pretty uncompelling to say the least. Not only that, but in my opinion you're never given a solid reason to invest in the human drama, you know absolutely none of these people so why should you go out looking for them? Especially after Bethesda confirmed you won't be able to find any living people in the waste.
---
oh, yeah.
---
My cave base is nuke proof I haven't dropped one on myself but I'd let someone test it on Xbox.
---
Just tired of the game.
---
Does someone screaming at you to be better while you're in an extended moment of crisis really work to make you improve yourself? Does your disappointment truly entitle you to belittle like that? It's not enough that we walk a righteous path, but we have to make sure that we walk it with an understanding of our direction and purpose: would it really help you to have someone screaming at you to be better after you know that you've failed?
---
Bethesda gave us an unfinished game, they're demonstrating manipulative tactics and strategies that seem like nothing but fear and desperation: and they're paying for it. If you're really upset there are class action lawsuit starting to spring up (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/story/fallout-76-possible-lawsuit/amp). Don't let your own anger belittle you
---
Issue with that is then people stash millions of good guns and armor then no one trades :(
---
Things like ammo crafting and armor/ weapon repairs need to be improved to be more efficient forsure.
---
However i honestly feel pretty pretty op stacking perks like blocker, dodgy, and suppressor while being in power armor. Add in a vampiric weapon, and now the game has been robbed of any real threat.
---
So i think getting rid of the grind is something we should be pushing for, but i can understand why they are trying to raise the difficulty of the game
---
Thank you so, so much for posting this
---
Buy the .38 reciever from a vendor and just mod a hunting rifle ur lv mutants in summersville drop them they are lv 5 mutants for low lv hunting rifle
---
sure,...kill crafting ammo hoarding.  what a great idea.  
---
 The screech attacks do zip. They are annoying its true.
---
 The game is working for me but I'm not playing it 12 hours a day. I tend to burn out if I do that, so I don't.

Another one is in one of the homes just North of the Order of Mysteries base.

&gt;he's my everything...

We call that the tea party... yes it's a problem... no, there's nothing you can do about it.
---
If you've got more than 2-3 people in a tea party, just stop wasting ammo and condition and leave.
---
If you're bitter about it, wait till the event is over, follow them to their camps, and smash them.
---
Praise you! 
---
You are a fantastic voice actor! I love this and would love to hear other players Survivor Stories. 
---
Side note, if you don't already you should totally pursue voice acting! This would be great for a demo reel.
---
This subreddit is more entertaining for me than the game at this point - and more interactive too
---
rad suit is a completely different matter altogether, though.
---
I remember people saying bobblehead-related perks were busted and you could essentially have them on forever. so maybe they fixed the stacking but not the perks.
---
Yeah, the part about soloing the silo was a red herring. And as for no one showing up, it's sad but true these days. I probably should have said it's just extremely unlikely that anyone soloed the queen. Is that even possible? 
---
We are talking about asking mods to remove a swastika from a game. Is that something that nobody should take action on? Do you hear yourself? 
---
You must be a bethesda employee if you think melee needs to be nerfed.  Jesus man, let us have the one thing that is still fun and effective.  You can't just nerf everything into the ground.  I suppose you could, but it would make for one terribly boring game.  
---
The day bethesda nerfs melee is the day I uninstall this game for good.
---
Unless I totally misread my initial playthrough, the responders, free states and the brotherhood were all allied, at least at some point.  It seems that the free states came to the aid of the helpless citizens of Harper's Ferry and Berkeley Springs, as they were preppers with skills and resources, and allied with the Responders after the two groups made contact.  The Brotherhood was friendly with both factions, but put strain on the relationship with their demand for resources in their failed effort to stop the Scorched plague.
---
The Raider clans were the only group that were in it for themselves, and it seems like they were the first to crumble, having to deal with wasteland dangers and being surrounded from both the east and west by an allied coalition.
---
The other factions, such as the order of mysteries and the enclave were semi-neutral.  They looked out of their own interests and were neither friend or enemy to the responders/free-states/brotherhood.  I think if they didn't crumble from within, the Order of Mysteries would have allied with the responders.  They were clearly an enemy of the raiders, and if you read the terminal entries, there's a suggestion that they were likely to initiate communication with the Responders.
---
Haha havent quite got to that level of evilness yet. Maybe I should....
---
I'd like to see a group of 6-10 players all decked out in crazy costumes, but each member must have a peice if chameleon armor so they can stealth into the scene, to welcome to new players into the world.
---
There is a fissure on the road between the mansion and the whitesprings. 
---
You can take a scorchbeast at level 30. My first SB kill was with my level 5 summerset special, a level 15 zealot's ski sword and my level 25 excavator PA. i was level 26 or 27. It took a few stimpaks and some time but i did it. 
---
Still need calibrated shocks tho and cant find plans for them any bloody where
---
So bugged it's actually useful - lol.
---
Low base damage is still low base damage. Armor penetration just means you're doing more of that low base damage, it doesn't add any additional damage. 
---
Not only it isn't complete, these are only the power armor related bugs. 
---
Prison to the left of grafton dam/grafton town/Grafton dam/grafton steel yard/Huntersville/west Tec. Super mutants give decent xp
---
Golf course while nuked. Ghouls still give good xp
---
The small purifiers seem designed to be really flexible since many bases aren’t near water. That flexibility though can allow some unrealistic scenarios. It should probably only be allowed to be placed on bare ground. 
---
I want it, and with a Scorchbeast hide saddle!
---
I'm sure. Just throwing up my experience to possibly explain it. The last two times I played I got the damage glitch with max perk setup hitting her in the head and didn't get any damage indication other than hit marker. With my setup I can one or two shot level 60 Scorchbeast its just when I fight Queen I run into no damage issues.
---
What makes you think any of this? What content have they "easily" patched in? 
---
Some one dropped one on the ground after i helped them out at whitesprings. 
---
well, like i said, Beth is stupid and they think they need to balance this game to be like other games, whey infact if i can level up really fast that just encourages me to make multiple characters and infact it encourages me to delete my characters and level them up again. (if plans were account wide this would be a thing)
---
Here we see the troll nobody will ever love in the wild.
---
The amount of work that goes into making a DLC like Far Harbor or Nuka-World requires a considerably sized team as  well as hours.  Judging by what this game was intended to be it is highly doubtful they would invest in something as extensive as the previously mentioned Fallout 4 DLCs.  Fallout 4 was one of the top rated games when it came out IIRC, compared to FO76 which has done relatively poorly in contrast.  In all likelihood this game will get a little bit of love but we should be practical in our expectations.    
---
Of course though, I hope I am wrong and they release something that really blows us away.
---
Good bot. 
---
I think he was saying you could always find another straight jacket.
---
It always amazes me YouTubers who have 20 or more explosive guns! I got my 1st explosive at level 111 and now they've been nerfed. 
---
The game has gone back to before there were explosive guns. There have been players just dumping their stuff, especially after the patch. 
---
That may be so, and how it was reported, but it's a little ham-fisted, and they should have disabled the other 2 terminals so it was clear what their function was, or configure them like in other locations, where they become informational and don't report "busy"

Value is a very subjective thing, especially as these are purely cosmetic things. There are people who have paid the equivalent of US$2.3 million for a "lucky" license plate number in Hong Kong.  
---
The better way to answer this question given that those skins have negative value to me (wearing the skin identifies you as one of those P.T. Barnum said was born every minute)  is to pose the questions you might want to consider when determining what the value is to you.  
---
Who is this for: Do you like taking and publishing screenshots? Are you a youtuber/twitch streamer? Do you play with friends? Do you care what a small number of complete strangers thing about you? If you answered "no" to all of those, then the cosmetics with the Tricentennial edition aren't worth anything for you.
---
Durability isn’t inherently a bad feature. But when guns and armor break because the wind got a bit chilly you know there’s a problem lmao
---
ummmm is that rhetorical or a trick question?
---
There's usually one on a shelf in the basement of Mountainside B&amp;B.
---
It's definitely hitting Game Pass
---
honestly i dont see them having a case to ban you.  you didn't glitch the game, pass through a wall etc.  you just joined an event and it dumped you into a map which you explored.  it's their game thats broken, THEIR fault.  
---
For the Lighthouse, run back and forth from the house and the lighthouse. DO NOT go up to deposit until you have 50, just keep tabs on it. Kill toads, run back and forth, and you should have it pretty easy assuming you can 2-3 shot the toads.
---
Noticed that last night. Level 22 moleman took 5 rockets from the missle launcher to kill - OR - 6 shots from my level 20 moded shotgun. 
---
It makes no sense. 
---
On top of that I find myself spending at least and hour or two farming for shotgun shells, BEFORE I actually get to spent the last 30 minutes trying a quest....IF im lucky, before I have to turn off and head to bed.
---
Dont get me wrong, i like farming (to an extent) and building up my supplies, selling them for caps etc.... but its so much of a grind now, that fun part, is not fun any more. The reward you get from it is almost less than the cost of actually doing it in the first place.
---
Awesome question! I too wanted to know a few more things, thanks for the tips and maps guys! I also read a guys post who said once you get to the top of the world don't keep progressing until you level up some more as then it gets really hard. I'm level 31 and some of the places even the divide kick my butt still.
---
You’re right. It was kind’ve of a lazy fix as far as I see
---
What are the drawbacks 
---
At least when you finish the main quest you fill satisfied unlike the Super Bowl, halftime show, and commercials
---
Over-repaired armor gets stronger too.
---
i have had that happen while playing this last weekend. it wasnt just large enemies either, it was all enemies. lost a 3\* legendary or two in WS nuke zone due to it. 1 diassappeared while i was in mid-loot. 
---
This video helped me build my 2x1 stair tower last night:
---
[https://youtu.be/sfb-QT4gp-I](https://youtu.be/sfb-QT4gp-I)
---
yes.... more and more it's reminding me of the DMV, which ironically I forgot was an in game, hellish quest I forgot about until someone reminded me...
---
Well the vaults themselves are there for one. So, they would just add the code, just like they did for that.
---
I get you're trying to make a statement about Bethesda, but this is literally how any content is added to games. Via updates. By easily patched, I am saying that all they need to do is input the code.
---
Making their content work properly is another story, and I am not making a comment about that. My point is that they can add anything overnight via an update and we wouldn't see it until the game is updated.
---
Do you have any 2 or 3* two handed melee?
---
Harpers ferry vendor is the best of them all isnt he lmao that soothing voice though 
---
I thought was patched ? 
---
We need a dungeon with a big scaling boss at the end of it. Nobody wants more normal enemies to fight, it's boring. Add raids or dungeons or something worthwhile. Honestly though the game needs fixing before they had anything. Guessing the devs will pretty much abandon the game before anything worthwhile is added.
---
Blah,blah,blah. Most socialworkers are scumbags. I grew up in the foster care system,so go ahead,tell me I don't know what I'm talking about.
---
Get off your high horse and stop trying to win liberal of the year.....
---
Amen.
---
Casuals
---
I hear ya. Yesterday I was at my camp and saw a player come along as I was going inside to scrap and drop stuff off in the stash. I gave him a wave and he gave a thumbs up. He didnt do anything out of the ordinary. Using my crafting stations and what not. But he was hanging around longer than I was comfortable with. I jumped onto my roof thanks to marsupial, went into sneak w/ chameleon armor so no one could see me up there and waited to see what he was doing for so long. Then I guess one of his friends fast travelled to him because there were two all of a sudden. Whether they were just admiring (from the thumbs up emote) or planning some shit, I just server hopped since I didnt want them to just up and start wrecking my stuff. 
---
Rofl!
---
OMG Colonel Gutsy. I have died SO many times to these fucks. I don't understand what the super high damage comes from. Do they have like uber armor piercing weapons or something?
---
I thought you got like 20 minutes if you get there when the event starts? 4 is really tight.
---
Sadly it won't work since people can server hop
---
There it is.
---
Lol. I appreciate the long response I think I’ll just go with the standard edition. 
---
I don’t suffer from Bone Worms.  I’ve had it so often I kind of enjoy it now. 
---
PvP - What's broken about it?  
---
Server stability - This is a weird one.  Some people get all kinds of disconnects constantly.  Some people get very very few.  I'm in the latter camp.  There's nothing to "fix" there, from my perspective.  But for others, the disconnects are really frequent.  YMMV.
---
Infinite Screech - I don't think I've ever encountered *infinite* screeching from one, but they're certainly annoying as fuck to fight.
---
Infinite loading screens - I think I've had that happen once.
---
Getting stuck in PA - they did pretty much fix that, then the last patch reintroduced the bug.  Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.
---
Mesh glitches - It's Bethesda.  I would not hold my breath.
---
Perk bugs - Fixed some, broke others.  
---
Bounty Halving - Not sure.  I don't PvP.
---
Hope that helps a little!
---
Thanks for this list! We're looking into them.
---
That's what I've been doing. I can one-shot toads, that's not the problem. The problem is that the mob is not big enough (only 2 or 3 toads total and about 5 fireflies. Only fireflies respawn, but not at rate to grant 50 fluids within 4 or 5 minutes).
---
Thanks for info guys, will try to get there earlier next time.
---
Poor chose of words. 
---
No, it needs to be harder as in  - it needs to require more skill and knowledge to overcome challenges like a raid boss or something.  
---
But yes... it also needs to be less tedious. I want to go explore and do some side quests and... wait... dang... I have to go hunt down more lead or springs. Ok... I spent all evening resupplying... I'm good for... 2 hours.  You know what, after playing for awhile, I want to adjust my spec a little and experiment with this or that...  To respec farm the resort for a week. I would like to play... and improve skill and spec... and face a challenge and fail at it a few times and then overcome it.  
---
 I've come to terms with the fact that FO76 is not going to be this. I kind of have fun most of the time. I could be having a lot more fun. 
---
the Durability of the Gatling gun is "fine" generally speaking if you use it sparingly.  
---
If it's your default weapon, it still breaks really quickly compared to (previous) rifle durability or melee weapons...  
---
and FFS don't shout nerf melee again, ranged should be buffed, not melee nerfed
---
Here are two other threads I found by searching "respec":
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al9cm4/bgs_you_changed_how_the_most_popular_weapons/
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0vjy/bethesda_when_you_make_huge_changes_in_the_way/
---
Can you not collect the fluid when not in the event? I never actually tried to thats why Im asking. 
---
Grammar nazi here/\/\
---
Ughhhh don't remind me.... Over 4 hours yesterday just for PA.
---
To each their own I guess. I would have preferred living NPCs, and hope they add some in later.
---
I'd say ff14 but that's an MMO so ya know, they live or die on endgame content so kinda neccesary for them
---
Yes..... I've got a few hundred more to post, broken down by "type"
---
If you aren't wearing PA and you like normal armor the rapid-fire screech breaks body armor in only a couple of scorchedbeast fights. Thata why it's so broken to me.
---
Not going to lie, I don't understand it..
---
I will check when I'm able to get I. I'm pretty sure I do. I will let you know. 
---
Okay, same spot as its one of those areas that repopulate mini events. Super mutants @ 65 were attacking a 95 death claw. 1 plasma grenade cripples and kills a couple. Second grenade finishes them off. Maybe a 3rd grenade was thrown for the matriarch death claw, but overall everything was annihilated. 
---
Now you're gonna say, 95 matriarch deathclaw? That thing dies in a sneeze what about... it doesn't matter. Grenades are still viable and with demolition expert (+60% additional damage) maybe you would have only needed one well placed grenade instead of my 3. It's not broken, useless, it's just been toned back to fit in line with other damage dealing perks. 
---
you mean X01? because calib shock plans are available at watoga. Shame they used to cost 480 for the mod.
---
I have a very strong sneak attack stealth sniper build can 1 shot lv 68 mutants anywhere i hit em they just explode sometimes lol i use a instigating hunting rifle with 144 dmg and a instigating explosive lever action with 204 dmg for overkill mister sandman increases crit damage by 50% and eagle eye mutation another 25% plus covert op and a critical reciever escape artist sneaklv3 adrenaline gun fu and all ur rifle cards maxed is fun try it out also farm for a chameleon gear piece so u can be invisible while not moving.
---
So.....  
---
Stays as a "bug" or falls under the "Suggestion" subcategory when I get around to it&gt;?
---
The Restrictions on Camps is retarted anyways. We should be able to stack and we should be able to place foundations as tall as we want as long as it still touches the ground. yet they have the ground point on foundations so high up you can't get them very high.
---
 It's not what I expected but 10/10 
---
But you're a social worker,dedicated to love and compassion..... My ass. Piss off little boy....
---
I don't. They annoy me. Their already being dead just saves me the trouble.
---
I lobbed my only two MIRV nukes at a level 35 red eyed Mothman. It was crouched and therefore wasn’t active I suppose.  Zero damage. Then flew away. 
---
I havent tried it before I gave up on the game but I always had the idea of trying to jetpack up to the sbq.
---
QoL? It’s more inconvenient than anything else, right?
---
They're either going to quit or start griefing. Have run into some serious griefers lately. One is even following me across servers, or was until I blocked him. But I didn't get a chance to block one of his buddies so I suspect that that buddy will be on the look out for me. It's kind of really shitty because now my friends are scared to play with me as I have these griefers looking all over for me. That shit is becoming more frequent as people get seriously bored
---
I'm not a liberal bro I'm a leftist, there's a difference. 
---
I'm sorry you were in the foster system. It's a horrible broken system that often takes children from families of color or poor families and gives their children to rich white assholes that erase their cultural heritage and replace it with evangelical christianity. I work in the foster system. I'm a foster parent. I work to advocate for a complete dismantling of the foster care system. I don't do this to feel good about myself, I do it because I fell in love with some fabulous human beings that showed me just how fucked up the system is. They were young adults (former foster youth) I was working with that motivated me to work with younger foster youth. I deal with those scumbags every day dude, and you're right, most social workers are scumbags who just want to feel better about themselves and satisfy their savior complex.  
---
All that aside. I'm simply saying that little things can trigger folks into shit like suicide, so stuff like this is more serious than your average 20 something edgy white dude would have you believe.
---
To collect Instigating Swing Speed 3 Star melee weapons. I have Four, and I need more.
---
I’ve already collected a whole set of super good 2* heavy combat armor, and all the camp, clothes and other cool things I need. Sometimes, I drop off some TSE weapons and stuff to lower leveled players.
---
Well, I can make BOS also and Dense, so I guess I am crafting today. Thanks. 
---
That’s what I did. And the T60 legs dont wear much faster than the rest.
---
You can absolutely solo the queen. Very doable.
---
you will be cursed for trying to kill the great Mothman
---
I’ve been thinking of trying ESO. What would you recommend for someone just testythe waters?
---
Is that right? Just with a crazy melee build or something? 
---
I think it degrades like food. 
---
Agreed I love the Enclave bunker and siding with them I just blasted through the main quest not caring for the story but once i joined the Enclave I started listening and reading terminals
---
I figured they were pulling from the air
---
It's not harder, it's grindier, which is not needed for a game of this style or size. It's like they're going for the Korean MMO grindfest; it's not what we want.
---
Yea. I went a different way there. 
---
Yeah I did it a while ago. Just go to where the frogs spawn and you'll be set 
---
He can also hack your turrets
---
The problem with asking this thread is there are A LOT of people who will happily give you their opinion despite NEVER ACTUALLY HAVING PLAYED THE GAME. 
---
Some of them will lie about it, some will admit it, but it's true. 
---
i would recommend heading over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals and getting opinions over there. 
---
but for my two cents: i would recommend it if you like fallout. it's pretty cheap now and i've gotten about 150 hours in all solo. that's  a pretty fair amount of entertainment value in my opinion. 
---
&gt; Because instead of nerfing just TSE, they also nerfed non-legendary explosive weapons (missile launcher, M79, etc.), which were trash to begin with, and are now utterly useless.
---
So.... now for 5 points we get 60% damage? How many points in rifleman perks would I have to invest to get 60% damage?
---
Wait till you realize you can MURDER people in this game!!!
---
Don’t play anymore? Could I get ur weapons or armor? lol 
---
By all means, continue to run around this thread and prove how trash you are dude. Seems like the system not only worked you over it made you into a boot licker too.
---
Not affliliated with them in any way other than playing the games I bought and no one said anything about nerfing into the ground.  I have no problem with melee doing more damage than many ranged weapons, but for me the balance is weighted too heavily towards melee at present and the game is too easy.  For me fun is NOT blowing the heck out of enemies with little to no risk to myself.  If I want to see splatter and only worry about gettign wet I can take a sledge hammer to melons.
---
I've got a 25% faster firing speed gatling gun with a speedy receiver and I run Martial Artist 3.  
---
The gatling gun doesn't break fast. Sorry, no more faster or slower than other 'non broken' weapons, especially considering how fast it fires. It's my primary, and it's not rhetoric. I run in a group of 4 regularly, I do not resort to repairing my gun more than theirs.  
---
*Plasma and Laser, however*, break entirely too fast.
---
And I never said to nerf Melee. Melee is fine.
---
Hi
---
The 200Caps daily Caps is really weird with the new prices.
---
And also Cap stashes seem bugged.
---
They are only 50% containers.
---
They still spawn randomly like capstashes, but are lootable like containers (i dont know if thats by design, i hoped that they would be static spawns like all other containers now) 
---
The other Bugs is with "Searching" them a second time (with the perk).
---
It doesnt work 50-70% of the time, you simply dont get the option to search it.
---
I would appriciate if you could look into those issues!
---
Believe it or not,she's actually easier in some ways solo. The more people that show up,the higher her DR and health go.
---
Melee is the best route to solo her,yes. Guns are doable as well.
---
+Karma
---
I only have 4 STR, and it gets really tedious having to swap 2* pack rat with 1* sturdy frame/travelling pharmacy depending on what I'm carrying.
---
Harder also doesn't mean the enemy's HP is multiplied or just completely regenerates because of some arbitrary distinction like level or "legendary" while player damage is nerfed. 
---
This is more a Fallout 4/76 thing than 76 specifically but also can apply to other games as well (looking at you, Kingdom Hearts and Assassins Creed Origins/Odyssey)... 
---
Like the clumsiness of their controls or not, I have to give Rockstar Games credit that in the case of GTA and Red Dead, any given NPC at any point in the game can be taken down by one fairly aimed headshot.
---
PC or Console?  
---
Disconnect or Blue Screen?  
---
Power Armor with Targeting HUD or?  
---
If Yes to the last...  
---
[\[Bug Fix\] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/)
---
So.....who puts it on the Deathclaw?....
---
The Enclave recruit that drew the short straw?
---
TIL. Thank you! 
---
Or nerfing the explosive legendary to +20% from +100% was more than enough without kicking people in the balls with the perk nerf. 
---
Try an get a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet, iron fist, barbarian, and blocker, nerd rage , and unyielding armour (if shes outside the blastzone) a unarmed bobblehead and just try an crouch behind her getting those sneak attacks, have talons mutation and twisted muscles and she should go down with about 15 - 30 hits i've been doing exactly that lately and it seems to work just fine, i've used a bobblehead once for added effects but i don't think its essential. 
---
There are ways to do this with a axe or supersledge you will just need the slugger perks instead of iron fist.
---
I may be missing out a few things here but that is basically what i do i haven't lost a battle with her for a while now. So i hope this helps in some way but whatever your option is i wish you good luck!
---
Shotgun perks fit decently with a melee build. Enforcer perk in agility lets you cripple wings with a shotty, then melee it to death when it lands. Enforcer is life changing to kill regular SB's. For Queens... not so much.
---
I always wanted to put armor on the death claws I captured in fallout 4. That would have been so sweet.
---
No thanks
---
yep, sounds like they are just duper-hunting
---
&gt;*Am I just playing the entire game wrong??* 
---
Kind of.  There's a very specific build that makes most of these pain points go away:
---
The **sledgehammer ninja!**
---
I.e. a **melee,** mostly **unarmored** character with **lots of mutations** that give you armor and let you move fast and jump around.
---
Not wearing armor means you're easier to kill, but I think this makes the game more fun.  Mutations give you enough armor to get by.  Most fights are too easy when you get past lvl 50, so this keeps it interesting - you have to dodge, heal, take cover.  And if you accidentally get killed you only drop your junk...95% of the time you can just pick it up.
---
I wear the hooded robes, which I think is the coolest outfit in the game - but you can't wear any armor with it.  I actually really like that dynamic, it's like a badge of honor.
---
Just carry a power armor chassis with you, and get into power armor if you get into a tough fight or want to go into a nuked zone.  You get the benefit of not having to lug around a bunch of armor that does nothing while you're wearing power armor.
---
Melee is OP at this point (I can one hit most things.  If you get an "instigating" 2 handed melee weapon, even better) and not having to deal with ammo is great.  Get the perk that reduces melee weapon weight and you can carry around a pile of sledgehammers and always have a fresh one.
---
Mutations are key to quality of life, and just lots of fun:
---
**Grounded + Scaley Skin** = huge natural armor boost without having to deal with repairing armor
---
**Marsupial** \+ **Speed Demon** = more carry weight, better jumping (much easier to get around cities, cliffs), and you move 20% faster 
---
**Carnivore =** you can eat meat without cooking it, and it fills way more hunger.  You can carry less food, and if you run out just kill something and eat it.
---
**Healing Factor =** rapid heal out of battle, so you can carry fewer stim packs.  Managing chems sucks.
---
There's also an endurance perk that heals your radiation over time during the day - I always have that on.
---
I have some sneaky perks too, but more for fun than actual usefulness.  This build is all about blitzing your target and squishing it before it can get too many hits in.  Jumping off of roofs onto enemies is fun too.  There's an agility perk that gives you a damage boost for 30 seconds when you kill an enemy too -&gt; sledgehammer rampage?
---
All that said, I really wish guns were better in this game, or ammo was more manageable.  I'd prefer to do a shooty build.  But that said, this is the most stress-free / build I've found given the current meta.
---
Also - for dealing with scorched beasts:  Just kill all the scorched that they spawn, and most of the time they will land.  You do so much damage with melee, you can kill them before they take off again.
---
And power drills
---
Now that you mention it, I do recall being called a Commie and having my splinter blown off.
---
Is there something you want to tell us?
---
lmao at superman raping invisible man.
---
I tried this back in November shortly after launch around level 10. I had about 15 min on the timer but the creatures wouldn't respawn fast enough for me. I only got to 48 by the time the timer ran out. Ended up with 3 broken weapons and some broken armor from the toads. Was so discouraged afterwards that it was a while before I tried to do another event solo.
---
Oh please, 'everything' wasn't changed.  You can respec your PERKS at ANY TIME.  Just swap them out.  The SPECIALs are a bit more complicated, but you can still change them out each time you level which isn't that difficult.  
---
Why don't you just ask for a 'win' button for everything in the game while you're at it.
---
its a rare random encounter, why should it not have a rare reward?
---
I would love this. The faction system from New Vegas, while surprisingly simple, was one of my favorite parts of the game. I think it would be a great addition here
---
Would it surprise you?
---
Is the range on a shotty good enough to hit a flying sb? 
---
I haven’t played in 6 days. Really don’t know if I will ever play this game again.
---
I was level 28 the last time I logged out. I had just bought a level 45 TSE shotgun for 1000 caps from someone online. Now it’s useless. That is the straw that broke camels back. I was already fed up with all the glitches and bugs.
---
My weapons and armor were already broken but now with out white knight and explosive weapons they’re going to require even more maintenance.
---
Oh yeah the first time I battled the scorchbeast queen I couldn’t loot the body because the game was lagging so hard all I got was the spinning load animation until the body despawned. That really pissed me off.
---
All my friends have quit. What is there
---
because balance is the player's fault?
---
I'm done. L142, past couple of weeks I've been making level 1 armor and weapons to give to new arrivals. Still hoping for new content at some point, but right now I'm just bored. 
---
LoL. Keep trolling. Social worker for 12 years huh? So assuming at least 2 years for college that would make you supposedly at least 32. 
---
So why do you talk like a 18 year old?
---
I will ABSOLUTELY comment wherever I feel and when. That being said,you're the one 'running around the  thread'.
---
Social workers are society's losers like high school gym teachers.
---
About lvl 30 I did a mission called Miner Miracle. Look it up for detail. The reward among many was Excavator Power Armor plans. It requires a lot of springs but the base material is black titanium. Turns out the Mole Miners suits are made of it and a workshop near vault 76 has some. This armor lasts a long time and allows +100 carry.  As for guns I like the sniper non automatic rifles that use .308 and .45. As for ammo I had the same prob till I tagged lead. It is everywhere. 
---
It already is faceroll easy.
---
No for the ultracite PA. Although I didn't realise Watoga had x-01 mods. Thought it was just t45 t51b and t60 mods. Still need x-01 mods too so will check later 👍
---
 I have BOS Heavy Combat and her screech don't do shit to me. Now rads can be a problem and we all have to run from the gas but I, with a little late help killed 3 level 80 Scrochebeasts at The Whitespring Service Entrance yesterday. My guy is level 52 now. 
---
Thanks. Is camp building a big mandatory part of the game? 
---
I think it's reasonable to assume the developers would increase survival hardships as you get better at the game, not hit you with those hindering game systems hard up front and then give you more tools to deal with them later. Just asking for a bit of advice is all.
---
I'd eradicate the entire population of deathclaws to craft this.
---
This means war
---
How would you do power attacks then?
---
Me 
---
You can read about it in one of the Free States terminals in Harpers Ferry I think
---
the Vault was like "hey guys we have all this free stuff to help you" and some Free States dickheads did something in the Vault causing it/Strangleroot/the Mire it's heavly implied to be a G.E.C.K. that's already been activated.
---
Imagine if using this makes you play like a Deathclaw (you can only use melee punches but those melee punches are Deathclaw Gauntlets built into the suit, you have a boatload of resistance and sprinting is 3x faster but you can't jump more than a few feet even with Marsupial)
---
Because we should be only allowed non-floating, immersive structures, like [this one](https://i.imgur.com/mfTq8FT.jpg)!
---
I was up on top of the world yesterday!  
---
I wonder, if you place down a power armour frame, if you could leap off of it and get \*all\* the way up top.  
---
SCIENCE THAT!
---
Good tips all around. I have a very strong 2H melee build, with appropriate mutations/armor/perks all min/maxed to death. I contribute significantly when she lands, so I am looking for a way to do ranged damage that matters. Got any tips for when she's in the air?
---
LoL. Preface what is clearly an leftist,liberal statement with 'I'm no liberal bro'.
---
YOU are today's Nazi my friend.
---
I like those enemies.
---
Supermutant Behemoths too. 
---
Melee isn't overpowered so much as every enemy is underpowered - there's no fucking risk to actually punching something.
---
But those behemoths can two hit you, or one hit if you don't have enough armour. 
---
They are so much tougher than the Scorched.
---
WTB Scorched Behemoth events
---
You could potentially make an unraidable base with this. Neat!
---
PS4. Just hit Level 58. No perc card, no special point.  
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
I was kind of hoping the armor would be made from Death Claws, but thus us far more terrifying.
---
It's certainly not easy, but I was able to collect 50 fluids in time.  My build does revolve around speed though so I move around pretty quick.
---
If I hadnt already uninstalled it I totally would sorry mate.
---
In that case, there's this settlement &lt;ducks&gt;
---
Anytime!
---
It would still be mapped to two different keys and when you're ready to stop swinging your regular just let go then you could power attack. 
---
Similar to how the chainsaw type weapons do. 
---
It's already being given away free at some stores with purchase
---
Agree with this.  With a maxed and well-thought-out build, nothing about this game should be terribly hard, even going solo through just about anything except for the SBQ.  If something is too hard for you at level 30, do something different and it will be easier when you revisit it in a few levels.  
---
Yes, I do think nerfs are discouraging, but only becuase of the lost time and effort, not because it makes the game hard.
---
When they dip close, yes, as long as you don't have mods that cut the range down.
---
  Concentrated fire perk combo with enforcer makes regular SB's almost easy. Cripple the head with the shotgun when they land so they just sit there and grunt for a while without fighting back, and switch to melee. The crippling does wear off after a bit, so don't waste time or you have to rinse and repeat if it takes off again.
---
2 reasons people don’t bother with the whole process: 
---
1) the silo is a chore. Robots are the tankiest ass things, and eat bullets, melee swings, and everything in between, the times for silos went from about 15-20 mins to like 30-45, which isn’t time people want to put in if they knew they could do it much faster and efficiently earlier.

2) the SBQ, Whitesprings, Monongah, and VTU are a chore and a waste of time. People nuke for 2 things, Xp, and legendary items. The legendary loot system is such a HILARIOUS JOKE, and people feel it, it’s not worth the time. Once you hit about level 80, levels are completely irrelevant, and the people with nuke launching capabilities right now are only concerned with getting items, which they don’t get if they nuke. It’s a vicious cycle.
---
So yea, nobody will help you, because they will be reminded of this whole grindy process, and just lose bullets and durability they could save otherwise.
---
This could be easily fixed by making SBQ loot good or giving incentive to level once your build is complete, but we all know that BGSA has no ability to make content or even fix some of the broken fundamental aspects of the game.
---
\*scribbles furiously, nodding\*
---
You are completely over exaggerating. I played for 6 hours saturday. Didnt repair armor, didnt repair power armor, did repair 1 weapon. Didnt cost much so who cares. Did 2 queens and 2 whitesprings nukes. Drop were awesome, rhye seem to have upped the rate of good armor drops. 
---
We need a anti whining sub for fallout. 
---
Did you play Division 1? That’s whAt was said about it until it came out and it was a mess.
---
This 100%. What drives me nuts is that the game isn't hard at all. It's actually pretty easy. But it's tedious as fuck. Fighting a scortchbeast isn't hard. I don't worry I might not win. i just worry it might take me 25 minutes to win with it's health pool and never landing. I worry I will have to repair everything so the next 3 hours of my life will be spent finding the scrap I need to get back to the point I was at before a scortchbeast shows up. It's not hard, it's just an unfun grind. 
---
Yeah its constant grind. I love the game and want the best for it but I cant even play the class I want because I'm constantly out of ammo. I've waisted so many perks into armor durability reduction and weapon reduction because it was a hassle to constantly repair stuff. I even did increase ammo production but it still doesnt help. 200 rounds is useless. Is like 10 enemies unless I sneak kill with damage bonus. So I'm constantly using melee weapons because it's easier to maintain. And they do alot of damage. Sometimes I just afk at the ammunition factory so I cant get some ammo and enjoy running around for 30 mins 
---
I had forgotten about cave bases! The only location I know of is near Vault 76 though and I don't think it can be the target of a nuke? 
---
I'm currently hunkered down outside Pleasant Valley Station (near the junk pile) and learned the hard way that my barnyard walls, though colorful and cheery, are no match for a nuclear strike.  Hell... they aren't even that good during a Rad storm.
---
Every time I get this message, I say "I wouldn't necessarily say I'm 'suffering' from them..."
---
Nice set of gum bumpers bet you can swallow the Meat and Toto's
---
No, I'm pretty sure same named bonus overrides the previous one, even if it is a smaller bonus. So if you eat a str +2, and then turn around and eat a str +1, you have +1 strength.
---
And there it is. I hope someday the trauma from your past eats you alive and you find yourself wishing for a.nicer works while you finally jump off that bridge. Fucking trash human.
---
Show some love to the guy who made this he deserves it I just posted it
---
Small stash limit killed my brother
---
funny you bring this up. i have been rocking my lvl 45 excavator power armor for a long time waiting to get Calibrated shocks for my x01. I came across a couple SC for T60 so decided to farm up a set of that instead. i got my new set all up and repaired and modded yesterday, put it on and seem to be much less durable than i was in my Excavator set... go figure
---
not necessarily.  alien blaster in fo4 was unique , only one in game PERIOD.  it sucks, people get it anyhow because its cool.  rare doesn't = awesome.  i see flatwood monster as an easter egg, its not a miniboss hence you didnt really earn an awesome loot.
---
Power plant 👀 
---
Having downsides is not the same as being unviable for me. Ranged weapons have to worry about ammo for example.
---
But damage wise there is too much disparity between weapon types, and while i don't think every weapon should be good in endgame content, which we have very little, at least few from a perk class have to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. 
---
I actually had the opposite experience: At first I kind of glossed over them and didn't pay them much mind, but as I realized that there was loads of interesting storytelling taking place through these devices, I began to pay more and more attention to them and became more and more engrossed at the tapestry of stories contained within. 
---
You guys realize there is an incredible single player mode right? Also, online is in beta. Additionally, you're not seriously suggesting Fallout 76 is superior to Red Dead are you? I mean I still play it a bit and want it to succeed but it's not better. Lastly, the atoms store and the gold bars store are nearly identical in how they're set up from what I've seen. Fuck both of them honestly.
---
Yes! And associated half roofs.
---
You CAN and HAVE to pick and choose what parts of realism you want in a video game tho.
---
But I do agree, the cap limit is too low. I never argued that. 
---
Funny you mention ESO as I've recently picked it back up again after barely playing it before. And I'm glad I did, I'm loving having the vast multitude of quests being dropped in my lap
---
I went to look for the head. It's very well hidden. Also, I'm getting GLaDOS vibes from MODUS \^\^
---
Ahh, the ol' 20 minute video to show something that takes about 20 seconds.
---
Technically it dropped you nothing. The harpoons are from someone elses harpoon gun's fletchettte mod.
---
Careful, down vote's on the horizon. You can't speak positivity about Bethesda here. I tried a few times. Have my measly up vote, keep fighting the good fight.
---
But it takes away 4x your ammo. Lol
---
Yeah I played that game for years. The division 1 was a mess at the beginning yes, I agree. They fixed everything eventually but it took them years in total. Despite that it still has some of the most detailed builds in any game I’ve ever played, RPGs included. You can spend hundreds of hours just putting together different builds. The nodding and perk system is like 300 times deeper  than anything in fallout 76
---
Thanks for including the Map by Level. No wonder I was playing scared in the Mire and Cranberry bog. I can see now that I have been playing in areas that are WAY above my pay grade. Ha. I need to spend some quality time in the forest and Toxic valley. 
---
Why wpukd the gun be useless. It is still more poweful than a normal gun. It is still the best u can get. Only now you have to fire 3 shots to kill a level 68 instead of 1. Woopeee dooooodaaaa. Wtf. So sick of people over exaggerating on here. 
---
Yes. I think they appreciate feedback and suggestions. That's why I posted this. Im on the side of making the game the best it can be. Thanks for your input! 
---
I got 6! 
---
I don't like repairing in any game. I have 9 points in repair-avoidance perks (3 White Knight, 3 Lucky Break, 3 Luck of the Draw) and I still have to repair both weapons and armor each day, though I am at a point where I find more ballistic fiber than I use. Needing 2 fiber a day at level 80 is a lot better than needing 8-12 at level 30.
---
At least they ought to push the ballistic fiber requirement up to level 45-50 armor. Players are unlikely to have White Knight x3 before then, and mid-level armor costs more to repair than the armor's actually worth.
---
My suspicion is that they see people server-hopping to farm ballistic fiber, and they decided that now we have too much. Instead of combating server-hopping, their response is to raise the requirements of the mat being over-farmed, making server-hopping almost necessary. Tackling the problem from the wrong end amplifies the problem they wanted to solve.
---
End-game melee is really strong on the other hand, and there's a lot of options to make it a lot stronger. My main weapon's a walking cane, but I'll need to downgrade to a rolling pin or something to stop one-hitting everything before others can tag them. I'm not low-health, just 15 strength + twisted muscles. There's no reason for players to carry 6lb mini nukes when I can just wave my 0.24lb stick and everything dies.
---
Sometimes to gain knowledge you have to kill some followers.  
---
Discovery requires experimentation.

Ahahhaahhaa

Bought some Serums from her (Female Character) last night.  Professional.  Neat shop with her behind a counted.  I liked it.  10/10 would buy serums from her again.
---
With this i'm not so sure i just have a pop at her when she in the air with whatever gun i have until she lands, i have taken her out fast with a tse 50 cal after the nerf but its weak af when shes in the air, hard to get a steady aim on her, but hopefully you will be joined with a few players that fire mini nukes an that go in on her till she does land i've been melee built for 200 levels now (bit boring i know lol) so i could help you with almost anything with that 
---
As i say ranged i'm not 100% sure on someone here will have a good tactic for you though.
---
Believe All Players
---
Straight up fuck this game at this point.
---
Walls make more sense than ever in a post-apocalyptic hellscape.
---
I don't know how I did it, but when I did the MM 3 factions ending playthrough in Fo4 I stopped getting quests from Preston (could also be that I used a mod to skip the raiding the commonwealth quest).
---
The game has enough problems, do you really need to post theoretically problems that may (or in most cases may not) exist? Yikes, people.
---
Thank you:) and idrc if I’m downvoted 
---
BRING IT OOON
---
Awesome feedback. Thanks.
---
I'm a leftists, not a liberal, there is a difference. A liberal wouldn't kill you for being hateful, but I would.
---
How dare you speak such words in my post!
---
I'm mostly a melee guy myself. During one of these fights, I whip out my handmade rifle and pelt her wings as much as possible just to get her to land, and the moment she does, I whip out my legendary fireaxe, pop a psychobuff, charge up to her and start power attacking for all I'm worth. Most people can't really harm her substantially while she's in the air. Everyone's job while she is there is to force her to land so they can get in close enough to really lay into her. 
---
I got NOTHING this morning.  The wheel of death just kept turning until the body disappeared.  
---
No, I meant watoga does NOT have X01 mods. I Probably could’ve said that in a clearer way.￼
---
Tell me you don’t have over 600 junk items with a straight face I’ll wait 
---
That’s right you have way more you wouldn’t be able to store any junk
---
For me it’s a timing thing. I thing auto swing while beneficial to some would hinder others. It would literally kill your AP. To me it’s a resource management issue if that makes sense.
---
I use a TSE handmade and a TS lever action 
---
How do I imagine Fallout 76 in the future?
---
In the recycle bin on the desktop, along with the Bethesda Launcher. 
---
Based on what I can remember from the No-Clip documentary, this is what I believe had happened in regards to the development of 76 and how Austin was brought into the mix :
---
I believe that an online mode was initially developed for Fallout 4, but by late 2014-early 2015 they realized they couldn't get this to work like they wanted. At this point they decided to scrap it and only implement the base-building mechanic into FO4 (even at launch I felt that this mechanic felt like it was put together hastily). 
---
They were still interested in getting into the "Game-as-a-Service" model and enlisted the help of the failing Battlecry studios to get them into this space. It is well documented that by October of 2015 (a month before the release of FO4), what had remained of Battlecry, following extensive layoffs, had began working on projects for other studios. I would imagine this is when they began working on what would become Fallout 76.
---
Essentially, Bethesda gave their problematic engine to a failing studio and told em to "Get it done". The rest is history.  
---
Leading explanation I’ve heard is that the group working on Fo76 started before the group working on Fo4 was done. The latter group made significant crafting mechanic changes and it didn’t get channeled to the former group. Not sure if that’s a real story or not, but it sounds like a project management/managerial SNAFU consistent with Bethesda’s actions of late.
---
Social worker huh? More like internet liar and loser. Move outta your mom's basement 'bro'....
---
I use a controller with PC, would be nice if we could map our buttons XD
---
Not if the number was like 10,000.
---
I've quit til its better and I'm very sad about it...
---
I don’t think this is enough to imply trade exploits, if anything it shows Bethesda’s fix to preventing people from seeing your inventory without you joining into a trade session is working.
---
As for what they really were doing, who knows? Some kid who can’t express himself well is most likely what was going on here.
---
fast travel out
---
It’s a 2h with medium speed. Hybrid weapons like this have meh Single damage but very good dps and low ap cost. It’s very good when you have a legendary with 40 percent faster swing speed (as I do)
---
Wha???
---
I don't care about stash limit as much as I'd like a box I could put stuff in for people who visit my base to take stuff from.  Like an open share.  Hey here's a stupid gun I don't want, put in box.  Next guy comes along, oh look a gun I want.  
---
It's much, much easier to do in a group, that's for sure. I think more enemies spawn per player involved, so between that and the sheer fact of having multiple people rounding up the fluid and dropping it off, it's not too challenging. 
---
Man, I can't even move my legit built camp because "oBjEcT nEeDs a SuPpOrt" so we might as well use those fancy techniques.
---
This game is not Skyrim. You should compare Skyrim vs Fallout 4 when it comes to content. That is a closer comparison. This game doesn’t have story mode LMAO. 
---
I find that I don't really want to leave my camp because I just get fucked by cave crickets.
---
Never liked the karma system in the past, but this sounds like an awesome way to introduce it in 76.
---
Yeah I'm a PS4 player personally. 
---
I found somd unyielding armor in the meantime. 3 pieces, but sadly all 1*
---
They want you to buy from players. I'm pretty sure that's another reason they raised cap prices. 
---
The amount of dedication players put into working around this mess is amazing.
---
It's the worst base building implementation I have ever seen, and I thought Conan Exiles did it bad already.
---
Vault 63 is off limits?  I've been in there. 
---
Ok sweet thanks guys!
---
But a mininuke should be OP. It isn't. Especially for the cost of weigh in the weapon, the ammo weight, the reload speed, and the capacity. This specific weapon is simply unbalanced.
---
I think it's funny that I cannot map a PTT button because I use a controller on PC XD
---
You can get Heavy Combat Armor Arms from Harper's Ferry or Watoga on a RNG basis that's not very uncommon. Maybe about six visits and you should find them. All the Sturdy and Heavy Combat armor plans seem to be RNG to appear (1 at a time) on the vendors on the East side of the map. This is one of the few plans that's not a guaranteed drop, but still RNG-based.
---
But, regular swings don't drain AP? Are you referring to power attacks? 
---
Wow this looks fun, must mean it will get hotfixed.
---
No prob's.
---
FYI If there is a high level player in the area the NPCS will scale to them, so if you're having issues check the map and if need be server hop till the area is clear, although don't be worried about attacking NPCS higher level than you. Sometimes with a little kiting / thinking it through they still go down quicker than than a cheap whore.
---
lol you took a snapshot of taking a snapshot. META!
---
PTT? 
---
Yep, I just like to have control of what I’m doing, and how it’s being done if that makes sense
---
Have fun in BDO.
---
Nice way to farm junk from players...devilish. 
---
Call in an airdrop and bait it. Super cheesy, but it’s easy junk.
---
I like how you see the pictures every day of awesome camps but still decide to spread salt instead.
---
The last thing we need is more nerfs right now. Ranged weapons just need some serious damage buffs.
---
I hope they don't do the stupid respawning robot security wave shit. Most other MMOs with dungeon like stuff the enemies don't keep respawning cycle after cycle once you clear a zone. The game gives you time to collect yourself. FFXIV for example
---
All signs lead to them being raid dungeons. 
---
For 500 caps from player
---
I personally have not had a problem with stealth. I just played last night. 
---
I have noticed that the "meter".... hidden/caution/danger... is a little slower to react, maybe a tiny bit more sensitive. There was an evening that I had a bit of trouble landing from a fast travel directly into caution.  But it resolved itself. 
---
I've noticed that I have to slow down a bit, instead of relying on crouch to save the day. Stealth is less forgiving now... but I would not say it's "broken" or "bugged". 
---
This is my experience, and it's very consistent. Sneak sniper is my only play style. 
---
Your parents failed you, the state failed you, and now your just another shitty mother fucker in the world failing everyone around you by being an uncaring asshole. You are worth less then shit on my shoe bro.
---
They eventually fixed the things wrong with Division but that’s the problem with games these days. They release some broken half effort low content game for $60 and fix everything later.
---
By the time everything was fixed, the player base had left. Oh yeah and they added in a bunch of micro transactions 🙄
---
push to talk
---
I'd like to get more details on how you got this to work. Are you able to have your two characters from the same account in game at the same time? Sandboxie gives me "file to large errors". I need to read more how to use it. 
---
The nerf was to 2 shot and explosive. You shouldn't be experiencing accuracy issues. Also they added a bug with rad worms messing up mutations.
---
I gave you updoot. It is a good game. It is a game where you get out of it what you put into it. If you grind towards leveling then it is going to feel like a grind. If you blow through content then it is going to seem weak on content. If you buy duped eBay guns for a simulated god mode then you are going to be pissed when they nerf your gun and you have to play the game as intended.
---
If you like exploring, role playing, and experiencing a multi-player Fallout game at a reasonable pace then you will likely have a hood experience
---
How dare you not be able to put a FOUNDATION on a FOUNDATION.
---
Jesus Christ, the things that rustle jimmies.
---
Scorchbeasts have 3 modes. The hover shooting donut mode, crop dusting mode and landing mode. If you as a melee get its attention by trying to go underneath it will move to another mode. You can tell when it wants to land when it circles around and flies higher into the air.
---
Disclaimer: sometime they will bug in mode 1, hover and shooting donut mode. theres nothing you can do about that.
---
Why do you need plan but not just serum?
---
Yeah I getcha, maybe make it a toggle then in the settings? Or have it not include power attacks? 
---
I wouldn’t say it’s a super integral part of the experience but it’s nice to have a place to escape and scrap everything. It’s nice having all the crafting stations in one place but obviously you can find crafting stations scattered throughout Appalachia. I think with early levels, you just have to be cautious about where you explore a bit. If you have high level players around you, it’s going to spawn higher level enemies so just be careful. Survival hardships happen a bit in later levels, and I think it just depends on how you play. Some people hoard water and food. Some people eat people. Some only have what they’ll need and forage to fill in. I just think starting off it does get a bit frustrating, you sort of have to find a groove that keeps you alive, without like you said, making it the only thing you end up doing. 
---
No you're still missing the point. When someone says "there's no story" they're using *exaggeration*.
---
Exaggerating is when you take a statement that's moderate and extremize it to better state your point. It's not to be taken literally.
---
When people say "there's no story". They're actually saying "there's barely a story and the part that are there are ***terrible***. I explained most of this in my first comment. 
---
this is a great inventory management simulator
---
Social worker that is worried some guy in a video game may cause someone to commit suicide by building a symbol,but yet is encouraging me to go kill myself?
---
Hmmmmm......
---
I think you just outed yourself as a liar and COMPLETELY full of shit..
---
You just validated everything I said about you and socialworkers in general.
---
Told you I was right. 
---
Experience ftw... 
---
That is very useful information. I didn't think there were strats to get it to land faster.
---
Ahh, yeah. That thing PC users get. 
---
I think their vision was Atoms. The only thing in game that looks and works perfectly really.
---
Everything besides that was an after thought :(
---
At this present time, they don't seem to have or take any pride in their product, which for me speak's volumes :/
---
Suddenly picturing the First Citizen of Vault-City going "..and ghouls are gonna pay for it!".
---
They only hold X amount of weight I believe at a time. The most you can hold with the top purifier is up to 6 I believe.
---
Yea see I can get behind that. Also I wish there was a way to set the screen border on consoles.
---
You have that backwards.  Uninstall the game and play using only the mods.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I agree
---
It’s a glitch 
---
None of that stuff would work in an online game. The first player to come out of the vault would nuke the town and kill every killable npc, and either nobody else would ever see those characters, or they would have to make those npcs instanced for each character, or just respawn whenever they get killed. Do you really think either of those would be better, more immersive, more compelling storytelling?
---
The strength perk, Ordinance Express, will reduce the carry weights of grenades, 40mm grenades, missiles, and mini nukes.
---
Got my last achievement last night (kill 20 players) and I think i'm probably on the road to done. I really only stay to talk with a couple friends I met while playing. All I do now is log in, see if there is any good events, and bullshit with friends/help them. I am bored to tears at this point. Also I want a Furious Lever-Action rifle but I doubt thats ever gonna show up in my drops.
---
??? Just block this other person as well. Why would your friends be scared to play? There's nothing at stake.
---
&gt; Are the enemies really that spongey
---
Kinda, sure maybe not standard ghouls, mole rats, etc. but still even non-crowned non-legendary SM Warlords, Wendigos, Gulpers, etc. are very tanky even with an alright legendary on a decent weapon with most perks but are stupid tanky if you'd tried killing them but with equivalent legendary effects on a low damage weapon like the Minigun. You need to have a great legendary roll just to make those kind of underpowered weapons feel like actual weapons instead of ammo disposal devices. It's not quite as bad with pistols since most of them are fairly high damage/shot even if they're not as good as decent rifles.
---
Tfw I didn't even realize there wasn't because I have a smart TV that does it for me. 
---
i got in here as well on XB1 and i think i actually walked into it because i know i wasn’t doing an event there. i got stuck “stuck” at like level 25-30 in the ash heap with too much to carry that i wasnt willing to drop, and i had like 2 diluted after getting nailed by higher level enemies. i didnt experience any glitches and i was stunned that the only way i got in was from a tiny underground passage. it was cool yet weird.
---
Don't listen to this dipshit. Read how he talked to me above. He's just a poor little basement troll.
---
Big Brain Builders. 
---
I'm a bit of a pack rat, so the increased stash would be better for me, but it would be nice to have the option to put some storage boxes (persistent across servers) down that weren't tied to the stash and could be locked/left open for items that I want to hold on to, but don't necessarily care if they get taken/stolen.
---
I hate the pricks who place their camp behind clubhouse.  I stood by the back door for 40 minutes straight the other night keeping the door closed.  
---
You got your time wasted.  That’s something. 
---
Demolition Expert was reduced because it was the ONLY weapon type specific perk that didn't cap off at a 60% bonus. Explosive weapons taking a hit to their damage doesn't make any other fucking weapon less useful. Explosives are supposed to be used for their splash damage, that is where they excel. If you're trying to take on single enemies with explosives then FUCKING STOP. Bethesda is NEVER going to buff explosives to the point where they're competitive for single target damage. 
---
Has to be 2 different accounts. For example i login my main normally through the launcher then to launch and alt account i run the exe file from the folder the game is installed in witch brings me to a login window on the main menu.
---
Yea mines older lol so the left and right edges are cut off.
---
If they do that I hope they at least have the decency to give everyone who purchased the game a unique perk card under the Strength category called "Donkey Punch - +100% to unarmed critical damage"
---
What's also funny is if you met me in a facility when you were a kid I'd have loved the shit out of you. Oh well, I guess you got the typical foster kids treatment and now that your grown you get to be another shitty person in the world,congrats, you let your trauma crush the part of you that mattered the most, so now all thats left is an uncaring unfeeling husk.
---
That sucks. 
---
XD I'm hoping if you guys ever get it then they will let me finally map it!
---
It hates you less. 
---
Following
---
In my opinion, it’s nothing. I believe Battlecry Studios are still salty that they got bought by Bethesda and Battlecry was taken down.
---
They are managing to fuck up in miraculous ways, and it’s very clear that it’s intentional, or they’re not qualified for basic game design. I’d like to think that it’s the former, and this is some sort of civil disobedience against Bethesda.
---
It’s more of a conspiracy theory, but I’m willing to believe that if the A team was on this game, it would be much better.
---
This is why I stopped playing. I just can’t keep up with it and the limited storage has me regretting ever buying it.
---
I absolutely love playing the game, when I’m able, but they’ve made it so fucking tedious that it’s just not worth my time.
---
If you knew any better, you would know that FO76, is not actually made by Bethesda that made other Fallouts and Elder Scrolls games, but by Bethesda Austin, which was formely called Battlecry studio(google them, their work is not very impressive).
---
So, FO76 is not a Beth game, it's just like ESO. It is made by people who has not done a FO game before. 
---
Todd is a speachman and does not have a power to ruin games.
---
LOL \^\^This\^\^ bloody annoying, have to keep using the map otherwise I end up in some ditch or some other location.
---
Melee should really do more damage than ranged because you're put in more danger to do it. It's just really out of wack right now.
---
One thing I don’t like is that I haven’t got one TSE
---
Oh.  Cool mod. 
---
Imagine how awesome the camps could be if we had the same snapping options as in fo4, or *gasp* even had **clipping** as an option!
---
This makes me scared to see your FO4 save file. I'm just imagining diamond city being completely empty other than the corpses that litter the streets. Lol
---
I’ve been burned by this a few times on PS4.  Bought a game on sale to have it be free the nd t month.  Benefited a few times to though.  Metal Gear, Hitman this month.
---
Hell yeah. If I had the camp budget, I'd totally build a wall around my camp with a locked entry door. Then realize it's useless when some supermutant spawns inside the wall and wrecks shit. 
---
"Duplicate claims" - do the effects stack? Ba-dum ching 
---
Ladydevann.. i am brand new to the game (started this weekend) despite a lot of bad press this game has gotten. However, i am enjoying it quite a bit. That being said, is there ANY WAY to get a roadmap of what changes the devs are working on? 
---
I feel, for the sake of PR, doing something like a road-map and keeping it fresh and constantly updated would help a friggin TON. 
---
Nothing. 
---
Played a while. Dealt with bugs. 
---
Played a while. Completed most of the main questline.
---
Played a while. Got tired of disconnecting every time I got close to finishing something.
---
Played a while. Bethesda fucked up again.
---
Haven't played in a while. Over it. 
---
I am tired of guns being useless. The only moment that they were fun and good to use was pre nerf TSE.Every single creature is a freaking bullet spounge in this game. 
---
Meanwhile melee rules since BETA, pretty easy to one shot enemies with crappy legendaries and destroy the queen with the right ones. Its a joke really, the iconic weaponry from the Fallout series being beaten by boards or hammers.
---
My hopes is that the opening of other vaults brings new content to the entire map, people start making new towns, perhaps we get some npcs, with new quests... 
---
A man can dream....
---
Dude, you have me confused with some gun hating liberal. I'm a lefitst, a communist, I'm also trans, and yes a foster youth advocate. I'm ready for violent revolution dude. Like, don't get me confused with soccer mom's or some shit like that. In willing to both kill you and die so that people will be nicer. 
---
You should try playing the game
---
You’re whining about. Or simply looking at the examples that are posted every day of decent camps made by competent people.
---
Exactly. I honestly wonder if Bethesda sees these posts and is discussing them or dismissing them.
---
I’m not a power player. I’m an average joe, if anything behind the curve a lot. It’s just not worth my time, even for exploration, because I can’t keep anything I find.
---
I had to delete my fucking bears to play this game. All the bears I collected? Ya. Sold. What a shame.
---
This game is the worst thing to ever happen to the fallout franchise. This is coming from a devoted fan of every iteration thus far. 
---
That true? I've had a fast travel mat in my camp leftover from the beta that I don't think has ever disappeared despite them removing it from release. 
---
Marsupial and S and N, with fireproof and a padded or dense torso mod. Just jump over them 
---
Screechy blasts.
---
The lack of a mistress in real life
---
I primarily play solo and have run into your issue too lol
---
For the past 2 months I've been living in the valley/forest area. Use it as your training ground, repeat the events as much as you can. Gather the junk, build, scrap, snipe, repeat. 
---
My two favorite spots are Graften Dam &amp; Summerville because of the Supermutants. Very easy to snipe, you get decent experience, 99% of caps, and the a boatload of weapons to either scrap or sell. (I sell.)
---
Good luck!!
---
It's worse when in a group.  If traveling alone there is less delay.
---
The answer to 100% of this games issues: 
---
&gt;if it won't immediately make extra money, it won't get fixed
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we don't, given most of the headsets for console have on/off switches which serve as our PTT.
---
And I know personally I'm more than content with open-miccing Appalachia radio. 
---
Only if they give it 0 rad resist
---
I'm reacting to you being a total trash human. Not trolling,I'm serious, I really do want you to kill yourself.
---
Yes the lower that Bethesda Nerfs my base damage , the more ammo that is necessary. It has nothing to do with armor.
---
Did you see that the dog was named?
---
People will reply: "if you're over-encumbered or in Caution, it won't let you. You'll be trapped." And to them I say, then add some other way of escaping. 
---
Me and all my buddies had never played ark before. It was 40 bucks on ps plus. With two of the three dlc’s. That and a private server to newb out. We are having a blast.
---
Actually,my foster parents were pretty great. I can tell by reading your comments,you know less than nothing about the foster care system besides what CNN told you to believe.
---
I own my own business,have a 2 year old truck I bought new that's paid for and I'm paying off my second house (first is paid for) and I'm only 41. 
---
What are some of your accomplishments? I'm pretty sure forum trolling doesn't count.
---
&gt;It's not being made HARDER, it's being made more TEDIOUS
---
This. Last night I played for about 120 minutes. An hour of that time was inventory management and the other hour was specifically hunting for plastic so I could bulk some more junk up and sell to a vendor.. So I could do a little more inventory management.
---
Didn't help that a bug was actively keeping me over encumbered. I watched as I moved a 20lb gun from my person to my stash, and maly carry weight remained unaffected.
---
But I'm not too annoyed by it because I realize Bethesda is a startup and this is their first game ever. 
---
I guess I had never taken a look at that perk because I usually don't use explosives. Thanks for the tip. I will wait until they re-decide to rebalance the game and not nerf explosives.
---
Nah, it actually got worse. This place is a ghost town now.
---
Did Rose's entire "Keys to the Past" mission....almost 2+ hours of running back and forth, and now I've reached the point where I need to turn it into her but I cannot. 
---
yay, 76. 
---
Very helpful, but also so ridiculous that we have to jump through so many hoops and seek out these "exploits" just to do things that we should be able to do anyway. 
---
I'm also not a fan of how the edges of foundations act as an invisible stair. I don't know if it's a bug or if it's intentional, but it reads like a bug to me. If I want to have access to the top of a particular foundation, I'll build a stair. If I don't want access on a particular foundation, I won't build a stair. I don't want to have a bunch of invisible ledges on the side of my house which just has walls on the top of the foundation anyway. 
---
It'll be interesting to see if Bethesda does anything about this. If anything, I hope they realize that their building restrictions are restricting creativity and make changes that actually improve the building system so we don't have to ridiculous shit like this to get the job done. Per the video, this guy spent all day trying to figure out a way to stack foundations and came up with this trick. I just want to play the game, not jump through hoops, Bethesda. 
---
&gt; I am usually against going F2P but it would be perfect for this mess IMHO.
---
I don't honestly think BGS is capable of handling a F2P game - just imagine the sheer volume of people they would get on their servers if it was free? ANY exploit would be immediately 10x worse when you unleash a horde of free2play gamers on it.
---
Ok so you agree there's a main story. Good. I don't see what your issue is with me also saying there's a main story then.
---
Quality or quantity was never part of what I said, so trying to argue about that *at* me doesn't make sense. I've just been saying there is a main story.
---
1. Make damage based on the type of bullet
---
2. Reduce the amount of ammo available in the wasteland
---
3. Make ammo -slightly- heavier
---
4. No crafting complex ammo at crafting benches
---
Congrats, now the trade off is getting/using ammo for your heavier guns which do crazy damage but also you can't carry too much. Guns that prioritize  careful shots are easier to carry but won't be able to keep up with heavy weapons designed for high-profile targets.
---
Reduce DR of enemies so they take fewer shots and aren't bullet sponges to balance the fact that people will be fighting over ammo dumps.
---
If I could lose 100 pieces of copper and gain 100 heavy weapons, yeah I'd take that bargain.
---
They made it harder because they listened to the community too much. I learned from the Halo forums that people who do nothing but cry on the forums are the 'Vocal minority' and when a company chooses to follow what said group says, the whole game gets ruined. Look at Halo 4 to Halo 5...What a total cluster fuck the campaign is. Think back on Halo Reach and how everyone bashed it for being the worse halo game ever but now its the most beloved. Fallout 76 is a good game but the developers need to worry more about fixing all of their issues before taking pointers from a community that enjoys playing on the hardest difficulty. 
---
You are talking like this shit post actually does something.
---
Stay possible when shits come again and again?
---
Like I need you or the stupid op cunt juckoff each other in this sub every day?
---
It's just that the danger part isn't there right now. 
---
Omg,you must be the SCUMMIEST , most cho-mo , worst social worker ever!
---
LMAO!!
---
I don't think they could pull this off. That would be defeat and no one would ever touch anything "online" from bethesda again.
---
But that's where most of the money lies these days, they have to turn this into a success.
---
People should give a like to his youtube video. 
---
I've upvoted you also, I'm tired of people saying this game is terrible want to know what else is tare-able? Paper and I don't see people bitching about that...
---
Anyhoo yes the game is NOT perfect. And the hardcore players may hate this game but it's fun and I'm happy that my glitch I was having from one of the updates got fixed (my characters were paralyzed and I was unable to move anywhere or do anything.
---
What are the pieces?
---
I played over 3 days before I was able to get radaway and had to do quests to get caps for one. But my health was 3/4 radiation and 1/4 actual health so I constantly had to eat an drink which just added more rads. Took a couple times because I kept dying but I got it eventually 
---
No no no don't give them ideas!
---
Great pic by the way.
---
It would seem my original post got downvoted. Oh well I kind expected some kind of negative response.
---
Given how strong Melee is in the first place. I was expecting to be bombarded by "OMG LOL No that would make melee even more op" comments. 
---
The other side of the river is Ohio.  You don't want to go there :)
---
If there is no need to "try" then in my books it's not worth playing. Because this is going to be like playing basketball, where both teams win, while they don't even try, they just stand on basketball court. Without need to try, you can't fail and if you can't fail then there nothing to overcome.
---
The invisible foundation stairs are so annoying. I don't know if it's a bug or intentional (*probably intentional*), but it reads like a bug to me.
---
Correct
---
***^(that's what you)*** ***GET !***
---
It's for Enclave intelligent Deathclaw? It's so cool
---
&gt; They don't PLAY the game. 
---
Having worked in games this is much more common than you would hope. 
---
&gt; And they don't rent pro playtesters to play for them.
---
I said it in another thread but it bears repeating: playtesters/QA can only list problems. Someone in management has to *agree* that they are problems, and *allocate* the design/dev time to fix the problems. 
---
I bet you 10 caps that people have filed bugs on the same stuff we gripe about here, and those bugs are ignored or closed as "by design."
---
It's also possible that many dev resources are stuck working on some other new feature, which slows the pace of improvement on the *current* game to a crawl, even though everyone knows its busted as shit. 
---
Water Purifiers seem to share water generation times with other purifiers in the vicinity. The more purifiers you have, the slower they fill. You're best off dropping to 2-3 purifiers, max. 
---
You think FO76 is in a better place than the Anthem demo? Ok first off, yes there were some issues the VIP weekend but the Anthem demo is like an 8 week old build now... and has far fewer issues than FO76 does what 3 months down the line... I'm a mega FO fan boy but 76 and its issues have beaten me like a red-headed step child... 
---
hey, you never know. maybe we do!
---
"can we all agree" lol
---
This post speaks to me on several levels, specifically because my group of friends started a joke between us of saying "What if I'm not *suffering* from RadWorms? What if I'm *enjoying them* ?"
---
Yup, been saying this for a while now. It needs to be either a rifle or a heavy weapon. Only bloody mess increases its base damage right now.
---
My theory is they never changed the classification for it after they cut “Exotic” weapons. Though the crossbow is affected by rifleman I think so it’s strange the railway rifle would’ve been overlooked. 
---
Mediocre
---
You mean the people that have to use workarounds to get their camps that good? People needing to build their walls in a specific order so they don't get a "object can not be placed" error? You mean the people that have to resort to glitches to place objects? Yes, they are way more competent in building than I am. But spending hours trying to figure out how to place a wall wouldn't even be necessary if the game was half way competent.
---
Lmao!!!
---
Wow. You are one truly  sad and confused little boy. 
---
Hilariously sad and pathetic all at once.
---
I'm laughing so hard right now.
---
You must be FURIOUS I'm not angry!
---
Lolololololol....m
---
Really, someone needs to explain to them what "Floating" means.  I cant snap a floor to a legged foundation but i can create a spiral to god with a metal staircase and a floating floor? 
---
The support beams under stairs never work because they intersect with an object. The fucking ground?   
---
We need just about all the build items from FO4 back.  The wooden stairs that will sink into the ground.  The foundation stairs are almost impossible to snap to anything or use.  
---
Last but not least.  A god damn inside corner roof panel.  Seriously.  How is this not a thing?  You want an L shaped wall.  It will cost you 5 extra build pieces to close the corner.
---
Honestly, I feel like they are pushing pvp WAY too hard. Most of the balance changes seem to be PvP focused and the game simply doesn't have the mechanics, design, or a rewarding system to support PvP. At this point, I am a little salty about it even being included. At worst it is an open door for griefers and at best it is an inconvenience. 
---
I don't care what the strongest build is. I don't care who can one shot me with this or that build. What I do care about is whatever build I choose feeling viable to play in the existing content. It seems like every patch is pushing us a little bit further towards power armor melee as being "the build" rather than just a build that you can play and actually have fun with...
---
So now you're just going to make shit up? Bethesda has yet to directly nerf the base damage of any weapons. In fact they INCREASED the damage for automatic receivers by 20% in December.
---
I’m strictly melee, and have been since level 50. No issues with your post here buddy. I find it awesome that there are people out there that are asking questions like this about possible features. It’ll only make the game better imo.
---
This happens with me and resource generator at public workshops, silver copper junk...
---
If I don’t check periodically there will lots waiting for me to transfer.
---
Nothing.  I built an alt and that bought some more time but I haven’t played in weeks now.  Player vendor stations would have helped a lot.  Throwing away 99% of what I was grinding for was too much, and trying to maintain posts on reddit and meet people to trade wasn’t worth the coordination headache.
---
 I’m glad someone as stupid as you is having such a difficult time.
---
Oh totally, the kids hate me, they tell me every day as i try and convince them not to commit suicide after some asshole on the internet triggers them. I'm this serious because assholes like you have no fucking clue the impactthey have on others. You want to call me a troll and a Nazi for reacting militantly towards assholes, that's cool. I've got nothing to prove here to you or anyone else. So keep running your mouth kid. You love lickingthose boots, I can tell, you probably licked a bunch of boots during your time in the system. You were probably one of those kids that started shit and then ratted out other people for reacting while you sucked up to your shitty fomo or staff or whatever the fuck

Crashed on me again earlier, getting bored with losing ammo and restarting to find tougher opponents to achieve the same end. Might leave it a month for further fixes.
---
changing the carry weight value of a bobbypin seems to strain their infrastructure beyond the breaking point. What makes you think they have anything like a toolchain or staffing or update infrastructure that can do any of that? 
---
This happens for any assaultron head, and has been a bug since release.
---
Hope they don't patch this, tho I'm worried this could be abused in the future.
---
You guys need to read this loser's other comments before upvoting this comment.
---
He is exactly the polar opposite of this statement. 
---
oh yeah. duh.
---
they should just turn of building if the player is in pvp active mode with another player AND present at their own camp. otherwise it’s fortnite
---
I manage the stash mess by limiting my junk items to set levels.  For instance, max 100 of say springs, screws, etc.  The only exceptions are of course lead, steel, gunpowder.  However when those items get to a larger number I go ahead and make ammo to reduce them.  The hardest part was not keeping every weapon I come across.  Instead I just sell anything that's not 3*.
---
This is why I left. 100 hours I saw most of the content but was having fun still. But the game design team is working with satan or something. The game only needed bug fixes and content tbh. 
---
Fallout since the 4 game is a FPS with some dialogue choices. Has some story but the main thing is the shooting. When the iconic weaponry of the game is weaker than a freaking board something is really wrong.
---
And how does guns being better than melee defeats the purpose of playing? Are you serious? Melee in FPS games are mindless and boresome, very few games manage to make it engaging (Kingdom Come for example). When you have amazing unique guns in the game but they are beaten by using a board or a sledge hammer something is serious wrong.
---
Nerf melee to the ground too, bring it on par with guns. If something takes 20 shots with the BEST gun to kill (right legendary affixes have 1 chance in a million, someone made a chart) then melee should take at least 10 hits to do the same.
---
Pvp games are susceptible to metas, but this game pushes it to a whole new level, as if they want you to use more hammers than Skyrim. It almost seems like a joke.
---
Agreed.
---
I actually reinstalled FO4 just because I wanted a game that was still about fun.  Sadly, FO76 still makes some great improvements that I miss in FO4, but I can't even enter a nuke zone without instantly crashing, so I'll just hope something actually changes one day.
---
Communication that's as mature and respectful as gravestones within Oregon Trail on your library's Apple IIe's
---
I uninstalled the game, after I found out I couldn't respec and got stuck with a crappy build.  Along with the numerous bugs / exploits / and shit PVP system; I was glad to get out.   Very disappointed with this game.  
---
ha! i actually came to this game because i was tired of all the PVP in other games.
---
Liar.
---
I'd say the Ash Heap and Savage Divide are good places for you at that level. You should also see about making some friends to adventure with who are of similar level. I know it can seem like a huge leap for a Fallout veteran, and for the first 30 levels or so I was pridefully soloing everything myself, but trust me: It's more fun and more stimulating with a group. Find someone else on the map who looks like they're around your level and shoot them a team invite. You never know. I've made plenty of online friends by doing so, and the annoying ones... well, I just ignore them. 
---
This said, if you want to level grind, start doing lots and lots of events. "Uranium Fever" is probably the most fun, most rewarding one in the game, it usually has multiple participants, and is a great place to level grind. 
---
Also, whenever you're near the Whitesprings, head over to the golf club. It's the most popular location in the game for grinding and farming for a reason: It constantly spawns loads of high-level ghouls with good loot. Keep those mines and grenades handy for when they bottleneck in tight corridors and such! 
---
Also, if you're level 27, it's time for you to suit up in a power armour suit. Look into the "Miner Miracles" quest to get yourself an Excavator suit, which is tremendously useful for a number of reasons. 
---
Ok not base damage.....my bad bro.....did I misspelled any words or have any grammar errors you'd like to point out?
---
You get the point........my TS  handmade doesn't do as much damage as it did a week ago and now I need to grind for more ammo and repair my gun more often.
---
I've read your comment history......I get it you're an anti TSE troll.
---
PA glitch works on consoles btw
---
A lot of companies try something new.  What the issue is they marketed it as a AAA game and charged full price.  
---
They gave it to a studio that previously failed and can't even do basic deployments.  That's why people are not giving it a pass.
---
There's a difference between a game which challenges and has you try and a game which makes you grind and waste time for arbitrary reasons though. 
---
FO76 leans more towards the later. 
---
Well, thank you. And yeah I'm pretty heavy melee myself but that's because it's a bit difficult to keep up on the ammo count for a commando build which is why I resort to my revolutionary sword a lot of the time. 
---
This.  
---
The grind fest is a lazy alternative for more content. People are quitting left and right as a result
---
No, but either way I bet the server crashes.
---
Will you take 500 caps for one of the arms?
---
its a part of the vault area.
---
I am very low level in FO76, and about the same kind of lowbie in Destiny 2. 
---
They are very different kind of games, but the pace of progression and the way rewards are handed out in D2 is very very smooth and polished. It makes me look forward to the next time I play in a way that FO76 never has. 
---
I’m in the same spot, they usually stay put unless you wander close their camp. Sometimes it’s mole men or col. gutsys. It’s fun to chuck artillery smoke grenades down the street at them. 
---
It's not about having to try in the game. I am all for a challenge in the gameplay. I am talking about trying to have fun in the game. Right now, as many others have pointed out, the game is continually progressing towards grind materials to repair weapons and armor so that you can grind materials to repair... 
---
That is the end game right now. 
---
It feels like working a minimum wage job in real life. 
---
... and you got these plans, how? Asking for a n00b friend. 
---
I said I didn't have a chance to block the other person and once I switched servers their name is gone, I didn't write it down, didn't have a chance. Anyhow, my friends are scared becuase these people are coming to wherever I am and destroying my base or the base of whoever I am hanging out with. They are making it a point to find me is my point. The lenghts this person has gone to in order to find me across servers, I have NO DOUBT this asshat has friends who are not blocked who are now going to be looking for me. There is something at stake for those who spend a lot of time building their homes and don't want them entirely destroyed.
---
Man if Vendors didn't have cap limit, I would have bought best gear in one day and I would been done. Instead I was active for weeks after I was done with quests.
---
Should've kept it
---
One reason for seeing empty loot window is that you didn't do enough damage. If you did though, you should at the very least see the buffering icon.
---
Trolling would imply I wasn't serious. I'm not trying to upset you or get a rise out of you. I'm telling you how I feel about you. And I feel that you shouldn't be alive.
---
I dont need caps. I just want a legendary handmade. 
---
I think if they made it like ESO where its a totally optional part of the game but still has zero bearing on how the game is played, I have no issues with adding in a PVP area.
---
Now if they make it like a PVP WoW server where everyone is free game, that'll change a LOT of the game and i would think most of the playerbase would dip out instantly. 
---
Once you get used to the game, food and water is tedium that you could do without. Enemies are to easy and when you're overweight might as well make a new character.
---
I hate that they have time for nerfs, but none to solve issues. They finally just decided to address the weapons mod scrapping problem. Considering it wasn't  like that in Fallout 4, I dont understand why it was made like this in the first place. This should have been addressed during the BETA. As far as your gripes, it wouldn't be so bad if they gave us an actual stash and made our perks work with it. Even when they increased it before, because of my perks I was only able to store some of what I had since it all went back to original weight in the Stash. Sad when your character can carry more than the Stash. It's supposed to be the other way around. My suggestion is they make it so the Stash can equip any weight reduction Perk Cards. Make it so you can add one every 10 levels and make it so no matter the cards level, the card only takes up one slot. So basically 5 slots. Theres just so much cool stuff and its painful to drop so many great items. If they did that then at least you would be able to have spare armor to use until you repair yours. They should have thought that through before release. You're taking a player base used to Fallout 4 where you could keep everything. Even in survival mode you could store things in other settlements and containers. Plus is it me or does it seem like they are using sit quality server hardware? I think some out of touch pencil pusher who understands nothing about  games, games, hardware or software. Probably thought that the same servers used for Fallout Shelter would be more than enough to run 76. Lol It would explain a lot. 
---
And who would have figured you're a fucking TSE crybaby. Bethesda is never giving you your God weapon back, learn to play the game like everyone else. 
---
I forget where I read this, but 
---
(counterintuitively) the rate at which your water purifiers produce water is not affected by the number of purifiers you have, the number only affects how much water they can store.
---
For example, if water purifiers produce 1 purified water per 10 minutes, and you have the basic kind that can hold 2 purified water,  20 purifiers won't be any better than 2 minutes until after 50 minutes. See below...
---
Minutes     2 Purifiers     20 Purifiers

I can excuse all of it except how they treated the beta just as a marketing tool and to farm those juicy pre-orders.
---
If I start something I have no experience in and expect to fall flat on my ass multiple times, wouldn't I plan to do an extensive long going beta?
---
I am playing a complex aRPG now for several years and everytime they had to do large overhauls for balancing (as in entire systems) they did a beta for months, must have been 4 by now.
---
Who at bethesda decided that they don't need a beta even though it was crystal clear to them how important testing would be.
---
I like playing FO76 better than RDR2. Just my personal preference but I wouldn't say it's superior in any way other than UI and combat.  
---
I've done it twice solo, neither time was it close.
---
The baffling thing is that the exact same problems were in FO4. It's just 76's environment is only highlighting even more how bad they are.
---
&gt;tfw you didn't actually watch the vid and dont know what you're talking about
---
I actually kinda liked the nerf on TSEs.  I used to just fly through the silos, it was so easy it was just tedious.  By reducing the damage, it actually became a challenge again, and although it took longer it felt less tedious because I was actually having to focus on what I was doing.
---
How do I add an image 
---
Saw a pic on the xbox sub of the giving it away with the f76 xbox one x bundle. So you get it twice
---
Yeah don't think mod plans are available. Just mods from the enclave. But it's only headlamp ones when I go there or rusty bloody knuckles
---
Same here i used disease cure and no more mutations
---
Yeah bro, I run around on the internet "trolling" while sobbing into my chair tea and spinning my prayer wheel. Dude I grew up on the internet try harder.
---
Cracks me up every time I hear it!
---
When a game is a FPS and the best builds are melee oriented you know something is wrong. There is nothing more boresome and mindumbing than melee in FPS games. Its ridiculous how shots poke enemies while melee one shot stuff.
---
In this game a mini NUKE is weaker than an old board. Its pathetic. Make guns useful, the only time they became reasonable viable was during the pre nerf TSE.
---
This might be a stretch, but I would love to see some campaign posters (congressional and/or presidential) of John F. Kennedy. I'm surprised he was not mentioned in Fallout 4 since he was from Boston. This could be a nice way to reference The Commonwealth, as well as acknowledge JFK's real-life visits to West Virginia.
---
Yeah I agree that’s unacceptable but that’s how we live these days, I was around but I don’t remember anyone threatening to ban people...are you taking about hamish?
---
I agree. Sad part is that if they had just given us a reasonable stash size then most of the weight supers wouldn't have duped. 
---
So how did it go?  I'm still going strong at level 70.  Zero regrets.  Honestly, wish I had played my first character like this. :)
---
Weird thing to lie about but whatever bro, everyone who thinks you should die is a lying troll right?
---
Excellent job, and I'm a professional illustrator.  I would NEVER want to fight one of those, given how strong the melee and power armor combo is.
---
Sure, at the same time they give us single-shot rifle peons the same.
---
&gt; Technical Data to do the repeatable quest Forbidden Knowledge. I'm trying to aquire some Brotherhood paint for my power armor. Does anyone know if turning in stacks of TD versus single turn in increases your chance of something good? I have been doing single turn in trips and have gotten some clothes and a legendary chest but mostly caps and ammo. I have done around 25 with the most stacked being 4 I think.

You just harvest plants in the wild then make or find fertilizer.  Good to go!

LoL. I believe THAT last sentence.
---
Keep deleting y our posts though. Screen shots are great. You can't delete those. Rofl.
---
You need like 12 mins to be safe. If the timer is under 10 min, you should just leave.
---
Only difference between you and I is that you didn't use a TS or E weapon pre nerf so you've been whining about something that didn't effect you.
---
Why would you care if the game is easy for someone else?
---
Did you get owned in PvP by a TSE? Did someone one shot a legendary with a TSE at the loot cave before you could tag it?.......poor baby.
---
&gt; this is not skyrim the ranged builds must be the meta!!!  
---
Pretty sure everyone plays a stealth archer in Skyrim...
---
I did it first try solo... And I got down to 2 seconds left. The trick is to melee all of the fireflies.
---
I think the go to combo for rifles and pistols should be VATS criticals. We have a good combination of mechanics we can take advantage of to get over that DR hump. Perks, legendary prefixs, clip mods, mutations, headshots, critical hits and sneak attacks all together will multiply our ‘pitiful’ damage while simultneously lowering the DR of enemies. The tools are all there. Our understanding of how to use them is not. If I have a gun with 100 damage per shot and the enemy has 200 DR, I will be suffering huge damage penalties. But, if I have 50% anti armor and shoot the enemy in the head with a critical headshot, the comparison is no longer 100 to 200; it is now somewhere around 300 to 100 or better. What I do not know is the damage bonus for headshots or critical hits. Sneak attacks tell us it is 2 times or more with perks. What we need to do is figure out is how these bonuses work in tandem.
---
As for heavy weapons... I do not know. Maybe we are supposed to be tanks and support with them. Maybe grab some damage reflection mutations and perks and just take hits. Maybe grab animal friend and spend time pacifying adds for SBQ. It would be super useful, but not all that fun.
---
Yeah, it does. If a freaking gun takes 20 shots to kill something melee should need to hit at least 10 times to kill as well.
---
Melee is king in this FPS what makes it an instant fail. There is nothing more boresome and mindumbing than melee in a first person shooter. Just doesn't work well.
---
Yes. Thank you so much for writing this out. I have had a lot of thoughts about the combat economy, the diversity potential, and the meta and yeah, the way it is right now, it is cutting itself off at the knees. Certain weapons are superior than others by nature in almost all situations, damage types do not have enough value or variety, and basically everything forces the endgame into a world where everyone is walking around with the exact same gear and trying to get first shot so they can win. There is *some* variety and I appreciate the small amount that does exist, but something absolutely must be done about the fundamental problem before this game can see it's true potential. 
---
Alright no problem. If you change your mind at any time I'll buy them from you.
---
Two words.
---
Screen Shots.
---
One bit of feedback is that changing to a new build that requires changing SPECIAL points and picking new perks is doubly frustrating, since you can _only_ change a SPECIAL stat OR pick a new perk with each new level. Grinding out so many levels just to shuffle points around with no tangible improvement is time consuming and not fun. 
---
Here’s an idea - add a consumable “respec token” to the game. Upon use, it would refund all SPECIAL points and remove all perk cards that were chosen from leveling up, allowing the player to pick a new selection of perk cards equal to the number refunded. Cards earned through perk packs won’t be removed, but will be returned to rank 1 if they were leveled and the appropriate amount of perk cards used for ranking up will be refunded. 
---
Add it to the Atom Shop if you want, but make it reasonable. Say, 200 Atoms. You can easily earn that through a few days worth of dailies/weeklies and just playing the game.
---
I liked the Mysteries quests for precisely this reason.  Go all over the place, learn interesting things, find interesting places, get interesting rewards.  Ok sure, they kinda sucked long term, but at least those items can be upscaled with you, unlike pretty much every other quest reward unique game item.  When I do eventually create a new character its going to be a female toon specializing in pistols and 1 handed melee.  I will absolutely ROCK the mysteries gear (particularly once I get/pay for Marsupial and Chameleon)
---
I've about 50 disease cures, the perk card for finding Chems really helps!
---
The plants are under the "Food" tab.  Find a corn, plant a corn.  Boom
---
I have wondered this myself. I saw a player clean house with a quad double barrel shotgun once (essentially an eight shot semi auto), so in theory it should be in the drop table. 
---
You'll notice that the wikia page for DR that I linked doesn't even have info for 76 because everyone knows that they just copy-pasted the mechanics of FO4. That said, couldn't agree more. It's manageable in single player when you can mod and have unlimted perks (remember that?), but in this format, it is blisteringly obvious that something is wrong.
---
Yes! Everyone show him some love he deserves it
---
This is the sort of vigilante justice I can get behind. Good work, the both of you. 
---
Oh ,don't worry. I never get upset at mentally challenged people. 
---
LoL.
---
Nah, I stand by everything I've said in this thread, and nothing I've said elsewhere goes against my sentiments here.  We're you a nice, respectful human being, I would treat you like anyone else. It's clear you are a monumental piece of shit, and unlike the liberals you think I am I'm not interested in being nice or tolerating shit heads like you.
---
Its not a simple 1 to 1 comparison,  AA still affects ballistic damage so as long as you're not just aiming for the ground, AA can be better than TS vs. heavily armored targets for the ballistic portion of the damage.  AAE vs. TSE has multiple factors in play so it will play out different vs. different targets, I wouldn't say TSE outright is better over AAE now.  Especially vs. the queen and her high ballistic DR, AAE might be a better choice.
---
Too many people are just looking at the explosive effect and forgetting about the ballistic part of the equation, which is far far more important now to your overall damage output.

I just like the extra 100lbs of carry weight. I'm level 36 now though and I've been considering trying out another set. Are the others worth giving up the carry weight? Do they have benefits too?
---
You're welcome, just ask if you want any more precise info
---
Melee should had been nerfed a LONG time ago. Its a first person SHOOTER game with some small bits of RPG but for some reason guns blow. Add to that the fact that melee is mindumbing and boresome in first person games, it just doesnt work well. First person games are balanced around aiming and guns, melee should be a secondary thing.
---
Lmfao!
---
There is a fix. Take out the assaultron head. Place all your ammo into a container. Pick your ammo up and it should work as intended. 
---
Are you over lvl 100?
---
Yes it happens quite regularly now it seems :(
---
I think most game developers can learn about difficulty from what Soulsborne has to say (I'm not saying make games as hard as them but take some design cues from it.)
---
It's not about how much enemies absorb damage or how much damage they deal when they hit you. It's about making them surprise you, engage with you and outsmart you. At least until you can do the same back to them. 
---
I remember a modder took a look at the same issue in Skyrim as they found the game's adaptive difficulty did nothing to make the game harder except dial up health and damage in enemies. He instead gave them a few sets of AI instructions to better handle combat with just a bit of intelligence (like taking cover and flanking, etc.) and found not only did the difficulty immediately spike, but that it was way more engaging and each encounter meant something.
---
I haven't deleted anything,most likely they are being removed by mods.
---
Oh no, you have screen shots of me being me on the internet, whatever shall I do. 
---
I've noticed quite a few mod weapons that are autos (like the H&amp;K G11 mod) tend to have damage scaling options on the workbench solely to deal with the endlessly inflating armor values.
---
When I hear these stories I just think caps. I could farm caps there.
---
if the "reserved space" file under your saves gets deleted or corrupt you lose your photos
---
That's why you deleted half your comments that proved you a social outcast? Ok. 
---
LoL
---
It's a drag. Even regular enemies take awhile to kill. Wasting ammo and durability.  Making a guy grind for more junk.....
---
Am I able to spawn and get inside this way too?
---
Yeah, I'm tired of it. Too much grind for what? Nothing. I don't get that feeling of being an absolute bad ass that I do after working so hard in other games. I don't want to work hard for nothing 
---
Im a melee player with all of the melee perk cards and a level 50 all rise.
---
With all of the Perk cards and a 200% repaired All Rise and NO mutations an NO bobble heads my all rise does around 300 damage.
---
**Where is this players addition 150 damage come from on a weapon with what looks like 70% condition?** 
---
**THIS IS NOT NORMAL MELEE DAMAGE!!!!!**
---
This one is a feature!
---
If you go through my post history you'll see I tell worthless fuck nuts like yourself to kill themselves often. I always mean it and I never delete my comments. Your a fucking bully,you know it,and your trying to turn it around on me because you all fucking do that. You will never be worth anything to anyone because you don't give a fuck about anyone but yourself. Now go make your date with the barrel of a shotgun you fucking loser.
---
Okay dude, I can respect that. Both games online modes have been a bit of a let down to me and I hope they fix them and they evolve into something great like GTA Online did.
---
Uh ,no.
---
Nice try there 'bro'.
---
I'm a rifle user. Any good stuff? 
---
&gt; TS nerf was not needed imo.
---
Yes, yes it was. Adding +100% damage unconditionally was so far above the other perks it needed to be brought in to line.
---
&gt; Same with nerfing QOL perks when the game is a mess in many regards.
---
This part I agree with, White Knight made the game playable. If it was over-performing then the base durability of non-powered armor needs to be increased.
---
"I am a veteran of Bethesda Open World Games with **10,000 hours into FO3, FNV, Skyrim and FO4**. "  
---
And you need help on how to level up ?  
---
Just do as you did for the other games, walk around, kill enemies, do events/quests.  
---
I used to farm plans at top of the world for plans. No idea if it is nerfed
---
Use https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/ and chose all the plans and you can see where they spawn. Top of the world/pleasant valley cabins has a high density of plans and loose mods
---
I have a jetpack on my x01 I dont think you can get that for the excavator. Also there are power armor mods that add carry weight. I thinks it's called stabilized shocks each leg adds 50 carry weight. 
---
I almost got too attached to the excavator. The carry weight is good for your level though. Harvest a lot of materials. 
---
In that case, two hits. One to stagger them, one to clonk them.
---
No, for 2 reasons.
---
1: Talons, it’s a flat 25 percent damage buff that requires no additional perk investment, keeping unarmed melee in a nice and low costing perk state. I fill it up with perks like blocker and barbarian that are important, but when I have 9 super sledge perks, I just drop.
---
2: the base damage is RIDICULOUSLY high. I’m hitting a bit above 400 without the iron fist perk, and around 500 with it on. More perks would result in about 7-800 damage, and that’s insane, cause 400-500 one shots players.  My supersledge, with 30 percent buff (equal perk investment, actually more damage for 3 perks) is around 370. This doesn’t even include legendary efffects on the weapon (yes with the armor tho, and no chems). More damage with the super sledge is feasible,  but I’m talking equal perk investment. If I unequipped my protection perks (arguably more important) I could receive slightly higher damage.
---
I run instigating on both, so it’s about 1000 damage, vs about 740 on the first strike. I could provide build and gear specs if you need help or think my math is wrong.
---
It’s a game of protection over unnecessary damage. And the protection, especially against melee attacks and a solid 80 DR buff is more important to me.
---
if you are having issues taking new pics delete that file under your saves it will not affect your game other than losing your pics which has already happened
---
I imagine there are going to be a hundred articles telling us it's okay to start playing now. Hopefully sometime in the near future.
---
maybe they can assign pvp players inside a camp a building class so they’re interpreted like any other object: can’t place when another item is present.
---
Me too. I want to love the game, but the problems are too much.  I started Fallout 4 again and I'm having so much fun. I'm starting a playthrough with the Sim Settlements Conquerer mod. Changes everything. One of the only ways they could save the game is to allow people to use their own private servers (not Bethesdas servers that were probably designed for mobile games like Fallout Shelter and Candy Crush) and allow them to mod. The murders would probably not only fix so many of the issues, but also make amazing content that will bring people back in droves. They have proven that they are capable, so they might as well let the modding community do it, because you know they will mod the shit out of that game while solving problems. 
---
Two I found in Watoga one at Harpers. They are listed under notes at the vendor but don’t show up every time you go. Dense is a mod, and I have no idea how I got BOS other than completing their quests. 
---
Stop reporting me for making you feel bad about yourself and maybe the mods will stop deleting my comments.
---
Your first 2 issues have work around via bugs and the campfire item
---
I dont want big bad bethesda to patch it out so I wont write how to do it here, just look up stackable foundations on YouTube
---
From the tapes people put in order from the enclave bunker everything that went wrong in West Virginia was caused by the Enclave. MODUS himself is malfuctioning, no sane person would enter that bunker after hearing the tapes. Pretty much a skynet with a creppy voice.
---
This is why I have a very, very simple camp.  However, I certainly see the problem if you have an elaborate one.
---
I too would love 'adventure' PvE only instances that would be separate from the main game ( similar to the 'survival' PvP mode they are working on ).
---
Toads should respawn if you run from house to slightly past lighthouse. 
---
LoL. 
---
Come on. 
---
You can do better than that lame comment.
---
You've been so entertaining.
---
Don't fail me now....
---
It's not the trying something new that people seem to be having the biggest issues with. It's the failing at trying to make something work thing. Much much bigger deal.
---
I did my first silo run at level 80, with nothing but a shotgun and All Rise. It was laughably easy. Last night, I did my second silo run, at level 108, with All Rise and my TSE Gatling gun. It was *WAY* harder than at level 80. 
---
I don't know if they made the silo runs harder or what, but it wasn't because of the TSE.
---
I have been using a ton of water as well, even just standing around crafting, something is definitely different....

Fallout Deathclaw review: This game makes you feel like a Deathclaw
---
Whoa whoa you silly little boy. What are you talking about here? First they need to make ranged weapons scale with Perception. 
---
...and the actual sad part is that, every useless people that comes to event is ramping up SBQ defense and you have no power over who is coming into that event. Doing alone SBQ it takes around 3 minutes to kill her, with regular weapon and no exploits. Those low levels who come into SBQ are the real "griefers" of the game.
---
Uh, yeah,nice try there "worthless piece of shit".
---
They should be as big, varied, and important to the lore as Blackreach in Skyrim.  These are supposed to house thousands of people for decades, they should be big.  
---
I haven't reported anything.
---
Too busy laughing.
---
It does already in-game. It displays a message in a box on lower right corner of the screen saying something like: "Problem connecting with server, freezing controls" or something like that. It definitely doesn't show it as much as it probably should though. I always get the spinning arrows especially in Whitesprings Golf Club when I kill like 20 of them and try to loot the bodies. Sometimes they loot never spawns and I just end up leaving it which sucks. 
---
It's 6.3k
---
&gt; Is there something I'm missing?
---
Bethesda tried to make an MMO and failed
---
No issues on ps4 just logged off after 45min of smooth playing
---
Maybe you should try and doxx me so you can come to my house and show me in person how much of an asshole you are.
---
Nice! Another SS. Thx 'bro'!
---
99.9% of our complaints? I could start a list but you know they've addressed a lot more than .1% of our complaints... I'd say they've actually addressed a fair amount of our complaints... 
---
Yeah this isn't even particularly high for melee damage.
---
If anyone off the street equips a Super Sledge with the relevant damage perks it deals more damage than a player has health and has 75% armor penetration.
---
Add that the game has a built-in short range teleport + aimbot and it should have been very obvious this would be a problem.
---
they should nerf mutations because thats what makes this guy OP
---
This is objectively false. It depends on the gun. I have to repair my heavy and energy weapons far too often. It takes quite a lot more ammo to kill things now. 
---
That's what gets me.  I understand the ammo thing, I burn through bullets against the larger enemies (SB's and MQs and Deathclaws)....but anything less than that, as long as I stay hidden....1 shot, 3 at the most.  I only have to repair my armor if I screw up and get spotted by lots of things shooting me.  And weapons....get Gunsmith 5, you'll feel like you never have to repair a broken gun ever again.  Particularly if you pair it with the luck perk that repairs weapons on hit.  Beautiful for shotguns and automatics.  
---
If you're running Pure melee or shotgun, and just trying to tank all the damage coming in....Yea that's a simpler play style and things arguably die *faster*...but it takes more bullets to kill things, and you take more damage, which means both more bullets to buy/make, and more wear and tear on both armor and weapons.  Not an easily sustainable playstyle.  
---
To be fair, you shouldn't be railroaded into any given playstyle for fun sustainable play....but you have to understand that different styles have different trade-offs.  Fast and furious is one play style, you sacrifice bullets and durability.  Slow and steady is another, but you sacrifice speed and overall damage per second in return for damage per hit and less overall cost for repairs and bullets.  Melee is high damage, but again, you're gonna have to tank a lot of close range damage.  Explosives....well those just kinda suck right now, but they claim to be working on it....  
---
Anyway, there's give and take in there.
---
Yes, this is not the first game I have been through this with. It sucks that they did this after launch though. I played a game called fallen earth years ago that I made a sniper build and it was nerfed so badly you  were essentially a Melee fighter which made no sense. It was so stupid that I just stopped playing, I hope they dont make any further changes here to make it that drastic, I understand trying to balance things a bit but leveling everything is not the right way to do it...
---
Nothing. I finally gave up about 10 days ago.
---
Interestingly enough, it motivated me to play Fallout 4 all over again, with a bunch of neat mods and man, the game looks so much better too.
---
Having played mmo's and diablo  games for years, this is nothing tbh.
---
considering melee can output over 5k without even trying, I'd say it doesn't really matter whether they're bloodied then
---
And here I am waiting for elevators to be added as an ATOM shop item...
---
I have a few. 3* two shot gaus. Furious, instigating and vampires handmade. 3* anti armor explosive sniper rifle. Vampires gays rifle. 1* zealots black powder rifle. 
---
or is it a feature?
---
In fallout 4, melee was much more powerful. I could hit about 3000 with Atom’s judgement.
---
It probably wouldn't be soo bad if it weren't for the crashes happening during the fight, the last two times I tried the queen the game crashed and one time I couldn't loot after and the second time there was no way to get back to the server. Why waste so many resources on that when it's just frustrating?
---
Haha. Fast traveling to an Event puts you into interior which is restricted area and being there is against the rules. Good job, Bethesda! You always manage to surprise me.
---
There is little love for stealth snipers on this forum, It seems like people think if you don't play melee people you're doing it wrong. I hope they eventually fix wood to offer 3* drops. 
---
You can see pipes going down into the concrete foundation, so I assumed it was tapping ground water.
---
Man, does it ever stop? ;)
---
Vampire gaus. Not gays. Fml
---
I use a TSE pump and its not that bad.  Its more challenging again. Before the patch it was just one-shot killing enemies.  At least stimpacks are usefull again. 
---
Oh, I'd love to have you look at me in person and ruin your mouth. I would LOVE to see how drastically your attitude would change,lol.
---
Have we resorted to internet G now?
---
'Doxx' , lmao. Another tween phrase....
---
The harder you try to sound all grown up ,the harder I laugh.
---
Incredible! I hope they never patch this
---
Most effective ranged would probably be a bloody handmade with vats crit and sneak. Not as op as melee but should be manageable ammo and repair wise. Anti armor syringer helps alot. 
---
Leveling up in FO76 is pretty fast by MMO standards. If they want to treat it like an MMO, it makes sense to slow it down, but that only goes so far until you simply need more content and progression.
---
I love the detail of the world, but they don't give players much motivation to go out and find it all. The coolest places to explore have no quests or rewards associated with them.
---
And don't let anyone tell you what is and isn't a real word.
---
This is all assaultron heads, not just legendaries. Energy weapons are weak anyways currently so no use until they buff them.
---
IDK what they did, but I wasn't getting great drop before, now I'm getting LOTS of drops and none of them very good. probably a 2 star every 10-20 drops and a 3 star every 50-100 or so... But I'm getting legendary drops from stuff that's not even legendary. Idk wtf is going on. 
---
Ya, I've been ooted up to 5 times in a row before trying to do one event. Probably one reason I haven't had the drive to even play the game in the past few weeks. At lvl 91, Im kinda over it. They really failed us.
---
They wanted to jump on the battle royal train with a fallout twist.  They expected  it to be a free for all with a few missions in there to keep us busy between hunting other players.
---
Yes, we are working on a visual roadmap to show you all! We have a lot of awesome content planned for you all! I hope to have an update for you on when it will be released soon.
---
They claimed to have fixed the bug that made SBQ stay after time runs out.
---
There's nothing to "fix" except maybe your understanding about how water purifiers work.
---
They create waters at the stated rate but can only hold a specific amount. You can leave your camp and come back to exactly the expected amount of water each time.
---
The GTA Online method.
---
“Just add in the code” - see... easy guys.
---
Moron.
---
Oh man, you sure your not 61 instead of 41. Go back to the elks Lodge old man.
---
We all don't hate Bethesda for trying something new, no one here is. Saying that is not listening to the all the feedback here. 
---
We are pissed off by Bethesda because they constantly take one step forward and two steps back. Because they don't inlcude their fanbase, fucking up the simplest things, break game mechanics which weren't broken but not fixing the ones which were broken from the start.
---
Because they don't recognize that this experiment is going to fail if they not switch to crisis mode really soon.
---
I was wondering what happened to it... I had some guy give me one, told me if I melted it I would learn the plan to make it ( which I did) and  made/gave a couple to some friends. now the hood is gone and I can't make it any longer either.
---
they can clearly make locations and quests, so yeah, they just need to make new ones and add it. 
---
Except every good weapon in that universe would cost like 10 billion caps since caps would have no actual value
---
&gt;At level 30 you should be able to kill a level 5 super mutant in a single hit with a decent, non legendary, rifle.
---
Yeah, that was what really bothered me about the guy's post. If you're struggling to take down lvl 5 super mutants at lvl 30, it's not the game that's the problem. 
---
Well, I mean, on some level it *is* the game, because Fallout 76 does fuck all to hold your hand and walk you through its more complex systems. I wonder if some players would like a sherpa to help them figure out their perk setup and gear loadout and maybe escort them through some tough quest spots?
---
Fires a 260 dmg exploding shotgun: only a ~7% health hit for the enemy.
---
Gets stung by a lvl 60 radscorpion: 25% health hit. 
---
Dafuq happened?!
---
just curious, where did this info come from?
---
If anyone builds anything interesting from this I would love to see it please pm if you do :)
---
Yeah I made that mistake when thinking the game was busted just after the beta - deleted the reserved space and lost all my early photomode pictures.  Sad times.
---
PSA: Go into photomode now and then, load each new photo and then take an xbox screenshot of the photo for actual-posterity.

Durabilty on energy weapons is still crap possibly even worst than before I got a 2 shot gatling laser yesterday from a Legendary Ghoul and it broke from 200% repaired before the first reload it was like 30 seconds of firing which is making energy weapons useless

Yea, after seeing how hard was last puzzle I got really exited in D2...until I saw its business model. To get latest dungeons I had to order DLC, no problem in there. But to order that DLC I first had to buy another DLC, that didn't even have latest content.
---
I LOVE that giant floating town/strangler thing and would love seeing more story about it. Having it "wake up" and become a monster when its nuked to give us a new option besides the Scorchbeast Queen is a fantastic idea.
---
No it was the actually community manager. He went on twitter and threatened players on several occasions.
---
Instance was when the yellow enemies in the light zone would drop something desirable. I forget what it was that they dropped, but they patched it within 48 hours. During that time, they threatened ban anyone that farmed it.
---
Another time was when the first Incursion with the APC came out. Everyone wanted the green set items, but the hardest difficulty was almost impossible unless you had god roll items.  
---
As a result lots of people found a wall glitch that made it somewhat easier.  I couldn’t find a game through match making where people weren’t using it. So I just went along with it because I wanted the drops. Community manager threatened to ban everyone using the wall glitch, but it never happened because too many people used it.
---
&gt; they also nerfed non-legendary explosive weapons (missile launcher, M79, etc.), which were trash to begin with,
---
I legit have never played with anyone using these weapons to begin with, due to how shitty they were.  Who thought "You know what, these need nerfed."   Are they even playing the same fucking game as us?  Hell, I shouldn't say "us," because I haven't played in over a month now.   Just check these forums in the hopes that it'll all turn around.  Not even sure why I bother at this point.  Seriously think I'm just going to uninstall and pull out ESO again.  Screw it.

Yeah but you ain't getting them shoulders you need anytime soon.  Pledge key grind life
---
I uninstalled last week and have been playing the Division and Diablo 3 to remind myself what good online game design looks like. It's great
---
Try a pure stealth sniper build it’s like an entire new game
---
I'm not angry about it being "harder" but I am upset about it being made more grindy and tedious. 
---
That's a spot I haven't seen nuked before. Any good mobs/drops?
---
i log in to sell stuff to vendors for caps and then log off and go play other games.
---
Not just even those, any game with multiplayer gets tweaked &amp; changed as time goes on.  I'm honestly at a bit of a loss about the people who act like this is a new thing or are all shocked &amp; disappointed
---
Yep.
---
If there was no cap limit there would be no loot in the world. Some people would just hoover all the junk in an area and sell it. It would make the current resource issues ten times worse.
---
It hasn’t been that long since the war, there should still be some planes or vertibirds that are useable for Manson to send a scouting unit over to Appalachia , I mean they did send the brotherhood out east in the future, perhaps some had to part ways and go to West Virginia instead (I do not recall what year BOS set out to DC) either way with them all being dead it makes sense as far as canon lore goes. 
---
It is sad if this is true, because on top of all else, it points towards a complete lack of understanding about their target market. 
---
Did you also find pie?
---
I totally agree.  Pest players ARE a problem in this game.  
---
Also, a 'true PvE' mode seems extremely simple to implement....either with dedicated PvE world instances or having a 'true pacifist' add on to 'pacifist' mode.  
---
Yes. Me too. I have to wait a whole minute or so. But sure enough, an empty body from a minute ago now has a legendary thing on it. 
---
OMG thank you.
---
Been saying this for so long.
---
The problem isn't just automatic weapons themselves, it's Bethesda's approach to enemy resistances and how that impacts high fire rate low damage weapons.
---
For some reason Fo4 and Fo76 has enemies that go up in damage resistances as well as health.
---
A lvl 50 scorched with no shirt has way more armor than a level 1 scorched with no shirt. As well as way more health. A high level super  mutant will take 10% damage when a visually identical lower level super  mutant will take five times that damage.
---
This is done across the board as each enemy variant gains health and DR and ER. Look at enemies in Fo76edit or Fo4edit/Creation Kit.
---
As DR exponentially reduces damage dealt, automatic weapons go from great early on to useless at higher level.
---
Bethesda should've completely rethought how they did damage resistances. There was no logic to it. DR was treated as a second health stat. DR is what causes most of the bullet-sponginess in late game, not health.
---
All that accomplishes is filtering out automatic weapons at higher levels.
---
The early Fo76 patch to make automatic weapons do +20% damage across the board was useless.
---
Furthermore damage resistance penetration doesn't work for energy weapons.
---
In the game files ballistic weapons deal regular damage, energy weapons are listed as dealing 0 damage but having an on-hit effect for spell damage of type energy.
---
The legendary anti-armor mod adds an enchantment, that adds an effect to  the player, that adds a perk, that uses an entry point function to mod target damage  resistance' and multiply it by 0.5. Perks such as stabilised also use this same entry point function. There is no entry point framework for target energy resistance modding. Fallout 4 had the same problem. Regular damage and spell damage are handled completely  differently, there is no way energy weapons could be given percentage-based resistance penetration.
---
It seems they balanced weapon dps against level 1 enemies with no DR. There are no late-game melee weapons except slow speed ones. Remember when you picked up the light machine gun for the first time, thought it was awesome, then actually fired it, then realised it was as useful as a water gun, then decided you'd never use it again? We all rode that rollercoaster.
---
Yes please! I either scrapped, or dropped my best piece of underarmor that I got from one of the BoS quests, and I can't craft it.  It's just gone  :(
---
That's exactly what I did and why I did it
---
I really hope they patch the damage on the chainsaw, it's just so pitiful right now. It looks amazing but it's just so bad. Maybe if there was a Berserker one it could match the Mr Handy buzzsaw at least.
---
Blame the dupers, if TSEs werent duped into oblivion they might not have even changed TSE, two shot, or explosive. 
---
I decided to do the slow route and waited on most quests till i was level 50. In the meanwhile, I have been exploring, building, learning plans, figuring out builds, farming, selling materials and just enjoying the game.   
---
It has been pretty buggy and frustrating a few times, especially base building, but continue on.   
---
It is slowly improving, with a few minor (major sometimes) hiccups. 
---
If memory serves, Destiny 1 &amp; 2 had this problem. With Bungie finding it difficult to find a balance between Buff's and Nerfs that didn't cheese off the fanbase. Additionally they've already got a full workload in fixing things. They'll get there, just not soon.
---
Further proof you're not even close to what you claim to be. It would put you close to my age. Only a teenager thinks 41 is old. Lmao.
---
Btw,thx for the yucks and screen shots,but my bowel movement had finished and your time to entertain me has come to a resounding (flushing water) close,sadly.
---
Try to shave that neck beard,get a job,move out of your parents house before 35 and contribute something to society.
---
Bye bye for now.
---
LOL!
---
Hmmm after that I’m not sure what you could do maybe role play? I’ve never done that thought so I’m not sure what it’s like
---
Haha i swapped 2 letters. Sorry!
---
I would like the ability to break enemy armor.     
---
To be honest, Armor does, and should, have an effect.  A rain of spitballs isn't going to do much damage until it breaks the armor, then it will start to hurt.  But if you hurl a boulder at them they're gonna feel it.  
---
But if you can somehow give enemy armor the same kind of durability that OUR armor has....and once its gone, suddenly the damage done by your minigun increases by 88.75%....Or maybe it slowly ramps up as the armor becomes less and less effective (that might be too much to ask for, but it would make the most sense).  
---
But I do agree.  The way DR works in the Bethesda games pretty much breaks high RoF, Low Dp/shot weapons.
---
Forgot the /s...
---
&gt;Honestly, I feel like they are pushing pvp WAY too hard. 
---
They have to. Without PVP the game lacks content and the atom shop won't work.
---
That's also why instead of mechanical overhauls the game desperately needs, they are teasing a pvp overhaul.
---
If a PVE oriented Fallout MMO wasn't expensive as hell initially and longterm, they'd have made that instead by now.
---
He’s kidding... right?
---
Not really, early Beth Fallouts and NV let you benefit from crit outside of VATS so you didn't just flat out gimp your damage massively because now you don't benefit from either VATS or crit bonuses/perks because you prefer not to use an auto-aim gimmick for doing optimal damage rather than for its supposed intended purpose of automatic aiming.
---
I'm level 200, i still like exploring and Pve, I have most of the newer games out right now and I just find myself going back to 76 more often then not, but then again If fallout 76 never came out ide just be playing fo4 survival mode still, which at level 100 is similar to endgame 76. 
---
Grafton, both the station and the bot in town sell combat armor stuff. 
---
\+party boy/girl and a drink of some booze, ups str quite a few points.
---
So it is true then that if a vendor, say Phoenix, sells an item, say Cooking Stove, then he should, in theory, have it 100% of the time?
---
Going from fallout 4 survival to this game was horrible. 4's survival mode makes everyone more lethal including the player. I really like how it cut down on bullet sponges.
---
What if they made the machines take pre-war money. Since... you know... they took prewar money before the bombs fell. That way ones in the world would still require you to pay with money.
---
My resource generation in camp for everything seems greatly reduced since patch 5
---
Have you tried to get a fully modded T-51b yet?  Doing it without buying any modded parts from other players is a pretty solid challenge, but now all the plans are available in the Super Duper Mart in Watoga so you have something to shoot for.
---
Add to that the somewhat hidden unofficial questline to get the Nuka Cola paintjob and you've got a decent challenge.
---
I figured once I saved up enough caps and bought all the plans that I'd be able to jump right into my new custom suit, but nope!  Takes a billion stable fluxes for each mod, so I've had to nuke specific places to try and get enough of the right raw components and it's been tough as hell so far.
---
Makes me immune to radiation too.  Get  radworms, walk into nuke zone, don't  worry  about radiation  damage.
---
It’s hard to have any optimism at this point.  I’m just so disappointed.  Bethesda turning the Fallout Franchise into this joke of a shit game is so infuriating.  How can a AAA company make so many bad decisions one after the other.  I expect a bad a launch from Bethesda, as well some patch and balance work.  This POS game is beyond repair.  It makes sad that they destroyed my favourite game.  I can’t even turn the game on anymore.  I just give up.  No bad words or mean things towards developers or company.  Just sad and disappointed.  It’s very over.  3-4 months and they give carry weight and nerfs.  
---
I've been using an explosive pump action shotgun for the last 150 levels, the difference between you and me is I didn't use it as a fucking crutch and only took it out for emergencies because I knew it was OP and would ruin the experience of actually playing the fucking game.
---
Give the server a minute to load it. I've been going back and checking empty bodies after several minutes. They load stuff into them really late.
---
Did they give ESO away?.... As I understood Beth has never had any involvement in ESO. ESO was made by Zenimax Online. Zenimax Online and Beth belong to Zenimax.
---
Accidentally scrapping a modded to death combat rifle is what pushed me into the online marketplace.  I hate accidentally scrapping a power armor frame.  There has to be a better way!
---
Honestly i spent most of my time in NV in vats mode cause i used bloody mess, so i best use the heck out of it. 
---
The really need to setup a player town or city where we can add items to sell.   
---
You just nailed the problem with modern online gaming. They turn up all the numbers to force players to turn it into a part time job. In many cases they allow you to buy your way past the grind wall. I can't tell if this game is better without that or not. 
---
I don't think 42 is old and I'm 33. I think that when you call doxxing a tween phrase it makes you sound 61 not 41. Doxxing has been around since I was a tween, dipshit.
---
We are talking a cost to a respec when we havent even got a reason. There is no drawbacks for everyone constantly respeccing.
---
Teenagers don't even fucking know what the elks Lodge is you stupid redneck.
---
Funny cause I was thinking of that exactly (plus the overall difficulty mod that lets you alter pretty much everything).  That H&amp;K was such an awesome mod.
---
Bingo, OP is getting jacked for sure
---
Man cannot steal what is given
---
It's not a nerf. It's definitely a bug. I ran into it several times. You can also clearly see it bugged when you are alone in your camp like I just was and stay in caution. Your healing factor mutation doesn't work and you have a steady caution until you relog. So maybe you are not really aware of the mechanics than or another platform don't have that bug or you did not run into it. I crouch 95% of the time. And I played a lot so there is no 2nd opinion about it!
---
Wonder what that new feature is, because it sure doesn't look like new content. Oh wait... could it be... a PvP mode? :/
---
Hmm yeah that is something I can work on, though my currently build doesn't even use power armour anymore. I've a fully moded X-01 already but I don't have the paint job. 
---
I'm can also try and hit the cap for caps, but I'm pretty close to that as well.
---
Your welcome bootlicker.
---
The thing that is most upsetting is they screwed up on what they were supposed to be good at, then compounded the problem by trying to include something they were bad at.
---
If you are using the submerged lamps to illuminate the boat, you should try the track lighting.  There are some flood lamps that are pretty bright.
---
Except the robots. They have, you know, sultry voices and great personalities.
---
Whom? Me? You? The Gingerbread Man? 
---
Is that PA designed to look like a Deathclaw or are a PA set meant to be placed on a deathclaw.
---
Both are cool as he'll but very different. Lol.
---
yeah this is real scary..the best thing to do is to actually favorite it thru the favorites menu. **not the pipboy..because if u drop it and ur bag is not there..goodbye..i try to be extremely careful with this i made a thread about how dropping items in the bags runs the risk of losing the item forever..happened to me while trying to give out ammo and modded weapons to fellow-wastelanders
---
I have a legendary blunderpuss with:
---
\+15% Reload Speed
---
\+25% Fire rate
---
50% Armor penetration
---
No worries, glad I could be of help. Hope Appalachia treats you well.
---
lol!
---
Going by the game's track record - it is going to suck
---
Modding weapons to a higher level....while silly IRL, makes sense in game.  Effectively it would be "repairing it to be better".  
---
I also agree, why is there that much of a difference between a level 5 Hunting Rifle and a level 50 one.  Why can't I, with my weapon station and gunsmith 5, repair my level 5 rifle to be a level 50 one (effectively at least).  
---
For that matter, why can't I craft Mods separate from the weapons they are on?  you can find them like that in the wild and at vendors, so in theory the ability to make them separately exists...but I can't make them?  
---
Why can't scrapper have levels, and give us the ability to remove mods from a weapon with a chance to destroy the weapon by doing so?  Give me the option when I look at a weapon to "Extract Mod"...or some such...and based on my INT and further modified by scrapper there's a chance of not only failing to get the mod, but reducing the weapon to junk in the process.  Heck, make the option itself require scrapper to be allowed.  You have to have that perk to even make the attempt, and your INT determines your chance of destroying the weapon.  
---
There's other things in the crafting system that I'd like to see changed.
---
Haha don't suppose you made the list, have you?
---
You may be very much so correct. Honestly, i have no idea the actual alignments. This was merely a suggestion. You have, obviously, been through more of the game than i have, and therefore I'll assume that you're probably correct.
---
However, being "semi-neutral" or previous allies does not rule out the possibility of making and conflict  My theory is based on the fact that, in my opinion at least, the responders and fire eaters represent what i take as self-ordained law enforcement and emergency services personnel. The raiders are naturally going to see them as a possible threat.
---
 The Free States are, to me, like a "sovereign citizen" group, who may also be averse to any group that may have any whiff of a desire to impose rules on them.  The raiders theoretically may align with such a group, as the may see them as being aligned against other groups trying to instill order over the land.
---
Just remember, those were examples, and not a statement of fact referring actual alignment. It was merely a thought. I could be way off base, for sure.
---
Standard.
---
These Deluxe editions etc. are there for big fans of the game or supporters, imo. 
---
The weapon skins are for poor weapons, emote is confusing, posters are ok and you can get other PA paint for the same armors in Atom Shop by simply playing the game.
---
You can, however, make your game Tricentennial on your account later by buying a Tricentennial edition and adding the code on your account, regardless you having the base game already.
---
The only problem I see with this is that the game is too clunky to be an actual FPS.  The random lag spikes and difficulty aiming properly would probably make me rage quit if the fighting was more intense.
---
I’d prefer a separate stash for junk only and then our normal stash be for all the real stuff we want to stored
---
actually tried those meds, didnt work for me. :/
---
I usually see it on resource generators as well, but Its happened with my purifier.  I only run 1 since I have more than enough water from running events and sell chems more than anything else.
---
A lot of ppl are in that boat. Melee/shotgun build will keep you afloat, but the changes make you do too much farming to upkeep ur crap items and makes getting fun items that much harder yo obtain. Tedious is infact the right word for this. And its sad. I love the idea of the game but i hate how they are managing it.
---
Fallout 4 survival mode did it pretty well. Enemies did more damage but so did the player. Worked really well. Just talking about survival on 4 makes me so sad about this game. Falliout 4 survival with coop is what I was hoping we would get. 
---
It's a way to artificially increase the game's length. My bet is that they were surprised that people had finished the game's content in a week and already wanted more. So on paper, making the game last longer mitigates the issue. In reality, it just makes it unrewarding and players stop playing.
---
That. and modders aren't able to produce mods that work to address specific issues.  I played a rifle/stealth build in Fo4 and only used one damage increasing mod, which was a buff to headshots so that most enemies (with the exception of deathclaws, mirelurks and the like) would be able to take two at best.  
---
Having to shoot a lvl 68 super mutant more than twice in the face to take it down seems absurd.  I know they're dumb as bricks, but if I destroy the brain stem or spinal cord, their heart will stop beating, their lungs will stop taking in air and they'll lose complete function of their limbs and die shortly after.  If I hit the cerebellum, (reptile brain) the same basic result happens.  They might be technically alive until they bleed out, but they're no longer a threat after losing coordinated motor function.  I can accept that I might have shot them in a non-vital part of the brain, or had the bullet glance off the skull the first shot, but shooting something humanoid in the brain should do more than take down 1/3 of their health.  I can accept that a scorchbeast might require quite a lot of work, because it's for all purposes an apocalyptic dragon.  I'd assume their bones are very dense, especially since they yield ultracite metal when breaking down.   I can also accept that a super mutant might have a very dense skeleton, but given that a .308 can easily punch through 1/4" steel plate and a .50 BMG is commonly used to destroy cover and disable car engines, I'm suspicious about the performance of slow firing/high velocity rifles in Fallout 76.  An anti-armor hunting rifle with a .50 cal receiver should be able to pass straight through a super mutant's head, even if he's wearing a cast iron pot for a helmet.  
---
Armor piercing explosive rounds exist in real life.  [Here's a TSE rifle in real life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkRyJCOuHc0)
---
Jetpack, hope on better jetpack and building mode
---
It gave me just over 5 minutes when I joined. I finished with maybe 30 seconds to spare with a fast melee weapon.
---
It'd be neat if the timer didn't start until the first player joined.
---
Yes, definitely give one of the DLC campaigns a try. My wife and I did Orsinium and it was fantastic! The more they update the game the more it feels like all the good bits of Skyrim.
---
What’s the point of having a spec at all if there’s no cost or downside? There must be some draw back or consequence to making a decision. I think the devs want more than just complaints and instead consider those with suggestions. 1000 caps wouldn’t be difficult to get in a weeks time and hooking it in to an in-game story element works.
---
[I'm a water dealer and it's been working great for me.   I have 8 industrial water purifiers making up to 5 waters each.  I sell for 5caps per water and routinely find myself with 40-50 waters making my rounds to the vendors.](https://i.redd.it/nza4m1j10ib21.gif)  
---
Litreally havnt touched the game since launch, was told to check in the new year - oh boy. What improvements are you talking about?
---
Once I worked on a game that had some hellacious problems... we had so few features built that we had a hard time making the playable content. We were really behind. 
---
So what did we do? We put all new feature development on a 6 month hold while we upgraded the engine to make the unplayable game *look better.* 
---
Point is, any smart OR stupid thing you can imagine them doing may be possible! All we can do is hang on... and keep bitching here. Hopefully it makes an impact on the right people. 
---
There's a thing....I can't remember which thread it was on...that basically discusses how mutliple purifiers give a diminishing return.  I dont remember the exact number but it worked to be something like 1 industrial and 1 small was about the most you could effectively run, more than that and you'd see a lot of wasted purifier power.
---
I would love to nuke some power plant and fight like 4 behemoths or a giant moth man or something. 
---
It’s definitely less as buggy, at least for me.
---
This must be the reason this game is plagued by trolls. Has gaming become so competitive that trolling other games is now normal customer acquisition?
---
Is this the equivalent of Walmart paying people to stand in front of Target and yell their opinion about how Walmart could teach Target a few lessons? 
---
Honestly it's part of the game and the only camps I've personally destroyed were at the back door of  the whitesprings golf clubhouse if your one of them you got what you deserved.
---
Note: I only destroy back door camps and then only if they have active turrets I leave everyone else alone I don't care if your there or not no one should have a camp there
---
Actually if your on xbox I can sell you mine.
---
This for me as well. I carry a torch of hope for the future of appalachia, but the fuel is running awful dry.
---
Beastly. Do you run as a cowboy?
---
You technically join all of them cause all you are doing is hacking into a computer and adding your name to the registry so you can access the secured containers. 
---
With the current patch yes though mods still rotate stock
---
I am surprised that the golf course isn't included in the no build zone.  Should be an easy fix for the devs if they didn't have 1243098574325 more pressing bugs and changes to address. 
---
Big hammer smash. Kill all. Fast. OP melle.
---
I have the same excess I had before the patch. So much lead and steel I have to dump it on the market. I did switch to melee though for farming some areas. You can one hit most things, saves bullets. The armor is getting fixed now though. My ballistic fiber is finally getting used.
---
If you're farming glowing, make sure to have glowing in perception. You must be pa if farming cores, there's cores around like the daily at camden park. When lower level was overloaded all the time, even now I need the calibrated excavator armor to jump around the map. The thing we had when low level is the scorch used to drop a lot of 308 and that helped a lot. Then converted the sniper to 50 receiver and saved some lead. Try melee, that's the way to go right now. Heck guys were doing melee I remember back when everything was op. 30 you should be grinding levels and your perks.
---
Yeah, I'm a melee build and my ranged weapon is a Gatling Gun for when I need to hit something at range. 
---
I keep and craft 50mm rounds, everything else I place in a bag on the road next to my camp. I'm really close to Vault 76 so my hopes is, some level 2 will have some ammo to experiment with.
---
Regardless, no point in holding on to ammo you don't have a use for. 
---
What are you playing on? I’m on PC. Is it something you can do solo? Or is it pretty casual?
---
Go with  it, man. I pulled a lvl 1 hunters leather left leg, a ghoul slayer leather right leg, and a lvl 1 armor piercing hunting rifle from the last time that happened to me.
---
Modded the crap out of em', crafted the rest of the lvl 1 leathers, and made some lucky 2nd level guy fresh out of the vault very happy.
---
I’m not trolling anything jack.  I have many hours invested in Fallout 76 up to level 100.  I love the game.  It’s commentary on a poorly planned boss fight SBQ vs how another game did it.  
---
It's the exit of a nuclear silo, cannot go in this side (had the same question weeks ago)
---
That happens to me all the time whenever a nuke zone resets.
---
Cool, but its still a very much empty, lifeless uninspired walking simulator that is choke full of broken bugs that keep getting reintroduced. 
---
How much do you get paid to post here?
---
The nuke silos have escape hatches and using them will take you to one.
---
You have talent, man
---
Marie Kondo it
---
Chill out little twit bitch
---
:/ 
---
Are they instanced? ive never seen anyone else down there.
---
No paper bag can be retrieved if it falls inside a harvest-able plant for example. Even if you harvest the plant it still takes precedent over the bag. Happened to me at the golf course.
---
I think the core of this post is being missed here. The loot in this game is to far and few between. Maybe not so in the Fallout lore but as gamers we are accustomed to games that throw buckets of loot when playing. Any Destiny player can relate. But its prevalent in so many other games as well. 
---
Once again. Another short coming for Bethesda and Fallout 76. 
---
Yes. It’s a cruel joke by Bethesda. After a nuke and the last bloated spawn, they turn to eyebots/Rad roaches/robots. 
---
When someone attacks my CAMP, I would simply like it if the system would show me the location of theirs so I can return the favor.
---
When you put a lot of effort into building a nice CAMP with lots of amenities it's not simple or cheap to fix it after someone destroys things, and more often than not someone else (a friend) collects their bounty before I can even switch off pacifist mode, there by making me wanted for retaliating against the original attacker.
---
There are so many things wrong with the PVP system in this game that it can't be covered within the Reddit Character limit, but Bethesda is more worried about banning players who crafted too many Stimpaks, than they are fixing this crap that irritates 98% of the players I've talked to.
---
no. You are not. Even if you are 100+ now the game is not fun anymore. Unless you are a melee char and that will probably be nerfed soon along the bloodied weapons. 
---
This post pretty succinctly lays out what is wrong with the game from a mechanics perspective. When you combine that with what is wrong with the game from a content perspective, it's pretty amazing that anyone can play this long enough to complete what little content there is.
---
On the bright side: Dupers are all doing fine, and some are even making a lot of money on eBay. Good decisions were clearly made for the honest fan base.
---
Reported wrong sub
---
Me neither, I have to fire a StimPack or eat a glowing steak or other food to force it to work again. The code routine is getting stuck and needs resetting I think by activating a similar code.
---
All a guess but seems to fit.
---
which mods send data out?  first I have heard of this.  most mods are simple .ba2 mods which are just packed with assets.
---
you may not be wrong about game issues from mods, but I have been modding bethesda games for many years and can't recall any that collect data.  
---
Hah! I never thought of just making someone's day that way!  
---
I'm not sure if they even played the game themselves before releasing it
---
Changing my build, rebuilding my camp, still trying to unlock all the power armor plans and get all the prime receivers.
---
Or selling. The MG42 fetches a nice haul at vendors. I don’t think it has any mods either that you can learn. 50 cal does though for the barrel I believe 
---
Inventory management is part of the game mechanics. You can craft items and then scrap them to learn plans. You can craft items and scrap them for XP. You can give unneeded items to new players, such as leaving them in the first Overseers cache. You can cherry pick and just collect items that give you relevant scrap once you have enough. Drugs and plans are easily sold for caps. Crafted items can be sold for caps. There are many ways to manage your inventory.
---
If you calculate damage using the FO4 formulas (which should apply to FO76) TSE is approximately equivalent to AAE for calculated damage (not the pip-boy damage which is "paper damage"). However, this assumes that explosive benefits from the AA modifier and this is not the case. AA does not appear to have any impact on explosive damage. So TS should do better than AA when we're talking about explosive damage. 
---
If you take explosive damage out of the equation, TS still outstrips AA by a very very very small margin. The only thing that you should be weary of is the fact that with TS you're not going to be able to use VATS.
---
If you are a VATS build, use B or AA weapons. Otherwise go with BE and TSE.
---
BuffAway has many unwanted effects...
---
Say NO to chems :)
---
 This game forces you to have the controlled Diogenes syndrome, which inculcated us the previous fallouts. 
---
I'm sure it will take longer than 45 minutes if you count every time it crashes and you have to reload.or the amount of time you put in at the final boss who can only be damaged by melee because all other weapons heal him to full health.its been months with zero dlc so I'm sure it will be at least an hours worth.
---
This game is a constant search for junk to maintain your weapons,armor and camp. Your not meant to hold onto these things. Your meant to constant be in need of them and be searching for them. That’s why they have the search function to highlight junk with a magnifying glass.  Too bad no one likes roaming around looking for junk to maintain thier items 
---
Who are you declaring this too? lol
---
I didn't use my explosive shotgun either. It wasn't much fun. I also had a TSE minigun that I never used because it wasn't much fun.
---
My 1* TS Handmade and my quad explosive radium rifle we're perfectly balanced and tons of fun to play with pre nerf.
---
 If you feel a gun makes the game too easy then don't use it. Problem solved.
---
There are only 2 reasons to cry about others using TSE......either you got owned in PvP and you are playing like a twit with a rifle build when players have armor.......or you are a degenerate gambler cheesing bit at the loot cave freaking out because you missed one legendary, in which case you should see a doctor about your addiction.
---
At first it only showed the 4 harpoons shots then it buffered then nothing.... I used my TSE shotgun on it so I would hope my shots were registered.  
---
I love the game and want to play it, but I get turned off by the constant inventory management, needing stimpaks, and being over encumbered.
---
I know it's a wasteland, but I'm still trying to play a game.
---
Har har har. It kept saying “find plans to build this object”. For some of them at least, like corn, carrot and gourd. So you know...I figured there were plans?
---
He attacked first the second I saw him I don't think that's an option
---
Very cool, thank you!
---
They seem pretty lackluster from my experimentation with them. You're right, pretty much IDENTICAL explosion animations. So far from my testing the Nuka grenades perform the best. I figured it would be the Nuka Quantum grenades seeing as how quantum is a more rare resource. . . But I found the Quantum grenades to be pretty lackluster as well.
---
Of course not.
---
It is the only way. Because we tried like every possible way to communicate the games faults and it fell all on deaf ears. They even made it worse by turning the game into grind only without benefit 
---
They aren't actually being removed. It's one of the many features that needs to be addressed. You are just seeing notifications for ammo or grenades you recently used. I forget what causes this to happen, but someone here will be able to explain exactly what's happening.
---
Long story short, don't sweat it, it's just errant text. 
---
Better than nothing
---
So this is why it feels like F76 is made by interns...But the thing Battlecry was at tight spot from the beginning. It was time when hero shooters became a thing and Overwatch, the PVP game, basically took that spot. Battlecry wasn't only game affected by Overwatch, every game that came into that genre died out or went from buy to play to free to play.
---
Thanks, I just don’t get why some have a lock symbol and say “find plans to build this”. Corn, gourd, and carrot are all locked 
---
It's been 2.5 months - they need to do both.
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Hey!  2 free Frisbees!  Win/win in my book.  
---
I agree with MrGlayden.  Don't fix the floating doors :)
---
Okay...
---
Your welcome
---
Good news they are making a pvp server option just like the wow servers. Well worse really because it drastically limits your respawn choices.
---
Stop my man it's a toxic relationship!
---
Weird. I once joined the event too late. Shot SBQ a couple of times, but it wasn't enough, I guess.
---
It's always amusing trying to get them to notice the tiny bag with a combination of emotes, flashing my pip boy, and squatting/jumping repeatedly. But it's nice getting the heart emotes when they finally figure it out.
---
They put the game out way too early with multiple bugs and balance issues. Players quickly learned how to max their efforts both inside and outside the rules. The developers are finally realizing what we've known all along and their solution since there's no new content to give us yet is change everything they can to try to slow our progression to a crawl.
---
I'm a 2H melee build with a Gatling Gun as my ranged weapon. Basically, I just try and unload rounds into her wings, since she's such a big target, the Gatling Gun registers a lot of hits. 
---
She will land, then I switch to my Executioners Super Sledge, once she drops below 40%, my hits start taking decent chunks of life per swing. 
---
But even as a melee you should carry a half decent ranged weapon. Even without perks the Gatling Gun does significant damage. 
---
PC player here.  I do this already with a side button on my mouse.  I have a really nice ghoul slaying knife with 40% attack speed and 40% damage below 50% health.  Makes really short work of WS ghouls.  I just stand at the door and auto swing.  I tend to get hit less with a fast attack 1 hander than I do an instigating sledge, even though it sometimes requires a second hit. 
---
Or maybe they just enjoyed the weekend?
---
Yeah. I’m pretty sure they will want to snuff those without the... Right Stuff for our... little Enclave. 
---
It’s actually a great argument for why the East Coast Brotherhood are hell-bent on ending the synth threat. All of the AIs in WV have ended up hacked or bugged in a way where they replaced their creators. MODUS is no exception. 
---
&gt; The main problem is that they make it harder for the levelling characters.
---
Just boil 1500 water. no biggie.
---
My biggest complaint is that our characters are sent on a mission to rebuild, but game mechanics for players working together to actually build something are missing from the game.
---
I love roaming the map and finding things.  I do not rush to blast zones to power level.  I explore and keep improving my CAMP.
---
I am annoyed by the bugs and glitches.
---
Only wish we as a community could build something out of materials that actually made a lasting difference.
---
It's really not that much harder. I'm still able to wreak havoc in West-Tek with a nerfed perk setup and a lever action rifle. Much more challenging than simply one shotting enemies. I think what's missing in this game that most grinding MMOs have is an auction house of some sort. There's instances in most MMOs where I just don't have the time to grind (work, real life etc) so I resort to buying posted items from other players. Hopefully the vending system helps. 
---
I stopped a while back hoping patches would fix this mess. I keep checking the sub every week hoping to see a change and not seeing it. It’s infuriating to play as it is. 
---
I found that plan very early on. I had no idea it was so rare. I usually just craft a bunch and sell to the vendors to hit my daily quota.
---
This. This is why I don't feel guilty about seriously overpowered weapons mods when I play FO4. NOTHING should be able to tank a 50 cal. Maybe a guy in power armor. **Maybe**. But when mole rats are sucking down shotgun shells like they're nothing, and dogs are shrugging off 44 rounds... your game isn't balanced. You have the shittiest parts of RPGs mixed in with the shittiest parts of shooters.
---
even so. Is an rpg not supposed to make you feel powerful after hundreds of hours invested? This is the point where this game fails now terribly. 
---
No, it's been too easy from the get go.  Being hard because you have to decide between crafting components and that big gun you want is not difficulty, it's annoyance.  I wish most enemies were harder except the scorchbeast, which needs to work more consistently.
---
Because players are leaving in droves and these tweaks make it look like players are engaged.
---
Would be nice, but not going to happen but if it does I guarantee the NPC dialogues will break the game fully
---
"takes four hits to kill a supermutant at level 30" 
---
Not to mention there's twenty more mutants and they're all flooding the first floor the moment the door handle turned 
---
5 ads in a ten minute video
---
Nope, once your stash is full you need to complain on reddit.
---
I know I'm just going to feel disappointed when the Vaults are just going to be dungeons you run and gun through, with no real lore, no real deep Mistress of Mysteries type of questlines, and no introduction of living NPCs to talk to and interact with.  I also think ppl are hyping the vaults up way too much. 
---
I am yet to start playing it, tried playing at Launch but it was way too unstable then and too buggy, was told on here that it will be fixed in the new year - got worse. So yh still waiting to start playing,
---
True that would be cool
---
Nope; I started play through FO3 for the first time. If shit gets fixed, I’ll come back. 
---
I agree with the word TEDIOUS.
---
I can't even play this tedious game because the servers keep lagging out and crashing......I'm on google fiber and I don't crash on bf5 EA 64 person servers so why can't this issue be fixed as well?  I'd rather play fo76 but the connection issues have been horrible lately.
---
I have had to respec from stealth sniper to melee due to my guns being completely ineffective now, my TS Gauss takes 6-8 hits to kill a lvl 68 feral but one hit from a power fist and it's dead, this is just lame, not to mention the hours I have to spend farming mats for ammo just to run 1 SBQ fight.
---
Wat....can’t wait to try this and move my crops indoors
---
not correct. Since it takes now a gazillion of bullets to kill an enemy. Also the poor dmg rates of ranged weapons is a huge problem 
---
Careful he might get nerf'd if you spread that around here too much.
---
I uninstalled the chat mod and the game seems far more stable. The other mods seem fine but chat seemed to cause more crashes. 
---
This has been an occurrence in the game since BETA iirc. And it's not actually removing said items from your inventory. To my knowledge for whatever reason when you loot a container, or sometimes when receiving loot it will show in the top left corner recently used ammo/grenades etc. Say for instance I recently shot 12 shotgun shells. Upon looting say a fusion core from a generator, it will pop up that I received 1 fusion core, and had 12 shotgun shells removed from my inventory. I think this happens when the server gets behind on calculating what you have on your person vs what you've recently used. But I'm not 100 on that.
---
I’ve been in an SBQ fight where one player did 80% of the damage (with a harpoon), and the rest of us, in comparison to the other player, did not do enough damage, so we got nothing. Well, except for harpoon ammo. The harpoon player shot down the SBQ in 4 shots, didn’t even let her regenerate. Although I thought the latest patch would stop the 4-shotting SBQ farmers so the rest of us could get a chance to damage her enough for a loot drop.
---
They forcibly limit collecting. You get to choose between collecting nuka cola quantems, that sweet legendary you're not high enough to use, or materials to keep yourself in working armor/weapons.
---
nanaboostme is #gamerstrong you tell em bruther
---
I get around not repairing armor all the time is to be in PA when I enter a new location expecting a surge of bad guys. I find my PA takes forever to break. I do hate the HUD in PA and the clumsiness. Jumping and getting stuck on geometry is frustrating.  I use the workshops to make 6-10 fusion cores and then I"m good for a few weeks of play time. Unfortunately, capturing the workshops at the power plants takes an hour plus defending a few times. Definitely grindy, but not terribly difficult. I started around Xmas and level 52. 
---
I already see gamers being payed to play this train wreck this game has become since the „fixes“
---
Yes in fact I've done it twice; the second time just 'cause I was in the area and bored.
---
It will be very very close but it's entirely possible - I even did it as melee chasing around the fireflies.
---
It helps a LOT if the rad toads spawn as they drop extra fluids.
---
The Anthem boss was literally a bullet sponge that spawned waves every now and then. It in no way took coordination. Granted it was more fun to fight because it didn't just hurl blue stuff at your screen making it impossible to see, but I'd hardly say it had any real mechanics besides "shoot big thing, now shoot little things if you feel like it, repeat." 
---
Piss off with the calls to nerf everything, the games already tedious enough without merging more of the fun. 
---
This made absolutely no difference whatsoever.
---
&gt;collectables impossible to collect due weight limitations...
---
And you can't even display your collectables.
---
Yeah this is bullshit. Is it the harpoon gun now? Had the same thing happen, although I think the guy had a gauss or something. We should be able to just tag the enemy to get loot. That would prevent this nonsense. 
---
So true. I took a break from Destiny 2 to play FO76. I'm not sure I really took a break! I heard the Last Word is back. So tempting to back to that grind.  Maybe Far Cry New Dawn will be a better grind.
---
MIght've tried to. . . But unfortunately everytime I've tried to boot up the demo it's told be it can't connect to the servers. So. . . No Anthem for me. Back to add to my 350+ hours of 76 I guess, works for me. 
---
Am I misunderstanding the OP. But the reason it doesn’t have it is because it’s too expensive? And too many hoops to jump through. So instead of making a quality product they cheap out and remove it from the game?
---
And?
---
You really want them to change the whole coding? There’s a reason there is a limit, just learn to manage your stash better ;-)
---
It's headed to that drop
---
The fans here have a problem with Bethesda because they are so terribly disconnected with the community. Every patch makes things worse. THAT is the problem. 
---
If you would have taken 5 mins to read the posts here you would have known that
---
Me too, cuz Fallout was never about pvp but about exploration and questing and, in recent time, building.
---
This is clearly a bug and not intended... when you have to jump through that many hoops.
---
Probably safe to do, but expect Bethesda to fix it ^((one day in a distant future))
---
Yeah I've encountered a few bugs since I've been playing. But nothing that's made me want to break the disk and come on Reddit and complain.
---
Only had maybe four or five disconnects the whole time I've played. And a few times I really think it was my friends internet.
---
I've said this before, but it seems like most of the hate is coming from people who've been playing since day one and have put about 500 hours into it already.
---
Me and my friends play it, and we take our time trying to get a feel for everything. And we may be only in level 20 to 30. But we're really enjoying it. A small 1% of the people hurried up and rush to get the biggest and baddest levels and weapons and now they're disappointed.
---
Two of the main people I play with have played all the other Fallout. And they seem to really enjoy this one. And me, I've never played a Fallout in my life.
---
I'd prefer being able to display them in racks. Would settle for naming them.
---
But what exactly IS her story? Is she Rosalyn's personality downloaded into the Ms Nanny a la Chappie, or did Rosalyn actually reprogram her with her personality and voice? THAT is what I'd like to read/see/hear in the game. 
---
If the company disputes it and you lose the arbitration, etc., it can turn into them suing you or accusing you of theft or adverse comments on your report.
---
It's unlikely you'd win this case if you've played a substantial amount of time.
---
And start unbanning accounts of people who havent done anything wrong to begin with but that's what you get when you allow a robot to ban over half your player basis and then have everyone have to wait for a real life agent for over 3 months to click a button and unban you this game is trash 
---
😂
---
Let's be real. There's no text cus Bethesda didn't care about it.
---
I bought it because I love the other Fallouts (and it was only £20).
---
For me, Fallout 76 feels very similar to previous Fallouts, but with a chunk of content missing and a multiplayer aspect tacked on for no reason. 
---
Soon people will get a copy after buying a soda or a gum in a market...
---
Fallout 76 might end up like E.T. for Atari...
---
If they introduce "proper pvp" where you don't have to ask players to engage, they HAVE to introduce a reputation system to discourage shooting on sight.
---
Look at Dayz (old dayz, the mod) where there were bandits and hero's. And they got nice skins to show off their alignment. And there was no penalty to shooting a bandit, but shooting anyone who wasn't a bandit would cause you to become a bandit yourself, so there would be 2 camps, sort of.
---
I HOPE this is something Bethesda does, because it would be really interesting, and it would potentially avoid people just shooting on sight.
---
For sure!!
---
I think you're getting jacked,  homeboy. 
---
What exactly is the point of this? Foundations have an invisible ramp on every side. 
---
&gt; level 52
---
So yeah you're at the point where you can use White Knight (even if it's nerfed, 60% is better than 0%) and you can also just fast travel to the locations rich in ballistic fibre. This shouldn't be a problem to you.
---
That's an interesting suggestion because it doesn't change the economy, just makes it more casual friendly. I kinda like it...but still want the base per day to be higher.
---
In my opinion, FO4 struck a nice balance between the challenges of resource acquisition/management and enjoying memorable story lines with companions.
---
FO76 has turned the resource-related tasks into excessive tedium and eliminated the memorable story lines.  And, of course, 76 comes with a wider diversity of more frequent bugs.
---
My current approach to attempting to enjoy this game is to experiment with different C.A.M.P. locations in the hope of finding fresh experiences.  I grow enough corn to survive on the Corn Soup diet, cook it up, and then go fast traveling with an eye for interesting places with “interesting” neighbors.  
---
It’s a shame that the only tool Bethesda used to determine “beta readiness” was a wall calendar. 
---
Thanks! I work until 3 pm cst. No rush.
---
Not really. I think it should actually be much harder in the late difficulty wise, but our collected materials should make up for that.
---
Read the fucking thread. He's trying to stir up shit crying that Bethesda is nerfing the base damage of weapons to make the game grinder and then finally admits he's pissed off that they nerfed his tse. 
---
Yeah, you'd think on the quantums, eh?
---
How hard are you finding to get the supplies for nuke grenades? I've not found the plans for them yet, so haven't paid close attention.
---
Lol yeah he was hard when I was below 50. His gun can eat you up quick if you don't know what to do. If you don't have a gun, the mistress of mystery quest has the voice of set.
---
it is much more than a walking simulator.
---
It is blank because nobody has tested the scaling is the same. Everybody does not *know* it is the same. They *assume* it is the same.
---
Beth has acknowledged this and put it on their list of upcoming patches. 
---
You have to reeeeeaaaallly not care about aesthetics to do it. The crops and purifier float way above the campfire. It looks like ass.
---
To date they have demonstrated they are completely out of touch with their players. If PvP in the game is so popular, why is it that in three months I have seen hunters versus hunted pop up less than 5 times?
---
Awesome
---
rip im on PC
---
no but you can log out
---
This is just the Destiny problem, all over again (with less stability) - major problems, bad balancing, drought of content. Then waiting for the already-finished-months-ago DLC to save the day, but it's anemic and short, and really not worth the costs, nor does it fix much of what was wrong - the designers always have big blind spots to the game flaws and instead berate the customer for not playing a certain way. These DLC will be a short joke, unfortunately. Until they double down and take people off other projects to make 'comet' content or off-DLC content, this game will have the same low number of new things to do for at least 6-8 months. 
---
More like fire 12 shots and when they run up to your face because they're still alive after 12 shots of explosive buckshot you need to switch weapons or you one shot blow yourself up.
---
It is no longer more powerful than my furious handmade or antiarmor combat rifle, in fact all its decent for is aoe damage on multiple enemies from the explosions which now hit enemies like little playful waves from a calm ocean.  Even level 50-60 ghouls take 8 explosive shots just fine now.  I shouldn't need 9 points of shotgunner to make an explosive shotgun **semi** decent.  I need 9 points of nonauto rifle perks just to make my handmade deal enough damage with sneak bonus to play this game, even with those shotgun perks my tse combat shotgun is so shitty compared to what it used to be like that it's actually insulting that I wasted time farming for it over other items that in retrospect I now would've preferred.
---
At least my plasma grenades still do some decent damage.
---
I don't mind the TSEs being nerfed some, but they took it to far. I don't mind the game overall being made a little harder, but having to fix my guns after being repaired to 200% after 4-5 mags is to much, having to eat like more than michael phelps is to much, my Power Armor protecting less than normal armor, its not fun anymore.
---
Wait, you can get paid to post here? That’ll go nicely with my Soros pay-checks. Where do I sign up?
---
I think the mg42 has a few, I know the one I got from a trade has some but I honestly can't remember what because I'm not on right now. Yeah the 50 only has the large barrel. 
---
QA/QC is essentially playing the same level, part of a level, or quest dozens if not hundreds of times and trying to break it in some way. 
---
They don’t get a chance, like you said, to play the game by design or as intended. That’s not their job function. 
---
They see what could be wrong with “Level” 2, Section 4. They don’t know little Johnny can scrap his Power Armor by accident. It’s not ignorance of the problem, it may be that, that particular tester DOESN’T actually know it’s a problem without looking at their Trello or Jira workflow board.
---
Also, another thing to keep in mind is their QA/QC may be 50-75 people at best, even less when broken regionally. Hundreds and thousands of players in a live environment will find a lot more things wrong in a couple of hours than a few dozen people.
---
I have been waiting on a reply after being banned. I have replied to a support ticket and an earlier email pertaining to the nature of the ban. 
---
I have since sent a private DM to LoneVaultWanderer with no reply. 
---
Granted I did take advantage of a messed system to lighten the load of “survival” to better enjoy puttering around in the wasteland with friends... in an almost unplayable game :( I have loved Bethesda for half my life. I am a filthy casual I’ll admit. I am not some scalper selling rare or unreleased items on eBay. Just an average person trying to make due with the very little that Bethesda gave us in fo76 to enjoy. 
---
I am also a consumer who paid money not only for a product I no longer even have access to but also extra digital items that I purchased to further support the continued efforts of Bethesda to make this game something. 
---
Just give me my game back... take my character and my stash but allow me to retain goods purchased by actual money that I have to work to obtain. 
---
I have been crazy supportive of this title and promoted it to anyone who would listen. Give Bethesda a chance. They haven’t done us wrong in the past.... 
---
This makes sense except now I get to this state 80% of the time. Does it mean there are that many dupers on the servers that I’d encounter them so often?
---
It is not being made harder but instead the game's entire balance is just a mess. Pulling godlike double shot explosive weapons back to the ground was a necessary move. However, I am not a fan of the durability either. They should have gone for making obtaining armor harder but having no limitations or vulnerabilities on them. But I guess they could not do it because that would make alot of perk cards obsolete.
---
I was running down into VTU for the first time and came across the Vault Simulation there. I stopped at the doorway with the stairs looking down. I could see images of all of the fo4 vaults flashing before my eyes. I did a quick inventory and checked my water and food resources, carry weight, ammo, and stims. I said nah, I'm gonna have to come back since I'm low on a few things. 
---
I recruited my brother to hit the simulation with me and it took us about 10 minutes to clear the entire simulation. I just had to laugh at myself. Lol. I could see the next few vaults being like this. 
---
But if they were smart about it, they would have tiers in the vault which open and close weekly with separate mission requirements. But they will be super congested the first month of the release. 
---
The thing about melee is that you have to get up close and personal to make your hits. Yes, that super sledge might be whacking at 168 a swing, but you're taking a beating while getting in those hits.  Ranged weapons--as implied by the name itself--allows you to attack from a distance. You might not necessarily be safe but you're *safer* and your armor/health isn't being battered as badly.
---
That’s why MODUS remarks about understanding why you wished to join them after having the Kovacs connection restored. The previous human interaction with them went... poorly. Once they can see how far the SB have spread it starts making sense. 
---
MODUS still doesn’t care about whether you do anything about the SB or not though. At least that’s my take on them. 
---
Dude you are not doing perks right. I can shoot my tse combat shotgun in somethings face and i take NO damage. You need to use fireproof perk. 
---
You obviously do NoT know what you are doing. And instead of learning , you are trashing the game amd bashing things for no reason
---
Go around one or two hitting all the things with one gun, suddenly you encounter something that takes near zero damage from that gun. Switch between the six guns you have and you don't have the right gun on you to kill this creature.
---
Log out in frustration when it calls four of it's friends over, you have six guns on you and full ammo but can't damage any of them below 20% without using all your stimpacks.
---
So much fun.
---
I've only seen the Flatwoods monster 4 times and killed it three times.  I agree the loot is entirely unremarkable.  I've seen it actually near Flatwoods, (my one fail because I was way underlevel to kill a lvl 50 enemy.  It just shot off into the air after my first hit and disappeared) twice on the bridge at Seneca Rocks, and once in the Mire.  The latest kill in the Mire it didn't have a helmet, just an alien head with large goggles on.
---
For how rare the Flatwoods Monster and Mothman are, it would be cool if they were always at least a 1-star legendary.  I can count on two hands the amount of mothmen and Flatwoods critters I've come across, and I've been playing daily since beta day one.
---
you know why? Because the people having enough power to do something have no motivation in taking her down. It now cost way too many resources that are not worth spending. 
---
Thank Bethesda for finally killing their own game with pointless nerfs 
---
Some legendary armor gives 20 percent weapon weight reduction across the board. Really nice if you can find it.
---
I'm sure with Bethesda reasoning if they raised the daily cap limit they'd also raise the prices of everything that's available by whatever percent they raised the daily caps 🤷
---
This is the correct answer.
---
It's bad when they just screw up balance more and make the game super grindy. The point of a fallout game is not grinding 
---
Honestly I would come. Back to the game if I could respect from lvl one. Since they nerfed two shot explosives I'm to weak to go anywhere. So I gave up on the game. 
---
they drop lead and aluminium...get that loot!!
---
If they are unlocked then players might be stealing from them.
---
Otherwise they have a limit of 5 and only 1 unit of water gets generated for the whole camp at a time. 
---
You have to use a public workshop to get the full rate. 
---
I feel like changing it to a system more in line with what League of Legends does could be good. There, armor and magic resist work as “effective HP” wherein every 100 points of armor effective doubles your HP (ie 100 armor reduces damage by 50%, 200 armor reduces it by 66% etc). That way super high DR is still effective against high damage weapons but low damage weapons can still have high DPS and can mow down low armor targets instead of being negated by something with like 25 DR. Obviously the exact numbers could be tweaked but I feel like this could be very helpful 
---
I was expecting a regular power armor setup with Death Claw parts attached on it all over the place just like the Raider power armor does in its style.
---
It seems that bethesda can’t do anything anymore without someone getting mad about it, even not tweeting for two days. Come on. 
---
you've clearly never played Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. Poser, lol
---
Ballistic Fibre is either too rare or armor repairs require too much of it...
---
The thing is, when I play my stealth character I rarely even need repairs because I don't get hit. But if I play a non stealth focused build like heavy gunner it breaks so quickly that I literally can't keep it repaired and as a consequence I die really quickly because I'm naked. They just didn't test this game properly in the balancing phase... 
---
Not hard at all really. But I'm always checking the nuka coolers when I'm vendor hopping, and I don't know if it's that my luck is 11 or it's just random, but I frequently am finding fully stocked coolers. And raider corpses have a high % rate of frags on their corpses. So I'm usually rolling with at least 5 nuka grenades on my person. Sometimes 10-15. But I also use Super Duper perk when I craft them. So that leads to a lot of double crafts.
---
So what are you suggesting doing instead? I see you're saying DR isn't working but I'm not sure what you're suggesting it's replaced with or how you think it should be reworked.
---
Or is that the point? (Starting the conversation)
---
Haven't noticed. Hows you cpu load, bottle necking? What I do notice is the delay from sprinting to the first and follow swing.
---
Those things are brutal. 
---
I start it while running into them. It takes a little longer to power strike. The network lag is real too. Depends on the server but sometimes even with rifles, get a delayed kill.
---
It’s Jason 
---
By "all previous Fallouts" you mean just 4 right?
---
it wont allow u to spawn back if ur in a nuke zone..u have to choose somewhere outside of the zone
---
if you want opinions from people who actually play the game go ask r/fo76FilthyCasuals. 
---
GET BUILDING AWESOME CREATIONS BEFORE BETHESDA STOP OUR FUN!
---
I hope this works because I sat there staring at a SBQ corpse for what felt like five minutes yesterday.
---
You got loot? must be nice, when I killed him he just T-posed and was unlootable
---
I went from playing 6-8 hours a day(I'm unemployed) to maybe 2 a day just to see what dailies are working and get them done and to run the vendor circuit, my explosive .45 machinegun breaks after just 3 clips and barely damages what I'm shooting at, a lvl 80 Scortch beast will barely show the damage from a full clip.
---
Can only paint the T-51b with the Nuka paint.  I too have a fully modded X-01, just looking for something fun to occupy me for at least a week
---
Go around scavenging for material &gt; use required materials for crafting/repairing items &gt; bulk remaining material and sell unnecessary quantities &gt; repeat to increase cap stash &gt; head over to Fallout market to buy better gear &gt; repeat process.
---
Also top of the monorail elevator great place for cement 
---
Do you run with vsync and AA? Those usually contribute to input lag. 
---
Lol. Pay attention to what they've been actually doing the last 3 months then. It kinda looks like just asking for serious bug fixes and for them to NOT nerf weapons is way too crazy for the Devs to be able to handle. 
---
Was definitely thinking of DC-themed PA on a human.
---
Yeah pretty much, start building to get rid of stuff, not sure of the state of bulking, but bulking generally brings it down by 50lbs but bulking may still be broken.
---
Build stuff at your camp to use materials, sell materials that you have too much of or don't use like bones, cork, cloth etc ..
---
I have 2 xboxes and 10 characters, so I move stuff around, so I take all my junk from my first character and give it to another, I am already maxing out my other characters with just junk mostly, I need to start building big camps for all of them .. 
---
Make sure you scrapping everything and pull stuff out of your stash which is not scrapped.
---
Toss any 1 star or no star weapons or sell them ..  I would love to keep everything but we can't .. I also only keep junk in my stash and everything else on me which can't be dropped when I die, even my main characters are carrying also 2000 lbs, the 1500 lbs max limit is very aggravating and stupid, but I understand why it is in place ..
---
Too expensive still lol
---
Yup, plus garden gnomes give cement so make sure you pick them up.
---
Also 4 bags on the West Bridge or whatever it is called near Flatwoods at the top in the middle.
---
I really think this part of the story is just setting the stage for something bigger. They hyped the factions up before release, and laid the groundwork for refounding them. I think the first major content or chapter or season or whatever, will introduce NPCs who we as players will use to rebuild the factions. I wouldnt be surprised if we took back major towns and hubs to establish as HQs for the factions.
---
As for the BoS, you could have people find recordings of Maxson and buy into his philosophy, and want to live it. You could also have people who were either military or descendants of military, who see the BoS as the next best thing, since the BoS was founded and consisted primarily of veterans. You could also have people who were patriotic and believed in the "good" ideal of America, and not the crazy corrupt Enclave. The rank and file service members, low level federal employees, etc who werent part of the crazy high up Enclave lunacy, and just loved their country and wanted to serve.
---
Remember, the whole of American government wasnt Enclave. The Enclave was the super secret, super high ranked movers and shakers who pulled the strings behind the scenes. The average soldier or federal employee probably wasnt totally crazy evil fascist. I imagine the people who believed in America but werent part of the secret Elite, might see the BoS as the next best thing. 
---
Yes, the Responders are still substantially better than the BoS, and dont need an existential threat to be relevant. But remember, there was a brief time early on before the Scorchbeasts appeared, that the Brotherhood of Steel actually seemed benevolent. They cleared out the super mutants in Huntersville, and helped push back the raiders in the Savage Divide. It was only as time went on and the Scorched became an increasing threat that the BoS shifted towards dickishness, but after going through Cranberry Bog it makes sense. They took it upon themselves to hold back the Scorched, and were faced with the dawning realization that they were doomed.
---
The hardest faction I see repopulating is the Free States, since besides living in isolated bunkers and being kind of independent, their philosophy is basically what everyone has to live by in the wastes. Self reliance, self governance, and taking your survival into your own hands. 
---
This could change if the Enclave were to become ascendant, and establish itself as the main government power in west virginia. If say the Responders reformed and started spreading out, and the Enclave declared them part of the new US, then started sending cargobots to drop supplies for the survivors. If suppose Enclave troopers started patrolling the roads, exterminating mutants and basically forming a peacekeeping presence, well suddenly they look like saviors. Maybe they disappear people who speak out against them, or they demand conscripts or raw materials as "taxes" or whatever. Kind of like what Colonel Autumn wanted at the end of Fallout 3.
---
If the Enclave became the "savior" of West Virginia, I could see groups being suspicious or finding out how all this crap happened and not trusting them. These people, not crazy or evil enough to be raiders, but tough and independent enough to not accept the Enclave, could easily move into the Mire and refound the Free States. 
---
The Mire is actually the perfect place to form an anti-Enclave zone. The natural environment strongly favors lightly armored, mobile infantry. Realistically the swamps and bogs would be hell to navigate in heavy powered armor (much like the way the war in China started to slow down because of the terrain) and the dense canopy would make aerial and orbital surveillance and scanning very difficult. Add in all the deadly wildlife and a knowledge of the terrain, and the Mire could turn into a hellish quagmire reminiscent of Vietnam. Sure the Enclave could probably expend all their munitions carpet bombing it, but that would pretty much exhaust their advantage over the region as a whole.
---
You can also make your own fertilizer by letting your food spoil. Then go craft raw fertilizer. No need to waste caps on going over to the west side of the map.
---
My personal opinion is that the game is costing too much to upkeep compared to not enough sales. They want people to leave the game so they can just axe it due to not enough players. 
---
So they are making it so annoying and tedious to dissuade people from playing.
---
It’s one thing to stop support due to low sales it’s another if the player base is gone. 
---
I am giving them 1 more chance to redeem themselves, ROADMAP, if we don’t get this by the months end, I am out. We need to know what their plans are for future content releases, not just PVP. ..More end game content, expand on the overseer’s quest.. SOMETHING! 
---
I run around with pacifist mode on all the time to avoid accidental pvp. I do claim the occasional workshop for a fast travel point, but if someone tries to claim it from me I just log off the server. Same if they run in during the defend mission. This happens a lot, and they have not once been there to help defend. They just want to kill me in pacifist mode for the easy caps.
---
Anyone who does that just ends up on my block list. Not worth getting upset about it or anything. Junk is easy to replace and I just make sure I always stash my flux and such. I gain a minimum of 1400 caps a day, so the 120 they got off of me doesn't matter much.
---
I also stopped building up the workshops to make them nice for anyone who happens by or gets them after I log off.  The PVP enthusiasts (not griefers) see a high level taking a workshop and come running.
---
Yes you can get a quad or double ammo capacity modifier on a blackpowder weapon. 
---
that is the worst..ppl have no etiquette..if im in the WS area..i will try to remember to throw the hazmat on before logging off..but my camp is not far from there i need to get into the habit of always going back to my camp
---
Take it slow and have fun. Ignore toxic comments and players. Look for brown bags dropped by players for new players. 
---
Yeah been around since I been playing. Sometimes if you fire off rounds it gets reported later xx rounds removed from inventory in the upper left. I don't know why.
---
I didn’t stop to count bugs; as far as I’m concerned, the Anthem demo only had one single issue: being boring. It was like Destiny remade by people who don’t *get* Destiny, and I say this as a Bioware fanboy. 
---
FO76 may have more bugs and balance issues, but I’m extremely forgiving of bugs when I’m having fun. 
---
Mutations do add a lot of dmg. Also you should check bloodied legendários.  You can thank me when you reach 900 +
---
Except their parent company runs Elder Scrolls Online and Todd himself said they had hands-on help from Zenimax Online while working on 76. It’s not like they don’t have the resources at their fingertips. Also, there are hundreds of both successful and failed online games to look at from the outside and say okay, they did this well, they did this poorly, let’s learn from that and apply that knowledge to our own game — which is something (good) devs do _all the time_.
---
So genuine question, not snark: what makes them worthy of such overly generous excuses like ‘growing pains’ in your mind? I just can’t see it, myself. 
---
I'm going to start by saying, yes, the game needs better balancing, and the bugs need to be fixed ASAP
---
To the OP: sure, they can give everyone a free pass to reallocate.. but what happens after the next weapon balancing? complaints again? This is a very common practice for online games. Some online games even nerf/balance/tweak stuff years later. Their overall goal is to make it so that everything evens out, a little at a time. Melee will get its day, and so will sentinel/cavalier armor.
---
Example: Borderlands 2 had the conference call shotgun and bee shield.. people could take down ALL bosses, other players, and enemies within seconds. Word hit Youtube, forums, and the internet in general.. Soon after, everyone was grinding/duplicating the stuff. Word quickly got back to Take 2/Gearbox, and it was nerfed. I've also played MMOs that nerfed entire character builds, because, on average, they were showing higher on the leaderboards/damage boards in PVP and PVE. 
---
It's just what happens. I'm level 117, and have about 30 unallocated points, because I was expecting all of this.
---
Just drop all the junk you don't need, like all those hundreds of asbestos and anything else you don't use. Gathering a needed amount will be faster than micromanage junk you MIGHT need if you switch weapons/armor. 
---
&gt;  This would honestly help us and help the game dramatically with its  replayability. no one in their right mind is just going to level another 50 levels to change all those points 
---
I don't know at what school you were though **mathematics**, but it surely was not an expensive school. Most people only need to level up a couple of times to get to the SPECIAL build they really want. Every time you level up and choose to respec, you can move one of your points. Subtract it from one trait, and add it to another trait.
---
Let me give an example. Suppose this is your initial build, without having respecced:
---
S 12
---
P 11
---
E 8
---
C 6
---
I 7
---
A 7
---
L 5
---
We can change that build, to a very very different build:
---
S 8
---
P 7
---
E 7
---
C 7
---
I 9
---
A 9
---
L 9
---
**Four** less strength, **four** less perception, **one** less endurance, **one** more charisma, **two** more intelligence, **two** more agility, and **four** more luck.
---
As you can see, every stat has changed. It's **EIGHTEEN CHANGES** in total, but that only requires **NINE** respecs. Since only 9 respecs are required, you only have to level up 9 times to get to desired build. And the desired build, in this case, was very different from the initial build.
---
I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news.
---
It did? I thought it was boring and trivial. Preferred the earlier boss fight in one of the missions, although that would probably have been trivial too if I'd figured out how to use the ultimate.
---
SBQs are still fun, now that they don't drop to TSEs within a couple of minutes.
---
Oh yeah I'm normaly a slow player lol I never rush to say endgame. I'll be on the look out for these bags though thank you :)
---
And at the same time if you loot a few things and then get stuck on this you can actually watch your current carry weight updating itself as it slowly ticks upwards. Their inventory optimization is NOT good.
---
Just found it yesterday and now I'm actually debating rerolling a pistol build. ;)
---
I’ve reached the point where I’ve bought most of the relevant mods for my character, except the gauss rifle plans on my second character due to outrageous price hikes. I’ve quit fast traveling. And I just run around naked with a death claw gauntlet. Players die, camps die, I die, it’s a great time.
---
EVERY FUCKING UPDATE MINE RESET! I’ve talked to the LoneWanderer guy a little after launch and he said they’d look into it or pass it along. Nothing as changed. Just do what I do and screenshot them on Xbox as well.
---
Yeah, it's nothing, single area, single quest, every human long dead:  
---
Warning: this datamine from the game itself. Most likely all this will appear in FO76 in the future, but it's not guaranteed! Manage your expectations accordingly.
---
Introduction: so as we already know, the sealed vaults will be in next DLC of FO76. What kind of content it will be? It will be group content, according to the terminals near their entrances(this terminals available to everyone to check).
---
My speculations, according to my datamine, they will be time based, with a reward in the end also i think it will be with leaderboard, but its just my speculation

**VAULT 63**
---
Mission of the Vault - unknown
---
Background - disaster due to fire and smoke, i found few dead bodies only, probably all inhabitants was turned into scorcheds or smthing, i dont know yet because there is no enemies at the moment, but a lot junk to loot. We will have a quest to repair Anti-Fire system and ventilation, and then re-launch core nuclear generator, i suppose this disaster happened probably due mole miners, because we can see few tunnels, they lead to the small mine tunnel, with dead-end, fire and smoke pit in the end with radiation

**VAULT 94**
---
Mission of the Vault - seed bank and agricultural facility
---
Background - disaster due to unknown reasons, i found few terminals with lore of that place, like their vote system, yet no enemies, but a lot locked containers to loot and plants to harvest. We will have a quest to repair/restore inner Greenhouse system there, i suppose
---
[https://imgur.com/a/OoAllGB](https://imgur.com/a/OoAllGB)

**VAULT 96**
---
Mission of the Vault - core fauna embryos bank
---
Background - its most complete background from all datamine, as you can see from pictures - disaster due to mutation of fauna forms.
---
And in the end of this dungeon there is a terminal with elevator, where you can complete mission, and you will see weird words **NICE WORK ASSHOLES**
---
lol, its for dataminers or? why Bethesda SWEARS ON PLAYERS? Also there is actually some enemies inside, mostly mirelurks, without any bosses Also i found a lot syringers and armory room with full of weapons and ammo, incl minigun and missile launcher
---

---
&gt;  Do you really think either of those would be better, more immersive, more compelling storytelling?
---
It could be if you make it so. Obviously in the main story quest this could be a problem but if there were NPCs that gave quests that were one time deals and you chose to say outright kill that NPC then you forfeit the potential quest rewards for the rest of your characters time but you could possibly loot a rare weapon or armor piece.
---
This could also be done for main story quests but maybe put a retry timer on the quest that lock you out of it till the next week or day depending on the severity of the failure.
---
Yeah I've seen and heard about people who deserve to have their camps wrecked. But my camp and myself haven't done anything to deserve the way it's been cleared. 
---
Nope it does not.
---
I feel your pain. We all do. Even though the game was far from perfect it had potential. 
---
I think you just need to find carrots, gourd and corn and then it will allow you. You only need plans for the Brahmin Pen which generates fertilizer for you, you can buy or find these. Gourd is probably the hardest to find but it is on some tables at camp sites. I believe I find it regularly at the cabins just north east of WhiteSpring, the one with the green roof.
---
With the frequency that I find grenades of all kinds, it is not unreasonable to want them to do decent damage.   Especially when the guns do so little damage unless you invest in a large number of perks.  I do sneaking headshots all the time and still have to follow up with a cascade of bullets.  Earlier in the game I would simply throw an explosive of any kind into the middle of a group and then do a bunch of headshots.  Even then I would have to shoot some mobs two or three times in the head, but whatever, that's fine.    Now with 2 or 3 star (I think 2, but I can't remember) exterminating handmade that ignores a portion of armor protection fully modded out, I throw a grenade, do about 20% damage with a direct hit (or less) instead of 50%, and then tons of headshots to follow up, just burning through ammo at a ridiculous pace.   I spend far too much time farming resources.   My friends all use the highest fire rates and burn the most ammo to be able to send enough damage downrange.  that has never been my play style.  I would much rather have slower shots that do much more damage.  
---
You claim baggage, yet I'm just explaining why this is so frustrating.  I never used a TSE.  Never had one.  I simply used basic explosives and was okay with them.  Before the nerf I thought they were a little underpowered, but whatever.  It was playable.   They have made the game far less playable with ANY of the weapons I have tried.  I just picked up the lever action plans, so I'm working on learning those mods.  Maybe I can find a legendary version of that gun that doesn't completely suck.  I'm willing to try, but how long will it take?  No idea.
---
You mention ghouls:  yeah, I don't use grenades with most ghouls, but then again I almost never have trouble with ghouls killing me because ghouls (even glowing ones) aren't grossly overpowered.   The couple of places I do run into ghouls in large groups where use grenades is because they are in close quarters and it is easy to damage a bunch of them all at once.  Otherwise, I switch to my melee and take them out with the heavies of heavies I have found.  Usually one hit or two.  Sometimes the uber legendary ghoul shows up and he takes 3 or 4 hits.  In melee, up close and personal, that is a lot of damage you have to absorb, but there are perks that make that readily do-able.   However in order to have those perks loaded, I can't have 3 level 3 gun perks loaded at the same time.  There isn't enough points to go around to do all the things that need to be done to make a character viable.
---
You talk about "heavily relying on grenades"   First of all:  If they didn't want people regularly using grenades, then why do I pick them up all the time?  They are regular drops.  Secondly, I almost never run out. (That should tell you the frequency that I use grenades right there...  what ever the drop rate is, is about the rate I used them before the nerf.)  I never had to make grenades.  I never had to go grenade hunting.  I just used what I found and it did enough damage that I could handle a group of super mutants (with some trouble because their fire rates are insanely OP when in large groups) and I could easily handle a group of scorched or most wildlife.  That means I wasn't using grenades in every encounter, but I was using them for crowd control.  Now there are more crowds and less damage output.  That's stupid.   One of the times I died recently I had 5 waves of super mutants come at me.  I cleared the first wave (all the ones that were visible in an area, probably about 4 or 5 mutants) and the second wave came in.  I was thinking, okay these were the ones that were nearby.   Then the 3rd wave came in and I'm starting to think:  "What, is there a factory here".   There wasn't a king that I could see anywhere.  I died on the 5th wave, came back, got my junk, and killed the last couple mutants.  
---
If the game is going to throw that much crap at me, it isn't too much to ask that the firepower that is readily available in the game f-ing work to keep up with it.
---
The FACT that the game is largely unchanged with the loss of explosive damage is the point:   The game needs a massive overhaul to its weapon balance system as most weapon types are unusable.  If you don't believe me, I'll make you 5 ranged weapons, highest level, fully modded out with the strongest mods, and you can take your pick of them and see how long you last playing with that weapon.   I could probably expand that to 10 ranged guns that all completely and utterly suck.   Also, you claim that explosives weigh too much.  They don't if that is what you spent your perk points on, but now that the damage output sucks, you have to gain a bunch of levels with garbage for alternative weapons just to try and respec your character.  Except you liked playing the way you were playing and you aren't finding any other way to play that is remotely as enjoyable... how would you feel?    It's pretty hard to gain levels when all the weapons you get your hands on are complete garbage in terms of damage output.
---
Put yourself in other people's shoes for once:  You've leveled up your character.  You've picked your stats and perks.  Your character build was working great for you.  You could do some decent damage at range and when they bared down upon you, you could clean up with some melee.  Then they nerf a type of weapon you weren't even using by attacking the underlying damage types themselves and now ruining entire classes of weapons, ruining your build out, and making the game a whole lot less fun.   All they had to do was address the overpowered combination and a better balance would have been struck.   They could have removed that weapon and replaced it with one that was still strong but within the standards they are going for.   Since they nerfed an entire damage type, they could have at least improved 0.50 cal to a usable status.  They did absolutely nothing to balance the game.  You cannot balance a game by simply destroying things that work without improving things that don't work.  
---
If you don't mind blowing massive amounts of ammo all the time, good for you.  I hate that style of play.
---
Have you ever tried melee? It's hard, if your nerf it. To b on pair with guns dmg why would you ever melee? Makes absolute no fckin sense to claim dps equality 
---
As of last night's SBQ fight, my anti-armor .50cal mg outclasses my TSE .50cal mg.
---
Have you played fallout 4 survival mode? It plays pretty similarly 
---
with constant inventory management do you mean selling everything? because i constantly have to sell everything. i recently gave my friend 40 stimpaks because my stash i full and i already have 40 super stimpaks.
---
and i mean, as far as overencumbered mechanics go, this game is super forgiving... you can still run, jump, shoot, etc. there really is nothing punishing with carrying things above capacity, except for the no fast travel; which is no issue, since you'd only need to find a craft bench and scrap everything to unlock fast travel.
---
if they made the game easier, they might as well just remove the weight system and stimpaks entirely. just have an innate healing ability on cooldown.
---
I've found it at full time, and solo it's doable but you really want a 10mm to vats shoot the fireflies. Or some kind of pipe pistol for irrelevant ammo wasting. Because melee is annoying and the small weapons take up less vats meter. Collect them all first then run up to the tower and drop them in there. It's pretty anticlimatic 
---
I've seen some too but they weren't his
---
I actually like that factor. Its definitely designed for people who enjoy inventory management. I feel it adds a layer of always on the hunt for resources. This isnt always a good thing and does need balancing though. My rifles and gatling guns shouldn't need repairing every day.
---
Best thing anyone can do until they fix it is just throw it in the garbage and turn on fallout 4
---
I will try anthem when i will see real proof that is better than warframe or destiny. Cause right now it ain't different enough for me to put hours in the same game yet again. 
---
I still can't quite believe that Star Wars Galaxies removed my entire class.
---
Buried in a secluded location?
---
The only one I've encountered was level 22 so I didn't expect much form it. Would be nice to have some unique alien themed outfits or equipment though.
---
Try moving your camp. Maybe your in a popular spot and people are A-Holes when thier camp doesn't spawn. Like it's your fault or something.
---
Do not rush. the advice of someone who did everything fast and now has nothing to do except grinding endlessly. 
---
I will ping you a name where I bought mine later, I think he advertised here, he might be able to help, remind me later if I don't get back to you. He was selling them at a reasonable price.
---
I used quantum grenades and plasma mines. The plasma grenade is nice too. I still haven't crafted mirv granade but I know from reading forums, guys have used these in trap houses to kill people. The experimental mirv is fun to use, but 8 nukes =\]
---
You is one nosy ass person...leave people alone. Let them play, they are not hurting you one bit. 
---
nos·y\[ˈnōzē\]ADJECTIVE 
---
1. (of a person or their behavior) showing too much curiosity about other people's affairs.
---
If you search the nearby apartment buildings, you can find a breadcrumb quest that leads you to an isolated garage (something-brothers garage) where you can find a cultist outfit and the key to the shrine in the basement of the museum.
---
Entirely possible, and irritating. 
---
What the flying hell is fallout market?
---
The downside to God mode.
---
What are you playing on.  There are a lot of higher level players who love to share what they have learned, or extra stuff they have farmed not to take away you own progress, but just to share.  Check all the garbage cans as well as the cash registers by the merchants.  Take it slow and you will be impressed with just exploring the countryside while following the quests.  If you get PvPd (never happened to me since last November) you only use junk, so store often and take it with a grain of salt.  
---
Fuckem
---
I have and that's the only way I like to play fallout 4!! My excitement is now through the roof !! I'm going into 76 blind so I know nothing about it. Knowing there is a survival mode is omg amazing!! Thank you ! :)
---
Toilet paper? Why
---
The example in the linked comment about the minigun is pretty interesting. 
---
I've commented elsewhere that things like the minigun and the .50 cal machinegun were developed and / or used IRL to take out armoured vehicles or fighter planes. These are *powerful* weapons. But when I can outperform a .50 HMG with a slightly modded hunting rifle, somethin' ain't right. 
---
I would prefer if the powerful weapons were actually powerful, and were balanced in the game by greater scarcity of ammunition. If you can only reliably source about two reloads for your BFG, you know that you have to save it for the boss fight. 
---
Fair
---
lololol this game not even worth 10 cents! hahaha xDdddDdd
---
What is it then? Other then broken, and no longer installed on the PCs and consoles of an ever increasingly unhappy group of customers.
---
What regular enemies? Got an explosive ghoul slayers minigun and it mowed em down without demolition expert or two shot. And it is a minigun ffs, which is a bad weapon in every way.
---
I get oneshoting enemies is fun for people, but that was ridiculous before. 
---
I think it’s because you actually do quests to “rank up” with them, and the presence of MODUS. I don’t recall any other faction having both a living member, as well as actual ranks that you can achieve. It’s either crawling up the ranks in a dead organization, or doing random errands for a *mostly* dead organization.
---
The Enclave stuff actually has a purpose to it.
---
Just take your time, have fun, and look for a good place to set your camp up.  
---
Rofl, I did something like that, only worse. Was hopping looking for heavy combat legs, but what I didn't have was the arms. RIP caps...
---
Yea, none of the godly melee weapons on the market are duped. Nope, just the TSE guns
---
Check containers near vendors, like in the train stations, for loot dropped by players.
---
Build a camp in the middle of the area you are exploring.
---
Scrap weapons you pick up frequently to learn new mods and rebuild armor/weapons as you level. 
---
Aluminum, plastic, steel, springs, gears and adhesives.
---
Check vendors for plans/stuff.
---
Take your time and enjoy.
---
Don't go up,remember........ "it just works"
---
Yeah I'm very slow lol I like to go slow at my games for this exact reason lol I dont gotta be the first or strongest to clear content as long as I clear it :)
---
Figure out what you have that you don’t need to store, and get rid of it
---
My camp is near where people like to camp, but not close enough to bounce them out. The game needs to be changed, not my location. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** PracticalOnions! ^(hug)
---
I still haven't found it, despite having gone looking quite a few times :-/
---
They shouldn't have!!!
---
In my line of work if you f up big time and piss off customers....you work all weekend until you fix the problem.
---
you're right. they should remove leveling entirely because it's just a way to 'slow our progression'. in fact, remove the entire game, because it's just about progression.
---
instead, add a screen that says "you've won! play again?" that loops infinitely. there is absolutely no need for progression and only the end-result matters. end-result being that you won. clearly, anything that stands between the player and them winning is a lazy excuse by developers, and they might as well dismantle the entire game because it just slows progression to a crawl.
---
my stash really has nothing but junk, ores and bullets I don't use though...
---
What’s “reasonable”
---
Perfect, thank you very much

Thank you for the kind words everyone.  Its great to see so many people as passionate as I am with Fallout building.
---
You can build the campfire slightly below the floor if you're able to fib the aesthetic. That way you can plant crops then place the tile over it. Only evidence of the fire is a pulsing light source you can explain away with proper extra lighting
---
So *that's* what I've been doing wrong!
---
Lookout for scrochbeasts - try to avoid them even if you can kill them - pointless waste of ammor and time, no reward.
---
Go for a melee build, which is the OP now.
---
On train stations look inside of suitcases, trashbins, containers, etc - a lot of high lvl players (including myself) leave unneeded loot, you might find in handy at start, and it lasts longer in the world before dissapearing than the paper bags.
---
Now that I see this, it makes perfect sense that this weapon should be less powerful than a board.
---
Oh okay thank you ! Hopfully I'll stay hidden lol so no one will kill me I hope lol also I'm on the ps4.
---
PS4 also. I’m interested in checking out your inventory 
---
How is this game hard?
---
 It having enough perks doesn’t sound right. 
---
Not bragging but before I uninstalled I had max caps (25k I think) I even made a post asking why there was a limit. This was legit mind you. No duping just selling crap 
---
Granted I hoarded and did merchant runs every day
---
The solution is to fix the stability. 4 crashes in less than hour so far. 
---
New players ?!? Game doesn't work Period 
---
Yeah, I've seen a ridiculous take-down with a Gauss rifle as well, although not as dramatic as with the harpoon. The player was in a team with one another player, and both had logged in with an additional character (don't think this double-login is possible anymore though). All their characters got loot (perk of being in a team). You know what the worst part was? Once they had triple-tapped Fissure Prime, they just traveled with all their characters to the roof of the golf club in Whitespring and waited for people to spawns the ghouls, that they then mowed down with their one-shotting TSEs. I created an alternate after witnessing that. It is so much more fun to run around scared in the Savage Divide as a low-level character and not worry about end-game content.
---
I think the proportional damage was something they added when people complained about low-level players joining the SBQ fight to tag her without really contributing to the fight. Unfortunately, this "feature" hits all the other players as well when they're up against SBQ farmers.
---
Thanks mate. That really means a lot to me. I’m really self conscious about stuff like this but all my friends say I should get into it. I can never tell if it’s just them being nice or if I’m actually any good.
---
One of the reasons I started this was jut to practice voice acting so I’m glad you think it’s worth pursuing.
---
I got a assultron head a while ago from a deathclaw but decided to sell it because of the big. I didn't know if it was still active
---
More of this.
---
Please.
---
Yes, it might be the best for humankind.
---
Yes. Watoga and free state vendor has combat armor plan but only either Heavy/sturdy/light , arm/leg/torso ONLY one plan at a time. If someone bought it then he won’t have it. Also Grafton vendor sells BOS mod plan
---
Someone tried to convince me that “pistols are weak guns, of course a 2h melee is going to be stronger” after I explained that my “weak pistol” shoots exploding bullets and I have countless perks for it. Yet still, a baseball bat does more damage.
---
Thank you for the tips !! I will definitely be on the look out for the loot and parts :)
---
Same, you arent gonna find me playing 4 without stuff like the Wattz laser gun and the like.
---
If i cant have a neat handmade id take the 500 caps. You can have it. Have no use for it anyways
---
Even with the TSE prepatch the minguns were barely usable. Now you can scrap them all. 
---
Got hooked on them from the one in flatwoods fridge. 
---
Are you implying the game is in an unplayable state? Because that would be a lie and you would be toxic
---
1) Enjoy the game with full understanding that there are still a lot of glitches and balance issues. Please don't come back on the forums to rage about the issues you find without being constructive to the overall discussion.
---
2) If you are not interested in pvp then turn on passive mode. This prevents you from dealing damage to other players accidentally. Note that if you claim a workshop or if you team up with someone who initiates pvp that your passive setting will be overwritten.
---
3) Look for brown bags and in the cash registers at any vendor bots. People will drop in items they don't need because they are not sell-able or because they feel charitable. 
---
4) Be careful about running into any old building. Each area has a range of levels for the enemies. Those levels are determined by the player nearest to the enemies when they spawn. So if you are lvl 5 and the area you are in ranges up to lvl 30, you could open a door and find a lvl 30 super mutant on the other side. 
---
5) Have a mic. The game is multitudes better if you can talk rather than just emote at players.
---
6) Scrap everything and scrap often. Scraping junk reduces weight and you will be glad you have all that junk when you build your first real CAMP.
---
think full timer is closer to 15 minutes. I've done it alone a handful of times, you just have to get lucky with toad spawns or drink cola to restore AP when hunting the fireflies if the timer is short. The biggest problem is becoming overencumbered by all the bioluminescent fluid in my experience. If you have full time you can just walk around and hit them with a melee weapon and you'll finish in good time.
---
I've had that glitch before.  That was one long and epic battle.  Finally killed here with help from the robots and a few players at Watoga.
---
Sorry the melee disclaimer has become knee jerk, honestly think melee weapons (generally) are one of the few weapon groups that seem to have a reasonable DMG/Hit/Durability interaction.  
---
As to the Gatling, I have a TS, Faster fire with speedy, and generally see it needing repair after about. 2 hours of use, not broken, but damaged enough to make it worth repairing.  
---
Using a dagger (lower damage, more frequent attacks so
---
More durability hits) I can be full melee and repair the dagger ever other 2 or 3 hour play session 
---
Yeah, just keep the way it is right, one shotting everything while guns take 20 bullets to down crap enemies. You are right, keep the way it is.
---
I stopped. There’s nothing I haven’t done, and my guns are now shit.
---
Dude, we have Xedit. The armor system is legit the exact same. People have seen this in action. Even the range falloff that was in FO4 is in 76.
---
I contracted Completionism from a radrat pup. I have to buy those plans, Morty. It's my series arc.
---
I have been leaving duplicate plans, stimpaks, purified water, etc in the overseers stash at the fire station. Also maxed out low level weapons in the overseers stashes. I have no clue if it has helped anyone, but I still like doing it.
---
Use melee until you can build up you ammo.
---
Scrap guns to learn the mods.
---
Make corn soup, it counts as food and water.
---
Pick perks for the weapon you like and stick with it.
---
DO NOT make an energy weapon build. 
---
Scrap your junk and store it as iften as you can.
---
You have to actually click on plans to learn them.
---
Stay in the forrest until you level up.
---
Dont rush the main quest, gear is level based and rushing through leads to low level quest loot that is useless late game. 
---
Have fun. 
---
It's a walking bug simulator? 
---
Amy,
---
Some advice to help alleviate at least part of your frustration, and I apologize that the game forces you down this path. 
---
Firstly, I'd recommend crafting armor rather than repairing it. It's cheaper and armor that requires ballistic fiber to repair doesn't need it to craft a new piece, such as leather armor. It also gives you better armor every 5 levels so if you learn a few modifications you should be able to make it a decent strength and cheap.
---
Secondly, given how things stand, I'd recommend getting a powerful melee weapon and focusing on melee perks. The strength will help with weight, but also melee weapons still seem like the go-to in many instances, even at the end of the game. So go with something like Makeshift Weapon to reduce the degradation and be able to repair it more cheaply. 
---
Thirdly, don't carry so many weapons and bullets. It just doesn't seem like the way they want the game played.
---
I hope you found this helpful and I'm sorry that this game is lacking in fun because of the poor mechanics. Once you're higher level you'll eventually get a bit more freedom and be able to get other perks and move around SPECIAL points.
---
Huh, bdo is still a thing apparently. 
---
Use radiation to get mutated, don't get rid of radworms
---
Ok, agree to disagree then. I think the TS nerf was too much. Makes no sense to the discription with accuracy penalty already in place. Ranged weapons were weak as they were now most ts ranged wend from ok to shit. Gatling gun is still ”ok” given the competion.
---
But only time will tell i guess.
---
idk, game seems easier to me?!?  I was working one of my favorite loot sites full off super mutants, but now Im one shotting them when before it took 3.
---
Shhhh hide this post before Bethesda decides this is their next fix! /s
---
I’ll try it if it goes free to play.
---
I'm normaly a sneaky person in my games so hopfully a sneak build will be good. These scrochbeasts are they like the deathclaws of this fallout ? Also they dont drop loot ?
---
Jesus, it's been only 2.5 months? Feels way longer.
---
There were some older lists floating around (I'll see if I can find the links again), but they were pre-latest patch, which makes them kind of obsolete. I've started to add updates myself and will put together a post with the info this week.
---
I don't even get it, considering how many people for example would have bought the black power armor skin by now. They are just shooting themselves in the foot 
---
I wasn't even looking for him he just showed up
---
Take that bad boy to the golf club loot cave and mow down all of the legendary before the degenerates get a chance to pot shot them.
---
Let's see if we can get ghoul slayers nerfed.
---
They fixed it wrong. The SBQ shouldn't get stronger based on the number of people that show up, but based on those people plus a.modifier based on their level. Let all the new players come and tag her. They might not help, but they won't hurt, either. 
---
I do it like [this](https://i.imgur.com/gfDXTHp.png), just a ring of foundations. Looks better than floating crops imo.
---
Oh snap, just realized ur affiliated with the dev team.  Thanks even more! I love the game and the way it tells such wonderful stories. Thanks for all you did and continue to do for th fans.
---
You can really tell from how a person talks, that they're still in middle school
---
You cant hate someone for trying something new, but you can hate someone for lying. 
---
This is why we need timers on the map, no reason to travel to this one if 5min are left, but you won't know that. 
---
agreed, there is no challenge in the game at all. i constantly have to bulk and sell everything. i recently sold 200 screws because i already had 500! i have over 20 bulks of springs, 10 bulks of everything else, and i never run out. i constantly find myself selling everything; my junk has a high turn-over rate.
---
even when i do run out of junk - say plastic or lead - it's a super trivial matter of 5\~ min to gather the required materials that you lack. with locations memorized - of gyms, toy stores, billiard pool tables, etc - you can practically rack up even over a hundred of whatever lacking junk you have.
---
in truth, a lot of my junk is spent on maintenance, but that's not something you notice when you constantly have junk. perks like 'white knight' and 'luck of the draw' minimizes the junk required as well.
---
if they made junk even more accessible, they might as well get rid of it entirely. what they should do is not increase amount of junk looted, or even decrease amount of junk required to repair/craft things, but simply lower the rate that things break. lowering the rate, they could even increase the repair costs; make the need for maintenance more rare, but at the same time make it more costly, which in my personal opinion would be a more interesting play cycle (as opposed to the one where you constantly have to repair your gear every time you visit your camp).
---
One of the best replies here. It does feel a bit of a challenge now, but its fun and I don't want to run up to every encounter and simply one shot everything. Did they tweak things a bit to hard, sure they did. I think the Two Shots should still do an extra 100% damage, but I think the change to Explosive was actually right. These weapons are really 1 1/4 Shot weapons now with the move they made. But if you don't upgrade Armor and Weapons and keep on the Perks, your going to have a hard time. I learned pretty quick that my lvl 5 hunting rifle was not doing enough and I needed to build a new one at lvl 25 and the same goes for all the armor. Sherpa's are not a bad idea at all. 
---
It’s the name brand.
---
neat
---
&gt;(my characters were paralyzed and I was unable to move anywhere or do anything.
---
"The game isn't perfect" e.e 
---
Sometimes I think this community deserves all the crap Bethesda is throwing at it.
---
You can't get double/quad on any black powder weapons unfortunately, and you can't get any legendary blunderbuss' yet either :( Not sure why these people are lying to you, I have not seen a single one of any of these items even though i've been very active on the trading subs since launch, so that should be enough proof. I do keep making posts about it and hopefully Beth will add the blunderbuss' to the legendary loot pool, but I doubt they will add double/quad BP weapons as that would be kinda broken even for legendaries lol.  
---
Well, technically there isn't a cure for depression. There are meds that can help with the symptoms, but until the person suffering from depression either decides to get over whatever caused their depression, or in others, the chemical imbalance somehow gets resolved, either by diet change, or medication, but that can then change again and again so it is a continuous struggle for the patient. 
---
In my first example, those people are typically depressed because of a specific event such as a friend or relative dying, it is more of a physical response. It is understandable and that is why I say they are depressed. 
---
The second example is a person suffering from depression. This is typically a chemical imbalance that causes the person to be clinically depressed. This is not something that a person can just get over. I explain myself because I don't want anyone to just assume I am some ignorant dumbass that doesn't understand what depression is. Also, I know there is more to depression, but this was basically the simplest way to describe here. 
---
Not all of us play online/multiplayer games.  I never do, and I've been gaming for a lonnng time.  This is a hard adjustment to make, and it's one of the reasons I was against an online-only Fallout.
---
Great tips list thank you ! I do use a mic but only talk some I'd the other person is pretty cool will keep that in mind though! I'm glad there is a passive mode though I am more of a pve kinda gal :)
---
That linked post aggressively over-states its point, IMO. Energy weapons *do* get the shaft when it comes to armor values and damage calculations in Fallout 4 (and presumably 76), but I actually personally like a few quirks of the math of this armor system.
---
1. As long as the high-damage weapon does not fully penetrate the target's armor (which occurs when the effective armor value is at or below roughly 15% of the attack value), the high-RoF weapon and the high-damage weapon have the same damage ratio to each other regardless of the target's armor (i.e. if the high-damage weapon deals 4x the per-hit damage as the high-RoF weapon when the target has 500 armor, it'll still be 4x the damage if the target has 600 or even 4000 armor).
---
2. There is no armor over-penetration. If a weapon fully ignores a target's armor, it gains no benefit from further sources of armor penetration, and further applied damage increases are linear.
---
3. There is not a 1:1 tradeoff between paper damage and RoF. This is a tricky one to balance in practice, but an automatic assault rifle actually kills targets faster than its semi-auto counterpart since it trades only a modest amount of damage (~13% net per-shot damage loss vs sufficiently-armored targets) for a major fire rate bonus (75 instead of 40).
---
The ballistic damage reduction system itself doesn't need to be changed (energy damage, however, needs to be brought in line with ballistics), Bethesda just needs to take advantage of their own system and adjust numbers according to it rather than just eyeballing a 0-armor balance point. For instance, which deals more DPS against an opponent with 500 effective armor, a 600-damage attack hitting once per second or a 50-damage attack hitting 30 times per second, and by how much?
---
As if most enemies didn't rush you the moment they notice the player. Also there are perks that reduce melee dmg taken, aren't there? 
---
Attacking from range means nothing when you shoot nonstop but the crappiest enemy can still get to melee range as we do next to no dmg with guns. In the end you take less dmg from an enemy in melee than ranged as everything closes at you before you can shoot them down (and melee players take reduced dmg with a perk).
---
Tip if you haven't figured it out, store PA parts you can't or arn't using on PA chassis.  Strip what you can use off the chassis, enter it, exit, put the PA back on the chassis, and let it recall to you.  Then store that in your stash.  The PA chassis takes up just 10 weight no matter what PA parts are on it.
---
Yeah that's kinda how it felt. 
---
Blame Bethesda programmers for allowing duping in the first place.
---
Imagine if Fortnite let a player drop a legendary scar and all if his squad could pick it up at the same time. That's not the players fault.
---
Yup. If you have the patience to charge it up, a quad head can do serious damage. 
---
Assuming OP does the work around to load it properly :O
---
Small shack behind R&amp;G has 6-8 bags. 
---
I agree. 
---
Are you sure the BOS plan is still at Grafton post patch. I tried server hopping for it and never saw it yesterday.
---
Something that i have noticed...they are making water..but they do not ALL make water at the same time..the water purifiers are just containers..and will hold water that is being produced up to their max.  
---
So basically..if you have 10 water purifiers..it will make 1 water at a time..and start storing it one at a time till your containers are filled.
---
Haha so wait I'm supposed to be irradiated lol why ? And what are radworms lol a type of parasite??
---
I use full heavy coma at and I do just fine on my stealth build
---
Maybe we can build a wall around Appalachia too? 
---
I could do that for whole 5 mins and then I would run out of whatever amount of ammo i could reasonably have. 
---
I tried it once in ws, works great, is unsustainable in more ways than ammo. Still waited till people around also tagged the legendary, as I always try to do. 
---
I lost some items during these months. Always thought it was something I did wrong but several quest items went missing like the Rose syringer and other non legendary weapons (luckily)
---
Can we have an heads up on this,please? Since it seems to been happened to several people atm?
---
Spruce Knob campgrounds
---
I really think many of the issues pertaining to damage and build issues could be resolved over time but they wont. I'm sure there's  a small team working on these issues working hard but there's just too much for the team to do. There's not enough manpower behind them to get it done and Bethesda doesn't care because the games player base tanked. Really sucks this game flopped could've been so good if they weren't so greedy. 
---
A freaking board does more damage and mini NUKES in this game. Its a total freak show.
---
Give enemies an armor/shield bar and once you break it their armor is gone and as it weakens the armor amount goes down.
---
They're closer to skyrim dragons, and the loot is garbage. Also, sneak is super viable in this game but there is a bug right now that kind of ruins it. 
---
Freakin' badass!
---
“Months if playing” and “forever” are very different. Games like call of duty, fortnite, halo, are very simple but have a long lifetime because people get what they expect. Join a game, shoot some people, win/lose, and do it again on the next map. It’s repetitive but that’s part of the fun. You get better, use different guns etc. RPGs shouldn’t be like that, but unfortunately, this one is. When you’re high level, there’s nothing rewarding to do but nuke and grind for legendaries. And it’s not as easy as call of duty when it comes to trying different builds. You would most likely have to start a new character and grind it out again, instead of picking a class from the start menu.
---
The game *is* a lot of fun, and that’s why people played it to death. Now, we’ve done everything and don’t enjoy the upkeep simulator that it has become, and as a result, complain about it.
---
I like to play sneaky is stealth melee okay to start with ?
---
oh i see
---
It’s fuking stupid cuz everything weight tons w/o perks and gear breaks fast as paper costs a lot of junk to repair. And stash box space is shit . Basically they just let u go scavenging &gt; gear break&gt; scavenging junk to repair &gt; repeat
---
Yep I like this idea more
---
They are fantasy Pringle’s, which are not chips. They are “crisps” as noted on the can; because they are not pieces of potato, but instead reconstituted shavings.
---
There are 2 major things you can do as a melee player:
---
Clear out the add-on mobs for the players that are shooting the queen, you can run around and beat them all down, when the queen lands, jump over and give her a couple power attacks.
---
Get a support type weapon, for example I've been using a cryolator to slow the queen down, making her an easy target for everyone else, and when she lands all frozen and slow, then i jump in and attack.  You could also look to some of the crippling weapons like the shotgun/enforcer this would for her to land so you can then jump in.
---
I've only been playing for two weeks.
---
It maybe all of the things said and or plus just the game and or the server... that you are on... I've killed many times because the game seems to know just when to atk during a way to long at that moment weapon  reload, or my stim hot key just fails to work at all... and I have had all the issues said and my rig is top tier and I am on a 1g/1g net...
---
Ah dang that's pretty darn cool fallout dragons !! Prob much scarier than deathclaws lol. That's a bummer about this bug why does it ruin it?
---
Ranged weapons should NOT be meta. 
---
A melee build should be just as viable as a ranged build. 
---
I would laugh.. But Soros
---
 There are Deathclaws in the game. These are special and make the game so much better. They arew the apex predator in the game. You will learn to fear them. Then you will learn to kill them. Its just great.
---
 They drop loot but many are not happy with what gets dropped. A couple of Roasted Hearts is why I kill em'.
---
So, here's how water purifiers work:
---
* Each purifier can hold a limited amount of water. for example, industrial purifiers can hold 5.  
---
* Each purifier is has a specific production rate; for example, industrial purifiers are rated for 60/hour.
---
Here's the counterintuitive part: *your camp treats all purifiers as one system, and the system's production rate is only as high as its highest rated purifier.* This means that if you build two industrial purifiers, your camp doesn't produce 120 units of water per hour, because the production rate is only ever going to be as high as the highest rated purifier in your camp, which in this case is 60/hr. Increasing the number of purifiers does *not* increase production rate; however, increasing the number of purifiers *does* increase your camp's capacity.
---
So, what does all that mean? Let's say you plunk down three industrial purifiers, rated at 60 units/hr and each with a capacity of 5 units. Here's what each purifier's inventory will look like as time passes:
---
Minutes | Purifier 1 | Purifier 2 | Purifier 3
---
:----:|:----------:|:----------:|:--------:
---
0 | 0 | 0 | 0
---
1 | 1 | 0 | 0
---
2 | 1 | 1 | 0
---
3 | 1 | 1 | 1
---
4 | 2 | 1 | 1
---
5 | 2 | 2 | 1
---
6 | 2 | 2 | 2
---
7 | 3 | 2 | 2
---
8 | 3 | 3 | 2
---
9 | 3 | 3 | 3
---
10 | 4 | 3 | 3
---
11 | 4 | 4 | 3
---
12 | 4 | 4 | 4
---
13 | 5 | 4 | 4
---
14 | 5 | 5 | 4
---
15 | 5 | 5 | 5
---
So it'll take 15 minutes for all three purifiers to fill up. (Note that there's a display bug where sometimes the contents of your purifier don't display on mouseover unless you go into the "Transfer" menu [press "R" on PC]) BTW, this is also how crops seem to work, with each plant serving as a one-unit container, meaning planting a whole field of mutfruit plants won't affect how quickly your camp grows them, only how many you can hold at once.
---
Now, the reason *why* they decided to implement the system this way is a bit iffy; maybe they didn't want people to be able to create ridiculous aqua farms, who knows. 
---
Ok since you have a legitimate ailment I'll tell you the secret.
---
1. Fight the SBQ and/or buy one serum plan from the vendor.
---
1. Sell serums to other players to get more caps.
---
1. Buy more serum plans from other players.
---
not a frisbee, it’s a pizza cutter
---
Most put at least a few from what I see.
---
You were born that way.
---
You can use any armor. 
---
There's nothing left to do so I don't play anymore. Just checking out the sub to see if any major content was added yet.
---
May I ask what is your line of work?
---
Yes I did. I needed suggestions as to the best area of the map to go to. But i have already received some very gracious and helpful responses.  They were quite refreshing actually, as I fully expected to get the typical sarcastic responses one finds so often on these posts. 
---
Thanks anyway. Have a nice day.  
---
This... it's amazing to me how much people miss the whole point of the entire way this game was marketed-- the freaking entire basis of the entire story of this entire game is /community rebuilding/ and yet here we are, with no tools to do that and people thinking human NPCs is going to fix that. Nah. Not even remotely.
---
I have sessions where I almost never shed agro, even though there are no enemies around, makes sneak crits pretty hard to do. 
---
I used to out my TS away and pull out a switch blade for Whitesprings.
---
Now that the crybabies got my shit nerfed..........I go there with my Instigating Super Sledge and one shot everything.
---
**Use the perk system.**
---
If you're being weighed down too easily, use perks to lighten your load.  If you're running out of ballistic fiber, use White Knight and you'll always have more than you need.
---
Seriously, I've got several hundred Ballistic Fiber now that I no longer need.  If you're on Xbox, let me know and I'll give you a hundred of them.
---
One of the trickier things about this game is learning to use the perk system for convenience and not just power.  Maybe that's not how it should be, but that's the game we've got.
---
The answer is simple, you just need to have better inventory management for your character and stash box. It's not that hard to do. Once you get into the rhythm of it, I have figured out how to do it pretty good and I at least have 100 inventory space and more on my character and stash box old time you don't need everything in the game, half of it is completely useless, and you'll never use it, especially like 90 percent of medical items.time people like the carry all those mini nukes and power cores, which you do not need, you only need to power cores at all times because I'm sure you know 1001 places where a power armor is, and where there's a power armor, there's a power core, so whenever you get low, you can just go to one of those just simple things like that
---
it removed them, I had just crafted 4 and had one after the quest.
---
Foundations are stackable. The trick is to use a camp fire that is just slightly over the edge to initiate the snap for the foundation. There is a nice vid floating around this sub showing the details of how to get it going.
---
Not sure if it'll help I was walking on the road by Dolly Sods when he attacked me I had just fast travelled to doly sods to get some springs and was walking to the power plant via the road
---
Ohhh I see that would be annoying! 
---
well there not long 1 min but you got to do a loding every 10 secs in the game so ya loadings are bad
---
I have seen those Exacavator suits and wondered where they got them. Thanks. Very helpful.
---
They'll drop some good meat and some bones and leather you can scrap and lately they've been dropping 1 weapon or armor piece and either ammo or like 2-3 stimpacks for me, so not all that great. If you can get them to land and melee them then it's totally worth it
---
Well jeez.. where do measly little beginners such as myself get good stuff like this and how the heck did you all figure this stuff out? I hated the game in the beginning bc it was/is lacking so much. But since I bought it I decided to finally play it and I'm enjoying myself a bit but so many things are frustrating me. Like my tiny CAMP budget and just lack of information on how/what perk cards to choose. I mean I see a lot of different builds but I don't know what to choose and now if I choose is it an old build from pre nerfs etc. I'm having fun but lost af. 
---
Bethesda could just make the favorite tag the same as quest item tag. But that would be too convenient
---
Won't agree with this behaviour, but it is available in the game without any exploits so you do you. 
---
They will be much smaller then a silo.
---
168 with no perks, maybe. There are so many perks that allow you to close that gap, whether they be blocking perks, or straight up DR improvements. And it’s “168”, but when you take into account the perk that ignores 70% of armor, it’s a lot more than that.
---
That is soooo funny, and sadly true...
---
Syringer is useful if you want things to talk though
---
And i wanted it to be missile launcher because missiles are rare
---
I think I’ve blown up one vehicle, and it was by accident.  I need to try this more often.  I assume it’s a smart tactic with enemies close by the vehicle. 
---
If Frank Horrigan had a pet
---
Right, should say to wait till you have the starched genes perk also. Radiation damage can make you mutated, which gives different abilities/stat changes. Good example is marsupial which let's you jump higher, and gives extra carry weight, but you take a hit to your agility (pretty sure it's agi). 
---
Radworms are a parasite that are just supposed to make you take extra rad damage, but has been also increasing mutation abilities ( marsupial jumps even higher, adds more carry weight). This is just a bug though and will probably be fixed. Maybe.
---
Why would it matter?
---
A better question would be what line of work is it acceptable to leave the customer with a f'd up experience and to dip out for the weekend?
---
Would love if bethesda hired some of the top modders to create those things to the actual game and not just mods to be available to everyone
---
Cool :-)
---
A lot of legendary weapond are trash, aren't worth vendoring in the first place, and should just be thrown or give away. My stash stays with an extra 100lbs at least. I keep my junk low (I generally use excess silver, gold, circuits, and asbestos to vendor my 1400 and I keep all other junk under 100 individual items, generally closer to 50 for ones without much use), don't hold onto garbage or vanilla weapons, keep an eye on ammo you're holding. 
---
Keeping your inventory in check isn't super hard. But you do have to learn what you need, how much you need, and (most importantly) what to throw away. Once you have a good idea about what resources your playstyle and build requires, it's easy to maintain. 
---
I get people like to horde. But seriously, there's shit you're never going to use. And part of surviving is about learning necessities. 
---
OMG!!! SPOILER ALERT lol !!!
---
Yes, I am sick of it. But, they will never fix it. This isn't me shitting on the game; it's me coming to terms with Bethesda's lack polish and broken promises. I will continue to play in the slight chance of improvement, but I see no real reason to believe that would happen. Fallout 3 was the first game to get me into this series, and continues to be my all-time favorite game, but this game and all its faults has broken what trust I had in Bethesda. Sorry, but I needed to say it. Keep surviving, Wastelanders.
---
Tedious is the right word. What I loved about FO4 was I never really felt like I was grinding, like ever. I was always on a quest. Yes the forever Preston quests were slightly annoying, but compared to the nothingburger in this game I didn’t realize how good I had it. FO4 looks like a masterpiece now compared to this. I can never really understand what is really happening with the repairing in this game. Is it supposed to add realism? If so, I can shoot an actual real gun 100s of times without doing more then cleaning it and oiling it after. I mean I just don’t get it. It’s like somehow something that wasn’t even on the radar in FO4 now has become one of the pillars of gameplay. Add that to nerfing all the good guns and it’s like drudgery and tediousness ALL the time. 
---
I COMPLETELY agree. It’s already a difficulty shock to me since I usually play fallout on easy and never on survival. 
---
Sounds like SBQ
---
It's ridiculous how often I spend entire play sessions just gathering and scrapping junk.
---
It's the only reason I have enough material to craft anything or to bulk junk to sell for caps.  But for atom's sake, they need to increase the effing Vendor Caps limit. (cap, eh heh...). Especially since they've increased the price of the plans!  Seriously... WTH... Sigh...
---
If they make a separate server JUST for PVP then that shouldnt be a problem. Just as in WoW, people will know what they are getting themselves into. 
---
Being irradiated in this game can have surprising effects, I won't spoil it and neither should anyone else. Finding out like I did, on accident, is best. There's currently a glitch in the Radworm disease where it'll apply it's %50 modifier to pretty much all your buffs and debuffs so it can bite ya in the ass too
---
1st things 1st. Find some glue and a globe. They are junk items. Scrap them, go the junk tab in the pipboy. Hit option for component view. Select adhesive and screws and tag them for search. Any time you hover over a piece of junk in Appalachia, if it has a magnifying glass icon beside it, it will contain either adhesive or screws. Prioritize this junk over all others. Never de-tag these components. Thank me in 100 hours :)
---
Um...
---
Rifles are the only class of items carried that don't have any weight reduction perks.  Adding a card might be a lot more complicated than you think,  so changing an existing Perk may be an effective method.
---
How you got to calling me "toxic" and a "liar" over this is jaw dropping. 
---
Yea. Second example here. :/
---
 I spent my 2 months spec'd entirely in non power armor. Which you still pretty much have to use in the bunker/brood mother zone no matter what(Even more card swapping yay!). But colonel gutsy eats through you no matter what you do. 
---
Where? Because it’s not there when I try to craft it.
---
I started collecting anti armor legendary weapons Friday , spent the weekend trying them out. Any gun that can get an armor piercing magazine mod is awesome, and heavy weapons with stabilized and anti armor legendary effect are awesome. Anti armor 10 mm pistol with piercing magazine, hunting rifle, I don't know all off the top of my head. I hope this does not get us another nerf.
---
havne't had much fun on FO76 lately... all the perk and weapon nerfs and endless grinding of mats needed to repair the ever quickly degrading weapons and armor has take quite a bit of the fun out of it for me... Not to mention the constant supply management and always being over encumbered... LOL! I would rather they fix the bugs and the lack of loot that drops from bosses than nerf half the Perk Cards I use LOL! Anthem was a blast for me. I didn't play Destiny and given all the issues my friends and family had with it when it first came out and having ot buy crazy expensive DLCs I'm glad I didn't. I know Destiny 2 is better but after not playing 1 I never got into 2 either. 
---
I'm pretty sure there's some mechanic though wear heavier armor reduces your sneak chance
---
I always wear my power armor so...
---
Are u on rite now?
---
Be careful traveling near high lvl players most of the enemies will be their level oh and dont go rushing to a new location the zones are leveled 
---
I don't myself at the same spot, around level 30, and now it feels grindy.  I find myself doing material and vendor runs.  Probably the last 1/4 of my game has been pretty much pure resource grinding, material billing, vendor selling, etc.  During this time, I've completely stopped going through any of the quests.  I can't tell you how long it's been since I did any of the quest line.  In no Fallout have I ever done any grinding.  I avoid those types of games on purpose, and here I am grinding away to basically deal with what are effectively poor design elements.  I don't mind working for a reward, but mindless grinding isn't fun.  The need to deal with the game setup gets in the way of play, and that's something you never want.
---
Should have had push to talk from the start honestly. I know some people who don't read patch notes and never knew it is an option now. 
---
It's not their fault. There should be a modifier in place based on level so their showing up doesn't make the SBQ overly powerful. 
---
Holy moly that's so cool ! I cant wait to see all these modifications or mutations lol when I played fallout 4 a always wished I could add synth parts to me like Kellogg did. Now in 76 I can become a dang super mutant lol 
---
I think if more players were good at "sandboxing" like this, less people would be angry about the game.
---
Yeah, my 200+ damage double barrel shotgun should not leave a level 21 glowing molerat as anything but a fine pink mist with a contact shot to the head.
---
Sturdy and light combat armor do just fine. 
---
I understand your frustration. I made it this far and have seen multiple improvements. I think I can stick with it as I am enjoying the game, and needed a little break from Fallout 4 (I still play FO3, FNV, Skyrim and FO4 on a regular basis.).
---
Or even better maybe some dlc mission where you somehow get plans to build deathclaw mods to your existing PA. Dont how lore friendly it would be. 
---
it's an RPG that plays like a FPS...  
---
If it were solely a FPS it would have literally no reason to exist.
---
They're really nice and relatively easy to acquire from level 25 onwards. They don't provide a lot of extra protection, but they do provide an extra 100 lbs of carry-weight, which allows you to haul around a lot of weapons and whatnot, so I kind of think of them as a bit of a glasscannon armour in that sense. Even at level 170 I'm still trucking around in my souped-up level 45 excavator armour pretty regularly. 
---
(You can and should also check the vendors at Welsh, Camden Park and the responders HQ in Grafton for plans for mods for the exavator suit so you can fairly easily fix it up with some nice extra features)
---
i am from WV and the Flatwoods monster is usually a UFO/ alien encounter thing, some stories its an actual 'monster' but it's usually an alien 
---
&gt;I can't find enough ballistic fiber to even have a full set of armor equipped at once. I can't save enough caps to buy the fibers from a vendor. I can't stay alive without armor. I have to carry multiple weapons of multiple ammo types because I can't find/craft enough ammo to keep up with one type. I'm around level 30 and it takes like four hits to kill a level 5 super mutant. Because I'm carrying multiple weapons around I become overweight quickly and can't get away from enemies who are destroying me because my armor and weapons are all broken. 
---
odd. the quickest way i found to allow myself to sell as much things as possible was buying bulks of ballistic fibre (they cost 370 caps, giving the vendor a return of 92 caps). now i sit on 10 bulks and over 100 scraps.
---
there must be entire worlds of difference in how we play or something because i cannot understand how junk would be inaccessible. the stuff is literally everywhere.
---
question, but do you make notes of locations that contain materials you need? for example, there's a place with 3 military-grade duct tapes that give 15 adhesive and 6 ballistic fibre. if i find any other location with a concentration of ballistic fibre, i'll make a note of that location, and add it to my farming runs. with 5 gyms located, getting lead is easy - one of those gyms are bound to have their equipment left. toy stores provide you with screws and adhesive. some places have a lot of plastic concentrated - billiard pool tables with their plastic balls i.e. - and if you mark these locations down, making one or two trips to get the required material is a trivial matter.
---
i feel like the only way you could run out of materials is if you do \*not\* grind. like, at all. i mean, when i help my friend powerleveling (he likes making new characters), i run around with a machete and farm ammo. admittedly, i do run out of ammo, but on the other hand, i do have a lot of weapons. so when i start running low on one set of ammo, change your weapon load-out to another one that uses a different set of ammo; then when you've gathered up a nice sum of ammo, you can swap back.
---
for example, i usually run assault rifles/handmade (5.56 ammo), single action revolver/.44 gun (.44 ammo) and shotgun (shells). but when i run out of ammo (primarily in 5.56 which is the main weapon) i swap out to hunting rifle (.308/.50), 10mm gun/SMG, etc. there's also the combat and radium rifle (.45 ammo), but since i usually give away all mine to my friend, i tend to not use those weapons. there are other rifles you could use for a rifle build too, so finding a secondary weapon set you like shouldn't be hard at all.
---
one more question. do you use those perks - white knight, luck of the draw, etc?
---
Another suggestion that I saw in another thread was to give the vendors a pool of 1400 caps (200 \* 7 days) that resets weekly at a set day and time.
---
Oh good that's definitely what I'll most likely be running!!
---
Cool idea and execution. 
---
Melee will always pretty much be a one shot if not in power armor 
---
LOL, fake video! We all know that he could shot that thing for a day and wouldn't do nothing. The right thing to do would be charging it with an old board, acording to fallout its the right way to take out a target.
---
I wonder if mixing one of each size of purifier would increase the rate (if by chance each type has its own counter), or if the small ones would just slow down the big one (one shared counter for the whole camp).
---
I agree. I think what may happen is that Vault 76 will turn into a trader hub essentialy. Since its free travel and everyone knows where it is. Then you could sell junk, ammo, and aid to new players as well. And, since its free fast travel, everyone could go whenever they liked. Or maybe even all the vaults become a trader hub. Or the inside/outside of whitespring.
---
Rifles are meant for stealth. 
---
Grab the bonus stealth damage perks, put a suppressor on it, and pick off everything before they even know where you are. 
---
And a tip: you still deal bonus damage while in caution, even if they're shooting in your general direction. Add mysterious stranger in there, too, and he'll just pop out and distract them for you while you continue killing anything in the area. 
---
I was just curous, but tbf Getting hateful comments and hate mail for 24/7 would want me to take a small break for a change. I mean have you read the comments on their twitter posts?
---
What the hell, you guys play way to much lol, or just have way better luck than me, which is not saying that much... but myself I truly upset by the fact that there is no display cases, In F4 I had my mags my heads and my own place for each of my tricked out PA.
---
Wow.  This should be a real thing.  Maybe with some additional perks to make it more deathclaw like.  Something like speed demon perk enabled or if it's a melee build martial artist automatically unlocked.  
---
Enjoy, my favorite one is probably speed demon right now, extra 20 to run speed.
---
Somebody has to drink all that Nuka Dark rum.
---
Oh okay !! I cant wait to see one for myself lol too excited! I though that maybe the deathclaws were gonna be the biggest baddies. Glad there is something that makes them look like baby lizards lol 
---
I'm sorry, i feel you haven't actually ever run servers. Correct me if im wrong. You don't seem to have a clue how much processing is involved. 
---
This should be addressed
---
realistically speaking, with sneak (perk) and high agi you could probably sneak satisfactorily in power armor.
---
I'll definitely try my best !!
---
Good point.... Now I'm scared...
---
I takes like less than a week to hit lv 50 if you just xp grind with buddies... 
---
A knife while naked?
---
the lighter the armor, the better your sneak. for optimal results, use wood.
---
or nothing at all.
---
Don't forget to repair to 200% for the damage boost! 
---
Gosh that sounds so cool !! Ik definitely gonna be a mutant Haha thanks for telling me about this !!
---
Yeah you're right! it's not that guns are pathetically weak it's melee that's the issue.^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
Interesting ! Yeah I'm super excited and cant wait to see all these mutations!!
---
I can kill a bloated glowing one with 2 sneak shots with my non legendary hunting rifle. Your doing something wrong.
---
I know the "quad" on a crossbow does noting, the magazine of 1 is multiplied by 4, and gives 1 :(
---
I have encountered the flatwoods monster once and i think i found mine in cranberry bog maybe?  i have also found 4 different types of the mothman.
---
Tedious is more and more common.
---
You are showing extraordinary patience in the face of lesser wits haha. Good man.
---
I'll make sure this is the first thing I do !! Thank you so much!
---
Imagine if your cable company screwed up your internet service and went on vacation for the weekend.
---
Even worse come Monday you don't even get a fix.
---
You tried to run past the edge of the map? We are surrounded by the most insidious wall of them all: the pop up text wall.
---
What armour? I've never even heard of wood
---
Other side of the fence here, not played in over a month,.
---
Should probably point out that i actually enjoyed the game and think despite it's bugs, there's a lot going for it (has one of the best playerbases i've come across ever) that being said.... I'm close to max stash and i've got max caps, and a few of the quest lines i want to finish are bugged (i've logged on every update bar the last to see if they've been fixed), i planned on farming legendary's but i'd essentially be farming to drop items, so there's not much reason for me to jump back on at the moment, hopefully soon they increase stash sizes/cap limit and fix the quest bugs so i can play again :)
---
It's also good if you have to repair your weapons mid-fight.
---
You can't use a repair bench in PA.  Exiting normally just about kills you.
---
But with a hazmat suit on underneath, it instantly swaps to hazmat when you get out, so you can go repair.
---
My hot keys all refuse to work if I'm facing an enemy, I have to turn around fire stimpack, change weapon or chem then turm back :/
---
OK... No offence .. but if you want an easy game... try bump and jump for the atari 2600... 
---
Oh okay will do! Normaly I go pretty slow and explore all of the towns and all, but I'll make sure not to stray to far lol 
---
I haven’t bought the game, yet. I was waiting to see if it turns around. In your experience- with the game in its current state, should I purchase it? 
---
I don't know if I believe this. I'm often detected while sneaking with all perks and I have 15 agility... I am not wearing leather armor, albeit. 
---
That would be great too. 
---
It's curious how I've had more fun during the beta than now
---
Valley Galeria is superb for this if you haven't visited. 
---
And in exchange for your 21,000 caps, you get a recipe for something that only takes up .25 weight and sells for 200 caps, meaning you'll make your money back within 3 weeks or less of just vendoring serums (and they still sell to other players for over twice what you get for vendoring them), while also having the utility of being able to give yourself the mutation again at will, without playing the rads game.   
---
TL;DR: there's a reason it's priced that high. Caps are incredibly over-inflated in the economy already.  Reducing prices would exacerbate the problem. 
---
For mutations wait till you get starched Gene's and go to the mine next to white springs. There is a decontamination shower just inside and radiation barrels outside. Plan your character using an online planner- nukes and dragons. If you wait to get event legendaries they will scale with lv. Save screws.
---
This VATS missing initial shots constantly is an issue I can confirm.
---
It is their fault. It’s just also the designer’s fault. 
---
I’ve been scrapping the level 20 ones hoping to see a higher level one. Now I know. 
---
Show me.
---
Deathclaws are here and they are lets say a more noble enemy, while scorchbeasts are now just irritating, because it just flies around and constantly spams you with it's sonic attack, so you don't see anything... And the reward after killing it is just, so small... that it shouldn't even be considered as a reward...
---
Theres no way Im reading this. Have a good one
---
Once it gets full or near full just craft up a ton of ammo for your weapons and then craft a bunch of weapons/armor to breakdown for mods.
---
Then sell off any junk that has value (anything over 6 caps can be sold to vendors, makes for easy vendor capping).  Then I just drop off all my excess junk at the nearest overseer's cache or vendor cash register.
---
I don't really need that 900 cloth.  And that 850 Steel from that last mission is better used as Ammo and/or craft/scrap for mods.
---
And that 500 Fertilizer is worthless for the most part.  Might as well drop all but 75-100 of them off for someone to pick up thinking they struck it big!
---
There are very few things I keep more than say.... 150 of.  Lead, Steel, Gunpowder, Plastic, Screws.  Anything with actual value (can be sold to vendors).  Anything with zero value and no purpose gets dropped if over about 100 for space savings.
---
Well playing naked in God mode is certainly optional. I wouldn't advise it though.
---
Definitely don't attempt to go commando with a commando build nowadays.
---
I guess, but it's very likely a lot of them don't realize that they're making the SBQ harder to fight. It's not explained anywhere and there are a lot of players that don't read this subreddit. 
---
It's almost like open betas could be an incredibly useful tool if they hadn't been repeatedly abused by companies to bring in money as a feature instead of as a tool.
---
Op was posting about their twitter silence (which seems to be ended). Twitter posting doest mean they are or aren’t working on fixes. 
---
Wow, yeah that sounds like you are having more than one of the issues all at the same time, not sure which ones, and it can be that it's different ones at different times with the same out come.
---
Yes you just have to be early
---
inb4 hotfix
---
If they made this game ANYTHING like ESO I would have enjoyed it much more.
---
See, if Bethesda put *THAT* in their Atom store, it might turn a head or two. Unlike the rainbow vomit we've been getting so far. 
---
A “by design” list would be gold for this community. Imagine having a complete list of issues raised and a status next to them!? 
---
By Design
---
Agreed - scheduled for Feb Patch
---
Fixed
---
Broken again - scheduled for hot fix
---
I wish they would fix the real problems instead of “let’s just nerf it”. Everything would’ve been fine if demolition expert didn’t effect legendary effects.  Cap stash change was a big fuck up. Weight reduction cap killed legit player vendors, and real collectors. You still can’t even inspect items during trades (that seems pretty fucking important and hasn’t been addressed since when?). Daily and events still have bugs that don’t show it has started or doesn’t progress further into mission. Server lag, double loading screen, game crashes and invisible players due to server connection are still everyday problems. Like duping created that problem... total b.s. I wouldnt mind if duping was still a thing if they just fixed all of the real stuff first. Oh and as for duping, after all of your worthless attempts to shut it down and fix the “glitch”. A method still exists as of last patch. 
---
no no, quad works my friend but you have to click reload after every bolt is loaded and it will load up to 4 in the chamber. Unfortunately the crossbow has no mods and caps at level 35 disappointingly...
---
I’m mystified too 👍
---
All these folks hating the game... please leave. Let the apalachoan wasteland feel like a wasteland, and go play fortnite, or battlefront, or whatever those pvp whiners like to play.
---
Once you are "One of us", you can use the servants entrance hand scanner behind Whitesping and also the secret entrance on the 3rd floor of the resort to get into the bunker.
---
I saw it on a loading screen a couple updates ago but I don’t know if it’s there anymore haven’t seen it in a couple weeks
---
Nothing behind them. Possibly future content. 
---
It isn't an MMO if you don't see anyone real for hours except as points on the world map sir. 
---
I care about 10mm SMG =( I actually find it more viable than the Minigun
---
Someone nearby who was not on my team used berry mentats and I was able to see myself glowing over the weekend. He was on voice and we talked about it and figured it out. 
---
Nope, this armor made from humans fear
---
My executioners explosive minigun is still incredibly powerful post nerf. Once they are below 40% hp they just simply melt away. 
---
Let's build a Vault just to house FO76, then erase its location forever.
---
Is there a plan for deep pocketed combat armor?
---
Yeah I've dealt with all the bugs and disconnects and just keep coming back because the best experiences I've had so far in this game have been when I run into a cool person or group of people and team up and just run through shit for hours. Talking to people from hundreds or thousands of miles away and getting a peak at what societal differences they have vs what I see every day. This is my first open world online game and I love it for this aspect
---
Communication with the customer shouldn't stop either.
---
If your internet went down and you called your provider to find out what was going on......you would expect there to be someone to communicate with you. At least I would.
---
When I'm bored I sometimes hang out in the Forest in my cultist outfit and recruit newbies. We then proceed to the museum to harvest eggs and get them their own outfit in the basement. Then I enter photomode and go into lotus pose in front of the altar thingy.
---
All while off mic, of course, because my raspy, drunky voice would ruin it.
---
I'm level 184 so as you can imagine, trying to lure strangers to an unknown location using only emotes doesn't work very often. But the few times new players have gone for it, it's been fun little role play.
---
Since it doesn't appear to be mentioned yet...
---
It appears now that if I have bulk items in my inventory and I "scrap all junk" at a bench it will scrap the stuff I already bulked. Didn't do that pre-patch5
---
Good point. Duper’s have way more motivation to lie here than Bethesda. 
---
Funny you should say that I’ve been giving the alcohol bonus strength some serious thought with the perk as I’ve got a couple of perk points spare to spend and there seems to be quite a bit of alcohol around the map 
---
Yes, from FO2
---
A *used* controller. Not even a new one. lol
---
95% of my friends list says "offline" even in prime time now.
---
They need more CONTENT.  Even small changes like making "some" of the events spawn SUPER variants.  Like AWOL Armaments becoming SUPER AWOL Armaments occasionally.  4 times the health, 2 times the damage, 6 waves instead of 3, with at least TWO guaranteed 3 Star Rewards.  You'd burn a ton of stimpacks, ammo, and a lot of repair needed.........but you'd at least feel justified in re-grinding those items because the rewards were good.
---
I usually just run all 3 satellite dishes (National Astronomy Research Center i think, Sugar Grove and something Satellite Array, they are right next to eachother), they contain about 30 screws each in fans, phones and typewriters and you get tons of clipboards and pens as well for lead and screws.
---
Same.
---
That actually sounds like a good idea to me about armor durability on NPCs. 
---
Just have armor scale down with HP% so at 50% health they have 50% of their base/original armor, down to a minumum of perhaps 20% of base armor.
---
Or have a set number of hits that are affected by full armor, that way high ROF weapons deal less at first but much more after the armor is broken, while say a Sledgehammer will have to deal with the full armor for every hit.
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.  That legendary mod would act just like a weapon / armor mod (a one time use to attach to any weapon / armor).
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
That is true, but more adds and scaling difficulty with additional players is relatively common in online games. 
---
Personally, I’m fine with people coming as long as they try. 
---
I would say a big number hate Beth for just that or are we to ignore all the pre beta bashing of the concept. Endless posts condemning the game and Beth for ”fallout 4 online”, ”no human npcs” and so on?
---
Or was it all a dream? 😀
---
No idea. Cap stashes and cap collector are fucked right now.
---
You can tell that my comment was obviously making fun of your stupid comment.
---
My CPU is averaging around 52% while playing and Memory is pegged at about 62% of 15.9GB ddr3.
---
Seems OK, I do only have an *msi 750 ti Maxwell* too, power is 70w max I think pci-e slot not 4pin power, gpu runs at 100% but runs cool though. Have my graphics settings at medium and grass turned off in fallout76custom.ini plus some other tweaks.
---
I'm thinking then from reply below just network lag, game proccessing lag etc.
---
Not a big issue I suppose, just being a bit OCDish.
---
How the hell it aint? You are f#cking level 30 and you come to fight with strongest monster that is supposed to be endgame boss. This is like me when I started playing WoW and I had shitty gear, I joined Heroic Dungeon (instead normal) because I could... I got kicked right away and I learned from it. Sometimes because you can, doesn't mean you should.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Wood_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
the logic behind "leather is the best for sneaking" is based off two things: leather is (was) the lightest and has mods for better sneak in the dark *or* faster sneaking while crouched.
---
wood is lighter and has a mod for both dark sneak **AND** faster sneak.
---
I might have overstated when I said PA, but with a full unyielding set you're essentially invisible. I can snuggle up with a Deathclaw and it takes seconds before it even notices me.
---
so maybe not PA, but definitely Combat/Marine.
---
So you have to hit reload 4 times, and then it can shoot 4 arrows without reloading?
---
You have to start letting go of the things you can't sell, like all those mini nukes, half-empty fusion cores, missiles, and other ammo you've been saving for a rainy day.
---
In a few levels. Then a few levels after that you go back to running away from them, because their loot isn't worth the ammo you have to spend killing them.  
---

Mutfruit looks really well with the camp fire underneath it.
---
Lol, we are kindred spirits.  One of my faves is to look around for tanks and cars near enemies and target the tank or vehicle.  I run stealth sniper build with suppressed so usually it explodes before they get away.  
---
It was a joyous day when I realized I could blow up stuff.  
---
😁
---
I got 5 straight melee sneak crits vs the SBQ in PA yesterday, totally doable with perks, and I only have 10 agi. 
---
Never had a problem with Ballistic Fiber.  Just keep killing Molemen and grabbing their stuff.  Do a Uranium Fever run and you'll get plenty.
---
this is really the problem. things break too quick. if they lasted double the time (or whatever), none of these things would be that much of a problem (which would make it all overall less tedious).
---
like, i think the idea of spending 1-2 hour resupplying is good - i like it personally - but then you should be able to play aggressively at least the same amount of time it took preparing for it.
---
 Nice to hear a compliment from a professional. I unfortunately just dilettant 
---
Thanks, does look like just one of those things.
---
People are bored. Sorry man, but it’s happens to us all. Did they at least have caps on them so you could get something out of killing them? 
---
I just want the plastic afterwards.
---
Yep, it starts with 4 bolts in the clip, then when you fire them all it will only reload one bolt. You have to hit reload 3 more times to load them into the crossbow, then you can fire all 4 again
---
Problem though is they upped the costs on guaranteed plans too. 
---
You're a proper cunt aren't ya mate

Hey I just encountered a bug where my dog I named mud pile turned inside out from his asshole and exploded into this amalgamation of polys and garbage. My grandson was watching and called for daddy even though he went to the store for one of them vaps? I think th hey are called. Anyway just let that s.o.b beta Male Todd Howard that his game is a pile of amalgamated poly garbage 
---
Deathclaw inside =)
---
Mini nukes are absolutely worthless against the SBQ.  
---
Reserved for possible future content, like that portal that was in SW forever.
---
Thanks!
---
Stagger breaks Sentinel, and there’s lots of ways to trigger staggers. I don’t know about reliable 1shot staggers, but melee power attacks usually stagger. 
---
Is your camp next to the golf club and has tons of turrets?
---
Right, same here. People should be encouraged to come, not penalized for doing so. Maybe give a damage buff to lower levels, as well as not buffing the SBQ as I mentioned. There's a way to do it, but I'm not holding my breath. 
---
I would /love/ to see a combined effort in rebuilding a city, like Charleston for example. That’s kind of what the Overseer is telling the vault dwellers to do, isn’t it? I thought before the game came out c.a.m.p.s would be a joint effort. 
---
I really enjoy the game, but I’m getting to the same point as everyone else.
---
Any idea where is spawns/sells?
---
Yea exactly this - the advancement simply grinds to a halt is doesn’t feel like playing but „working“
---
And I don’t enjoy working ... at least not for free and even less if I had to pay for it 
---
Oh hey I think that's mine! I feel so honored!
---
Thank you.
---
Survival mode in fo4 increased damage dealt by a large amount both for enemies and players but yeah. The dr system screws low dmg weapons
---
I’m about half way done with one right now. Hope to have it done by tomorrow. I’ll let you know and share it when I’m finished.
---
So the majority of the game is spent running away from them? Noted.
---
Try a hazmat suit, any full set of power armor (with some radX) or use the Rad Sponge perk card and share it with a team member.
---
I don't remember, but it is just deep pocketed combat armor. It will work for light, sturdy and heavy.
---
I just want them Mr. Fuzzy tokens...
---
Unfortunately I was never able to find a fix for this game so I had to end up uninstalling it. Which sucks cause I really wanted to play the game. Best of luck trying to find a fix though. 
---
I am guessing they wont be much different than the random locations we have currently. Whats worse is I doubt they will be instanced since nothing else is, meaning every server for the first week or two is going to have people flooding these new locations. So good luck getting the intended experience anyways despite it being good or not, people will be running ahead killing everything or griefing people trying to read the new terminals.
---
Prove me wrong bethesda.
---
It's not a fix but I found that if you only have two you need to choose between then putting a skin on one of them that comes from the Atom shop gives the frame the atom symbol. So I painted my X-01 armor "Tricentennial" and now that frame has the atom symbol, my excavator set doesn't. Doesn't help if you have more than just two though.
---
Someones doing the raiding.
---
Jump in power armor and grab a few melee weapons.  It's what bethesda wants, going by the current state of affairs.  It's not fun, but I think it solves most/all of the problems your having.
---
Also, I agree that this is a bad state for the game to be in.  Bethesda, make armor/guns viable.
---
No problem, trying to round up a 10 Charisma Character to do more extensive testing. Stay tuned
---
Personally I feel like heavy weapons should just have a decent chunk of armor penetration built in just for starters.
---
bruh do u have a link to that thread? lol
---
some killed him before I could. I think if some one is going to destroy that much stuff they should have a 100+ cap bounty.
---
Where's Marine?
---
If you can survive, why shouldn't you be able to join? If your presence had no bearing on the difficulty of the battle, there wouldn't be an argument for you not to be there.
---
The loot is instanced, so assuming the event gets fixed so that low level players don't boost the SBQ so much, they should be able to help.

Super. Thanks.

I don't understand why people are willing to put up with a bad game just because they've loved previous entries or the company. I was a huge fan of Halo and when the first Destiny came out, I was immediately turned off. Company worship isn't a good thing and more people need to realize this like OP. Companies don't care about you.

I had a similar glitch wearing a bowler and an empty power armor frame. Equip bowler, get into power armor, remove bowler, and poof! There goes my most of my hair!

holy shite.. same here. 
---
Having a fallout based game with ESO mechanics would be awesome.
---
Best part is they can give all their caps to a mule. And it doesn’t matter how high they bounty is. If they don’t have the caps on their account you can’t collect the bounty 
---
Yeah, no chance ford upping with this idea 😂
---
Yeah lol.. I had to laugh at that, you are not alone sir, it JUST happened to me like three or four days ago.
---
Logged into the game cause my woman loves checking out the scenery and stuff while I'm playing an showing her a quest I'm doing then BAM! Nuke hits.. I'm insta dead. 
---
Log into another spawn point there not too far but outside the area..  BAM! Dead again from radiation.  
---
I had to go to a point like way far away, moved my camp but then my luck.. another Nuke drops. And it hits over at the bottom where I put my new camp, lol. 
---
And to boot the new area I chose.. well yours truly put it right smack by the scorched main starting area id say, had to be that or their convention center.. 
---
Damn things no matter what kept spawning like cockroaches and destroyed my turrets and all my defenses haha. 
---
But I keep a trucking away at it.  Just not every day like before, or else it would have me raging. 
---
You're assuming Bethesda actually put forth the effort to add in a new armor system given how much stuff from 4 got ported over, bugs intact. Plus I keep seeing the exact problems from 4 regarding armor pop up everywhere.
---
I have vsync OFF and AA application controlled in nvidia control panel so I'm guessing FO76 is managing this and it's ON, not sure I could live with all the zaggies. I get a fair amount of tearing but mostly while looking and panning at doors for some reason and while inside interior cells. Vsync off made a nice improvement to smoothness and stopped micro stutters.
---
I'm going to turn OFF AA in nvidia control panel and see if it helps.
---
Thanks for the suggestions :)
---
&gt; funny
---
Why do people keep using funny to mean fun? Pretty sure design features aren't supposed to make you laugh.
---
Check again in 2020. It'll either be much better or shut down. Either is better than its current state.
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request. 
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited or however high they can get it (1,000, 10,000, etc). It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
And one of the more advanced versions of these round, the Rauffoss .50 cal round, retails at $1000 bucks a pop. So maybe not the best example to set for Beth ;D
---
Sent you a friend request on xbl. Couldn't get on before, Dad life stuff. 
---
I usually play at night after work. 
---
You *don't* think the building system is unnecessarily convoluted?
---
Bethesda should rot in hell for what they have done 
---
Cap stash now works same as other containers in the game like chem/ammo/food the stash box will be there but stay empty until 20hrs 
---
I think it was mentioned somewhere that [everyone in all vaults are dead one way or another.](/spoiler)
---
I highly doubt they'll add alive human NPCs to the game even though I wish they did.
---
without photos there are no tests, maybe they just wanted to get attention 
---
r/whooosh
---
I see your wisdom of not building the extractors. I had my suspicions and had come to that conclusion on my own but i really needed and appreciate your validation of that theory.
---
To be fair I thought I had a good idea what I was doing when I started and didn't figure out how far away I was until lvl 40ish
---
Oh there will be a part three. Still gotta find out the perfect time to post on this subreddit tho. 
---
I have a cap stash at my CAMP location, and it seems that I've been able loot it every couple of days. I'll have to pay closer attention next time. 
---
I do know for sure that some cap stashes were flat out removed from the game after the last patch. My previous CAMP location also had one, but it disappeared after the patch (along with some static junk). 
---
Ok thanx
---
 Fight em'.  Their screech is just noise, most decent armor should have little problem with it. We all run from the gas attack and really persistence is what you need. 
---
 I shoot em' with a Lever Action till the land then kill em with a sword. 
---
 My first char killed one at level 30 although it took quite a while.
---
This needs to be the top post in it's own thread.
---
I'm tired of the server instability.  Even with the latest update it seems like every other day my game freezes on me. Let me explain, yesterday I started a game in the middle of the day and I'm playing along, killing a few enemies and starting to loot their bodies and.....frozen. ok turn off Xbox, load back in which takes an average of 4.5 minutes. Ok whack whack bam back to killing enemies and..... Frozen. Another 4.5 minutes whack, turn around and....frozen. this happens every other day. One day I tried for 2 hrs while getting 5 minutes of game play before the game glitched or crashed. They say they fixed some stability issues but why is checking inventory or looting causing crashed or freezes???? I truly enjoy the game but having these crashes on a constant basis is frustrating! I'm not sure if it's because of other players doing stuff that's causing the server to get bogged down or just plain server instability. But having to take 4.5 minutes to log into a game to play for 2-5 minutes and then crash is so so so so frustrating!!!! It seems like if I'm in my camp doing nothing I can go on for days without a crash but the second I start fighting a swarm of Ghouls and lose the chance at legendary drops I'm done for it. Also with the latest update if you are farming modus in whitesprings bunker you have to initiate modus for 5 minutes of him talking to access the vendor. So frustrating as it is because I've never come across even once x01 calibrated shocks, which I would love to have. Make it more available please please please Bethesda so people aren't server hoping in order to look for these items. Seems like server hopping can cause issues too
---
I like hard games, they are making it tedious, crafting bullets and repairing armor is a chore.
---
Just fyi, if you mod your Combat Armor chest to have a dense mod, it pretty much makes their damage go to zero on you as their circle blasts are considered explosive. You’ll take way less damage out of power armor with a dense CA chest on.
---
I wouldn’t mind if they reduced the number of players per server a bit if it meant a bigger stash, but if duper’s were walking around with hundreds of thousands of items on them to track through the world then a small stash increase should be viable once all their accounts are closed.
---
General consensus, pre-patch, is Grafton. Will do some server hopping tonight.
---
You are asking if burdensome laws that increase costs for creators influence the choices they make in developing products?  Welcome to Econ 101!
---
To be honest the fusion core thing makes sense, I always have too many and they weigh a ton so glad to get rid of them...
---
Or they could be a reasonable weight to start with 🤔
---
They don’t hit hard if u in PA and cuz I play melee it’s just annoying that I have to wait till it done spamming sonic waves and land on the ground. It takes less than 30s to kill as soon as it lands /shrug 
---
I'm sure stuff keeps producing while you are away. That's the whole reasoning behind small inventories. 
---
Actually, I am Mr Foot's agent...he is issuing a Cease and Desist on using his name without proper clearance. Here is the paperwork. You'll see it's all in order. You have 72 hours to rescind your post or we'll be seeing you in court.
---
Yes. If I wanted an impossible fallout game I'd have difficulty settings rather than have it set for me
---
Harder? Lol what? QUESTS?? Where are you finding theses quests I haven’t had quests since lvl 30.
---
If you’re new to Fallout I wouldn’t blame bugthesda. If your stuff keeps breaking invest in some Intelligence and Luck. Maxed out Gunsmith makes your guns break 50% slower and Lucky Break perks allow for a chance to fully repair armor and weapons on hit. Not to mention there’s also perks that allow you to repair up to 200%.
---
If your having trouble with enemy’s pick a gun type pistols/shorty/rifle/energy and stick with it and build your damage around your weapon of choice. Or find someone to trade you a TSE gun. Even after the nerf if your skill tree is setup correctly they still do LOADS of damage.
---
Even though I have a TSE and all the perk cards a girl could need, I still like the RNG roll idk why. I got excited the other day when I scored an explosive Assaultron Head, even knowing A) explosive has been nerfed and B) the stupid things are still broken. 
---
It's fun to me to do events with friends and see what crappy Legendaries we get. On that note, my friends are mainly what keep me coming back. I play with a few newer players (I've played since beta) and like being able to help them out with their quests and events as well as supplies.
---
The explosive nerf is now forcing me to reconsider my build which if I'm honest is a good thing because I was getting lazy just storming around one-shotting huge mobs. I still *can* but I've been doing more sneaking and less 'sploding.
---
Seriously. If your camp is outside the golf club, you are Hitler.
---
I think rifle because it’s in the name and only weighs 17
---
This right here is more accurate than I would like to admit
---
* all those robots around watoga drop steel/aluminum/lead 
---
* for springs go to the charleston capitol building (battered clipboards)
---
* wood scraps vault 76/overseers camp
---
* camp mclintock (ballistic fiber)
---
* in whitespring resport go to the spa theres bars of soap everywhere (oil)
---
* always check to toy store in whitespring for the toys on the ground (giddyup buttercup) toy blocks trucks
---
Welp, now he has to go grind for mats to repair it.
---
I've had this rant myself too many times.  I'm finally pushing through my 40s and it's getting "easier" 
---
 I had pretty much your exact same experience and I found that getting myself a couple of the nicer legendary weapons went a long way towards helping me stay alive and not want to shelf the game.   Also using the enforcer perk card helps a lot with crippling enemies legs so they're are slower than my encumbered ass.    My 600 pound life is not just a reality TV show its also my daily struggle in FO76. 
---
We should start a Preston Garvey Survivors support group
---
It’s probably the bunker for the alien blaster fusion mag plans. And they are trying to pull your chain 
---
I would have really loved to see the “harder” be redirected to the survival mode. 
---
Let the main game be approachable to all, and if you want a harder time, turn it on!
---
Also, survival should be a one way move. You should it be able to go in and out of survival. Once in survival you are locked into it. Want out of survival, make a new character. 
---
I saw a video where a guy debunked that your budget increases when you level. It appears that items use less budget as you level. Video is 2 months old so patches could have changed things.

Does the fire rate help at all? 
---
I've been doing the poseidon energy plant run and they have all remained empty for 30+ hours. Starting to irritate me lol
---
I'd describe it as less fun than a trip to the dentist. Worst game I've played in a long time... which sucks, because I feel like the bones of the game could have really made for something fun and interesting. 
---
I killed by first scorchbeast in level 40s: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P1KvaL-ZIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P1KvaL-ZIY) .  If you can get it to land, which it sometimes does, and you have a weapon, whether a shotgun or melee, that deals about 170-200 damage per hit into its face, then it is a doable thing.  You would need to 30-40 shotgun shots, so a melee weapon is often preferred.  A power armor is almost a must because of the high damage you would have to take.
---
[I already did.](https://imgur.com/gallery/joF2KPs)
---
The NPC part is annoying because the "No NPCs" was said ALOT throughout the marketing.
---
Flat damage reduction is a great system for making a game where weapons that fire fast for low damage like machineguns are good against lightly armored targets and things like missiles that fire slowly but do a lot of damage are good at taking out heavily armored targets. It's just not a good system when every target is heavily armored.
---
Yup. Great for clearing adds though. Two Shot Fatman ftw! 
---
Dunno if AA would add this much latency on its own. Is there anything between your mouse adapter and the mouse itself?
---
Go search eBay. I’ll wait here.
---
Wow! An excellent network and a top tier PC and you get these lags, it must then be just something we have to live with while playing an online game. I'm still amazed that any of this stuff works anyway, all this silicon tech inside our home computers.
---
Alien technology, mark my works!
---
I had a red sentry bot go up to me and call me it's commander. It started following me across the mire, and I was planning to take it home until we got jumped by three scorchbeasts. Diabolos (my sentry bot) basically aggroed them while I ran away cause I was level 30 some. It came back later with less than a quarter of it's health, pissed, and calling me an imposter so I had to put him down. The worst part is that it completed a challenge for killing 1k robots. Rip diabolos my savior and 1000th robot kill.
---
Bullets and junk isn't the problem.  For database retrieval it's a line item name and a quantity.  Whether that's 10 steel or 1,000 steel the database retrieves both in essentially the same amount of time.
---
It's the things with legendary modifiers and condition bars that's the problem.  In theory you could have 1,000,000 different variants of combat shotguns in your inventory.  The database has to take enormous amounts of time to not only find those items, but load them individually with all the right mods, perks, and condition bar sizes.  
---
That's most likely why they're having spinny circle problems in the nuke zones.  Too many enemies dying too fast with too many other players present.  The database is lagging trying to add items to enemy piles based on how many people tagged that enemy.  If 10 people hit that one windigo, it's got to find and load 10 people's worth of loot into that one body.
---
This ^^
---
And that’s exactly why I stopped playing.. I tried so hard to keep playing this game because I’ve always been such a fan of the fallout games. And on top of that, my boyfriend had never played a single one but was so excited to play 76 with me. And boy did that go well. He’s already said he would never purchase another game from Bethesda. 
---
The game just got to a point where there was absolutely no more content left to explore and the content we had already done has been made so tedious that we just wouldn’t bother with it. Playing this game felt more like work instead of actually being able to enjoy a game.  For a little while, I genuinely thought they might actually fix things, but it’s just worse with every patch. Instead of banning the players who keep exploiting the glitches, they just continue to punish the people that actually enjoy playing this keep. It’s incredibly sad, but I definitely will not be coming back to this game unless some serious fixes are made. 
---
I was about the same, lvl 30-35ish.  Wasn't worth the hassle to be honest. Post lvl 50 in PA they are just a nuisance. I usually shoot them down now just to get them to shut up.
---
Opens it up to manipulation.  Mostly on PC.
---
Here for my obligatory fuck Bethesda
---
 i get head shots all the time, but I never ever use VATS. 
---
 Ran into it in Fallout 3 and decided it was cheating. ;) Several thousand hours later I have managed to dominate all the 3D Fallout games without it.
---
Yes. I’ve enjoyed the game and played quite a bit, but I’m really at the end  right now. I’m level 73 and a level 50 scorchbeast was beating the ever-living crap out of me. It was a constant barrage of attack and I couldn’t do anything really. I’ve lost my junk so many times from dying and then getting disconnected, or worse it just disappeared altogether. I’ve been overencumbered  since the game came out with a few, short lived times of reprieve. I’ve explored the vast majority of the map, which I’ve enjoyed, but there’s not a lot to do now. I spend the vast majority of my time building my c.a.m.p., but that’s even more tedious with the snapping problems, things not wanting to place, etc. 
---
I really want more out of this game. I have a strange loyalty to this game because I live like an hour away from Camden Park irl, and it makes me sad that a game is finally set basically where I live and is not great and not improving. 
---
:D
---
&gt; but that's an MMO
---
Funny thing is I'm surprised you actually brought up the term MMO and didn't slap it on this game since apparently everyone here suddenly decided that this game is now an MMO with its 24 player servers...
---
Adventure mode should be 100% coop pve, (no wanted status, no damage to other players and structures including perk cards, no closing property)
---
Then survival mode Is the one mode that should have all the pvp features, full damage etc etc all players are potential raiders Rust type of game.
---
But how dose twitter connect to total internet loss? You can still play FO76.
---
Agreed. And the fun factor is through the roof!  I love hearing that whistle sound after you let one fly. 
---
In the early game I often passed up picking some junk that seemed useless, but came to seriously regret that decision later on. Specifically anything that has screws, springs, plastic, or lead is great to pickup. Clipboards, pencils, scissors, paint buckets, plastic forks/plates, etc.
---
If you like building your CAMP, do the Powering up Poseidon power plant event 3 times to get the plan for a fusion generator. It produces 100 power, compared to the next biggest one that only produces 10!
---
Adventure mode should be 100% coop pve, (no wanted status, no damage to other players and structures including perk cards, no closing property and no player to player Drama)
---
Theres still quests? 
---
I do think the building system is really fun.
---
I don’t think you have any other choice.
---
I don’t think it matters enough to worry about.
---
I do hope that there are people that get so worked up that their lives are worse for it. Because those people deserve the stress that they’ve created for themselves.
---
Over a video game.
---
I'm referring more to all the YouTube comments i see where people say the game is boring or lifeless, not necessarily complaining about the bugs which bethesda, thankfully, is trying to iron out with every update.  The bug gripes are understandable but I'm pointing out that the game still is remaining fresh for me still and manages to impress. This is just a example of some really cool thing is in the game. The people working on the game obviously put a lot of blood and sweat into it, unfortunately was rushed out the door

Patch 6 Notes:
---
Boulders have had damage reduced 75% to be inline with the damage of other rocks.
---
Dev notes: Boulders were doing excessive damage which made them must picks.  The damage reduction should make stones a more viable option for all builds.
---
That’s awesome! 
---
I’m pretty certain it’s bs. If there are YouTube videos of unfinished vaults and a dev room, but no alien bunker or hatch...yeah, it’s bs.
---
A wardrobe for apparel, a fridge for food and drink. It can't be that difficult to implement?

tuxedo bundle, Halloween costume and the silver shroud. I think i got the carpet floor too.

A black pip boy skin and a fruit hat. Nothing else has really appealed to me!

---
The mirv works I have an two shot mirv and the sight after is beautiful it honestly looks like a nuke dropped but smaller, kind of like a mini nuke :)
---
They have said many times they will do this. But when they feel it won’t cause the servers to be less stable.
---
Asking isn’t going to change that fact. I’m sure it’s one of the things top of their list.
---
Level 30 is nowhere near end-game.
---
That is so 8 years ago.These days us poor people use Discord.
---
Maybe they just want to enjoy the fact that they and maybe few others know about it as long as they can.
---
 In BOS Heavy Combat I did 3 level 80s at Whitespring yesterday. He is level 52 now. 
---
 I really enjoy the Scorchbeasts. I was yelling and several were laughing as I shouted "now this is fucking cake" as we wailed on em'.
---
I'm with you, it would have been even better but I'll still take 76, still fun for me.
---
You are not familiar with survival games are you? Grinding is a core feature in the.

I heard the sirens and it said nuclear launch imminent clear the area and started running and was freaking it. Nuke landed right when I ran 😅 my camp was right on the fringe of the blast zone so I had to hurry up and respawn and set a bunch of turrets because all the irradiated bullshit started coming at me and my health was nonexistent
---
I don't know what to tell you further. i sneak/run around with 3 level 1 rifle perks and 1 shot nearly everything in West Tek with a crafted HandMade rifle in VATS.
---
Count me in! And I'm sure there are more traumatized souls out there. 
---
actually I stopped with Patch 5. Only to see it got even worse with the next „fixes“
---
No, sadly. But the rest is still awesome. :)
---
Meh. I'd much rather have an ability based sci-fi game like Anthem over a gun based one like Destiny. The Storm makes the Warlock class look boring as shit.
---
That’s not going to make a difference. There’s s reason there’s a stash limit. That reason has to do with the number of items the severs can handle. 
---
Spitting it amongst different boxes won’t change how many items the servers can handle. 
---
 I can testify. My BOS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest is amazing. No damage from their screeching. ;)
---
Unlike walls has multiple sides and can snap and free drop.
---
There are different versions of Mothman a nonagressive one spawns at the light house west of Vault 76 if you finish his event.
---
what do you mean when you said that they nerfed xp three times? Like the overall xp or just like those glowing ghouls after a whitespring nuke?
---
Me too! Friday night I met a few guys and made friends after making it to level 49 on my own. It was funny too because I called myself a noob, but they kept asking how I was lvl 49 being a noob? Just because I was saying I was a noob to Fallout doesnt mean Im a noob to gaming in general and being a sniper in real life I am no noob to tactics and things like that. Another thing I found funny was he asked how old I was and when I said I would be 54 in March he was like, "Holy crap!!" just because he was 18, 54 is not old, we enjoy gaming too! :)
---
Yeah and how the view from the top of the excavator is actually a real time image of the world, kind of how the map in Skyrim was real time, like you could see the clouds on the map moving even.  Pretty impressive.  Can't wait for new elder scrolls
---
Explore everything 
---
But that's my point.  It's not designed to be a competitive shooter like the games you described there.  
---
It's an RPG with multiplayer elements.  A comparable I can't really think of off the top of my head, but not the ones you mentioned.  It has tons of content, and exhausting that is OK!  Expecting it to last forever is on the consumer.  
---
The game doesnt have a season pass, it doesn't have a subscription, it doesn't have a battle pass.  It has a box cost for the 50+ hours anyone who enjoyed the game will be able to get from it, and it has promise of new stuff to do down the line.  This is OK.  It doesn't need to have 1000+ hours of content for everyone in box price alone (though for many it does have that).
---
I mean, leveing a gun through crafting mechanic practically already exists. It's just that swapping reciever from .308 on the hunting rifle to the later game .50 actually lowers damage instead of increases it. I think we just need a lot more freedom in swapping caliber for all kinds of guns. If I wanted to make a top end combat rifle with a .50 receiver I should be able to, but rate of fire, recoil and accuracy would probably be ass.
---
Though all this is a problem because unlike the classic fallouts you can get increases to the damage of ranged weapons through stats and perks rather than just increase their accuracy.
---
Strength still allowed higher damage with melee weapons, while perception let you hit targets more often at your gun's maximum range and even counter the effects of cover. Meanwhile rushing into melee added the risk that pretty much anyone with a gun could hit all shots against you.
---
Tedious yes, I used to jump on once able after work every day and on the weekends, but after last patch (pre-hotfix) I've only gotten on twice in a week and don't plan to get on any time soon.  While I am a melee character first, the TSE nerf just made things really boring for some reason, I can't quite put my finger on why, but TSE's were just fun to play with.  Going back to melee has not been like a new experience, just was like it was at the game's first launch on day 1 when I started playing and can't say I missed that as I already played the heck out of that. 
---
says àaa pop
---
So THAT'S why they made the plastic outer shell.  It all makes sense now.
---
It was part of what was intended to be a market.  Its expensive so you can't buy them all, but you can buy one and make them to sell to others.  Except markets down work with 20 people playing solo in a huge world.
---
The first time I found that place there were 2 wendigos up there. This was a long time ago when I wasn't as tough or worldly and let me tell you, it required a quick trip to the vendors for a new pair of (British) pants... 
---
I LOL'd. 
---
Lately Im just being shot from 20 feet away by and explosive weapon. Im standing still. Shoot the guy. He shoots me twice I’m staggered then I die on the follow up shot. It’s like once the slap damage is done, I can’t damage him, I get staggered from being shot, I can’t stagger him with antiarmor, and then aim dead. I’m even being staggered with Explosive Shotguns.
---
Positive / Negative points don't affect what perk cards you can use.  So if you have intelligence of 5 you can still use 5 star perk cards even if your marsupial drops it to intelligence of 1.
---
Make sure you're using Class Freak, it gets rid of 75% of the negative effects of mutations.  Occasionally you can take that off to use Super Duper, Pharma Finder, etc.  Generally I keep it equipped most of the time.
---
Also if you plan on keeping your mutations, 2 Star Starched Genes is a 100% must have equipped all the time card.
---
tep , still working 
---
&gt;Imagine if your cable company screwed up your internet service and went on vacation for the weekend.
---
bro i have comcast. it's essentially in my contract
---
This is a fallout game. My rebuttal is to simply point you in the direction of the last 3 fallout titles... 
---
Yes there are survival elements. You can even opt to play in a more survival oriented mode, but Fallout has always been more of a RPG than a survival game. 
---
That's my point.  People are quitting way before the end game because they're bored.  The people on this sub are all in the endgame trying to discuss how to revive the game, meanwhile the vast majority of players who have quit were bored way before reaching the endgame.
---
PC, no power armor.
---
RISE UP
---
Yeah, the SBQ is sort of exempt from this.  I'm mostly referring to the standard Scorchbeasts.
---
I had exactly the same problem. I returned after the patch 5 and saw what happened. I then quit also because I didn’t invest hundreds of hours for now crappy guns 
---
I'm still salty about that. I didn't even know they did timed sales till I saw people with the paint job and was wondering where it was from, Since I never went into the Atomic Store.
---
Yep he sells plans and mods 
---
You worried they gonna steal your idea on damage resistance too?
---
Blackbird Power Armor paint.  That's it.
---
Don't really want camp stuff.
---
I'd love to see some cool Brotherhood or Enclave Military Outfits.  I'd spend atoms on that.
---
Again it seems we all are forgetting the big picture. We didn't ask for F4 in VR or this game, but we got it... and as said it was known it was going to be FAULTY... if you did any Google on the topic. Yes it could have been done right, well that can be said about just about anything. But as staticchmbr is really saying: you are in the end responsible for how things go. I can't or nor do I care to change minds about it, it's fact, or at least logic because it IS what we have or  we wouldn't have to be here now. You can blame the dev's, they just work there, they have bosses it's a job for them, it's the suits at the top that said "Rush another game out because we know we can.." and "Let's get everything out of this we can as fast as we can, while we can." With that I mean they saw the cash train of F'night and I say BDO (the Atom store) and told the DEV's we need a love child game and POOF... F76 was born... I want F5 but until then I hope this gets better, and no I don't think or care if they add living NPC(still don't get how that matters lol I've done about 85-95% of quest and what is not broken and not doable I thought was fine) But do want more content, workshops as a whole need a total redo - I'd say my them so you need to link them together(a powerstation, food, scrap, etc) like in F4 to make a trade route that would be the PVP, so you only do instanted atk on the WS but the have to answer the call of the convo= open world PVP. Just my rant and half cent. Sorry if its a grammar or spelling nightmare to long for me to edit.  
---
The rail car west of Watoga Station used to spawn them all the time. On the crate beside the corpse. Careful of the Assultron. ;)
---
They are armor penetrating ammunition.
---
If you're level 30 and it takes 4 hits to kill a level 5 Super Mutant, the problem is you and not Fallout 76.
---
The way that that works is that the mutations and diseases and such affect your SPECIAL total, but it doesn’t affect perk points. For example, egg head changing you from 15 to 12 wouldn’t prevent you from equipping 15 perk cards, but it would reducing your strength stat, therefore reducing melee damage 
---
Yeah like hey Bethesda, its a great shooter game.  Can you add some more content, events, and allow us to opt out of PvP damage.  Bethesda: Ok we added more PvP and nerfed it to a melee game, and here are some new bugs.
---
I think if I had to code it myself (which thankfully I dont) I'd probably put something in place that was....combat triggered essentially.  keep a counter on said enemy that is reset whenever that enemy would trigger a "heal" event...those are in there somewhere I'm sure.  Count the amount of damage blocked.  Define some value somewhere that basically says 
---
    DR% = Max(initialDR - ((TotalDamageBlocked/MaxDamageBlockable) * 100), 0);
---
That way you have a DR that starts Very High but the more damage it prevents, the less damage it WILL prevent on the next hit, until its basically tissue paper.  The issue being, you HAVE to keep track, for every enemy at all times, how much damage their armor has blocked, as well as defining both initialDR (already exists, current enemy DR), and MaxDamageBlockable (possibly based on current DR, but not sure how to calculate it).
---
The effect of this would be that for longer fights with bigger enemies, they well eventually lose ALL their DR, simply due to the amount of HP they have.  Even if you make their max damage blockable something ridiculously large (far above their HP Pool), a long enough fight with enough spitball weapons will still eat them alive by the end of the fight.
---
The only wrinkle is with legendaries...should their armor reset when they "mutate" and heal?  I say no, but given my previous definition it would.  Hard to decide on that one....
---
Ty, I'll take a look there too
---
If you're looking for farming spots, I just Google the following phrases.
---
Fallout 76 X location
---
Fallout 76 X farming
---
Substitute X with whatever you're looking for.
---
At least I didn't have to pay 200 dollars only to be disappointed with it.   
---
Someone had to say it. 
---
Can confirm, after getting tank killer max, killing enemies is so much easier. The ressistances are too high up especially queens and scorchbeasts
---
I think they need to increase the amount of stimpacks and radaway
---
Bethesda: that'll be 500 atoms, please
---
If the gauntlet is already established as a formidable weapon in lore, then it could directly follow that someone would eventually strap it to some power armor. Raider armor would match the aesthetic best I think, so it could be locked to that type of power armor. It would have been cool to have set bonuses like the excavator PA carry weight.
---
It really just depends on whether or not the Atom Shop is generating any appreciable revenue.
---
Switch to Verizon.
---
Don't be a victim of shitty customer service. Let your feet do the talking.
---
This is it. I’m level 44 right now and hit a wall where everything in the bog is just drinking my ammo. Realized I had almost 900 rounds for the pipe pistol. Crafted a level 40, modded it up, and I’m exploring lower level areas/events again to up my inventory levels, and I’m having no problem downing level 15 super mutants with a few shots. When I run up against something more level appropriate, I pull out a go-to weapon. 
---
Hopefully it gets fixed up, so what perks are SUPPOSED to work on th gauss rifle? Rifle and energy etc?
---
Man I hope they bring that blackbird paint back
---
Sitting on 4800ish caps have haven't bought anything yet, but I wish I would have gotten the Blackbird paint.  
---
I came across a horde of diseased protections in the club house not long after a nuke lol
---
thx
---
    Disconnected from server.
---
The junk yard between Vault 76 and Morgantown is a work shop that has a Titanium deposit. Put a refiner on that and you will have a good amount of Black Titanium.
---
Thought I would try it out today. So far, as expected, nothing. Very likely just a load of bullshit since no one else has found it and they refused to provide any type of proof or additional information about the location.
---
PS4 also, I'd like to see what ya got 
---
Because who buys physical games in any quantity, especially when on PC it has its own launcher that you have to use anyway?  They probably just over-ordered.
---
With any luck, it will get better. By luck, with the makers of the game at least, that means, they have to hit some crazy profit margin, than the game will for the most part get at least 80% better lol
---
Nope, I actually do that and it works everytime.
---
Racecar bed, black pipboy skin, dark laminate floors, fruit hat, hot rod paint, a few camera poses and the vault tec canopy
---
i wish i got the santa emote so ppl know im trying to give things to them
---
Wait, so you're saying Rifleman's armor reduction in 4 doesnt even work on energy weapons?
---
oh that's very strange then.
---
Well....they wouldn't be wrong about why everyone was specializing in boulder tossing.
---
But that proposed fix....yea, I could see them doing that....
---
Wow, would be freaky being up close and personal what that's operating
---
Prior to nerf files were good and not having a perk for them was intended to be drawback.  They are garbage, now, but it made since at the time.
---
It does suck. FWIW, Contractor perk helps defray costs. However, I'm not supporting this idea until the area Whitesprings becomes a no-camp zone. Turrets never, C.A.M.P.s forever.
---
&gt; They don’t get a chance, like you said, to play the game by design or as intended. That’s not their job function.
---
That's not been my experience and I have been a game designer for 20 years.
---
&gt; They see what could be wrong with “Level” 2, Section 4. They don’t know little Johnny can scrap his Power Armor by accident.
---
I guess I worked with better QA than you did because I would absolutely expect to get that kind of feedback. 
---
I use Excavator PA, and have maxed Lone Wanderer and Rad Resistant perks; I hardly take any damage from a SB.  I use a Handmade to take pop shots at it while it’s flying. But I dish out the real damage once it lands.  As mentioned in another comment, you’ll want to have a good melee weapon or shotgun for the close combat.
---
i kind of like the nuka cola stash box
---
Thing is, when people join, the SBQ does get more difficult, which is supposed to be remedied by damage they add to the fight. So when someone joins and doesn’t attempt to kill the SBQ or her summons, it only adds more difficulty.
---
They do nothing and get the same loot as the person who did the majority of the work.
---
Sentinels assassins total of 23% per armor piece so over 100% protection so no damage cavaliers has nothing to do with it
---
It is soooo grindy. Today, I spent hours grinding workshops hoping for plans (which are now insanely expensive).
---
Isn't it true explosive pretty much ignores all target DR (damage resistance), so it will never benefit any more from AA.  What it doesn't ignore is any target's damage reduction, which AA doesn't touch either.
---
Radsad 
---
no, it's unequipped automatically.
---
OK, so how about human NPC and faction control over map locations :)? 
---
I thought about it but I think I want the fire place more. 
---
On a sort of related note, saw this guys base the other day and was sort of mesmerized by it lol. I have only one second of video https://vimeo.com/315299788  
---
Dark souls lol
---
You shouldn't because you are not doing the damage as the other are. Why the f#ck should someone who does 1k damage be rewarded same good as the players who do 15k damage. I am spending my money and resources on crafting prime bullets and then you come with your pipepistol get same reward as I am. That is exactly why people are hiding in shed, because communism f#cking sucks. You want reward, you should earn it and not leech if off from others. Yeah, if you are level 30 and can do same damage as others, why not, but if you can't gtfo. 
---
That's my understanding. AA is a good modifiers for ballistic weapon damage. That is all. Never tested it in energy resistance but the way energy weapons are right now it doesn't quite matter.
---
I think the difficulty ramps up higher than what is proportional to what the lower level players can do in damage. So even if they unloaded all of their ammo it probably wouldn't amount to much.
---
That's why it needs to be fixed, wo that their presence has a negligible impact on difficulty. 
---
I love finding banjos.  That and teddy bears.  I wish i didn't accidentally break all mine down. 
---
thanks, I'll have to try again next time I find one, so far I've had 2 quad crossbows, sold both.
---
is that the same for other weapons, you have to reload extra to get the "full" magazine?
---
Yeah this, people are dicks, destroyed my base 3 times for no reason. No near WhiteSprings, one is at Morgantown and the other at huntingville on the west side of the map .. people are bored and morons.
---
Would love an option when I login whether I want to place my camp or not, so if I am not planning on using my camp, it won't get placed.
---
ive only spent the atoms earned in the game
---
Not everyone who pops into this games comes from the same gaming background you likely do. Keep in mind that some people don't know the mechanics and how to optimize as intuitively. Be kind. 
---
Does the weight of the gear actually matter for sneaking? So for instance would the lighter armor perks make your combat/metal gear easier to sneak in?
---
Hope so..would love to group up with my sons also would love not having to search for the disk.
---
I paid 750 caps for each shock and 1000 caps for a jetpack.
---
Fun? what is that
---
Me too, been playing since the beta and I do the daily/weekly challenges as often as bugs permit. 
---
Why the hell am I being downvoted for saying thank you? Fuck yall
---
I hope Spike looked a little more healthy than here. 
---
If you see another person's camp being attacked by other players or random computer baddies be careful. If you go to kill of the bad guys and accidentally hit the person's camp you get a wanted bounty. I found this out the hard way, lol.
---
Can we get some sort of indication of which power armor we have in our inventory or stash?
---
I can't seem to get anything other than the first 2 power armor i recived have out of the stash, even though i have like 6 diffrent frames all with diffrent gear on them.
---
Pre-nerf you could shoot it down over time, but now you are better off running away, leaving server, or having Dense/Fireproof and waiting for it to land.  Trying to shoot it down will just break your guns.
---
Get in game radio so this person can broadcast in the wastelands!! 
---
yeah i bought one more thing but cant remember
---
If you don't use sell it, if you not building, only collect the stuff you need to repair your weapons, armour and PA, I can't stop myself collecting, but I do toss bones, cloth or build from time to time to reduce it .. I also do collect less except the valuable stuff like springs, gears, screws etc .. I should toss more but I am managing ..really hoping Beth gets their shit together and gives us more stash, it's unacceptable, but hey we have come to expect nothing from them.
---
I'm starting to truly doubt if you're even in middle school "I'm making fun because you're stupid" stay classy reddit
---
Yeah I don't remember what happened. He Pug of some kind, then there was this bright flash of light and then, bam, Super Spike
---
You can skip that and go directly to the glassed caverns.
---
&gt;!If you are a stealth character, you can pretty much stealth all the way though the caverns.   At the end, run past the live scorchbeast to the other tunnel, stealth and wait for it to go back to non-aggressive.  Stealth over to the objective, grab the item and leave.!&lt;
---
Why do you care? So what if they get more for less. As they level up they will be able to contribute more. The cost for them to contribute at their level is massive compared to a high level character.
---
Their presence does have an adverse affect on you right now, but if that was remedied then it wouldn't matter if they joined or not. 
---
Yeah, I got pissed when I broke my banjo down
---
I have two industrial purifiers and once they hit 5 waters in their inventory, they don't produce more until I physically remove them. It's another way Bethesda keeps resources limited.
---
I've noticed that as well. 
---
I gave up on Fallout 76 and started ESO a few weeks ago. Really happy with it, just one bittersweet issue: the high quality of ESO really makes me upset with what an online Bethesda game COULD be, compared to what FO76 actually IS. The differences are night and day. In ESO the grind feels so rewarding it doesn't even feel like a grind, it just feels like "the next thing I want to do today." 
---
Everything scales appropriately. Items and upgrades everywhere and tons of of ways to play PVE or PVP. There are dozens of skills, features, quest lines, and items to explore. Crafting things feels like a reward that you run TOWARDS, not an endless desperate sprint to stay AWAY from the constantly and tediously encroaching threat of death/broken equipment. 
---
So....want to run some dungeons sometime?  I'm on PC NA. 
---
I LOVE THIS. 
---
Yes I am assuming they did change things just like you assume they did not. I am still waiting for some sort of proof they work exactly the same. Testing, ripping the stats from game files, anything. People say this info exists, but they never show it. You say xedit shows proof. So...
---
Do you have raider underarmor? Cause it is an upgrade not a craftable piece by its own. 
---
Yes my friend I am with you
---
it just works
---
It's like Bethesda designers have never played a video game before.
---
When you buy the skins from the atom shop, does it change the light/display colour? 
---
Black PA and camp stuff mostly. 
---
Yep. Without that Fallout 76 will feel like OGame. "I need to login once a day to keep up with the vendor resets". 
---
Does the build budget get higher as you level up?
---
The raider icon
---
I don't see , since they are just vaults, how it can be anything other than just a silo like area. Doubt that they even have rooms that branch off into other cells. Sadly.
---
I had my camp destroyed once when I wasn't paying attention to the map, came home and everything was just blown the fuck up and there was a wanted level 90+ trying to kill me when I got back, as a level 30 I had no chance of fighting back and had to just server hop and rebuild, ever since then I've been extremely paranoid, checking the map every 5 seconds to see if anyone is near it haha
---
I started a melee/power armor alt and took out a mob of lvl 40-60 super mutants at Safe 'n' Clean while less than lvl 20 with a power armor frame, four pieces of lvl 15 raider armor and a spiked lvl 15 fire axe.  It wasn't easy, but that same lvl 68 boss mutant would have sucked up 3-4 headshots with my main character's lvl 50 TSE bolt action pipe sniper rifle.  I might have had to hit it 18 times with a lvl 15 spiked fire axe.  No tactics involved, just smash, kite and use a stimpak here and there.  I didn't have access to Power Patcher perk, but I looked at my armor afterwards and it was barely dented from a mob of top level enemies.  My sniper would have died for sure at the same level, and it would have been an easy burn of a couple dozen rounds through a TSE pipe bolt action even at lvl 150+.  I just hit lvl 26 today and my plain spiked fire axe does more damage than my main's lvl 45 2-shot Handmade CQC rifle.  Yes, I can't pop off rounds, but even with that ability a mob of ghouls is very dangerous for my sniper when I inevitably hit \[danger\] and just plink their health with an end-game rifle.  
---
As a power armor melee, I also take minimal damage in an incomplete suit of the lowest level 15 raider power armor, hardly use any ammo with an axe, a backup lvl 20 sledge and a lvl 25 .44 pistol for enemies up on ledges.  Taking out lvl 22-40 mole miners in the Ash Heap is very easy at lvl 25.  The lvl 40 glowing miners are barely challenging.  I remember being very careful around them as a sniper at probably lvl 40+, especially inside a mine or building interior where I had limited room and escape routes to maneuver into new positions.
---
That's wisdom.
---
Black pip-boy paint, duster, cowboy hat.
---
I wouldn't even mind, because at least I could sell all I need to sell in a day. 
---
Nah. 400 wasn't enough, now 600 isn't enough, if it had been 1000 at launch that wouldn't have been enough. People who are going to find ways to cheat the system, any system. And the people who are throwing tantrums now because they can't stash 25,000 lbs of extraneous gear on a mule character were never going to be mollified by a larger stash size. 
---
I think the correct perks apply (rifleman, batteries included, tank killer etc). It's just the Class freak *seems* broken to me, but I couldn't narrow it down totally
---
It is in the modify menu. You must have Road Leathers, Harness, Long Johns, or Raider Leathers in your inventory. You can also find plans to craft these, or you can buy them at most Raider Vendor Bots.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/) is a post detailing what under armor and linings there are.
---
Or even less if you can use discord
---
That is so freegin cool!
---
Bethesda is unfortunately in line with Blizzard attempting to go "full EA"
---
Games are all we got y'know? Faith in humanity died years ago, don't fuck us on this too Bethesda. You're so much better than this.
---
Dropped your /s
---
Playing Fallout 76 is like having a Tamagotchi with a tapeworm.
---
Normally they would as every CAMP piece you damage raises your level 10caps
---
&gt; Zero-value junk can be sold by bulking it first
---
True, but some bulked gear isn't worth much of anything.  I like bulking copper, aluminum, and gears myself.  Anything with about 80 value per bulk.  I usually just craft or pitch anything lesser.  And anything with 6-10 cap value unbulked I just sell outright (unless needed).
---
Grinding.  I do whitesprings probably 4-5 runs per day I play.   Ive probably dropped and sold hundreds of ledgendaries.  Plus knowing where the 3 star enemies spawn helps.   Or focus on caps and trade for a good weapon.   
---
Yes there is, for the 99% who don't dupe. 
---
Not that I'm aware of, I bought the black skin so the change may not be as obvious compared to one of the more colourful skins.
---
if you mean me, thanks for the support!
---
Maybe the devs will pay attention ive send all the community managers a PM about it aswell.
---
I loved the 1-34ish experience and actively sought to go into areas with higher challenge where me killing enemies was gonna Be a big accomplishment. I’ve done it twice now with opposite styles, one mobility, melee, sneak marsupial and one long range power armor tech / explosives user. I can understand most players don’t want an extreme challenge, but that is one of the key pieces of this game that made it feel really classic to me. A fresh go vs the often boring gameplay of other recent games (recent updates to games that used to feel more classic) where it’s just meaningless face rolling without having to strategize or pick battles.
---
What I don’t agree with is the way they are changing things in the name of balance without fixing the core responsiveness of action Bar system (the system we are using to harness our equipment and inventory against hostiles ), it needs to be fully customizable and fully responsive. How can you have balance without basic playability of the tools used to win in combat ? How can you know what balance means if I can’t even throw the damn grenades you just also weakened by changing the perk card? The skill curve has too much to do with unfinished systems. 
---
Next is perks. Upgrading needs to just give the higher level of the card. Duplication is a waste of the user’s time both during the card selection and after when there are duplicates from card packs. The option to store any card we don’t want to use in the build needs to be added. Owning each level of the card I chose along the way should be a given, not a result of me spending more card picks to own the lower levels over again. 
---
If they can’t bother to finish the game then ui modding and a creation club system for rules/mode/sky is the limit content creation need to be rolled out higher priority than garbage balance pretenses and a garbage survival mode that will be even less playable. We will help make it a finished game and ensure the community will continue to grow and be able to enjoy this game the way a fallout game should be.
---
I am angrily saying this from a place of utmost love as a huge fan of the game that’s spent a few hundred hours in it on both pc and Xbox, and spends about half and Half playing as interacting with Reddit, streamers, and podcasters / fellow idea people that love the game as well. 
---
Thats because everyone is bitching about transfers. You know, all the casual gamers that dont know how to play an mmo. Yea those guys. 
---
Honestly the beginning levels before about 40 or 45 are terribly difficult. The best thing I did was invest in the luck perks to randomly repair weapons and armor. Also, setting up your CAMP on a lead deposit can be a life saver. Steel and gunpowder are easy enough to come by. 
---
The enemy spawns are hard to deal with. Walking into an area where someone else has been and running into enemies 20 or 30 levels higher than you kills the fun of the game. For example, getting the sword from the Whitesprings rooms with level 70 charred ghouls spawning sucks. Enemy difficulty helped shape the direction of the story in previous games but 76 has lost that.
---
That's a hard one to solo - I did it yesterday with at least 2-3 others and it wasn't down to the wire.
---
Only PVP in Adventure should be in taking over/defending workshops.
---
So did I
---
Sounds great to me!
---
From a logical viewpoint some of the data miners would have said something like hey! Look at all this alien shit. But alas no aliens. There was a video of a ufo flying around fissure prime after a nuke drop but Noone has been able to recreate it or get any proof. 
---
Jerry can turn a single shot .22 bolt action into a TSE lol.
---
Yep. See that's not good. Needs to be changed. 
---
 I bought the red one months ago and no.
---
It’s different depending on the reload.
---
For instance, you watch your guy put 24 bullets into a single action revolver/pump shotgun(1 button push)
---
Most guns have the exact same reload with quad(.44, Western, handmade, double barrel ect..)
---
And now we learn crossbows put 4 bolts in the mag(4 button pushes)
---
I don’t get this game. I don’t play, I follow it somewhat as it sounds interesting with the duping and cheating and glitches. But honestly it sounds like the duper’s were right, they are the only ones able to play the actual game without it being nothing but constant grinding.
---
I understand using these cheats in a multiplayer game is fucked up, but I can’t even count how many posts complaining about this game is non stop grinding so that you can actually “play the game” for 30 minutes or so.
---
Honestly I would recommend you jump ship and return maybe once (if) they turn things around. I had all the same complaints and still do, I don’t have a ton of time to game so I’m not trying to grind 70% of the time I’m playing, collect trash the other 20%, and enjoy the last 10%. 
---
I have always loved Fallout since I first picked up 3 but this is honestly one of the worst games (maybe THE worst triple A title) I’ve ever played, all things considered.
---
New content
---
Bethesda: Hey we made this multiplayer Fallout survival game.  
---
Reddit: Hey thats real nice but can you make it single player and take away the survival from it
---
Yeah, I've never really seem any builds with more than 4 or 5. Which you could easily have by, well, level 4 or 5. 
---
Regardless, my point stands. A level 179 character does not *necessarily* have any more hit points than a level 20.
---
yeah u need the armor first
---
Someone actually put two purifiers in my CAMP last week. So far they have water every time I go back to CAMP.
---
Yes 
---
Can't wait 
---
Not sure if (this) [https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/#ampf=undefined] is what you're looking for but it seems kinda handy regardless...
---
I'm just pointing a out an observation. People like you are the reason its dying. We can't post without your approval. Sorry oh great jabba for post without submitting the proper forms.
---
I have no idea how people find these glitches and uses them to cheat the game. It’s so annoying when people cheat. Especially for an online server. It takes the fun away 
---
Yeah I noticed the only perk they get for armor penetration requires the user to use power armor. I assume there is no weapon mods for armor penetration for heavy weapons in this game?
---
Where can I find this tape?
---
Paddle faster! I hear banjos!
---
Lol, why is everyone here upset. It doesn't matter what your build is, if you put time in it and research all the pros and cons you can become good. Yes certain builds like melee are easy, or low hp builds, but that doesn't mean no other build is viable. Right now i'm a heavy weapons build and i have yet to meet someone that kills me easily.
---
I simply never realized how much I would miss interactive, branching dialogues with NPCs, until I played a game that didn't have them. I guess I thought 76 would be more cooperative play, but unless I jump into the game with an IRL friend, I can play an entire session without even seeing another player. 
---
It doesn't really matter though. Out of my biggest frustrations with this game, the lack of interactive branching dialogue NPCs doesn't usually merit a complaint from me. At this point I'm just trying to get the Level 100 achievement before they nerf melee and then I may try Anthem. 
---
Any value to a full teddy set? I tried collecting once or twice lol.
---
Sigh 
---
I would be suspect of a 750ti being able to handle this game, 100% gpu is normal. My brother has the same gpu and didn't buy because of it, it seemed to fall a bit short minimum recommended requirements.
---
I just learned this about the chainsaw, the drill, and the mr Handy buzzblade. Repair to 200 percent and they WRECK but the monent they go below 200 percent they do not wreck. 
---
As someone with a Bloodied Explosive 10mm SMG build, I care. 
---
I care a lot. 
---
No, you don't nerf melee. You buff ranged. Don't make it worse.
---
I'm so disgusted...
---
...but hey, at least my shotgunner build can now carry more bobby pins without being over encumbered! Before the Patch 5 hot-fix, I was working on a bobby pin build, but now that's nerfed. :) If only I would take time to swap-in my lockpick perk cards...naw, the loot is usually not worth the effort.
---
All joking aside, when I think of Fallout, I think energy and heavy weapons, NOT melee. I guess Fallout and Elder Scrolls ARE in the same universe. I love Fallout and have high-hopes for this game; please Bethesda, don't let this be the meta. 
---
It's funny you think they care.
---
I do wish they had a better way to flag plans as "Mods" vs "Base Items".  Currently you just have to know or deduce based on the name or cost of the plan.
---
They probably found out that a super sledge hammer..er weighed less.
---
Harder and tedious which is a giant no. Ypu don’t do that
---
\[Already on it\]([https://imgur.com/l5yyG0t](https://imgur.com/l5yyG0t)).
---
You skilled bastard... You can draw a deathclaw but not me lol i love the art
---
this.   there is no sense in wasting ammo and weapon durability on them.  great game design by BGS.
---
Fruit hat, Pirate hat- and am very happy with both. I would really like to see some Raider inspired outfits and camp items. 
---
I’m a noob. What’s this mean lol? 
---
It is a survival game, just saying. Curious what other survival games aren't a resource management simulator. 
---
This is pretty much when learning to play comes into effect - instead of complaining about things they don't even understand, they should take an interest and learn.  By far this game is easily one of the easiest and most casual games to get into.
---
3 6 and 7 are the biggest issues for me, and then of course not being able to remove a staircase that is touching nothing but a foundation. That’s a bad bug they should fix quickly. The whole idea that a piece can’t be removed cuz it’s “floating” is stupid since entire bases are being supported by a single staircase everywhere I look. 
---
Vampire Outfit
---
Santa Bundle
---
Vault Tec Pijamas
---
Sugar Bombs Pip-Boy skin
---
Vault Boy Santa Icon
---
Right now im at 710 out of 800 Atoms for the Silver Shroud Outfit
---
Indeed, but ES is Beth's product, and they gave the online version for someone else to do.
---
Don't forget, they also increased the wait time between a specific event spawning, so if you really liked a particular event, you have to wait *longer* for it to start again.
---
Are you using the Western .44? 
---
And collectibles are pointless because they are consumed objects (whether junk or Buffs, fancier chems). The perk system needs to get fixed so the collectibles are actually collected and run on cooldown. I hadn’t even played diablo 3 when I had this idea. The perk card system already inspired me. 
---
The junk and items that have Physical in the world models need to be able to be built. there are so many cool ways containers and organizational objects could be implemented for both usable gear and decorating. 
---
I've enjoyed it too.
---
I don't see this going out on an official tweet! Or [my character](https://imgur.com/l5yyG0t) for that matter.
---
Only in one direction!
---
Yeah while I try to figure out what is the next game I am going to play I just put up with this shit. Like last night we had the whole server at Uranium Fever. I kid you not it took 5 minutes for loot to load. 
---
Then half of us went to the Clubhouse and that was a mistake, took literally 10 minutes for loot to load. Seriously adventuring and just looking for cool locations I haven't seen yet is currently end game content. You can't really do events. 
---
My friend and I were building bases at the same time and kept getting message 'server controls disabled' or whatever.  Only one person at a time can build a base, and you shouldn't have more than 3 people at an event... seriously? WTF
---
Candy cane skin for my primary weapon, a walking cane.
---
Paint job for my pip-boy (sugar bombs, I think, to match my Camden Park uniform).
---
A social icon of an old man.
---
Altogether I think I spent either 1260 or 1460, can't remember, with over 3k left over from regular gameplay.
---
My belief is that the items on sale for a day are still there afterwards, just at a higher price.  If I’m wrong, then yup that would suck.  I did farm atoms and got that linoleum for 400.  Wasn’t easy.  
---
If you're just starting (under Lvl 5) you can go to  The Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center by Flatwoods and there is a room with just about every plant growing in there. If you go at a low level the robots won't shoot you, you can just walk right in, can't remember if it Lvl 5 or 6 when you become open game.
---
Fallout 1 always did
---
Once you move your camp what you built is gone huh? Like you have to remake it again with the stored materials?
---
If you buy a game new you know it’s going to devalue. It’s like buying a new car. You pay extra for getting it right away, and always risk the price going down.
---
You know, nobody told any of you guys this...but this isn't just another Fallout game, it's an MMO by Bethesda design. Have you ever played Elder Scrolls Online? Yeah, Fallout 76 isn't grindy by that standard. Not even close.
---
Collectables are honestly one of the stupid things in previous fallouts that are actually kind of fun. It's really a bummer they haven't figured out how to do that in 76. But I guess "It's a survival game..."
---
So why does there have to be a drawback or consequence? How does that make good game play in this situation?
---
 Does it protect game economy from having crafters and fighters switch back and forth (which we currently have most people being able to do both)? What is the goal of this addition and why do we need to have a consequence?
---
Reactive plates reflect melee damage back so when they one shot the person they’re gonna die too 
---
 Aaargh! so frustrating! for the second time weapons are disappearing from my inventory when repairing it. I had a 3 star legendary Death tambo which disappeared a few weeks ago after repairing. Today I repaired my All Rise(pretty crucial item when you are a melee player) and it just disappeared. Maybe it's related to the weapon artisan perk that I have equipped. 
---
This is correct.  You need the proper type of under-armor to see it as a craftable mod.  
---
Road Leathers, Harness, Long Johns, or Raider Leathers
---
You can find those items in the world, or get the plans from vendors or events.
---
I’ve got some ballistic fiber you can have. You on xbox?
---
I agree about it being harder. I did the monster mash after the patch and got destroyed by ghouls that came in nonstop waves. 
---
And then a yo gui killed me in 3 hits!!
---
It was half my lvl!!
---
First thing I bought was the clean generator.
---
Absolute waste of fucking free currency. Place it in a building, and it’s nice and clean. No black smoke, great. Just what it says on the tin.
---
Go outside of the building, and thick black smoke is billowing from the place the generator is. Same if you place the generator on a higher floor, then go downstairs, smoke pours through the ceiling in the spot the generator is placed. So glad I didn’t actually spend real $$$ on it.
---
Some of the other stuff is cool. The glowing map looks ace. 
---
It's probably not in the game because they couldn't figure out how to put text chat in for consoles and didn't want to have a separate play experience for PC users.
---
Not sure if [this](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png) is what you're talking about but it might help...
---
This happens to me idk why 
---
Are reflective plates for only certain PA
---
You'll still die. 45% for serendipity to activate, and I walk away.
---
Well...it is West Virginia lol
---
What is your recording set up if you don't mind me asking? I'm trying to record demos to put out for voice acting and your recording sounds GREAT
---
It's funny though, as everyone is moving from range to melee, I'm moving more towards range. I mean that is if I play.
---
1000 times this.
---
They were at Grafton Station as a random plan the vendor sold.
---
Looks like they accidentally left it out of the vendor when they went to "all plans".
---
Seen this post a lot.  
---
Yea you should stay in the forest until about lvl 25 at around there you should go to the top of the world and do Rose's quests
---
That sounds like poor game design if they ramp up the SBQ so much based on just the number of players and you have a 10 or so from lvl10 to lvl30 just sitting around. I'm at around 60+ and do what I can to help out when I can, sure hope your not saying that only 100+ lvl characters should be down there.
---
Certain things are discounted certain things are in fact one day only 
---
The Enclave gave a super mutant power armor and we got Frank Horrigan our finest agent. So who is to say the same can't be done for a mind controlled Deathclaw? Way to make a scary enemy even scarier I love it. Who would win? Cazaclaw or Power Armor Claw? 
---
Assuming you arent camping in whitesprings with a butt ton of turrents freezing up the session then you should be able to get something back. I have been tempted to death bomb camps in whitesprings. Between freezing and stolen kills makes me go bonkers. And I'm honestly a pleasant traveling merchant.
---
I have mine across from the top of the world. No turrents just benches for passerbys
---
With proof... you’re asking for a lot lol
---
*Clap clap clap* Want a sticker for all the hard work? Nah, you just wanted to come across as a know-it-all smartass? Well.. I guess mission accomplished. 
---
addblock pluss...
---
Played every day since launch.  But since the latest update it's just not fun like it was.  Not really sure what it is.  The game is cool but grinding just to repair so I can actually play is just not my cup of tea.  Then most of my friends list have left since patch and that adds to the not wanting to play.  While I'm happy for those that like the changes, for me they just missed the mark to get me to play as much.
---
yep, happened once to me. then another time it was protectron bots. I wish the golf club had bots more often, need the lead and aluminum some times.
---
Yes.... dont tell me, its the wrong .44 :-(
---
Will you be on tonight around 6pm CST? Also, how many caps are we talking? 
---
Gosh, it's almost like they based an entire game on the complaints they recieved about F04. /s
---
It's not necessary. I guess what I mean by that is someone who actually owns the outfits to tell me how they got them
---
Stop playing it. Not that they've really earned a 76th chance at this point, but they can either lose their entire player base, or improve the game. They've now proven, over and over, that either:
---
* They don't have the resources to sufficiently improve the game (aka they're literally incapable of fixing the bugs or evaluating design choices before making them)
---
* They don't care what needs to actually happen, and they just want to do whatever the hell they want to, for whatever reason, including none at all.
---
Beyond that, it doesn't even matter if they're intentionally being malicious or greedy or not, because objectively, this game cannot last if they don't make a MAJOR change to their approach.
---
If you're playing a friendly game of sports with someone, and they hit you with the ball, maybe it was an accident. If they hit you with the ball *every single time you play*, you can now be certain they are not going to do anything but hit you with the ball. You stop playing with them, and go find someone else to play with. Maybe if they wanna make it up to you, they'll go out of their way to do so.
---
I was lucky enough to have gotten my money's worth early, before the majority of the even-worse-and-more-tedious changes, and now I call it a draw and am moving on to some other game. If, 3 months from now, I read a news article that explains how "Fallout 76 is now actually worth playing and is super fun and worth it!", I might hop back in. Hell, I might even purchase a $20 skin that only applies to a single armor piece and no longer displays if that armor piece gets modded, if I'm feeling particularly generous and the game's somehow amazing at that point. Otherwise? I'm currently putting my chips into Anthem. Who knows if it'll be amazing or not... only time will tell. But I'm certainly not going to waste my finite life on Fallout76 while the game gets constantly unimproved, and my advice is that neither should any of you.
---
The community did its part. Your further efforts are wasted until Bethesda responds in kind with effort of their own.
---
I don’t know what everyone’s complaining about.  This game made me reinstall Skyrim with new perk mods and I couldn’t be happier! 
---
Was afraid of that ...
---
I just got off but we could meet up later on. Two shot Hausa rifle pending sale. 
---
Honestly, those are all pretty good ideas. I'd check out the tremor stabalizers.
---
Hell maybe even some type of paint that would reflect some of the Sonic blast back at her.
---
Unfortunately, yes. It’s only the normal version. Why? Who knows but it is 
---
 the npcs give life to any game! fallout 76 is an empty container If you only had npcs and populated areas, it would be much better 
---
I always loved displaying stuff in FA4. You could create a "showroom" to show off your collection.
---
They should make each point of armor a percentage reduction fixed: an example would be 100 armor means 15% damage reduction, 200 30% and so on. It doesn't depend on how much damage is taken, but only on the armor. Working to player and enemies in the same way. Otherwise just remove enemy armor and increase their health. There aren't any other working around. Of course this would need about 1 week of reworking, something that the devs/editors seem to not consider as an option. 
---
There should be a receiver option for all full auto guns and pistols that is armour piercing removing 90% of a targets dr I think new Vegas did damage resistance very well making my 5mm machine gun a great weapon against all enemies 
---
Should be lower change, like 0.5% chance, but other than that I agree.
---
Overstuffed Vault-Tec chair and the Silver Shroud costume.
---
Its not a laser weapon.  He's good for a full Whitesprings run with 2-3 ranks of gunsmith.
---
I will be on later. We are talking best offer. I'm broke but reasonable lol. Two shot gauss may be sold. Pending
---
I had made my camp next to Morgantown airport so I could basically farm the scorched pipe weapons because all I had was a surplus of .38 ammo and would play for maybe 10-15 min then get disconnected. Every single time I ran through I would lure a mob of them toward that big semi and shoot all the oil on the ground around it and take out a large chunk of them in one foul swoop
---
Say it's harder say it's tedious say whatever you want but they're consistently reducing the amount of reward for the amount of hours you put in to the game and every time I see one of these trending I get kind of frustrated because these are the things I've been screaming since they won and getting downvoted for and my credibility slashed by a bunch of stupid nerds and crybabies on here like it's just a game I don't see how people get as but hurt by things we say on this sub and not butthurt by what a pain in the ass it is to play
---
I believe the chat mod uses a third-party server to work and I had read the description of an other mod that uses a third part server as well because they did have a way to save data locally.
---
ranged weapons should get damage buff from agility or perception like how melee get form strength.
---
I prefer plans being available so I'm fine with an increase in price, but totally agree they should increase the amount of caps that vendors have on hand to buy your stuff. 200 is not enough. And don't get me started on the reduced caps available after you buy something from said vendor (again, capped at 200 caps). 
---
My IRL friend (a rifle build) quit the game after the last round of gun nerfs. I'd just like to reach Level 100 before they nerf melee so now I'm playing the Kill, Loot, Sell game about 90 minutes a day. An hour of crafting and killing, then 30 minutes of vendor hopping to sell stuff. Just want to get to level 100 before they nerf melee and then I'll look to go to a different game. 
---
I really want to retire from this stupid economy. 
---
It’s not beyond repair but they are failing to hear the intelligent discourse on what should be done to finish it. 
---
I'm not saying that nobody would have. I'm just saying less people would have. You will never wipe it out permanently, but you can make it so people are less incentivized to. 
---
Didn't even know there were 2 varieties, how daft is that? How can I play fancy cowboys now?
---
Thank you. Pre or post patch?
---
I vote no. But I heard something, probably just nonsense rumor, but I heard about DLC where Raiders come because Rose called them with the radio. That sounded pretty awesome.
---
I found it too. I shot it once, damaging it for about 75%, it disappeared before I could shoot it a second time. Yea, disappeared, as in teleporting away. What a disappointment. Suits the game perfectly.
---
Doesn't help with armor since you can't favorite it, and it would limit you to 12 "locked" things.
---
I welcome more challenge. I sort of blew through the game at launch and was sitting at level 100 before I even knew what was going on, didn't use any exploits willfully or intentionally, but I am sure that I benefited from stuff like the bloated glowing ones giving too much XP and the fusion core reset thing. That really caused me to get the feeling that the game was just too easy and wasn't meant to be challenging in any way. I would definitely appreciate a little real challenge for the hardcore player in me.   
---
That being said, as has been stated, there is a distinct difference between good difficulty and bad difficulty. Tedium is generally not considered good difficultly in many cases. Encounters that really get my heart pumping are what I am looking for. The only time I felt that in the current game was the time I fast traveled and immediately got mobbed by a pack of about 8 Mirelurk Kings. Their decent HP and DR combined with their ranged attacks and DoT made them very difficult to fight in a pack like that. I want more of stuff like that, however, I feel like I received that challenge for all the wrong reasons. They just have a powerful DoT that, as far as I know, cannot be mitigated in any way, so a pack of them was just going to be challenging no matter what. I wasn't actually faced with a uniquely challenging encounter, I was just given a bullshit encounter that I happened to survive. Still, it did really get my head in the game, and that was really cool. 
---
I noticed that. However, sometimes that atom symbol disappears. I don't know why or how. It just does sometimes. Then I have to play the display game and pull everything out.
---
Post patch
---
So I was in WS fixing my armor and a guy came up to me and said he was going to kill me. I was like "Oh here we go " and he began beating on me. I had pacifist on and just took it. But got bored and started walking away. I went upstairs and hid in a closet crouching. He apparently aggroed the robots and logged out. I thought I was done with him.
---
He sees me on another server another day and comes to me immediately at my camp and attacks me and shoots up my entire camp. I just stand there getting a picture of him in case I need it. 
---
Another day I am on a different toon with my friends when this guy comes to my friend's camp and he's brought two friends. They proceed to attack me and my friends and so I get it on video and while I'm videoing it I am trying to block them. I didn't block the third griefer for some reason (logged before I blocked him) and now I am afraid that that third one is going to be hunting me down for his group. they seem to have a hard on for hunting me down for some reason.  Yay. Next time I will make sure to block all of them 
---
What is this 99% you speak of though? Lol because a very high percentage duped or used the caps exploit. Also the duper’s were ahead of the game by making mule accounts to spread out their duped items so Bethesda’s ban method isn’t even that effective.
---
You can doubt all you want since I'm in university.
---
Only 10 rounds? You got off lucky. I was farming sugar grove yesterday and got killed three fucking times by the Assaultron in the command center. Spent probably 8 grenades and roughly 100 rounds of .556. And the best part is that every time you respawn, it heals itself so you have to start over on it.
---
I amazed there isn’t more “hurr durr, but mah raider RP” people here...
---
For fun i think. I'm always firing off flares for shits and giggles
---
Found a high powered magnet for the first time. Also like you found a All star Basketball and then went up to my friend and dropped it in a bag in front of him and said "Hey now!" Hehe
---
Haven't had that happen just yet, thankfully.
---
Wouldn't the scorched disease explain why there's no ghouls just like how it did with people..?
---
It’s simple. All you have do to is forget how to read and develop tuberculosis. A cowboys real weapon is his lack of hygiene. 
---
Nothing as everyone else states. Maybe I'll return when they get their heads out of their asses and get new leadership that can properly balance a game and manage a decent endgame. 
---
And then we’ll see the articles from places like kotaku with the headline, “Fallout 76 was so bad that it’s being given away only months after release”
---
That does sound sweet
---
Good for England allowing the mentally challenged into Uni. Don't say anything offensive you may get arrested
---
Nope. First paragraph of the Rifleman perk page for the nukapedia wiki:  [click here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rifleman)
---
'**Rifleman** is a perk in Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. This perk affects both energy and ballistic weapons, but **only reduces a target's ballistic damage resistance,** **not energy or radiation resistance**.'
---
It increases energy damage but the entry point function in the perk is for enemy damage resistance, not enemy spell resistance (energy is a type of spell damage).
---
You could just have legendaries never go below 50% of their base armor, while normal enemies bottom out at 0 or 20%.
---
Meh. Most of those guys like most players mostly just do PVE.
---
You can't take weight seriously, you literally hide a Gatling laser and 10x more rifles up your butt. And yes even a 10lb rifle weighs you down irl, it's exhausting. I hunt deer real life if you need some credibility.
---
T60 - not just any power armor.  Steel, plastic, aluminium and you're good for repairs.  The others suck up a gazillion springs and other stuffs.
---
Honest question.  Can you get the spawns to follow you into the shed?  Make those people actually fight or die trying?  If all they are doing is hiding I think its more then fair. 
---
I'm lvl 35 and I haven't attempted to go fight a queen because I know I can't help much.  But if I were there I'd at least fight.  Die a lot but fight. Furthest east I've been is WS a couple times trying to complete the feral golfers thing (at 7/10 because usually I'm there and so are some lvl 80+ making higher levels spawn and I cant get mine.) but I keep hearing stories like this and I feel like you should either murder them all or bring the swarms to them.
---
I did know about the campfires to plant crops but agree it dosnt look that good, but great video and I have an idea for a new build!
---
1. Fast travel to Harper’s ferry 75% of the time leads to me restarting my PS4 due to the fact that after the loading screen, the HUD of my PA is showing, but everything else is pitch black. Fast travelling does not fix, quitting to main menu does not fix only a power cycle of the console fixes.
---
2. Can also confirm VATS is bugged.
---
3. Takes about 5 minutes after killing legendary ghouls at nuked white springs for the legendary loot to be... lootable. Can loot ammo / caps / junk, but have to run away and then come back in order for the good stuff to spawn.
---
Playing PC. and DCfS 4 times in the period of 4 hours.. Lost 3 workshops and Missed finishing 2 events..   
---
This is so frustrating to play :(
---
Nailed it about the scorchbeasts. Basically every time I think "Is this worth the time and ammo I'm going to spend actually killing this thing?" And every time the answer is "Nope."
---
Gauss. Autocorrect
---
How much damage does your chainsaw do?
---
I think it does. I don't want to disparage the mod or the author at all, but I wouldn't be surprised if having to use the secondary server caused some issues. Too bad, since I loved being able to chat. 
---
I mean that's kind of an unfair dig at Blizzard. While some of their expansions might be hit or miss, they've never released a game this bad or buggy.
---
Lol
---
Oh they we're definitely drugged out of there mind.
---
Same... I'm sure they'll show up eventually. They're probably sleeping in. 
---
Everyone's play style is different so I just want to get that out of the way. 
---
What I would do in your situation would first off, stop repairing your armor.  Its way cheaper to wear it till its brakes and craft a new piece to replace.  Secondly, if you don't want to take crafting perks to repair/maintain your weapons you need to up you luck stat so you get better quality equipment when you kill something.  Finally, I'd pick up the medic perks, makes a world of difference in this game if you're running solo.
---
Personally, I carry 2 guns (Combat Shotgun for up close, and Sniper Rifle for long Range neither are legendary), and a melee weapon in case I quest too long and my Shotgun breaks.  Aside from the last BOS and last Enclave mission, I've been able to solo the game with little difficulty.  I gave up on normal armor as soon as I finished the Excavator Armor mission, and haven't looked back.
---
Hope that helps.
---
I'd be down with this. At least get damage on par without screwing over melee builds - I'd hate for them to over compensate and make melee useless in PVP though - even though I don't pvp very often this would piss off a lot of people.
---
I have no idea what that mofo is packing but I want to rip it off and use it.  
---
Not a single aspect of the survival system was designed or built with any creativity and there is almost no synergy between building and survival which is usually a key aspect of any good survival experience.
---
It could be do-able in 2 ways. Rose calling in raiders with her radio. And more vaults opening up allowing more people to be in the area. I like both as dlc ideas
---
Wow, I knew about the revolver thing which is why I assumed the crossbow was just broken.  I imagine that if a BP quads been found, it was sold with my same bad assumption :( 
---
Not only that one, all vaults are datamined/glitched through showing rough outlines of what they're meant for. Spoilers ahead. Basically, no NPC's as everyone in the vaults died due to different causes. The one in the ash heap for example has multiple rooms with breaches of burning ash &amp; toxic air. Another one got taken over by mirelurks with a queen as the final boss. All signs of these vaults point to them being team events.
---
Diablo immortal. 
---
I'm just going to leave that there.
---
It’s a philosophical difference. “All guns should be powerful” is on the same spectrum as “all areas should be easy”, or “all decisions a player should make should be smart”. 
---
A game that protects the player from making bad decisions is called a *not survival game*.
---
&gt;this is not skyrim the ranged builds must be the meta!!!
---
Did you not play Skyrim, or have you never met our friend, Stealth Archer?
---
How many fusion cores would this PA need to function? :)
---
Yep. It would. As well, the Appalachian region was never actually hit with any bombs, so the early radiation was not as bad. 
---
You whine like a mule christian.
---
Or... people migrating west from the capital since DC is in such a bad state
---
The not so peaceful version scared the shit out of me on my first encounter. I was about lvl 20 then. 
---
I peed a little, I died, he could keep my scrap. 
---
Second encounter I had a big bad exploding .50 cal. 
---
We meet again, Mr Mothman. Now say hello to my little friend! 
---
that's not what that word means.
---
That could have been me, except that I stuck it out to the bitter end. An anticlimactic end to my first solo nuke...
---
That could be fixed if they intelligently implement shareware so we can bring new people in and have it be a social interaction. A different model then the launch model where we brand new players spent money to start out on Day 1. Diablo 1 had a share disc and had people play it with their friends to spread the game’s clout
---
I'm at Lvl 53 now but took out my first on at Lvl 45 and it was a PITA. Got my hands on a Lvl 35 .50cal with Ammosmith maxed out and you can rain some hate. Now its "I'd rather not, but if you insist on farting on me....I keeel you". 
---
Not actually true in the case of GTA Online.
---
Try running the Headhunter VIP Mission for instance. The bodyguards can survive 10+ headshots.
---
Same as some of the enemies in the Doomsday Heist.
---
For the most part, you are correct however.
---
It's almost like a lot of more and more companies out there are choosing to utilize their player base to beta test their patches to test for stability *before* releasing to the main game. It's like Bethesda has never heard of a test server.
---
**HI there, I hope you are well, I am done with your game at this point, so sad to say the least, use to love FO76, I can’t be doing this any more, your game is a complete mess unrepairable or at least it seems, before I move on though, I just wanted to review and give feedback on the new game patch 5/hotfix/ FO76**
---
**Issues and Ideas;** 
---
1. **All power armour damage is ridiculous, level 205, 600+ hrs in game time. I can't keep playing the game due to damage, being done from all creatures, in game, they seem to be killing me off way too easily, stimpacks no longer seem to work and serum for 300+ health is none existent  and I am going through approximately 30- 40 stimpacks per session with perc cards or within an hour of average gameplay, not fun at a price of $96 caps per stimpack, and lack of caps, and stimpacks in game anymore, and there is no in-game balance to that effect just running out of resources as if I was a level, 1 player? Not very cool to say the least!** 
---
2. **Wanted! I have had this happen 3 times now for no reason, never attacking or damaging another player, just randomly wanted, with a high price tag on my head, I get killed and it reappears serval times after I have been killed and killed and killed again, losing all my resources multiple times, not to mention hundreds of caps at a time, forcing me to stop playing!**
---
3. **Plans, Large Generator plans and Fusion Generator plans, purchased from Enclave Bunker several times now, do not show in inventory, more caps wasted and not easily obtain any more, what a shame?**
---
4. **Crafting Items are weighing too much, to save up enough scrap to have stock so I can concentrate on in gameplay and maybe not have to grind so hard as if I was a level, 1 player, I had a simple yet effective system to keep my inventory in line with my crafting needs for in-game supplies and now I feel all my hard work is gone, it makes me hate spending 20 hours to have 1 hr of fun, versus, 3 hrs of work for 5 hrs of fun!** 
---
5. **Weapons Damage, I had my end game gun, the controversial 2 shot, explosive shotgun, loved it, earned it, did not cheat, did not steal, but now I am punished and forced to find an alternative that remotely compares to the original damage, can’t kill anything anymore, and if I do, its at a huge cost, 1000 rounds per every 3 hours with not being able collect as much in-game scrap for crafting shotgun shells any more because of amount they cost to buy, and lack of plastic and lead in game! Thanks!** 
---
6. **Levelling up! I get it you want to make things balanced, but now it takes me approx 3 days to level up?! I not about the “one-upping” anyone,  but it was an incentive to watch your self make it to the next level! And where is the in-game balance for me at this point, I feel like I am being forced to start over again instead of being rewarded for my time in the game, as mentioned before I have done it without cheating, I just have time on my hands, and I am at level 205, 600+ hrs in game, I would have kept going but there is no incentive, just a slap in the face for stick with it and putting up with all the bullshit that keeps happening with the game and I have put up with more than most! I have supported your game through thick and thin. I hate to say it, guys like me are what make the game go around, regardless of are level, it pushes other players to play hard and stick with the game, we are there to help them show them the ropes and now I feel I am being pushed away, not sure why, other than Bethesda has made it that way!** 
---
7. **Nuke Launches are crucial to the in-game atmosphere, I love doing them on a regular basis, and so do so many other players we take turns, launching in the different areas of the map, it gives everyone some excitement, from watching them go off, or to playing in them! But now they are a complete joke! Scorch Beast queen cannot be killed any more, not sure what happened there, it was an opportunity to have fun with other players make new friends and help others achieve their in-game goals, gain crafting materials like rare in-game flux for power armour and other things. White Springs or Green Briar Hotel, was for building experience and for a good thrill, being chased around like a mad man, trying to kill all the glowing ones, now your lucky if there is anything at this location or any other place on the map, I loved when they kept respawning after you did your loop of White Springs, it made it fun, you wish it would last longer so you could get rewards for your work, after each kill you where given a treat, kind of like a cracker jack box. Now it is a joke your lucky if you get anything worthwhile, that you can sell trade or that is useful to help your character grow in the game?! Timing and amount of nukes you're allowed to launch should not be limited, it should be one after another, why not, it keeps you on your toes, it makes it own in-game content, I know it's not for everyone, but it was one of the high lights to the game unless the server kicked you off! Actually, it would even be more awesome if there was more of a mix of creatures at each nuke launch site to keep everyone, hoping and riding them out on the edge of there seats, but you need to level out the damage ratio to player level it is a disgrace, to say the least!**  
---
8. **Perc Cards and end game level! I get it, level 50 is supposed to be the end, but why! I should be able to keep adding my perc cards up until they are all used, yes I may be close to god mode, but if that is how I want it to be, because I have worked for it then that should not be an issue, it will lead to new  in-game incentive to get to a point that you can choose what mode you want to be invincible and lazy or less invincible and have to work harder for it. Just make the PVP restrictions amongst players! Same goes for weapons damage, as long as it is adjusted for the PVP, it should not matter what level and how many perc cards I am using, it is just another reason to keep playing the game. More crafting perc cards for different levels would be nice, for example, I want to craft a unique weapon made from three different weapons or armour so that I have a crazy custom weapon or armour, example double barrel explosive nuke rounds that are 600 damage or a 50 cal. Explosive or Ice rounds, or mix and match 50 cal. Shotgun, why not right, it keeps you going, or special forces marine-enclave hybrid armour that you can mix and match to build rare custom armour. Up the end game level to 1000 with special customizable power armour and gun as a reward to getting there, just food for thought!**   
---
9. **Atomic Shop! I would love to spend more time buying rare in-game items, but it always seems like it the same crap, I love the concept for themes, it works, but not everybody wants that!  This is supposed to be the wasteland, not the Care Bear count down, furthermore, I want to see more custom and crazy rare paint jobs, rare weapons or perc cards, custom plans, as mentioned before crazy customizable armours and weapons with no restriction to how you build them with the respectable level, other than towards other players in PVP!** 
---
10. **Camp and carry weight there needs to be more carry weight as you get to higher levels and you should be able to have a computer controlling your camp that way if someone or something is attacking your camp you can be notified and go and deal with it, same as damage of your camp should be associated with your level and perc cards used to build it!** 
---
**I apologize for giving up, but my hands are tied, I had great hopes for this game and I have tried my best to be understanding, I get it, we don’t live in a perfect world, I appreciate the hard work that has gone into making this a great game, but alate I feel kind of at a loss for why I should have to feel let down after every new update bring more and more crap to the game and more and more stuff being taken away from the game. I had so much fun before the last update and before the hotfix minus the server crashing every 15mins! I don’t expect you to listen to anything I have to say, I have made numerous attempts to forward my concerns, I kind of feel that I am talking to a wall at this point! So if anyone from your support team gets this and pass it on to, who it needs to be passed on to, just remember, I have been one of the players that have dedicated my time and effort into your game that has been through everything from the beginning up to this point, I just want the same as you and everybody else lets make Fallout 76 Great again, until my questions and concerns are addressed and my gameplay goes back to what was, once great! I will be saying farewell, I wish you the best, from my family to yours from the wasteland to the sad reality I call real life, lol! This MendedMantis1 Signing off for good! Till next time, I truly wish you and all the staff at Bethesda the best in your future endeavours. Dam, this not what I want to be saying, please, fix it, and take some of my words to heart, so I can have my "fix" of Fallout 76 again! Please, I beg of you!** 
---
**Kindest Regards,**
---
**MenededMantis1**                
---
Yay :D 
---
Thank you for letting us know &lt;3
---
I kinda want this but at the same time, how would they handle workshops with no PvP? In theory, with no PvP of any kind, you could go around and take control of every workshop one at a time and then just keep them by never logging out. Assuming the game is ever stable enough for it.
---
That's basically the system from FO3 and the TES games. They changed it to the current one in FO4 because all the Fallout grognards hated that Damage Threshold wasn't in FO3.
---
The current system could probably be salvaged without radical changes if they just copied the higher damage cap that FNV used. (The most that DT could reduce your damage by in FNV was 80%; in FO4/76 it's 91%.)
---
I am hoping that with the nerfs to explosive and TS that they bug overall gun damage across the board. We'll see if the overpowered tse was making them shy on buffs. Would be nice to receive some sort of reply on how they plan to address this
---
Been hopping for hours and no luck. Same plans over and over.
---
I enjoy having things others don't have. Keep it up Bethesda. I love my Blackbird PA paint.
---
Preach brother
---
&gt; But that's where most of the money lies these days, they have to turn this into a success
---
Which makes it all the more baffling why they released it like it was some side project that didn't need all that polish and finely tuned gameplay while they could just slowly patch things up with a post-launch skeleton crew like it seems that they're trying now.
---
last night I hit a level 8, I do not know if accidentally but I had to teach him a lesson, I threw him an orbital grenade When he returned to look for his things he ran scared xd. 
---
when we have features, I'll have a lot of fun being a raide 
---
Wow. Yet another screw you to energy weapons in 4.
---
Adrenal reaction and nerd rage
---
1. Agree about the ammo. 
---
2. Nowhere did this game or it’s makers ever promise you it’ll be a run and fun shooter. It’s not.  This expectation is something you’ve created in yourself, and it’s not the universe’s job to increase in you. It’ll never be met. 
---
This is 100% speculation. You are bitching about something that hasn't happend. good lord man. Pull your shit together.
---
Two things I have seen. The Purifiers only hold so much water. The big one only holds five, and the one that purifies well water only holds two. To get max output, you have to check the purifier every five minutes.
---
and then, sometimes you have to open the container on things like purifiers and ore machines before you see the results.
---
Hey everybody! Look at the cool guy here that doesn't use VATS!
---
But seriously, some of us use VATS to build criticals as part of the playstyle and not as a crutch. It would be nice if it was more reliable.
---
Things I've Bought:
---
 - Greaser Jacket
---
 - Original Wood Panels
---
 - Red Rocket Paint (Pip-Boy)
---
 - New Year Tuxedos (My Favorite)
---
I dunno waterfall is the development way of the future
---
 /s
---
The TSE weapons were best in slot depending on perk builds, and to find one in game is actually extremely extremely rare. There were perks that allowed these guns to one shot practically everything. The reason you see so many people complaining despite the weapons being so rare is because they were duplicated hundreds of thousands of times, so a lot of people bought them from these dupers. One of the biggest complaints is how much damage the end game mobs can take, and how much ammunition you need to use to kill them. High powered weapons like the TSE allowed players to play the game without constantly farming ammo and repairing weapons
---
And then another hour after questing managing my inventory and if I want caps for anything fast travelling to 7 different vendors...
---
oh! Interesting.
---
That TV show is only sorta kinda loosely inspired by the actual stories. 
---
Here's another example. I read up on the Lubbock Lights while watching that episode. In the show, they are in... 1952, I think. That's the actual year of the Lubbock Lights. But in reality, the professor didn't go investigate it until years later. 
---
The show is just taking inspiration from the stories, but doing their own thing. 
---
I am fine with that, it's been good so far and eps 3-4 were really fun. 
---
No idea, I thought Heavy Combat was the  best there was (non PA). 
---
So where did The scorchbeast come from if there were none ? Hm? I guess magical dragons you just come out of thin air after a post-apocalyptic event don't they? 
---
Holy!!! This is incredible thank you so much for sharing!! 
---
I'm more happy that the dense chest also negates the stagger that I kept getting hit with when they screeched. Now I can largely ignore them until they land.
---
Just stating the odds
---
You sound confused. Its a rare monster spawn. Not sephinroth.
---
Pretty sure if you die while over encumbered it severely limits your respawn options. 
---
Is this true? If so,  the art direction in this game is whack.
---
Sorry my platform is XBOX
---
I think flare guns are just cosmetic to get the attention of other players. In New Vegas it put abominations like deathclaws in a fear state, and in FO4 it summoned allies like Minutemen and vertibirds.
---
I don't know about raider PA plans but I'd probably check the raider vendors (Sutton station, Top of the World (2), R&amp;G station, Sunnytop station).
---
So the people that has been complaining are probably cheaters?
---
That’s what other players were / are supposed to do. We are supposed to do this together
---
One can hope...
---
I see where you're coming from, and yes, for the most part the building is fun and if you like it as it is, great! There have been a lot of creative builds out there, but there are also flaws that could be improved upon rather than using workarounds to make something perform in the logical way it ought to. 
---
I hope you also see how there is a community willing to offer ideas to be considered by the developers to improve that system for everyone. There may be some people that get a bit worked up about issues or restrictions, but to me that speaks of their passion for bettering these parts of the game. 
---
Pre and Post-War Enclave FEV experiments, that's how.
---
Oh I believe it, from what I've heard a military .50 cal rifle fully kitted weighs just around 10-12 pounds, and yet we have hunting rifles in game that can weigh 20+.
---
I agree- and even if not a timer then at least colour- code the event marker to indicate only 5 min left
---
Tldr
---
They're two item buffs, two shots for one click and explosive weapons, when combined and stacked with some perks they were OP as hell and they got nerfed cause it made a SURVIVAL game too easy.  The youth of today don't understand what it means to have a challenge in a game now so they're complaining.
---
Pretty sure they said there's no truth to the rumor that once it goes free to play everyone who bought it gets 500 atoms.
---
Also they were a lot of fun to use, now they a drag to use, break often, use 4 times the amount of ammo if not more. 
---
There are a lot of critical things wrong with FO76 but Bethesda chooses to work on easy target, constant crashes, freezing, frame rate drops, performance issues, they have tons to work on, nerfs weren't necessary although were annoying when they show up in nuke zones. Still they now a boring weapon. 
---
Ok, but what does that mean lol
---
What's a free drop? 
---
Same thing happened to me today, have they removed the last death symbol from the radar since the updates? Spent about 30 minutes looking for the poxy paper bag full of all my precious junk in long grass. Fallout isn't fun.
---
Or it's not locked and your water got jacked yo!
---
Literally the first time I ever went to white springs this bug happened to me and that was during the ‘Beta’. I never saw it again but I’ve you’ve had it then yea, certainly not fixed.
---
&gt; all those robots around watoga drop steel/aluminum/lead
---
Which is particularly fun after you complete the Watoga quest line that makes them ignore you until you attack them. You can run around killing them without being ganged up on by every robot in earshot.
---
Yeah it's a sad oversight. Only the worst version of the .44 supports it.
---
Oh snap true. Completely forgot about that. But to be fair A) It's not out yet. B) Could still end up with more content than this mess lol C) DIablo 4 could still be in the works.
---
You're right tho.
---
LOL. Just pointing out my headshots work.
---
 Look at it this way. I often shoot bugs out of the air with my Western Revolver. Boom you are gone. ;) Feels good. 
---
&gt; forces people into crit builds now which is pretty shitty
---
Made all the more shitty by the fact a crit build *needs* to be a VATS build too ever since they coupled the two mechanics in a bad attempt to make non-time stopped VATS seem like less of a gimmick.
---
The game play loop is transparent to those of us who have played the game a decent amount.
---
TIME = RESOURCES = (AMMO + DURABILITY ) = EXP 
---
This looks good on paper but they have done a horrendous job of balancing the (ammo + durability) part of it. 
---
For example:
---
**Single shot weapons** have access to VATS, Criticals and Sneak attacks. These increase ammo efficiency exponentially which in turn increases exp efficiency.
---
**Heavy weapons and Autos** do not have access to any of that, they burn through VATS too quick, can't be silenced, and Criticals only affect a single bullet. They also suffer from inbuilt ammo inefficiency (same resources for less exp) And massive durability problems. All in all these weapon types are an absolute hot mess and require vastly more amounts of time spent gathering resources (farming).
---
**Melee weapons** bypass the ammo part of the equation entirely, thus are incredibly efficient for turning your time into exp.
---
I must admit I have gotten bored and used artillery to level a base. I then let them take the bounty and repaired there base and droped them some aid items. Really I just wanted to see how high a bounty an artillery strike would give. One positive note tho is that the people running around with no caps getting high bounties get a lovely debuff to pvp damage so they are only doing 50% damage to other players for 3 hours in game. 
---
I'm not aware of a list like that, where it shows a good density of collectable, scrapable, stuff but this is pretty good for finding stuff in general: https://fo76map.com/
---
This game is still so easy 😀
---
He took Chems and had bloody mess
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I've felt this way since early December.  By then(a month or so after release) I was expecting the number of people who sub/comment here but dont actually play the game to move on to something else.  I still see these comments more often here than any other gaming subreddit.  Admittedly I'm not subbed to any other "controversial" AAA games like SWBF2 or the new battlefield so maybe this "i dont play the game, I only sub here for the drama" thing is more common than I'm giving it credit for.  Regardless there is still a vocal minority of haters on this sub who will upvote anything remotely negative, even the clearly BS posts like "my account got banned for no reason".
---
Can you make sure to unsubscribe from the subreddit?  
---
Your whining happening fairly regularly, and it's happening more and more. Beyond frustrating.
---
I give up, and I downvoted. Maybe next year you'll grow up.
---
Fallout is my favorite game series of all time, so I really didn't want to hear whining, really wanted this to work.
---
Vampire costume, Pirate hat, and a bunch of CAMP stuff.
---
Not necessarily, some people did find them legitimately in game, but most people who have them, myself included, bought them from other players, and those other players were more than likely people taking advantage of the bug.  The way the game is designed forces you to farm supplies to make ammo and repair weapons, and with the TSE weapons you were able to use far less supplies because it used less ammo, and didn’t degrade as fast because you had to fire the weapons far less
---
Previous games are irrelevant.   Single player open world RPGs are a different game from an  MP open world survival game.
---
Your basically pulling the same move as people who buy a new family pet of the same breed they had before. And  then seem confused why they don't behave exactly like their previous dog.
---
It does not, I have also given up on ever doing this event. Always 5 minutes or left when I get there.
---
I do like how all the mods and plans for Excavator P Armor is on the exact opposite side of the map from where you get/register the EPA, lol (the bot in Grafton town, not the train station)
---
Thanks 
---
If anything like my teammate the other day, he had his "recover your stuff" last death "mission" turned off in his pipboy tracking.  He kept getting angry that it wasn't showing up on his map like it should.  I asked "are you sure it's just not shut off?" "Of course it's not! .... oh wait, ya it is.  There's the marker".
---
I've gotten over 7500 atoms just by playing the game
---
Camps out side the golf club make great targets for orbital strikes
---
My m14 I think comes in at around 11lb dry, with a full 20round clip it would be closer to 15lb. Your right though a 50cal machine gun it self can be set up to be pretty light, it's everything that goes with it.
---
Nothing 
---
I'd server hop in Harper's ferry and just circle the town. If you get a scorched spawn transfer away, if you get feral or super mutants do a full clear. There are usually at least two close to the vendor.
---
•manta man costume (one of my favorites) 
---
•fish lamp 
---
•nuka cola quantum sign 
---
•bunch of poses for photo mode
---
The people who see it can take action by simply knocking it down.
---
Yeah that’s definitely another reason for the complaints, there are so many other things that should’ve taken priority 
---
Nope. I missed out on mosaic floors and they are no longer available. 
---
I would question his internet. It sounds more like diaper baby (OP) had a tantrum.
---
That is awesome. 
---
Nope, as far as I know the very few mods they do get, armor penetration is not among them. 
---
You're forced to try and find them as a drop with the armor pen effect, or use stabilized and power armor.
---
Is this a map of locations where you can set up a harvester? That's not exactly what I was looking for, but still helpful.
---
All six of us are very interested in what Bethesda fixes next.
---
Well said. This is so on point as they continue to bury this game. I ask myself if it's intentional some times. 
---
Why does this have so many upvotes? This is a litany of complaints that don't help anyone, and serves to make the Fallout community look like a bunch of little bitches
---
Is this is where I'm going wrong then I owe you a very big thank you.
---
*ch ch ch*

Hi most of today i keep bulking my junk then a little while later the bulk items are gone its happened twice today .
---
If you are "grinding" to handle thirst or basic maintenance, I don't know what to tell you.  I grab junk I need as I play, and just make sure I have food and water production at my camp.  It takes very little to cover your needs.
---
I did have to go farm lead once, but one trip to Lucky Hole Mine covered me for weeks.  I get plenty from cans and rat poison and whatnot.
---
It's also pretty super hilarious.  I mean, it's terrible, it's stupid, and it means that the game is super fucked up, but it's hilarious.
---
"It works."- that guy. 
---
Figured it was a pvp thing.  Something to keep players from making invulnerable bases or overlays for workshops.
---
Thank you too! Really I am very pleased that the BGS CM paid attention to my amateur art! :-D
---
Yes, how did we figure out how to create ammo but not take some apart again. How did we learn how to create these items out of junk ?

Turn Pacifict Mode on...no more friendly fire issues.

Indeed, mine is a TSE, real nice for mid level douchebag ghouls...used to work on the big boys before nerfesville....
---
If I remember right it's under Miscellaneous.
---
We should earn Bitcoin for playing 76.
---
They should've called it Fallout: Inventory Manager. 
---
I think it need human-fear-cores or something like that
---
Anti armor weapons go through sent/assassin gear and if they are using fast shooting explosive guns they actually make you move and make sent not work. 
---
I guess I only voted no because I kinda liked how it was done with the holotapes and didn't agree with all the criticism about that. But I'm sure they could come up with a lot of interesting ways to make it work, and still keep the feel of it as it is. So I'd vote yes for some kind of NPC or faction content.
---
Super mutants are way better imo 
---
But to announce a Mobil only piece of shit made in part by a p2p Chinese company AT BLIZCON...If that's not partially going full EA then...I don't even know.
---
I've been a hardcore Diablo fan since the beginning. This was enough to send me over the edge with them though.
---
"Do you guys not have phones?!?"
---
Yes you incompetent cunt, we also have microwaves, but we don't fucking cook filet mignon in them.
---
Curious if others, when they come across CAMPs, sometimes see "jsmith's C.A.M.P." and other times just "C.A.M.P." ? What determines whether or not a player's name is shown on the CAMP device?
---
It’s much more tedious, I grinded to get the white knight card at max rank and I enjoyed the hell out of the game. Being able to explore the map and do missions without having to worry about shattering my armor was great. Now I spend most of my time just going out to get materials to repair my armor and weapons and it feels much more like doing chores than playing a video game.
---
I would totally pay 1000 atoms for a full respec!!  I have two almost lvl 50 characters that are a hot mess. I don't want to delete them because of plans learned and time invested but it is going to take me a least another 50 levels to fix them. By time I get them fixed I will be so over leveled they will be no longer fun to play. 
---
Google.com is great, however it can be incredibly difficult to use, so I understand your decision to come and drop a shitpost to reddit instead. When you get on the site you’ll have a field where you can type. This is where you put what you’re looking for. I know, I know, it sounds crazy and unrealistic, but it totally works.
---
Now that you’re aware of this unbelievable website, I hope to never see you post again❤️
---
Nah people like you to think that is the case, I am not a cheater or a duper and the latest changes have been impacting me big especially the max weight limit which is painful to say the least . People like you to think it's the fanboys speaking out, but there are so many chronic issues right now. The game is still fun to play, but 50% of the game is broken .. I still play it and enjoy it, but I am not sure how much longer I can last.
---
Anyone who says the game is not broken, is simply lying.
---
I'd love for them to make a lot of cards passive, to be honest. Rework the system. 
---
I started using a Hunting Rifle again recently to burn through my massive stockpile of .308 after running extremely low on .45 and 5
---
56, and honestly, I've found myself preferring the snappy receiver over the hardened. Bumping up the fire rate by only 2 may not seem like much, but after actually trying it, it more than offsets the drop in damage. I'd still stick with hardened for stealth sniping, but if you're using it as your main rifle, I'd strongly recommend giving the snappy receiver a chance.
---
This guy vs Frank horrigan, who wins?
---
Or, a better idea, don't start the event timer if no one started the event, and then still show the timer after it is started. 
---
Game is completely broken.  430+ hours spent, and about ready to switch to Warframe full time.  The game is free, and doesnt crash 50 times a day and doesnt keep making things worse via "fixes".  How can Bethesda expect to keep its players like this?  The fanbase is furious.  Heads should roll for the shit show that is FO76.
---
They are probably wearing full sets of assassins armor. (-8% damage from players). 
---
this guy [https://imgur.com/a/anf7c4k](https://imgur.com/a/anf7c4k)
---
Yeah and this could actually be fun if it was driven by creators. Like how team fortress in quake was because it was a custom made idea with a single player / deathmatch fps program. 
---
The game Absolutely needs a creation club system to thrive. At bare minimum real modding support for the current live version. 
---
I would agree but I enjoy destroying the lag inducing turret camps at whitesprings
---
Better yet, refund my pre-order.
---
Should have gotten on that dupe gravy train early if you're not planning on playing anymore anyway
---
......could be an improvemnt. 
---
.......They could also not maginalize all of the perk cards so they are not the only reason to level up after lvl 60. 
---
They could also reduce the levels of cards and buff their per-card effectiveness. No crafting perk card needs to take up 5 to 6 slots just for crafting.(looking at you, science perk cards)
---
Make the crafting benefits fixed and take perks like weaponsmith be 3 to 4 cards with the same max benefit to item condition. 
---
I got sick of getting harassed by scorchbeasts at level 37 so I decided to take out the level 80 in the bog during this quest.  It was a total rush and took me down to the very last of my resources.  I felt a true sense of accomplishment.  Then I just got some marginal rewards and literally hours of farming to get back all that ammo (I was only 37 so it took over 600 rounds), repair my weapons and armor and farm stims back up. Soooooo I won't be doing that again anytime soon.
---
If you really want to kill one just for shits and giggles just do the Big Bend Tunnel and sneak past the last boss into the tunnel at the back and start attacking for an ez mode kill. 
---
You made the choice to use automatic weapons, which are inefficient and much less effective.  I don't know why you would do that.  I farm West Tek sometimes and use a few rounds per mutie on average (AP hunting rifle and a two-shot assault rifle).  They drop ammo and gunpowder, and I just need to grab a bit of junk to cover the crafting/repairs.
---
Level 52 here. I found one level 30 one when I was a level five on the western edge of the map up by the lumber yard. I sniped at him and he went VOOMP! and disappeared. Then last week someone nuked one of the minor fissures in the cranberry bog and I found a level 40 one there while I was out picking flowers. I decided to engage and much like the Mothman he does a lot of VOOMP!ing around but all in all a fairly easy fight. I have also encountered 3 mothmen all vicious or aggressive. Only one have I succeeded in taking down. The other flew off when I so much as looked at them.
---
HOWEVER I still have not seen a Mega Sloth yet. So hey there's that.
---
cheating will get you banned
---
What's this have to do with my post?
---
&gt;Didn't help that a bug was actively keeping me over encumbered. I watched as I moved a 20lb gun from my person to my stash, and my carry weight remained unaffected.
---
I saw exactly this yesterday too. Moved an auto grenade launcher to stash and the stash goes up by 20 lbs but my character weight stays the same. Issue persists even moving it back and forth a few times. I tried some other things and finally got it to recognize the weight drop on the char side. I think I had to exit the stash and then check inventory and then open the stash again or something.
---
I've seen some additional weight bugs earlier with Excavator (different from the extra 100 lb one that sometimes you get on login)
---
Sentinel's Assassin armor. -15% damage while standing still and -8% Damage from players multiplied by 5 pieces, no damage taken.
---
Truth is: Game was rigged from the start.
---
Best check you aren’t scrapping them as Bethesda bugged that in the one of the two updates recently.
---
Hhaha great look
---
You mean you don't love playing a game that *claims* you're suppose to rebuild the wasteland, but won't actually *allow* you to rebuild the wasteland??
---
That's very strange, as it is not my experience at all.
---
I have 2 industrial and 2 large, and in if each always fills up before the next begins.
---
You wanted to earn money playing a video game
---
That’s not toxic players that basic pvp you’re bitching bc you’ve been tricked. You’re outmatched get better or quit. 
---
Didn't this just suck the fun out of the game? If you already have end game stuff, you lose one of the main drive to keep progressing!
---
I agree on the learning note, but not sure I'm in line with you on how easy and casual this is. Things like survival (food/water/gear maintenance), open world exploration, little narrative guidance, a pretty complex perk pool, an imbalanced system, power growth inconsistencies between levels/areas/species (a level 20 super mutant is not equal to a level 20 snallygaster). Not to mention this being first person and three dimensional. Games like the Spyro or Crash Bandicoot remake are accessible, or Mario Odyssey even, are more open to people learning games. Games like this have much more depth than you realize when you've been entrenched in gaming culture for 10, 20, or more years. Those of us who started in Nintendo can't imagine what entering the space is now.
---
This is even better
---
I suggest you play the game &amp; find the mission that tells you what happened to the npc ghouls.
---
No, my friend has never ever built
---
In a camp, he operates from the truck stop workshop. 
---
Basically what wow did and it. Just in a different way, and dunno, it would kind of suck if enemies in the forest were scaled to my level. 
---
Confirming I have this issue as well. 
---
Accidentally lol, nah, gotta grind for that
---
What?  Armor absolutely has a lot to do with it, especially for low-damage-per-shot weapons.  You use automatic weapons and complain about ammo consumption, which is rich.
---
Because that's what dropped for me.
---
I'm a traditional Fallout player. No dupes. No in game trades. You play with what drops for you and auto seemed fitting for a quad explosive radium rifle with an 80 round clip.
---
First, the link was provided for the top comment, not the post itself. Second, there are some inaccuracies in your post. 
---
I don't even know what 1 is saying for certain, but if it's saying that the high-ROF weapons end up doing the same damage as high-DMG weapons, then it's just blatantly not true due to, well, the content of this entire post. That "50 dmg attack hitting 30 times a second" will realistically be doing 12 dmg and hitting maybe 10 times a second (ie minigun). Looking at the chart, that means each shot is doing about 2.2 dmg per hit against something with 100 armor (your average high-lvl super mutant). That means 22.2 dps vs my super sledge slamming into them at 500 dps. That's not okay.
---
And in 3, the real factor that you are leaving out of your theory crafting is accuracy. Sure, the math works that you are putting more damage down range, but chances are you are either firing in bursts or just wildly missing a bunch of your shots. Not saying your wrong, just saying you should consider how it works in practice, not how it looks on paper. 
---
they need to fix it
---
I just got marine arms there
---
There are two kinds of people
---
Full set of assassin sentinel 
---
Dense torso mod
---
Fireproof Dodgy Serendipity Lone Wanderer
---
Literally 99% damage resistance 
---
Oh man, I had no idea that was even an option. Thanks for that info!
---
Taking a break from FO76 until (if ever) Bugthesda gets their collective heads and asses wired together and starts to address actual problems.  
---
Additionally, I can only make the bug eye helmet that nobody wants except the one guy that was role playing the firefly girl on Gotham.
---
I’m really dreading it, because it’s the last bit of fun I have, but I’m willing to guess based on the accuracy of my past guesses that they won’t, because they favor it so strongly
---
Totally normal. Quest progress is "check pointed" and you wil it say that at the top let of the screen when you complete a certain "chunk" of a quest. 
---
For example...all three exercises are one "chunk" so if you stop after two and log off... you start over.
---
Haha Unyielding builds have to learn quickly not to log out in a popular nuke spot
---
He missed one thing. They were best in slot regardless what you used. Thing using out of spec stuff in mmo just cause it it that good. 
---
I meant the amount of work put into Fallout 76 is a bigger energy sink than mining Bitcoin.
---
Let's face the truth - Bethesda is dead.
---
People like me? The comment above was a question based on a previous answer.
---
I agree that there are many problems with the idea. It would only be practical if they could do it well and couldn't fix the fundamental problem. If it were done,  it would need to be separate from the game servers. Having it connected to the game servers would definitely make things messy.  It would be better than dumping stuff on an alt. 
---
As someone that has made a fair amount from this shit tier of a game I agree lmao. You’d be surprised how much people pay for a full set of Assassin Sentinel.
---
I really haven't played much since Beta tbh. It pretty quickly became clear that I was in for a long grind. 
---
People are complaining about lack of endgame content. I don't particularly feel like there's much game content period. Some of the locations are kind of neat (like the Civil War Battleground) but mostly it's just a big empty wasteland that didn't hold my attention very long. 
---
Precisely. They are limited to 5 because they produce while you aren't at them. 
---
It's not necessary to take them all down! I've just finished this mission and only killed one! You just have to run for dear life!
---
It was in fo4, idk why it wouldn't be in 76
---
I say this all the time.  Noone at BES play/test their game.   If they did most of these issues would have been seen right away.  
---
Been playing since beta.  And i had a rough time this weekend with shit going to shit.  
---
Now this was my first time getting bombarded with issues after issues.  I can fully understand now where some of this hate comes from. 
---
If i bought this game now, i would have tossed it already.   
---
Western duster, cowboy hat, string of lights (white) 
---
Xbox? Bro hmu GT: Blazingfrost05 I can help most of ur problems, pm me to talk about it
---
I've spent most of the last 3 or 4 days just grinding caps for plans, and stimpaks so I can actually get through a mission in the wendigo cave. I'd like to at least finish the story, but I'm pretty much blocked on quest progress until I do that mission. More often than not, I have found myself just trying to figure out something to do in the game that's half-way interesting.
---
i don't think they ever played or even LOOKED a mp game in their lives before making this game
---
I enjoy the game despite all the issues but the people experience is a give or take for me. I tend to get a lot of one night stands. We team, we enjoy we friend on Xbox and in game and I never seen or hear from them again. Maybe it’s the bathrobe or beer hat I run around in. I look for teams and always send out invites and rarely ever get anything back. But I will continue to explore the wasteland anyway. 👍
---
No you're definitely right about all of that, but the only thing I can suggest is try grinding with friends, it makes it way easier to get what you need. Otherwise, Google good spots to farm ballistic fibers, i did that with springs and now im a springs millionaire, lol. Im on ps4 but id be down to help you out if ya need. 
---
If it’s cool I want to see
---
I love this idea. It also works for people who don't fast travel for roleplay reasons. 
---
My boyfriend works at the hotel and was part of setting up the event. Said it was one of the cooler events he’s set up, despite the nerds lol. (I like video games, he does not)

they added rainbow babies?

XBox One S

Tried to take the sunny meadows workshop place just now.

Had two floating markers for enemies twice the height of my character. No enemies to be found.

Spawning in the floor was one thing, but this is something else entirely.

---
I mostly leave them alone.
---
[Mostly.](https://i.imgur.com/RAJaqUL.jpg)
---
I can't even do quests at this point because of the combination of armor deterioration, weapon deterioration, struggle to find/make ammo, and the amount of damage weapons actually do to enemies. Playing is nothing BUT grinding.
---
This. I loved the idea of this game, but the grinding is just brutal. Server crashes seem to be more common now. With my limited play time (a couple hours a week, maybe 5 hours) and trying to keep up with my friend that is left that plays this is just too much. I have stuck up for this game since I bought it, but enough is enough.
---

I'm starting to think Bethesda has imposed a similarly restrictive character limit in their coding deck as they have to our stash boxes. In order to add new code to fix a bug, they need to delete some other code somewhere else, creating a new bug.
---
We need a shareware system to bring friends in and interact with them without having t be -wAste your money on this game you might hate -
---
No thanks anyway they just disappeared lol
---
When is the next patch?  Give us a date.

I thought you were going to say "We also have microwaves, but we don't want a Diablo game for it!" And started crying from laughter lmao.

I'll make sure I horde all I find lol

---
They are in the game, they are dead too. The scorched plague doesn't discriminate
---
Seems OK at my medium settings, just this melee fire lag, I'd suggest you buy your brother the game now, it's reasonably cheap.  I have turned off grass in fallout76custom.ini that was a clincher, made it much smoother, looks better too my eye also, less fussy.
---
On PC and the game is basically OK, barring the disconnects.
---
From a post of mine.
---
*These Fallout76Custom.ini edits made all the difference to the game for me, with only an msi gtx750ti the grass was a killer. Looks better with no grass in my humble opinion, can actually find the golf balls. Whitespring was impossible before removing the grass.*

Vsync off in nvidia control panel, only change removed micro stutters, did introduce some tearing but nothing too bad.
---
I was just thinking the other night that this game is more like a shitty second job than a leisure-time activity.
---
Plan out your build ahead of time.
---
It has to be connected to the game servers or it would be another source of duping bugs.
---
Haha okay I'll prob stay hidden and away from people I'm kinda scared lol 
---
Okay I'll definitely do that !!
---
&gt;they got nerfed cause it made a SURVIVAL game too easy...
---
and what about Melee?
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
That still means the problem lies with the player.  
---
At that level, you're simply doing it wrong if it takes 4 shots to kill a level 5 mob.
---
 Yeah you get that too. BOS plans. underarmor etc. But its not the same now, which is why I said 'used to' as I dunno if its changed.
---
Not to be rude, could we please get some human feedback? I am getting tired of the runaround! none of my questions or concerns, have been reviewed or answered yet from, day 1? 
---
Just killed an hour reading through all the comments on this thread and you all gave me some commiserated Loling. Fallout ppl are my ppl. 
---
Yeah i have a junk miner in the center of my base though...
---
I think you can just run from tower to tower and ignore the beasts. I killed them with a team, but a friend completed belly of the beast way before I felt comfortable by running from tower to tower.
---
Strange, your experience is different from mine. I've got more ballistic fiber then I ever use, I carry around 10 different weapons (with ammo), sure I'm always encumbered but it's how I played FO4, I can easily switch weapon to match the situation. I've got 10 fusion cores in my stash, and I'm lugging 35 around with me, but I'm not actively looking for them. Either stumble across them or quest rewards. I don't want more.
---
Best option is go sniper with a rifle, switch to 10mm or shotgun when things are getting a bit too close for comfort, then a melee weapon if they are just not getting the message.  
---
You shouldn't have a need to make ammo at your level, but remember to loot everything, scrap it down, bulk up and sell excessive stuff (you don't need more than 100-200 of each component) and you'll easily get the caps coming in.  
---
You could always find someone to make you some gear, I'm on PC and would be happy to help.  
---
I don't find the game hard or tedious, if anything, it's too easy.
---
After Level 50 you only get a new pack every 5 levels I believe.
---
And post lvl 50 no special points at all other than swapping them around.
---
Silver Shroud costume and vault tec floors.
---
I missed the opportunity for mosaic floors or I would have bought that too.
---
Now you scrap it. That's the point of having the plan, to make and scrap them for mods.
---
&gt; So I have 5 in makeshift warrior, 5 in gunsmith, 5 in Demo expert
---
But that's not worth 15 points wasted in Int since you'll always have a dead card: Makeshift Warrior or Gunsmith depending on what type weapon you're using. I could understand if it was 1 or 2 maybe 3 points just for convenience but 5 is quite the commitment.
---
This game is basically 'easy', or 'normal' beyond the starter zones, based on the difficulty selection of past vanilla Fallout game.
---
So personally, naw, I don't mind any of the changes. One of my personal criticisms is that this game is too easy and too rewarding. All sense of survival mostly went away around level 15-20, and ammo and medicine mostly stopped being a problem for me by 20. Enemies can be tough if you're undergeared and underleveled for where you are, or if you're just unlucky and get swarmed, but generally the game is not a consistent challenge at all.
---
Personally, it's still not nearly hard enough for me. I want a hardmode. 
---
Build twenty more to scrap so you can learn the mods
---
 Now you scrap it. Get to work. ;)
---
Yep, just avoid them. Terrible durability. No resistance penetration in a game where resistance exponentially reduces damage and goes way higher than base damage of weapons. Resistance penetration is so important in this game because of resistance creep, it's a key reason why incisor is essential to melee builds.
---
No its pretty toxic, could have easily joined a team or whatever, instead decided to wait on a lower level player to build up their shop just to go and kill said player who they clearly know cannot fight back. "Get better or quit" is funny though, as you can have one set of armor and that makes you able to out class anyone else, thats not really being good at the game its just abusing a broken mechanic
---
Seems to be the same across all platforms.
---
The limit is ridiculous. I could understand an "item" limit, due to database size or whatever, but a quantity limit (weight) is so stupid.
---
We are investigating infinite loading loot, I'm looking into this to see where we are at on the Dev side of it.
---
craft up a bunch of level 25 versions and scrap them until you get a bunch of mods.
---
Go farm up them screws.  Good thing is you usually get about 1 mod per scrap (until you near the end of the available mods).  Unlike armor scrapping.
---
Because you can't have your cake and eat it, too. In the end, this is a business that created a game to make money off of your continued play time and you have to recognize that.
---
Yes, happened to me once after killing a scorchbeast which was super annoying. 
---
Or not pvp, like most players. Since this isn't a pvp game setup for pvp at all.
---
anyone know how many mods there are for it?
---
Stopped playing. Nerfing weapons, nerfing white knight and nerfing explosions. I dont have time to grind shit to repair my armor/weapons and scavenging ammo for hours just to use it on the queen in minutes.
---
It’s to stop dupers. There’s apparently a method they were using that utilised multiple Modus terminals at once.
---
In an effort to get round it, only one terminal works in each section now.
---
In the military wing bit it’s always the middle one for me.
---
Oh yeah, keep doing this and implement them in the game when they add private servers and mods!
---
Be honest though, killing a legendary is not killing a dungeon boss. You can be walking down the road whistling dixie and a legendary enemy falls right in your lap. There is no trash clearing most of the time, no grueling challenge, no wings to clear, no elite boss abilities. It's just a slightly tougher enemy that gets a heal off and has a chance to drop a legendary. 
---
If they dropped them every time the game would be way too generous. People complain about this often and I always shake my head because it really seems like they don't understand that if your chances at a legendary were good, you would be swimming in gear in a week and end up bored as shit.  
---
More of a grind for sure.
---
\^ Correct. From our [Known Issues and feedback list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/), we are looking into implementing this later this year.
---
this.
---
I missed being able to get everything easily and being able to serverhop :(
---
It is fun help folk. 
---
Gorge Junkyard. About a week or so ago, I was running around there, looking for firecaps to make some drugs for a daily challenge. A level 10 player had claimed the workshop and I noticed they were in Morgantown when a level fifty something trots in there, looking around for the low level in full PA, then claims the workshop for him/herself. I figured the low level must've noticed the high levels at the workshop so didn't bother returning. 
---
I know it's apart of the game and all, but it still feels scummy to me to contest someone's workshop. So, I invited one of my buddies over with me, we're both in the high hundreds, and basically we just run up to the guy, invade his personal space for a few, jump around the workshop, and the dude just logs off. 
---
Didn't bother claiming the workshop, didn't kill anyone, and went off on our merry way. I do hope that low level reclaimed his workshop, though. 
---
Oh yeah I like what the've done, I personally would like NPC's in as a "chapter 2" of the story, so the queen is now dead and its beginning to get a bit safer in the wasteland now so roaming bands of people and raiders start coming back to the region and begin settling small villages
---
Sucks that’s it’s only one weapon :/
---
What does tse stand for?

Way to show respect to the community manager with your words. Now, if you can do it with your username as well, you’ll be at a reasonable baseline of respect.
---
The disgusting, whiny hordes of Reddit do not represent us.
---
Interesting, I may try to talk him into it. Then again I have Anthem in my sight, just waiting for more feedback before the plunge.
---
I was going to ask this exact same question. What are the best mods? Also are the plans spawning more frequently since the update? Seems that way.
---
Posted before...

You’re welcome. 
---
If only servers allowed more than 24 players. You could have a party by the river or stumble into cool places like this more often
---
It would even be a different thing if you \*could\* reliably go farm something and know you would come away with something. Same with events. As-is, you basically pay a fast-travel fee to do something with no guarantee you will actually be able to complete the event, or that there will be anything there to farm. Yeah you can re-log, but that's still never a guarantee and it's a crap solution anyway. 
---
Nerf that too.
---
I don't really know how it works. It seems to change, though. I had a teammate that could use terminal #3 but I had to use terminal #2. If they were using theirs I couldn't use mine and vice versa.
---
This one has been B L E S S E D by the holy Mothman!
---
I know! It’s like I was told that’s what the game would be. How dare I. How. Dare. I. 
---
But for real, how hard would that be to implement? Minecraft does it, and has done it for a long time. Does that mean they would have to have stable servers, or, heaven forbid, moderators? 
---
Those games aren't CRPGs...  which is the genre Fallout comes from.   Its got depth but nothing that cannot be learned for a bit of reading.  The games you're talking about are kids games, of course they're more accessible.  For its age category/audience - the only excuse I can think of is the lack of willingness to read/learn/research.   Fallout to me is way easier than Skyrim/Elder Scrolls games and other CRPGs like the Witcher series.  Ok so maybe its not as easy as Legends of Zelda.
---
I wish all the mobs would aggro on the lower levels solely during the fights, it would help fix this problem. Not SBQ, she would probably glitch out. 
---
Also, since the shed is the exit for [Glassed Caverns](/spoiler) mobs should be spawning in there as well. It would solve the problem very quickly. 
---
So, Arktos Pharma of Mama Dolce's?
---
It wouldn't matter but right now it does.
---
I agree but selfishly I’d like to see it be a heavy so we could get the benefit of 90% weight reduction and stabilized. 
---
Cryolator is only 13 lbs before mods so it wouldn’t be too crazy. 
---
But as long as they fix it so it’s one or the other I’ll be a happy man
---
Get Enforcer 15% chance to stagger. Or hit them with a super sledge. That will stagger them, then that -75% is gone. Radium rifle also does radiation damage. I'm not sure how good that would work but could be something there.
---
Its an exceptionally rare spawn. You're the reason 76 sucks
---
I honestly have not had many bad experiences with griefing players.  Maybe I'm just lucky.
---
All of those points are petty things, I have no idea how you're comfortable taking those and applying them to the argument of the game being tedious. 
---
Other than that, 'anyone who plays the game' is pretty much always a stupid lead-in to an argumentative point. I play the game 'for real' and I don't find those things tedious at all, they're easy to manage and take little time out of my play session. 
---
If I recall correctly datamining suggests that there will be an engraved Western revolver as well.  
---
"Colorful forest," and underwater, north of "a tree."
---
Yeah, that narrows it down.
---
&gt; Also are the plans spawning more frequently since the update
---
The update pretty much guarantees it's going to be there.  I've never seen the handmade plans _not_ in stock.
---
Different areas have a level minimum and maximum.  Some areas have no max limit however.  The Forrest for instance will not have anything over 15 I believe so even if a level 300 is there the enemies wont be over 15. It may suck but try to stay in some of the lower level areas until you are geared to combat the higher level enemies 
---
Bingo.  They bought powerful stuff early, raced to the end game content cause nothing was then a challenge and now fill this subreddit with posts calling for more content.
---
Some of those weapons (like the gauss rifle) could make sense. With the invention of power armor, I could imagine the military just making really powerful guns that would normally be impractical for normal infantry due to the weight.
---
But even the freaking *hunting rifles* go up to 18 lbs. It’s dumb.
---
They're insane if they think I'll want to take twenty years just to try out a new build, either via perk reallocation past 50 or starting a new character after all the nerfs.
---
Sure ill be on in 30 min 
---
As long as they buff ranged and not nerf melee I am fine with any balaning they FINALLY get around to
---
A moth-wing cape anyone?
---
I am really excited to have found a beer hat since my character is an absolute drunk. Just wish it gave some bonus for all that liver killin I am currently doing.
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
It's too bad they are married to their 18 year old game engine. I went from playing RDR2 a bit to fo76 around launch and thought "This is seriously their game engine?" It was just comically bad in comparison.
---
 You won't find them in the Forest area. They will only be common in higher areas. Each area can spawn monsters at its particular level, which gets higher as you go east. 
---
 This might help:

---
Exactly. Even though it matters now, we should direct our frustration at Bethesda and stop villifying other players. 
---
Nah, most people are cool on PS4. I've been on from day 1 and have only met 2 jerks. One nuked me the other brought a sword to a gunfight, lol. I don't team up with anyone but I usual have a pile of stuff to trade/sell. I'm thegunguyinc on PS4
---
A rollback to before the most recent patch and hotfix would be fine with me.
---
Vendor runs are pretty much the only "daily quest" the game has though.  Not much point in playing daily other then that.
---
Holy crap. 
---
Yeah, the concept was being a crafter. You need 5 for the highest mods. 
---
The 5demo exp was for pre Nerf explosives like my Fatman grenades and launchers which were all used frequently. Most certainly wasn't wasted though. 
---
But post Nerf, I'll likely switch those to another special just haven't found anything specific yet.
---
Based off the description, the intelligence actually increases condition of crafted items and at 15, it made a decent difference when I crafted my X01. 
---
Although the crafting concept in this game is irrelevant, there hasn't been any real perks that I don't already have that are essential for melee, so really any other perk or special would just be "wasted" 
---
So, sometimes weapons on gun braces can be invisible for whatever reason and if the trap is triggered, even if the trap has been disarmed, the trap will still shoot you despite there being nothing there.
---
I'm stuck on 6/10 feral golfers. Just can't bloody find them anymore
---
Yeah Awareness is one of the most useful perks for being able to tell when my minigun is going to act as a squirt gun haha.  The Stabilized perk helps quite a bit for Heavy Guns but anything with more than 100ish DMG resist is still nonviable.
---
Even make it so you buy a “plot of land” with x amount of caps. I don’t know what it would take necessarily, but when the game implies you’re supposed to help rebuild civilization and do this with OTHERS, it’s kind of hard when neither of that is happening. 
---
Is it possible you were recalling the doors to the outside shops, and not the outside individual suites? I know the first few weeks I was extremely confused by the resort layout and it took me awhile to figure out where I was at. I haven't ever seen those outside locked suites open myself. 
---
I found ghoul population a bit of a luck of the draw thing. Sometimes I luck out and somebody new enters the area causing another set of spawns. Usually it's the opposite and I find somebody running the opposite direction from me has already cleared many of the triggered spawns. I've lately been in the habit of waiting 10 minutes after dropping a nuke to avoid that first mad dash chaos.
---
I won't be on until around 630ish MST
---
I'll add you- will be off work and home in just over an hour and I'll be on most of the night :)
---
4000 atoms 😉😂
---
Met some cool people thru reddit!! I'm in the UK but I work nights so I'm never on at the same time as my friends but thankfully there are actual nice people who enjoy the game out there!! I play on xbox and I'm usually on around 10pm PST 1am EST. Feel free to join us I'm lvl 60 and my new friend is lvl 50, DM your gamertag and we will see you out there in the wasteland!!
---
That will help.  Thanks.  But its still something that needs to be fixed.  Or at least a map similar to this should be provided to new players by default.  Just something to warn them of what level each area is.  Hell, maybe even an ingame announcement when they cross a level border.  "Hey, be careful, the enemies in this area are considerably stronger than you."
---
You can be sure they didn't
---
I have posted about this as well. Guess we all need to start opening support tickets. Right now these Raider players are simply griefers who get a sick thrill. There is no easy way to penalize them or get back the resources to rebuild your CAMP
---
Well it is a pvp game and it isn’t you are literally agreeing to pvp by claiming a workshop. 
---
Please, For the Love of All Things holy, never put a deathclaw in power armor.
---
A week late reply there. I don't always feel comfy replying to somebody without having in store the same amount of text as they did, but your comment was way too informed for my humble person!
---
Anyway, I have been thinking about overused themes and while nuka cola didn't bother me in Fallout 4, I think *Vault-Tec everything* is a more striking example to me. It feels like they take took much room nowadays, as opposed to the post-apocalyptic people who are there. Maybe they are there thanks to Vault-Tec but that doesn't matter. This company is a bit too emphasized in recent games. 
---
I hear you, the holotapes are so good in this game. I was exploring Morgantown airport a little better and I found the note at the garden that was filled out by a young girl right next to a petrified scorched.
---
I made this post 100 days ago, I quit this empty, uninspired game long ago
---
Brucey Bonus, I popped for that
---
Not sure how it works exactly but seems to be the lower the level players in the area the harder she is. That's what I've bith read and noticed. But agree it isn't a great game design. 
---
I would like servers to be leveled. It would be hard to play with friends of a different level tho. 
---
Just because most players don't PvP doesn't mean that it isn't an aspect of the game. There is a PvP system in the game setup for PvP. 
---
it looks like Clockwerk from the Sly Series, badass
---
100% everyone is still going to be dead. The amount of work required to add a bunch of interactable npc's to the game would be huge.
---
Zero chance that bethesda puts that much work into a dlc. That would be like creating an entirely new game.
---
Yeah but I was responding to you as you had a question mark. I was just commenting ..

do not take it badly bethesda, we only want what we pay

Praise glory of the mark of Atom!

Yeah I logged out at white springs once and cams back later on into a nuke zone 😂 instant death but I shouldn’t have logged out there. I made it like five steps then died. 
---
Exactly, it would be there in the files. Just trolls trying to get people on a wild goose chase. If I found something cool and rare I'd be wanting to show everyone not some cryptic bullshit with no evidence. 100% hoax
---
Dont try to write stuff of like that. If you think the game is bad just say it. If "being a part of the game" is an excuse, then I guess EA is off the hook. 
---
Because this is exactly what the damn things need... Power armor. 
---
Beautiful work tho. 
---
I'm not sure how the memory/server limitations work other than Bethesda has stated that the stash issues are related to server stability.  That is why one of the suggestions I made was to make dedicated slots that simply increment a counter for things like base crafting resources and a few dedicated slots for other items that don't stack easily.  80 to 85% of my stash weight is crafting resources.  Don't ask me why....  I just seem to have some behavior about hording crafting materials, but it would be nice to stash some other items as well and definitely the ability to transfer them between alts.
---
 maybe a small town, like diamondcity give us missions and other things 
---
Level 130+ now (I really don't remember once I log off)  
---
About 10 flatwood monsters so far, got 5 preserved pies from machines... 
---
This is where my luck goes.
---
It’s a part of the game not a broken mechanic. If you don’t like the game don’t play it. All of the things you’ve complained about are parts of the game that you purchased. You’ve been tricked by one of the oldest pvp tricks in the book and now you’re salty. Ppl been doing this since Starcraft not exactly a new tactic. 
---
Yeah they sure are, but they rare, just watch your back, if they start on you either leave and switch sessions or just block and report them. Anyone messes with me they get two negative reports and blocked from both my accounts including any friends they with, I don't care, they all get reported .. but they rare so doesn't happen often at all, but I always keep and eye and never respond or engage.
---
That’s where I reached level 100, no trophy :/  
---
Hardly even see any talk about trophies/achievements unlocking except for a few people here and there.
---
I had some spawn there yesterday (PC). Between that car and the various fire bases, plans spawn for these and other relatively rare items. I make a circuit of the Mire and come across at least one or two new-to-me plans every day, even at level 150.
---
WTF. I have no legendary crap, well a Regenerating arm I found and my level 52 in BOS Combat Armor did most of the work of 3 level 80 Scorchbeasts at Whitespring. I hunt 50s for sport and take almost no damage from them.
---
 I use a good Level Action and the Sword of Bastet and its not expensive, I have trouble using up .45 ammo any other way and I have so much.
---
&gt; They seem to think there is this huge untapped player group just salivating to PvP
---
Because there is. Just look at all these people playing Fortnite and Pubg? Can you imagine if they could lure even 10% of them over to fallout 76?
---
In reality those people are unlikely to be swayed by whatever nonsense bethesda adds to the game. But I'm guessing that some overly ambitious suit made a really convincing powerpoint presentation during a staff meeting and so here we are. Stuck as bethesda tries to lure players from disparate genre's into the game, at the cost of the games original fans.

You need to equip the power armor perk card that enables you to put mods on pa.
---
You mention being level 30 and needing 5 hits to kill a 5 supermutant, your weapons are just bad in that case.
---
Yo im on ps4 too. Im lv 47 and my gamertag is cool2003guy. Im on on weekends and fridays if u wana team up. Me and a friend of mine are looking for people to team up with.
---
Same here, now and then it happens but very rare. Most people are cool and just want to explore, only the bored douche bags. Anyone comes close to my camp, I session block them, I trust no one.
---
This /\ is very important.
---
It's heavily flawed and almost seems to be a punishment for being loyal. 
---
They blamed doing for server instabilities. Yet they're still unstable?
---
That aside...
---
I still enjoy the game.
---
But, I solely attribute that to the group of friends I have in the game. We trade amongst ourselves and have a great time. We're usually close to one anothe.  e don't lose much junk if we died and DCed. Cause we'll sit on any bags until they rejoin.
---
TLDR: It might be a shit sandwich.
---
I'm just happy to see there's corn
---
I don't mind hard (I beat Bloodborne), but it's also got to be FUN.  Bethy is taking out the fun as they go along and that sucks for longevity and replay value.
---
I think the vision was for a rust like fallout and it and the new pvp balances and focus kinda support that IMO. The very first things I read about this game was that it was gonna be a rust clone months before any real info was out for BGS. Survival mode wont be for everyone for sure jus like other brutally hardcore games arent. It's not bein griefed if you know what you sign up for and in that light most ppl on the new mode will know what will prob happen(raiding and killing). If you jus stay in adventure mode it cannot inconvenience you and griefers and the pvp ppl will be out of you way  so why even be salty?? I dont care what the strongest builds are either and I'm def not setup as one I play how I feel is best for me so I'm max AGL high AP in heavy raider/heavy metal armor. I wish ppl would understand that the new pvp stuff fixes a broken/missing gameplay loop. I also dont understand how ppl dont see how so very similar to rust and ark this is at this point.
---
And it's horse shit, so almost no one participates. 
---
*Hurumph*
---
I eat a fist full of adderall and sit there and build and rebuild my camp for hours on end. Seems more fun then rushing to the end game and just fighting the SBQ on a loop
---
It's a pve game with minor pvp systems that no on does.
---
damn I wish.  I was more like the low man on the totem pole so it was "You get all the mobs while we focus on the Queen".  I was bashing that damn queen with my All Rise and whenever I heard, "Get this stupid scorch off of me", that's my cue!
---
I just added you- I'm lv. 153, looking forward to it
---
Yeah from what I've seen, Fallout76 has nothing to offer against The Division 2 unless you're purely here for Fallout lore.
---
The little maintenance building off of a parking lot to the one side of the resort, even though it's not marked as part of the quest, does count. At least four of my seven that I got were inside that building.
---
Im really sorry im new to reddit 
---
I play on ps4 and im trying to get an explosive any level
---
heh
---
I'm just impressed you use the word shrubberies.
---
Agree completely.  That is what I'm asking for is that stackable items have fixed slots and provide a few slots to store other items.
---
Why would a casual care about serum plans in the first place?  That's only useful for the folks that want to sell them and don't have the time to farm SBQ.
---
Ballistic fiber isn't needed for armor under level 25. Maybe just rock some level 20 stuff until you hit 40 and can pick up White Knight.
---
Man, that sucks... now I really want his alien suit :*(
---
Not sure.  I just adore allll the different types and names
---
Our HS ROTC drill team used M14's, they were 11 pounds and change, and it hurt when an errant flip caused one to hit you in face.
---
Ill see if i can add you today
---
Mind someone fresh out of the vault? My friend might gift me the game in a few days and I might need some help getting started in the wasteland.
---
I guess the point of playing daily is playing \^\^
---
If it was PS4, I'd game up.  I'm looking for a solid group.  I was planning on putting a clan website up for this game, but when the 8 people I got to buy it all stopped playing, I figured that would be a waste of time. 
---
Haha probably
---
Felt ripped off by this encounter? Welcome to the summary of Fallout 76.
---
I’ve wanted to be able to change the hud colour.
---
I think if you help defend the workshop you should get the minerals and junk the workshop has as rewards. Then it's still coop. Make the extractors work like other containers with seperate loot pools for everyone.  Only if you join the defend event.
---
Thank you so much for letting me know that 72 days after I posted this. 
---
Tank killer doesn’t stagger. Shotguns have one of the highest stagger rates.
---
Agree, it’s a lot better now.
---
Not at all....it's not like a single player  with easy normal hard modes.....it's should be on the higher side of normal to hard....
---
If you mark items with especially rare materials it makes it easier to find and know what to pick up, like ammo bags can give ballistic fiber. And also enemies are already easy enough and it bores me that I can nearly one shot level 60 enemies (a part from scorched beast) so yes I think maybe you need to reevaluate your tactics
---
Sentinel assassin will be hit by a meteoric nerf once survival comes. 
---
That workshop can be sealed off anyway. Close it and set the spawn mat in the office upstair with two doors,lock 'em with lvl 3 locks,and place two rocket turrets inside guarding the spawn mat.   they will spawn inside the office,trapped,with two turrets.
---
 It does need to be fixed. Level scaling is fucking evil and makes it hard for me to get a challenge.
---
GT: Amazing Viper X
---
I'm lvl45. I have no decontamination shower either. :(
---
There is no way in hell you can get a perfectly preserved pie from a machine that's just Bethesda trolling us with them
---
It would make a big difference because there's a very small limit to the kinds of scrap. After you have one of each kind, the number you have of it doesn't change how heavy a server load it is. That doesn't apply to weapons and armor because each one has mods, condition, and legendary effect options. They could actually make the server load *less* by dropping the stash size back to 400 but having it ignore bluk junk. Not *all* junk, just bluk junk. Then there would actually be a use for bulk junk other than selling it, people would have more room in their stashes, and the server load would be lower.
---
The management is the problem. I'm sure the coders are fine people.
---
last night had a player hang out inside whitesprings. my friend says"hey he killed that dude" what? a min ago they were trading? so i watch.he stands around for long lengths waiting. a new person comes in and he invites to trade. she passes. he waits more. gets tired of waiting and watches me. messes in his pip and pulls out a claw. i get a whack while in the ammo bench. dude no,thumbs down. nope the emote telling him no does no good and we play ring-around-the-rosie around the ammo benches. which has me laughing. he is tring hard to murder me.
---
i hop next to the vendor and he tries to get next to me but dont swing. the robots will have his butt for dinner if he hits it. ring-around-the-rosie- again around the vendor. persistent little bugger. my buddie gets involved and takes a hit where his body shock went off. welp, the robot was next to him and plenty more showed up and surrounded him. he leaves to de-aggro robots and i outside. the player finally gave up tring to murder me.
---
Yeah, just another gating mechanic. Workshops don't seem to have the same restrictions.
---
Wups, I’m totally wrong apparently. Tank killer has a 9% stagger chance, Enforcer has a 15% chance for shotguns 
---
Seriously, I feel like the game forgets it is *competing* for my time when I have plenty of other games to play. Making the game more tedious is not gonna draw me back in, and that is all they have done so far. No new content like perks/weapons/missions/enemies, no reworks for things like nuke codes or Scorched Beast Queen, no changes to trading to make the economy relevant, etc. If I was trying to get people to quit, I do not think I could do it better than them tbh.  
---
Why is it horse shit? Because you're mad? 
---
Was hoping for human power armor that resembled deathclaw stylings but was not disappointed with the inverse. 10/10
---
Ok
---
How did you get the leather coat?
---
Wow. That makes so much sense. 
---
If you wind up in pvp it’s bc you initiated or agreed to it call the game whatever yo want pvp is a part of it and bitching about that is lame af. Ppl need to quit crying to Reddit that they lost in pvp it’s so lame. Like go play fallout 4 or wait for fallout 5 if you’re gonna be a little bitch play by yourself. 
---
This is EXACTLY where my girlfriend and I are.
---
We are constantly hounding for more ammo and food/water. We get MURKED any time we try to quest because we keep hitting way out leveled enemies. We can barely play the game anymore without us both getting frustrated; and I‘m not easy to anger about anything. I find the only enjoyment I get is that I play with my girl, not the actual game.
---
I just killed my last ghoul golfer on the highway outside the Whitespring near the crashed cars on a Messenger event at level 110. I was alone for the event, but didn’t pay attention to how many people were nearby. So you don’t have stick to only the golf course.
---
Haven't played in a while but we played on pc. Most of the game is fine to play solo or in small groups (there were 2 of us). There are a few raid dungeons and bosses for large groups but it's easy to drop in and out
---
I support this. I also feel like we should be able to barter with the vendors for stuff instead of outright selling it: the economy won’t be worse off for it 
---
I'm a level 98 and I've been using a sniper since the start. I can one shot anything but scorch beasts. Your perks aren't where they need to be if you can't kill anything 
---
Assassin/Sentinel is very much a broken mechanic.  He can't get better other than hoping an old duper still has a set to sell.
---
Sure, if there is a better way to manage it and it provides a solution that satisfies the majority whilst bringing stability to the servers.  Why not?
---
At this point I'm starting to suspect either bots or those that dispose and vaguely positive comment.
---
I love my m14 but I do have respect for the soldiers that had/have to tote them around.
---
I've never had a TSE so I can't compare, but I craft bullets constantly. I farm steel, lead, and lately gunpowder (and acid for the steel and lead), and it's honestly hard to keep above "subsistence" levels of ammo. I'm trying to run a heavy guns build but everything chews through rounds so fast I barely ever get to use them. One decent fight and I'm back to spending the next week farming ammo mats.
---
sure! 
---
On PC and they are never there for me either, I presume they have been moved to a vendor with all the other plans, have not found which one if that is the case.
---
I don't think griefing means what you think it means. &gt;_&gt;
---
What are  conduit pipes in Fallout 76 and how can I know more about them? I have too many wires all over my camp.
---
Your stash limit will say otherwise though, lol.
---
Yeah i read that earlier as it goes. Never check there either. I will be from now on though
---
You should try not to take criticism of a game so personally. It's not your game, you had no part in making it. It's understandable that you enjoy it, but the games flaws doesn't diminish the fun you had.
---
Don't take valid criticism of something totally unrelated to you as a personal attack mate.
---
Almost 300 hours in and I ran into my first violin over the weekend!
---
How would you know BSG is hard at work?  Maybe hard at work making the game worse?   Maybe they see this game as a huge failure and has pulled resources from it and only left one guy to fix this mess before they shut it down in a few month.  
---
PS4 
---
*Blueprints in C.A.M.P does not work.
---
You can not place the the build down regardless of how flat the land is. 
---
I should not have to resort to in-game trickery to make it work. Please fix this. 
---
*Getting reeeeal tired of fast traveling to my camp and getting stuck in rocks or the mountain. Please fix this, or put a fast travel mat in the game that only works for your camo site.  Again, its just frustrating to having to resort to trickery to make it work.
---
* the enemy verses weapons balance.
---
Why in the  entire hell do I have to empty an entire magazine of explosive two shot just to take down a rad-roach, or a radiated Dog?
---
* Make Power armor useful again, as hard as it is to aquire, it should be more useful. 
---
* can we put some sort of player can not sell tag on items we choose so we don't  accidentally sell out beloved weapons and armor when the game lags or freezes in the middle of using the robot vendors? 
---
Same boat, never had any fancy pants legendaries until around lvl 100 and even then its a two shot gauss rifle. What I find extra amusing is that even without a TSE the game is still pretty easy (as a rifleman or melee anyway.)
---
[They have!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cbortvX4lbLW2iX0OFPHf8cdjUUQINDWDoYWiHL-080/edit) Not sure about this bunker or whatever, but:
---
&gt; The game has data entries for Alien, Alien Captain, Alien Lieutenant and Alien Star Admiral which are increasingly difficult variants, these have the Zetan model and sound assets from Fallout 4.
---
There's also an Alien Blaster plan and mods for it but they're marked for post-release.
---
Interesting.

Not a problem if 4 of your armor pieces redice weapon weights 20%
---
I think something that a lot of people miss is that it is really easy to level up in this game (just like other Fallout games). I didn't spend long enough in the 20-30 range to notice it being hard. Just do the following:
---
* Sleep often (for the Well Rested perk).
---
* Level-up weapons as soon as you can. If you main an odd-level weapon (5th, 15th, etc.) switch back and forth between an even level main (10th, 20th, etc.) until you hit level 45 or 50. The legendary buffs aren't generally that big of a deal, especially now, so don't worry about keeping legendaries until you hit 45/50.
---
* Cook everything you can cook, even if you just dump it afterwards. The XP bonus us really disproportionate. 
---
* Bulk all of your scrap, always, even if you just dump it afterwards. Make sure you keep plastic as a marked component for this reason. If you are an area where you can safely grab every piece of junk in sight, are near a workbench, and have lots of plastic... grab everything, scrap it, bulk it, then dump it.
---
* Rank up crafting perks early on, especially Super Duper. You'll never be short of stuff to get your measly 200 caps per faction with.
---
* The higher your intelligence, the faster you will level. If you have a low intelligence build, consider having a few extra points of intelligence at low levels and then moving those points after level 50. Also, look for intelligence boosting legendaries and consider popping a berry mentat before a session of bulking or cooking.
---
God forbid something in the game not be tedious.
---
Yup, now I just wait for the ghouls to come to me and one shot them one at a time with my grognaks, instead of having to jump in the air so I don't kill myself with my TSE. /s
---
You can also put on pacifist mode and don’t have to worry about any stray bullets.
---
Please redirect all upvotes to this hero among us. Had no idea that the mods and perks used entry point functions like you described. Thanks for the info, now I'm back to farming for that anti-armor .50 cal! See you in a week!
---
It's horse shit because it's not very good and the game wasn't designed for it. Which is why only 4-5% of players "participate". 
---
Oh Lord. I'm closer than I thought. I forgot that there are refrigerators with tablets built into them now! Diablo fridge edition coming soon!!
---
Ill pray for you console players. Ive heard horror stories from my PS4 and Xbox friends. I don't even complain to them about PC life in this game. 
---
i would like to add to that;
---
live players play the game.. they run into obvious bugs... at some point you might not even be able to proceed or something..
---
QA/QC and "smarter" live players know how this works,
---
i dont know the exact numbers but i my guess is that the duping bug got found within 5 minutes..
---
its basic stuff thats groing wrong and THAT is the problem (also, that some of thiss "basic stuff" has been wrong for several previous games based on this engine)
---
if you are a QC you arent just "playing" the game (well some of the team will have to go trough that obviously) they should be checking the stuff that matters,
---
oh you can accidently scrap your mods = QC
---
you can duplicate things by simply putting them in a box after stressing the server to a timeout. = QC!!!! (they know the heavy stress it causes, they know how this game works, they should have known this before they even went in pre-production.. its basic stuff and it either got silenced, or it never got tested at all..)
---
plans rarity make take extreme forms = live/beta test
---
you can clip walls when exiting power armor = QC
---
you can clip walls and use it to walk and jetpack your way right to the nuke button = live/beta test.
---
( this is way too specific for small QC team, but the root of the problem is in QC there.. and ofc they knew the clipping issues)
---
But wut bout ol’TeSsE?
---
yeah some people sell for cheap too. 
---
So you want Bethesda to personally give you back an item that you weren't supposed to have in the first place? Good luck with that lol
---
I've quit the game, got tired of empty promises and game breaking patches.   
---
And they killed my explosive shotgun. I loved just going around killing things.
---
That's what &gt;!Rose's syringer!&lt; is for.
---
Croquette mallet
---
Clown costume
---
smiley face mask
---
Vault tec leather armor
---
Camo hunting rifle
---
Camo combat armor
---
Santa T51b
---
Still have almost 2k atoms left
---
The PVP servers are going to be absolutely dead if they don't revamp this horrific pvp.
---
Fair enough, I suppose something more correct would be "incentive to play daily".  Once people break that habit the game becomes a ghost town between content drops.
---
&gt;Next server, got the death aura.
---
Is that the thing where one random enemy will just die for no apparent reason when you're approaching it? 
---
It's actually broken
---
GET ON THE AMMO HAMSTER WHEEL RIGHT NOW!!
---
No, because it will never happen.
---
I'm starting to think that having non-instanced loot at all in the world is just a bad decision. You get problems like this, and people having to server hop because good spots are farmed out. I mean I basically hoover all the junk in the world and sell it already, at least anything that's worth the time to sell.
---
Even if all the stash boxes linked back to the main one and it’s limit, being able to sort things in-world would really be nice. 
---
Just the ability to have a box that I can store specific armor types for quick usage would rock the world. 
---
No matter how they get people in, unless they are brought in with a 50+ babysitter, they will still run into the Savage Divide to follow the main quest and get shit on. Even the lower Ash Heap gets up to 40 long before the player does.
---
We all have the syndrome, to capture everything we find. fault of the other fallouts
---
 It was very bad for Bethesda to limit us. 
---
I feel like I'm going to need that bucket at some time or that glass jar 
---
S O O T H I N G  V O I C E
---
One shot = help
---
Two Shots = Safe Camp in the area
---
Three Shots = Nuka Cola served here
---
Four Shots + Drinks served here (One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor!)
---
Five Shots (at night only) = The Little West Virginia Happy Whore House Open For Business!
---
Multiple Shots = It's a Party!
---
They are a nightmare to work with. 
---
You will need a lot of time and patients to deal with them.
---
You will also still have some wires at the end of the day sadly. 
---
Are you on pc?
---
I could give you some information when online via chat sometime
---
You’re wrong.
---
I play windowed, game sound off and my own soundtrack.
---
I grew tired of their selection really fast.
---
How much of a scary badass do you have to be to make the critters run off a cliff rather than deal with you?
---
So my minigun is supposed to break after half of westtek and use 1000s of bullets?
---
You're thinking everyone uses over powered weapons.
---
Yeah let's gut what makes the game unique and give off that creepy-ass abandoned feel it has going for it just a few months after launch.
---
You are right. I wish we had more than 24 players per server, or at least some replacements once people log off. 
---
Pull double duty 
---
&gt; NOTHING should be able to tank a 50 cal. 
---
And no one should be able to magically have any gun they pick up have perfectly aligned and zeroed sights at any and every distance at the same time and for whatever the current conditions are while always holding it perfectly straight (as long as their sight doesn't have too much magnification of course). But they do 'cause this is an RPG FPS and not a hardcore milsim.
---
400 is a major stretch. You can do all in this game in like 60.
---
To be fair, that's a lot of gaming/entertainment for your money though...... what did a couple of hours in the cinema cost? 
---
OK, so I will add what I know to be factual at this point, I have been playing since The end of November, and have met several other people through Trading and questing that have become "Game Friends", we Team up, use XBL Party Chat, and have a great time playing together, cooperatively, and we do lots of Events, Blast Zones, Sharing, of weapons &amp; resources, etc...
---
One player in our group, was doing the vendor thing, buying &amp; selling stuff, with minimal profit, mostly as a service, and general style of game play. Others in the group were cheap selling or donating stuff to his little shop, which has left his character now unplayable with the new weight restriction, a problem I have as well, with a character I was setting up to use as a vendor character, not a major issue, as I can remedy the problem easily enough.
---
One of the players in our group has recently been banned after having picked up what was most certainly Duped items and then reporting it to Bethesda, who after minimal dialog, sent him the Ban notice, and then ceased to respond. I am relatively certain this player had no active role in duping, (why would he initiate contact with Bethesda support if he had?) but either way I'm not sure he would come back to the game if the ban is lifted.
---
Most of the trading I've done I this game has been with only a few players, and mostly involved armor that I was trying to get to complete my build, or trading of ammo, what I need for what I don't. I have stopped accepting random trade invites, as I have been accused of Duping or supporting Dupers on several occasions due to my nice collection of weapons, that other than one which I traded for a similar but better suited for my build one are all self looted though many hours of farming legendary enemies.
---
I have done some mass crafting (sort of, in batches) using collected resources to create high value vendor fodder, and crafting weapons to scrap for learning plans (38 Handmade rifles). Crafting Diluted Stimpaks, using Perks nets an average of 7 to one, from resources that are also easy to craft in large quantities using game perks, and ended up with thousands before I even realized how quickly they were adding up.
---
From all I know to be factual, and an idea based on everything else I've heard or read, I would say that my accounts are at high risk of being banned (erroneously) though I have done nothing to warrant such action, and since I own 2 licenses, and multiple accounts, I would initiate legal action should this occur. But even without such problems, I am currently left to play as a Lone Wanderer most of the time, as all my friends are fed up with Bethesda, and playing other games now.
---
Im getting there now and I can feel the fire dying. Glad I have friends to keep the fire alive.
---
 Do the events and kill stuff with stars. It don't take long.
---
One of the conduit pieces looks like a lamp post, sort of. It bends on the top and bottom and has a wire connector in the middle. That's the piece that can be placed through a wall.
---
You can attach other conduit pieces to the top and bottom bendy parts.
---
Yup, happened to me two nights ago. Game said go and pick up the supply. Followed the orange smoke and lockpicked the drop, became wanted. Travelled to my camp, dropped my junk, travelled to Vault 76, waited a while until a nice stranger fast travelled to me and took off my bounty. Fast travelled back to my previous event, the event ended. So wasted my caps and some nice random’s caps, all for nothing.
---
Eh, that's kind of the point. The really valuable stuff should require some work and time to attain.
---
Now, I'd support making it free to fast travel between train stations. I feel like it's silly to waste caps jumping all around.
---
Depends on your perk cards I'd think
---
Yes,  ut at least in my case, ALL nearby enemies just fall over dead.
---
This is still way less annoying then FO4 survival.  As for junk and consumables you shouldn't have issue if your doing more then nuke zones.  
---
If you could say what else than executioner is on it it will be easier to answer.
---
I'd like to see your build then, because my stealth/sniper build ***used to*** work well, but now it obviously sucks.
---
Oof. Just saw you were on PS4. Must’ve not payed attention when I sent that. If you were on Xbox I could’ve got you one. 
---
I got alien blaster mod (i think it was plan) from sorchedbeast (I think it was queen) guano pile
---
You don't understand how databases work.
---
Don't "defend" yourself against level 68s yet. Just run and server hop if you have to. Or just explore the west of the map like mentioned.
---
So you raced through content and then complain about having raced through content?
---
Yeah, and good stuff like calibrated shocks is 6800 caps with hard bargain. I'm currently trying to save that up, but it's a solid week of grinding caps and I honestly have trouble coming up with enough stuff to even max all the vendors out once a day.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure lorewise the Assault rifles, the ones with the big round drum 'barrels' were specifically designed as heavy rifles for Power Armor use.
---
Smart Stove compatible
---
^^^all day!!! It really seems like the only way to make ppl happy at this point
---
Yeah, I gotta check once I get home, I don't remember 
---
You are the reason you suck
---
I have the most random item that I know I don't need and be like I don't wanna drop it and just eat a bunch of food...such a waste
---
Okay good I thought it was just me. I spent a whole day working on mine and simply couldn’t get it working.
---
Unfortunately I’m on the PS4!
---
If so i hope i see five shots being fired quite often lmao
---
Forgive them for what? Churning out a partially finished product that people bought anyway?
---
Fallout 76 was the last game I will ever buy from Bethesda, it confirmed just how bad their track-record is.
---
sorry, im talking about fans, not tourists. i did not collect data from people who only played for such a small amount of time. 
---
Why thank you!  I didn't notice that until you had pointed it out to me.   (Is there a notice somewhere about it...  I might have been oblivious.)
---
I dont think you actually « understand »
---
I had one Lv. 50 Legendary die as soon as it spawned, the others did not.
---
I'm not here to excuse any of the choices Bethesda's made, I'm just here to tell you how you can easily solve most of your listed issues.
---
Ballistic scrap is a bitch, and unfortunately the best thing to do about that is to loot military bases; Whitesprings Bunker, if you have access, also has a seemingly higher chance to spawn military grade duct tape in containers, or you can at least check the guard shack out front of it, and there are two dedicated spawns for it in a shack on a ridge east of the Crashed Space Station.
---
It's about 350-500 caps for a bundle of ballistic fiber - frankly if you can't get that much in an hour you're just not trying - but a good way to farm caps is to go to vendors that aren't player hotspots such as R&amp;G Station, Welch, or the Morgantown Airport vendor and just sell the weapons you get off enemies, or don't scrap stuff you don't need and sell it for a few caps, or bundle everything and sell that.
---
The Forest is a good place to farm 308, 38, 45, and 44 ammo, and Ash Heap is great for shotgun shells and 308; use melee weapons instead of guns until you build up a supply. You can also set your CAMP by a lead resource and then you've got the hardest part of resource gathering done.
---
If it's taking you 4 hits to kill a level 5 supermutant your weapons are absolute trash. A level 10 hunting rifle one shots them without perks. A level 5 shotgun kills them in 2-3 hits. A level 5 pipe revolver should be relevant up to level 15 enemies. Get better weapons. Craft them if you have to.
---
Fusion cores aren't an issue if you keep an eye out, or claim a power plant workshop once a week for an hour or two. I assume at your level you've gone through the Fire Breathers portion of the main quest, so you've already passed by and/or through several locations you can loot a core from - Silva Homestead, Morgantown Trainyard, Wade Airport, Belching Betty, Beckley, Mount Blair Trainyard, Mount Blair, Grafton Dam, Arktos Pharma, Black Bear Lodge, Kanawha Nuka Cola Plant, Poseidon Energy Plant, WV Lumber Co, Garrahan and Hornwright Mining Headquarters, Point Pleasant, Clarksburg, Camden Park, the Relay Tower north of Flatwoods, and AMR Medical all have either a loose core, a power armour spawn, or a generator.
---
I wreck peoples camps there either with TSE or orbital strike. I get a bounty then kill them repeatedly while sitting ON the roof of the clubhouse after they shoot me once. Killed one guy 5 times one day after I destroyed his 4 rocket turrets. Almost always net positive caps by doing this plus the pleasure of making these dbags rage quit the server.
---
But, but, but... you can use 4x as much ammo because it's a quad!
---
It's a bad habit of his.  He does it all the time.
---
Anthem looks interesting, hadn't heard of that, thanks for the heads up.
---
I dunno. My explosive shotgun (single shot) is still very, very good, even after the nerf. 
---
I love powerfists, but it stinks you can't wield them when in power armor.
---
you forgot the part where it despawned on kill or when it doesn't drop anything
---
 I will hunt that fucker not join him. He was harassing my present char from level 5 and killed him once. Now he's big and strong he just destroys him, several times if necessary. He can't hurt him anymore and seems to mainly stay away. Once in a while I'll go explode his monument and cook up his eggs, but only if I'm in the area.
---
Same here I had a total of 1000 pounds I finally dumped a lot of it and sold a lot of it now I’m at 556
---
I dunno, it took an hour to write, I thought it would take an hour to read!
---
Could you please look at the plans for deep pocketed armour chest and limbs. These used to be available from Grafton vendors but no longer show up now.
---
I think survival al will be the same game  it no restrictions on PVP and raiding. Still free to do the storyline if you choose but no actual content removed I do believe. And adventure will prob get some adjustments to go more pure pve I'd bet even tho BGS say they arent changing it.
---
True true, it’s just how it was in previous games
---
400+ hours isnt "raced through content" 
---
but thanks for trying, when i posted this i knew there would be at least one person who said something like this. 
---
Watoga can spawn a fair amount of legendarys
---
All hail the Mothman. All hail the holy LAMP! 
---
I keep running out of fusion cores.  My teammates still have some or they find them.  I need to spend more time around robots apparently.
---
Who said I only played for 60 you condescending piece of trash? 
---
I’m assuming we will eventually get the ability to display some things such as magazines, bobble heads etc. I collected Teddy Bears for a while but they are pretty easy to find again. Camden Park has a bunch. 
---
They literally explained it lol
---
I'm almost to level 60 and still haven't finished the Rose quests. Because guess what? I'm stuck at a part with high-level enemies, and have run myself totally out of stimpaks. Trying to farm them back sucks too, because you naturally end up needing to use a bunch in the process.
---
Look at the post they asked if it will go into the atom store lol
---
You are a god among men. May you continue to grind for god knows what reason, while we concede our inferiority and move on to games actually worth playing. Next time you're standing on top of a car or rock to cheese the AI, be proud of how much skill that requires. 
---
God I don't, 6-10 seems like the sweet spot.  Too many in one area typically ends up in sync issues and crashes for me on ps4.  It's really rare to see this many in a cell in a well.tuned game, and this isnt.
---
Conduits are good they take up more base space then wires and are somewhat easy to use now don’t get me started on getting neon lights aligned that’s a frustrating thing to do
---
And working at Burger Chef your whole career has made you an expert? It's amazing how many of you are these amazing computer experts.
---
Bagger 2 8 8 bagger 2 8 8
---
https://youtu.be/azEvfD4C6ow
---
Beelzebub himself now fears the bagger 2 8 8
---
I do this a lot. This shit is bugged as hell which explains 99% of conduits issues.
---
The musical instruments are neat. I’ve found a violin, guitar and banjo so far although I didn’t keep them because I didn’t realize how rare they are. 
---
Never thought about a coming expansion but I have no idea how they will make it. I don't care about PVE one single bit so I hope it's just new vaults or otyer areas to explore, and of course companions so I can get Curie back
---
No, no, you're good. That's the horse they rode in on. It's not dead, so keep kicking ;)
---
Get the hardened receiver. It will increase the handmade's damage.
---
It will routinely be super cheap but never completely free just to avoid the negative implications that come with F2P.  The ~~cash~~ atom shop is the monetization.  In that same vein, Bethesda will sell anything and everything they can in the atom shop while skirting around the negative implications of "Pay 2 Win".  We are already seeing them test the waters with the bonus health on the newest outfits when you are in a group.  The entire purpose of FO76 is to monetize the Fallout brand while they work on Starfield and Elder Scrolls for the next 5 years.
---
I prefer to leave a trail instead.  It makes it easier to find your way back.  It even works in the dark.... by any number of your senses.
---
How many caps
---
I have my tumblr blog on auto queue for 'Jason Mamoa running at Henry Cavill' memes
---
Get it at gamestop used for $10.
---
Also the ones that face down can be placed on a roof and go thro the roof
---
10 shots from a 50 dmg weapon with 50% armor penetration is the same as 5 shots from a 100 DMG weapon with 50% weapon dmg.
---
As far as I know armor penetration doesn't scale with higher dmg.........show me I'm wrong with some numbers.
---
I'm a level 55 and I claimed a workshop. Along comes a level 241 and literally one shots me. Crap like that makes the game not even worth playing anymore.
---
its not. But they have spoken about this, and you just have to wait. They are going to increase it. 
---
In the meantime, stop playing on autograb. Sheesh. 
---
Some of us rather enjoy our rad worms...especially with the Marsupial mutation.   Boingy boingy boingy....    
---
thats bullshit. the last two fallout games i played i had thousands of hours on. THOUSANDS. that was worth my money. this is not. its almost like there are bots/troll farms just WAITING for someone to post a negative post on reddit so they can post a comment like this... 
---
bethesda doing a little bit of damage control eh? trying to get the message to the consumers, eh? "ho ho, well at least you got your moneys worth, ho ho" 
---
keep that bot shit to yourself. 
---
Rude
---
unless i used to go for SBQ, when i saw 2 or more = alt f4 (restarting the game is somehow faster than back to menu here, not even surprised about it, probably a feature..)
---
right now, whenever i see a bethesda launcher i click uninstall.... 
---
(bethesda doesnt care if you dont play 3 days and spam reddit, UNINSTALL.. they can see the nrs dropping on install base.. hurts more than daily logins over the past week)
---
But yea been realising how little my TSE shotgun does myself and wondering what to do with it. Well we never know what nerfs and buffs will be introduced with time.
---
Throwing out insults instead of actually explaining why the database *doesn't* work the way I described really adds to your argument.
---
I got the plans, but if you want to the materials I can make it for you... Needs a lot of stable flux I believe. I have no budget left so not going to bother myself ..
---
Same deal
---
I got the plans, but if you want to get the materials I can make it for you... Needs a lot of stable flux I believe. I have no budget left so not going to bother myself ..
---
&gt; weapon/armor degradation happens at the same rate as it always has
---
Weapons? Yes and no. Like you said, it's because they made everything back into bullet sponges with the loss of TSE. Effectively, though, this is the same as saying weapons degrade faster. Armor absolutely degrades faster because of the White Knight nerf. Anyone I knew that avoided PA was very upset about this one.
---
I need to get an Alt and dump my caps on them... 
---
Same dude
---
I'd join but I'm already the general of the Enclave. :(
---
Go to germany and buy a used ps4 controller to get the game free. Best discount so far and if you miss it you are a noob.
---
Just the cake icon near your name and the date shown in your profile AFAIK 
---
Vertical. Do vertical words... horizontal is a nightmare,  makes conduit seem easy
---
This is the key reason, we are conditioned from other fallouts to grab everything, and it’s a hard habit to break. 600 isn’t enough for people like us. But it’s manageable if you cull regularly.
---
They’ve done npcs in Skyrim multiplayer so there’s no reason they can’t do it here
---
Lol yeah True griefing is something else I know
---
But people like this ruin the enjoyment of a game which is why I tend not to do MMOs but making an exception with FO76 as its easy ti keep to yourself - and for the most part it works
---
So when this happens, it can be as bad as true griefing 
---
Do they sell it cheaper in store than they list it online? I'm seeing used copies for ~34.99 there.
---
Nah, if the Super Bowl literally got nuked like in *Sum of All Fears* it would have still been less of a catastrophe than Fallout 76
---
The depths of hell do not even begin to describe how deep my hatred for the idea that the magazine determines armor penetration. ESPECIALLY in a game where you can craft ammunition. 
---
I think it's less a problem that the game itself is hard or tedious and more that certain builds or items just aren't viable, and if you want to use them it makes everything a lot harder. The game ends up funneling you into playing it a certain way. Like if you want to ignore strength and be like a pistol toting agile maniac you're going to have a hard time for sure, but that just makes a lot of people avoid playing that way. Like I never used leather armor in fallout 4 but that's what I used exclusively because it didnt take a million screws to build. I maxed out strength immediately when I kept it average every other fallout. The weight and scarcity of certain types of ammo makes you use only certain weapons as well. I mean I started using the hunting rifle as my primary just because there's 308 ammo out the ass and I quickly got every mod for it. 
---
well, if you look at my comment you can clearly see that i did not say that. any perceived insult is you projecting your own feelings. 
---
It's the RNG payout that really gets me about grinding lately. If you have to spend caps to travel to an event, you should be able to tell if the event is even viable or not. Now it's a total dice-roll.
---
Thanks for the tips. Will watch this video soon.
---
Do you think it’s best to start my base with just the foundation and then add the conduit infrastructure before putting in all my fun stuff?
---
Found the guy who bought sentinel armor lol
---
 Level 50 BOS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs. Amazing Armor and the one Arm regenerates.
---
 Level 45 Lever Action with a Long Barrel and Hardened Receiver, hits at 116 and the Sword of Bastet hitting at 135 with its own AP and 2 Levels of Incisor, so Armor Piercing. Ironclad and really nothing else much.
---
 I built all of it. I sell the Legendaries I pick up. ;)
---
I think Bethesda should have called this Fallout something other than Fallout 76. 76 is just a number like 4 or 5 so people make a connection to the other numbered Fallout games. I say this because of Fallout Shelter, no one expects Fallout Shelter to be Fallout only on mobile. The name makes its stand out from the others.
---
Elder Scrolls Online even works better. You don't expect Elder Scrolls Online: Morrowind to be the sequel to Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. 
---
Maybe even just Fallout Online would a have been better or Fallout Survive like Metal Gear Survive just to make it more clear that this is in the same universe but it can't be compared to Fallout 1-4.
---
Anyhow, rock and a hard place I guess.
---
To your point though I believe the game design decision for FO76 was no human NPCs and that won't change since that would go against one of the fundamental game designs. They may work around that by making the NPCs in a vault all Ghouls so you sort of have half-human NPCs. On the other hand who knows, maybe Bethesda makes a 180 because the game is going down well with players. For the record I am not fussed either way, to me the NPCs in Fallout and even Elder Scrolls were forgettable. 
---
I can honestly only recall a hand full of NPCs across all the Fallouts (1-4 &amp; NV) and Elder Scrolls (Oblivion &amp; Skyrim).
---
Same. But also I've become a god damn super mutant with all the mutations I have. 
---
I dunno man, I'm level 31 and dont have that sort of problem. I tend to be a loner with a hardened marksman bolt action sniper and a good ski sword. I have no problem taking down lvl5 mutants at all. 
---
To be fair, i somewhat enjoy grinding. I have to see progress to make it worth it though. 
---
Im sure our play styles are very different too
---
I love when people make a whine post and then cap it off with statements like " This game is broken at the design level and with each patch they break it even more."
---
It's like you started with a specific point and then smoked some crack and just decided to amp up the whine to shockingly new heights. xD
---
Survival mechanics are easy in this game. If you have to 'grind' to feed and hydrate yourself, I don't know what to say. You suck at this game, that's the only explanation. I literally place 4-5 plants in the ground for a bare minimum of budget use and throw my camp by a water source and I can easily feed and hydrate myself for an entire 6 hour session with 2 minutes and a rad away. 
---
I'd also point out that I don't think YOU know what a survival game is, because while 76 is most accurately a hybrid genre, the idea that a survival game = "shooting, looting, and having fun" is way, way off base. I mean yea, arguably all games should be about fun, but shooting and looting are \~typically\~ rare and taxing in some way in survival games, and typically that does require grind. 
---
So yea, I don't know what your issue is, because 'grind' is hardly how I'd define the low effort required to handle survival mechanics in this game. 
---
What system? 
---
There are aliens listed in the official strategy guide, but I believe they are cut content, like the exotic weapons perks.
---
Topkek
---
Yep, should be a level floor with the exception of who dropped the nuke.
---
This is a  super edgy post.
---
While it doesn’t work for the better one it still looks beautiful in my opinion

---
I have two issues
---
1. I can't lock my water purifiers
---
2. daily quests arent resetting. I did idle explosion daily quest last week on friday morning about 1 AM est. It is now monday 4: 09 pm.  Odly enough i also did buried with honor alittle after i completed idle explosion and i can no longer get it to start. 
---
&gt; People like me? 
---
Read his post a little more carefully.
---
People *like you to think*.  
---
He's not saying "People similar to you think..."  He's saying "People would prefer that you think..."
---
That’s fine. But the game shouldn’t give you a prompt asking you to pick up the supply. The game is baiting you into becoming a wanted.
---
Not to mention all the bobble heads and magazines I just can’t get rid of cause, damn it, I’d like to display those bad boys in my camp or at one point sell them to players if we ever get a vending machine type trading system.
---
They explained the hood, not the coat
---
I sadly lost my officer uniform,it looked awesome.
---
I made a post about this. It reminds me of the futurama episode 
---
Rustic Stash Box
---
Silver Shroud Costume
---
Black Pip Boy Paint
---
This is like the opposite of science. Also $60/450 hours is 13 cents an hour for entertainment. If you got 450 hours of entertainment out of something and you're dissatisfied, I think you need to really reflect on what dissatisfaction is.
---
This is exactly why it is a pain in the ass to use anything except melee.  Guns should be viable without perks.  Perks should make them better, but they should work well from the get-go.
---
Nothing right now.
---
Haven’t played more than a few minutes in over a week.
---
I want to do another run through with a pistol VATS luck build like I did in Fallout 4 and enjoyed a lot.
---
I’m done with my current character though even though I haven’t progressed the main story very far (I have the scorch vaccine and that’s it).
---
There is no replay value to the story, no choices, no consequences, just a single linear story where you have to stop the big bad who is a mindless evil killer.  No nuance.
---
1. get the perks that improve ammo findings
---
2. get the perks that reduce weapons breaking
---
3. don't rely on one or two weapons, that's kind of how survival hybrids work
---
4. find and trade ammo with others
---
Problem solved tbh. 
---
At 600 pounds what’s needed next is an easy way to sell off legendaries to other players IMO and a larger stash just slightly delays the inevitable 
---
Make sure you're locking them, too.  If people see your purifiers, they WILL take your water.  
---
I have several, keep half locked.
---
They could just add an armor penetration system thats a bit more verbose. For example, making certain calibre sizes have more penetration and damage while giving recievers a flat penetration rating. 
---
Example: 
---
.45 reciever = 50 damage + 10 flat pen ( base ammo always ignores 10 armor despite % penetration)  
---
So with tank killer,  it would like  (50 damage +36% armor pen) + 10 flat pen.  
---
.50 cal = 80 damage + 30 flat pen
---
Note: these numbers are random
---
Flat penetration is important for auto builds. If you add customizable ammo then you can chose either more flat penetration or % penetration. The decision would be based on what your fighting, but it would make crappy guns like the minigun a bit more tolerable. And it would make the game less of  bullet sponge simulator. 
---
Individual rounds can be customized with hollow point, fmj, ect to increase pen values and help things die faster. 
---
Damn, I just said this.  I shoulda read ahead!
---
Well, the melee player gets rushed as well. When I'm running a rifleman build and I get rushed by a mob, I start backtracking while simultaneously firing at the mob, prioritizing the closest ones to keep the distance between myself and the baddies as great as possible. With melee even backtracking requires the enemies to be close to land a hit. I'm not sure if there's a perk for reducing damage taken from melee or not; I do know there are several aimed at reducing taking damage in general that would apply to any build.
---
I was mostly mentioning the assets but I didn't know their were actually any other alien type things outside of the blaster that you find in the water and the mission to get the ammo. 
---
I think you have played too much already, you think all posters that don't agree are synths :-)
---
Mods available:  I currently have 15 receiver, 8 barrels, 7 grips, 7 magazines,  8 sights, and 5 muzzles.  Learned them by lots of building and scrapping, many springs.
---
Current fave: Powerful Auto Receiver, Aligned Long Barrel, True Stock, Drum Mag, Reflex Sight, and Suppressor.   With Commando perks for 30%, 3 Tank Killer, and 3 Tormentor (important), it handles anything including the SBQ.
---
Lots other combinations are great, depends on build and other weapons. The perforating mag might be better for some situations; might try it sometime but busy with alt builds. A scope is nice for range and crits, but using the reflex for quick ADS with charging enemies and SBQ parties.
---
I have Powersmith equipped and at a 3. It was the first thing i double checked. 
---
Maybe make it so that every 2 hours the vendors restock 100 caps and can restock to 500 stored caps each until they use that 500 caps or lower it to 400 they can’t get anymore till then. That way there’s no daily cap and they ain’t out right flooding the market with caps rewarding playing longer at the same time giving you something to work for when you log in the next day.
---
I use the lever action rifle with a suppressor works just fine.  I sneak to a spot spot and just start popping off heads.
---
Build and scrap for mods and pray you find a good legendary with anti armour.
---
Suppressors are useless now stealth is broken so don’t worry about that or stealth perks.
---
I still prefer semi auto as opposed to full auto.
---
Swing and a miss
---
There are a lot of little things they could do to spice it up and keep it playable:
---
**Normal AWOL Armaments** \- Hard but doable both solo and in a group. Some chance for death. Crappy rewards.
---
**SUPER AWOL Armaments** (spawns 1 out of 4 times AWOL would come up) - Quadruple the enemy health, double the enemy damage, make it 6 waves instead of 3. Give BETTER 3 STAR GUARANTEED REWARDS and chances at rare plans. You'd have to be high level, bring a group, and even then it would be a tough fight. 10-30 stimpacks later / broken weapons / broken armor, you'd get some nice rewards, and feel justified that you should go farm stimpacks and materials again to make sure you can do it the next time it's up.
---
It should take ONE of your coders a WEEK tops to put this in. It's not changing anything in the event except some variables (health, damage, number of waves, rewards). If they couldn't do that in a week, it's not the coder that's the problem, it's the engine.
---
Easy fast content. It doesn't need to be completely new systems in the game. Find a few content things you can implement in each patch. Metal Wall Powered Doors (so my metal base doesn't look weird). A new random encounter thing (a bunch of skeletons in a circle with a reference to Fight Club). A new event which is basically an old event but scaled up in difficulty. A few new small things in each patch make a BIG difference to player happiness :)
---
Everyone being swimming in caps within hours would be just as tedious.  It would basically turn any meaning the economy may have had left, into just another number that occasionally gets in the way for a short while.
---
Since that twat doesn't want to be remotely helpful...
---
It's a rare outfit you can get from completing specific events. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1av-wwg2_dc) explains how to get them.
---
You can put it anywhere.......kind of.  Most things have to snap to foundation but nit foundation
---
Oh no! You guys don't take super mutants either? *facepalm*
---
I miss bright blue because it acted light white when using the flashlight but wasn’t as boring as white when looking at pipboy
---
&gt; Doesn't this just suck the fun out of the game? 
---
Nah, it made it way more fun.  Killing something with one explosive blast is a lot more fun than pumping round after round into something while it damages your armor, your gun condition goes down, and then you have to farm for ammo again.  The game becomes more of a grind now.
---
Tbh heavy weapons dont really kill. They cripple and stagger better then anything else though. 
---
Still laughing at the Downvotes
---
 consensus has shifted these days hasn’t it 
---
As many criticisms I have for some aspects of the game, when I sit down and play it I get lost in the world. It doesn't matter if I'm at Vault 76 shooting some Liberators, at the Moonshiners hut shooting some ticks to make some stimpacks, wandering here or there. I like the game. I could get lost in it for hours if I wanted to. I'm just taking a break right now and see what happens. Log in now and then to check the atomic shop. Maybe sell 200 caps worth to a vendor while I'm there. Maybe give a low level a care package then log out.
---
Yeah me too actually feels like the first real quest in the game, was a lot of fun. A lot of the robots just ignored me and didn't even shoot .. I recommend doing the nuke solo to anyone if you confident enough, I didn't find any of the robots over threatening, more annoying. 3 assaultrons were probably the biggest threat ..
---
Not everyone who enjoyed using the TSE falls into that category.  Hell, I'm Level 131 and haven't even launched my first nuke yet.  I miss my god weapons.
---
I've only found Marine armor plans in the wild.  Usually in the BoS areas in South Mire / Cranberry Bog.
---
Am I the only one seeing the irony of the free states requiring the union army uniform?
---
Hmm. I may have to quit gaming and focus all my efforts in cooking TO FARM THAT SWEET DIABLO LOOT! WHAT IS HAPPEN TO THIS WORLD?! I QUIT!! GOING HOME! NOOOPE! lmao
---
I found the trick to get them to work tho it’s annoying but they look nice
---
It is funny but I like the look of the uniform and it's easy to get so can't beat that
---
Yes.  Before the patch I found BoS and Deep Pocketed mods for Combat Armor in Grafton and Welch.
---
Post patch though, haven't seen them on any vendor.
---
I can believe that, somebody has to be so might as well as be you. But no one suicidal is going to be effected by nazi swastika drawn inside a videogame.
---
I’ve taken the tips on this site and avoided energy weapons like the plague.  Shotguns and melee and the occasional 50 cal or grenade launcher for me.  Also have two legendary fat mans.  2 shot gauss for when a SB shows up 
---
My go to weapon is.. a stealth combat knife . Im lvl 40 and sneak kill everything with 1 or 2 stabs, mobs of enemies included. Im lvl 41 and the escape artist card is invaluable. My second weapon is a supressed handmade for some sticky situations. Also i never use power armour and have barbarian and white knight maxed so of my armour rarely breaks.
---
If you know how to work the perk cards then i dont see why people are finding this game hard. Also if you know where to look finding resources isnt tedious. Theres videos all over youtube of the best places to find specific junk ie desk fans. After all this game has always been anf always will be about SURVIVING  in the wasteland. 
---
Im just pissed i cant scrap ammo or sell it.
---
Another bug ig
---
You on Xbox? Join me. Maybe I'm lucky. I have only had one person kill me and I kind of asked for it. I had the workshop in the top right corner and was feeling Ammo. I guess someone had the same idea and didn't want to hop servers so the level 178 took my little level 23 ass out with one shot. &lt;_&lt;
---
You raise a good point about the Incisor perk ignoring 75% of armor. A lot of perks seem to have equivalents for other builds, but I really can't think of anything gun-oriented that ignores quite that much armor.
---
I DC all the time, I quit the game app all the time and yet to have lost anything significant, it's pretty good at saving. I am surprised you lost stuff while building ..
---
Game isn't for everyone, I still enjoy it . the max weight is my biggest frustration at the moment, I can live with the rest ..
---
As one of three people trying to use Syringers, I found an issue with them. After firing, the reload animation time blocks other weapons from being used.
---
Steps:
---
* Fire Syringer
---
* Quick swap to another weapon (faster weapons show this better)
---
* Try to fire or swing the melee weapon
---
Weapons I used was a Syringer on hotkey 1 and a 10mm automatic on hotkey 2.
---
Until the full duration of the Syringer reload is completed, you can't use the swapped weapon. And because you swapped away from the Syringer, it is still unloaded when you switch back.
---
The increased grind, various nerfs, and lack of content has led me to delete the game from my library entirely. 
---
OP, only one of your sentences is missing the word Mothman. You are such a phony. I bet you've never even seen Mothman you noobert. 
---
Nope me neither..
---
If this post has more upvotes than the video has likes that's shameful. Give both credit 
---
If you're taking about Enclave, they have spares in the bunker.
---
Hey, you do you my man.
---
In case you are unaware, you can get a union kepi hat from a small cemetery on a hilltop just south of the pumpkin house.
---
Hahahahhaahhahahahahha.
---
May as well use a trebuchet 
---
I'm super late on this but this is what comes up first when you google this problem so more people might see it, i just had to unplug my controller an launch the game again and it was fixed.
---
If you're stealthy enough, no running is needed.
---
They traded RNG time sink for CAPS time sink.  Neither one really makes people happy.
---
I'd love to see vendor caps limits increased, or refresh faster, or something.
---
Any idea if they have warehouse plans? 
---
I feel like they are trying but they’ve never done something like this and didn’t think far ahead enough. But I’m enjoying the game, even if I’m two months late. 
---
Also it doesn't matter if you can acheive the same DPS target even in practice if the fire rate is so high that you just end up running out of bullets all the time. Then there's just no reason not to go for ammo efficiency if there's not some other trade off.
---
Is that pre or post patch 5 (known plans)?
---
I sever hopped before last patch 36 times and never saw them (thats not including the hundreds of times I looked before I kept track). On the other hand, (for me) there was a 66% chance of ultralight marine limbs and chest at either place, and at least a 58% chance for the radium rifle at watoga station, many times that was the only thing available
---
I’ve gone at level 35 and broke out my melee weapon and started hitting mobs on top of the bunker.  I’ve gone inside to heal and hit them from the door.  On same battle I ran out with my sledgehammer and started hitting the Queen on her back legs when she landed.
---
I healed people that went down and did what I could to contribute.
---
Leeching is not cool.  You show up, you make an effort to contribute as best you can.
---
On the other hand, all the farming spots would constantly be picked bare. 
---
As a melee build I have no issue - but when I try out a rifle build the difference is night and day. I can one shot things with my super sledge without effort and have to hit something with my nerfed TSE lever action 3-5 times. I'm avoiding the SBQ at this point. I think ranged weapons in general need a damage buff in general if bullet sponge end game bosses are going to be the norm.
---
Build and scrap. Get the hardened receiver. With rifleman perks I do 103 a shot with a standard lv 45. Add in tank killer perk for armor piercing, as well as one of the armor piercing magazines and you will chew up most of the harder baddies. With sneak attach I one shot basically anything level 50 or below.
---
Armorsmith perk + Super Duper keeps the ammo bill low. 
---
I have zero problems taking how hordes of super mutants or even scorched beasts with it. Armor piercing is a really important key feature that gets overlooked when people are striving to run up damage numbers. get that armor piercing rate as high as you can, any bad guy you face of note has high ballistic defense. 
---
Lv 68 super mutants are all a 3-5 shot kills depending on shot placement. 
---
Swarm of suitors suffers from bad design overall. You have some little time to kill the mirelurks, but if they take so too long to come or spawn you will fail it if you are on the island. Dropped this one after first few fails solo. 
---
I use leather armour for the dense chest mod 
---
My dream is for a [Blackreach](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blackreach)-scale [Rockopolis](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rockopolis). It could even be a way to introduce playable ghouls with an alternate starting point. 
---
I'm kind of holding my breath for the 2nd DLC though. The first DLC is usually a small one, and it might reflect how they thought the game was going to be played prior to the beta. It could just be a vault Monster Mash or something.
---
I wouldn't mind grinding but the whole 200 cap limit makes it so fucking pointless.
---
right but your argument doesnt take into account the previous titles, which by your math were... $0.0085/hr... so.... thats a criminal increase. i cant think of a single argument for moving a decimal point 3 numbers over. im pretty sure thats the plot of office space... 
---
lets say you sell paper products. you sell your rolls of paper by the sheet. each roll has 750 sheets. you sell this roll for $60. you do very very well, and pretty soon everyone is coming to you to buy this paper. you now change your setup, and you now only sell .75 sheets of paper for $60. you then tell your customers "yeah, well you got your moneys worth"....
---
. 
---
this is your argument, broken down and used for something different. do you understand how absurd it is? 
---
[found this one on new egg. Xbox One, digital copy, $20. though it looks like its sold by a third party. don't know if that matters](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA6V68KM5804&amp;Description=fallout%2076&amp;cm_re=fallout_76-_-9SIA6V68KM5804-_-Product)
---
Its not enough. Hopefully a bump up to at least 750 comes soon.
---
We'll make the whole fight in the nuke, and train enemy mobs on them and don't revive them. In a team with rad sponge and goulish shared it's very easy.
---
It's most likely holiday overstock. Rather than return it and take the hit for storing all that unsold stock, just give it away with other things. 
---
What gets me is that this doesn't necessarily mean the game sold poorly, but that the market in that particular area wasn't right for that many copies. I know the game didn't sell nearly as well sell as other BGS games, but people act like it just means that the game didn't sell at all (not saying you did, but a lot of people are).
---
Same. I saw no sense in continuing with the tedium as it stands. When all I was doing was going from spot to spot hoping to find screws or looking in industrial areas for crafting benches (with no luck) only to find them in some bootleggers shack...
---
I will reinstall someday. But for now I’m going back to Bethesda labeled games that work. 
---
That's a lot of time for a game that is out for less than a 100 days. 
---
As stated above, you might want to set it as a threshold thing, otherwise ALMOST breaking it then walking away becomes a thing and costs people to rebuild.
---
Level 59 and I've not seen a single piece with that bonus, FWIW
---
I am assuming by .50 cal rifle you mean the hunting rifle chambered for .50. But the .50 cal machine gun is way heavier. The real life equivalent weighs in at 84 lbs. You don't walk any where with that thing. It is always mounted. Either on a vehicle or a tripod. The current rifle issued is the M4. It weighs 8 lbs with a 30 round mag attached. The M9 pistol is about 2 lbs with its 14 round mag. But ammo is much heavier in real life. 100 rounds of .50 is 35 lbs.
---
Only bit of feedback I'll give is that your levels need to be raised but otherwise love the content. Hope you continue to make more :)
---
Yes it's 34.99 not 10
---
Thanks I didn't know that
---
Try prison and high school cafeterias for TV dinner trays
---
Ski poles use to be a good provider, I think they got nerfed though. Tv dinner trays are a good provider, lots around if you keep your eye out.
---
I managed to start with 14 minutes yesterday. So I finally got to summon the friendly mothman after countless failures.
---
Thanks that's great!
---
Best guy ever. It's fun hanging out with him and just walking around. 
---
Yeah that sucks. Energy, Explosive, and heavy need buffs. OP thinks everyone uses handmade and shotguns.
---
You just reminded me about how annoying the added tome of constantly swapping situational perk cards has become.
---
I can't go 2 minutes without opening my pipboy.
---
Same here. Came after the first way of Morgantown nuke. Plenty of glowing ghouls, not a single legendary. not worth it. 
---
"The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment ..."
---
Oh even the housing has a limit? 
---
Very cool, glad there is a way.
---
&gt; reward that requires me to actually participant in this challenge
---
This is my main gripe with nuke silos. I suffer through it for 45 minutes (because I like to let the turrets soften things up for me), and then everyone floods in and gets their loot at the nuke zone, while I get a minigun or missile launcher and some armor for doing the silo.
---
Yup, I’ll definitely spend an entire day following him around, even mark what pattern he travels in.
---
Oh maybe I'll run into you then :) 
---
Just watched the guide - thank you.
---
Going to do a complete tear down of my camp now hahaha.. wish me luck. 
---
Braxtons Quality Medical Supplies is by far the easiest and best place to farm bones.  Its a skeleton making factory, lmao.  It is east of DYER CHEMICAL and does not have an icon on the map so its easy to miss.  Its just tables and tables of free bones for the picking, more than you will ever need.
---
I'll probably do that !!
---
100%.
---
i don't have anything to say to the idiot that complains that the game sucks after putting 400+ hours into it.
---
They explain that ghouls are seemingly immune. At least from what I learned. 
---
Yes, so we could get a real reward killing the queen.
---
finally something useful to the rebuilding of america.
---
Psst .308 it.
---
Last time they did an MOG, they had worked with ZOS, but now they're working on their own and it is brand new to them. It's amazing work for a first attempt, but it needs a new engine to cope with object quantity. 
---
Tbh Energy Rifles are the strongest pvp weapon at the moment due to how potent they can stagger Sentinal/Cavalier users when you have the Splitter mod on them. 
---
Most heavy weapons i have still shred through my enemies... but im at endgame. Like Adrenaline Reaction mutation makes all weapons viable by doubling the damage. 
---
Cool, though I had it my head they were plastic?
---
I dusted 4 off to get my fix as I never did get all of the trophies. Then I have AC Origins and Odyssey to tackle. I'm hoping by the time I've finished those 76 will have matured enough for another go.
---
I'm going to take a look; I honestly don't have anything better to do today.
---
8-10
---
Your story is kinda weird.  The guy apparently stands still and doesn't try to fight you in the process, you kill him multiple times, and then he friendly wants to trade with you.  
---
idk. Try equipping one of the new ones or the final mistress of mysteries dress and checking active effects?
---
I tell you people over and over and over.
---
You need to stack armors that reduce weapon weights by 20%
---
Then you can carry an absolute arsenal and dont have to stash em.
---
&gt;Nah, it made it way more fun.  Killing something with one explosive blast
---
Ain't going to argue against that logic. Explosive blasts are always a *blast*.
---
Nah. I want harder. Challenge me, Bethesda. I dare ye.
---
I’ve come across the vendor in Charleston station by the pond without server hopping. Just went to check as near by. And he had the coat xD 
---
What’s so special about it that it cost 900 caps?
---
Also what’s so special about the trader ?
---
I think it's both, I mean even after the resource nerds I'm still constantly scrapping n bulking junk to no end and ditch stuff regularly to make space to do it again. I jus need someone to shoot at me n make it fun again lol. And yes I think BGS had to slow us down a bit to keep us busy longer for more time as you said
---
Grahm*
---
I have noticed more dead vault dwellers recently and don’t remember seeing them before the last patch.
---
Frank Horrigan will.
---
It's basically on top of hopewell cave.
---
Interesting. I'm not convinced that this bunker exists, but this is certainly a mark in its favor.
---
Watoga. 
---
nah, bethesda legitimately has a team of people in an office who are paid to react to the criticism on social media... which is something pretty much every large corporation is doing right now. 
---
You really live up to your username and faction. 
---
You won this time.
---
FO76 has just proven the Bethesda don't know how to do online. They should hand the game off to ZOS. At least they might be able to salvage it. I had real high hopes for this game too.
---
They're even listed in the strategy guide, but even that has content that is not available (like it also mentions winterized T51 power armor paint).
---
Only thing more terrifying is Frank Horrigan.
---
Weapon degradation is to fast. I understood it in other the other Fallouts because everything is over 300 years old. Here stuff is around 30 or newer since you can make your own weapons. A good pistol should be able to shoot well over 3000 rounds before needing to change the barrel.
---
If i knew this was gonna get this much attention I would have told the guy to post it
---
My mini guns shreds, but breaks in a few minutes and eats up all my ammo.  My rifle does it faster and far more efficiently. It's mostly a pve game and they said they are buffing energy and heavy so I hope sooner than later.
---
Gonna piggyback on this to offer a few more *hotspots*
---
- Grafton HS has a closet with like 30 balls. I haven't found a better spot for rubber
---
- Morgantown HS and the nearby cat herder house near Bolton Greens gets me about 150 plastic per run
---
- Tree Tops has a ton of leather and a decent amount of lead and plastic
---
- Camden Park is great for lead and steel from all the can traps
---
- The office building in Bog Town has tons of typewriters and globes and shit on the top floor of the big building. The roof next door is decent for fertilizer too.
---
I some how still at near full stash and I make sure to only keep 50 and below of stuff I do t use often and 200 of what I do, (springs, screws, nuke waste)
---
yeah never lost a thing plus rarely ever DC anymore. Lies.

I stopped playing around the APC wall glitch because they just couldn't get ANY handle on griefers using gear that was literally supposed to be locked out for days. Went into the pvp zone and would die from 2 smg bullets, no thanks. Never went back, especially after using all of my materials to try and craft weapons only to have them UP the fucking cost because of  people using the gltich. Their idea of 'fixing' the problem was make everything cost more so if you didn't originally glitch you were screwed. 
---
Thanks! 
---
Though honestly, at the rate PA is using Cores, I dont know that  I care. Using Power Armor exclusively at this point is probably just a Fusion Core farming sim.
---
Though to be honest, I like the idea of very limited Power Armor. It means we dont end up with a game balanced around walking tanks above level 25. 
---
Try a build you’ve never done before.
---
Most likely it won’t be very viable because Bethesda...fucked everything up...but it might be fun.
---
I almost always go stealth sniper build but in FO4 did a non stealth pistol build I liked.
---
Also a shotgun build centered around my never ending double barrel shotgun which was great too...so a quad double barrel would be fun in 76.
---
But that's his point. This issue was there with or without TSE, but now since TSE can't make shit weapons decent we might have real hopes of fixing the shit classes.
---
Would hold my breath for the minigun, unless they will do a different approach to weapon tiers, cause gatling laser is the higher tier gatling weapon when comparing the two since they became a thing. 
---
hey buddy, i havent played fo76 in over a month, i dont play that shit anymore.... all my data is from OTHER PLAYERS. you can hate on my findings as much as you want, but once you hit 400 hours deep youre gonna have a bad time.  the numbers hold up.

He is the shining light in this game. I always say that when i find him

Enemy Damage Resistance has got to be lowered. Or even removed. Imagine if you hard capped Damage Resistance. Be much easier to balance around. 
---
Cafeteria trays are plastic, tv trays are aluminium.
---
Yeah this game needs work.

I bought a ☆☆☆ grog axe w/ 40% swing speed + dmg buff per consecutive strike for dirt cheap from quarter master bot. I'm 100% sure it was an accidental sale. rip to the poor soul.
---
Agreed, I sort of wonder if the nerfs that make frustrating things even more frustrating could be to pave the way for paid fixes. Like, if they really wanted White Knight to be less as less an essential pick like they said, they could easily have just increased armor durability. Nerfing it doesn't make it less compulsory for those not in PA, they just made it suck more. Perhaps there will be non-degrading armor sold, or premium perk cards?
---
Also, though I seem to be the only one bringing it up, there was recently a huge increase in container respawn times. Crossed my mind that it could be to pave the way for selling something, like paid survival packs?
---
i have \~4000 on my 3 alts.

Luckily I DC'ed from this whine fest

There are responder terminals taking about their lack of doctors, with one having left to join the BOS. In the holotape, she describes her shock induced anxiety, and outlines a management strategy, both clearly informed by medical training. She does the same thing at the end describing treatment for trigger finger, stiff tendons from several days of dehydration &amp; starvation, as she wills herself to pull the trigger.
---
The Journal entry in AMS mentions her fear of enclosed spaces and that kind of brutal irony is Bethesda's bread and butter. I'm not trying to engage in unfounded Derridean deconstructionism, it just seemed pretty clear. Could be wrong. But I think I'm right
---
They broke the red tactical in a recent patch. Expect it to get fixed in an upcoming patch.
---
Okay, let's assume for a moment that this isn't utter BS (a bit of a stretch, but what the hell, I like a good wild goose chase) We have the clues "colorful forest", "unmarked body of water with a tree in the middle", and "near a factory". There was also a second post saying "middle of the map". That would mean we're looking for a small pond in the vicinity of either Mama Dolce's or Arktos Pharma. It can't take too long to search those two locations.
---
is it Heavy....black....and pendulous? /RHPS
---
This would work if it was worth it. Gatling gun murders stuff without stagger or cripple, has high durability and ammo consumption is low between enemies.
---
Minigun/gatling laser/gatling plasma are opposite of that in every way sadly. 
---
Also, /u/BethesdaGameStudios_, another idea that would add decor while *also* freeing up stash space and possibly reducing server load:
---
Just a quick idea for a way to free up some stash space without having to tweak databases, modify the inventory code, or do any kind of deep modifications. Add a "Pallet" item for each kind of scrapped junk that is a placable item for your C.A.M.P. that costs 100 of its material and, when scrapped, gives 100 back. Make it the size and shape of a pallet, stackable on itself, and (to deter griefers) make it able to be repaired for 1 of its material or some wood rather than a percent of the construction cost.
---
Then we can store as much scrap as we can fit in our bases, it would add a level of verisimilitude in that we can physically see the tons of material we have laying around, and it would free up stash space and server load at the same time.
---
On top of that, I would love to be able to make a warehouse section of my camp and stack pallets up in there because it kinda feels like it should be more apparent that I've got way more steel than any sane person should be carrying.
---
yeah im sure flamekid456's post about how he loves the game is jimmy up in corporate.
---
I just did the glassed cavern this AM, three scorchbeasts going in, mirelurk kings, scorched, and scorchbeasts in the cave... when I left, Scorched Earth was going on at the prime fissue, so I helped take out the scorchbeast queen, some scorched mirelurk queens, more Sierra Bravos... and after all of that I get killed by a batch of cave crickets outside the watoga high school because for whatever reason VATS shows 95% but my shots do no damage.  Frickin' CRICKETS!
---
I never considered using alts.
---
I’ve barely explored because any time I leave the area I’m in, something pops up and kills me in two hits. I’m milking this junk pile until I can get enough shit to fix my broken armor.
---
yeah that does sound fun. sadly, the game still lacks crazy prostration moves and bowing and stuff for the shrines.
---
still- every time I see Grahm. I follow him for awhile and emoji 'come over here's' for anyone around.
---
As I am a true Chally-Pally and follower of Grahm: 'He who 'members the words of Smarty'
---
15k at the very least. Maybe more.
---
thats is negotiable 
---
Or rather, pacifist mode should disable damage to CAMPs as well. Let damage for non-pacifists allowed.
---
Whitespring - shopping baskets in the mall area.  When wandering in general keep an eye out for blasting cap boxes, acetone canisters, tin cans (regular cans are steel), and cafeteria trays.
---
You may not be playing the game in the best style for yourself.
---
Are you looking for the disks and notes, and so finding all the resources that are just lying around?
---
Are you sneaking enough or are you going in guns-blazing?
---
Are you using concentrated for perk and taking out legs and heads instead of just shooting at all the center of mass armored torsos?
---
Are you going around, or backtracking from, threats you know you cannot or shouldn't face?
---
This game definitely has a bias that rewards certain types of play. Sneaking. Melee in power armor. Super accurate hip fire of you've got the skills.
---
If you just go from monster to monster and square off you will deplete yourself.
---
The Ballistic Fiber shortage is real, and firecaps are like unicorns, but I'm usually drowning in junk, ammo, and aid. So pick up everything. Bulk and sell your junk. Sneaking with suppressed armor piercing guns and going for headshots via VATS. and don't rush.  This works for me.
---
If you are having a hard time with this game you need to reevaluate your approach.
---
It's not like a side scroller, you don't have to kill everything you see. 😎
---
I usually use a Blue Yeti but it broke right before I tried recording so that’s just on a Corsair headset mic which is why u can hear some mouthy sounds like my lips moving and breathing a big heavier than I’d like.
---
I used audacity to boost the sound a bit but I’m not good with that stuff. And I used my Xbox to record my character sitting in a bunker for the background noise.
---
I’m not super good at audio editing but I hope that helped.
---
"your camp cant be placed" could be a blessing in disguise if you wanna move your camp for free
---
Really? That’s crazy. 
---
That was after patch 5. Until then I was missing many of the Sturdy and Heavy Combat armor plans. I got a complete set of both Sturdy and Heavy after a few days of normal vendor runs and buying whatever I saw I didn't have.
---
That radium rifle will absolutely destroy players if you wanna troll people. I like to get down on some hunter hunter radio and every now and then there's some sick with a fully loaded one of those. Better have your hazmat hot keyed lol
---
Yeah i gotta take 4 gatling plasma's to kill the SBQueen. They all break and do a ton of damage. Its worth it i think. Using them outside of anything but that..... thats a no
---
But with the plans, thats an incentive to do quests and activities. That has an outright purpose. It in no way punishes people, but it rewards them when they go out of their way to acquire them.
---
Say i have a crappy build and need a respec. Should we punish people for making mistakes that have no effect on anyone else? Say i get up there in levels, cant build money worth crap cause my build sucks and this game makes it hard to farm caps unless you hit the vendors everyday. We shouldnt punish someone who is already being punished for bad decisions.
---
The goal is to make people keep on playing. If a respec is what it takes, then let people respec as long as it doesnt give an unfair advantage or detract from play time. As it stands, people are leaving because they dont want to respec.
---
Spoke too soon, every half an hour for 5 hrs crash crash crash crash sometimes I really feel like watching TV or going out. 😭
---
It's the last minute realisation that she did the wrong thing. She wanted her mother back, death stops they occurring
---
Same here. Was putting a level 15 set of raider together for a buddy. Its way better to keep it on a frame. Had to pull out every frame til I found the right one. then you have to put them all away because it puts them in the rack in the order you put them down. So you have to only have the one you want to work on out and near the rack to work on it.
---
This. I've gotten so much aluminium I find I just have to sell it or throw it away. Top of the world (outside and the shop level) and nearby ski lodge have a ton you can farm all in one convenient spot.
---
Here is as good as anywhere.
---
Grahm,
---
I would like to apologize for attempting to remove your head from your shoulders the first time I met you. To this day I still don't understand why your trade route traverses through a scorch infested mining tunnel tunnel. Needless to say I was ready to shoot everything that moved or froze in place. I hope that my purchases helped to smooth over any issues and look forward to seeing you in a less hostile environment.
---
I have a Sword of Bastet, but I don't remember it it being \*that\* good, so I'm guessing you run a more strength based build. I run a mostly Perception/Agility/Luck build, so it would take me a while to re-spec.
---
My level 45 silenced, long barrel, hardened, two-shot, explosive lever action supposedly hits for 196 (*now*, it *used* to hit for over 500).
---
Kind of wish weight reduction perks were passive (just having them made them work) or perk cards also affected stash size but coulnt be removed if it would make your stash go above the limit. 
---
Nah. The most expensive plans are only ~6000, so you can get them in a few days. I'm easily getting over 2k caps a day.
---
You might want to re-read the post. I don't understand why it isn't part of the game? It's not like the marine combat helmet that gives damage resistance, it literally just looks cool. Kinda weird how it was removed for "game stability"
---
I play on PC. Username bubbulzz.  1. I have the Speed Demon, Marsupial and Scaly Skin mutations on my main toon, Esmerelda. I recently made a new toon, Rozalyn and even though she has no mutations my friends have trouble keeping up with me. She moves like she has the Speed Demon mutation. I checked the status and effects and it doesn't show any mutations or diseases. I also have not taken any perks that might increase her movement speed. Relogging doesn't fix it, she has been like this since I made her last week. Is it possible that the game "thinks" that since my main has the Speed Demon mutation, that my other toon has it too?  2. I would like to point out that the challenge to "pick flowers" is broken. It will show progress for flowers that I haven't picked recently then after fast travel, it shows no progress. I can pick 10 flowers and it will show 0 progress. When I say no progress, I mean on the drop down section that tells you which flowers that you can pick. The main part never shows progress. IE. Pick flowers (0/11)
---
(by the way, the drop from the SBQ was a three star legendary exterminators rolling pin... never even thought to try it on the crickets.  did make a nice pie though.)
---
I bought it for 20k caps from a guy on Facebook 
---
&gt;Like energy weapons being utterly terrible but still for some reason being used by the military.
---
Clearly the military are little children who just want to pretend they're cool futuristic aliens and don't care about the fact the weapon is just barely good enough to function as a weapon.
---
Your best bet to farm that zone is have a friend log out and log back in near the golf club.
---
All the ghouls respawn about 75% of the time.  If they don't, then you log out and have your friend stay in.
---
FFS Bethesda please do NOT nerf this.  I feel like I need a disclaimer when offering good solutions to people now :(
---
You act like 20 bullets to shoot with a fully auto weap takes more than a 1hour to shoot, besides being stealth and across 20m from target. Get fckin real man.
---
&gt; Maybe next year you'll grow up.
---
My adult children keep saying that too.
---
But even I can see that personal attacks are *childish.*
---
Is the pocketed armor weight glitch working again? Asking for a friend. 
---
Yeah everyone need a level 50 alt for griefing. Im not loosing 200 caps on my main every time i die. 
---
I try to keep 100 of each junk, bulking/selling the rest. I don't keep unused ammo, but I have 4 sets of power armor, some old quest rewards, and about 10 full fusion cores, all things I don't use.
---
Altogether, the stuff I hold onto in stash adds up to about 400 lbs, plus another 120 on my character, allowing me to accumulate about 350 lbs between the two before I'm forced to deal with it again.
---
Story lead on 76 is Ferret Baudoin, another terrific name, Emil is deisgn leaf. It's possible that it was written by somebody else. 
---
Ski poles are still good. I found more aluminium around Pleasant Valley than I know what to do with. Another good source is the surgical trays in medical areas, and one piece of mole miner gear also has aluminium.
---
I bought mine for 20k, I've seen it go for much, much more though
---
This is never going to happen the game will now feel weird if it had npc in it.
---
Plus he can beat the ever loving crap out of anything that attacks him/you if you're close by
---
I have seen enemies too high for an area spawn tho. When I was level 13 I claimed the wade airport workshop then left it during the defend mission. When I came back there were level 62 bloated ghouls coming after me.
---
Depends which bos suit you’re after, there are three i own. 
---
Knight suit I found laid over a desk inside thunder mountain 
---
Soldier suit was a reward for forbidden knowledge
---
Officer suit plans were found in a train carriage just east I think it is of watoga train station on top of some crates next to a corpse (follow the tracks, there’s an assaultron keeping an eye on it)
---
Does the region you purchase it for have to be accurate? I see regions outside the US are substantially cheaper.
---
It sounds fun, and workable if they make it a way to receive XP that can be cashed in toward whatever you like having / getting in the game. Every large game that has progress from new character to built character could benefit from a system where higher up players are back among the newer ones sponsoring them and all together experiencing the fun that is in the game world!
---
I agree with everything you said except for carrying multiple ammo type weapons. 
---
I actually think that should be emphasized more within the gameplay. 
---
It's better than just using two weapons imo. I wouldn't want an open world RPG that has different weapons and just use one or two. 
---
The problem is they are forcing it upon people with steep restrictions and upkeep. With no reward or cause. 
---
I just want "mmo style" dungeons with trash mobs and bosses with fixed loot tables so you can farm to target gear and build sets. 
---
brave
---
Thanks, will take a look.
---
Make the hermit crab have a house for a shell.
---
PVP should be exclusive to Survival Mode. It was stupid of Bethesda to forece PVP on everyone. Pacifist is a fucking joke. Optional my ass Todd.
---
I don't believe this for one second unless you are using a TSE black powder. I have a decked out hunting rifle with all the perk cards for sniping and I can't scorched sometimes because it's just not powerful enough. That includes being in sneak and even using a crit sometimes. It's true that the black powder can one shot things, especially if it's TSE. But a hunting rifle is ass. Pure ass. 
---
I just activate any pie machine whenever I see and don't forget to check back if it's actually bingo. You have 2 legendary assaultrons charging up on you? No worries, just go to that pie machine. You have a nuke announcement? Not my business before I see that claw landing on the pie. You hear that Graham running full speed nearby while counting shrimps? Nopes, just pie.
---
there is currently a bug where damage values on the pb are inaccruately displayed.  you can look at it once, fast travel somewhere, and it is now a completely different value.
---
TS does apply to all weaps that have it.  It's the pip boy that is wrong.
---
Game is still adjusted for casual weekend players. Not harder at all. You just need to farm more junk now to fix weapons and resupply ammo &amp; cores.
---
You need to exceed the damage thresh hold to kill efficiently, otherwise it's always a grind. My issue is you only have a few options to get there currently with ranged. Rifle Vats crit, sneak, or heavy Gatling build.
---
It's been said pretty often that an in depth look into balancing weapons and enemies is needed. You can whack an enemy once or twice with the best setup or burn through lots of ammo which will take a lot longer
---
Darn kids these days, with their Two-Shots and their Super Sledges.
---
Ikea learned it for its own store.
---
That's seems a bit excessive of a price
---
No idea
---
That is not a guide
---
You can also just skip to the end and go to Glassed Cavern. The goal is to find her, you don't have to hit every point along the way if you don't want to repeat it.
---
I'm not saying you didn't anything wrong. Just the people who up vote you and not like him.   You are giving him exposure at least. 
---
One big issue for this is it takes a good bit of play time to understand what's worth keeping (or important to keep) versus what isn't. Newbies have to make decisions about what's worth keeping with a very incomplete dataset.
---
Fallout: Cheap Cashgrab woulda been a good one
---
Fought her 3 times post patch: successful one with a 3* lead pipe as the reward, unsuccessful one because her health bar stuck, and disconnected one 3 minutes after the fight started. No more shout gun ammo, no more SBQ run.
---
Economy would have tanked within two weeks due to duping.
---
Why pay one guy 2000 caps for a Zealot's Gauss when the guy down the road is selling 100,000 TSE Gauss for 200 caps a piece?
---
Unyielding? The one where you get +2(3?) to all stats when below 25% health? What's so great about that? I sell those types of legendary
---
Serum plans are 21k each. 
---
I don't doubt that. I'm at about 300 hours and I have been anticipating that 400 is prob the line where I exhaust all of the current content. I wasnt making a dig at you, just the thesis in general, and people that rushed the game. 400-700 hours in the 2.5 months that the game has been out = 5-9 hours per day, every day. That's a lot of time to dedicate to a game that "sucks." Not to mention that 400 hours is a pretty good value for a game. Hardly a waste of $60. 
---
&gt; They cripple and stagger better then anything else though
---
Not even close. You shouldn't bet on meaningfully crippling anything unless you're specced for it (enforcer &gt; everything else) or have a +50% limb dmg legendary.
---
Two-shot explosive**
---
Hahahaha oh damn, I sincerely hope this is the content they are going to release lol. 
---
By your logic, TSE guns weren't broken.
---
Stealth and suppressors are working just fine for me still, with 3 Sneak, Escape Artist, and Chameleon mutation.  I can hide from Scorchbeasts easily and unnoticed by enemies within arms reach.  The semi has its points, though, agreed.
---
Plenty of pvp to be had outside of those servers, they may not gain any traction for this reason. 
---
they are also hanging in the golf course whitespring
---
I haven't played in like 4 months but they had a big underwater expansion since I last played. I put in over 150 hours in and still enjoyed it. It's an explanation game with great base building, a great economy, weekly challenges, and a fun community. It doesn't have too much in way of "action." You will be exploring alone most of the time and will rarely fire your weapons (if that's the way you choose to play). the game doesn't explain very much so you will Google a lot if you want to be efficient. But figuring stuff out is part of the game. I have a early version PS4 and I ran into slow downs on my frighter once I added a ton to it.
---
I recommend nms to anyone likes space or to explore. It can be grindy, but it's the enjoyable kind.
---
im not sure where those blasting cap boxes are
---
Good thing Roger was around to set those up.
---
Edit answered it thanks
---
I've never even seeing a lever action. Where do you even get one?
---
&gt;	like they will be the size of far harbor
---
Anybody who thinks this *deserves* the disappointment. 
---
Helping new vault dwellers adjust to the new harsh environment is how we rebuild America.  
---
I’m not selling it anytime soon, thanks for the info.
---
I never encounter people with 24 per map, how would 6-10 work? :/
---
I wonder if theres a datamined list somewhere of the loot tables? That would be interesting to see. I guess if all of that is done server side (no idea one way or the other) they wouldnt be able get those loot tables from the game files.
---
Eh, I paid for the rarity of the item. Plus I had the caps, made back the 20000 in a week with smart trading from the loot I got from legendary farming Watoga.
---
Oh well.  I think I'll be ok with v the fake internet points
---
It already is stupidly easy to get rich, by putting arbitrary restrictions on not only cap limits but restock times all they do is make it more tedious.
---
If you loot every weapon from a single Uranium Fever run, you will literally have to go to every single Faction vendor just to sell them all because all of the Mole Miner Gauntlets, shotguns, and missile launchers together are well over 1000 caps, even without any price increasing perks or chems.
---
The real key here is developing a system where heavy weapons degrades armor DR and eventually breaks armor negating DR.  The first few shots of most of these high speed low damage weapons should do nearly no damage, but should be obliterating enemy armor durability, degrading DR.
---
I just have _one_ of those and it's amazing.
---
If I had _four_ oh jesus
---
I rarely DC. Never lose my stuff. You must have shit internet.
---
Groundwork for the 'Fallout 76: Capital Wastes' expansion?
---
I have the same perks and mutation and chameleon armour (my leather armour is weightless so doesn’t affect the mutation).
---
Stealth is broken for me since the last patch, it’s made me stop playing honestly.
---
I want to start a new character with a different build but nothing seems viable except melee and I hate melee
---
Better level up then! Went to Pleasent Valley the other day (Level 16) and got my ass served to me on a radioactive dinner plate...
---
Never under estimate old man strength 
---
Sounds great as a level 60 that got one shot by a level 289 player last night. 
---
Yeah.. I've seen that and still haven't found the ingredient to make it. And i horde resources
---
This just isn't how shooting games should be.
---
An entire layer of depth and strategy was missed out on because of the mentality that higher level enemies should have higher armor.
---
The logical route for armored enemies in shooters is that if you know an enemy is armored, you think, 'Guess I'll switch to my higher caliber/heavier melee weapon'. You are supposed to re-assess the enemy.
---
This doesn't happen in Fo76. As every enemy variant gains damage resistances it becomes totally meaningless.
---
You don't see a big robot and think you need a bigger gun, you just resign yourself to another damage sponge slog.
---
As everything gains resistance with levels, nothing does. 
---
All that you need to remember as far as combat strategy goes, is that once you pass the savage divide:
---
Slow speed melee is best. Medium is bad unless legendary. Fast speed is a gimmick after lvl 25.
---
Automatic guns are obselete. They are good for using ammo you can't sell sometimes.
---
Slow-firing is the end-game route unless you have a ridiculous legendary effect combo. The 50 cal mg is perhaps the only exception, but it's popular mostly for coolness and easily-crafted ammo, only barely out-damaging the elusive handmade with significant perk investment.
---
He says some really funny shit. Sometimes I just hang around him to listen to what he has to say. Good guy in the wasteland.
---
Yeah... reaching the amount of caps to buy serum recipes is pretty hard IMO
---
You can also continue to extend foundations where they don’t touch the ground by building a stone staircase then placing the foundation in the same spot as the stairs. 
---
Not sure why this works but it helps fill gaps on uneven terrain 
---
The whole "travel to these locations halfway across the map for tidbits of info" thing that ends the quest line screams Emil.
---
I am just over here with hope that fo76 gets better. I bought a xb1 just to play fo76. I really want it to do good. But man is it getting harder and harder for me to like this game.  
---
Where abouts on the map is your house build? Looks like an awesome spot! 
---
It was dead. Less than ten glowing ones. Three Grafton monsters. Three snallygasters and a SB. Little to no flux. It was oddly peaceful. 
---
Crops barely float when I do it, at least with corn, tatos, and mutfruits.
---
Yeah not sure how to fix it myself but my one character is a rifle build and my other a pistol build and with normal enemies including death claws and mirelurks they do fine.
---
Probably not as good as melee but still good enough for me. SB and SBQ is a different story though so not sure how they will balance it out so my builds aren't OP with normal enemies but also able to kill a SB or SBQ solo.
---
Maybe a perk card will help my build that focusses on SB and SBQ only so when I face them I can swap in the card and it evens the field for rifles and pistols.
---
never!
---
Dude, 600 rounds? You must be missing a lot lol, at max build, it shouldnt be taking you 20 shots per super mutant with your handmade rifle, and if your gun is breaking before you are finished with west tek, you are probobly not putting on a stock to help with that because some stocks actually help, you are not using gunsmith, and you are not repairing to 200% condition, with all of those combined, guns take forever to break
---
Idk what to tell you man. I've been lucky enough to get a tse so I've always been using the sniper. Do you use the sneak perks as well? This is pretty much why the gun is so effective. 
---
It's Wadsworth's Constant to the extreme.
---
You've been chosen
---
&gt; Next time you're standing on top of a car or rock to cheese the AI, be proud of how much skill that requires.
---
Hey man, you're forgetting about the true pros like me who can punch Deathclaws to death with unmodded PA arms because I can spam consumables while mashing the melee button about a thousand times! That's really hard! Please validate my sense of superiority from being able to be so easily amused by the tedium of mindlessly mashing buttons. ^pwease
---
You’re absolutely right. 
---
Yeah but shotguns is so 2018. We already know enforcer is the best crippling weapon. I was also referring more so to the SBQ fight. Enforcer does nothing in that scenario. Where heavy weapons can perma-stagger the Queen in mid-air. 
---
Yeah I was helping out a random guy in a nuke zone the other day. I could tell he was struggling a bit when he invited me to his team so I ran around with him to make sure he go through it okay. Even tossed him some RadAway when he ran out. It’s all about looking out for each other. 
---
I don’t agree. I’m not saying you can’t respec, I’m saying you’re limited to how often you can do it. As a courtesy, they should offer a free respec anytime builds are heavily impacted by a change/nerf. However, even with the recent explosive and two shot nerfs, I still do good damage with my TSE combat shotgun though, I’m just not one shotting everything anymore.  
---
If they ever nerfed something so hard that you’d suddenly be unable to make caps in the game, then it’s time to uninstall it. A respec is such a small factor in what this game need to keep people playing. There are so many things wrong with it that it would come as no surprise if it ended up the same way as Mass Effect: Andromeda. Either way, Bethesda has completely lost my faith and trust in them and I’ll never pre-order one of their games again. If they wanted to keep people playing they should have given this another six months of development time, minimum. :D
---
Then stop using heavy guns.  Everyone and their grandmother knows that heavy guns are currently underpowered and not worth their ammo consumption and yet people STILL insist on using them and whining all the while.  Continuing to use inefficient weapons isn't going to make Bethesda fix them any quicker, you're just creating your own punishment for failing to adapt and pick up a better weapon in the meantime
---
Can you post a picture of it when you got time? Never seen it!
---
Aim for the head, there is much less armor there. 
---
That's why I've basically quit running queen, almost literally the only end game content right now.
---
Queen isn't even a guaranteed *** legendary and drops nothing else interesting enough to justify the thousands of rounds I might need to put into her, and that's assuming I manage to just join a queen run. If I need to run the silo first, that's another 20-30 minutes with a lot of bullet sponges between me and the access code. 
---
Thankfully my main lives in power armor so ballistic fiber isn't that important to me, but FO76: Screwed (the hunt for more screws?) Has become quite tedious.
---
I've got a couple hundred hours into it now so I've had my money's worth in time, but the recent changes have turned it into a tedious drag. I realize the TSE nerf was needed but that was also the source of my fallout dopamine rush and now the game is a slog. 
---
Every time I read one of these I am so glad I avoided this absolute dumpster fire of a game. I really hope everyone of you gets in on that class action vs. Bethesda and gets your money back. I’m so sorry this game was so misrepresented and over promised and WAYYY under delivered. 
---
If your wanted status followed you between servers, it might discourage people from griefing.  Or perhaps longer lasting debuffs if you destroy a camp or parts of it.
---
I use a lot of mods and have no issues with the game. You just need to be aware of any changes after a patch and to keep the mods updated. Using mods on a game like this is never a 'set up once and forget it' situation, you will need to keep track of any changes to the game and updates to the mods. Depending on what has changed in the patch some mods may not work anymore (or are even needed) while others will need to be updated.
---
Most of the mods are just visual mods so I don't know what data you think is getting sent or why anyone would be interested in it.
---
Fun. That's why I play. To have fun. As well as be challenged.
---
Some of the games I'm playing and why...
---
RDR2... Fun, relaxing, interesting world, beautiful. The tedious bits are still challenging, so I plan to 100% this one. 
---
BF1 and BFV... Fun, challenging, and 1 has a great sense of place and time.
---
Fortnite... Challenging, coop with friends is fun.
---
Forza Horizon... Beautiful, fun, mindless. Sometimes ya just wanna go fast. 
---
AC... Beautiful and fun, love the time period designs, after a while, gets a little stale/repetitive. 
---
What I'm not playing and why... 
---
Madden... It's become too thick. I want something like Blitz or NBA jam. Personal preference. Fast pace, simple, enjoyable, entertaining. 
---
FO76... Tedious, graphics are stale, world is empty.  Wandering alone to collect piles of plastic just feels like work.
---
Middle earth... Feels like an AC reskin. Just didn't enjoy it after AC. 
---
Why would they want 200 caps when they could just dupe caps? 
---
I have a heavy gunner build, and honestly it’s my heavy hitter. Also, you can literally carry 5 heavy guns for every rifle you can carry with bear arms. Diversify a little, and get even a vanilla Gatling gun.
---
I'm at... 85? I can't remember, haven't played in a few weeks now. At this point even the Voice of Set doesn't help me that much. 
---
GIDDYUP BUTTERCUP!! 
---
RAIDERPRIDE! We hunt you down without mercy and take your stuff.
---
TV dinner trays are aluminum, the cafeteria trays may be plastic,  I usually hit the prison cafeteria where both can be found
---
I dont think there are actually that many. Like I've had one or two bad experiences but hundreds of funny or positive. The reason they seem so much more often is people tend to post about their negative encounters but never about their positive. 
---
Easiest thing to do is get the handmade plan and craft a bunch of them. Then destroy them all and the game will unlock mods as you do this.
---
Fallout 76 is not region locked.
---
You know, the problem is not the stash limit, it's the vendors cap limit. I only store stuff because I can't sell it today. 
---
Fair enough, I hope you find out how to get your hood back, it goes nicely with the coat
---
There's a big difference between using a TSE and using a basic hunting rifle.... 
---
Melee rules all right now. I had a explosive lever that did nice damage pre nerf. Now it takes 5 or 6 shots to kill mutants. My secondary melee build I spec'ed for kills things in 2 or 3 hits at most. 
---
I will try to post one.
---
I'd like more, but ultimately it's not necessary.  People just hoard way too much stuff that weighs more than they think, usually junk or chems that they will probably never touch.  There is always more of everything and you just need to keep a buffer, not a month's supply of gears.
---
I think the idea of having a secondary stash that can be stolen from is, frankly, terrible.  If I don't care about something and would be OK with it being stolen, I may as well just drop it on the ground.
---
Was expecting more of "Power armor with death claw augments" but this works too
---
AAE+headshot+crit=dead
---
Wow amazing job, i wish such additions can be implemented in the game
---
me too. until level 100-120. but we need ammo, steel, lead, fluxes, interesting armor, interesting weapons... uhhh
---
Ran into this too, my main was a tse heavy/shotgun with high str, no agi, no per. My vats-gearee alt is more fun now because I can VATS spam headshots to kill faster than my main currently can. 
---
I used to get a dopamine rush from playing with TSE, now they just make the game slightly less of a slog but it's still quite a tedious process. 
---
Last patch cured me of my fallout addiction, thanks Bethesda!
---
This. People complain about durability and you can carry like 5 of each with Bear Arms. 
---
Thinking of MC? I'm diving back into it myself. 
---
Yes, this sort of thing has been proposed, before they upped it to 600.
---
I carry a bloody explosive gatling, be mingun. The minigun is nothing more than a way to show off my cool chrome paint. It serves no real purpose. Breaks too fast and just ruins my ammo.
---
Leather should be the best sneak armor in the game. Always has been.
---
What's the HP on a level 68 Super Mutant Overlord?
---
At least spit some numbers my way if you want to try and discredit me.
---
If you *** really*** wanted something. Like ***REALLY, REALLY WANT*** you would plan for it. This is the same thing. I didn't have to save Atoms. I knew I would want something eventually from the shop so I always have my savings as a back up. Life is a game, the top players save and plan.
---
Great ideas!  This game is severely unbalanced and every time I say comment saying this, I get downvoted by some tunnel vision fanboys.  The game is completely unbalanced 
---
I rarely comment but i ought to say, this was amazing 
---
I don’t think it’s fair to compare an activity that recommends at least 8 players with end game viability of rifles and other ranged weapons.
---
They make my agility and perception 35 
---
How did you get the corners to snap like that? I can only get one side to snap facing away, and then the other refuses to snap in that one direction
---
If you put in the build you want to end up with, it'll show you a leveling roadmap, that details the most efficient way to get there. If you need something more than that, feel free to be more specific. 
---
I stand corrected - thanks :)
---
not anymore
---
Outside of the current player base, I agree there is a huge pool, but I don’t see them beating down the door to play. I can imagine the meeting with TE PowerPoint showing the daily players in Fortnite or PUBG and the sales projections if they can tap into that market. It will be interesting to see their latest SEC filing and their ROI on Fallout 77. 
---
I enjoy them they are amazing. If you come across any 3* hmu lol
---
Youll never find it
---
Congrats you've won FO76! The real victory condition is to uninstall and play a better game
---
I have one
---
I meant to say I've never been lucky enough. My bad.  
---
I thought maybe this was fixed as I haven't had it in a while.
---
Nah thats a totally different area of the map. Everyone knows how to get the aline blaster.
---
Dipshit
---
Yes.  All valid points.   But Bethesfa made decision to force people down single lanes.   Maybe it was their view of multiplayer?   Perhaps seeing vast majority of mmo have classes and roles, they chose to do the same.   While fallout 76 is very similar to fallout 4, you cannot play the se way.   Cannot collect never ending junk because they need to make junk respawn.    Respawn timer of 30 in game days would never work for 76.  With the specific "roles" they encourage grouping.    Well that last bit did not work such really because of distrust in community.  But they also mentioned that your not supposed to encounter many survivors so, not really sure what their intent was.   But grouping in this mmo is a bit lacking unless your playing with friends you already know.  My opinion here.
---
Ablative armor? Makes sense to have it work that way to me.  But it would go both ways, does our armor start going down as it's damaged?
---
100 should be the max, except for something you go through a lot of like maybe lead.
---
Once I realized how much 100 gears weighs in the stash (compared to inventory with Pack Rat), I purged most of my junk.  Same with chems.  Run lean, just keep what you will need in the very near future.
---
\*puts on tin foil hat\*
---
Yeah I think the primary reason we are seeing a lot nerfs and next to no buffs is to get player power levels down.  You could argue even the xp nerfs didn't really make any sense at all.  I know people have said its to make the game last longer, but what exactly is lasting longer?  
---
The quests still take the same amount of time to complete and there really isn't much end game.  And does anyone really care if you are level 200, picking up extra perk cards to swap in and out?  Your combat strength doesn't really change after you max your special points.
---
Well, Bethesda might care if they still plan on monetizing those perk cards in the future.  Hard to sell you perk packs if you have them all.  Also no reason to pay real money for perk cards if you are already bulldozing content with over powered legendary weapons.
---
The perk cards and packs are a bad system in general.  All the other fallout games had better progression models.  Even a level capped Fallout 4 system would be better.  The only reason you put this much effort into a new system that feature "packs" is if you plan on selling them at some point.
---
God this one is frustrating. I got through all 3 waves, killed the 3 bosses, killed the first 2 swarms, killed most of the third swarm, then spent a vast majority of the time searching for the last mirelurk of the swarm just for time to expire.
---
I found mine on scorched in The Mire.  I just scrapped a few for the mods.  Also there’s a vendor who sells the plans.  The Free State vendors have the plans too.  The plan is labeled Plan: Lever Gun
---
Short answer, No.  
---
Why?   
---
It would be a massive violation on a number of levels to publish a mod that loved assets from '76 into FO4.  
---
Additionally the files are set up in a way; generally that '76 can handle a FO4 file, but FO4 can't handle a '76 file
---
Ok, but I have never found one in 200+ hours of play, so your advice is not that helpful.  The only weight reduction I found is for junk, which gets me to a ridiculous reduction with Pack Rat, but then I have to carry my junk and risk losing it.
---
Where did you get it
---
If you wanna dress like a tree, thats on you.  I will murder bitches with leather style and be less snek
---
I did need to when trying to learn armor mods.   Used up tons of plastic and had to go to the schools specifically for that.   Otherwise, I have had similar results.
---
It was marketed as an online softcore survival RPG.  When you are spending a majority of your time farming mats to support the survival aspect... that is not "softcore"
---
I'll add ya lostmytaco66 
---
Wow. Ive found like 10.
---
Your authority is not recognized in Fort Kickass.
---
Nice build!
---
Melee. I switched to melee to avoid the bullet bullshit and guns and it made the game playable. I almost quit before trying out melee
---
Have they still not bugged it? Jeez.
---
&gt; It was very bad for Bethesda to limit us.
---
God forbid you realize that this game is different and change your behavior to match it!
---
troll farm has selected this post for mass downvotes, so even though i personally think your idea is gold, it probably wont be seen by anyone else :/
---
maybe there can be some other "super" events? like "super line in the sand" or "super distant thunder" where its almost as tough as the SBQ and requires lots of people to join to complete? 
---
idk though tbh, i feel like all legendaries should be removed from the game just for balancing purposes. the game seems to be 100% about getting loot, but... i dont feel like that is in the spirit of the fallout universe... 
---
if they are going to add content at this point, its going to be micro transaction shit like atomic shop garbage. they arent going to something cool like more random encounters. 
---
Do u happen to have an extra one?
---
The manor is the central mission hub and it takes you to logical locations, for example fleshing out the story of the Raiders by traveling to the Cutthroat Camp. 
---
 Just bought it after being so afraid to but I literally had no other game on my wish list at the moment.
---
Honestly people are tripping their asses off, this game reminds me so much of Fallout 4. I’ve been having a blast. I haven’t had 1 disconnect, no “bugs” that have had me question my purchase, and the photo mode is a lot of fun for me too. 
---
I’d just take it slow. I’m avoiding the quick guides and stuff to learn on my own and keep the immersion.
---
This game is an awesome and hardcore survival in my opinion, and the live action VATS is pretty sweet once you get the hang of it.
---
Im pretty sure this game uses fallout 4’s damage formula so against a 100 damage resist target, the first scenario would cause you to do 25 damage per shot and that would mean 250 damage total, in the second scenario you would do 64ish damage per shot so that would mean about 320 damage
---
I’ve even tried logging into the game in the early morning hours. I was shocked to see others on the server and the mats gone. I’m still enjoying the exploration of the game and it’s a nice surprise to find something new every now and then but the existing game loop is wearing thin for me.
---
They are not available in the game right now
---
Somehow I always make it in time with like 3 or 4 minutes left. Praise be to Mothman.
---
What is a free state vendor?
---
Happened to me yesterday. My main melee Super Sledge 3\* went missing. Raised a ticket with Bethesda support. 
---
Did you raise a ticket and get yours returned?
---
and for some reason automatic melee weapons (chain saw, buzz blade, ripper, drill) get HUGE boosts when overrepaired. Like, 300-400% more damage.
---
Gameplay is too far off from MMOs for me to consider it an MMO lite like Destiny or such. Its really just a more grindy fallout but same core gameplay with some other people running around, but i mean hell, literally everything is soloable even
---
And they have lots of time to figure it out.  You start the game with an empty stash and it takes a good while to fill it.
---
Then you will hit 750 and ask for more.
---
Did a trade with someone but wasn’t sure how much it was worth.
---
Chainsaws in general? Or the plans? 
---
Are you sure it's not just distant gunfire? 
---
This site has translated the levelled lists into a graphical representation. [https://saor-gaming.co.uk/Fallout76Items/](https://saor-gaming.co.uk/Fallout76Items/) However, this doesn't seem to cover vendor lists, just static spawn locations in the game.
---
There's 3 standard Western and single action
---
Harpers Ferry vendor and any vendors found in The Mire are most likely Free State vendors
---
What's the formula?
---
That doesn't make any sense. It would be easier to understand if you can illustrate the math you used to arrive at your conclusion.
---
Quit now.
---
Make armor durability based on # of hits, not damage? I can see that sucking for players too, but hey, balance?
---
Oh you can find one at Tangara Town in the Mire. Its a town elevated on a tree, very cool location. Around the tree base usually theres a mega sloth wandering around.
---
The place is not drawn on the map, you'll have to find it by going there. But its easy.
---
North cranberry bog there's a green building which is robco building. North of this there's a grey/brown building which is valley galleria. From here if you cross the river there's a ransacked bunker and a bit more north you can find the Tangara Town. 
---
I've scrapped so many over the past few weeks, I'm no longer learning any new mods from scrapping pipe weapons. Are you absolutely certain changing the ammo-type on pipe rifle is something you can do in FO76?
---
He spawned at my camp in whitesprings the other day. I was super stoked to see what I would get and was totally let down. 
---
Kinda sucks for them that many games are coming out in feb/march.
---
What system are you on?
---
I believe I am in the 300-400 hours of game play mark. (Not 100% on that because not at home to confirm) I can count many days where I put in 4-8 hours of game play just walking around and killing MOBs. I am starting to not enjoy the game.   
---
I am trying to keep with it. Hoping that the next update will be the thing to turn it all around. I remember when Black Desert 1st came out and I was a day one player. I enjoyed just killing wolfs in the low level zone. It is what I did. I really enjoyed it. Then after so many hours and life coming in I quit playing Black Desert. Then almost a year later came back to Black Desert and it was great. I did more stuff. I traveled the world of that game.   
---
I am just over here hoping that fo76 gets better. Just keep going. 
---
Appalachia is ours, **HOO-MAN.***
---
Yeah, asking for a whole new storage/UI paradigm in the current game state is a great idea!
---
I get this too, sometimes a relog is not even fixing it. Kind of frustrating when trying to get xp, that enemies just die before you can reach them. 
---
The exploding is legendary robots dying. They will explode within 10 seconds of dying. Sometimes, you anticipate this and wait for it. Nothing happens for 30 seconds. You think, hmm this one is probably glitched out. You go for the loot, and BOOM!
---
Its not you man. You're playing right, the problem is Bathesda knows the game is bad, and they know they have no content. So instead of working on adding more they're making the game artificially longer with "balancing" the game which is just them making the grinding longer so you can't push through the little content they actually do have
---
You must have like bad internet or something lol
---
Such a lost opportunity. They had all the resources _right there_ in Zenimax Online. They could have repurposed and redesigned and built on all those mistakes that ESO learned from during its first attempt. It’s not even anywhere near a perfect game and it still highlights just how incompetent the 76 team was. 
---
we call her jiminia now, you misogynistic scum!
---
but yeah, thats the secret of troll farms, they pick names like "daxfever18" or "smalltits2000" to throw you off. i can tell you right now my name is jasmine and im a 29 year old half white half indian girl who weighs 109 lbs and has a b-cup... and without proof, you have no way of knowing if that is true. the internet provides anonymity. everybody is shroedingers cat until you open the box and see a fat white guy with a neckbeard. 
---
Interesting. I just visited, they didn't have the plan. So strange
---
/u/ladydevann is there any way we could get some sort of explanation for the loot tables? 
---
I like it, I don't have to leave &amp; join the game 50 times to find 1 plan
---
It is a survival game not a walk in the park. They make the game like that because they want you to be challenged and feel good when you accomplish something.
---
That's why I quit. Was trying to make excavator PA and they changed workshops so it gives ore and you need more AND acid, that was the last straw for me. All these people that literally play for a living are bitching about no end game because they hit level 100 in a week and I'm getting bent over as a too-late-to-matter measure. I didn't get the game till christmas and they were already turning up the tedium dial. They will never get another penny out of me.
---
I'm not suffering...
---
I'm enjoying the ever loving shit out of it! /S
---
Me too, yesterday for the first time
---
And that’s what they’re trying to get away from (and we should be encouraging)
---
Play bloodied. It feels a lot like survival in Fallout 4. You need to make sure your shots are well placed and you get your kill in two to three bullets. And on the flip side you die in a few hits as well. You have to be more strategic playing like this, and the stakes feel higher. 
---
Why ??
---
You artsy people make me so jealous! 
---
This pic is fantastic! 
---
Ps4 
---
Hazmat vs a radium rifle just means you die from the bullets instead of the radiation. Better be in power armor instead...
---
It might have made an interesting caps sink if they had a new random plan replace the slot of the one you bought so it could cycle as people bought from them.
---
Everywhere, roughly 6 inch by 6 inch by 3 inch red blocks just sitting around.  More at mines and mining facilities, but they show up in fridges, desk drawers, etc.
---
You'd think that if there are so many of these things that there'd be one or two that weren't empty, or that blasting caps would be a thing in the game, but nope - just everyone in the pre-wasteland got the memo to empty those cans of blasting caps, throw the caps into the sea, leave the boxes all over their homes and places of business, and then never speak of it again.
---
I assume they're ramping up the grind ahead of announcing 'heh guys great news FO76 is free to pay' Bethesda will then try to say they are giving back to the community. Why anyone bought or plays this game I have no idea. Played, completed and lived all previous Fallout games but FO76 is awful. 
---
It’s not enough but they still can’t fix server stability so I’m very anti-stash increase. Please move on to complaining about other things. 
---
The main problem for me is junk.  Constantly having to micro-manage it.  Also having to keep a bunch of crap weight cards in my build because I can never offload my junk and ammo into the stash.
---
I can be selective on what legendaries I keep in there, no problem!
---
Just let me stash my junk, ammo, and meds please :)
---
The other day I looked at the map to maybe head to the junkyard. A low level had claimed it, less than level ten. I noticed a guy lvl 66 hanging around. Eventually he claimed the workshop from the low level. For some reason my blood boiled. So I got into sneak mode and over 30 minutes I slowly stalked the lvl 66 back to his base. Just a slow creep after him. Finally I got up to the walls of his base, hit him with my AA Fat man and finished him with a bloodied 50 cal. It was one of the most exhilarating experiences I’ve had on fallout. Especially afterwards when I had a wanted tag and was constantly looking over my shoulder and too paranoid to carry junk. 
---
My cat is angry at your post
---
Yes. But all pipe weapon rechambered receivers require plans. See the spreadsheet I published here:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout\_76\_all\_plans\_recipes\_weapons\_weapon\_mods/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
Pipe Bolt Action can be chambered from .308 to various .38 receivers with plans.
---
Pipe Semi-Auto can be chambered from .38 to various .45 receivers with plans.
---
Pipe Revolver can be chambered from .44 to various .38 receivers with plans.
---
Are the Railway rifles under work by the devs? They’re bugged and don’t receive bonus damage from the rifleman set of perks while they fit the rifle category. Thanks.
---
Just seperating ts and e And reducing demo expert on the legendary exploding weapons would have been enough. I worked hard grinding and found an explosive lever gun. It was powerful but i had to be careful. They nerfed the guns baddd. Can't hardly carry multiple rifles either bc of weight issues.  Just a fricken mindless nerf
---
Current stash limit is definitely not enough but they still can’t figure out server stability so until they fix that I’m very anti-stash increase. 
---
I wouldn't mind a random vendor selection changing once a day, at least for plans that can be obtained by other means. And making it the same across all servers would prevent server hopping.
---
Boi, you mean time to farm fusion cores!
---
Agree to the whole statement. We feel your pain. Personally I stopped playing yesterday and wont play again till it's better. Liked the game. At one point. Now, nostalgia is all I come back for... That's not enough. 
---
the plan the chainsaw itself is but only lvl 20
---
So if I have concentrated fire rank 3 and a duplicate concentrated fire rank 1, should I restart my character? I’m only level 9 I believe. It really bugs me to see that useless card in my deck 🙃
---
Yes. Either give me more stash or let me store shit on alt characters more easily. Better yet, both. 
---
it seems to me that you didnt play the other games for very long. the fans of the game, the ones who drive the conventions and pay the fists of cash for the merch and buy into the marketing... those people play for thousands of hours. thats who this game was supposed to be aimed at. those people are not playing for thousands of hours, instead capping off around 450 hours. as far as MMOs alone go... my wow played time is something like 2 years on my main. 
---
you see the problem? there are lots of people who are still playing fallout new vegas today. people with over 50k hours in new vegas. there are people with over 50k hours in skyrim. there are people with over 30k hours in fallout 4, which wasnt even released that long ago. 
---
surely you see the disconnect right? thousands of hours versus hundreds of hours. 
---
Chainsaws spawn at a very few select spots (don't even bother getting one though since they're complete garbage like all other low damage weapons) and there are no plans for them available.
---
I just hate that a vendor can be selling a item for 1700 Caps. If the vendor already has max-ed stash of 200 I buy said Item. The max vendor stash stays at 200. Or even better. I buy 200 stuff from the vendor. Then buy the 1700 Cap item then the Max Vendor Stash goes back up to 200. Then exit out go get some items from my stash to sell the vendor. The vendors stash goes back down to 0 caps. 
---
paulofg1980 - level 88
---
This game doesn't know what it wants to be, and the constant nerfing of content has had the effect of nullifying the need to take Workshops, their terrible output makes it pointless to invest time and resources into them. 
---
The balance is the biggest issue, the risk/reward in this game is low, and yes I said it's broken at the design level because it is, it doesn't know what type of game it wants to be, a run and gun loot and shooter? A survival game? A PVP battle royal? A coop team based experience? A social experience to rebuild? 
---
They tried to cram all of it in and it doesn't work, aspects of the game features just come across as unnecessary and more of a hindrance than an interesting gameplay feature. 
---
Also each patch release so far has fixed very little, the game is as broken now as it was at launch, and aspects of the game have been "known and discussed" since launch like terrible automatic/heavy weapons, all energy weapons being terribly broken, and a multitude of other bugs that keep popping back up or refusing to be "fixed".
---
After over 2 months the game is as broken, the only thing they have done is nerf, but not balance, nerfed into oblivion. 
---
I defended this game a lot at launch and sank a lot of time into it, played No Man's Sky too so the experience from that gave me hope but seeing BS attitude towards the player, having community managers answer players worries and problems with "we are aware of that issue" and "I will bring this up with the development staff" only for the next patch to ignore pretty much all of that and continue to nerf content leading to more community anger and recently said community manager disappearing...
---
I'm sorry if that was another tangent of escalation, I liked this game, and I wanted it to improve but BS's attitude stinks and is similar to how Bungie ran D1 back in the day, the whole "we hear what your saying but we are the games developers so I think we know what's best for our game, so we will continue to ignore you and do whatever we want and you will play it".
---
By all means continue to defend this game, continue to play it, that's fine, I'm likely to pop back on now and then to see how it's progressing but don't try to insinuate it's fine, that nothings wrong with it and the games amazing. 
---
I know there are mods to downgrade combat rifles to .38.  Not sure on upgrading the pipe rifle though.
---
Maybe check FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  A lot of people are selling plans there for caps.
---
I mean, clearly you didn't since you are here whining about whining. 
---
This actually looks pretty close to the original APA design. Would have been awesome to see it implemented, even if it was 2d...the deathclaws were already being trained as military weapons, adding armor would make sense
---
I play as a male character, but I wear the nurses uniform and the ritual mask.
---
Doesn't look good :/
---
Walked around with a similar Cain from lvl 60-70. Not bad for when you want to demoralize people in pvp. 
---
thx bruh
---
Do Bots on Parade event.
---
works for me
---
Have a look around the sub. The games broken, buggy, and unbalanced. Its not if but when hours of your hard work gets unmade. 76 is a failed experiment.
---
yep, since the launch.
---
I had a similar suggestion, but (as you put it) "pallets" specifically for wood and steel.

I stopped playing in Dec when they patched the infinite carry weight glitch. If I were to log in now I'd be at 55K weight. Yes I did that to myself but it make the game more manageable and freely played without all the restrictions. On PC I never faced any of the server issues people were claiming. It was a great time with no issues honestly. Until they allow mods where I can get my weight back I won't be playing again. Only way around would be to just start anew.
---
That change pretty much crushed my Power Armor modding business.  I spent a lot of time and a LOT of caps trading for those rare jetpack and calibrated shock plans.  Now they're virtually worthless compared with what I traded for to get them...lol
---
Fantastic!  Look forward to hearing an update. 
---
CD Keys had it for around £12.99 for PC
---
Under level 30, do not ever repair armor. Craft new ones if you do not find wnough.   Focus on making stuffed leather armies.   No other armor can compare with physical/energy except the chest piece.
---
Do not carry around bunches of weapons.  Stick with 2 at most.   Get the perk for finding extra ammo if need.   You will always find guns, no need to carry extra.  They will be a bit weaker but will hold you in a pinch.
---
Set limits of max items in stash.  Like 75 of each broken down junk component except maybe steel, lead, screws, springs.
---
Make sure you get white knight to reduce age to your armies and gunsmith to reduce damage to your weapons.
---
I understand both sides of this.  However, I am really glad to see some recipes hat I have NEVER seen during more than 250 hours in game.
---
Nah, 100 Mbps. I rarely dc'd before this, and that was when they shut down individual servers I think. Definitely not 4x in a 10 minute span. I also didn't think dc-ing was a real problem until now. 
---
This.  I find that the right combination of mutjuice, tatojuice and blackberry juice gives you a *glowing* trail, which is quite a nice Easter egg from the devs.
---
i think for super distant thunder you should HAVE to do the arty mechanic. just to thin the heard enough to make it doable. otherwise you just get swarmed by uglies. 
---
Why can't this be a feature?
---
You called OP "diaper baby" over this then you post this diaper baby response 🤦‍♂️
---
But what if they don't have the right perk to put it on themselves? Even if you have the loose mod you need the perk to put it on, right? I had to switch my perks to put on the heated coil on my sledge before
---
Seriously, I googled where to find a plan, went where it told me, and there it was. Didn't have to spend hours trying to find what I was looking for. Shit, I was able to track down 2 different plans from 2 different vendors, all on the same server.
---
Yeah, I'd love to be able to craft up some mods without having the piece there.  It would definitely be a much easier way to trade mods for caps.
---
Half the time when someone shows up and wants mods at my place, they don't have a mic and I have to spend 10-30 minutes emoting for them to get the hint that I need the leg / arm / whatever from them first....lol
---
Touche
---
Only when down to a quarter health tho. What does having PER and AGI that high really do tho? Lots of VATS action?
---
Damage Reduction = 1 - ((Damage/DamageResist)*0.15)^0.365,
---
1 - ((100/50)*0.15)^0.365 =~0.36 -&gt; Damage Reduced by 36%, therefore 64*5=320 like i mentioned
---
1 - ((50/50)*0.15)^0.365 =~0.5 -&gt; Damage Reduced by 50%, therefore 25*10=250 like i mentioned
---
I guess my point is this game isnt in any state to start disincentiving respecs or any feature. Maybe in the future, but as it stands this game should make every effort to be accomodating to the players before it starts making it harder.
---
I decided to be melee build way back at lvl 20. I feel like the gunner community of the game got screwed. I feel back for yall. 
---
I wish you could cook with purified water instead of boiled water.
---
Well I think I'll give it a honest go cant be no worse than my favorite fallout which was NV. My God the bugs in that game, even deleted my saves a few times lol still my favorite though.
---
It's raider-esque, the tattered field jacket is held together with duct tape. Kinda a junk feel.
---
Its worse.
---
It might be that your body is not "at" your base until you can see the world.
---
There might be some random location where everyone in that "zone" is held until they actually spawn in.
---
Just a theory / guess :)
---
Whaaaat??? My mind is blown that this is a thing. This is the kind of scenario I'd imagine happens very early in development where someone who doesn't really understand math codes it in, and then it gets fixed immediately. In every game I've ever played armor reduces a flat % of damage incoming. 
---
The perk Hard Bargain should also increase max caps the vendor has. 
---
True. You work in PR and screw up to jump on that and you make it better ASAP. 
---
It’s almost like the beta of yesteryear is the release candidate of modern times, and anyway, patches are content - from a certain point of view.
---
Check my name, I ain't from Bethesda. 
---
Fo76 has it's issues BUT those issues were noticable within the first hour of playing. I've stretched that out to about 30-40 hours now and boy, has it been a challenge.
---
The game lacks fundamental ingredients that make RPGs enjoyable.
---
I love Fallout. I enjoy the feeling of playing a Fallout game. Unfortunately that's one of the only things that keeps you playing in fo76. Not exciting gameplay, or unique story, or cutscenes, or updated visuals. 
---
Just nostalgia and the desperate want for a new Fallout game.
---
If you have invested more than 100 hours on this game then you have "got your monies worth". The point is that 100+ hours of gameplay should have been 10x more enjoyable than it is in fo76s current state.
---
I'm hoping that when I spend my 50-100+ hours on this game it will be after it's fixed, updated and has new content. Otherwise it won't be worth it. 
---
There are better games out there that will give me more enjoyment for less time invested. 
---
Well said sir
---
Underwhelming loot is everywhere in the game
---
Lol why are you logging random strangers playtime and complaints? Get a life 
---
Another fun issue, if you are moving things and then cancel them (with *Tab* on PC), it will put them back and make them unmovable without logging. That gets old really fast. 
---
Console - Xbox One X
---
Gamertag - Wtfcircus
---
Issue 1 - Load in to The Whitespring Station in only First Person view, Pip Boy does not activate and can’t move forward only look around. I have died this way before because I cannot move. 
---
Issue 2 - This happens most of the time, no weapons will actually work. They are armed but I cannot shoot or use melee. Fix for me that works is manually activating a new weapon then it’s back to normal. 
---
Issue 3 - I am unable to place my power armor in craft station as it floats above my head. Fix for me is getting in armor walking over to station and removing myself from the armor. 
---
Yeah it's bad. I think it should be redone to one wave + legendary Queen at the end. 
---
Yeah, I use it on my stealth sniper. So agility bumps his sneak and perception bumps his vats. Head shot sneak damage all day. Although they have been reducing hidden pretty hard lol. Sneak is their next Nerf factor. 
---
When u/VauIt-Tec eventually leaves the vault and sees the ***ahem***

---
he'll start going to camps to get people to join him in the test vaults in VTU.
---
Gotchya, looks like I gotta hunt down some plans. Thanks!
---
This is seriously how they did damage resist? Did they fail high school math? 
---
What the hell??? 
---
Sorry to burst the bubble, but hey! Haha just wanted to add that there are perks that go towards buffing damage towards players and structures. Heck, there’s even trophies that you can unlock by killing 20 players in pvp, etc. 
---
All I’m sayin is it’s really part of the game, and you’re right that some folks wanna play a Fallout: Wasteland Sims game instead, so it’ll be best if you guys get a completely different mode where nobody kills or destroys each other in the post apocalyptic wasteland and have tea parties (if you haven’t checked the nw part of the map there’s actually a mad tea party easter egg). 
---
There’s a big difference between griefing and “raiding”.
---
its almost a science at this point. youre not alone. it seems like there are stages people go through, and youre at the last couple stages. "well im playing hoping the next patch fixes the game" is something a lot of the posts have said. then there is a disney world comparison "well _____ didnt do well the first week it came out". 
---
the big issue, i think, is that the games that had these awful starts acknowledged it, and worked to fix it. thats not happening with bethesda. they are STILL more focused on the atomic shop than the actual game. despite bad press, bad reviews, bad critiques, and a very vocal community... instead of fixing their problems, or bringing in new talent to try something else, they hired troll farms and social media teams to counter the negative reactions of people....
---
youll see, just as nearly everyone else will see... and it will only be another hundred hours for you. 
---
100% agree. Adventure servers should be pure PvE. No player-to-player damage and no player-to-camp damage.
---
Yep, I can see it from that perspective. Either way, they better act quick and with far less fumbles if they want to prevent this game from flatlining.
---
Yeah I was confused by that comment. 10mm smg can be great. Maybe he meant 10mm auto pistol.
---
Oh shit. Well, how likely is it that they can fix this mess?
---
Yesterday, I was fighting the scorchbeast queen (SBQ) and this happened. I had to wait about 10 minutes to queue back into the server. Luckily, it was still terrorizing everyone and I helped dispatch it.
---
Thank you for taking the time to illustrate that.
---
What an odd way of calculating armor penetration. Why even bother putting low DMG weapons in the game?..... no wonder they can't balance the game for shit.
---
It doesnt really matter anymore. bonus ends today.
---
Yeah, I would *love* to have separate stashes for junk and think that would be the ideal end goal but in the meantime adding a single "pallet" item would clear up some clutter, add an interesting decor item, and not require code modifications. That last part is why I suggested pallets like this. If it's just a matter of adding a new workshop item it wouldn't take away from the coder's time to implement.
---
Well darn ! Pulls up pants* "I'm ready!"
---
Killed 3 so far and all 3 dropped pretty much the same useless crap. 
---
Emil has a habit of sending you back and forth (or to adjacent locations) for info scraps or "events" (go half way across the map to push a button) that then immediately send you back to where you just were. Emil's fingerprints are all over this. 
---
Also, Emil seems to think that simply going to a location constitutes story.
---
250 Atom Shop :Cry Emote: T-T 
---
Remember we are always waiting for you to slip up so we can take your shit
---
Bethesda, I know this is a minor thing, but finding loot bags (or even meat piles) is incredibly difficult for me, being colourblind. Can we have some sort of outline with a changeable colour so that we can see them through Grass/ground debris?
---
I have 2 characters (one lvl 105 and another lvl 30) I literally quit playing because I noticed it was harder and harder to lvl up my 30. Also, sometimes the stupid characters glitch and I can’t freakin hit them. I gave up and went back to play Fo4 and kingdom hearts....
---
You are spawning in on firecracker berries.
---
&gt;There’s a big difference between griefing and “raiding”.
---
The only difference between griefing and raiding it what the attackers chose to call it, to everyone else you’re just an asshole.
---
I have no idea what the bobblehad finder perk or the other one sound like, but they have some sort of proximity alert. Do you have that perk and are you somewhere, where a bobblehead or cap stash spawns?
---
Long term the way they did it will hurt the longevity of the game and generally is counter productive for the community building they advertised.   
---
Why find someone who specialized in becoming a power smith and getting all the mods when you can just buy them..
---
They did say "most" plans can be found at vendors, with the exception of a special few
---
really I'd make the durability higher but the cost to craft them as well as maintenance higher as well this would off set the higher durability but give people more fun time 
---
example  
---
5x weapon durability  
---
2.5x Craft cost and repair cost 
---
this would give people a lot more time using a weapon before needing to go back to camp for repairs   
---
Maybe this is too late, but hopefully you still get this/people still read this. I've not really used explosives or melee. My main weapons are a combat rifle and a handmade rifle with the rifleman perks.  I can see the game being harder at low levels, but knowing to spec to certain things helps out alot and if you have a group to run with that also that helps. I do play solo more often than not and I'm level 140ish with very few issues the way I have things set. I don't have many gripes with the game, but I do wish there was a perk loadout system (more for quality of life). 
---
**Repairing/Ballistic Fiber**
---
Weapon/Armor repairs are a pain, but especially for armor. At low levels White Knight (unlocks at level 39 and is 3 ranks) is still a viable perk to grab as soon as you can and even at high levels after the nerf so that you use less ballistic fiber to repair.
---
If you can make it to the Cranberry Bog alot of the military bases have junk that can scrap into ballistic fiber: 
---
Military Grade Duct Tape (2 Ballistic Fiber)
---
Military Ammo Bags (I think, is 1 ballistic fiber)
---
I have a float of 100 ballistic fiber in my stash at all times and have sold my excess off after repairing. I was at Cranberry Bog below level 30 (before nerfs) and wasn't having too many problems killing things or avoiding things. 
---
Another perk you should consider spec-ing into is Fix-It-Good/Weapon Artisan which at max rank increases durability by another 100% when repairing. Both of these perks I don't keep on, I only switch to them when I'm repairing.
---
I carry 3-4 trusty guns. That are 200% durability and with the gunsmith perk degrade slowly (even with that nerf, if there was one, I'm not sure about that) I don't have any weight reduction perks other than maybe 20% off from a legendary armor prefix.
---
If you are low on any scrap "mark it" and it will have a magnifying glass on any junk items that might have what you're looking for or just know what junk has what scrap. 
---
**More ammo**
---
For getting more ammo the Scrounger perk is good for when searching ammo chests/gun bags hit the respective "search" button to get a chance at more ammo.
---
I switch to Ammosmith &amp; Super Duper to make more ammo and have a chance of a 2 for 1 craft from Super Duper, but this is more difficult if you have trouble finding lead, steel, gunpowder, plastic...etc.
---
I understand people's general issues with the game, but these specific problems you're having there is a solution for. Is it grindy? Absolutely it is. but once you have a system down for taking care of those things you can really start to enjoy the game. I thought of the figuring out how to survive as a puzzle that once completed you can reap the rewards of your hard work. 
---
**For weight problems** 
---
I've also got "Thru-hiker" and "Travelling Pharmacy" to help reduce the weight of my food and chems. For efficiency in healing/hunger I have "Good Doggy" which triples the effectiveness of dog food. I've had no issues finding/making boiled water or getting purified water, "Dromedary" is good for increasing how much thirst you fix. I'm carrying at any time 100+ stims of multiple types (diluted, super &amp; reg), I don't take much damage since most things die before they get to me.
---
For ammo weight problems, Bandolier is a must at max rank ballistic ammo (not energy ammo) weighs 90% less. Right now I've got over 8,000 shotgun shells, 6000 45s, 5000 5.56s and all together I think they weigh a total of 5 pounds on me (way more in stash, so I just carry them around).
---
Deep pocket all your armor when you're able to. This adds 10 lbs per piece. Right now my total carry weight is 290 without power armor and I'm usually at about 230-250 (my stash is usually at max, lol).
---
I want people to enjoy the game as much as I have and still am so any other questions let me know!
---
Yeah now my pipe revolver is officially better than my tse handmade.....
---
Kids these days... not up for a challenge.
---
Feel like it should be mandatory for everyone to play fallouts 1 &amp; 2 before anything else... so they realize how good we have it now.
---
13 damage really isn’t scary, and neither is 26. Robot armor is an excellent counter, but nobody runs this gun since there are lots of legit oneshots in the game.
---
I can relate and yes I am almost about to put this game to the back burner. I have tried time and again to give this title a chance but its just un-playable and spending rediculous amount of time sorting inventory, repairing and scavenging. Oh not to mention having to check my pip boy every 10 minutes to heal myself or preventing myself from being parched. I'd rather go back to 3, 4 and New Vegas. 4 was my all time favorite and I may go back to it. You being a fan I can see the disappointment to this title. 
---
Isn't screenshot one word
---
Hold up I got you mate
---
Ho-Lee -Schitt!  Went to Steam and it’s half off. Praise Talos. 
---
I play in short bursts.  Hit a few vendors, maybe a event, explore a spot on the map, etc.

---
By something like a Bobby pin and it resets the vendors caps. 
---
Want to trade for an junkie's gatling gun?  Because that's all I find
---
The pipe-semi auto cannot be converted to a pipe bolt-action or pipe revolver (the two that do benefit from both rifle and pistol perks). Those are three different kinds of weapons, and they can each be rechambered to another caliber, but that doesn't change the weapon's type.
---
Dont know, melee is op. I think sometimes people appear hostel and can be killed, I see no other way that this can happen. But it's happened twice, the first guy only killed me once, second guy killed me twice. I'm also wondering if it has to do with what other people on my team are doing. I also get a CAUTION messages when I crouch that lasts for hours, I think that has something to do with it too.
---
Uninstalling is the end game! 
---
WOOOOOOO!!! 
---
Weapon degradation is awful on many of them, but that's been a problem since day one. It really is funny but also a bit sad to see the massive amount of outrage now that so many people who cheesed through the entire game are experiencing it for the very first time and calling it a new issue. But it's 2019, you can't expect players to go for a sneak attack headshot with their sniper rifle. Get out of here with those discriminatory ableist standards
---
i was expecting deathclaw heads used as shoulder pads.. but this is great too!:D 10/10
---
You make a far point
---
BGS of trolling their players.  Hey lets add a pacifist mode, but make so the pacifists can be trolled and murdered.  
---
If im in pacifist mode, i dont want to hurt players and they shouldn’t be allowed to hurt me plain and simple. 
---
Pacifist mode in 76 should be renamed to get trolled mode.  
---
Fallout 76 "is" region locked, I've bought non-USA keys and I live in the States and resolving that issue took some
---
Clever application of technology
---
Sorry, I thought they were pretty common. I uninstalled.
---
just fyi, that doesn't exist. Two shot and anti-armor are both tier 1 effects, so you can only have one of them on any given weapon
---
Yeah melee weapons are over powered but he probably has a build specifically for pvp.
---
I am divided on human NPC's. On one hand, if done properly I think they would add much needed boost to the game and to the story. However, the problem is, I believe, that the game engine will not allow any level of human NPC's that we want.
---
Other's have mentioned the NPC's from 3, NV and 4, but in an online game we won't get those. We won't have companions, we won't have towns full of NPC's that will welcome us in, tell us stories or provide quests, the NPC's won't be participating in the game with us like defending goodsprings at the start FNV, put it simply it is A. Too difficult to have that level of NPC in an online game and B. The game engine can't do it.
---
Should a human NPC be introduced, I think that they will be nothing more than an non-interactive quest giver which will only anger people more.
---
Tbh, I think Bethesda are in a bind here. In it's current state the game is poor, the DLC's that they can reasonably deliver are not going be of the level that some are hoping for compared to previous Fallout games and ultimately Bethesda are going to have to work out what they're going to do with this game. They've made it online but also made it too single player, but a single player game without the story or character interactivity of previous games which we have all played. 
---
In summary, I think they need to evaluate what they want the game to be to keep people playing, otherwise people will be leaving in droves and I many will be put off when Fallout 5 is announced.
---
Yeah, definitely.  No more powering through it super easy.  Make it so you have to run, dodge, hide, drop more arty, etc.  It could be a fun 20 minute event then :)
---
Er, you were the one that mentioned 24+ on a 76 server.
---
\+1 agree.  
---
I've got an m14 in airsoft, it comes in at 10 pounds, and I certainly couldn't carry it all day in full kit.
---
I'm glad they realized that there was a rmt market for TSE but taking out the explosive perks because of it was atrocious. Then we have the event cooldown going up to 1h 15min.
---
What they want us to do, farm Whitespring and ONLY Whitespring? It's horrible that the only other activity besides SBQ is that place, it's horrible.
---
Personally, I don't care for the perk card system. I don't mind a little difficulty and I don't mind grinding because let's face it most MMOs are mindless grindfests anyway. But I feel like the perk card system is extremely limited. You upgrade a perk card and suddenly you don't have room for it anymore, so you have to abandon a bunch of other cards just to make room. Perks like lockpicking shouldn't need three cards. I thought the idea of switching perks to spice up game play was pretty cool, but if I have a level one lock pick card and a level three, a level three should automatically do the same as the level one and two. Having all three at once takes up valuable space that can be used to swap other perks. Upgrading a perk shouldn't be tedious. I mean, other MMOs don't make you pick between a beginner's level and a expert's level of anything. What sense does it make to be able to open a level three lock but not a level one?
---
It just ruined my enthusiasm for the game for the night tbh. I couldn't even hit him even when I swung half a foot from him directly at him. Am just frustrated I suppose lmao. 
---
May I note that around the two main factories, its all hillside, so you're really looking for a flat spot.
---
Can these be stacked? For example, if I wanted all the xp buffs, would it let me do that or would one buff replace the other?
---
More than likely. All the pistol are poo tier anyway. 
---
I feel like the SMGs are so underrepresented now. They’re just faster firing rifles now, no unique perks or anything. 
---
I’d love like a movement speed perk while holding one, or better recoil control. 
---
Lol alright buddy
---
Griefing is somebody totally going out of their way to continuously cause you grief, they’re maybe an extremely higher level, overpowered, etc, and only have it out for you. They’ll go out of their way and bury themselves and lose it all just to cause you grief. 
---
“Raiding” in this case could mean consensual pvp, or a little fight at a base or even a little hunt, but you gotta have some honor and class, consider caps &amp; resources you could be losing, and weigh out possibilities of going to attack somebody or leaving them be. 
---
Are you gonna just ignore every other point I made about the perks and trophies and just call me an asshole? Lol I’m not gonna apologize for playing the game, I’m sure you feel as strongly about playing it your way as I do my way and I respect that. 
---
Nice work. Play for your enjoyment.
---
I'm 5/8ths of the way through Origins and haven't dusted off Odyssey yet.  I reinstalled my Elder Scrolls, too.  I did a replay of 3, NV, and 4 recently so I'm trying to decide if I need another runthrough.  
---
I second this.
---
You can’t steal anything from anyone’s base... so you are not “raiding” your just destroying the base for no reason... aka you’re griefing... aka you’re an asshole
---
Not attempting to disprove anything, hence why I posted my stats to show someone who wasn't suffering from the issue.  
---
Of all the people who posted that they were having problems that I read, all were well over 20 agility.  Figured I would just throw up some data in case it helped.
---
I had a weird one last night. I was about ready to log and I noticed a 100 cap bounty guy and his no bounty friend not far from my camp. I fast travel nearby to see if I could get a peak at them to see if I felt like I could take them. One of the two of them nearly immediately charges me with a super fast swinging mole miner gauntlet. I barely have time to spin up my minigun and I kill him. I have nearly no health left and as I am running away to recover I must have had the Serendipity animation fire off 7 times in a row. I own that perk but it wasn't equipped. 
---
I can only assume that that was why I didn't die given the drop he had on me. Maybe he had it equipped and Strange in Numbers shared from him to me mistakenly? My shredding minigun and his gauntlet both attack very fast and maybe we were just trading Serendipities until he died.
---
Guess it’s better than protest march which I’ve never been able to get to work.
---
You should edit your post to remind people to like his video. 
---
This is why anti-armor is a desired legendary effect now, you wanna pierce through as much armor as possible, and stack this with a mag that has armor piercing and any perks that have armor piercing, they help lower damage weapons a lot
---
The monorail elevator is another awesome one.  I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find a camp placeable spot at that monorail train stuck up top.
---
That's a good point. But I guess it's no different to people server hopping Phoenix or MODUS trying to find a loose mod. You'd need the perk for that too.
---
You'll always still have the option to trade someone an item for them to mod, this simply gives the option to streamline a process that is too lengthy and random.
---
Maybe tie the bartering to a skill or perk cards, and failure results in a having to take a worse deal or something 
---
Oh Wow! That is hilarious. At least I know now that Bethesda has priority over posts on Reddit. 
---
Can you please give a list of the places to find them? I know the powering up the power plants give them, but is there a less time consuming way to get them?
---
As a new player who struggles to have ammo and med kits so he can roam around the map to do his lvl 9-10 quests I find it hard to believe that the game is even harder after lvl 10+++
---
I'll be showing this to everyone to see what they think.
---
I don't stash much for weapons or armor though. I'd argue 80% of my stash budget is Aid and Junk. I had to turf a lot of aid recently just to make room for some higher level weapons
---
Just a pet peeve about pointing out the obvious.  Also I was a little deep into my meds and apparently quite pissy, in retrospect...  
---
You store aid?! But theres a perk for it...
---
Yeah. We’ve lost quest progress multiple times among my friends, even after the quest log updates to a totally different task. It just happens sometime. Very frustrating. 
---
Seems you get downvoted by casuals ,it's understandable. For me ,that's what killed it. I could deal with TSE nerfs and bugged weapon durability, but the fact that absolutely anyone could get any plan without doing quests/events/trading was just lame to me.There should be at least SOME stuff that's not easy to find.
---
YES
---
You don't get me man, we're forced to play the game for free atoms &gt;:( Jk,People just need something to complain about these days, it helps them blow off some steam.
---
I never said anything about stealing from a base...? Even if I did only thing you could “steal” are from nodes and crops. Did you read anything I said at all? And dude lol you’re kind of a dick for calling somebody just playing a game the way they want to...as I’ve said there are perks that buff damage to structures and other players. There are trophies you can unlock by defeating other players in pvp. 
---
As they’d say in Far Harbor, “you’re just too green for the fog.” 
---
nerfs happen mate. take it from a old mmo player. 
---
Amen to that.
---
Incredible information. Highly indicative of a greater scope about how things got to be the somewhat unplayable way they are. 
---
Ohhh booo. Thank you for the information though!
---
In short: No. 
---
But it’s to reduce lag and improve stability!
---
I appropriate this. I could not remember what or how I had my armor that made it where they Scorched was nothing for me to handle. This must been what it was. Thank you so much. 
---
The defend Grafton Steel Yard workshop quest gave me three waves of anglers, just like you described. Wow!
---
Yeah, but they weren't whining about being banned for duping... because no one was getting banned for duping.  This was a rant about someone pointing out a glaringly obvious fact in what seems to be an attempt to sound intelligent or get votes or whatever the hell motivates forum mites to post this drivel.
---
This, and many players confuse Whitespring with a Forest area because it's right next to it but it's closer to savage divide in enemy levels and quest-wise. Stay in the forest at first is my suggestion.
---
Those who are outraged by it call it "microtransactions" as if they are selling pay-to-win merchandise. I have personally never spent a single dollar in the Atomic Shop, but I got plenty of items from it that I bought from all the atoms given to me through the game.
---
The funny part though is that someone will post an anti-"Atomic Shop" post ranting about microtransactions, and then someone who is obviously as outraged as them gives them Reddit Gold (which is also a microtransaction). Teenage logic though. You can't beat it, only life can.
---
It's because: 
---
"OH MY GAWD THEY ARE CHARGING $5 FOR AN OUTFIT AND I CANT FIGURE OUT THAT I CAN JUST PLAY THE GAME AND COMPLETE CHALLENGES AND GET IT FOR FREE!" 
---
There's a ton of hate for a lot of crazy reasons on this game. I think some is influenced by here and some is influenced by youtubers knocking it. Yet, there are plenty others who just read and stay silent or make positive videos who dont seem to be affected. It's all in your own view of the game. 
---
I find it silly that they complain about the atom shop prices myself. You dont have to pay anything if you dont want to. If you dont like what is in there then dont buy it and wait a week to see if they put a new something in you do like. Problem solved. 
---
All of the whitespring vendors and the train station have a shared pool of 200 caps a day. 
---
I'm going to assume this is hip-firing otherwise the visual is ruined!
---
2 out of 10 times I've actually gotten that trigger properly.
---
Console - Xbox one X
---
Gamertag - sleekstatik
---
Issue 1 - freezing in loading screen
---
Issue 2 - no loot dropped when fighting legendaries
---
Issue 3 - no spawns where gauranteed loot is supposed to spawn.
---
this game isnt an mmo though
---
What would you prefer, letting RNG take the wheel so you could potentially never get the item you were looking for  OR, farm caps for a week.
---
Yeah an extra perk or two for specific weapon types would be really cool and help make builds feel more unique. When I first heard about the hundreds (or whatever the claim was) of unique perks for this game I thought that meant they would go more in depth with perks for weapons. Maybe someday.
---
For smg the vault boy should definitely be dressed as silver shroud tho lol.
---
Hi, what locked door at Watoga train station?
---
God this is so true. I haven't even fucked with Whitesprings because there are always really high level people there. Earlier today there were multiple people over level 200. And I was SO excited to check out WS before 76 came out. I know I could server hop but..... 
---
Thanks! You give me hope. I am not good with audacity either, but your recording sounds dope. 
---
What's frustrating me on my alt is that high levels make level appropriate areas not just spawn enemies but rewards out of level.
---
My biggest issue right now is uranium fever. If I can hit it without a high level nearby it's a good source for low level legendaries. The moment someone else is in the area, the miners crap 35 &amp; 40s, which doesn't really help anyone because they're still too low a level for end game but too high for leveling alts
---
Line in the Sand will net you 2-3 SB.  Other then that just run events and such goes quick.
---
Appreciate the reply, but I don't see any dates anywhere... 
---
Did you sell to the Whitesprings Station vendor?  It uses the same pool as the resort shops.  
---
Honestly, I would love the option to respec on every weekly reset, regardless of changes. That way, you could experiment with all sorts of builds and perks without having to do hours of grinding with only one perk or special per level.
---
Being able to easily change my entire build to try a new weapon, perk, or playstyle would keep the game fresh, and it would mean that I could be less picky with legendary drops. A sick melee weapon while on a rifle build? Now I can keep it until reset and give melee a try instead of having to reluctantly get rid of it to keep weight down.
---
A change like this would open up an endgame of build experimentation and wacky testing without requiring hours of xp farming. It'd be great.
---
The only time I would have bought atoms would have been for the limited time blackbird skin heh (which I missed :( )
---
Shit......well I will have to change  it. Thanks
---
Only one plan isn't going to make a world of difference in your game or the ability to play it. That's just a perception on your part. 
---
I won't even touch lode bearing anymore, one time I didn't make it out because I got turned all around and lost all the junk I had.
---
I've actually been to that wired crazy blown up place. But instead of a sloth I was greeted by a mid level deathclaw. Maybe I should revisit just for the laughs (and the gold. And the crystal.)
---
Hold on....resets it to 200?   So I can sell, buy a Bobby pin, continue selling?
---
“The tools are all there. Our understanding of how to use them, however, is not.” The creators of our perk card and action bar / ability / fav wheel systems. :D 
---
Even MC wasn't hard, you just had to be in a raiding guild (which, again, wasn't hard). I'd love to see wow style dungeons/raids in a game like 76, the current "end game" is beyond trash - so something like that might actually keep people entertained
---
I was in Harper's Ferry the other day doing an Enclave event and a mob of super mutants was glowing red. My teammate and I promptly got our assess kicked and had to respawn. Any idea what makes enemies glow red? I just thought it was a glitch until I saw your post.
---
I especially like the fit gud crowd. As if hitting the an enemy that just rushes right toward you ten times is any harder than hitting it three. I honestly dont think they can read real well.
---
Keep in mind that the nerf also affected many more legitimate players who had a two-shot OR an explosive weapon (not both). Even without both properties, it could be a player’s best weapon, and probably isn’t anymore. 
---
Those are not Armor piercing Explosive rounds, they are ARMOR PIERCING INCENDIARY rounds. As it states in the title of the video.
---
but what if we really enjoy the game? im a sandbox player..i can spend hours server hopping for plans..even if i get none i know how to make the best of the situation by clearing out the enemies while im doing..gaining xp/legendaries/loot..i was a little salty last week due to the patch..but i got over it and now im fine..the thing is ive played other games close to 2k hours and havent got bored with them..so just saying taste is subjective..if u dont like a game after 450 hours..it doesnt mean everyone else feels the same way
---
No doubt. The anti armor dragon I found the other day is probably pretty useful.
---
I can see how this works in Fallout 4 where balance never really mattered......but high ROF weapons can never be good in this game as long as most everything is armored (especially PvP). The formula is strongly weighted in favor of the highest dmg weapons.
---
The atoms they give in the game are crumbs compared to what they cost. People wouldn't have too much of a issue if they were reasonable priced, things that cost 1000+ should be 100+. The time only items where you have less than a day to buy something if you want it gives you no way to actually earn extra atoms easily.
---
Sure you don't have to buy anything but there are things that make your dress and camp look nice. Some of the challenges are so tedious and time consuming. Never mind this week and last they put the same broken challenge for both weeks knowing it is broken. 
---
If people like something they going to have to fork out real dollars .. you guys aren't oblivious to how this works. Also all items mostly are dirty and items in the atom are somewhat cleaner version but also they selling dirty items now. If you going to buy a item from the atom store, it should give you both versions, clean and dirty so you can choose which to use just like FO4, but to sell dirty items that look clean is unacceptable. Or just sell clean items from the atom store and any dirty items should be able to be found in game .. it's really not that hard. It's just nickel and diming when people have paid full price for a game.
---
Honestly, the former. It was working fine for me before. And I never spent time server hopping trying to get just one plan. I played the game, did quests, took workbenches, participated in events, and ended up getting plans I needed.
---
Because I play with friends, we always shared plans we already knew with each other. 
---
You know, took advantage of the whole game, focused on playing it, rather than gaming it. 
---
Or just tie her HP to level player that dropped the nuke.
---
No. Sometimes it glitches out and the vendor _appears_ to have 0 caps. By selling 1 bobby pin (or whatever) it'll show how any caps the vendor really has.
---
Everything else from survival aside, this is what I loved about it. Any Beth game I play, I try and find a “everyone does/takes extra damage on Very Hard” mod. Turns it into actual risk/reward rather than metagame bullshit of “you need one of 3 specific builds to do any damage after cheesing through most of the low level content.”
---
Well, it can. If you want to unlock lots of mods for a certain weapon, one of the best ways is to mass craft then scrap that weapon. I can't believe you are defending this aspect of the game, leaving and joining a game to find a SINGLE plan isn't gameplay, its not fun, and its stupid.
---
This guy gets it
---
 Lol I’ve deconstructed two of those now. Whoops.
---
26 dam is incredibly scary if you are wearing normal armor, and no rad resist perks. I cuts straight to health. My guy has like 280 dam resist in a hazmat but someone with a suped up radium can kill me in seconds flat if I'm not careful. I don't complain, I actually think it's quite fun there are people out there who make specialty builds. It's a fairly hard counter to the upcoming bloodied/unyielding meta.
---
Zero weight crafting materials would literally be a game changer.
---
I understand entirely what you're saying as a day one player myself. But it could also help be alleviated with your build that you currently have.  Leveling and stuff, I personally find having a lot points into strength (I have 15) for the various weight reductions, like Sturdy Frame and Traveling Pharmacy really help with carry weight as well as Thru-Hiker. And also Strong Back is good to take paired with Pack Rat for extra junk/scrap holding to mininize box/bench runs. Can get up to around 290 carry weight by the time you hit endgame, I think max I have hit was 330 with a combo of perks, lot of radiation and chems .
---
There's a build I use and then deviated from once I got more levels and perk cards to play with, found what worked best past the archframe of a group healer with a HUGE backpack:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f29f645&amp;d=sa2sf2p10i12ii0s72c10sb2l22l71cf2ck0cd1a40cc2sv3ik0ej4s61c62cr0ih0ee2pj0&amp;w=&amp;n=The%20Medic
---
Also, with all that Strength and with you mentioning that you have X+ amount of guns/ammo, definitely take a good melee weapon! A close range melee/shotgun combo works well with -maybe- one long range weapon. Most melee weapons are all cheap to repair, deal good damage and will help alleviate having the surplus of guns and ammo. 
---
Hope some, if any of this helped OP or anyone at all!
---
I wouldn't mind it so much if the reward matched the effort.
---
That's not true. You could get plans outside of events and workbenches. I found more plans in random containers, good plans, not ivory handle plans all the time. It's where I found the recipe for Stimpack, barn build, and more. 
---
Idk if you played games pre-micro transactions, but quality content was much more prevalent before micro transactions came out. Micro transactions are code words for “easy to sell cheap digital content that takes very little effort to make” aka shit I don’t care about in the grand scheme of anything. I remember when cosmetics Meant you did something to unlock it, not just merely open your wallet. Not to mention it’s the scummiest form of transactions besides loot boxes, which is the only thing more low. 
---
This...   
---
I get that some are supposed to be rare and some are supposed to be from completing harder quests, but because of the random nature, there are some that you’ll never see.
---
It would be a different story if there was a higher chance to get plans and recipes that you don’t already have than pure random chance with a scarcity modifier. 
---
Haha love the sentiment at the end 👏 
---
It’s their way of keeping you busy . Instead of more quests you get to maintain gear while balancing a weighted inventory &lt;————— that is not why I play fallout quests 
---
That was the first thing I bought with my atoms! I have painted all my PAs with it, but I'm a hoarder, so I only use the Excavator Armor. So, my babies just sit in the stash rotting away...
---
WE WANT BLACKBIRD PAINT FOR THE EXCAVATOR ARMOR, BETHESDA! ERREBODY WANTS IT!!1! THE GAMING COMMUNITY DEMANDS IT, BETHESDA!! ALSO JET PACKS! MORE JET PACKS!
---
I did it once expecting a horde of mirelurk each phase but, as it turned out for me, I ended up having to swim from the island to kill one razor claw to complete each phase and after finishing the event it gave me absolutely nothing. Weird things happen in the wasteland...
---
I still call bullshit on duping without actual proof of duping, but this was damn funny...
---
Oh, crap... I'm here too aren't I.
---
Is this new? I thought the train station vendor was grouped with other train stations...
---
I have a Adrenal/Bloodied melee/pistol/VAT/sneak build and while melee obviously is superior in raw damage, the pistol-sneak-VAT still does comparable damage and is funner to use than melee IMO.
---
I haven't tried Rifle so I don't know about them.
---
OH I don't care. Honestly the idea behind them is ok, it is how it's only a pay thing or save up atoms is annoying. 
---
I don't think they should be meta. They should just be viable. You shouldn't have to feel like a moron for using guns in a game with so many kinds of guns
---
I like that, although the first thing I would do would be to try to get a new low level character through the entire quest line so I could run low level queens. 
---
I've been trying to find a two shot instigating lever action to no avail. Good luck with your hunt!
---
I think if you max out fix it good, power patcher and the weapon one getting you to 200% durability things are less tedious to repair.  Then having the white Knight to reduce the mats needed to repair has me now swimming in ballistic fiber. All of these I only equip in camp and it seems to be a good balance of reducing repair tedium without taking away from other skills needed out in the world.  Granted you may need to get to level 100 before you feel you can get those, it's something to work towards that feels like a win.  And there aren't enough of those things in the game yet.
---
I dont know man, I don't have a problem finding ballistic fibre, I usually have to sell it to vendors because it takes up too much room in my stash. And ammo? Pretty easy to do a quick steel/lead farm and have a hefty surplus of bullets using ammosmith and super duper. Sounds to me like you just need to git gud
---
Right. It's like, great, everyone will just cap farm and buy what they want. Even with the vendor cap at 200, I could easily make lots of caps in a week. 
---
Thanks,i edited my post to include exploring too.Now you can get everything without exploring, doing quests/events or trading.
---
[http://i.bittwiddlers.org/LX5.jpg](http://i.bittwiddlers.org/LX5.jpg)
---
Yeah power armor really shuts that strat down. 
---
Can you elaborate? What does "play bloodied" mean?
---
Fix the bugs. Hands down. What is the point of new content if its not playable?
---
I have over 500 hours and still loving the game. Dont put all us no-lifers in the same basket :)
---
I think it helps that I have horrible luck. Have still not found a single weapon that I actually want for any of my characters. 
---
Where is that?  I looked the other day and couldn't fine it.
---
Guns weigh far too much, and do far too little damage.
---
Every time I see folks talking about how they hate the changes I always get a slight chuckle because the changes rarely affect me. Now hear me out. I don’t use any legendary weapons, because I’ve never got one as a drop. I’m not actively seeking them. I’m using a standard suppressed lever action rifle and a gauss rifle. I’m a stealth sniper build, lever action for close combat, gauss for long range. I can one-shot just about anything in the game, and have killed the SBQ twice since the latest update. 
---
I’m not here to brag about that, I know it seems that way... my point is that everyone seems really upset about losing something I’ve never had and never needed. Sure TSE weapons were very powerful before, but I’m doing fine without having ever had one. I guess what I’m saying is that I’m confused about why people don’t just try different character builds... 
---
Idk, my comment is kinda pointless. I don’t even know what I’m trying to say. Maybe I did just come here to brag. Will probably delete. If you’re reading this I hope you’re having a good day. 
---
So you think maybe if we fast-travel back to the bunker where we left off, the transponder there might actually work?  That would be a huge relief!
---
Might have to try that next time!
---
Mid 30's for me.  Crit a wing with something or kill the scorched minions for it to land, then just run up and murder it in cqb.  Keep pounding a wing and you have a good chance of killing it before it takes off again.
---
Or just run like hell until it rubber bands back it's zone.  They will occasionally drop a neat plan, however it's a waste of ammo with no SAM site to leverage.
---
I completely disagree. I'm a rifle build and I can also one shot things without effort. I easily put out 1200- 1500 damage with my ranged weapons . Even more with chems, and more with a bobblehead[ which I normally dont use ] .  SBQ is still fairly simple with adequate players. And the SB can be taken outta the sky in 5 shots or less before a melee player even has a chance to touch it. 
---
Errr.. Sorry Negan 😁
---
I have a giant tower of campfires punctuated with corn and mutfruit. Those two at least sit perfectly on the camp fire with no gap. 
---
I use it as a giant advertising pillar so players can see it a ways off in case they need a workshop or food or water.
---
Well this was a crappy way to find out. 
---
Dont even have to do that, close its menu and reopen it and it should refresh the caps 
---
I've been hoarding plans and recipes for a while in hopes to make alot of caps when they implimented player vending. Instead they give all plans out. That's fine. A workaround I discovered is there are other games on my PC.
---
That makes me sad.  I feel like FO4 never did that to quest progress - you could save and quit anytime you want.  FO76 leaves too much to risk with the possibilities of server crashes or network difficulties.  I've lost my own loot bags after death more than once because the server died!  Now I can also lose hours of quest work?
---
You can’t have two shot and instigating combo in one weapon
---
(Those are primary effects meaning you can only have one or the other)
---
I can't believe that you want me to believe that the game all hangs on having one plan or whatever to be playable. It doesn't. 
---
It's your own thinking that makes it seem like having that one plan is all important. It's not. It's simply not.
---
The only type of player that thinks like that, are the ones that want to make sure that nothing is a challenge in the game. These are the players that read what others do, then follow those directions and never learn anything for themselves in the game.
---
Why even bother playing a game if you are just doing what other people do and tell you. Talk about mindless. 
---
That's not game play, it's not fun, and it's stupid to just do what others tell you is the best way. 
---
And here is me waiting, for the game to eventually get sorted out with patches so I can finally buy the game!
---
It looks like every patch is 1 step forward 2 steps back, I don’t know if I will ever buy this game at this rate...
---
Having serum plan is far from equal to getting mutation through radiation.   Serum is end game.   Price is fine.
---
Mutation is random.   Serum is not.  Saves lots of time and pains of losing other valuable mutations.
---
Reusing serums mean no negative impacts at all without wasting 3 perks of luck.
---
Far different.
---
Where?
---
All I want is a private server with console commands
---
This comment is a grammatical cluster fuck
---
Well some of us don't have anyone to share plans with  /tear
---
What ever happened to unlocking cosmetics by completing  hard to achieve things that grant cosmetics exclusive to people able to do those challenges. Is it considered a challenge to open your wallet now in games? Or is it a challenge just to do dailies? Not really. It’s the over simplified games and the fact that they use micro transactions to milk more money out of a game rather then create quality content with what was made that drives people to wanna achieve difficult things in the game. Instead they just take the cop out greedy way and just sell it for $$$. Yea sure you get atoms for free, but I’d much rather see those daily challenge let you buy things not cosmetic that way there’s a reason to do them in my eyes.  I’d just rather see more meaningful content then atom shop content, and if most gamers had their way, no game would have any micro transactions, and everything would be earned off gameplay. And not just random challenges like “gain a level” lmao 
---
goodbye letter INC &gt;:( GIVE US BLACKBIRDS OR GIVE US DEATH!
---
That has nothing to do with the vaults and instead grants access to the presidential suite in the Enclave bunker. Which currently can be accessed via glitching through the door to it. Which has a terminal that allows presidential seals to be traded in for special all black Presidential X-01 paint and a few weapon skins. 
---
Most players agree that the feature should already exist, as something you can activate on the condition that you then have to wait to do it over again for an interval. 
---
I feel like changing the duplicate card thing to just give us the next level up, and a function to store any cards we don’t have an ongoing use for equipping should come first. I would have a lot more fun in the game with these two strictly ui changes to perks. 
---
I only keep large amounts of the junk regularly used for repairs. Springs, gears, screws etc. 
---
Everything else I bulk and sell. I'm never gonna use 500 bone shards or glass
---
how many hours are you at if you dont mind me asking?
---
i was saying i was "really enjoying the game and i dont see where all the hate is coming from" when i was around 100 hours. it took time and experience to change my mind. 
---
This. One thousand times this. 
---
The successful MMOs have opened up test servers and rewarded players for filing bugs. Many hands make for short work an all that.
---
Buddy found one of those freaky ass white head masks with the dick nose and an outfit of old ratty pinstriped pants and suspenders... follows around noobs repeating "....Moist..."....

&gt;Okay hold up, within the few hours ive spend wandering. Im finding this to be a bit BS. Your whole new account doesn't help your case in any way you put it. Now to go under the image provided below and your only suggestion of "Middle of the map", this body of water must be a puddle or a small ass connecting river to the rivers that are shown on the map. Along with the fact I dont know what the OP constitutes as a factory, but the only real Factories per say, that's within the middle of the map and in a colorful forest (IE The Forest area), would be Arktos Phrama, Mama Dolces, and I would call a stretch to inlcude Tygart Water and Monangah Power. Searching the areas around these provide jack diddly squat in terms of bodies of water. Ive strolled around the barren parts the Divide nothing even looked close never mind the fact its all dark autumn colored.

The 50 cal sniper that the military uses, the M107 aka Barrett, weighs just under 30lbs, with no ammo loaded. 
---
And the M2 weighs over 80 lbs!
---
It's funny that the M2 and MK19 (the auto grenade launcher) in this game weigh what? 20lbs?
---
I had to farm Glasses Caverns because Scorched are the few things that can die to peasant, nonlegendary weapons that are not bullet sponges (Robots, Bears, Super Mutants, Mirelurk are out of the question) and it has the largest concentration of them.
---
You get to loot some expensive junk stuff from the Mirelurk Queen and Fog Crawlers which can be sold to vendors for minimal profit (I learned to play other games while waiting for the dumb as hell vendors to reset). Oh and besides having a shit ton of scorched, the place does not spawn legendary versions of them because fuck exploration, Whitespring us where the fun is at.
---
Lol 85 shots? Your joking right? 
---
Only the game is completely playable if you don't have a specific plan. It's just that simple. 
---
It's simply perception that the game isn't playable without a certain plan. 
---
The only people i see still doing pvp on pc are f*ckheads who have one guy get a bounty and his 3 buddys are hiding in the bushes with explosive weapons. I just play passive now. Specifically IGN rickdias3rd and csersnake
---
Someone in the comments of that thread posted a pic. These that you listed are easy to find. I have them all. I want what i can't have lol
---
I bought an Xbox One to play RDR2 and FO76. So far I now play RDR2, FIFA 19, GTA V. I no longer play FO76, which was the main reason I bought it. All my friends that played it stopped as well, and just one guy left to play with. 
---
do do that quest, started in the vault. then get the quest "presidential seal" then get to enter the whitesprings thing and get the skins. 
---
Which is great because it makes it a quest that is only worth doing one time. 
---
microtransactions don't have to be pay to win to be called that.
---
They are microtransactions, you pay to get a little something in a game that isn't real content, that's what microtransactions are.
---
Now yes, most of the atomic shop is shit and you get a good amount of free atoms, but that doesn't suddenly make them not be microtransactions because not everybody will pay for them.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that. The things these people have to put up with...
---
Bummer, sorry to hear.  I know there have been some recent problems but don't remember the details.  My rifle main was the one I described, but I also have a pistol only alt at level 50 now, with the same perks and mutation, and the full Mistress of Mystery set which enhances the stealth.  No armor ever. Challenging but totally viable, did fine with the SBQ the other night.  Just starting a shotgun build now, not want melee either.
---
Have you tried your character without the chameleon armor? Perhaps we can set our characters to the same build/equipment and compare.  What platform you on?
---
I'm old enough to have played video games in the 80s. :)
---
I'm not a "conformist," I get the criticism of microtransactions, but I would only agree with the criticism if the game forces you to buy items that is necessary for game-play. If it's a cosmetic item, then meh.
---
My water farm near deathclaw island pumps out an absolute ton of water.

6 industrials + 6 smalls

Aim for the eyes, it will stagger them. 
---
Even enforcer rank one turns shotguns into shredders for robots.
---
If you're melee.... Idk have fun lol. Their ballistic gun is armor piercing.
---
The game isn't scaled for single player. Some quests they just throw 50 super mutants at you at once. I have my rifle perks maxed out. It's just not that fun to shoot the same idle thing over and over again. It's mind numbing. 
---
Have you tried making friends? 
---
It’s become fucking mandatory busy work.
---
I start playing the same way all the time now.
---
-Spawn, 
---
-scrap junk from last play session and fix all weapons, including the fucking plasma Gatling that breaks after a single fight
---
-SELL EVERYTHING I have collected during last play session to at least 3 different vendors.
---
-buy shit I need, usually more scrap
---
-fast travel to camp to kill food, collect food, and water. Then boil/cook and prepare. 
---
-manage to get carry weight down so I can wear excavator and have about 50lbs to pickup junk 
---
-leave for a quest or Event and gather more junk. 
---
-repeat 
---
This daily grind just to leave for a quest or event takes easily 1.5 hours. 
---
Everything breaks too fucking much now, and I literally have to carry 20 pounds of water and food to keep out of the red. 
---
about 300
---
I think it kind of backfired on me.  Seeing all the plans on offer made me realize I simply don't care about the vast majority of them, which in turn makes everything feel even more pointless than it already does.
---
Just make it so anyone under 50 cannot damage the queen at all.    No loot or XP.
---
Gamefly is selling their used copies for $27 on both PS4 and Xbone I believe.

No, you also have to spend the points to buy cards and repeat buy lower levels if you want a 2 or 3 now instead of the 5 or whatever. The game should already have a start over for the level ups that you cannot spam, perhaps require you to level up 8 times to earn the next one. Whatever standard was used to decide perk pack timing. Cash in two packs or something. 
---
Well, I couldn't convince any of my IRL pal's or mmo pals to buy the game lol. As  far as new friends, its been a slow but steady process. I enjoy teaming up but I do my best to not over stay my welcome.
---
With any luck stealth is just straight-up broken right now, and hasn't been actually nerfed on purpose.
---
I’m glad it’s just cosmetic (mostly don’t forget items that have built in perks for hp now) but like I said, I’d rather be challenged to earn something rather then see cheap shit like this quickly monitored instead. Also, I feel like the money spent on atom shop shit would be better spent on even a single dev to help the abomination the game is right now. I’m sure you have seen the quality of games decline especially in the last 10 years when things should be advancing the most. 
---
Yeah. Just need the 100 power generator. 
---
It runs my whole water farm.
---
You're boring!
---
They think the developers are having guys work on the atom shop items instead of fixing bugs and stuff. I think most people don't know that the people working on textures and models for the atom shop can't just switch over to coding and fix how events work, or balance weapons, or add qol fixes to the game. It's a different department. The teams are full of just enough employees to work on the game as decided by the boss(es), and they have to work with that. They wont just lay off the 3d artists and hire more coding grunts until things are working better, top brass wont fly that!
---
The developers aren't in charge, it's not a groups of friends who are all pitching ideas over beers after hours, figuring out how to best allocate manpower to get the game running better. It's like any other job, they gotta listen to the execs or put their livelihood(jobs) at risk.
---
You have to power the terminal, then connect the terminal to the keypad not the pylon. Power items have two places to attach a wire. Took me a bit to figure out opening 3 garage doors with a terminal. 
---
It's just a specific example. The post is more of a general issue regarding dealing with inflation. You could say the same about fully kitting out your PA with mods or getting the neon signs plan or the like.
---
Similar problem but I can't think of pricing as egregious as the serums. From memory, I don't even think jetpack plans cost that much. 
---
Someone already made a sheet for all the weapons +mods

---
I still think the game has potential, and still say it's pretty much what I expected. But you're right. It's just... getting stale, far quicker than it should be. 
---
I will say that placing your fun factor in the hands of a TSE weapon was probably a bad idea. They were rapidly exposed as seriously OP even without the shotgun factor.
---
Maybe take the ceiling of highest level player with a kill in silo then?  At this point Id just be happy with no HP scale.  I can't kill it if more then one other shows up.  
---
? i notice it stores them when you store all junk now maybe thats what you mean
---
Here’s a detailed map of what vendors are connected.
---
http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-vendor-map-2.jpg
---
I think the difference is that melee in general does require much effort to output more damage. I've seen more ways to increase melee damage then rifle damage.
---
But I agree with the right kind of build you can output adequate damage with rifles - but it takes much less effort to output just as much melee damage
---
You do make some good points but it seems like you came to argue. If you check my comment history You’ll see that I’m an asshole not worth arguing with, but I came here to say this:
---
I hope you’re having a good day OP. That is all
---
&gt;Additionally the files are set up in a way; generally that '76 can handle a FO4 file, but FO4 can't handle a '76 file
---
would that be because of the "upgrades" and such on the engine (simply incompatible)? or is it some protection build in?
---
and okay,... i figured they would be transfered pretty easy tbh
---
are VATS related perks any good really? i have tried a few on my lvl 170 main, but I end up barely ever using VATS at all...
---
Buddy, he says in the post he hasn't had a one shot weapon. His problem is he can't even kill an enemy 25 lvls below him I  less than 5 shots haha. 
---
username checks out. [james, were going to piss test you when you get into the office tomorrow]
---
I thought I was the only one! 
---
It's such easy caps from vendors and a few players know they can stock up in bulk on the cheap so they seek me out. 
---
I run on the junk pile south of death claw island. Bonus junk. Bad for fast travel. But great for H20 and junk

When you take a serum it negates the negative effects of the mutation for an hour I believe. I think I read the positive effect is also enhanced during this time, I didnt bother checking last time I took one so I cant confirm that part.
---
Regardless, if you are able to craft your own mutations you could save yourself 3-5 perk points while also having less negative effects and possibly more positive. So its actually a great end game goal, just poorly gated behind absurdly low drop chance and equally absurd cap cost if you buy them.
---
Yeah he sucks
---
Props for going with a pistol build - I went with rifle for most of the game until I got past 50 and switched to melee. I think sneak builds a re great, but it is dependent on sneaking which doesn't always work as expected in the game's current state.
---
why are you complaining about a random stranger logging random strangers complaints and complaining about it? get a life. 
---
Playing at low hp all the time to do maximum damage with "bloodied" legendary weapons. On low hp you also trigger some additional perks and the perk+legendary damage increase is (was, I don't know if developers "fixed" it as I haven't been playing for a month or so) fantasic. 
---
I think this is right on the money. Movement, aiming, glitch NPC movement, hitboxes, are all too awkward and boxy feeling. Then there's the very limited weapon range.. However I'd still prefer more effective damage in/out, it would make every encounter more interesting if winning was not possible just standing out in the open and DPS everything before they DPS you.
---
Imagine if the combat was as smooth as Battflefield, Far Cry, or COD. This game would be so good.
---
You gotta say it..
---
Hey you kids get off my lawn!
---
That would work, too. 
---
the game ones look way cooler than the made up pile of shadows and nothing that spooked some kids in the woods once, so I think they did ok.
---
yes. make it a struggle. people deposit all their junk before starting the event because they know the chance of death is high.
---
How dare you question Bethesda.
---
I have speed demon and because of this i go through ALOT of water. I dont have enough purified so i resort to boiled or dirty. These give me rads, because of that i am out of radaway. No i am stuck at 75% of my health being taken up by rads and i cant repair my combat armour either! The lv 68 ghouls also do 140 rads when their charred hands hit you, and again no radawy.
---
Duplicates are the worst element of an awesome system here and the fix for them is mind numbingly uncomplicated. Give us the next level up card instead of a second one of the lowest level. Let us store the unneeded cards of our choosing, SO WE SELECT THE CARDS THAT ARE DEPLOYED FOR AVAILABILITY TO EQUIP JUST LIKE WE SELECT WHAT ITEMS TO CARRY AND WHICH TO LEAVE IN THE STASH
---
Only energy weapon worth using is the Tesla rifle, it’s a great “I’m in a low level area and don’t want to waste my good stuff on trash mobs” weapon. Decent damage+arcing between enemies+arcing off the ground into enemies
---
Melee is overpowered, it scales off strength and with a perfect endgame build you can get rediculously high strength talking like 35 strength not including strength based melee perks, with around 100% armor pierce on the right legendary weapons, with extremely high base damage and the fact that Power armor buffs that damage. Now with the nerfs to explosive two shot it is the only way to play and deal consistently high damage. 
---
As someone who finds melee's boring, at level 130 I am not playing till they buff guns or remove their nerfs because if I wanted melee weapons I would just go play skyrim. The actual difference between melee and guns is too much. They are forcing people to play a certain way in a game that is supposed to be without a general meta. Everything should be viable but with how tanky the scorchbeasts and supermutants are compared to their damage output, and the sheer fact that sneak isn't viable outside pvp, it is not even close. 
---
TBF a twenty pound Combat Rifle isn't that far off from a real world Browning Automatic Rifle. And the Assault Rifle is woefully underweight, its Water jacket with water in it should be at least another 25 lbs.  
---
anything chambered for .50 should weigh at least 30 lbs like an barrett m82
---
If you actually take time to wander around and explore and follow some of the story, it takes about two months :)
---
ON SALE 33% off! only 1800!
---
Why is it that when I buy 50 caps worth from a vendor, his caps increase by 5 or something? I think that is dumb.
---
My melee character walks round with a combat knife and a cultists blade, both vampiric. They are the most end game weapons I have found for my melee character. Far superior to any two handed weapon in terms of DPS. Yes a super sledge can one hit kill a high level enemy, I can stab that same enemy 4 times, kill them and be halfway through killing the next before that super sledge has finished swinging.
---
I can solo a silo without power armour with those two blades in hand. If the buggers ever land I can kill a scorchbeast before they take off again.
---
Basically just saying that with the right legendary  fast melee weapon you can outperform the larger, slower melee weapons.
---
This is not to argue with your post, just to point out that there ARE end-game melee weapons that aren't two handed.
---
Yeah, they just doing weird thing with sneak , but of course they change stuff all the time without listing it as changed. Plenty of rage about that lol
---
From my experience with them, I believe it is very likely that if you go there, you should be able to play the last message and it will advance the quest to have you go find the next one. Not a 100% promise, but I do think it will work. 
---
Are you going after the low hanging fruit workshops. Big chungus level 100 strolling in and  murdering a couple of level 10s?
---
This is all tru
---
I love PvP and I would love to play more PvP in FO76. The problem is that the PvP is just not fun (yet). The wanted system discourages PvP so much that its better to walk around in pacifist mode. The HvH mode is a joke. Its over in seconds and then you have to queue again at wich point no one wants to. The weapon balancing is bad. 
---
There is no point in playing PvP. TF2 has more fun custom free for all modes than FO76. Im excited that Bethesda wants to do something about it. The survival servers are a great first step. I hope it comes with a bunch of good features, or a lack of them(looking at wanted system here) to encourage PvP play and make PvP fun.
---
The lack of PvP is not because of the playerbase imo. Its because the PvP itself is bad. 
---
Bethesda has always had balancing issues, take s skyrim for example, it's annoying because you work your ass off making a build only for enemies to level up with you making you feel like nothing has changed not to mention magic is a waste because it becomes irrelevant at higher levels because you can't boost it through enchanting or potions 
---
Mine has been triggering in power armor.... More here recently. Idk why
---
To be blunt the damage was not balanced per release.   Even post "nerf" both two shot and explosive are better then most other weapon perks.  It invalidated any challenge with pretty much any content in the game so something had to give.
---
The TSE thing was just folks abusing unbalanced stuff and fully building around it.  Or folks pissed because they paid IRL money to buy god roll's that do a fraction of the damage now.
---
This. Also unyeilding gear and Nerd Rage goes great with it.
---
Just use the One Tamriel scaling from Elder Scrolls Online. That changed the game for the better
---
It's certainly not as effective as lighter armor, but with a full sneak build, it's viable still.
---
I'm a sneak sniper build, and I sneak around nuked Watoga and SBQ in power armor, due to the radiation. Enemies will detect me more often and more quickly, but not quick enough to make a difference to the outcome.
---
I wouldn't be against that.
---
No, its that people believe the game should be of a certain standard i.e. working / less buggy than what it currently is. It's got nothing to do with teenage logic as you put it.
---
Bethesda should worry about the game more than the Atomic shop.
---
Nice one, cheers 😁👍
---
I believe they're talking about using weapons that have the "Bloodied" legendary prefix, which makes the weapon do more damage if you're low on health. So you deliberately hover around a low health value in order to get a big damage boost, but at the cost of having to be much more careful about getting hit.
---
Can be paired with "Bolstering" or "Unyielding" armor pieces, which also give you a bonus when your health is low.
---
I had the same issue a while ago. I had to log out and do the training over again to complete it. 
---
give it another 100 hours. 
---
My bad, I should have clarified that. 
---
I get why killing low levels would induce rage and anger, but I’m looking for a real challenge, and I’ve actually made friends this way but very rarely. It’s actually high levels that get the most pissed off. 
---
But doing quests/events/trading/exploring is how you get the caps to buy the plans.
---
It's most likely random. A lot of in-world (ie: not on vendors) plans/mods are random.
---
Thanks for posting this
---
For what it's worth, the Animal Friend perk affects scorchbeasts as of the last patch. If you have a few spare perk points, it could save you a bit of time and stimpaks. I don't doubt that'll get patched back out at some point, though. More of a temporary solution.
---
I'm my experience power armor is more of a hindrance in pvp. I can one shot most people in power armor with my sniper build and you loss all the legendarie effects your armor has if your in it. Best bet is to hunt for some good legendary gear if you are looking to pvp. That's my opinion anyways 
---
I can help if you are on xbox
---
Yes We must shush in case of overlords
---
Because the PvP mechanic surrounding Workshops is poorly explained.  All an opposing player needs to do to instigate PvP at a Workshop is stand near it, and then they have free reign to kill the other player.
---
IMO, the onus should be on the current owner to instigate PvP.  If they want to fight back and secure their Workshop, then they will logically need to engage their opponent.  Otherwise, it will just transfer to the opponent.
---
The demolitions nerf was still uncalled for and no one can convince me otherwise. TSEs needed a smack down but they caught a perfectly fine class of weapons in the crossfire and it smells like incompetent development tactics. Using explosives is not an IWIN button, it takes a ton of resources and kit burden on top of the 11 or so perks needed just to make something go boom occasionally.
---
I've never even held a TSE or even explosive legendary weapon so I have no idea what the difference is on that end, I just know that the explosives I carried for that extra war machine flavor are even less niche and even more garbage.
---
i wouldnt have checked your history unless you told me to, but tbh dude, you sound like someone who hasnt been playing for very long. give it time. 
---
i miss the early days before everyone had legendaries... the pvp in the beginning was so much fun, fighting one person for a solid 5 minutes before one of you dies... good times. 
---
now its see an enemy, point, shoot, loot bag. and you spend less than 1 minute actually engaged in pvp.
---
Good to know. Thanks my dude
---
So you’re after something you aren’t describing very well... you may want to give a description beyond “jumpsuit” if you want further help.
---
I agree 100%. We need this qol. Lost my 3 star swing speed super sledge a few days ago. No clue what happened to it either.. sigh
---
I’m not, PS4. I just don’t even know what they are. My own stupidity. Are they under the power connectors section? Are they a plan (I’ve got the advanced plans)?
---
Saddly I didnt have 4 hours to do so
---
I sort of agree yes. I enjoy joining randoms when I do the SBQ since I love my rifle build and I don't want to break character just to melee the SBQ. So I crit shoot the wings and as soon as it lands the melee builds wack it. Lots of fun to date.
---
I also enjoy joining randos in events in general so good combo for me but there may come a day where I will need to solo the SBQ due to players moving on or just choosing not to join my event.
---
My copy of FO76 will just be collecting dust till they get their shit together.  
---
At least the downtime lead me to rediscover Xenoverse 2...
---
Both perks are still more useful, or flat out better, then most legendary weapon perks though.
---
No when I add a mod to a weapon that’s already modded.  Used to let you move them around to other builds.
---
When psn gives a free game is it free to play for that month or is it yours forever?
---
Yeah i stopped playing, the game forces you to take a bunch of weight perks, then you dont do any damage and are using a bunch of different guns because you dont have ammo, because you have to shoot everything 100 times, and you can't craft ammo because you can't stock up on material and junk just running around because you are always overweight from carrying so many different guns. Not to mention all the perks you need for everything. Its a shame but i dont see myself ever finishing this game unless they come out with an offline mode where you can turn off all this fake progression and limitations. 
---
One of the tips on the ingame loading screen says that marine armor is second only to power armor, but I have no clue what the exact stats are.
---
&gt; They don't PLAY the game.
---
Why would Bethesda test their own games? They've become accustomed to their loyal stable of modders patching their games for them.
---
Normally I would go on a killing spree at watag, or any place that had an abundance of robots, using melee of course. But when I came across that lucky hole mine was shocked at how much lead I came out with.
---
No plans spawn, you can't get mods from scrapping them as far as I know (scrapped a dozen, no mods), and there are very few spawn points in the map, only 3 that I know of.
---
That being said, the mods are super cheap at the watoga vendors, you can get dual blade or long bow bar blade and a flamer for the "scope" section of it.
---
Omg, I happened to move a couple teddy bears that my daughter likes to look at into my walking inventory from my camp stash so I cant auto scrap without losing them. I have been manually scrapping stuff since 1/28 or so.  Super glad I read this!
---
"HERE WE GO! EPIC ENCOUNTER! OH HO, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY. THIS IS GREAT! YEA-.... the fuck.... WHERE ARE YOU..."
---
It's like when the Scorchbeast lands that ONE TIME- and you can deal big damage... then it takes off and disengages, and flies off.
---
daily "feelsbadman" should be something you earn atoms for....
---
I spent way more time in the forest and toxic valley then I probably should have I was level 80 befor I really started to explore the other areas and I still haven't spent much time in the ash heap and I'm over 140 now.
---
Workshops, place your camp at a aluminum deposit, just raid either workshop deposits or just general deposits as you exploring. Also lots of veins. I don't tend to have a issue with aluminum I find lots of it but also probably don't use it that much. of course aluminum cans, not the dirty ones, the shiny ones area good source, the others are for lead.
---
As long as you’re subscribed to PSN it’s free forever.   If you let it lapse, you lose the license until the account is active again.   I’ve still got a few from last year I have t tried yet.  You just have to download it during the free month.  After that you can delete it and download again anytime.
---
No, it's not that station, it's just that some plans are guaranteed and some aren't. Though even the ones that seem to have a higher chance of coming up.
---
It's probably next, going to meltdown then.  No hope of balancing until.they do though.
---
Its stops right as you run out of ammo. So almost instantly.

Despite what the loading screen tip says, Marine Armor is absolutely not "second to Power Armor."  BoS Combat Armor is better, simply by virtue of capping out at Lv. 50 instead of the Lv. 45 that Marine Armor does.
---
While we on this subject. How about plans for tomahawks? Anyone seen these? I could have sworn I or a friend found one in the beta. Haven't seen one since launch. 
---
[reminds me of this fellow](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/clint-eastwood-gran-torino-gif-1.gif)

That's awesome, thanks for letting me know!
---
Are there any plans to introduce humanoid NPCs and maybe like a hub for each faction? Everyone wants NPCs. Also any plans to fix pacifist mode so we can't just be grief murdered?
---
I'm crying for your Bears :(( We should have been given display shelves for everything we find, even if they become locked and non retrievable, so much that was fun Fallout 4 could have been included. Displaying find and trophys give a sence of progression and satisfaction in the game. 
---
It's as if BGS are perversely *wanting* to kill the franchise, for everyone to hate the game so they can kill it.
---
Totally agree that this would be a better system, but I also kind of like the feeling of danger I get when I’m messing around with my own workshop. I actually blueprint defensive structures for this and is a fun part of my game at least. Capture the shop then drop an appropriate structure that will protect me from a stealth attack.
---
But I get what you mean here. Having a box pop up that says “Contest” or “Surrender” would be more consensual...but hell this is already one of the most consensual PvP systems in places other then workshops.
---
Yeah I get that too sometimes with fusion cores. I went to put on one a frame and it appeared to add six. But I closed and went back and just one was there. Basic Bethesda bugs I guess.

Should just make all the weight reducing perks you own apply to your stash box, regardless if you have them equipped or not.
---
Wind chimes. A lot of places have them, and you can hear when one is near. They give 1-3 aluminium and you'll find them just by doing normal adventuring.
---
We already have interactable NPCs. All the vendors, quest giving robots and Grahm fit this category. The differences between a “flesh” NPC and a “robot” NPC amount to very little. Lack of human NPCs is a design choice, not an engine restriction. They could do it this very day if they wanted to.
---
Yep, +15 if it's just you.
---
Marine armor in fallout 4 was a beefed up version of combat armor so it was second to power armor, but In this game they made it worse than heavy combat armor in damage and energy resistance, but it gives a bit of rad resistance which isn't really worth it.  Currently heavy combat would be the best for all around protection, heavy leather for energy which is important during scorchbeast fights, and heavy metal is really good if your fighting things that shoot at you.
---
Which are?
---
looks fucking awesome, bought it. Sucks that you cannot use it on unique .44 or the western 44... bethesda, please
---
I run a stealth build and ran into the ammo factory while someone was clearing the mobs. As soon as it was capable I spent the caps and started the capture process. The guy just left. Didn't try and fight me. I was hoping for some pvp. We where close enough in level so I thought he would fight back.
---
Where do I get the plans for that? Also, even if combat armor is the best, isn't it surpassed by heavy leather? because of the reasons I said about? It has much higher energy resistance to metal armor as far as I know but I don't know anything about bos
---
ah dysentery... my old friend. It was a lonesome 10 minutes without you...
---
I'm sorry but how is that helpful? I literally said that in my post
---
It becomes more and more evident that Bethesda's B-Team over at the Austin studio shouldn't have made this game alone.
---
Looks really cool! Good job! 
---
Really need to start being more observant! 😒😂
---
Unique you mean Legendaries? And totally agree I wanted it to work so bad for my western revolver.
---
I've only had the TSE weapon for relatively short while, given to me by someone who had upgraded to something better.  And yes, the TSE weapon made the game funner, because I spent less time worrying about getting executed by wandering baddies and more time exploring and questing.  Nothing I did boosted my damage output enough to match pace with on-level mobs.
---
Now I'm back in that same boat, and if I wanted to re-spec for melee, that's at least another 20-30 levels to move points and acquire perks - in other words, more grinding.

---
FYI, moving camp shifts all stuff to to stored at 100% health.  Way less expensive to recoup a few dozen caps then a mountain of scrap for me.
---
I agree that it doesn’t prevent you from playing the game and completing the quests.  
---
However, it does make certain parts more enjoyable.  The point of playing a game is to have fun.   
---
And nothing prevents you from not buying from the vendors.  If you want to discover them organically, then go for it.   It’s all in how you play...
---
Yes, it sucks for the people who were taking advantage of some of the scarcity to foster their own economy, in game or out.  But like an economy, everything can change in an instant and you either adapt or die.   And it’s this faction that I think that most of the complaint are coming from...
---
also, about arguing... i didnt start it. they did. im right, they are wrong, and if they dont agree i expect a better response than the bot-like disney world response... "hO hO, DiDkNeE LuNd dOnT wErk LiKe mA Pa, FiRd DeA oUt... Ho hO. Me PeE tAsTe LyK fAnTa!"
---
when you find out that bethesda has over 100 employees who are actively commenting on reddit posts and facebook posts and shit like that to do damage control[and then you find out that part of their script is to use the disney land arguement] you get pretty frustrated. who is the sheep who is just repeating what the bethesda employee said, and who is the bethesda employee? who are the genuine yay-sayers? theres no way to tell, so i argue with them. i feel like everyone should call people out who use the disney arguement, just because its now a known part of their script. any corporate employee whois paid to post on reddit shouldnt be allowed to post. but hey, thats a whole can of ethics right there. 
---
It all comes down to negligence. Nothing was well-thought out. Whatever the problem, at the root they just didn't devote enough time and/or resources to do everything right, so a lot of things were done wrong. I'm thinking the whole idea was pitched as an easy way to get ongoing revenue by running a game "service", and they could just recycle most of the fo4 content and engine so there was really minimal development cost to do it. 
---
Except they just didn't pull it off the way that they had planned. They didn't throw enough resources at it, and when it came ship time they had a barely functional project with a ton of bugs and missing a bunch of obvious features that anyone playing the game for a week could have thought of. "Oh Energy Weapons? I guess we should throw them in there, but no time to test any of them"
---
Have y’all never played an MMO-like game before? Time-sinks are part of the package. I don’t know what you were expecting

the same things the 9 cans hanging from a string or whatever
---
In certain situations (i.e. energy-based enemies like robots or the Scorchbeast), Heavy Leather might work better.  But Heavy Combat Armor is more all-purpose and balanced.
---
Many players have asked where the BoS plans are now.  Prior to Patch 5, they used to be available at the two vendors in Grafton and the BoS vendor in Watoga.  Since Patch 5, I think the consensus is that there's no straightforward way to get them now.
---
So much anger 
---
I hate the grinding and I hate the bullet sponges. It's honestly a load of tedious trash and Bethesda better fix it. 
---
I have had loot not loading good past few days
---
I'll have to take the time to watch this video. I've been wanting to bui
---
That one is just fuckin bugged. Tried three times gave up. 
---
A simple shout out for teammates is getting downvoted. This is why we can't have nice things
---
The game starts off easy, then they make it harder and then they add ways you can pay to make it easier again...
---
Which is actually part of the problem, because I think most players would assume it works as I describe it (I know I did for the longest time), and they logically get salty when they realize it doesn't.
---
Holy shit that's amazing lol you're way more productive with your free time at work than I am.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** Gauthijm! ^(hug)
---
The disconnects really put a damper on workshops and their viability.
---
Some things I do which help.
---
1. Try to stay on a friends server, that way hopefully you have someone you can rejoin on and get back to your server, being in a group will also rejoin you to the group after a disconnect or CTD(CrashToDesktop)
---
2. Power up the nearby power station, this will send 100(400?) Power to each workshop zone connected to that plant, you just have to connect a wire to the power plant panel in the workshop area and you save having to build generators. ( it takes 20-40 minutes to do the power up quest, first time is a pain to get the layout, much easier subsequent times.) Rewards kinda suck for the event and you gotta make the decision if the time to do the event is less than farming the materials to make a fusion reactor.
---
3. Streamline your builds, I usually stick with either the large generator or the windmill generators as I can usually make a couple of each and a couple extractors without burning into my materials much. I only cap the reasource nodes I want, the other are left alone.
---
It would be amazing if more people did the powering up events, but the rewards stink after you get your 3 plans so I totally understand why people dont bother, that and a likely crash occurs and you have to decide between starting again or playing a different game for the night.
---
I learned this when I found a two-shot laser pistol in my teens that said it did more than twice as much damage as my 10mm pistol but in reality did much less at point-blank range.
---
It's been that way since the first vendor map I found on week 1.
---
Keep in mind train station vendors can be for responder, raider, whitesprings, or watoga factions.  Cap pool is by faction with the odd ball being the wandering super mutant which is pooled with watoga.
---
I have zero illusions about the vaults. Judging by the vaults in the other games, I don't know why anyone would think it's going to be some giant new area... it's a vault. Even the biggest ones were what... 4 levels deep, with maybe 100 rooms total?
---
So I don't get the "it's gonna suck if vaults are small" mentality. A small area like a silo is exactly how big I'd expect a vault to be.
---
I agree that the game does not do much to help out a player new to the fallout franchise. But maybe they wanted it that way to encourage players to interact with each other. Since the premise is that we're all vault dwellers being released into the real world, it's not a stretch to think that we should not have our hands held and told about more complicated things like crafting.  I think I was around level 25 before I realized you could craft higher level weapons.
---
I have a two-shot gauss rifle that is sitting there waiting for them to make some of these fixes. Love the thing and it would be fantastic to use but somebody could be standing three feet away from me and in Vats I see both rounds go directly over their head into a split v formation.
---
To add to this: I got the BOS CA chest mod from Forbidden Knowledge
---
Well, developments in economic models for gaming goes hand-in-hand with "subscription fees" that started popping up with the advent of The Cloud. Everything had to be in The Cloud (tm), and you have to pay subscription fees in order to access the service. I believe the specific term for this type of model for gaming is ["GaaS" (games as a service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_as_a_service). The thing is that Bethesda doesn't really follow this model. Which implies that their revenue source (beside the original sale of the game) is something completely different. My guess is that they're experimenting with an online infrastructure that can handle something as heavy as the Creation Engine, and FO76 is the testing ground.
---
The central issue is the atom shop represents things that people might want, and some people are mad they can't afford every single thing in there. They complain about the real world price of Atoms, and costs of things in the store, but completely ignore the very high rate of in game accrual. It really is pretty wildly different than almost any other game with micro transactions. I have played dozens and never come across a game with this model. 
---
Then people seem to think maintaining the Atom shop is something that takes a team of 100 developers or something, and that by making a new power armor paint, they have somehow taken resources away from bug fixing. 
---
Which is idiocy. 
---
It think that is the high level summary. 
---
It's due to high level players being in the area or passed through it's not that any area is a high lvl area or "end game" it's due to other players.
---
Oh I don’t play it much anymore I’m a filthy casual. Right now I’m stuck on KH3 and ESO. When I play I play for fun. I don’t go looking for reasons to be mad about stuff. 
---
After about an hour my 3 industrial purifiers have 15 water. Not super helpful, but maybe you've got some underlying issue at work.
---
At some point the point is to make us make choice.  In order for the game to be fun there needs to be some challenge.  Players seem to want to do everything with no tradeoffs.   
---
I finally bit the bullet and decided that I'm getting by with a lever action and a mole miner gauntlet.   If I grab something, I need to have an immediate reason for it.
---
And the fact quests have you running across the map. And a level 10 sometimes has to deal with level 40 mole miners.
---
Black Excavator is in the game files. Be patient, save your atoms, it's coming.
---
Fair enough. It’s a commitment to live that life  
---
I make goals for myself.
---
My last goal was to help my wife fire off a nuke, and help her kill the SBQ.
---
Before that was to build a camp on the Seneca Mountains.
---
My current goal is to build a full suit of T51 power armour, and mod it out.
---
It keeps it fun and interesting.
---
Having a drawback might make sense if they weren't constantly screwing up the spec that people had built, but I think it's ludicrous to have to pay 1000 caps to fix something that the developers broke, with little to no warning. 
---
The perk system itself is kind of just a crutch for them. I mean can you imagine if perks were permanent, and then they just changed the effects like they did? But since you have the option they just assume it's fine for you to have to grind 10 or 20 more levels to change out a build.
---
Uh huh, and what's this "standard" you're talking about? 
---
The day after they added hunting rifle legendaries, I found an anti-armor level 50 at a vendor in Watoga.  Instantly the best weapon I have.
---
Personally I think the vault dlc will be about more then just the vaults - I'm kind of thinking that the vaults themselves won't be massive map upgrades but more a start to larger quests or hopefully new weapons armor costumes and buildings as well as expanded mechanics 
---
I mean if I get 200 hours of mechanics and a few hours of new raid zones I'm good with that I think we need to think less of it as a vault only area and more of a what comes out of those vaults? I mean I've been to the entrances of them all and they have some interesting looking things that could come out of them and into the local population who knows what kind of monsters are behind those doors waiting to enter the wastelands 
---
Usually this happens when there were high leveled players around. Spawn system works like that - if you were first to come to area at time of respawn, you'd get enemies of +/- your level.
---
Numbers:
---
||Torso|Limb|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Buttressed Marine|69/42/42|31/26/12|
---
|BoS Heavy Combat|96/96|35/45|
---
|Studded Heavy Leather|48/106|33/77|
---
|Polished Heavy Metal|117/20|54/12|
---
Alloyed metal has greater total resistances than polished on the torso, at 112/34.
---
They don't know, that's why. I was level 30 when I first went down there and had no clue. The game gives a server-wide quest to kill something, so you do it because it just looks like a quest. It's bad game design. Someone had to tell me about the difficulty scaling system before I knew it existed, and SBQ is the only fight it even matters so you only find out at end game, reading it online, or being told about that one specific thing that only applies to one enemy.
---
The DoT weapons are actually kinda OP.  Melee durability has a somewhat static value for bonus/penalty.  Mr Handy gets something like a 30point bonus and with electric mod has a lot of stuns.
---
Weekly flowers is known bugged. The Red Rocket photos are highly specific on location. Stand at the gas price sign and take your photo from there.
---
Well it it is soft core only because the risk is low so it is more open to other players. In ark literally 30+ hours of taming,  breeding and leveling dinos can be wiped out in an instant by wild dinos if you are not careful.
---
And if you are on pvp servers other tribes can attack your base. Wiped all your dinos and structures and loot all your weapons, armor and resources.  Even when you are not online.
---
It is softcore survival because it limits loss, limits difficulty and limits the grind far below other games in the same genre. 
---
I think they should pool a April fools joke where there is a random encounter where you hear / see npc's in the fair distance and never can reach them 
---
Didn't know that about ricochet, haven't really used it.  Good to know.  I did know about the cars and robots.  Being a stealthy sort I sometimes snipe off sentry bots for fusion cores.  Thankfully Whitesprings forgives, or has short term memory loss.
---
That's true. It takes a lot of perks/items to get my build. But with that build honestly I believe rifles are more OP than melee. And it's because of the range . I've done this with my friend before. We both stood in the same place and started to clear harpers ferry. He would get 1-2 kills to my 5-6. Likewise,  we both initiated pvp, and went and hid. About 90% of the time I would  kill him before he could even get close enough to think about swinging. 
---
? thats like, mild-flavored anger at worst. 
---
ever play mount&amp;blade?
---
If only there were in-game support for herrings.
---
Most of the enemies should be one or the other.  Supermutants fall into the same category.....
---
For about 5 minutes once wasn’t my cup of tea. 
---
Ugh yes! Like in FO4, you could remove almost anything that was in your build area. I miss that so much, and the scrap it used to give. 
---
Lots of people trade at the raidor vendor near there. 
---
I do ok.
---
Been running the same weapon/armor for a while. Scrap everything else. Scrapper Perk. The Laser rifles that SuperMutants drop are good for plastic, for bulking excess. Scrap everything else. Don't keep what you won't use. Scrap everything else.
---
If you pick up a shotgun that you think you might use later, scrap it. You'll find another.
---
Pick up all cans. Especially hanging can traps and lead weights.
---
Make basic leather armor to wear while you sneak around waiting for starred armor that better suits you. Don't repair leather armor if it's just basic armor. Scrap it. Build new.
---
Sneak and stealth. They can't hit you if they don't know where you are.
---
Play smart. Take cover when reloading. 
---
Ah hell. Just add me and load into a server with and I'll give you whatever scrap I have to tide you over?
---
racist. 
---
Lots of high level players.
---
It's not that it's impossible, it's just that it's such a waste of resources without the OP TSE that it's not even worth it anymore imho, you can just farm legendaries, exp and Flux at Whitespring if you need that. 
---
Only in ESO. Dunmer master race. Get rekt. 
---
I'm normally skeptical but I'll take your word for it.        But even if the camp loads immediately on the server it doesn't (seem to) load immediately on the client side.  
---
Wow thanks
---
Never got the point.  Outside of cuts scenes it's been fairly rare for them to be meaningful.  As for dialog, after the first pass it's rarely more then a nuisance in the way of getting to the action.
---
I have fun playing with game mechanics.  Then there was yesterday when a higher level person came into my camp, played on my instruments, looked around, and then called in an orbital strike destroying my place.  I didn't have fun with that, but I did kill him with my black powder rifle and a blow to the head with a super sledge.   
---
I'll be glad for the PvE only servers.  I had being dragged into other people's bullshit-fests without having a choice in the manner.  Having stuff get destroyed that took flux to build is a major pain in the ass.  I could care less about rebuilding 99% of my camp.  That one thing that took flux was f-ing bullshit.
---
Thanks.
---
This is how the game should be played
---
I'm pretty sure Colonel Gutsys use armor-penetrating rounds.  I'm not sure what the ideal counter is to that.
---
I find the biggest problem with them is that they are often deployed as liberally as their lesser cousins, so you'll be in Watoga and end up with a cluster of Colonel Gutsys on you.  It's a massive difficulty spike when this happens.
---
Fair point, I should have said "easy to get rich SUPER FAST."
---
I swear I saw a video of a guy 1v4ing with a a baseball bat lmaooo
---
Coffee tins are my go to for aluminum. You get 2 for each tin and they seem to be everywhere. 
---
Not good per se, bud badly needed? Was constantly farming lead for my shotgun / .44 and was running out of adhesive / switching to melee when I did my first treasure map. Got a 78 damage rifle (shooting .308?) which I had 1500 ammo. So. Not terribly amazing but definitely welcomed. Level 29 btw. 
---
Combine that with a marsupial mutation and you give a whole new meaning and whole new geometry to the runs.
---
the great majority of players do not play thousands of hours, let alone tens of thousands. I know these people exist, but they are not the majority, and they are not the only "true fans." These figures are also over these games *entire lifetimes.* Fallout 3 and NV both came out about 10 years ago. Fallout 4 came out almost 5 years ago. not to mention all three titles got at least 3 dlc's worth of content added over these lifetimes (5 for fallout 3). 76 barely came out 2.5 months ago. I guarantee that the people that are pushing thousands of hours did not do so in the first months of gameplay. for reference, 2000 hours of playtime over six months is 11 hours per day, every day. this is not normal, and this is not the average gamer. if we round up our calculations and say people are getting to 500 hours in 3 months (still conservative by your measure), then those people would have completed 2000 hours in one year @ almost 5 and a half hours per day, every day. again, not the average gamer, or even the average fallout player.
---
on top of that, 76 was announced from the beginning with Bethesda's intention to follow the games-as-a-service model. this means that it will be catered to and updated regularly with content. the first full DLC for the two fallout games that Bethesda made (3, 4) came out 3 months after release. we are just now creeping up on that mark. the game hasn't even been able to come into fruition and people are writing it off. this was already happening a month ago. I understand frustration with bugs, but don't tell me that the game sucks and is unplayable when you have voluntarily dedicated a significant chunk of your time over the last two months to play.
---
I get what you're saying, even though you're being an elitist gatekeeper about it. if all the game had to offer over the span of it's entire life was 400 hours, it would be disappointing; though still a great value, and hardly a "bad game." objectively, $60 (and plenty of people are getting it for way less) for 400-700 hours of entertainment is amazing.
---
until we see what the real content that is coming is, it is unfair to completely write this game off based on this 450 hour premise. it's future, however, does hinge on upcoming content. I don't see this game putting out 10k+hours for the most hardcore players, but this is not the end at all, and many have already gotten their money's worth, regardless of if they are sour because they have nothing to do now.
---
Lv 72 with around 100 hours in. I spend a lot of time just fucking around. I read terminals and listen to holotapes. The story and experiences of Appalachia is fascinating. funny stories and heart wrenching stories. I still have unexplored areas of the map I check out occasionally. Look for plans. I play around with building camps a lot. If you basically realize you don't actually NEED 10 turrets, you have a ton of building options. 
---
But largely, there is a TON of story content in this game. It just isn't delivered spoon feed in an NPC cutscene. you have to work for it. There are lots of unmarked spots in the game with little stories or easter eggs or whatnot. Just the other day I stumbled across a suitcase a little outside vault 76 that has a note in it that mentions delivering armor to the agriculture research center. Totally missed that on the first play through. it would of been nice because if you follow the miscellaneous quest it give you, you'd have a leather chest piece pretty early in the game! 
---
People keep saying the game is boring and empty. I just can't understand it. Those people are just not trying at all. 
---
I got my marine mask and wet suit from farming Mirelurk Queens. I thought it was by chance but I told my buddy and helped him and sure enough they dropped it after some time. 
---
This was my exact experience as well.   I was done last week and will not be back.  If I get the need to play a fallout game I will just play 3,4, or new vegas.
---
Remember there are hidden stats in those mods.  Some use more AP than others.   Some add acc when sighted.     Like short barrels don't fire as far but use less AP for VATS.  Long barrels add more sighted acc. 
---
Yea, which is why I went VATS and Melee too. The number one thing I wanted was diversity, any weapon is boring to me if it's the only single weapon you can use.
---
Sneak with a 10mm, VATS with a western or melee. Most diverse way to play I've found so far.
---
The good news is that only about half the plans available in the game are at the vendors. The other half are still reserved for event rewards and world spawns. So, there is still plenty to do in this game hunting plans through RNG.
---
That's not griefing
---
They're just stacking perception bobbleheads, that's all. I've never been missed by a gutsy shot.
---
Your paper company analogy is so not applicable to this situation, I won't even try to pick it apart. I don't know what the hell you're talking about with "my math". I just said if you think that 450 hours of literally anything is a waste of money, why the hell didn't you stop at, I dunno, 5 hours? 25 hours? 100 hours? My argument is you're an entitled idiot if you play something for 450 hours they say you didn't get your money's worth.
---
Also the game has been out for about 10 weeks. 450 hours is over 11 full time work weeks. So that means anyone logging that much time has been playing Fallout 76 more than I've been going to work. If you can do that, then come on here and say "this game has no content, I'm bored, etc.", you also need to reevaluate your definition of "absurd". If you play more video games than most people need to work to exist on the planet, I don't really care what you think the value of $60 is.
---
I did the math, and a full spec into (non-legendary) explosives / grenades is 13 perk points. Which means 6-7 levels to updates your SPECIAL points, and potentially 13 more levels to get the right perk cards. So worst case, it can still be like 20 more levels to rebuild a character, just from the demo expert nerf.
---
That is the plan with all of the vaults as they already been explored via glitching through the doors. Which revealed that they are all failed vaults with a terminal to register/start your raid of them.  
---
A *lot* of quests congregate at Top of the World, which means players of all levels will end up there.  Because the enemy spawns skew toward the highest-level player, it can become an extremely dangerous location for low-levels.
---
Bailed after a month, too many problems, not enough fixes
---
Containers in general are odd now.  Some seem to take a couple days, then I can search a few again after a server hop.
---
In my defense I did pull the number out of my ass. :D
---
Bethesda is just shooting themselves in the foot everytime they change the game.
---
In my opinion the game is most lacking in quests and story, which they have added none of since release, and they will likely add little towards the story. They are more worried about adding items to the atom shop than making the game interesting and enjoyable to play.
---
I still like the game
---
Maybe bethesda needs to start banning Gutsys for exploiting
---
I like it alot. Wished it painted the accessories too
---
Containers that always had caps (like the stump at flatwoods) seem to take a day plus now as well.
---
I'll buy that changing is a char is probably necessary over the long term, but that change should be \*your own choice\*. It's unfair to players to let them pick a path, and then later make that path not viable without giving them any options to recover the time they've put into the game.
---
I wear no armor and melee one shot them all day long.  Solo nuke run, easy.  Armor isn't always the answer. 
---
Oh nice! I feel bad now for thinking that person may have something he shouldn't. I hate that I always feel like I have to be so careful. 
---
So it won’t work on the Voice of Set?  Only have it on one of my legendary .44s currently.  
---
Yep, it's just hoarding.  Let go people!  Grab what you need now and leave the rest for the next guy!
---
Fallout 76 is one of, if not the least tedious/hard survival game out there. I'm LVL 185 and I stopped playing a while ago. Only two times I considered the game truly "tedious": When farming for springs and ballistic fiber. That was before I found out about the correct spots where to farm and get them. A simple google will solve your issues. It seems like you don't usually play survival games and I understand in that case. When I was level 30 I didn't even need to repair my weapons (or armor) (My friend played WITHOUT armor)  Just keep crafting leather armor when one piece breaks and use hunting rifles and melee weapons you find on enemies and scrap them. Early on you shouldn't really care about anything. Just pick up, scrap and loot anything. When you get to LVL 50 is when you can start to somewhat plan your inventory. 
---
Never insinuated any of those things. Just poked fun of your post. ;)
---
Fallout has always been a hybrid. Everything in 76 was in FO4 with the exception of multiplayer, and the multiplayer is more or less fine in the sense that it's easy to ignore PVP and co-op isn't necessary/has no particular catastrophic fails.
---
I disagree with your assessment of patches and Bethesda not caring. They've actually released a bunch of updates that specifically addressed prominent player feedback. And every update brings a lot of tweaks and generally only a few of them get negative pushback-- it's just that some people obsess over those negatives, or are only affected by the negatives, and thus that's all they can think about.
---
It's cool if you defended the game in the past. There's no need to though. It is what it is, the only important part is enjoying it while you can and speaking up when you have something useful to say. Everything else is whatever.
---
A fat kid. A fat kid always takes the cake. 
---
The truck for the disappearing bag is drop 1 bullet or 1 junk and watch the bag appear then drop whatever and it will fill the bag without issue
---
&gt;Ammo is quiet rar, have to be looted or crafted and weights noticeable.
---
*/laughs in &gt;10,000 rounds of 5mm in their inventory, then cries in minigun not OP*
---
&gt;Guns have CND and even break quiet fast
---
*/laughs in three spare miniguns and Gunsmith V, then cries in minigun still not OP*
---
&gt;The carry capacity is limited
---
*/laughs in Bear Arms III, then cries bitter tears because minigun never OP*
---
I don't mind the bullet sponges at all, I just wish my minigun were finally OP.
---
Yes I suggested 24+ because I never encounter anyone with 24 currently, so I was confused by your 6-10. Maybe you're just more lucky than me!
---
Yeah Idk though It looks great with Iron sights and the white grip and even with the straight black grip sights kinda ruin the effect.
---
This game has all the bad parts of an mmo but none of the good parts. Sad. 
---
I drop a few hundred in overseers crates for the new folks.  They may actually have need for the low end ballistic at least.
---
Yeah, they got the sound effect wrong for that barrett 50 cal they carry around. Sounds like one of those cracker barrel toy cork guns. 
---
Assuming this game we're going to be abandoned by the player base, the addition of NPCs would not change that.  I like this game a lot but I feel myself starting to get bored. So once I've explored every nook and cranny the only thing left will be the hunt for the greatest loot. That'll probably get boring pretty fast.
---
Bethesda rep here said it was two separate teams, between game dev and ATOM shop.  
---
Yeah, you are right. This is supposed to be the best damn sandbox shooter ever made. The problem is Bethesda Austin 1) can't tame this engine 2) are under orders to make a sterile looter shooter to compete with Destiny, Division and Anthem. 
---
Gary.
---
No idea never did that quest line just wish it worked for single actions and the oh so lovely Western
---
It’s pretty irrelevant since you’re on Xbox like I am and we already have the looking for group set up for games.
---
a) You can only swap out cards if you have them, and tons of cards you can't even get until higher levels. I'm trying to setup a new build now and I'm looking mostly at cards I don't have.  
---
b) If you are under level 50 and got hit by this, you are doubly screwed since you can't change any SPECIAL points already invested.
---
Same ;_;
---
I lost 800 lbs of Junk yesterday server hopping into a nuke zone and not wearing power armor. Killed me and then booted me from server. Good news... it is JUNK. FO4 never did that because it is offline, solo game...it can save whenever it wants and will autosave. Online MMO cannot autosave every 30 seconds or you would crash servers and people complain more about lost JUNK. 
---
As far as hours of work? ... eh, I completed those trials in about 20 to 30 minutes. Moral is "don't explode mr. Gutsy if you have to run from the fight and lose quest progress. :)
---
I agree with the vault tec stuff, things like vault-tec paints for gear really don't make sense lorewise and as you mentioned, they really emphasize it too much. For one, a player character could be a million other things instead of a vault dweller.
---
Maybe they want to provide players with familiar things when in a new area/game, or if it really is some corporate franchise/recognition push. Whatever the case they do seem to rely on those certain things a bit too much, when there should be a wealth of new things to create/discover.
---
Yeah. If they removed the card deck mini game and replaced it with a normal skill/perk/ability score system, the game would already be more sensible. So much would be simpler to deal with if you didn’t have to fuck around with cards. 
---
So you can complain on something else lol nah
---
Yes the tedious grind perfectly explains it. And it's not necessarily that grinding is bad, it's just that it's bad in this game. 
---
Think for instance, Diablo 3, a game who's end-game is nothing but grinding. What's the diff? Well D3 is constantly rewarding. You grind and get powerful, you grind more and get more powerful and so on and so forth. You are rewarded with more gold than a character ever needs, but damn it if it doesn't feel good when you open a vault and get 24 million more?
---
You grind till you get that *TSE equivalent* weapon that will perfect your build. Are you done now? No, because it's not ancient! Now you got an ancient one you stop? Nah, cause I gotta get that primal shit. Also here's a couple puzzle rings, let's raid the vault 30 more times.
---
Also, let's grind rifts to level gems! Gotta hit max level on everything. Top the leaderboards!
---
We already make our own holotape like additions on the fallout feed. It’s a great format. 
---
At level 25 I killed 2 level 80 scorchbeasts yesterday. 2 MIRV grenades once they landed killed them. Dense on chest and fireproof perk make the sonic blast damage next to 0. 
---
Good luck getting them to land. 
---
I like the idea of this but I think we'd learn pretty fast to keep our welcome mats on solid ground.
---
Yeah yeah, I got them done in about 30 minutes too, but not everyone is so coordinated with their Xbox controllers :-S
---
RemindMe! 2 days

Normally I'm pretty good about that. The other day I needed some cork to make a piece of armor Ultra-light. I said f**k it and I went through all of the Whitespring's gold-club buildings, and the maintenance building in the parking lot, and I picked up every single item that can be picked up or looted. I ended up with about 1,000 pounds of carry weight before I started scrapping things.
---
I had mats for days and was able to repair all my weapons, all 5 pieces of armor I had on me, installed my 2nd calibrated shock for my Excavator PA, and modified many stored pieces of armor to be Ultra-light. I then bulked up a bunch of junk and went on a selling spree,
---
Being a high level most of the time people are used to zero competition and winning every battle...when some comes and crushes that by killing in one or two hits it sucks. At least I think that’s why people get mad because that what gets me mad just destroys that self confidence. 
---
I’ve had people contest workshops before with TSE and it sucked because it was a one hit kill on me but it do be like that sometimes.  
---
Sadly, that's just how it is for now.  Much like Fallout 4, the game ends on a whimper of boredom rather than a bang.
---
I don't see that changing anytime soon.  I think there's almost unanimous consensus that the game needs more endgame content, but Bethesda apparently decided that PvP survival was a much higher priority.  That, and the one PvE "raid" they do have with the Scorchbeast Queen now offers virtually no incentive for participating.
---
I'll find out sometime soon!

---
This happened to me last night. I just went and played fallout 4. At least my heavy weapons feel good over there.
---
I like the models like gutsy etc. gotta catch em all-
---
It seems to me that there is something similar, of an npc that explodes with a homemade bomb. I think it's called Ford 
---
K bye
---
Yeah the witches outfit is a difficult to obtain outfit, you get it from a random vent spawn point. Nothing from the dev room. 
---
Goodbye
---
If you mean the BOS officer suit, that can be upgraded to give bonus' to SPECIALS and some resistance, I got it as a spawn plan in the trainyard west of the Watoga Station. We were just exploring, clearing out things, and searching, and there it was. I can't remember exactly where. I do believe it was in a car. 
---
Most won't fight I'd you are not wearing PA hard to tell who's got the OP armor.
---
Agreed. Mayhaps trying the quest without the Anger Management Problem teammate who rage shoots the guard staff would be more of an appropriate setting.
---
Imagine having him be the one to say, "Enclave here. Why isnt your video feed working?"
---
Borderlands allows respeccing at will for a percentage of your cash on hand. I changed by builds all.the time looking for that perfect build, ya know. 
---
Worst discussion 2019.
---
I mean your alternative is we have no ability to swap perks and everything is boring static. Or they remove all of the QOL perks and it becomes nothing more than a spam of combat improvements that have no real dynamic qualities and the whole leveling process becomes a predictable 'choose your appropriate weapon boost' every single level.
---
I don't understand people who complain about this. It's common in RPGs, and I personally never have to swap any perks except the one that reduces hunger/thirst when in camp. If you're swapping perk cards 'every 2 minutes' then you are a horrible min/maxer and causing yourself grief for no particular reason, because the game isn't that hard and it really doesn't need optimal builds like rushing world firsts in an MMO. 
---
2 cents anyway.
---
I think I'd only be pissed if I were about to leave anyway. I'd rather invite you to the team, turn the workshop over to you and head on out. 
---
The first few months of workshop events were peaceful enough but I think that's over now.
---
Atom shop nonsense eventually I’d imagine-
---
171 here. I’m in the same boat. Haven’t logged in for more than an hour in two weeks. Nothing to do. 
---
I've plenty of times mistaken the PvP alert as a defend workshop alert, and then get ganked by some turd in sentinel armor. If the PvP alert was better I don't think so many would be surprised by it.
---
Next update is PVP if you can hold out until then maybe we will get more info on PVE content in the works. I’m in same boat as you. Loot from most everything sucks , grinding to upkeep my gear and weapons is tedious. I dropped the ball and just uninstalled to make room for my next game i preordered but I’ll keep the Fo76 Disc since they will sooner or later have a managble endgame path for us. Good luck friend!
---
The obnoxious thing is, I have armor pen rounds too. So like, wai?
---
Was playing today and the Serendipity animation popped up. I own the perk but I’ve never equipped it and I wasn’t even in combat.
---
That’s a fair system.
---
Well, go play another game for a while and come back when there are significant changes to the game (new content, real balance update)
---
I agree with the need for higher difficulty bosses, the only major one id the SBQ, all others are easy to fight.
---
So Whitesprings?
---
Nope I like it. Compared to what I usually play (Overwatch), I come to FO76 to relax.
---
In fact, if I relax even a little more I might involuntarily soil my self. 
---
The obnoxious thing is that I’m using armor pen too, so it’s like... wai.
---
Yeah but what if you get fixed up with someone who throws grenades at ghouls or is a Nazi sympathizer
---
Yes I’ve had that happen many times 
---
In same boat as you, left a few weeks ago. Will return if they fix the graphics and bring the gameplay to what it was during beta in terms of balance and mechanics (can't believe I'm even saying that about a game).
---
Maybe up the limited time to like 2-3 days. But honestly I like that they are limited. That way not everyone will have everything everyone else does.
---
Plus, I'm sure in time they will bring back old items again. Probably for a limited time as well. 
---
A good part of my early build was around weight reduction perks.  The TSE never really bothered me until I got to about level 50 and saw the nerfs take effect.  I have fully perked to compensate w/ammosmith and demo expert (among other things) as I really like rifles and shotguns and like shooting stuff.  No offense to Super Sledge or War Drum mods but it’s not as much fun as blasting fools and critters.  I loved my legendary 50 cal w/explosive until they killed it with the patch.  
---
That's a FO4 feature not a FO76.
---
Yeah
---
I get fuckin trashed by scorched beasts. I need the resistance to them. They're impossible to hide from. Melee attackers are more of a pest than anything else. 
---
Welcome to the club. 
---
I couldnt be any less interested in the newest "content":  survival mode (which isnt anything new). I think I killed one player in pvp in 300+ hours of my time in the wasteland.
---
And mods. You can’t craft a new sniper and then swap your mods. Nope. Remove a mod? It gets scrapped. 
---
Demo Expert might have been different than other weapon perks, but explosives were already pretty useless without perks like Demo Expert and Grenadier. And the weight hit is a deal breaker without Ordnance Express, if say, you want to carry missiles or mini-nukes or even 40mm.  
---
Basically they just took a perk that actually balanced some serious drawbacks to that weapon type, and knocked it down enough that it's not really that useful anymore.
---
I found the plan during launch. Haven’t seen them since.
---
I don't want to min/max.
---
I want to play Fallout. I want to explore. I want to pick locks. 
---
Cool you stand at Whitesprings hacking and slashing for 8 hours a day.....I don't want to play that game.
---
Fallout shouldn't have attempted to turn this franchise into Rust. Just make a new fucking game.....call it Corrosion.
---
On average have a stock of 300+ of the stuff never seen an issue with it other then I was first able to craft marine armor.
---
It's the only repair item I'm not in triple digits on. 
---
Just don't know where to get it reliably.
---
That's a nice cane. I want it. 
---
The game just feels like a grind fest. I’ve been stuck between level14-17 for ages. And everything now feels like a chore. I’ve tried seeking out ways to level up and it’s just a grind. And I don’t care enough about the story mode to pursue any actual action there. But I’ll kill a creature similar or higher in level to me and it results in not a whole lot of anything. 
---
Also side note: does anything on the other side of the savage divide level match? Every time I stumble near the Whitesprings Resort I get destroyed by level 60+ ghouls. Even if no one is near that area. I did manage to kill one once but I got shit for experience points on it. 
---
Ammo can be a sneaky contributor of weight, especially since the game loves to load you down with Missiles and Mini-Nukes from Events.  Check there, for starters.
---
Check ammo for missles or mini nukes. Them fuckers are heavy.
---
I also think Blizzard never dared to release such a buggy mess. 
---
I would if the only other game I'm interested in right now wasnt ESO 😂
---
Nah you just suck
---
It's Fred with an open mic, making popcorn again.
---
I've seen all the vaults and as far as I know (educated guess), they will be event-style content. I truly doubt they will be interconnected with an external quest-line. 
---
I wish they'd let you use a combo of repair mats and caps for anything you don't have enough of. 
---
It’s enough you’re just dirty 
---
perhaps. But then you would still have bad legendary drops and the fusion core removal 
---
I see no reason why it shouldn't.  Weapon damage....maybe not.  But I like the way new vegas handled it....Your weapon becomes unreliable (accuracy penalties and chance of jamming) as it gets closer and closer to outright breaking.
---
For armor, it just makes sense that worn armor provides less protection.  There are holes in it, gaps, weak points.  That translates, in game terms, to "less protection"
---
I'm probably going to sound like a dick for asking, but what's the point of having an expensive Decontamination Arch in the first place?  It's not like RadAway is that hard to come by.
---
Yep.  Since the last patch
---
If the pvp community was more active it may bring some of the fun back, but every time you try to engage in pvp people wants to cry... So everyone runs passive and strays from other players. 
---
You know this is exactly what they are going to be. Just like 30 minute romps in Fallout 4. 
---
I'm thinking they will be like "Strikes" in destiny. 
---
It's not harder you just feel far to weak
---
I do not see an option for pole hook or spear. I know pole hook has a mod to make it barbed, never saw a modded spear (both weapons do not drop often though)
---
Most players would rather PvP didn't exist. It's annoying enough trying to get value out of a workshop between the disconnects, without other players taking it just so that they can pick a fight.
---
I expect the first rule of Survival is going to be "set up your exploit build on PvE servers", anyway.
---
It will only trigger like all the other events now. It used to just start when you went into the high school, but I guess it was changed with last patch.
---
Yea, that could keep legendary enemies tanky without entirely killing the idea.
---
Misc category for pre and gunpowder
---
Leave em be. They're one of the few things in game that get my adrenaline going. Mirelurk queens spitting acid. Lv52 gutsies.
---
I like this idea alot. Especially if the cooler/fridge options can be powered and preserve food longer. But I'm not sure if it would improve performance of the server or if it would decrease performance. Not my kinda work. Lol. But I would like anything that gives me more storage.
---
I was going to say, if you really wanna " get em" just store your arch every time you leave your base.
---
I did solo as well, but on bravo, I used the code that someone posted on here.
---
I'm probably going to do a solo run again this week. 
---
I spent 20min waiting outside Vault 76 for a lvl 1 I spotted. I grabbed some purified water and crafted an awesome(ish) lvl 1 revolver with ALL the goodies.
---
He logged off before getting out. The little shit. 
---
Make sure you didn't accidentally remove a perk that helps with weight.
---
Do they offer microtransactions that make it a little less tedious? Because that may be a motive as well
---
Do you have weight reduction perks? If so, take a look at what youve stashed
---
  If you have 90% reduction on big guns, for example, that wont apply when it is in your stash.
---
Gutsies use some kind of armor penetrating round, which *hurts* even when you're in power armor. Did the Mayor For A Day quest today and during the final part on the roof it spawned something like a dozen Gutsies at once. I panic-stimpaked through my entire supply during that fight. I swear I heard them laughing about my power armor.
---
The key to making encounters with a Gutsy easy is to *always aim for their arms.* Their stupid little arms are their weak spot, so unload on those and you'l be fine. If your aim is real good, you can even cripple their "gun" arm and force them to switch to a laser.
---
But yeah, Gutsies suck. I love them.
---
Are all of your resources in your stash? I know that at least used to be the problem.
---
I too run around with Pacifist Mode on, until I turned it off briefly yesterday.   A douchebag came into my camp, played on my instruments, looked around, and dropped an artillery strike onto my camp destroying a very expensive to fix decontamination arch.  He caused a shit ton of other damage that I don't give a flying crap about because I can get all of those resources in about 20 minutes without trying hard.   The flux on the other hand is a major pain in the ass to craft.
---
I had no choice in having my camp destroyed, Bethesda.  Your "wanted" is meaningless when he had to pay 20 caps to do 2000+ caps worth of damage to me.   It should scale.  If someone throws a grenade at a mob and accidentally takes out a turret, fine, let the person be wanted for a low amount.  If someone throws an orbital or artillery strike and levels your entire f-ing camp, then that person should lose the same value when they die...when someone takes them out.   If they don't have the same resources, then their legendary weapons and legendary armor should be scrapped and converted into what ever it takes to repair the damage they did.  If you want wasteland justice, then letting griefers get away with a 20 cap bounty is garbage.  
---
I literally would have gotten over the whole "my camp got destroyed" very quickly if it hadn't been for the repair costs on something that uses flux!    
---
Bethesda:  The other thing to consider - Don't charge someone flux to repair their camp.  What the hell?
---
I destroyed someone’s camp last night and every object I destroyed kept adding 10 caps until I had a 300 cap bounty 
---
Where was your camp?  The other side of Whitesprings you say?
---
I honestly don't even know what you're talking about now. xD
---
I'm telling you that you don't HAVE TO min/max. That was my point, I'm not recommending it. I'm telling you that if you are swapping perks that often then you are choosing to min/max, there's no other explanation. So why don't you just stop doing that? If you picked a perk that's situational you can just leave it as-is. Swapping that perk out just because it's not currently useful is not necessary. 
---
I also don't know what you mean when you talk about standing at Whitesprings hacking and slashing. I don't grind mobs, dude. I never have. I have explored one (1) blast zone in over 200 hours of playing. 
---
This game is not Rust. It didn't try to be Rust. I don't know why people even bring up the name Rust when they talk about 76. This game is a non-competitive, casual, expansive world roamer with lite optional endgame grind. That's basically all this game is. The survival aspects aren't demanding at all, the PVP is not brutal at all. Is not Rust or even in the ballpark.
---
I'm on PC if you want to buy it
---
no need to take my word for it - hop on discord with a friend and have them share their screen as they log in ...
---
It's because they have been nerfed my two shot fat man only does 1 more point of damage.
---
Y E S
---
I'd imagine without White Knight, the required amount is pretty exorbitant these days (yeah, way to go on that "non-mandatory" logic, Bethesda), and players just don't understand where to get it in such high supply.
---
There are a lot of things in this game that are easy-when-you-know-how.  Put yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't, who may not even know about White Knight, who doesn't really understand which loot items yield Ballistic Fiber.
---
Dam dude this is awesome wish there where more people like you that can do awesome things like this 
---
That's not what this was about. 
---
*You’re
---
Fort Defiance always has a lot
---
Yeah the decontamination shower is the worst part for sure. 
---
Yeah, I thought about that earlier today:  The decontamination arch is going into storage. 
---
Conduits are simple. The most important thing to remember about any conduit is that walls can be placed through them. So if you want a conduit to run through a wall, store the wall, place the conduit stuff down, replace the wall, and you're good. My base was using conduits but I expanded and had to switch to wire since they use less budget.
---
100% agree. I played my time in destiny but a whole lot of WoW and Neverwinter. The rewards in FO76 are extremely disappointing. 
---
The biggest threat for me was the reactor room with all the radiation, I play a non power armor stealth sniper and I almost died before I was able to get my hazmat suit on.
---
Choosing not to run 3 lock pick cards 24/7 is min/maxing?
---
I've always just called that common sense.
---
Please tell me this actually works... 
---
totally agree. Fluorescent flux seems to drop like the ultracite explosive vent from the queen event for me too. I was wondering why my stash was getting so crammed and it turned out I had 68 of those. I had to sell some off this morning.  One of the aid perks drops high radiation fluids and hardened mass down to .3 for me so I just carry those but the flux is a killer on the stash box.
---
Mmm, maybe just add a bit on the responders early quests, where they teach you cooking, building, and the like.
---
Have a holotape if someone complaining about storage space running out and someone else saying to scrap and bulk wrap the junk. Something like that maybe?
---
I’m embarrassed for how long it took me to realize how much space scrapping and wrapping saves
---
It's a fair question.   My camp is near a popular nuke zone.  So being able to run through a decon arch is pretty cool, I think.   If others don't agree, that's no problem.
---
Yeah not enough. There is never going to be a player economy that isn't reliant on encumbered mule characters as long as we can't even store a reasonable number of items in our stash.
---
Hoarder problem 
---
I dont play anymore but when I did I just didnt wear armor at all and just fucked around shooting animals and ferals 
---
The issue with it is that they shipped the game with hardly any end-game content. It just feels so lazy, there are so many things they could have implemented (bosses, more missions like the nuke silos). This, along with the state of the game on release, with all the bugs (some of which remain) makes it seem like such a lazy job from them.
---
I was wrong with the nomenclature. There's what I think is a bus station, or depot of some sort, with 2 protectrons usually walking around it. It's in the SW part of the town.
---
So is it on a timer or something need to be done to start it?
---
Nope.. tried tonight. 
---
I'm not a programmer or anything, but I work in tech and love a good database... I think I'm right about the "why's" of how Stash performance works. I've lagged servers just by rapidly bulking, as I'm sure many of us have. The database needs to be toned down!
---
You destroyed it piece by piece, so escalated bounty.  This guy destroyed it all at once with an artillery strike.  20 caps.
---
Alas, Xbox. 
---
I almost greefed my first time on a player who was at a vendor bot for a really really long time. Took a deep breath then hopped servers. The nerve of that player
---
Right now I've got an extractor, 6 water purifiers, and a tiny garden that are all fully encircled by foundation pieces, but that's admittedly a bit out of control.   
---
I've done others though that are just a 1x2 garden spot and another 1x2 for the extractor, and that's enough to farm starch 10 mats at a time. I do a lot of buildings on stilts over the foundation ring.
---
Yea, that was pretty much it. When I came across the stash box I dumped everything in, I thought it was an overseers cache so I started taking stuff out. Turns out I took 15 fusion cores, a few missiles and some grenades out.
---
I've never found a chainsaw! That's awesome! What are you wearing?
---
More like a timer
---
Well, if that "popular nuke zone" is Whitesprings, you're bound to garner some hostility.
---
Otherwise, I could understand why a free rad reduction would be useful.
---
That panic though, when you hear that armor-piercing railgun out of nowhere and a third of your health is gone. And then another third. Oh he brought some friends (spamming 'H' key as I look for cover, too encumbered to run away).
---
They're basically mini-bosses but with no significant reward. One of the few seriously dangerous enemies in the endgame.
---
My wish is that:
---
1. Those gutsies dropped legendary rewards.
---
2. More legendary enemies were tough and scary like that.
---
Thats sick
---
600 should be plenty, but it depends on what you're trying to do.  You can't stash weapons or endless supplies of chems/stimpacks.  It just wont work. (Im constantly bumping into my 600 and dumping...usually ammo, sometimes other things).  Dont try to hoard fusion cores either.  I have 11 100% cores, and about another 9 or 10 in the 90's.  That's over 50 stash weight right there.  Just in fusion cores.  Add in 50 stimpacks and that's 1/6th of my stash with 2 hoarded items. (well...stacks of them, but you get the idea)  
---
You just have to go back over what you're saving so much of and then get rid of some of it.
---
I messaged you.  Were you still interested in this?
---
I really wish you to find someone who will sell them to you. 
---
I think i m close to 40 hours server hopping the enclave and i found 1. What i want to say is people farming them will probably want to keep it for themselves or sell it at a very high price.
---
So if you don’t find any seller you ve got 2 options : farm the enclave and lose your sanity (like me) or wait for Bethseda to fix this and put the mods always available at the Enclave.
---
My hope is that the vaults will open and let out a whole throng of horrors into Appalachia - changing and populating the world around them into new biomes, filled with nasty new creatures to kill, new recipes, new mods, new armor, new weapons, and a new power armor model - *as well as* a whole vault complex to explore, with some living humans to interact with. I'd be super happy with that. 
---
HOWEVER - my bet is on them just opening a small new dungeon area, completed in 45 minutes, as OP stated. With maybe a new or recycled-but-previously-not-in-this-game enemy or two, and a new gun. Also, holotapes. A ton of holotapes.
---
This game is so Broke.  I would ask for a refund but I'm afraid they'll just post all my info online for everyone to steal.
---
Maybe people would listen to you if you could provide undeniable facts that it was Austin alone that handled the development of F76 as opposed to what most other interview stated being a joint effort project across multiple dev studios(including maryland). And lets be real here for a second regardless of which Bethesda studio it is be it maryland or the Austin one they all release bug ridden games(hello Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3,NV,4. So your whole "but it wasn't Maryland who did this" means little to nothing cause even Maryland can't code a game properly. F76 would've been just as buggy if it was entirely done by the Maryland studio alone. 
---
I didn't say that: So, are you saying you're the guy that decided to level the exterior of my camp?  
---
Can’t say I don’t feel the same either.  I’ve built my ideal base, gathered a respectable set of gear, mutated to my liking (by chance, not serum), and killed the ScorchBeast Queen with a pole hook.  Aside from prying the doors off of Vault 63, 69, and 94...I’m kinda done.
---
I don’t mind not getting a refund, it was fun for a while but not anymore 
---
Yea, if you're causing yourself pain and doing something tedious for no better reason than to constantly optimize your character, that's exactly what it is. xD
---
I mean if you were ONLY swapping lock pick cards then you wouldn't be, and frankly that's not very painful (I only find t3 chests maybe once every hour or two). But then, clearly you're not ONLY swapping those if you're doing it 'every 2 minutes', so I dunno what to tell you. It sounds like conflicting reports now. xD
---
Either stop swapping your perks and just embrace that your character is diverse and not always optimized, or keep swapping your perks and accept that you're unnecessarily optimizing.. at least that's how I see it!
---
Lol. I've already gone insane!
---
Turrets take up a lot of space from your budget. If you want to build more you may need to scrap some.
---

---
/u/lonevaultwanderer could the devs give us some sort of explanation about the loot tables? Sometimes 3* legendaries drop literally nothing. Or in my case, a clipboard and most recently a single rad x. 
---
I'll party with you in my very common ritual bindings. 
---
What resources are need for shocks, also I'll buy a t51 arm from u
---
It's actually kind of a bummer they give us a nice set of defensive walls to build and then restrict the CAMP budget so much you basically can never really use them.
---
Honestly, the last update really hurt my feelings...it’s depressing to see what my rifle damage has fallen to, I still enjoy the game but I’m a little worried my heart won’t be able to take the imminent nerf on my melee. I’m all for a challenge and I still get around just fine, even in a nuke zone but, the struggle was real up to level 50-60, I should be able to walk around like the god I was at this point. Darn you, Bethesda. Just Darn you. I’ll be getting drunk in my C.A.M.P. if anybody needs me. 
---
Well it does fit most survival games.  I mean you generally are suppose to avoid enemy encounters in most survival games . 
---
 The main issue is there aren't a lot of ways to level up or find gear in fo76 without killing things . So there is a conflict in genres. 
---
They need to make enemies easier to kill , or add more ways to level / gear up that doesn't require killing 
---
Shoot up a flare and hide.
---
When asshole comes to investigate murk them.
---
Have you tried marking specific elements?  Honestly Lead, loose springs, and occasionally gears, are the only things I have trouble keeping up with.  Then my buddy told me you can mark specific craft types and then it will show you a magnifying glass next to items that have that crafting type so you know to pick it up.  I don't have problems with most any of that stuff any more, I'm almost level 50, I'm always in Power Armor, and I don't have any problem with fusion cores because once every couple weeks I'll spend the first 30 minutes of my time setting up a power plant to farm the damn things.  I did that 3 days in a row and went on questing I have like 40 full fusion cores.  Not to mention some of the work bench locations let you farm Lead, and Junk like Springs and Gears and Screws.  You just have to set up the damn farm, build some defenses, go on your marry way, the game tells you when its being contested by another player, and in my experience, I haven't been contested much, and most people don't take advantage of these workstations, if a super high level contest me, cool I can just server hop and do it again, or I have already farmed so many I won't need to for weeks.
---
Yeah, Bethesda say a lot of thing's...5 patches and the game is ina  worse state than launch say's a lot more though.
---
I have the industrial. Not sure if bug or just design flaw. But it does make 60/hour, it just only holds 5 at a time. 
---
Your a smart enough guy, you can work that out.
---
Been lucky myself and no one has tried to take my workshops while I have them. But I am fully aware of the possibility and think that's how it should be. Workshops are not safe spaces and the threat of being killed is what makes taking them worth while. The VERY first thing I do when claiming a workshop is build a stash box, because duh PvP. Lol
---
Barbarian (every point of strength adds +4 DR) is aimed at melee builds due to the strength requirement. Also, the blocker perk under strength reduces incoming melee damage by 45%. Any build can use this card of course, but it’s under strength so many other builds with low strength can’t use it because they have to prioritize their points for other things.

He's mad because he has a set and if enough complaining is done about it his little OP set will be nerfed.
---
Yeah they would, this suggestion is the first item I centered in my feedback response to the call that was put out on the Jan 1 inside The Vault. 
---
There are lots of great ways player buildable containers could be combined with the concept. So containers is another big focus on my feedback.

Poseidon would have been easier, if you could get it.  Monongah is just a scary place.  The overlapping nature of the Workshop and the Powering Up quest, both capable of generating the highest-level enemies, makes it a real pain.
---
I don't blame you though.  Disconnects have always ravaged the usefulness of Workshops, and the fact that Bethesda has made almost zero improvement on this front in the past three months makes their usefulness dubious (the Workshops too).  One thing you can try is pairing up with a friend on a team.  Control of the Workshop will cede to them if something happens to you.

I want this but I don't think they're gonna do it. I resorted to building my foundation as high as possible.

I'm the author of "Creatures and Monsters" on Nexus and I really wanted to make a plugin to pull and use Creature assets from the Fallout 76 directory.

That way you'd have to both games installed, in the correct directories, but after some discussion inside the community and some baseline testing its not only a legal grey area it's not at this time very feasible.

Do you have an Anti Armor exploding combat rifle? Or Furious exploding combat rifle?

Iron fist and incisor are must haves

Yeah, raiding doesn't exist in this game. It not like you can steal stuff.

Respecing should be free at all times.

Trying new builds and optimizing them IS ACTUAL FUCKING CONTENT.

And cheap, too.

I know that it might suck but if you move and replace your base it repairs everything for the cap cost of moving. Depending on how large your base is it can be difficult to set back down but it can save you alot of mats especially flux
---
I've had a few events and hub locations where 3-4 may be in same cell.  The 6-10 was map wide or nuke zone.
---
This. Also, the extra blade mod helps as well. And the twisted muscle mutation.
---
The Vault could be a tunnel to other area. A vault could have a tunnel exit that leads to the left side of the map, which is empty right now.
---
For me it's that annoying state of manageable. Like it's enough in the sense that I can store stuff and play but forget collecting unique items or legendaries. Even building a small armoury for different loadouts for different combat situations is pretty much not possible to do comfortably without sacrificing elsewhere.
---
I'm ok with containers with very restricted item/weight limits but not another several hundred pound stash.
---
I doubt they will either. I like to build in and around structures so I don't often have a choice for where and how high I can place the foundation cause I care more about that part than the shrubs that pop through. But yeah, definitely keep them as high as I can without making them look crazy when I can  👌
---
Sorry you’re eating the downvotes, but yeah, “Knowing Bethesda there are no NPCs” is the stupidest thing I’ve read today, and I’ve been on YouTube...

The guy who leveled my camp had his setup inside white springs right outside of the back of the golf club.   Mine was setup outside of white springs golf course to the south right by the road.   I'm not sure I understand why my camp that far south should cause him problems.  If my camp was there and his couldn't load in there, then he chose to place his camp in a place where his turrets were actively killed mobs other people were trying to kill.   Then instead of server hopping he moved his camp to the most annoying place he could find to piss off the maximum number of people nearby and be within artillery strike range.  
---
Sounds like a right douchebag to me, if that is what happened.   When I load in and someone's camp has taken my spot, I look around, take their food / empty their unlocked resources (because it'll all come back anyway) and I hop to a different server.  No big deal.
---
I don't care if we are over powered or under powered.  I just want it to be consistent.  I can 2-3 shot a level 68 super mutant with a Power Fist, 15 strength and Incisor as my only perk card.  A power fist that weighs next to nothing, has high durability, and uses no ammo.
---
On the other hand there are numerous other weapons I have to empty entire clips into the same super mutant to kill it.
---
Is that the way the game was intended?  Kind of shitty design if you ask me.
---
It’s just an unnecessary burden on players that have grinded their 50-60 levels to get the Ultracite or X-01 armor to have to limp around Appalachia begging and praying for scrap. I’ve got a god Rifle that’s been cucked to a laughably low level and 3 sets of armor in constant disrepair. For the lone players like myself, who enjoyed just stomping around the wasteland wasting monsters and loving it, it really took the steam out of my love for this game. 
---
Seems I’m missing a ton of those :(   Thanks!  I just want fo4 online lol
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **7th Cakeday** bustedchain! ^(hug)
---
Ok, I need this. I can put a deathclaw in my camp, let me put it in x-01 so the PvPers have something to think about if they attack my camp. 
---
my non legendary powerfist does around 210 damage yeehaw
---
Iron fist. Only has a single card unlike rest of the weapons. Incisor and ........drawing a blank on last lol it's the lower weight and higher swing speed. 
---
Twisted muscle doesn't work with unarmed. You want Talons mutation. Also the ninja perk in strength 
---
Where is ur proof that they are focusing on the atom shop instead of the game? Because they are releasing content still? When will people learn, this content was done already, its on a release schedule, they aren't focusing only on it, just releasing content for it. There is no time being taken away from the other activities at this point, when they have exhausted all the done content for the atom store and start working on new content, then ur argument might hold some validity, until then its just nonsense. Much like most of what you said is to be honest
---
Combat armor has some of the best durability in the game. So lasts a long time before it breaks. Other armor types have far less, sometimes Ben less than a third of CA. So it breaks three times as often, hence using more BF to fix. 
---
Sounds like people target that on purpose, so I'm going to put mine away and only use it when I want to.  
---
If you regularly hit the areas where ballistic fiber can be found, or loot every container, you'll always have a surplus.  
---
If your a more casual player, not hitting the "End Game" content (silo's, the bog, etc) you end up finding allot less
---
Talons mutation adds a bleed effect to unarmed.
---
If ur gonna also buy an arm i need resources for that too
---
I forgot to mention I have also tested this route around 20 times and it has worked 100% of the time, if all of the ghouls haven't been killed already that is. :)
---
I don't sell weapons or armor
---
There isn’t any incentive. Plus a lot of people are trying to get plans and resources from the workshops, they just aren’t enticed to pvp because there really isn’t a particularly interesting story or reason.  To be honest, workshops take a lot of resources and the risk just isn’t worth it.
---
If this is true, I will cry. 
---
Such high hopes :\*(
---
Motion assist for chest increases ur carry weight by ten I think
---
I expect nothing less from Bethesda at this point.
---
They can't up the weight in stashes, Mainly because their Engine can't handle it. 
---
Guess I was thinking I did...I keep thinking I’m playing fo4 
---
I'll gladly give that a try.  In the heat of the moment, I didn't even think about that. I had read about it once, but hadn't needed to test it yet.  I'll definitely remember if there is a next time.
---
I was able to get an AUS key for ~10 and activate it via VPN.  Thanks!

I got plans to make marine masks from a random building near watoga they are definitely not only from dev room.
---
Yes, I too have been on Reddit gaming subs within the last week.
---
I send you a message on xbox idk the resource i need but i probably have enough for the arm
---
I agree, as stupid as it may be, I would love to be able to store my Bobble Heads on my shelf in the bedroom of my CAMP
---
Thanks, bot.  That's a really random place to insert your bot generated comment.  lol.
---
I had Serendipity pop up last night while fighting a bunch of Scorched. I don’t own the perk, and had to Google to find out what it was.
---
Are you on pc?  I have 3 or 4 you can have. Send me your ingame name. 
---
My one karma thought was that it could be a system to influence who is possibly behaving hostile toward whom in a more survival like hunger games like mode without the intrusiveness of faction politics dictating everything. It should have a point to being neutral, good, or bad, and then generally result in influencing the interaction and consequences of cooperation or conflict. 
---
You could “steal” from extractors or crops, but that isn’t really a big deal, not what I play for anyway. But raiders do exist, in fact here’s something straight from the wiki on the definition of raiders:
---
“Raiders take whatever they want, whenever they want, and their favorite pastimes are torture and murder.”
---
Sometimes I wonder if we’re all playing the same game lol 
---
+25% damage
---
some vendors still have randoms plan that can show up.
---
I find it's a very sharp upswing in your available ammo. Using scrounger and ammosmith make it a lot easier to use even the more bullethosey guns, but you still need a steady supply of ingredients.
---
Get a couple outposts set up to farm acid, you'll get plenty of cloth from scavenging, and you can make a healthy amount t of gunpowder. My camp is set up on a steel node to get easy access without capturing a base.
---
Also, yes, this games difficulty is based purely on how annoying everything can be. From food to fighting, it's all intentionally wayy to grindy. T60 power armor is really the best way to go for armor vs repair mats. I keep leather pocketed gear in case I'm overloaded and need to hop out and dump inventory, it gives me a solid 50 extra carry weight.
---
Yeah so did and alot of us. But it's a buggy mess with poor weapon balance and worse PvP, if you see a wanted dude not in PA he's got some OP gear. Just go the other way.
---
Also, I like to sell much of my Rad Away / Rad X.  I keep a little bit on hand for emergencies, but I try to make it so my character can handle general amounts radiation on his own.

I accidentally placed a foundation underwater in a pond at my camp and am now unable to remove it, preventing me from building at the spot I'd like. I feel like you should be able to scrap player-built objects through geometry and water to fix these accidents, so you don't have to replace your entire camp.
---
hm, okay that makes sense but they should be stored somewhere else or at least a bit further out.

I've logged in and played twice since last Tuesday's set of patches for less than 4 hours total... And for back ground I've been in game for 4 to 12 hours a day since beta as I recover from an injury (tmi by tired of the judgement on hours played).  
---
In those 4 hours I've seen more griefers, PVP exploiters, and general harassment than I have in the several hundred hours I previously spent in game..  
---
 Really think allot of the causal and friendly players dropped off the map and griefers rule the world (and is supported by a friends list with less and 1/4 the previous players on if)

Dammit, I didn't realize flux would be need for repairs. I'm wishing I wouldn't have bothered now.

Camp attacks in this game- PVP and PVE- are ridiculous anyway.   
---
I've lived in rural areas with wild animals around.
---
They don't just show up one day and start tearing up your generator. 
---
Yeah, it makes sense that a camp would be attacked.  
---
But it makes sense that they'd be attacking the camp's occupant because they see him as food or they want caps. 
---
Would possible reason is there for  a super mutant to stand on the other side of the river, shooting at my generator with a hunting rifle, chipping away at its heath until it is destroyed?   
---
Why would a pack of mongrels bite and scratch  an artillery cannon until it was a pile of rubble?

Buddy Bethesda trolls Reddit, don't advertise :)

Between this and the other guy showing how to curve walls camps it makes me miss the place anywhere mod for FO4. Hopefully they don't 'fix' these things.
---
But glad you read between the lines :)
---
Not a bad idea
---
&gt; I don't even know what 1 is saying for certain, but if it's saying that the high-ROF weapons end up doing the same damage as high-DMG weapons, then it's just blatantly not true due to, well, the content of this entire post.
---
I'm saying that if you run the actual numbers, if you have a pair of weapons where both are hitting the same target that has a relevant amount of armor (i.e. 100 armor after penetration effects vs a 500 damage attack) and one does half the damage of the other (after armor), then it will deal half the damage when the two weapons attack any target with higher armor as well. This also means that against targets where the higher-damage weapon ignores the armor, the lower-damage weapon's damage relative to the high-damage one will actually improve (since the high-damage weapon can't over-penetrate armor to deal extra damage).
---
&gt; That "50 dmg attack hitting 30 times a second" will realistically be doing 12 dmg and hitting maybe 10 times a second (ie minigun). Looking at the chart, that means each shot is doing about 2.2 dmg per hit against something with 100 armor (your average high-lvl super mutant). That means 22.2 dps vs my super sledge slamming into them at 400-500 dps.
---
You're throwing spitball numbers around and looking at the chart, then saying the system *can't* work, with any numbers. I'm saying that the system *can* work, if Bethesda actually goes in and tunes the weapons to fit the system they have in place.
---
The specific two sets of numbers I gave may or may not be actual specific guns at the moment, but they do match their paper DPS within one percent at 500 armor, 2000 armor, and 9999 armor.
---
&gt; And in 3, the real factor that you are leaving out of your theory crafting is accuracy. Sure, the math works that you are putting more damage down range, but chances are you are either firing in bursts or just wildly missing a bunch of your shots.
---
There are definitely other factors (ammo efficiency, accuracy, magazine size and reload time, etc.) that need to be evaluated, but are separate concerns to "FO4's armor system is bad because it favors high-damage/low-RoF weapons".
---
For specific Minigun numbers, a low-optimization build can put it at 25 damage per hit (45% AP) and about 35.7 attacks per second, then swap out perks for an All-Rise that deals 240 damage (75% AP) 6 times every 10 seconds. The paper DPS for the minigun is actually *higher* against all targets (669 vs 143 at 100 armor, 288 vs 142 at 1000 armor, around when the given 240-damage All-Rise actually fully benefits from Incisor 3). The issue with the minigun, then, is **not** basic-level paper DPS. It's in **optimization ceiling** (melee can benefit from boosting STR sky-high, ranged weapons can't, though it should be noted that because it's not over-penetrating armor the minigun should benefit more from Bloodied, Adrenal Reaction, Psycho, etc.), **ammo consumption** (the given minigun depletes its entire drum of 500 rounds in just 14 seconds of sustained fire), and "**gun-feel**" (the minigun takes a moment to begin firing, can be hard to control even with Stabilized, and won't immediately drop weak enemies, while the All-Rise and any other Super Sledge bashes skulls in with almost every swing).
