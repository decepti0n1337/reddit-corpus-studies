I've been using a 10mm for everything except the end game bosses. It's bloody, and I only just started using the pistol perks. It's auto and primed. 
---
It's so good that I put away my combat rifle. Now I"m looking for a bloody, leveled pipe pistol to take advantage of the constant flow of .38 ammo that comes my way.
---
---
---
Not something I've heard of.
---
Season 2 really shouldn't be starting until they fix the auto complete bug, I played every day and I only just made it due to how many dailies and weeklies refused to pay out!
---
I got nothing on my first account I had a support build but I was always playing with a group and it was a joke build never really intended for functionality even had a medic's flamer for extra laughs.   
---

---
If and only IF you could share more than one card would I consider going to 15 charisma 9 is fine.   
---
Well you could also role play a drunk medic taking quack surgeon and party boy/girl, take friendly fire also use a flamer and a shish kabob while raging drunk all the time. Dont forget professional drinker in endurance though
---
Does this make something like the Forest: Wolf Horde drop things that aren't lv20, or will legendaries still be based on zone for level?
---
I've heard from a few testers running bloodied stealth that switching a handful of uny with race armor was a life saver. My wife is a little nervous because she's running bloodied, but I think so long as you're in a team, it's going to be okay!
---
I'd love to be able to rotate all of my camp objects.
---
Sweet!  That's why we keep playing!
---
Right but that is only 2000 gold you'll need 20k or more to get everything you want
---
True but Just remember that things like speed demon, reload magazines, reload perks, and the firework glitch all cut into the effects of quad.
---
Same, same!  The BoS bunker in the  season 2 board is going to be a popular piece.
---
I think I know what you‚Äôre talking about but I don‚Äôt really know how to describe it
---
oh man, goodluck with that!
---
[removed]
---
i believe in you!
---
Man there‚Äôs nothing worse than paying to move my camp and not being able to sit anything down. ‚ÄúNeeds support!‚Äù ‚ÄúItem is floating!‚Äù It literally is not. The only support I need it your support, Bethesda. Support my imagination with my buildings!
---
Level doesn't change pvp much after about level 65. It's all about your gear and perks.
---
i just want like.. camo for the 10mm or maybe gold for the tommy or something
---
Wow that's. Kinda shitty
---
Thats one reason why I changed my game style to savage (witch hunt or watever u like to call it) against these players. But the nice part of me still goes around gifting legendaries and supplies to low levels
---
2k to 2500 hours in. Ive ran QE shotguns and every othee wepon imaginable. Theres no way a QE shotty specced dose more dmg than a BE shotty fully specced. Agree to disagree. Have a nice day.
---
Yes they do,  plug one to 1/2-1/3 health and the health bar goes red and they start attacking. Unlike whitespring it won't aggro the whole area. Ergo with one wasteland trying to fist fight an assaultron in watoga it'll let you beat on it for a bit, then laser your face off
---
Dual wield and a armor penetration perk
---
Same. Haha... i got at least 12 types of fixers with me
---
Yep. Didn't know it was over since it's still there on my menu. Thought it ran till the new one. Thanks tho!
---
Yeah for PS4 just press the touchpad while in the Pip-Boy menu to change it back and forth
---
The fireworks glitch had been fixed in the patch
---
Yea. I guess I can't rely on the launcher and in game stuff like most games. Figured it would remove the game from in game when it was over.
---
As a bloodied build user I'm excited for the coming challenge.
---
I think all skins should be for all armors and weapons.. I got a sweet blood wash paint for the combat armor but dont really use that set.
---
Great for healing. Not something id use 24_7 but good for iss, earl, or similar.
---
They already removed scrip. And there were a lot of people that legitimately farmed their gifts last year. 
---
There‚Äôs a better option to solve the problem than to penalize the honest players that built up their stock. 
---
Lunchboxes were also duped. Should those be nerfed and negatively impact the players that still have a bunch?  
---
And before anyone asks ‚ÄòWhy would the legitimate players still have gifts or pails?‚Äô  My response is ‚ÄòWhy not?‚Äô  Why would they have to have opened them all already?  Why can‚Äôt they decide to hold on to them, for whatever reason?
---
Penalize the players that use dupes. This is a responsibility that Bethesda has mostly ignored, with the only punishments being little more than ‚Äòslaps on the wrists‚Äô.
---
that would be great. imagine a scabber fixer or a blood eagle tommy gun
---
Yeah, thinking about using it for daily ops and bosses and my explo plasma for adds.
---
I claimed a workshop at level 9 having no idea of the PVP consequences.
---
A high level showed up, possibly looking for a fight. Knowing nothing about anything, except that he was acting shifty and that I wasn‚Äôt going down without a fight, I took some shots at him with my level 5 shotgun. Hilarity ensues.
---
His crew shows up, invite me to their team, teach me about PVP and pacifist mode, provide me with armor and weapons, defend my workshop from another player attack, run me through Morgantown airport for the backpack and build out my camp.
---
After their warning about taking workshops I was wary of it for a while, but what‚Äôs the big deal? Maybe you die, which has no consequences, or maybe you have an adventure and meet a new crew?
---
Don‚Äôt pass up any adventures for fear of losing your desk fans, they‚Äôre not worth it!
---
I moved mine into a community of other friends camps but for some reason like 15 blood bugs spawn and just destroy my stuff because my friends go back to their bases a lot
---
Did you initiate a charge back on your credit card?
---
That usually is a quick way to get a company to hate you.
---
Oh, I haven't had that happen since I last ran Vault 79. Random invincibility, sure, but not the super resistance.
---
It's sure something when the glitches have glitches üòÇ
---
Rad x and radaway. you know, the real hard stuff lol
---
Collect junk and sell it to vendors.
---
Use a melee weapon and complete quests.  
---
Most of the daily quests are easy and quick.
---
Use melee weapons whenever possible to reduce ammo use. Use Pharma Farma to gather more Stimpaks. 
---
Look for posts on this sub that address your concerns. There are a lot of solutions.
---
[deleted]
---
If your holding onto them then your not gonna use them to build up caps..... Also if your holding onto to them 9 months after the event ended then I'm sorry but their past the expiration date. Also lunchboxes aren't tradable and don't impact the economy by fucking the currency. Lunchboxes only give xp boosts.
---
Shotgun is not a commando weapon. It doesn‚Äôt spend as much time firing as it does reloading.
---
It is harder to find a non- magical than a regular, because there's a series of prefixes and effects to make them legendary in VATS.
---
Caps are definitely not worthless lol
---
I‚Äôm at max caps. Why should I waste part of the benefit of the gifts?
---
And there is no expiration date. Show me where Bethesda set one.
---
The economy of this game was negatively impacted long before the Holiday event.
---
Storing all of my nocturnal gauss miniguns and ain‚Äôt ghoul ss arms
---
No, i mean the datamined spec ops outfit
---
I am excited too, but just remember to take it with a grain of salt...as is usual there will probably be bugs and new broken things.
---
Exactly. I got tons of skins for guns I never use.
---
Boy have I got news for you
---
Gillie combat rifles or gauss guns
---
Thanks Brothah!!
---
Then they minus well give everyone extra carry weight
---
Please do not quote me but I‚Äôm pretty sure drops and loot will be based off player lvl so the horde in low lvl areas won‚Äôt drop low lvl loot for high lvl players.
---
Thank you for your input.
---
The double barrel. I‚Äôm actually kinda upset about the skins being for the pump and handmade. Why can‚Äôt it be double barrel and .45 smg. Why does the handmade need so many skins.
---
it would be so damn perfect! Like even the damn pickaxe has a skin
---
I've started using vampire weapons for the bosses. Not as much damage but your practically immortal as long as you have ammo.
---
I have the same in Be fro pump combat and double barrel. Whats the point. Plus scattershot. I lost ya. I guess. Sru. Later
---
because i assume they focus on the more popular guns. i dunno, they must know the Handmade meta
---
Not as badly as gifts impacted it. Before gifts being duped people actually did caps trades. Now you go into the big trade subreddits and they'll only do junk or item for item. Presents fucked caps and the only way to unfuck them is to stop presents from giving caps. If your holding onto any gifts 9 months after an event I'm more inclined to say you duped them than you actually saved.
---
I have mine locked all the time but every time I load into a new world they are wide open.
---
I picked what I thought was a low level area no one camps at but is essentially the middle of the map and yup usually got to hop a server
---
My only problem with workshop pvp is that the attacker needs to attack first
---
Capture the easy workshops, do the defense events, do the easy events near the forest, most award stimpaks, should be rolling in them and have to sell for weight reasons.
---
Purified water sells for a few caps, setup a water farm with the small purifiers at your camp. Each will farm 2 water at a time for free. 4 caps each maybe.
---
Upgrade your armor to be level appropriate, armor/weapons/etc are leveled. Especially at the lower levels you will want to recraft every time you hit a 5/10 level boundary.
---
The def do and they most likely had the AR in the game to make the HM look better
---
Step 2 ETA: October 23, 2077
---
I load mine up Vintage Nukashine. When I notice the door has been opened, I always wonder where they‚Äôve ended up. Haha.
---
Use a melee weapon for a bit try to grind legendaries to sell.
---
^ this. 98% of quest reward you with stimpaks and pure water. Stick to the forest and toxic valley (grey north area) for now as kill all the radstags for food. Stick with melee until u have a healty stock of ammo and sell any food about to spoil along with chems ure not using. If you can set up a purified water source in your camp your surplus can also be sold for a nice profit.
---
Farm junk and make your own ammo.  Pretty easy to get supplies.
---
I'm level 28 and have 175 stim packs in my stash. I dont even know where they came from!
---
No no, let him think he made this happen
---
Has me so scared to actually move mine I‚Äôm just not gonna

3 skins to be exact
---
F's in the chat for all those poor souls who have to hold down the fire button for a half second longer
---
maybe it's some cursed pickaxe foreshadowing
---
What makes Whitesprings continue to be a great place to nuke is the variety of flux. The SBQ area is not bad, but then you have to deal with a variety of monsters as well.
---
As another commenter has pointed out pking is part of the lore of this game. It's expected. I honestly thought i was walking into a rage over grief post but you did exactly as the game was designed. You ignored him and then helped the low levels. That's one way of doing it or you could have been a bigger aashat and killed them yourself. Don't worry. You're doing it right.
---
RIP stash.
---
That sounds like a pretty good build to run with. How useful did you find 'sneak' overall? I lived by it in Fallout 4, but I'm weary on putting the time in to set it up in 76 incase I find myself getting seen all the time.
---
See, I have a lot of caps. I didn‚Äôt mind moving. Until I logged in one day, game says ‚Äúcan‚Äôt build your camp, want to move for free or hop servers?‚Äù. I‚Äôm like okay, fine. Needed to move anyway. And when I found a spot *every* *single* *piece* was taken apart and put in storage. Individually. Each wall, stairway, door, floor, ceiling. The entire thing was dismantled. ;w; I haven‚Äôt moved my camp from the southern part of the Savage Divide since
---
Well, if you got their name, just report them if you haven't already done so.
---
No they dont
---
I wish I had paid with a credit card üòì but I used cash to buy a prepaid card for my Xbox when I subscribed
---
I remember when I was this behind on fallout news
---
The local tab is everyone in your server, and personally I do not think the Global is too busy, and it helps you find groups doing nukes and stuff, plus once you meet and add enough people you will notice that a lot of the text chat users hangout in the same servers, that way local chat actually is populated. Obviously not as good as just having it natively, but I would not call it hot garbage.
---
Why do the full job when you can release it half assed and fix it a year later....because Bethesda
---
Up vote this shit
---
Ah , bugs are coming either way. I just don't have time to get mad about it, haha.
---
The ridiculously hilly terrain sure is true to WV.
---
Clever foundation placement can take you far, gotta use those slanted ones to gain altitude.  Suprised by how nice some camps look built on a large base of foundations. Looks like a little town area with paved roads or courtyard and is a refreshing escape from the hilly terrain.
---
&gt;I played every day and I only just made it due to how many dailies and weeklies refused to pay out!
---
You'd think that after the first time, you would have googled it or gone on reddit and said to yourself "gosh golly it might be a good idea not to remain online when the challenges switch over to the next day!"
---
Difference in damage is barely noticeable. Keep it or sell it for 30K. And if no one buys it, use it to clean all rooms and do all events.
---
You got it, $4.99 and then it'll take 4 different rare materials to craft.
---
Well I'm sorry that I was the one to point it out to you haha
---
If PC allows movement via keyboard controls (or. Point and click moves to the spot clicked) I could envision this on PC - go to disposal site when there is no event, move from point A to B while recording a macro.  Test it to make sure it works And your pathing is good.  If it does, Configure the macro to loop, 
---
with a break command issued on a certain keystroke.
---
Start the macro, go AFK.
---
  IDK about the damage aura, unless it was something like reactive plates, Tesla coils, or electrically charged mutation.
---
Unfortunately it costs perk coins to swap legendary cards in and out!
---
I believe so
---
I wasn't, the auto complete can happen at ANY Time!
---
I'll take some pails.. wasn't here for that event and would like to try and get those event outfits.
---
But at least your lawn looks pretty okay!
---
What are you going to do about it? You paid Bethesda 2 years for something that we all know a few months in was always going to be at least this bad. So are you actually done as in any subs cancelled and you stop playing the game done?
---
You are aware you can sell them, or move them to mules right....(down voting the truth, fucking sad)
---
Ikr, Just take it slow though &amp; really consider what you‚Äôre scrapping.
---
More intelligence for my heavy gunner and more luck for my commando!
---
Yes. Definitely agree. Removing core game mechanics just fucks over the balance even more.
---
I‚Äôm talking about automatic rifles. Shotguns aren‚Äôt automatic rifles. Although the Double barrel is a good example of the phenomenon. A QE DB is better than a BE dB because it can get off 8 shots and reload in the time it takes the be to get off two and reload. Auto rifles are effected by the same phenomenon.
---
This game is a hoarding game, Bethesda just put limits on hoarding for no reason other than forcing daily log ins for their reporting. How do you not see that? Their predatory mechanics led them to introduce restrictions on how much progress can be made per day so that players are forced to log playtime daily.
---
Every aspect of gameplay pushes the player to collect more. Every update they add new weapons that you have to grind for. This is especially true since the addition of craft-able legendaries with Wastelanders. You have to not only store enough junk to be able to mass craft pieces of armor and weapons, but also have enough legendaries that you can turn in to get scrip for modules or vault steel. There are players who have rolled thousands of these pieces to get a full set that remotely suits their build, do you know how many resources that takes? On the other side you also have to keep a good amount of caps so that when events like mole miners or holiday scorched roll around you can buy pails to farm the rare plants and items. But sure, just leave that stuff laying on the ground. You shouldn‚Äôt even sell it for caps, just let it disappear on server reset.
---
OP suggest a simple mechanic that could solve the issue while still allowing Bethesda to force players to play daily for those precious log ins, but here you come telling him that the smallest thing Bethesda could do to be more consumer friendly is completely absurd.
---
This is the answer. My full set of Marine Unyielding is better than my SS set with 3 Unyielding pieces. My usual numbers are 350 300 110. A leaded backpack and I am at 200 RR too.
---
SS is good because Jetpack.
---
Quad was always a good option because of the amount of damage you could do between reloads you'd have to do with a normal weapon. Since the damage changes are proportional, it'd like be about as good as it was before.
---
However, something funky is going on with explosive effects right now that could make it stand out ahead of what you'd normally expect. Something to keep an eye on.
---
Settlements was the worst thing to happen to the Fallout franchise.
---
yes. it would take you two seconds to check in game tbh
---
Don't buy stims and ammo from NPCs or those trainstation machines unless you're cap rich and dgaf. Hit up player camps. Worth the fast travel cost. You don't always need stimpacks. If you're not in a fight, drink purified water. Put it in your favorite wheel. Build a water purifier or two or twenty in your camp. You can sell what you don't use to npc vendors. Don't forget to lock em though, at least while you're living in digital poverty. Anything that isn't locked in a camp is considered intentionally shared. 
---
Definitely craft your own ammo, get Ammo Smith(agility) and Super Duper(luck) perk cards.
---
I farmed them on my private world. One collectron at each workshop. Rotated constantly throughout them all to collect the gifts. Ran Big Bend Tunnel about once an hour. 
---
And I‚Äôve saved them to give as gifts (shocking, I know) to friends, family and new players I meet. I even bought the gift emote to add in some flair.
---
Yes, some people duped them. ***I didn‚Äôt.*** And you can take that accusation and shove it into Fissure Prime. 
---
You want the economy to be fixed?  Urge Bethesda to address the duping issues instead of penalizing legitimate players. 
---
I built up over 1000 gifts during the event. I didn‚Äôt get anywhere near that with pails, since there wasn‚Äôt a Collectron to assist, or a localized area that constantly spawned the Treasure Hunter Mole Miners. 
---
What you‚Äôre proposing is a bandaid. 
---
And you can *already* get infinite caps legitimately without duping.  So all this would do would be to force the dupers to use that method instead of this one. 
---
You might have good intentions but you don‚Äôt understand the economy as well as you think you do.
---
Cool. I know my experience at 2000 hours and countless testing. But you do you. You win. Have a nice day!
---
I really believe that at this point, every fallout character is addicted to stimpscks
---
Yeah sent them screenshots and all
---
I've read a little about this isn't this going to let you respec?
---
The game will get easier for you in 2 days. Fo76 can be hard for lower levels who run into high level monsters, in two days they'll fix that for you.
---
Then you won't run out of ammo.
---
In my early gameplay I accidentally tried to claim someone else‚Äôs workshop, immediately got taken out. Understandable. I‚Äôve been attacked over my own workshops once or twice since, and I really wish I could just volunteer to give them up. I won‚Äôt complain about it but I just don‚Äôt care to fight back against other players.
---
I'd prefer if they didn't. Hellfire Armor is one thing, since it's locked behind countless Battle Royale hours. But to openly offer a series favorite weapon engraved with a sigil that won't be designed for another eighty years? I feel like it would be egregious. Riot Gear doesn't count, since it's... well, riot gear. The NCR didn't invent it, they just wore it.
---
Settlements was the best thing that happened to the fallout franchise.
---
You know who else remembers...?
---
You can get lucky with some dupers, I bought the plans for about 1500 each. I just hand the outfits out to low levels.
---
Lucky hole mine
---
Theres a second round coming so youll get another chance. Not sure when but its been on the test servers. Apparently they have rewaorked the loot table for it and taken out a lot of the mounted hea d plans and other crap and increased the chances a little bit. So you should have better luck at getting them too
---
Well..therein lies the problem right? Stability and performance of their servers. Maybe...just maybe slow down the new atom shop content and focus on that instead?
---
Go to lucky hole mine with an excavator power armor and mine the lead ore, then smelt it at a chemistry station with super duper on and you‚Äôll get a lot, I usually get around 1k each run
---
I have the exact same minigun as you üòÇ
---
To be honest, The settlement building was done better in the RTS mod for Fo3 where Bethesda got the idea from, They should have had a caravan trading company have you go to 1 of 2 places on the map in Fallout4 &amp; have u clear it out &amp; establish a trading hub, Every single player fallout game had a smaller first town on the way to the bigger city, You got to diamond city &amp; went ‚ÄúWell this sucks, Can‚Äôt wait to see the bigger city‚Äù only to be disappointed. I hope you get your issues resolved &amp; can find some worth in the game.
---
Bullshit. The only autocomplete issues active even since the PTS were being online during challenge reset times. It's a simple issue with a simple solution, and it ain't my problem that you're too simple to understand that.
---
I don‚Äôt disconnect a lot I just get fucked overüòÇ
---
Tangentially related: So many camps fill their punch bowls and NK machines with Nukashine that no one has drank from my punch bowl in months and it‚Äôs full of rare alcohols (no nukashine). Maybe I should get the pristine machine instead.
---
I saw absolutely nothing. I thought first it was a guy that was stealth and sniped them, but there was only this guy running around. He ran to a place and stood still for a moment until he swapped to next area. Only hands, no weapons or movement. I thought first maybe its visual bug but enemies died on spawn even after he was gone. It was very clear some hack. You just heard the sound of enemies dying everywhere, and you saw nothing. I got zero xp, and there was only me, the hacker and one other low level guy. So 3 guys in this event and we couldnt even kill one mob , and we tried. I even stood waiting for the mobs on spawn, but they died before my arrow hit.
---
Don't have super duper or excavator power armor
---
I live the content written for the new characters.  The last new toon I made, I ran out to the point of launching, and then started the Wastelander expansion.  I tell you that in order to admit that I have a problem.  I have accounts for PC ( FO1st) and for the XB1, I have 7 toons, around 400 levels scattered amongst them, and almost 1100 hours played since the 2ns Beta day.  All that being said, start a new toon, start hunting Scorchbeasts like the season just opened, build interesting houses, or start drunken brawls at Biv's; whatever you decide, HAVE FUN!

I believe mods are random for where they appear to be found or bought. You could always make a load of smgs and scrap them (use backwoodsman #3 to cut down materials needed)

Them addressing the duping issue won't fix the fact the presents are already in game. The only way to fix that is too wipe anyone with absurd amounts of gifts. I've been trading since beta man I know how the economy got fucked post the gift dupe. What I'm proposing is a fix to caps losing value. Your 1000 gifts you "farmed" will still provide junk, aid, and misc stuff. They just won't provide caps. If your giving them away as gifts to friends, family, and new players they won't care that they didn't come with caps.

This, i run full health and literally cant be killed by the adds with earl when running solo. Worst case is reload, which to my benefit I just jump a bit while reloading and that is that.

Why are fallout 76 players even allowed to post on Reddit? Making a one-star complaint shitpost guarantees that the most valuable thing I‚Äôll find on Reddit are the cat pictures at the end and the porn in the chest. We really should be restricted to no posts allowed seeing as our community is full of a fair amount of crybabies.

I‚Äôm not even sure what you are disagreeing with me about. I think you are just misunderstanding me. By the way how on earth did you get 2000 hours logged on the PTS? That‚Äôs a real feat. I didn‚Äôt even think this patch had been up this long.

Yeah Im really hoping I get the plans for the outfits at least next time around. Those and the Marine helmet one. i forgot to mention above they are also adding some new items. I think new outfits and some other stuff. I have no idea what they look like though.
---
That's been fixed for a while my guy
---
Oh Goddamn this shit is the Bible! Now if we could turn it into an app...
---
I like lever actions.  They do a good amount of damage, especially the explosive ones :)
---
Hip fire has good accuracy, ammo is relatively easy to find.
---
A silenced suppressors explosive lever is my goto for sniping.
---
On the other side of things, almost every workshop I've had has been attacked by people lv150+, and every time it happens it ends up in an instakill because I don't have good armor yet since legendary boxes are a curse. 
---
My last run-in with a pvp person, they instakill me while I'm just chilling at Thunder Mountain, I respawn to get fair shots, but their what I can only assume was a 2 shot Gauss Minigun + SS Jetpack didn't care since my prime gatling did some 13 per hit iirc. Didn't even take the workshop let alone my junk, they just left the server after that.
---
That's my problem with workshops, take the workshop for all I care, but blindside killing with op weapons purely to kill ruins it. I wouldn't have problems with it, but pvp balance is non existent. Don't get me wrong, I've had some good pvp fights for the ammo factory around launch, but recently it's just been anti-fun.
---
Pretty much! Did I mention they were still in their vault suits with no armor? Sigh.
---
Fixer skins please
---
Platform?
---
On a PS4 I always suggest sounds a "rebuild database" after any of that sort of weirdness. Also sometimes my PS4 pro cooling fans will spin up intensely for no good reason in certain settings. I think it's because I have super sampling enabled for the game. There are a few places where the rendering box is just way wrong and full of crap, particularly the basement of the overseers house. So watch for that sort of heating.
---
On a PC that's usually a driver problem when your screen goes totally wonky like that. The file system defrag may improve your lot.
---
On both platforms it seems to have something to do with encountering any sort of delay loading textures. Windows has a particular bug where it can say that a file region has been mapped into memory when it's only in the cache and the mapping isn't actually stable yet. I'm pretty sure this is very close to the problem that I have on the PS4 in lots of games if the database is stale. I think there's something inherently flawed in some of the multi-threading code where some data loading thread will pass some marginally initialized memory image into the rendering pipeline.
---
The various and sundry defrag operations tend to prevent this because they leverage operating system level read ahead better.
---
It's a completely black box analysis, but it seems to hold true.
---
And Sony themselves describe the rebuild database feature as a way to get rid of a lot of semi-random and inexplicable behaviors. Not in so many words, but almost.
---
For the PS4 you power off, hold down the power button until it beeps once and then a second time, plug in your controller and turn it on, and select rebuild database from the menu. It warns you that it could take several hours but it usually finishes in four or five minutes. If it takes longer than four or five minutes you definitely needed to do it very badly.

I live in a shack...down by the river... No shit i have a wooden shack down by the river behind wayward...
---
I have a explosive executioners vats one I‚Äôd be willing to trade or sell, It does more damage the lower the health of enemy is.
---
they just need to change a few things in the code to enable combat rifle skins for the fixer
---
I do too.
---
Though it seems Daily Ops is kinda meh with stealth, so I‚Äôm switching gears to non-stealth.
---
But I‚Äôd still love to be able to wear something overtop the stealth armor.
---
If you see it up monster mash has been really generous with the 3 stars for me lately.

People still escape the cave for that worthless chest? Stay and loot the wendigos and you'll leave with as much ammo as you entered with. And a shit ton of screws. Much more valuable than the garbage in that chest.
---
That‚Äôs another one that can get tons of bullets down the range when quad.
---
It‚Äôs not a glitch, it‚Äôs a feature. And it just works.
---
I had basically the same experience but in reverse, I got my ass handed 2 me by 3 high levels at ammo factory and my base destroyed. Instead of fearing pvp I focused on getting stronger than the ppl who killed me and that's what I did. Also got very bored of shooting the same boss. All the bosses are basically just reskins with difficulty levels.
---
It's hard to balance heavies. In a perfect world, you can barely change direction with a heavy firing, which means you need to commit to the direction you're firing. This makes it less viable on Scorchbeast until she lands and evne thens he scootles her bootle around like a fucking cockroach. The ammo for heavies also needs to cost more to make, plain and simple. Heavy weapons are powerful enough on a base level that no newb max level character should be able to mass produce them as easily as we can. 
---
Melee I've only seen hav eproblems because of the same reason EVERY OTHER WEAPON TYPE has problem, Junkies and Bloodied. Nerf those two into the fucking dirt. Seriously, fuck Bloodied builds, all of them. Commando i hardly hear about it being a problem, but i'm sure it is.
---
Absolutely ecstatic for One Wasteland. It‚Äôs going to be great being able to play with my lower levels friends properly!
---
I‚Äôve been playing and trading since BETA as well. I‚Äôve never duped, and I‚Äôll thank you to stop making that accusation unless you have some evidence to the contrary. 
---
Removing another benefit of the gifts is a detriment to those that have them legitimately. By this logic, why not wipe all characters and make everyone start back at level 1?  Because that would impact *too many* legitimate players?
---
How many legitimate players is too many to impact negatively?  Where do you want to draw the line?  10?  100?  1000?
---
And infinite caps are still obtainable, and through a legitimate non-duping method. 
---
The economy will not noticeably improve with your plan. All it would do is make it more time-intensive to get to max caps, because there is *still* a way to get infinite caps,
---
I live in a shack... By the river... No really all ive done is build a wooden shack with all my tables in it down by the river behind wayward

There exists a house &amp; bunker in the mire that no one really knows off
---
All the data coming out od the public test server, weapons, weapon mods, perks, legendary effects, food/drink/chem buffs all providing much lower damage than they do now.

Melee, pistols and rifles have been hit the hardest due to their slow attack speed!

Bethesda's new motto: our features have features!
---
Respeccing has been available for a long time now, so I'm not sure what you mean ?
---
Oh, yes please!
---
No. Perk loadouts are coming with Fractured Steel.
---
I'm sure someone could.  Just throw a copy in your drive and you'll always have it.
---
Can i build it on my friends CAMPS?(My guess is no).
---
You mean at 50 where you can put point from one stat to another?
---
Because as proven by the fact that we own this game: sometimes people just own some things of *very* questionable quality.. üòî
---
No
---
Also, if that's the case why the fuck am i working on a second character?
---
Seems fair
---
They changed how the entire power system worked, it was always a built in, sustained power source, as well as how the armor was designed to fit, id say that's a pretty big change. And this model changes even more because of the addition of the frame, that tells me there's now no mechanical bits in the armor itself, and it's all in the once-was-recon-armor frame, meaning what the NCR supposedly did to their salvaged power armor is impossible or highly pointless because the frame is what has the mechanical systems and the frames are separate from the armor pieces.
---
What system and name of the abuser? It's in the new Rules from Bethesda parent company that will not be tolerated, did you know that?
---
This is what I do. Works like a charm, now I can have my light white instead of that horrid green.
---
I have never had this issue. I always find a point where the water isnt the priority and can loot the body.
---
It would have been okay if it was just building a trade hub for a caravan &amp; U picked where on the map if would be out of a couple locations but we got was far inferior, There wasn‚Äôt a single location that I wanted to build at, No pre existing farm or bank vault or anything particularly cool.
---
I‚Äôd argue 1H melee is satisfying with the right weapon.  My two primary weapons are a Vampire switchblade and a SS ghoul slayers switchblade.
---
The ghoul slayers just melts the mob at RR.  Unmodded by foods/chems/bobbles, it on hits L42s and 2-3 hits L62 charred.  (3 hits in about a second, by the way.)
---
Vampire is not too far behind, but that one does not have the swing speed star.
---
Also have a mutant slayer switchblade, but don‚Äôt use it very often because the vampire one usually does the job.  The toughest SMs to take out are the L68s with miniguns - getting close enough before the minigun gets you is the hardest part.
---
For the SBs that have decided to go toe to toe when I had the switchblade in hand....they did not survive.
---
 (But I generally switch over to a vampire gatling plasma for them)
---
Have a SS hunters combat knife.... that one has taken out more than onE L91 glowing deathclaw.
---
Do tell....
---
The only people who have ever attempted to fight me at my workshops have blasted me instantly before I can even see them. A level 40 guy who can kill me in one hit? I call shenanigans on that one. The only people I've ever seen pvp seem to be hacking.
---
Do you just mean being able to move perk points? Because yeah, that‚Äôs been an option for some time now.
---
Just like real communism, they tend to kill their own people as well.
---
Yea but is it something you can do before it after 50? Ive read something like that but not sure.
---
Oh no, you need to get to level 50 first, at least I *think* so
---
South of the Braskins? medical supply building, It‚Äôs extremely easy to miss
---
Oh boo-hoo. My solo sbq is going to take 20 seconds instead of 10! How could they have done this? I'm leaving.
---
it only unlocks after killing 1100 robots with unarmed weapons.
---
So I can be on the other end of the map and still receive the effect?
---
This guy crouches, bro.
---
I see no flaws in this logic
---
Yea, definitely acts/sounds like a macro for the movement part.
---
No explanation for the damage, beyond the oberserration I‚Äôve had enemies die immediately on respawn in several different locations, but never during an event (PS4, btw).
---
Wait so the new supermutants have magic lasers??
---
Eh that‚Äôs the same question I had about the communist fence. Why give us the fence and not the gate as well. I‚Äôm using a regular gate as my entrance and it looks so out of it place between the communist fence
---
I'm only starting with the Gauss Minigun, and the mods I saw added up to only 1k gold. For now, the worst part IS the Rep Grind. Can't even see the bar move when it goes up.
---
At least when that event is glitched, it absolutely tanks the FPS
---
It use to work like that, not sure if they have broke it, as they have with many mutations, perks and the rest. haven't tryed it lately. But if its the same and not broke then yes
---
in early game try and use a melee weapon as much as you can
---
you fix weapons at a weapon repair bench which you can find in peoples camps or build your own or dotted around the map. You can put points into a perk called gunsmith which makes your guns last longer. Probably worth a point or two tbh
---
I done did crouch many a time. I tbagged the water so much the dude that comes with the raider thief was like, bro that ain‚Äôt some irradiated splash pad. I killed him after he gave me that face, but the thingy thing Ward wanted remained in the water.
---
...get them
---
I believe the word you are looking for is "extreme scavenger"
---
Two.
---
Where?
---
You can fix them at workbenches but you need junk to do so. I would try using a melee weapon if you're running out of ammo.
---
You can also make ammo at tinkerer bench, which also costs junk.
---
I mostly focused on one-handed melee up to this point because I liked Black Diamond and The Gutter. I have All Rise now as a starting point if I want to transition to two-handed melee. As tempting as unarmed is, I probably won't focus on it because I do plan on setting up for Power Armor either way. The no Power Armor perks have served me well up to this point, but I feel like I would benefit more from having Power Armor during the high level events.
---
Or just let us build vaults.
---
What happens to the weight? Will I be able to play or hoard junk, or will I have to dump those 10k+ of junk to continue playing? Do they stay safe in the scrapbox, I can take them out but not put them back in?
---
You think junkies explosive will hold up?
---
Bethesda doesn't give two shits about what players want. All they want is your atom business.
---
Try practicing on the fertile soils event. There are three ghouls in the basement and can kill them right at the stairs. You can loot even in the water. Little water, lots of water, doesnt matter.
---
Barrel drop? That's how u know I never get above 2 lol
---
Because it makes the game last longer? Simple as that
---
Facts
---
Go to a weapons workbench.  Use the option on the right at the bottom of the screen.  Allows you to repair the weapon.  Although, at level 15, it‚Äôs almost easier to toss that weapon and pick up a new one.  
---
As for ammo...the .308 hunting rifle and pump shotgun are your friends.  Alternate between the two as you have ammo for one or the other.  Use a Board whenever possible to conserve ammo further.  Puncturing on a board is effective.  
---
As you get closer to level 50 your build will start coming together and be more effective.  Until then you just use whatever is available.
---
Yeah they stay in the scrap box and yea you can take it back out just can't put stuff back in when it ends üñí
---
So super duper is a luck perk unlocked at level 50.  Excavator power armor is from a quest called Miner Miracles.  To start it go to the garrahan headquarters  in the ash heap, lower left of the map.
---
Yes I am and I have, but why is the system designed this way to begin with?
---
Griefing has partially ruined this game for me. It has caused me to dislike and completely ignore most players, even if they‚Äôre seemingly being nice or just saying hello. If somebody tries to give me something, follows me around or is around my CAMP or workshop for too long, I simply leave the server and find another.
---
I don‚Äôt trust others because of my griefing experience, and I‚Äôm not paying for Fallout 1st, as I believe it should be free. Having all of your stuff taken and called horrible things when you‚Äôre a low-level is enough to make somebody isolate themselves.
---
At teir 4,you have a chance for the radiation barrel plan, it's an intractable radiation source for your camp! Great for Bloodied builds.
---
Ah, well.. that wont happen. I get far too distracted playing to manage that in 2 days.
---
So that's how you get the barrel. I just saw it today and u wanted it but didnt now how, thx
---
PvP? What PvP? Hundreds of hours &amp; I've yet to be ganked by anyone.. vanilla stv anyone? üòâ
---
Baffled by the people saying fallout doesn‚Äôt have hoarding elements? One of the main selling points of its Paid subscription model is an unlimited Storage bank, like ??
---
You can also get that blue radiation suit, but it's glitched and can't be repaired!
---
Then what is your answer? You seem to be defending the system. Why do you support the current legendary system? Because as long as your answer is ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the system Bethesda decided on‚Äù this conversation can never go anywhere.
---
I dunno. Something about it seems interesting and I enjoy finding the things to set the table.
---
Well think about it: Bethesda allowed players to wear apparel items over armor to provide players more opportunities to express themselves. This is essentially the same thing only with another item.
---
Even at 20% with the right set up you won't die, but you do way more damage
---
A neurodivergent robosexual? Yeah, I can see her being as amusing as any of the current allies. Bonus points if she starts audibly breathing harder when telling us we have to go somewhere robot-themed for her quests. Played for laughs, not pervy like.
---
I‚Äôve been exclusively playing with my level 35 character for the last week so I‚Äôm used to what lower damage output feels like. The game is still massively fun and I enjoy having to work a little harder to clear mobs. That said, the Earle fight is no fun without massive damage output, haha.
---
Oof
---
Because respeccing hurts the number of perk coins you have. 
---
Also because some of us have a heavy weapons guy (str focus) and a rifle guy (perception) or any number of builds that we want to play, and you really don't want to respec every time you want to use a different gun. If you did that, you would destroy your character.
---
Hey, those 10k screws will really come in handy one day, just you wait ;)
---
It‚Äôs to encourage you to play longer and buy more atoms.ü§î
---
Perhaps the body fell through the map then. I am very accustomed to looting through various water levels- I‚Äôve played since day 1 and had a camp where I‚Äôd kill spawns by a river near sunshine farms (junk pile) and I loot with no problems there. This kill was in a stream in the mire by the Dolly Sods Wilderness- plasma gun used but no goo found from where target died to where body fell on death.
---
This is true for any live service game because as soon as they have a new update, new and old bugs are introduced back in.
---
In a way it‚Äôs like crime.  The cops can‚Äôt ever eradicate it.  The best they can hope for is a huge investment of resources aimed at a concerted strike on the major gang or drug lords , put a few guys in jail, and enjoy a bit of quiet for a couple months.  Someone else comes along to fill the vacuum and nothing has changed.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Halloween smoke machine is coming back soon, and it has bats flying around in the smoke!
---
My answer doesn‚Äôt matter. It won‚Äôt change a thing. And I lm ok with that.
---
Apparently lol.. check out the end of angry turtles live stream from last night.
---
If you really really want the body, whip out an explosive weapon or some grenades and literally blow it out of the water.
---
I don‚Äôt run around with pacifist either. If I do shoot someone, it‚Äôs on purpose.
---
I find her more amusing than any of the current companions. Her quest line could be to find that servo she talks so highly about
---
I have seen too many with the wrong setup then. I enjoy running solo, and not doing food/chem/etc to get max damage or keeping from death. I go to earl solo with 100 stimpacks, I leave with 120. I dont use them while ablr to put full focus on a target and get out of the mine with about 5 to 10 minutes left normally. So im not hurting to do more damage and feel my build is right for what it is.
---
Ha, thought I just rolled the perfect magic shotgun... till I released what I thought was a  Short Combat Shotgun, was a Short Combat Rifle.
---
It was nice to feel excited for that short while..
---
I'd like the ability to either hide or favorite them. I have some that I don't necessarily want to scrap because I figure I might use them down the road, but it would be nice for them not to clutter up my view when I'm swapping things out.
---
Tank Killer is a great perk card for a rifleman build. I wish it would cripple like enforcer does for shotguns but it staggers pretty regularly, especially with a semi-auto so I bet a full auto would stagger a bunch
---
Or maybe strangler heart
---
Or you know maybe I don't have the cards and am trying to decide if I should buy them.
---
Is this a pc thing? On console you can't join people from the recent list, only people on your friends list!
---
Do NOT take Survival Shortcut if it's just to make eating/drinking simpler.  It's not coming in this update but it's been confirmed by one of the reps that they're still moving forward with revamping eating and drinking to remove the negative effects and focusing just on the buffs, so eventually you won't have to worry about eating and drinking just to keep the bars filled at all.
---
The only other thing I could think of is you didnt kill that body you found and the actual kill was elsewhere. This happens to me sometimes when doing runs in high grass area and cant find mine, but there are dead bodies I cant loot. But you would see the loot box still. So Im not sure.
---
Haha oh absolutely, I‚Äôm totally with you on the scripting notes idea as well
---
I thought the seedy shed was a great way to protect my radiation shower because if it dies the rad shower vanishes without breaking.
---
But if people leave the door open dogs just rush inside instead!
---
At level 15 you're better off just finding a new one and scrapping the old. I used to carry multiples of weapons and just junking the broken ones as I went along. Once you start modding them, maybe hold on to them a bit longer but you're still going to even outgrow them every 10 levels until 45-50.
---
even the perks are kinda bad.
---
Like gun runner is completely pointless if you have speed devil (and who doesn't have speed devil) or use squad maneuvers.
---
Packin' Light's effect are far below the par set by Scattershot (reducing the weight more and an secondary effect) and Martial Artist (slightly less weight reducation but a real good secondary effect).
---
Modern Renegade is also below par with ONLY a 4% chance to cripple a limb vs 15% on rifle's and shotgun's 30% meaning you can't bank on it in a fight (and against LASER FACE BEAMS OF DEATH bots,  that's the prefer tactic). Not to mention the hip fire accuracy does not synergize with Crack Shot's bonuses
---
Getting Tank Killer will fix that lack of armor pen and stagger chance at least so that's a plus, hopefully they make ground pounder affect automatic pistols as well in the future.
---
It'll be okay! What's so bad about using more bullets? Game is way too easy as it is right now and if doesn't hold up, oh well. I'll just have the third or 4th highest DPS build.
---
But it does the exact opposite. Once I finish maxing out scrip, I simply move on to another game until my reserves run low enough or I reach the scrip limit. If it really was about play time, then they would encourage players to recycle as many legendaries as possible.
---
My guess? I think the existing system was made when legendaries were rarer, as a compliment to the existing legendaries system. Now that the purveyor has become the main source of legendaries outside of boss events, I think some upgrades are in order.
---
Right now, a power fist usually kills things before Furious gets to even be of any use, but after the nerf on Tuesday that might be more useful.
---
I've been hit by more players at Lakeside Cabins in the last two weeks than ever before. 
---
Most don't even take the workshop is what I think is weird.
---
Do our camp defenses scale as well?
---
That was my thought maybe furious weapons can handle the weapon multiplier revamp
---
Exactly. Those 3 woodchucker cards may save your life one day.
---
Also: world stuff dont respawn until you've looted like 280 other items.
---
So if your first item was a lead weight, that lead weight will only respawn again if you pick it up again as your 281st item, on a fresh world no less.
---
There's some variation in the number. Some will say it's lower. 280 is the conservative estimate and will guarantee a respawn, as long as no one picked it up before you got there!
---
Actually there is a free states one
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
They buffed the defenses but it might not be enough depending on your level
---
The mire is your spot, tons of cool places to put ur camp if you don't mind the lack of foot traffic
---
start selling them to vendors lol..  that what i do and what i'll prob keep doing once the update goes live and we have even more legendares
---
Those folks need to play GTA Online so they know how good they‚Äôve got it in Appalachia.
---
Multiplitive. So AA + incisor ignores 87.5% armor
---
Still less overall damage though, instigating is apparently king of melee now.
---
I'm hoping I can have both built at once.
---
Is the crit meter full?
---
Once you press the button, your next shot you fire will be a crit.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can show you the other two locations and yea you can launch 3 in a server but then the silos will have about 3hr cool down
---
junk wall?! anyone has a pic?! i didnt see it on last tuesday preview
---
okay then. two seconds to check after you buy the card =0
---
Each Server has 3 silos and when a nuke is launched from one, it locks and goes on cooldown. You can check the status of the silos to see if you can raid one, cause they won't all be open at all times.
---
Nukes are unlimited you can lunch up 3 nukes in one server . Then you have to wait like 2 hours to relaunch anther one on in other server or wait for the cool down .
---
All of it is going to cool!
---
They have been out for a while just now got around to using them.
---
Especially the outfit tho. Just wait until Tuesday.
---
Search up the photomode glitch, you can skip the reactor room and mainframe room
---
We just need double sided-paintable walls, really.
---
So let me see if I have this straight...every SERVER has 3 silos...now does the nuke count go towards the server as a whole? Or to the person? I‚Äôm assuming to the server as a whole so I can trigger one for ACP, jimmytwoshoes can trigger one for SBQ and so on, but after the three nukes are launched....there is a server cool down...not an individual player cool down?
---
I personally prefer non-flat places, I have my camp based around a little wooden bridge to the west-northwest of johnsons acre, that goes over a ravine with a stream thru it and is entirely unreachable from the east except thru that crack in the cliffside, allowing for some very unique buildings to be made into a sort of fortress
---
Oh duh, thank you. Yeah was filled, didn't realize it wouldn't take the shot when you hit space. A little diff than FO4
---
I also have PS4 pro, my ratio 7-3
---
They dont come as crates into your inventory. Theyre opened when you buy them
---
NP ,once used to it i MUCH prefer "live" vats, with the exception that you cant store multiple crits.
---
Takes some getting used to
---
This I don't bother turning in armor to the scrip machine anymore because I always end up with some leftover amount I can't claim.
---
I agree. Duped presents out number those that were earned legit. My guess is that Bethesda will have them expire before the Holiday 2020 event.
---
If you're looking for the plans to a few outfits that may fit your bill, try the building in Harper's Ferry that spawns Marine armor plans. I've repeatedly found flannel shirt and t-shirt plans there, so it's worth a try.
---
Also the green shirt and combat boots sometimes spawns at the building's top, as well as a few missiles and a random chem.
---
:( thats unfortunate to hear. I'm around 20-0, maybe closer to 30-0 now. He's never even glitched into floor or ceiling.
---
The only flat good areas are like the bog and white springs
---
Sometimes people and developers over think things and miss the obvious solutions. Or maybe they took a lazy path for time sake. I've no idea what the case or their reason is but I'd like to know. I wish their community engagement contained more of that... share with us not necessarily the how but sometimes the why would be nice.
---
Maybe say we picked this idea of that one and we did so because we felt...
---
I think it would help the community feel closer to the game that many love.
---
Most of them I started
---
yea man and only 2-3 effect are worth even selling it to other players.. 
---
just NPC the rest
---
Oh well, they retroactively removed the legendary perks from the free radicals masks that player so ‚Äúlegitimately‚Äù earned.
---
Yup! Quad clip is 40 bullets. At max commando damage perks, each bullet does mid 200 damage. Auto receiver gives fire rate of 75. That's around 9000dmg in 10 secs without leaving vats.
---
Cooldonw it's per person 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours per person . And if you lunch one nuke on the mine first then the fisher side , it will trigger both events
---
I think James Garret at the Atomic Wrangler could help her with that ;)
---
Sweet cuz i might not have a spare armor piece with it. . Yet. Have you tried it with and compared?
---
Wow, never been said ten million other times in previous posts...
---
Honestly where the hell is the silver submachine gun skin. 
---
Amateur inventor or hot rod gatling laser could also be easily done but nope.
---
Oh shit so I CAN actually launch a nuke right now even though we just did 3 events via other players nuke launches???
---
And I disagreed with *that* was well. They should have simply introduced legendary headgear and moved forward.
---
Says built 1/1 for me.
---
Just a couple friends.  I'm in cool, non-toxic Minnesota.
---
Well, mostly non-toxic.
---
Just happened to me on Xbox 1. 2 out of 3 tries on this event so far.
---
It depends on the quest, if it‚Äôs the one where you have to go find a weapon box or whatever you get a legendary weapon or armor. This could include plan weapons like the fixer, gauss mini or tenderizer
---
Okay - the "mechanical bits" in the armor is what the chassis is.
---
Not relevant. By that logic, duped B2525 Fixers outnumber legitimate ones, so why not delete all of them?
---
With the premise of the game and the other building sets we shouldn‚Äôt have even gotten a junk wall set in the first place
---
Yeah , each person can much 3 nukes per server , so if you have a team of 4 persons √ó 3 = 12 nukes
---
ADD A COLT .45 1911!!!!!!
---
Yep I do this when the sun glares on my screen.  üòé
---
Same here! But everywhere else I hear that the limit is 2/2?
---
We already can rotate camp objects, op wants them to be able to be mirrored/inverted
---
Ammo Factory or that lockpicking one. As a commando scavenger build, I find myself repeatedly switching between perks for ammo and loot, only to forget to swap back.
---
There‚Äôs 2 different smoke machines and unless anything has changed you can build 1 of each
---
Normal Xbox one, never had it crash but I have had extreme lag from meat piles and teslas
---
That‚Äôs cool
---
Extra intelligence or the radiation resistance one
---
Ohhh ok! Thank you so much! Where do you get the other one?
---
I meant a free form rotation on the y axis as well as the X axis!
---
So we can place things correctly on hills and slopes.
---
As well as the wall or ceiling positioning of objects too.
---
the Morgan Town Airport actually uses the TV assets upside down!
---
I have no idea, I've had mine awhile and it's always said that.
---
That‚Äôs why all my legendary perks except maybe 1 will be the special cards. That way I can have a jack-of-all trades and have strength-based builds viable on my commando character, as it‚Äôs getting worse and worse to have to have multiple characters.
---
Mines doing the same thing
---
1 ceiling glitch, 9 successes, no crashes, original ps4. Good network bandwidth due to needing it for work though, tends to be a big factor in stability on consoles
---
You can still build the scrap box, you just can‚Äôt put stuff in it anymore
---
Cant wait to see for myself if my junkies explosive combat shotty will be good out of vats. I have a magic AA 33vats shotty for vats and the je shotgun for out of vats. I keep 4 in gunsmith rn when using my daily vats AA sg, but thinking abt trying the je sg (and swap gunsmith for demo xpert) on invisible enemies in the new ops. Havent played the pts cuz im on ps4, but have switched my sg playstyle from stealth to 40% health, and can tank the supermutants and robots fine enough so yeah, def pumped for patch 22 i guess lol
---
This game has pissed me off so much today.
---
No way a BE could keep pace with that in the new system.
---
Have you tried going to A Colossal Problem? People usually drop like flies in there and it's usually an easy revive or 2 (especially if someone forgets about the mineshaft drop).
---
Contact someone who deals in consumers getting fucked outta their money.
---
They did pretty much scam you. Sold you something and you never got what you paid for. Dont pay for years worth of fallout 1st. Its pointless.
---
The bonus also increases caps earned and the like according to the wiki.
---
That doesn‚Äôt really count as ‚Äògriefing‚Äô in my opinion. You tried to help, they acted like a jerk, you chased them away.
---
I saw the thing on legendary pa core recharge replenishing his hp from robots, but then when he went to west tek got smashed instantly and i cracked up. However, he did get that new glitch to proc a few times. Not totally reliable it seems
---
Do you mean what‚Äôs on your wrist or when you bring it up to your face? The up close version has the quick boy view to make it faster.
---
Or you could by legendary models for when you start unlocking the crafted armor and weapons
---
its a known glitch.  you have to server hop several times or complete it on a private servrr to get it done.  Dont worry about getting the sample back.
---
Dust covers for the handmades auto receivers.
---
i know right? we already have the shroud costume.
---
Plot twist: she designed Fisto!!!
---
I totally understand u. A hint: use the pacifist mode (u can turn It on options). This way players can't kill you (and you can't kill them) and you can enjoy the game as you wish. 
---
In general, the community is adorable and soon you'll gonna make good friends ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Yeah, I think I'm going to roll with 4:2 or 5:1 legendary special perks for the same reason. I want base QoL perks without sacrificing optimization.
---
Wow, your comment was only said ten million other times in THIS post... we have more in common than you think :)
---
gain XP
---
They aren‚Äôt going to bother. Instanced base areas are coming. Eventually. Some day. Maybe never. But supposedly.
---
I got a pipe pistol yesterday from him, and it wasnt very good. I'm a lvl 89 so I wouldn't use it anyway.
---
I do that aswell. I dont feel bad about loosing 3 scrip
---
I live in the Ash Heap, probably one of the few who do. My camp is between Lewisburg and the Pylon Ambush Site. I get a surprising amount of foot traffic, and usually quite a few visitors after Encryptid.
---
I mostly get super mutants or robots. Occasionally up the road I might get blood eagles or mole miners. Ghouls in Lewisburg, mirelurks at Lake Reynolds. It's a nice variety.
---
Fwiw, the rep glitch for raiders still works. Maybe 15-20min to max. Agreed it's painfully slow legit, but at least it's faster than settler rep.
---
Do the side quests, and low level events. It'll happen faster than you think.
---
Sounds like send damage and autohotkey. I guess if you're trying to level up quick, but why do that on a public server?
---
I think its limb damage shotguns that are broken right now, I have no perks for them and when I have a limb damage shotgun I 1 shot most things
---
Thx and can you tell me how to start wastelanders or increase SCORE rank
---
Outside of the locations mentioned, tin, aluminum and full paint cans are a good scrap source of lead too. Honestly, I think those items are the real gold bullion of Appalachia...
---
Honestly I think it all boils down at how trash tge pvp system in this game is, the rules are really not clear at all and the strength difference between players make it a dumb experience, not considering the technical aspects of how terrible the engine is in that regard with dodgy hit boxes and out of synch situations.
---
Don't really see a point of PvP in a game like this that in the end, dying doesn't really mater at all.
---
No comment on NW, it is its own thing and for those that enjoy it, more power to them.
---
I did the math I'm gonna have about 842 coins.
---
I just went to a different fissure site and got it that way.
---
Alright, I'll try that. Thank you!
---
&gt;traumatic
---
Its a video game
---
I want a Crocollosus costume really, really bad.
---
If nothing else, another new Settler quest would be nice. Raiders at least have to 2 choose from, plus the River Adventures miniquests. All we get in Foundation is Ward bitching about "stolen" equipment.
---
You should look up the map of all the resource deposits, did wonders for me
---
No problem, hope it works for ya.
---
Talk to the two ladies right down the stairs from vault 76 and they have you go to the wayward. That‚Äôs the start
---
There are three silos. Each silo can launch one nuke at a time, and there‚Äôs a 2 or 3 hour cool-down period before a silo can launch another nuke. You must have a nuclear keycard (a keycard works for any silo) and the current numeric code for the specific silo you‚Äôre launching from. Each run through a silo has the same quest stages - you‚Äôll have to make a biometric ID again, etc. I‚Äôve never seen two nukes launch simultaneously, but I‚Äôve seen folks coordinate so they launch in pretty quick succession.
---
They said they would make some of those things available to buy for bullion in later seasons, so don't give up on the wallpaper yet!!
---
Oh , ya for sure.
---
I‚Äôve done that, I‚Äôm on the mission that makes you lvl up to 20
---
considering the fact that we literally had several "give NPCs a million of junk items!" questlines, yeah.
---
That explains a lot thanks
---
Oh! At some point in the main quest, you may have ended up with a Missile Silo State holotape. That will show you the current status of all of the silos including amount of cool down remaining.
---
They should just make it player specific for your own spawn point but everyone else goes wherever
---
I would enjoy some more flat land for sure. I desperately need more water sources tho around the map. I would love for us to have an event where we repair the Dam and we actually get that damn lake. I would love to step out of my camp to see 5 other players on different sides of it waving at me from their camps.
---
I‚Äôm good personally. Thanks, though!
---
Who has stash space to put weapons?
---
Yeah they instantly open when you're in the buying screen with the purveyor, they're not sold as crates that go to your inventory and unfortunately, because you're level 40, won't be Max level.
---
Oh yeah man, it drives me nuts ! But i'm even more excited about the fact that now i'll be able to work on my animated perk cards üòÖ
---
Yes I need that 20000 steel what are you talking about?
---
still just an interior commando
---
It's a Halloween themed machine so we just have to wait a couple months.
---
Take off the backpack problem solved
---
Damn it! Haha. I've been dying to buy halloween stuff buy I heard last year they didn't release it until almost halloween instead of the beginning of the month.
---
Shittily vote this up.
---
Damnnn so lemme ask this then...this guy we ran with..not a friend just a random, level 400+, had a squad I‚Äôm guessing and they literally melted the SBQ AND earl in under 15 seconds...the same kid after finishing one SBQ, launched a nuke about 30 seconds after event completion (he was with us the entire time fighting the Queen)...would that be a modder? I mean I know they‚Äôre high levels but completing those events so fast has to be a bit fishy. Again no complaints on the guy really he wasn‚Äôt being an ass to us I‚Äôm just curious as I‚Äôm new to the game
---
Not mine. I'll get a quest every day at a random time each day for a week or two then...nothing for a month. Makes no sense.
---
I thi k this happened to me a year ago I think you have to pick up so much junk then it respawns.
---
I lol'd, then I cried.
---
It did!! Thanks, again!
---
I‚Äôm doing 39 with a Gatling plasma
---
Events, Quests, and just killing pixels ... other suggestions are to team up and use Inspirational (Charisma) perk card.
---
The XP will come ... just enjoy playing and exploring the game
---
üëç
---
How about a deathclaw costume to go with the mask from fascnat? Or even better a power armor paint so you're closer in size to one lol
---
Glitched how? Do they just stand in 1 place? If you're using the future tec C.A.M.P skin from the legendary run, thats your culprit, remove the skin, then replace and rebuild your base, allies should work as normal.
---
Glitched how? Have you tried scrapping the Ally item and rebuilding it?
---
This or at least give workshops the ability to clear trash. I hate capping the lakeside cabins and I can‚Äôt even use the house cause it has permanent trash everywhere
---
I could be wrong, but from what I have read is.this.
---
Perks are additive,  not a multiplier.   So instead of XŸ™ damage it is plus X.  10Ÿ™ becomes plus 10
---
You and I are in the Forrest.   I'm lvl 38, you are lvl 500.. we see two different creatures.   That SM to me could be lvl 5, but maxed lvl for you. 
---
Perk cards can be scrapped for 2 perk coins.  That is per rank of the scrapped card.
---
Hope it helps.
---
Yup, only twice tho.
---
Do the responders quests in Flatwoods, then Morgantown to gain xp.
---
If you rush into Wastelanders quests at lv 20 you might find them too difficult.
---
If you're using the gift box to drop loot, surprisingly there are a number of item which can be built on top of it, and they remain in place after the gift box is removed. Combined with the rug trick you can create quite a variety of floating items.
---
Edit: misread what you meant by floating oops.  Have you tried blueprinting the single item then placing the blueprint?  Sometimes this works to place things where the outline is green but unplaceable.
---
Energy damage penetration formula is messed up, so energy weapons will almost always deal puny damage. Earle has 400 ER, so you'll never punch through.
---
That is pretty decent, despite the bug.
---
If you get lucky enough to roll either one of those I don‚Äôt think your preference is going to matter
---
Wait you got a furious????
---
Next season starts on Tuesday the 15th. There is no active legendary run and you cannot increase your SCORE because of that.
---
We are in a one week break for seasons. Season 2 starts on the 15th, new challenges will be available then. Currently there is no score available
---
The season is over the new one comes Tuesday
---
What sirman_sh just said.get on a team.i would do building team you get more xp per each person that's on it or a event team that's doing events just join and shoot the bad guys.dont have to kill them just get a shot in and let your teammates finish them off...I did scorched earth at level 15 just so I could get some xp.i would shoot a few things guys around me would finish them off.gained 2 levels in 15 mins
---
*you are over encumbered and cannot run*

---
Instead of switching walls just put a weapon display rack over the door. It would kinda look like the shop is boarded up
---
Someone tag that Bethesda community lady!
---
On the wrist because it really ruins role play you have to come up with some stupid story on how your character got it when lore reality it is basically impossible
---
I bought alot of armor and right now I have a full vanguard set and unyielding set as well..level 24 not sure what direction I'm going but I knew I would outgrow the weapons...after tomorrow morning the sell will be over so take advantage of 50%off I know nobody wants a level 40 weapon but at half off.... that a better chance at getting something you could use
---
Drink Brahmin milk
---
Looking forward to the new dupe that was found on PTS but not reported.
---
Took a bit of searching but I finally found it. That's a really good place for a camp and not too far from mine even, yet I never knew that bridge was there.
---
What this dude said is def tru.that nice looking orange camp-o-mabob change it back to the green one and it will get it fixed
---
National Guard laying sandbags in prep.
---
Ooh, no i haven't but that sounds like a plan. Something i need to try. Does it also work for areas that give me green but says that its overlapping an existing piece?
---
Play the game
---
More people want skins for the weapons worth using.
---
He yes, but not his close ones and not the Council of Elders. I think thats why the next updated is called Fractured Steel.
---
Oh thank you so much I woulda never known
---
Why give it to us with the junk walls when they can charge 500 atoms for the gate alone?
---
LoL.The Fixer is pretty popular yet its riding along with the neglected weapons as far as skins...kinda lazy being that everything the combat rifle uses works on a fixer...why not the skins?
---
It‚Äôs near essential as a rifleman, otherwise you get mobbed since your fire rate is so low.  With a decent agility (I‚Äôm currently 13) and one chameleon piece of armor, I can sneak attack most stuff.  Like I said, with that build, you can 1-shot most enemies, but you should keep a combat rifle or handmade (with a semi-auto receiver to benefit from rifleman perks) as your backup weapon in case you‚Äôre discovered and need to blast yourself out.
---
I struggled in boss fights with that build, but could pretty much handle myself anywhere else
---
Without drug, a Bloodied Laser Gatling can pull around 20 per shot once you are at 20% health...and have all the perks needed.
---
The Gatling Plasma you can easily go above 50-75...sometime 100 depending on the buffs.
---
And both can probably go even higher if they are explosive.
---
The Minigun idk..i never play with it.
---
Exactly! Refreshing to hear someone say that lol
---
So, remove the ability for friends that want to play on the same team to be able to do so?
---
No, I disagree.
---
It's not letting me add ya on discord.
---
I'm not the type to bash coders or dev's but in this case it's just  laziness or neglect .idk learn a mod for combat rifle it works on my fixer...skins üëé
---
How many ppl just started playing? This is like the 20th post about them starting and wondering why they can‚Äôt move forward. Last week it was post about ppl not realizing it was ending and not buying the last pieces they needed. But don‚Äôt worry, Tuesday we get a whole new board and new stuff. Plus this board looks better then the first season and you can buy certain stuff from season 1 pass.
---
You'll have to give it a try for various scenarios, I don't recall all the cases off the top of my head.
---
I use a .50 hunting rifle with Ghillie suit and Ghillie camo skin for the gun, that's excellent,  more good combos like this
---
Legendary perk slots unlock at 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 &amp; 300
---
I'm talking about those large signs already printed that people are putting on their machines.
---
Serendipity. Blocker. Full uny armour is a must. Sentinel or cavalier if u can get it. Personally don‚Äôt run dodgy as I prefer 5 in adrenaline. Stealth is your friend. With fully Uny and 15 in perception without the stealth card or any stealth armour I‚Äôm invisible. Nerd rage/adrenal reaction/covert op/ all stack for massive damage per shot. And blocker helps mitigate melee attacks and serendipity with ranged.
---
One of my in-game friends was complaining about that and saying he was gonna boycott the game. It was all I could do to not tell him he's being a little whiney bitch lol
---
Bloodied and Junkie's will still be the best. Basically the nerf is going to leave everything in exactly the same spot except enemies will be *slightly* harder to kill. If people are really that upset because they can no longer one shot Scorchbeasts and endgame enemies then they need to go play something else.
---
Most importantly, you'll make new gaming buddies along the way! ;)
---
I stopped b/c some idiot at 22 with Chameleon was using explosives on my CAMP. I looked at him/her for a few seconds and then logged out. Morons.
---
I know how that pay to play aspect goes.!.! But damn I keep paying!
---
I found that.
---
My bloodied is almost 30 I think. Tonight I was head dinking him for 300 with my bloodied fixer. But I can get magic damage with my bloodied gat laser. So when I want to get him down quick I use that. But I think it‚Äôs like 14 to 15 until perks start procing. I use no perk cards for heavy gunner tho
---
One of the raider dailies can pay out settler reputation as well!
---
Yeah, a 1* and one with bashing damage and faster movement speed while aiming.
---
That's too bad. As a newer player I was really excited about the Gauss Pistol and since unlocking it I've come across a few neat legendaries, one of which was entirely vats focused. Guess my ts plasma gat will just keep on truckin'.
---
don't understand why the 10mm and smg aren't skinned then.
---
.. fast travel working reliably... ...speed demon working after fast travel... ...fast travel destination mats for camps removed after Beta...  (X) RESPAWN lock up at event end...  I think we all know the lists
---
Ya.good ideas. üëè
---
&gt; Ikr, Just take it slow though &amp; really consider what you‚Äôre scrapping.
---
I'm going a different route;  I'm going to burn through my cards with a vengeance.
---
..... But leave 30-40 levels unspent to buy back any oops later on.
---
Theres a few glitches out there that let you skip most of the silo and jump right into the prep room, so a  silo takes less than 10 minutes or so prep to launch.
---
Chances are he cleared the silo prior, and just fast traveled back to launch another nuke once the queen was dead. 
---
Seen it mamy times a few people get together, clear all 3 silos and drop 3 back to back nukes.
---
They all change. Like wander I use to get weapons for the first 3 then I got nothing but rescue missions. I switch them after I have a couple of those or kill missions. Last 3 for becket have been weapons tho. First two where melee and last night I got a 3 star bloodied plasma caster. So sometimes it seems like you get same stuff but it does vary
---
I've dropped hundreds of pounds of stuff that I haven't had time to move onto mules. It's such a time consuming process.
---
As it is now semi-auto weapons are hurting. But the nerf isn't going to damage them that much. I've seen both sides of the PTS, those who are acting like it's the end of the world, and then the people that understand it's not that big of a difference. There will still be plenty of ways to stack and hit crazy damage, even as a sneak sniper build. Might take a couple extra shots, but so what?
---
That said, if you aren't enjoy the game or any game for that matter, play something else for sure. I usually come and go from the game, enjoy it when I do, play something else when I don't.
---
Which one, the mirelurk defend or what? I read that was a thing, but it wasn't working for me.
---
Would require a server hop.
---
3 nukes per server. Once launched theres a couple hourncool down. Cool down is tied to server silo not player. So once you lauch from all 3 silos, server hop and do it all over again.
---
&gt; Yea but is it something you can do before it after 50? Ive read something like that but not sure.
---
It's impossible to do before 50 - because logically it makes no sense.
---
After 50 - it costs a "level up" to move a perk point.
---
Prior to level 50, a level "gives" you a perk point.  Nothing to lose.
---
I thought it was Earl without the E? Do I just not read
---
Just sell them to a robot vendor.
---
Sweet, ty
---
Oh, it's not being cynical.  We KNOW people are going to come to reddit to cry about it.  No matter what happens.
---
First time I've seen this mentioned personally, but that's a great idea! 
---
As of now I'm mostly sitting on a ton of cursed weapons so I can hoard scrip without too much of a weight issue.
---
Perk loadouts are not a respec. And the respec we have is this clunky slow thing that just hurts you in that awkward inbetween phase unless you spend multiple levelups doing nothing.
---
Camp is safe offline. It only spawns in when you log in. 
---
When you die, only scrap is dropped. 
---
If you have Xbox games pass, it‚Äôs on there to download free with membership. That‚Äôs what I did. I‚Äôve been playing it for about 3 weeks or so.
---
This is impossible, for my legs are broke
---
While the duping was definitely a glitch, the stacking wasn't. The devs didn't expect players to get their hands on so many of them, so they didn't think they needed to limit the buff stacking from magazines and bobbleheads.
---
Wait, season 2 begins this week? I'm lost, haven't played the game in a while
---
But grenades are still marked as equipped in the inventory screen
---
It's been fixed for a month after it was broken for a month.
---
Considering how crazy some of the melee weapons are, duel pistols fits right in.
---
Not really, the most stuff People complained about i never saw. Atleast for me.
---
No one can loot your stash. They can loot from your collectors like water purifiers and crops. You can lock containers like the purifiers, but players can pick the lock if they have the required perks. This however flags then as ‚ÄòWanted‚Äô. 
---
When you aren‚Äôt logged in, your camp isn‚Äôt there. 
---
If you die, you lose some caps equal to your level (up to 50) and any junk/scrap you were carrying. So stash your junk/scrap often.
---
Other players cannot attack your unless you are flagged for PvP. You only get flagged for PvP is you have Pacifist turned off at level 5+, you claim or contest a workshop, or you pick a player owned container and get the ‚ÄòWanted‚Äô tag.
---
Two shot explosive has somehow come out of it almost unscathed, the perks and weapon mods are still nerfed but those legendary effects still work as before. Shame they were already nerfed ages ago.
---
Your camp is not present when you are not logged in and is relatively safe when you are logged in.  For the most part this is just a fallout game where real humans play some of the NPCs.  Most everyone in the community is helpful and there are very few of the problems you see with other MMOs.  At this very moment the actual story is a bit thin and the end game doesn't have much to it.  But as far as concerns about being victimized MMO style I would say that those are pretty much not an issue.
---
Yes, please.  Something like 30% of the land in the map is unusable because of all the elevation changes.  Either that or clean up the building code a bit to allow us to build better structures that can handle uneven ground/obstacles.  It's extremely hard to build in the Mire...but I guess that could be by design.
---
I forgot about that one. If you've already maxed Crater rep, does it go back down when you pick that option?
---
Thank you, that sounds very, very tempting
---
Just that Maxon is the only Elder who truley had succes.  
---
And no, the Paladin that is coming over has the same views as Maxon and is has different views then what you see years later at the West Coast.
---
good luck. one of my magazines is bugged so i cant complete the challenge.
---
It doesn't go down regardless, crater doesn't need to know what happened to the guy, just that they aren't a problem for them anymore, so you can gain rep form both at once!
---
Just explore the world.  Taking the little things the little details that Bethesda actually gets right. Do some side quests gather materials build a small camp.  Once you get to level 20 the quest opens up to you but that doesn't mean you're of a level where you can complete it.  You still have a lot of leveling to do before you can finish the  main quest
---
Isn‚Äôt that the point?
---
"" 
---
when my stupid job allows it.""  
---
I feel you dude. I know what you mean.
---
I mean, don't worry THAT much, bust out a few levels and cherry pick what you missed
---
1. No one can loot your camp items. Although there was awhile back a vendor/stash hack to steal your stuff but thats supposedly been resolved. 
---
2. When you log off so does your camp. 
---
3. Junk is the only thing they can loot off you, actually not sure if they can loot what you're wearing, like armor, if somebody can answer that lol.
---
I think some more nocturnal harpoon guns will fix your legs
---
Use a grenade.
---
Sorry, I didn‚Äôt see the post about it but thx for letting me know
---
i want 2 perks but i will work on maxing out one first.
---
first one i will max out is the rad perk which removes rads. this will be better than my sunkissed perk.
---
second one will be the lockpick perk. i could jsut keep this at rank 1 but i will probably level it up if i dont see anything else that i want i at the time.
---
probably grab some of the PA legendary perks because i use it in nuke zones.
---
It's unlimited junk storage your still quite fucked on ammo weapons and other stuff
---
This is correct. Doesn't really matter what you get from the sale as the 50% off sale is so ridiculous you can get 80% of your cost back by scripping it. Hell I've been rolling level 1 armor on my alts just for kicks. Buy 5 pieces of armor for 150 scrip and scrip them for 120 back. As long as you've got time to flip them it's worth it. I've got 4 alts that I don't actively play so they'll just be sitting at the Purveyor for the next few weeks scripping back down to traveling weight.
---
I know you're just joking, but there's a vendor bot in the fire station north of the Rusty Pick. Even the most over encumbered visitor to Grandma can get there real quick.
---
Wasn't me. I just answered your question and left.
---
I always got the quest complete dialogue option for that one, but if I clicked through the "why are you here" bit then it usually let me ask if there was any work and start that way. Janky as hell, though.
---
As far as what I was thinking of, I'm pretty sure the sub rules ban explaining it. Hell, it might hace technically been against the rules to mention it.
---
Symptom of the disease really. It's because we really all know Beth is gonna shit the bed somehow.
---
Just thats it not worthless. The nerf was needed. A Game where you can kill Bosses in seconds is dumb.  If you find this acceptable then there is something wrong with you.
---
Thanks everyone ! Got a bloodied 25% fire rate Gatling plasma to try
---
Really? I could have sworn it did. Thanks for the info!
---
That would make me very happy indeed, 800 for a hoarder like me just isn't enough I love having massive stocks of junk, plus junk is a big part of my vendor income. And my camp is maxed and it's not even that much stuff at least it doesn't look like I should be maxed to me so I'd love an increase to make my house look better without sacrificing something lol
---
lol, love the typo in the title. I can help you bud, add me ingame, username is the same as here. DM your username so I can add you too
---
I've got 1700 hours into the game, been playing since launch. I've claimed thousands of workshops on public servers.
---
I've been attacked in a workshop less than 5 times.
---
It's pretty simple to avoid being attacked...
---
1. Stay crouched when in a workshop so your dot doesn't show on the map.
---
2. Don't hang out in the workshop when you don't need to be there.
---
3. Don't meet people for trades in workshops. Ever.
---
4. Don't go into a workshop with pacifist on unless you plan to die if you get into pvp. Also know that pacifist offers you no protection. It's only there to prevent you from triggering pvp outside of workshop areas.
---
5. Unless you're planning to claim or contest a workshop don't walk through it. Joining defend events is safe, but leave right after because anyone there who isn't the owner can start a contest after the event ends and that means they can kill you.
---
6. If someone else shows up for your workshop defend event once you're there just leave the workshop boundary a few seconds before the event ends (you're protected during the event) if they seem like they're not planning on leaving. If you're out of bounds it won't flag you hostile if they contest the workshop. If they were only there to grief they will likely just leave if they can't kill you and then you can reclaim it.
---
Most people just have no idea how pvp rules work so they make themselves easy prey.
---
I will admit that title gave me a chuckle. But on a serious note I completely understand your pain. My stash is constantly full of legendaries and I have to wait day-to-day to unload them all.
---
Always do this, the animation of getting the pipboy out is very laggy and a big hinderence in an online game!
---
Yes, do a search on AngryTurtle's videos about magic shotguns. Some legendary effects like limb damage inflict crazy damage with shotguns in VATS, or high fire rate guns.
---
Bloodied is fine, weaker but fine, everyone is getting nerfed!
---
Holy holy!  That‚Äôs autocorrect for you!
---
You can, but realize there aren't unlimited server instances to hop to.
---
Radiation resistance is getting maxed out day I. Goodbye power armour
---
If you‚Äôll looking for the fallout 3, 4 and NV it has a mixed feeling with online play. If you‚Äôre not in to PvP the game is playable as solo or with groups. If you don‚Äôt want to.. you can never engage in PvP. You can join group events and boss fights. New update on the 15th will add a better dungeon aspect to the game.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox give it a shot (free with game pass). Like any Bethesda game there will be bugs. As you see people complain about them but I find them manageable. I think you can pick up a used copy for a decent price. 
---
This game has a phenomenal community and is extremely helpful on reddit and in the general game. Griefers are very uncommon. Take all negative comments about the game with a grain of salt and try it for yourself.  I‚Äôve played all the fallout games! So I think you would enjoy it.
---
And for a third one do the photo daily!
---
Make a blueprint with all the requirements for every score building challenge, it makes it a lot quicker to get it and get out of there.
---
My flamer was doing 42/24 a day ago, not bloodied, just +10% while aiming. Really need to get some explosive weapons.
---
Oh, oof!
---
No. 
---
The 3 silos on a server will always have a server cooldown after someone launches. 3 hours. But players who launch also get a personal cooldown of around 2 hours. So that means you can launch 3 nukes in a fresh server, but you can't server hop and keep launching because of your personal cooldown. Once a nuke has been launched on a server, the silo is locked down until the cooldown ends.
---
Little House in the Wasteland.... I would watch It
---
You have a personal cooldown too, server hopping does not negate this.
---
Also, added you, ign creamyzombie
---
Is the map also expanding at all? I ran around quite a bit of the edges today and was shocked to see the boundaries so far in vs what the map shows.
---
One thing I loved about FO4 was randomly wandering the edges and finding random stuff.
---
Y'all anti hoarding peeps really need to look at the world like you'd have to be crazy to leave resources in the goddam post apocalypse
---
Yep, bunch of stuff coming On the 15th unless they delay it. The latest inside the vault covered the new ops game mode.
---
Welcome to PC
---
Find the bad rolls and drop them in the Rusty Pick. Someone out there can use it!? I was hoarding... realized it will take forever to script them. Or mule?
---
But yes increase the limit on scripting and how much script one can hold!
---
Yeah and worst of all it almost never actually told you that someone was trying to claim it before the person was shooting at you.
---
Is that only a PC thing? Ps4 here, Cause I was trying for a good 10 minutes doing what other people said and he never popped the "need any help" option again.  
---
Been trying to get rep from the random encounters instead, but it is draining my caps slowly, and that's not kosher.
---
Up to a certain max percentage
---
You know I didn't know I wanted that until now and a skin for the grognak axe or super sledge to turn it into a sword that would be worth money to me.
---
added you too, are you online? Think my friends list is bugged out lol
---
They‚Äôd probably just put a limit on how many vouchers you can get per day too, unfortunately.
---
No.she kills rey because he is old.plus 1000 caps.lol.
---
Yes. Fuck yes.
---
Alternatively, lower the goddam radius around pre existing locations as they're stupidly big and there's land closer in that would be amazing. I'd love to build against Foundations walls, or in amongst Flatwoods township. So many ideas but we get relegated to bumfuck nowhere amongst the crags and BS.
---
the .45 pistol could work , i would see it as something stronger than the 10mm pistol with a small mag capacity
---
Awesome. I appreciate it.
---
Your camp only exists in the gameworld when you are online, so when you leave the server, your camp disappears. When you go online again, it is put down in the same place (if nobody else has taken that same spot in that server). Even when you are online, nobody can steal anything from your camp (except for some resource collection objects, which you can lock). When you die, you leave a lootbag containing only your junk items. Most of the time you can reclaim those, sometimes another player loots it. You won't lose any of your equipment or weapons.
---
After the singleplayer games the biggest change for me was that here the game never pauses (for example you can be attacked while you are browsing the pip-boy menus), and that you cannot save the game manually. Other than that, it is quite similar to earlier Fallout games. And it can be a great fun to play with other players.
---
This, right here. Favorited cards go to the front of the line instead of being alphabetised, unused cards go into a hidden "deck".
---
I'd suggest training wheels and make sure dad is close by.
---
Im speaking from my own first bike experience.
---
True.  Traumatic is not quite the right word, but it gets the point across..
---
  I don‚Äôt play them to have another person unleash a string of expletives and explicit descriptive adjectives b/c I‚Äôm a weak, new to the game player.
---
nerfing pistols seems so pointless and cruel , as they are already kinda suck
---
Where else are we supposed to take workshops? It‚Äôs not like everyone wants to dump their cash on something that‚Äôs proven time and time again to not deliver what has been promised.
---
Actually i would say that all weapons are worth selling to players because almost everyone will pay the base value of a weapon if hey are low on script because they cant play for long each day. I sell prob 20 weapons a day for a few thousand caps. Plus it encourages people to come look at your weapons if you have a decent amount verus a few.
---
I remember back in the beta I thought I had found someones stash and grabbed a few nice looking things. I was robbing myself. Every container that can hold items just connects back to your own stash - even in other peoples bases. There's not really a whole lot people can do to steal from you, other than taking water out your water purifiers or something and if that worries you you can just put a lock on it.
---
Definitely needed; especially with One Wasteland or whatever coming soon. Low DPS weapons are going to be useless across the board. 
---
The only time I ever really use a pistol is to kill level &lt;15s.
---
1 steel and 10k steel take the exact same effort to track as it is just "steel=x".  The issue is having multiples of items that are tracked individually such as degradable aid items, armor or weapons.  Each pump action shotgun is tracked separately.  That takes more effort.
---
They didn‚Äôt specify about a machine that‚Äôs all
---
It‚Äôs gonna be fun doing every daily and weekly because this season is AMAZING. Plus One Wasteland will fix oodles of issues.
---
Just junk, and also 50 caps if you're killed in pvp,
---
Honestly I can only think of one time ive had that issue but besides that I don't think anyone has tried to initiate PvP in a workshop with me
---
Can‚Äôt forget the he helmet and safety gear too!
---
do You have a link of them talking about how that‚Äôs coming in this patch I can‚Äôt find any info on anything really
---
Do they come in Plus-size extra¬†large? üòÇ
---
The image in my head of a man in tears paralyzed by the weight of his backpack while Mama Murmgh just stands in silence is hilarious.
---
*exterminator
---
Maybe u should get friends and become team...just saying
---
Exploding Palm,  and Master Infiltrator on my Str build. Maybe Hack and Slash. 
---
Ammo Factory and Master Infiltrator on my Heavy. 
---
Follow Through and Master Infiltrator on my Pistol/Sniper. 
---
After those, I haven‚Äôt really considered it. I know those are what I want first, but will wait before sinking other cards into their slots.
---
Are they doing anything with perk points?  I have 80+.
---
I'm on xbox and was thinking about this as well. I'm gonna hold off until the load out to start scrapping. Thanks for helping me make up my mind!
---
The reward is totally random (one time I got a 3 star gauss minigun from him for example).
---
Isnt woodchucker only one star? So if you had three it meant four perk coins were lost forever :(
---
&gt; for no reason other than forcing daily log ins for their reporting
---
If I wasn't quite sure that you have no idea what you were talking about before, this is the proof I needed. It must be nice in whatever world you're living in
---
I know which signs you‚Äôre referring to, I have them myself, but I can‚Äôt for the life of me remember which set they came from. It was an ATX bundle, I think a settler pack of some form?
---
Phew, that's a relief. But why do players stand naked begging to be killed when they're wanted? I always assumed it was because they didn't want their armor taken.
---
I don‚Äôt think pistols should deal higher damage than rifles and heavy weapons. (Though I also don‚Äôt think explosions should only tickle you)
---
Pistols should have other base buffs like,  movement speed increase, increase stealth, reduced ap cost while sprinting, ability to dual wield maybe by a perk with less recoil control and accuracy. 
---
There are certain pistol like .44 that should be as good as sniper rifles at closer range.
---
I am honestly tickled that you like the event just simply because you enjoy doing it.  Bravo.
---
That was kind of your friends, welcome back!!
---
Junkyard bundle pack exclusive. Had the junk walls, junkyard PA skin, spiked barricades, couple others.
---
welcome to capitalism
---
I've always hated building resource CAMPs cause the locations are rarely pretty, and when they are they're already taken. And that's all *if* the resource is something I need, like lead, acid, or oil.
---
My current CAMP is just south of Monongah Mine, which gives me a convenient location for travel, I'm close to several locations to farm resources from ads, it's a great staging location for Earle, and I have a great view of Atlas and the surrounding valley range. Also if I load in to a nuke zone and choose a new world, the flora around me stays fluxed so I get free flux pretty regularly.
---
Saaaaame
---
Honestly I'm kind of in the opposite train - I'm glad we can finally stack perk cards beyond the amount required for a set of everything. I have opened so many packs on my level 360+ main and have gotten at least 15 copies of butcher's bounty. I have a full set of animated ones, rank 1-3, and still got more copies just from opening packs that vanished into the void. I lost out on so many potential perk coins due to that. Players leveling up after this update won't have to go through this, thankfully
---
I‚Äôve wanted perk loadouts since launch and suggested a system to swap unused cards for new random ones like a year ago. This is gonna be awesome tho
---
She doesn‚Äôt stand in silence, she laughs in horrific perversion while tossing lead pipes and tire irons on top of the pile
---
Not even duplicate, just let us get rid of them in general. A keyring won't really help with server stability, only outright getting rid of them. I don't care about opening some random safe or terminal for a quest I did 200 levels ago, I just don't want it taking up space anymore
---
Yuuuup same here especially if I don't have a lot of time that day. It's a relatively quick way to empty out the vendor caps
---
[Instructions were unclear](https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2019/03/bike_crash-1468595091943-1jedfc1vp3hut-1000-100-5a5ea67.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=960%2C539)
---
I can shrug off anything broken in the open world. But if it‚Äôs something on my character or my home, I‚Äôll be pretty pissed.
---
How much of that will be from having to spam picking out action boy over and over with unspent perk points (not to be confused with perk coins)
---
Thank you dude!! :D Im so happy dude you don't understand.
---
Well dang
---
Well i know about legendary perks but i mean just regular perks
---
Arnt we all
---
Many animations in this game can be canceled. As others said, jumping or switching to third person also gets rid of that fall "stagger" in PA. A potentially more useful one is that firing a gun will skip putting a stimpak away after you use it. And once you fire a gun, you can spam another stimpak immediately without the second or so cooldown that's normally there outside PA. This can be done in an infinite cycle as long as your health is not full, and this lets you both heal faster than normally possible and potentially shoot your gun faster than normally possible (if you're using a hunting rifle, this skips cycling the bolt)
---
sleep in your bed for \~30 seconds (5% XP boost), join a public building team (INT boosts xp gain), inspirational perk card if u have it (gives another 5/10/15% xp boost), and maybe if ur up for it find some cranberries to make cranberry cobbler for another 5% xp boost. do some daily quests/side quests and events (the ones at the giant teapot are super easy, so are workshop defenses) and you'll get there quickly enough!
---
... holy moly is what I meant there.  Gotta work on my proofreading skills.
---
I eh just do workshops in the private server so i dont run into issues. Like i have bad luck with adventure mode so i leave that to vending or questing. Tbh. Me and my gf traipse the wastes together and i bounce to and fro collecting junk.
---
To tag onto this, you can farm these weapons and their ammo at Morgantown Airport.  Scrap the weapons to learn their mods and get all Scrooge McDuck rolling in all that ammo.
---
totally ignoring your questions cuz these other fine chaps got to them; the game is certainly worth it! You'll have a blast and get sucked in easily no doubt, esp. as a fan of the series
---
Oh ya. I didn‚Äôt think about weapons.
---
Getting them in the originally intended way is extremely rare. As in, so rare that at this time last year there was still debate as to whether they existed. But then they were put into the drop pool for holiday gifts, and millions upon millions of those gifts got duped to the point where people were dropping dozens of plasma grenade plans at train stations. So getting a new, legit plan is extremely rare. Just finding one in general is not
---
That's a brilliant idea. Never thought about it. But that'd be perfect. Most of my stash is legendary weapons. Can't get rid of them fast enough.
---
Not really. Hard to get normally but they've been duped into oblivion.
---
A player came up from behind me in a stealth boy.i was level 23.he was level 346.he killed me.took my 1 piece of steel and 2 plastic.then ate my body for sustenance.just a straight up dickhead.if you are going to go around doing pvp,at least fight players your own level.that know the mechanics of the game.otherwise you like an asshole.tbh.there should be a gladiator style arena where we can take our builds and put them to the test in pvp.have rewards.hell even bets on who would win.wait wasn't there a place like this in new vegas?i thik it was under freeside?not sure.
---
Quality ass post, surprised folks haven't jumped on this- the circus cart is hella expensive in my experience
---
Jesus man I gotta be honest...trying to understand this while heavily intoxicated is probably harder than learning Rosetta Stone Chinese lmao. I think I got it though I understand enough
---
All you need is a large hill and empty streets. You‚Äôll be fine
---
Ok cool i remember when you had an acheivment for crafting them and that was just mean from bethesda
---
Taking the first rank of a legendary perk is free, and master infiltrator replaces all the hacker/lockpicking perks right off the bat. Upgrading that perk only lets you auto-hack/lockpick rank 1, 2, and 3 terminals/locks. I still would consider that you have a maximum of 6 legendary perk slots, which can include raising your SPECIAL, and that by itself may be worth far more than not having to switch a few utility cards back and forth for you
---
Really? I‚Äôm relatively new and I get so many plasma nades off corpses I have over 20 in my inventory atm. They‚Äôre the only nades I use, granted I don‚Äôt use nades very often in general. Only in the ‚ÄúOH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT‚Äù moments
---
Sweet!! Very excited to join the community honestly.
---
Yep. And based on how the armor formula works, you're hardly getting noticeable benefit at that point. Not to mention many melee weapons have a mod that increases armor penetration anyway
---
Hey I just bought 20k steel today, and paid for fo1 to hold it. The ammo grind is real
---
The plan not the nade itself
---
After your run, fast travel to Summerville. The first house on the left has over 250+ burnt books and only takes about 5 minutes to grab them all. Hop server, and all your lead spots should be back.
---
So all 238 fasnacht masks in my stash are a problem?
---
Yeah i get what you mean they are mainly used in the "Oh fuck im out of ammo my melee broke and im about to die, YEET TIME!!!" moments
---
Not rare at all. The xmas presents got duped to hell and back, so lots of those plasma grenade plans are everywhere now.
---
1500 script limit a week would be a better improvement.. 150 script a day is a joke.
---
Ha ha
---
Yes and if you cut down on them you should see faster loading times.
---
They were worthless even before duped gifts, people duped nukas colas and used macros to spam them in front of vendors. Now they are just further down the pit of worthlessness
---
Wow oof any idea why my speed demon serum dissapered from my stash box?
---
\*mumble\* clickbait title \*mumble\* reporting to mods \*mumble\*
---
Ive been spendin 1000 scrip for this event on trash revolvers and pipe weapons and fatmans. The purveyor really hurtin now more than ever fr and I think you right about the system needin a rework. I havent gotten somethin good in 3 months of active playin üò≠
---
I buy a lot of things with caps lol then I trade up for better things caps can‚Äôt buy.. def not worthless, gotta know the market
---
Its really going to be bad if they nerf damage for all builds..
---
Yeah, the plans sold only for top-tier legendaries or (if you were extremely lucky) 30k caps. Within a week of the present duping, they were being dropped off for free or sold for 50-100 caps. But that scout challenge for crafting 3 plasma grenades was a unicorn for a long time
---
Sure.  What's your ID? What do you need me to do?  I have lunch boxes and canned meat stew to help, as well.
---
All those bloodied builds who went for bloodied builds *because* they were stupid OP and are now complaining that it's been nerfed?
---
I have no sympathy.
---
The grenades are common, the plans can only be found as an obnoxiously rare drop from a few specific explosive containers and I think from an ash heap event
---
A buff after a nerf! A buffnerfity
---
That doesn't work sadly
---
I don‚Äôt think they are getting hit harder than other weapons. Legacies will still be op.
---
Please balance the game around me. 
---
Hello I just got a legacy weapon that isn‚Äôt sposed to be in the game anymore. But instead of removing it the devs are making it do less damage! This cannot be; please only let one build be viable and make sure it‚Äôs mine.
---
Master Infiltrator is a boon for those on console or have installed PLM on PC. Not even the full autolock, just rank one is plenty as it is.
---
I'm on PC with PLM and even I'm considering it since it saves so much time and hassle switching between the two all the time.
---
I mean you can just do the same glitch and paint both sides, but some wallpapers probably look silly as external walls
---
Plus it'll eat up your budget
---
Proceeds to toss several bikes off of Seneca rocks
---
Sent you a PM friend
---
Good question, thanks!
---
Ahhhhhhh I see, yeah I think I‚Äôve only seen the plans from a player vendor but tbh, finding the plans I need in general seem damn near impossible in this game, I.e. THE GODDAMN HEAVY BARREL FOR THE .50 CAL MACHINE GUN
---
I put a lot of time into my build, pardon me if I don‚Äôt want it to be nerfed and be useless! Not everything needs to be nerfed! It‚Äôs because of the cry babies that they are needing everything
---
Didn‚Äôt you know that nukes were powered by bikes?
---
The interloper at lucky hole mine, it‚Äôs cousin at the deep, and their associated statues at Tanagra town/watoga/etc are a fun one
---
The al√≠en guidestones will prolly be relevant later in 76‚Äôs story 
---
Someone was talking about the sugar grove black site and some special key hidden in a tree-accessible roof somewhere
---
What does useless mean to you, big boy? Have you played PTS? You‚Äôll prolly still be killing things pretty damn ez
---
You are entering the wasteland levels - mid 20s to late 30s will be weirdly more tiresome and grindy that the levels before and after.   But the legendary run starts next week, which should help with leveling.
---
At level 20, I would suggest farming the prison yard for super mutants - you'll get a few caps as well as a ton of weapons to sell or scrap for parts.  There's some lead via the weights in the yard occasionally as well.  
---
Until you are powerful enough to farm mole men at black water mines or the eventual west tek farming, running events that you can fast travel to for free will help build up supplies and caps, and running through morgantown airport scorched will help with getting weapons to sell.  That airport has a section by the event that spawns there that can spawn quite a few stimpaks too (have the perk card that may increase your chance at finding additional med on too).  Try not to buy them - it's a waste of money.
---
Also - if you are in the forest area, go by camps that are owned by high levels - they will sometimes sell cheap or give things to lower level players.  I usually leave a bunch of supplies on a table outside my camp at the wayward.
---
Just don't give up - it gets better.  They ate just weird levels - very grindy and slow.
---
They need to buff pistols and the assault rifles..
---
Its been fixer and handmade.. Thats all you see..
---
Of course heavy weapons are also all you see.
---
Railway rifles and broadsiders also need help.. üòÖ..
---
You think they would listen..
---
If you're wanted you can't see other players or their camps (I think?) and they probably want to clear their bounty for that reason. No armor means a quicker death, or maybe that's just what they're into.
---
There are issues with Cranberry Bog's flat land, there are certain terrains that won't allow foundations to be placed.
---
That made me giggle... Just like in the game, the people exploiting others and the system are the people up top.
---
Bethesda please, for the sake of this man's/woman's legs, please we would appreciate it. 
---
P.S. also fix this persons legs too while you're at it. Thanks!
---
Give it a few more days and you'll be able to get score once again via the challenges.

Have you? Everyone who played the PTS has said heavy energy weapons are going to be less viable. BE gp was nerfed by like 80% soooo
---
When I was low on caps in my early levels, I sold all the legendary stuff I came upon to vendorbots. Make sure you take the Hard Bargain perk. Also, try to meet high level players, they tend to give gifts to low levels, sometimes they drop massive amounts of stimpaks, radaways, etc. which you can use or sell most of them.
---
I've run into it too. The only solid solution I've found is moving the camp, it'll either put it back into the stored tab or it'll free up the space for you to replace it.
---
I wish they would drop the cards altogether.
---
If they remove the double wall glitch and just add double wallpaper as a option wouldnt have to double up on the walls.. Makes more sense.. seems they are either incapable or just stubborn and don't want to do it..
---
That would be crazy tho.  Little one star comes rolling in. You slay them and get a god roll 3*
---
Ikr? Xd replying after 4 months
---
I love the complaints about weapons being nerfed. Shoot, every weapon I've ever had, for nearly the last two years, has seemed nerfed!!
---
Mostly because I had no idea of what to do with the perk cards (Yes I'm an idiot). So I'm not worried about nerfed weapons, but I am tremendously excited for everything else coming in this update.
---
The only negative to me is that the legendary run still has nuclear winter  requirement/option and it is requiring something called a "full team". I'm solo player, I don't do full teams and I definitely don't like doing nuclear winter. But aside from that, it looks fantastic in the PTS.
---
Yeah I've recently switched over from trialing a couple other more common rifles, and it's exactly what I'm after in a rifle. I've only experienced the base version so far though, so I'm overly keen on finding one like that haha.
---
I'm on PC and run it at least 2 times every weekend. I can tank all the pylons and pretty much do it solo, so if you want, send me your IGN and add me  Sgt\_OKeefe and you can join us. I'm usually on in the mornings and afternoons on the weekend (US Central Time).
---
Late for what?
---
Yes! Angry Turtle was at West teck and there was a super mutant that indeed had a magic laser!!!
---
That definitely livened things up!!
---
I've got the rifleman one because I use a sniper a lot and high sneak perk and pick them off from far away
---
Happened to me on PC as well, thought my keyboard was shitting itself.
---
Level 40 I think, 3 stars and it has 30% damage against robots, 50% limb damage and 20% VATs accuracy?
---
That's a damn fine leveling weapon. I'd keep it.
---
I just did loads of line in the sands.
---
2S accuracy is ass
---
Yeah the stars and you often pick them up from a legendary enemy. Can also save up script and buy them from the vendor at the rusty pick.
---
You can have my broadsider when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.
---
That's amazing. You have good friends.
---
Yeah I can see what you mean about the boss fights haha. As I made some regretful perk choices and only have a very basic lever action, I'm struggling a bit in some fights. Will definitely work on sorting that backup weapon out
---
Me too. I thought my controller broke. Had to back out and in just to make sure.
---
lol i don't want your broadsider
---
Ok then. Just wanted to make sure.
---
Nah. We'll be fine. A change or two here and there and it'll be easy.
---
LMFAOOO this whole thread is great bc of autocorrect. I feel your pain
---
Indeed I do! :) I was just lucky to get such incredible people in this community. It's not that common to.
---
My bloody explosive 25 vats railway is an absolute beast, and it never leaves my side. Choo Choo motherfuckers.
---
Yeahhhh there‚Äôs a lot of very fucking stupid and wildly annoying bugs in this game...gotta just take your lumps when you get em I guess, the nature of the beast.
---
Difficult question to answer. We don't know where you have been and you can't tell us what you haven't seen. 
---
I guess I'd look at the map and see if you have any large areas without markers. You can't go too far without stumbling across something.
---
Join a public team every time you log on. You can fast travel to your teammates camps for free and you get XP or stat buffs depending on what kind you join. Claim and defend workshops. Join as many public events as possible.
---
Definitely a combination that I'm interested in. What platform are you on?
---
I‚Äôll play with you later tonight psn TheBigCheeseDust
---
They will still provide the highest dps and be more viable then ever. Thanks but you can keep the sympathy for when yours and everyone‚Äôs build is nerfed haha
---
Just for the record every single fallout game I run stealth sniper so it was the first build I made on 76. I just enjoy the slow and tactical approach. 76 is so damn easy that running with a lower health and keeping that play style made sense to me. Rifleman and melee are going the be hit the hardest for sure. But every build is falling closer together in damage range. I definitely welcome some rework of the damage system, just hate seeing people on their high horse talking about bloodies when they haven‚Äôt looked into what the changes will actually bring.
---
Magine that build on a .50 cal machine gun....I‚Äôd shit my balls out
---
Only if they add elephants too
---
not if they‚Äôre all the same mask
---
You might be basing your post on old info. Bethesda did a PTS update where energy weapons were mostly fixed so they're about as equivalent as they were before.
---
I havent bro, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not complaining- have fun tho ::)
---
I‚Äôm just pretty much asking people to drop some spots that they enjoyed exploring, things they found on accident that are somewhat hidden. There is PLENTY of POI‚Äôs I haven‚Äôt discovered but only a handful are really, really fun things to explore just for the sake of exploring.
---
It‚Äôs not a hoarding game - it‚Äôs a scavenging game. The limits are designed to make it so you always feel a sense of scarcity, and you always feel a need for more. If you ever felt like you had ‚Äúenough‚Äù, you‚Äôd stop scavenging and ignore a major drive to keep playing.
---
What do you think the whole scrap donation thing was about? It‚Äôs to empty the enormous fallout 1st stashes people have built up, to give them a reason to keep collecting.
---
Maybe. All i know is I wish they were hostile. Or at least fight back after we attack. It just feels awful killing them. They just want to be left in peace to do what they do.
---
It's because the 10mm smg is barely completed. Half the sights aren't implemented and they haven't made a suppressor. It took them a year to add the drum mag
---
Now you got me wondering does tick blood tequila margarita work with ricochet?
---
Interesting theory this, especially since there is a crushed miner and a live miner behind a fence under the Rusty Pick...
---
The good news is that the ghouls levels will be more appropriate for you in two days, the bad news is that your weapons will do less damage in two days
---
Oh nice! I'll join if I can, ign is DarthKittie
---
It's not even a true unlimited storage.  It's unlimited junk storage.  The fact that even though I have unlimited junk storage I still have to keep an eye on my storage because of weapons ammo or appeals.
---
We already have Earle

[Bethesda's reaction when anyone asks them to alleviate this grind they've deliberately set up.](https://youtu.be/mn1hnlR0f40?t=2)
---
For now, I agree with some people - drop the least valuable ones off for someone else to scrip. The cap definitely does need to be heavily increased, though.
---
I‚Äôve honestly stopped even bothering with scrip. My weapons are as good as I need them, my solar armor has good enough effects and my PA/stealth suit will handle the rest. Until there‚Äôs a better single shot rifle out there, I‚Äôm saying screw the RNG.
---
Very few things do less damage than Grants Saber
---
I feel like Murgh would specifically arm them. She knows how dangerous we are, and ergo how dangerous the world is.
---
It's okay though - they gave **everyone** 50 points because some people had to respec cos of broken perks and nerfs, etc. That means that now the people who moved perk points aren't *any* worse off than the people who didn't, right?

hmm my generator version just shows as white when i try to place it, tried all over, but it wont be placed, the decorative one doesnt have any issues though.
---
Yes! I was minding my own business last night and two guys in power armor came and just started shooting me! I gave them both the thumbs down and  then one of them waved at me. But seriously. So rude!
---
You're probably doing it at way lower level than you should. It's tough to do it at a low level but doable if you're strategic about it
---
I am remembering now that is was hard on my lvl 100+ char in power armor. The game is rigged.
---
im 45
---
As hysterical a picture as your post paints...I do think, and I am new to this game in particular (not fallout in general or other massive online games), so maybe I‚Äôm misled on some points, but they seem to do this with all of their currency. Scrip, bullion and even caps. The limits they put on daily ‚Äúcash ins‚Äù is absolutely fucking ridiculous. 1400 caps, 200 bullion, and 150 scrip? I‚Äôve seen people saying that gathering bullion is a ‚Äúgrind.‚Äù But no, it really isn‚Äôt. You get the notes pretty fucking easily and in decent enough bulk from doing events that theoretically on paper, gathering the potential value and doing the work is easy as shit. But the limit they place on everyone daily is what makes it the grind...not the day in and day out tediousness of earning that value, bc you can farm a shit ton in one day if you find a good server. But they don‚Äôt let you access it. And it‚Äôs all in an attempt to keep ‚Äúgame balance‚Äù but you‚Äôre just punishing the people who put the work in by limiting them so heavily. I think all of their daily currency caps need to be raised immensely. Almost like they‚Äôre forcing you sign on everyday just to cash in the time you spent gathering the items you want to trade in.
---
I think were all well aware at how slow bethesda works on bug fixes, and 6 moths would fix about 1% of them if they get fixed at all, a year might have a couple fixed if that, the game would basically need to be without content from now until the unforseen future to have a fully comprehensive bug fix done, and odds are a lot wpuld return shortly after that anyway
---
I don't have a link, but a Bethesda community manager confirmed legendary perks are in patch 22
---
I do like that idea thanks, will keep it on mind for the next camp  i build.
---
This is an old tired topic. No perk should be passive. You're basically saying that these perks are worthless, that only combat perks matter.
---
If they're worth using, they're worth slotting in. Otherwise, why not just make all perks passive so you don't have to bother with switching between heavy, shotgun, melee with a side of commando.
---
I was up to something like 900 lbs of carry weight with a huge chunk of that 3 star legendary ranged weapons (a ghoul slayers radium rifle? really?) and I had this clever idea for a workaround. I would drop them in my camp so they were in a paper bag and go adventuring. at the end of my adventuring time I'd come back, pick them all up then exit. when I come back the next adventuring session repeat the same process. Well, I forgot to go back for my dropped weapons the last time I played and lost about 10 3 star legionaries.  
---
I'm not even that mad about it because I was just going to turn them into scrip anyway.
---
All the limits on progression and farming killed my motivation to play.
---
it will be the same day as the rest
---
This is exactly why I don‚Äôt drink from anyone‚Äôs camp. Honestly a good life lesson too
---
Actually, they've been quite active in this subreddit and have repeatedly stated they treat Reddit as one of their main sources of feedback.
---
Yes, this. Doesn‚Äôt even need to be faction leaders - there‚Äôs an NPC in the wayward he supposedly does this if we have negative rep with either faction... which you shouldn‚Äôt.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing. If it doesn‚Äôt have a use for me, I‚Äôm leaving it outside of the Rusty Pick with a bunch of ammo, plans and extra stimpaks that I don‚Äôt need. üòä
---
Sweet. Something to look forward to tomorrow then
---
tuesday yes
---
I found personally the best way to reduce my scrip numbers was to sell off all my 1 stars first, it reduces the most weight because obviously you can sell way more then the couple of 3 stars, then move to selling the 2 stars then the 3 stars
---
I've done it at 25 and succeeded several times.
---
The way to do it is not to take them on head on. Ambush, setup traps like mines next to cars for additional explosive power and lure them there to setting up escape routes so you can get away quickly without being swarmed. Also power armour/power armour frames can help with durability.
---
Like I said, if you're having trouble at that level, YOU are too low level to be able to handle the area with the way you play.
---
It‚Äôs been around for a long time, but the reminders are always appreciated!
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt see the point. I‚Äôm okay with the stun, since I‚Äôm almost never in a situation where it matters.
---
Thanks for this tip!
---
With chameleon, the pip boys lags out heavy on pc, I‚Äôm stuck forever in PA view
---
The term is prospector.
---
Railway is so awesome, my fave weapon.  Mines a j/e/faster reload.  Choo choo!
---
The stat adjustments just give me an option to try a build other than bloody without missing out on so much damage. Its gonna make other builds more viable and im all for it. My biggest problem is that I'll probably have to spend more time making ammo and farming ore and acid.
---
I'm a girl too and at level 48. They pick on me.
---
Thank you for finally saying this because there are so many people that are like ‚Äúif you have unlimited junk storage it‚Äôd be just as easy to have unlimited stash space‚Äù and I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs also the reason why your junk gets scrapped when going into the scrap box
---
i find that when either zooming and using the sights or using the pip boy, it works fantastic.
---
if you hip fire, 2s is ass.
---
Please!
---
it's so they dont take massive damage and have to spend even more resources repairing their armor...  quick kill, clear bounty, throw un-harmed armor back on and good to go.
---
I had to redo that quest from the start three times before I could finish it. Never had the card reader glitch out but Ra Ra would simply not open doors for me and at one point a robot wouldn't spawn that I needed to kill to continue. So much wasted ammo and frustration. I did stumble upon this when I was looking for a solution: https://devtrackers.gg/fallout/p/45388535-wastelanders-spoilers-quest-not-continuing. u/Ladydevann apparently said Bethesda knows the quest is horribly bugged and is "working on it" but I'm not sure how old the original post where she said this is.
---
When your legs are crushed just crawl that‚Äôs what I did 2 years ago when I was at max weight and had to walk across the entire map and yes walk not run not sprint walk slow as fu- slow as can be
---
But there might be a huge boon to keeping well fed and hydrated.
---
People will gravitate to what's meta but I've seen all sorts. LMG, gatling,minigun, combat rifles, teslas (too much of that for some), shotguns, lever action. You left out a whole category of energy weapons like the gatling lasers and plasmas. Melee is usually unarmed for the most part.
---
Not all weapons should be equally good, otherwise they're all effectively skins of each other. There are weapons that should categorically be better than others and other weapons still situationally better than others.
---
There are ways to make this happen on reddit, this isn‚Äôt it
---
Angry turtle put out a vid.  Non stealth tse is bonkers.
---
You *apparently* can, if you somehow end up hostile with a faction post-Vault Raid (which is not possible, even if you didn‚Äôt do all missions like 95% of players) if you talk to someone in Duchess‚Äô bar.
---
Yes but eventually the arms come back to her and she then distributes her currency out which also eventually comes back to her, thus keep her economy self sustaining, its big brained plans. Plus it could be seen more as a punishment for failure ‚Äúgo out and find me offerings - without weapons‚Äù
---
So how should i do it
---
Not like Someone who goes around following high levels hoping.
---
Try a trading fallout sub reddit
---
I don't follow your logic at all.. Im trying to make a suggestion to help the game.. Whatever man.. i grind em up anyways. üòÇ. Most weapons are garbage.
---
All 5 into demo expert
---
This post is dumb.
---
Ah okay I don‚Äôt usually use reddit first time kinda of thing
---
What would you do if you got rolling pins from the armor option through some glitch?
---
Seeing how people are eager to help I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if he can find someone from this post. No need to be condescending you look like a dick
---
Join a public Builder's Team, and then farm the heck out of daily quests and public events. you'll level up super fast at that level. The Builders Team gives you higher INT, which gives you more XP per everything you do.
---
Do the Feed the People event too, the reward gives you 5 cans (each time) of Canned Stew Meat... which gives you a 5% XP boost for an hour.
---
Once you get some more time in, you can also get a follower in your camp, and when you sleep, they give you another 5% XP boost too.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Join highly active quests like Line in the Sand, Radiation Rumble and Uranium Fever. Shoot everything that moves. Don't try to kill anything, just shoot it once, and then shoot the next thing that moves. Once someone else kills it, you will get credit for that kill, and thus XP (and can loot it after). These events are pretty intense for newer players, so find a safe spot to stand and just keep shooting everything that moves. An explosive weapon will help with this, as you don't even need to hit the mob, just near it, and the explosive damage will damage it enough to count for a kill after someone kills it.
---
I'm currently working on an article on cap farming, which goes hand in hand with event/quest farming, and in it I will be mentioning all of the fast/easy quests/dailies to do over and over again any time they come up. This will help you gain XP too. Once you find a few quick/easy events to do, just keep doing them anytime they show up on the map.
---
Also, take over a ton of workshops, and defend them when that event comes up too. Tons of XP, caps, plans and other rewards.
---
I have different characters for moments like these
---
RIP Attenbro 5.2 (Instigating/10Aim/15Reload LAR) you were a really fun gun.
---
It's not like I don't have multiple builds though and by all accounts my TSE Handmade will still be a fun useful gun, so I'm set - just lamenting the death (of usefulness) of 'ol trusty.
---
^^edit: ^^forgot ^^to ^^specify ^^gun
---
Even maxing out rad resist you‚Äôre still eating 10rads/sec.  Power Armor has hidden buff to rad resist that can‚Äôt be achieved outside PA/Chinese Stealth/ Hazmat
---
Its not about whats good.. They need to buff the weapons that are garbage.. 60damage for a assault rifle... trash.. broadsider doesnt do the damage it advertises.. üòÇ i dont care what anyone says ... my point stands..
---
Another fun fact: if you use a tesla gun at ACP you are a shithead.
---
I'm saying your point isn't valid.
---
The game is so loose and combat so unbalanced that pretty much most weapons and most builds are meta. Pretty much ANY auto weapon is fine for the end game (not even talking about the broken ones) and even people who lean hard into food builds are able to solo end game content.
---
Hell, stack the right buffs and legendaries become meaningless. There are plenty of videos of people melting SBQ with ordinary weapons.
---
And this is what you want to buff...?
---
Unless something changed isnt it only the way perk cards and effects calculate? Ie they don't multiply any more but add up.
---
Thus, isnt everyone being scaled the same?
---
Very nice fact that about 47 people could know
---
Mod box only. You can't learn any mods for them by scrapping, and there are no plans either. Fair question though.
---
90% of them are useless
---
Remember the losses you've had at the hands of the Purveyor.
---
Let the hate flow through you....
---
I just said the weapons...
---
Assault rifles..
---
Broadsiders.. 
---
Railway rifles.. just to name 3... its not fallout4 or fallout3 they dont do the damage they are supposed to be doing no sir your point is invalid... they might as well remove the weapons if they arent buffing anything.. i can play anyway i want but i wont use those.. ive played the bloodied ive used shotguns .. ive played heavy gunnner.. ive used all of the weapons i think i would know.. put more time into the game and then come talk to me.
---
Thank you.
---
I feel this on a spiritual level after pulling three broadsiders, two .50 cals, two harpoon guns, and an Lmg on top of all of the other legendaries I binge-purchased during the purveyor sale this weekend.
---
i own halloween smoke.. its defintely 1 to 1.  I have read in the past also that you only get one smoke machine and not one of each
---
Better theory Murmrgh is actually a brutal gun runner and sacrifices her own people for her own gain
---
Something that bugs me: There‚Äôs at least two Mole Miner corpses in the Rusty Pick, one in the wall. (Only found it because I was looking for food via cannibal.)
---
Increase the max limit of scrip too. I wasn't able to spend any before redeeming the 250 scrip from Legendary Run, so I basically lost 200.
---
If you're running on PC, I installed the Balloons mod. It replaces all meatpiles with a balloon stack. It sticks out of water, tall grass, and those annoying piles of ash/goo around Line in the Sand. Makes looting super efficient.
---
No, but they do come with neck holes that accommodate three heads
---
Like most other weapon mods, that's only obtained from scrapping guns
---
I kinda think most of the moleminers we encounter are like feral ghouls or scorched. Rabid racoons out in the day, looking to fight. True "healthy" moleminers are more reclusive. Maybe a more established society underground. Time will tell though.
---
Actually, very true. Next treasure hunter i see i will remember all those nocturnal rolling pins. Maybe even use one on them.
---

This is what I did.. I am spending my 1st month packing it full until I'll never need to scrap again... 
---
..except now I'm used to it and considering just doing the full year at a huge discount. That tent, and that scrapbox ...and the atoms (I am a big time campbuilder) are nice...  If the dev's keep making cool content, I guess it's worth the cost to pay them.

Yes

The current system is stupid

The work around is an alt that is 3738384lb overweight. Hop over to the alt, get your daily 150, hop back get it out the suitcase job done.

*Stares in The Dragon*
---
i have to disagree as a build take some of all your perks and those perk are never used together. having a full combat build does not take into account that i cannot do without some weight reduction perk and other stuff that i prefer.  
---
there is no other perk you would like WHEN you are scrapping armor and weapon and everyone can afford it if they have the perk as it only cost 1. there would be no adverse effect as you lose nothing of value in intelligence perk that would mess with your status.  having all perks passive would take out choice and make the process of leveling up very boring.  
---
are you telling me you have ammo smith on you when you go to a silo or do SBQ/Earl. some perk are worth swapping but i find it a bother to always do so only for a maximum of 2 minute of crafting every 2-3 session of play
---
&gt; put more time into the game and then come talk to me. 
---
That's adorable dude. I've been playing the game since beta. I know what I'm talking about. 
---
Just your weapon examples alone show that you don't know much about the game itself. Aside from the Broadsider (which you keep bringing up for some strange reason as if it's not meant to be a meme weapon, even in Fallout 4), the other weapons I've seen around. 
---
No mention of the weapons you mostly don't see at all like all the black powder weapons, gauss rifle, 40mm grenade launcher, missile launcher, laser pistol/rifles. 
---
I see both Assault rifles and railway rifles like a couple of times a week at least. Nowhere near the levels of the meta weapons of course but they're played and can hold their own.
---
Seems pretty unfair
---
What shouldve been done is that quest keys were always on a Boss that Respawns if you already did the quest , but the game would weekly wipe them from your inventory
---
you can sell off 1400 caps worth of junk per day.
---
With that, Go Shopping!
---
Vendor hop (yes, it costs caps... but cost of business)... and look for people selling ammo for 1cap/ea and bulk buy. No more ammo issues.  Same for Stimpacks and such. just look for the best prices. I've often seen people selling stacks of Stimpacks for 5 caps or less. You may need to hop servers a few times to find just the right deals too.
---
The Pharma Farma and Scrounger perk will be your friend for finding chems and ammo.
---
Sell off all chems you don't need each day, and sell all your un-needed ammo in your cam's vending machine (price it at 1 cap per roudn... otherwise it won't sell)
---
and do tons of events and dailies.. it all adds up very quickly.
---
2 days ago, I made 27,000 caps. Yesterday I made 11,000 caps. I did this all from my own camp vending machines by stocking the right items and selling them at the right prices.
---
Also a small amount was from my daily vendorbot sell off, and doing tons of events and daily quests.
---
I'm currently writing a 5 part article on this very subject of how to make caps.
---
Its been hours why do you care stop commenting
---
A lot of weapons need a tune up something fierce. They should all fill a niche use at least that means you could situationally use them.
---
Also, bugged weapons like the broadsider need to be fixed so they actually work.
---
Oh god. Is season grind 2 coming so quickly?
---
I actually did some quests since the last one finished.
---
To be clear, the silo can be run in under 15 minutes without glitching. Also, you can prep them ahead of time. A fully prepared silo can last 30-60 minutes before it resets, iirc.
---
Im currently not playing the game because im over 400lbs and my max is 340 in a pw. This made me not want to play the game and i just login every day to sell the trash i get and then buy some more. (Note that ive been playing at least 3 hours a day before that)
---
Ive never seen a game before trying so much to make you not want to play. thanks bethesda!
---
Damn I just finished moving stuff around to a bloodied stealth
---
Cause I have other things to do and can‚Äôt be on 24/7. 
---
All I was doing was saying it was unfair. Same can go to you, why‚Äôd you comment?
---
Bloodied is quite popular but TSE will make it's glorious? return
---
it isn't supposed to be a stealth commando or vats weapon, more run and gun. It's dps is nothing to scoff at, and it can be versatile
---
I own both, you can build both at the same time.
---
&gt; Back then it was two shot explosive guns but I remember reading an article saying they nerfed them to the ground. Are they still the best though even after that? 
---
Wait a couple of days. You might be surprised with the results.
---
So are the measurements in flamingo units or what?
---
Another fun fact- this has been a thing for ages my guy.
---
But big love to you for the effort!
---
To be fair some of the first players contributed a ton in brotherhood event. Almost 10-20k of items (except rarer stuff like cork and cement) donated each time. Lots of over encumbered waddling and crappy gift box items but at least the main goals were met and the two rewards I wanted most were achieved.
---
Honestly if they do this again though, they better have more then donations and actually think about late game characters, not the recycled mostly chems and booze box lol.
---
Aside from that I help new players and friends make stuff they want or need, repair turrets if I can etc. Something I wouldn't do if I was limited in materials.
---
 I find that going into 1st person (which I hate but I want my damn loot) and getting right up on the corpse will usually make it so it is lootable.  You have to get your vision underwater if that makes any sense, you will hear the sound as if you are swimming underwater.  Doesn't work everywhere but hopefully will help a bit.
---
Caught some people today stealing from my level 15 friend their level 300 100 and a level 80 pissed me off the 200 kept on pick locking all this water purifiers so I murdered him
---
The property tracker actually pointed to the body in the shallow stream üòÖ
---
I‚Äôm not even sure what gold bullion is used for lol
---
Xb1 ü§°
---
!00% agreed
---
Indeed... made 38,000 caps in the past 2ish days, legit.
---
Bought lots of nice things, moved a lot of junk/ammo/etc.
---
It's easy if you know how :) They are still the lifeblood of the game.
---
Ah well I only decided to mention this since most of the people who launch nukes don‚Äôt really know about this, or it could be that I get different servers idk.
---
There are two cool downs for each silo. One is the "reconstruction" cool down (2hrs), and that is server specific.  The other is your personal cooldown which keeps you from launching from that silo on any server for 3 hours.
---
Make sure you launch it into space like Musks tesla we want to track it
---
I actually play in 1st person, so I did try but the problem is that the water is just shallow/deep enough that I can‚Äôt actually submerge myself to see under it. I do what you describe in the mirelurk event in toxic valley though lol.
---
I had a harpoon with perfect legendary stats. Explosive, bloodied, mutant. Wtf murmurgh
---
Another great idea from the FO76 community that will probably not get implemented by Bethesda!
---
i stand corrected, thanks for the clarification!
---
I don't think it changes arbitrarily, but rather is based on a percentage roll. 
---
Check the FO4 section [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance) for the various formulas if you are really serious about digging into the meat of it.
---
Players cannot kill you unless you accepted their PvP handshake (or capped a workshop, which the game explicitly warns you about because it can be used to trigger PvP against you). If a high level player killed you, that's on you for playing their game.
---
Enable pacifist mode so you cannot accept PvP handshakes anymore. Problem solved.
---
You can't, you can only buy mods. Luckily the armor is inferior so not worth the caps anyway ü§∑üò•
---
Okay and thanks for the help. üòÅüëç
---
Are the base damage numbers really that unbalanced? Except for maybe som energy guns and explosive? I think the problem is more lack of damage buff Perks. Sneak multiplication make some weapons so much superior and everything else inferior, some useless. If you add automatic on top of that it just get so unbalanced you would never use anything else but automatic. Singel shot weapons needs new dps buff perk cards. You can't just raise the base damage. Or they would be too OP in the early gameplay, one shooting everything. Just an example, perk that makes you single action weapons empty the clip in one go(1.5 sec). Perk that makes you reload your weapon super fast. Just like the trail fireworks glitch. And so on.
---
What I do to skip the stagger after landing is I just pull out a melee weapon right before I land. works every time for me
---
No problem, the item count is weird since they are ATOM Shop items.  They have different effects (the halloween one is orange smoke with bats, mothman us just black smoke) so they are seperate items each with a build limit of one.
---
This bug presumably slipped through the PTS because on the PTS Monongah Mine was auto-nuked at regular intervals, and so ACP was perpetually triggered. This meant the bug never manifested itself because even if a nuke was dropped elsewhere, ACP was basically always active anyways so nobody noticed.
---
I'm just spitballing here of course. The question is, if this bug gets fixed in the next patch or not.
---
I think Its depressing but, also funny. GG
---
Well considering all I have is a machete now since I have to start all over even the nerfed two shot explosive handmade from back then would be a godsend right now lol.
---
Good....good...
---
Someone else said they should make them scrapable, with a RMG chamce to receive vault steel or a module or something. That way you get another pretty decent scrip sink
---
Why?
---
Sometimes the biggest perk of all is just realising dying doesn‚Äôt matter that much in this game
---
I wish I had a legendary one that was explosive
---
I don't particularly remember how weapons worked, but is it possible to get a bloodied, double shot explosive gun?
---
Firstly there's a known vats bug where it seemingly registers a hit but the enemy's health doesn't go down, so that obviously doesn't help but also damage drops over distance off but especially so for shotguns so it may be hitting but doing next to no damage.
---
They're both chinese.
---
To take time to do that just to rat on em. Like they should not be doing that but, I wouldnt actively go searching for it.
---
Normally don't go actively but like when I'm passing by a base I normally check it out just in case
---
My friends turrets opened up on Graham
---
He dutifully destroyed half of his camp while the game refused to let him leave the world as he was in a team
---
I did laugh a little bit
---
But thank you for the feedback
---
You kinda can scrap ammo with the legendary exchange machine. They balanced it so it‚Äôs definitely a chore.
---
Well thanks for answering the question I had when I found out about this, I don‚Äôt have the PTS of fo76 so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find out myself, didn‚Äôt expect to get a answer in less then 30 minutes but anyway thanks!
---
Are you on PS4? I have a small crew of friends over lvl 300+
---
Indeed.
---
Today is the first day I haven't played since May. Not because I didn't want to, but because I simply *can't*. Not without going through the hassle of mules and burdening a friend to log on just to transfer back and forth...
---
The sale has backfired for me. Loading me down with useless scrip fodder, pushing my stash to the limit despite having 1st and forcing me to 'store' 3stars in my inventory. So now I'm over encumbered but unwilling to scrap or sell anything and just waiting for the damn timer to reset so I can get back to playing. 
---
But, as I didn't start playing at my usual time I got sidetracked by something else and missed my chance to cash in today...
---
If this pattern repeats enough, I'll have moved on without actually wanting to and well, that's never a good strategy for player retention.
---
I know about time sinks and the need for them with online games, I'm aware they want us logging in daily, but this limit is antithesis to that goal.
---
Np! :)
---
I does not get "deleted" when you log off, it remains on the server. In regards to how many would build at Tyler County if it wasn't a PVP zone? Far more than currently use it for PVP. There are far more builder players in the game than PvPers, yet none of them can use them as they are now.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. It‚Äôs not even the fact that low levels are in there although they don‚Äôt help at all I can still fight earl by myself, but not only do I have to fight him solo I have to fight 200 wendigos solo and also avoid falling stuff and acid pools lmao.
---
Nope, Bloodied or TS
---
Edit: But you can have a BE or a TSE
---
That‚Äôs a little overzealous my mans. You‚Äôre cheating your way through doors to ensure other people aren‚Äôt cheating... since your both using exploits....
---
Good point
---
Thank you for the feedback
---
add me.  I mostly play with it on.  Ill.be passing out soon.  Sinistrmark is psn.
---
I fought earl, survived all the way to his death and soon as I got close to him I died and spawn outside the vault. This happens almost every time. I stopped running the event.
---
While I agree pistols need a slight buff, I don't think they should be able to match the damage of rifles or heavy gun. And there are many reasons for this. 
---
 - Recoil: The longer the barrel, the lower the recoil. This is caused by the blast created by the bullet exiting the barrel being further from the shooter. Shorter barrel also means less weight, making the felt recoil higher than a long barrel. 
---
 - Sound: A longer barrel gives the pressure from a fired bullet more time to decrease before it exits the barrel. This makes the sounds smaller.
---
 - Muzzle velocity: The longer the barrel the higher the muzzle velocity, allowing the bullet more time to accelerate before leaving the barrel. Although, the longer the barrel gets the more it slows down a bullet due to losing velocity from barrel friction. Standard legth of a 5.56 barrel is roughly 21 inches. 
---
 - Stopping Power: More muzzle velocity = more muzzle energy
---
For these reasons, a pistol shouldn't be able to match a rifle or heavy gun in damage.
---
Ahh gotcha thanks! Hopefully i'll eventually get another two shot explosive weapon then as iirc bloodied relied on you being lower hp, think it took like 200+ hours the first time.  Hopefully they've had some major content updates though to make farming for them easier this time around though.
---
Yeah... But I've tried doing almost point blank range but it's still not hitting the target... So I'm starting to believe this effect isn't working... I'm also using full unyielding build with all shotgun damage perks. It should be doing enough damage to register....
---
Couldn't agree more. No other duped item damaged this game as a whole as much as these presents.
---
I think the closing thing would be the ammo converter. If you were able to scrap ammo in the same fashion as junk and gear, getting even 1 material is a lot for most ammunition as it takes less to craft more ammo. It would be pretty broken.
---
ex.: .50 cal 
---
12 gunpowder + 10 lead + 40 steel = 100\~180 rounds
---
On the other hand, if the ammo converter had the option to give you scrap for points...
---
You earn the plans from doing Daily Ops, and if you know the plans you have a chance at getting legendary versions like how it works with the Fixer or Bear Arm. Mod plans are sold by Regs in Vault 79. 
---
It's comparable to the Super Sledge in base damage, but with mods it's split pretty evenly between physical and elemental damage. IMO the Cryo version is the best since the freezing effect is the most useful. I didn't find a good legendary version in the PTS but I think it'll be really strong.
---
You might end up taking too much damage from your own rounds with explosive rounds on a close range gun.
---
AP Refresh on armour, one piece of Chameleon, and a couple pieces that make you harder to detect. Or the CSS instead of armour.  You should be in stealth all the time
---
Marsupial  helps you stay out of trouble.  
---
You can use Stealth perks but they aren't always necessary depending on what else you have. Goal should be to get Agi to at least 20.  You don't need Unyielding, this can be done with Bird Bones, food buffs and possibly +1 Agi armour.
---
A suppressor on your weapon is needed. 
---
Stay up high, when the enemies begin to start looking for you then move position.  If they find you and you can't move then use cover, even if it means jumping on top and behind a vehicle or backing up on a roof so they have to run around.
---
Not really a problem. In the agility tree, all the sneak perks come out and max level Dodgy and Adrenaline go in, in their place.
---
Perk loadouts, whenever they arrive, will make this much easier to manage.
---
I'm close enough where im not taking explosive damage but also close enough that VATS should be able to hit and damage. But it's still not doing "100%" hit. Unless this legendary effects only applies to one single pellets from the rounds... This is why I'm confused.
---
Murmgh has no sympathy. She is smiling beneath that breather.
---
My solution to this dilemma was to transfer a bunch of legendaries to a mule. Of course, my xbox chose the moment I finished placing them in a container to crash. Bye bye legendaries. Problem solved.
---
If that's always happening, that's one thing. If it happens sometimes, it's the vats bug I was talking about. How much damage you do or don't do has nothing to do with whether or not the hit registers with this bug.
---
Only other thing I can suggest is that sometime if you shoot immediately after you activate vats I've found you just outright miss. Maybe give it a half beat pause before shooting, like vats -&gt; pause -&gt; shoot. See if that helps.
---
You want this.... Don't you....
---
As much as this made me laugh, I feel your pain. Ohhhhhh I feel your pain :-(
---
Just be sure to be on a team? You can always join back into the server, just write down a few names or two in case. I join random 4 person teams all the time and haven‚Äôt had any scares
---
Yeah... For now I'm just gonna script my Stalker weapons....
---
I'm testing my Stalker bow and it's the same too. Not in combat, within the damage range, VATS not hitting anything.
---
Honestly stalker isn‚Äôt the effect you want so unless you have to use it I wouldn‚Äôt. VATS is never 100% I don‚Äôt care what anyone says. I have to shoot people 3 times because the first 2 hit and do nothing sometimes. Other times enemies keep moving for 2-4 seconds after I shot them.
---
Because you cannot "save" your progress as a blueprint.
---
If there was no PVP, there would still be very few builders there.
---
This fix requires infrastructure.
---
Maybe. Why do you think Bethesda goes out of their way to not make it a thing to the point that they created the ammo converter machine for this purpose with terrible conversion rates just to give us some amount of this functionality.
---
I guess it depends where you build your camp. My camp is set up just outside of the train station near Top of the World, it‚Äôs often under attack. Super mutant and mongrel dog corpses litter the highway. The recently sold communist fence creates a perfect kill zone since enemies can‚Äôt target it but turrets can shoot through it
---
 use a vff fr  galling ultracite laser and can solo encrypted on my full health heavy gunner. only die on reload.
---
You either are in a spot without a valid encounter spot, or you bulldozed it with a foundation block.
---
No. The quests will be around after the update.
---
I disagree, the reason PvP has been so greatly reduced in 76 is because Bethesda keeps trying to get PvE players to PvP. The same as your suggestion to buff workshop resources, all you will get is more angry PvE players.   
---
 PvP should have rewards that only benefit PvP. The incentives they included in the survivor mode is what killed the mode. (exp bonus, unique legendaries)  
---
Players who enjoy killing PvE players is what killed PvP. Look at how my suggestion for PvP daily ops is being down voted, nobody wants fair PvP they want to gank foodbuilds and troll.
---
My main is Bloodied sneak build but I got this 3* Stalker Explosive VATS damage shotgun. My assumption was I will be able to hit all explosive pellet on the first round even at a distance... Turns out the effect is almost worthless...
---
Amen brother, couldn‚Äôt agree more. I would also love if we could get the backpack attachments for the Fallout 3 Rock-it-Launcher (aka junk jet, aka garbage launcher) and/or the Shishkebab. I always gravitate towards the make shift, junk town jerky vendor lookin stuff. So this would be absolute bliss for me
---
I have two shot on a hunting rifle, the recoil is barely worse and easily controlled. I imagine it‚Äôs much worse on a heavy weapon though
---
Stop playing cop
---
Don't forget lying to the sheriff.
---
Oh I so agree with you!! I hate killing the treasure hunters.. it's just a senseless massacre of gentle creatures!! It's kind of like killing the sloth, but at least if provoked, he'll fight back. 
---
I honestly feel so guilt ridden, that if Bethesda doesn't make them aggressive, I'm going to skip the entire event.
---
At least give us an option to sell items for less than they're worth. I have several dozen weapons in my pack and every day I'm sitting here staring at 30 scrip I can't access because she insists on paying 40 for every one of them. It's bad enough that the limit is so low, but to be unable to get even that much because she's the dumbest trader in the world is just a kick in the head.
---
Maybe like the ammo converter, require like a certain number of rounds to scrap? idk
---
The best big gun in the game right now is the gauss mini gun you can buy from the raiders when you get enough reputation. They‚Äôre all legendary when you craft them so it‚Äôs much easier to get s good AA,Bloodied, or whatever. Gauss minigun automatically has explosive rounds too. Plasma Caster which you can get in vault 79 is pretty powerful too.
---
I disagree, I often build nice workshops (i enjoy building and workshops let me do it for free), but I'm not against PvP and even when I do I almost never get challenged for it. There just is not enough PvP players and the rest are so opposed to PvP they avoid workshops like the plague.
---
The explosive effect needs Demolition expert 5 to be super noticeable if thats what you mean.
---
They dislike your post but you spit the truth.
---
I love killing people at workshops and taking all their junk
---
Try taking the right perks. 
---
You're clearly not using sneak if ghouls are causing this much trouble, so something to consider there.
---
Blocker is a perk in str that reduces incoming melee damage significantly. Another consideration there.
---
Ghouls have next to no armour and quite low hp pools outside of events (like 450 to 650 hp for max level non glowing ghouls). A lv 20 automatic weapon can make Swiss cheese out of even lv 60+ ghouls before they can reach you. Accuracy is a major factor for that one.
---
There's also a whole range of equipment in this game that is specifically anti-ghoul, this includes weapons and armour.
---
Lastly, try using a shotgun with enforcer perk. Vats aim for the legs, or manually do it if you have the dexterity. Ghouls aren't going to be a threat if they have no legs, and with an enforcer shotgun, you can often cripple multiple ghouls with 1 shot.
---
Playstyle can be a major factor in how tough certain enemies are. If what everyone is suggesting is against your play style, then you have to adapt something else to overcome your character's traits.
---
Had no idea. Never had a problem myself with it.
---
I feel your pain, myself and various other friends missed out on it as well. But good news, my friend!.. It‚Äôs coming back to the atomic shop on the September 15th. Supposed to be on there for a full week this time. So all my fellow scavengers who missed the 1st time, don‚Äôt let history repeat itself! I know I won‚Äôt.
---
I mean, yes and no? In the current state of the game it would be a broken ass nightmare. But then again, people who have millions of duped ammo can just...you know, dupe lead and steel, too
---
Do you auto it?
---
I have a VE\_something railway, and when I use it out of VATS in full auto, all I see is sky.
---
so community feedback is point blank bad to you?
---
Rocks falling are fire damage. If you equip asbestos lining on your chest armor you will be immune to it (I can vouch for this).
---
If you're in power armor I'm not sure. Maybe the upcoming legendary perks will help.
---
Yeah hopefully, I wear a full set of T65 and still get destroyed by the falling stuff lol.
---
I posed as a rapist and raped women to catch other rapists raping people. 
---
Think about that.
---
I know it‚Äôs not that serious, but come on.
---
"Just sell your excess legendaries to NPC's" 
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
A good way of doing this would be something like the Settlement Defense pack from Fallout 4.
---
You set up a raid siren, and whenever you turn it on a massive wave attack comes towards you which you get flag rewards for fending off.
---
Vigilante justice in this game always has been and always will be stupid. You know as well as the rest of us that reporting them won't do fuck all. Bethesda unbanned people with infinite ammo binocular rifles and MIRV miniguns, not to mention millions of duped ammo/nuka quantums. They aren't going to do anything to people slowly amassing cheated ammo
---
Yes, commando and vats, it‚Äôs very powerful.  Rarely need a whole clip.
---
Don't you only have to kill *a feral ghoul* and not one in particular? So just go to morgantown instead of sticking around whitesprings?
---
(sorry, it's been a while since I've done the quest)
---
Are you joking, or?
---
Don‚Äôt worry man; I‚Äôll attack your base. What‚Äôs your username and platform?
---
My commando has it so easy compared to my heavy gunner. It has a completely different feel when the ceiling won't kill you (especially when trying to get to earls body).
---
There are a few safe areas and I try to stick to those with my heavy gunner and they help somewhat.
---
They could probably cut that damage in half and it might be barely acceptable
---
Thanks a bunch for the heads up, i'll start ranking up now so I can eventually get that then!
---
This happened to me I dropped his health down to like 35% then I died by the fire and he was already mutated and I‚Äôm here watching the top right waiting to respawn and his health is going back up
---
Thats why im wearing my mining helmet all the time

I think the funniest part about this update is they rebalanced the game but apparently did not fix the broken weapons. (at least on PTS) Anyone that has one of these guns with a broken prefix is going to be at an even greater advantage in One Wasteland as builds have saw their damage output reduced acrossed the board from what I understand.
---
And here I was, thinking he was going to launch them using the spike traps.
---
Best source of information in general
---
Wait who-
---
I got a troubleshooter's fatman from him today.
---
I don't know. I know I've seen them often enough that they're always on the left side of the machine if you're facing one.
---
I like the theory, but we all do the same thing as the mole miners do, at least for those of us who like earning scrip!
---
Most of us won't even shoot back if another player shoots at us too xd. We also drop junk when we die. Not legendaries though.
---
Anyway, the theory would imply we are not bringing enough legendaries to purveyor, or, alternatively, that we charge too much scrip for what we bring.
---
This could mean treasure hunter mole miners are under cutting us and resulting in an artificially low scrip daily limit. Eliminate them, and mumbles needs us even more!
---
Yo add me ninjapenguinguy we run 6 people deep and nuke non stop and do whatever
---
Reasons!
---
For me, I only get the ally mission once every other day, so a 2 day delay between missions.
---
hell yeah! you on now?
---
You on?
---
Ill be on all day tomorrow and the next day, I get off work 8 am pst
---
Stalker on a shotgun is pretty useless. I have it on combat rifle though and its OK. With stalker effect you need to allow time for the connection issue. Hitting VATS button then firing straight away is not always going to work. I wait a second or so then fire and it works 99% of the time.
---
Only issue I have with workshop pvp is when people fight non stop for your workshop just to take it from you, possibly destroy everything you've built, and then leave the server. The point of pvp at workshops is to take the workshop. If you don't want the workshop, why are you killing me for it, destroying everything, and then leaving the game? Shit makes no sense.
---
Uh what? You can't drop a gauss pistol... it deletes on drop just like the armour pieces. You sure it wasn't a rifle?
---
ty so much for pointing this out
---
I had like 5 nocturnal fixers drop, during this sale
---
That's how I started as well. But caps definitely have lost value. You used to see a fair amount of stuff on the market sub for caps. Now most everybody doesn't want them
---
Stasi from the former DDR would have been be proud to have you as an employee...
---
And pass the ammunition (read with title lol)
---
Rocks falling isn't a thing when I'm in PA, just keep use stimpak while at half HP or less, every ACP event cost me about 150 to 200 stimpaks. Stimpak is cheap and ease to find.
---
If the update comes it's still bethesda
---
You need to get general grant's sword from one of the bungalow rooms at the Whitesprings. That's tough to do if you're low level or not prepared as those ghouls hit hard.
---
You're right about the other thing though, when it comes to getting swing data.
---
I'd like my perks to have an order that makes sense. Why are the lock picking skills not next to each other, why do I have to search for them constantly.
---
I rock my hellfire pa, when I jump out I'm in the responders fireman uniform with the makeshift samurai helm on
---
I use the Board.  Sometimes.
---
I crafted a gauss pistol a couple weeks ago just to try and it worked.. must have been a bug but i will retry dropping one and see what happens now.
---
You dont just have 20 levels of cards you havnt redeemed ?
---
No, it is a free dlc that will be here forever
---
Acceptablevi would say
---
I had my camp in a tunnel. Nothing can snap nicely... it is a shame really... good game but...
---
Yes we know
---
I'm on xbox or else I would 100% I just got a gauss minigun that's op so tryna get more ammo
---
The pails are getting much better the next time the event rolls around, with more unique items and less crap (no mounted heads!).
---
Also, there's a way to make it "autocast" sending damage to all enemies in a large radius in one popular hacking tool. I dunno why they even bothered to move around, they could've just stand still somewhere in the tunnel leading to the main hall without drawing much attention.
---
There's also an option not to be a dick right within this same tool that allows to send only small fixed amount of damage to each mob without killing them so other people will have a chance to shoot at them.
---
Me my psn is edwinpresto1938
---
If you're  using Rejuvenated and always those buffs up then sure... but if you're already doing that anyway you're not getting anything extra out of the buffs, you're just spending a legendary perk slot and four ranks into a legendary perk just so you don't have to carry food and water around and only have to use one hotkey.
---
Is it wrong to have no life? No. Is it sad? Definitely.
---
I heard theres a 7 day waiting period for the trading one so I figured I'd give it a shot
---
No.    
---
It's a permanent add-on to the game. Without spoiling too much it explains why 76 started out without human NPCs.
---
Major is a bit if a stretch. They added a few small quest lines. And 1 big one that might take awhile if you're low level, but I was able to do it in like 3 days without serious grinding.
---
There's a bug patch coming Tuesday with a damage rebalance and enemy's level scaling will be changing
---
I got a bloody bashing 90% weight .50cal and a furious 25% fr 15% crit .50cal somewhat recently so as much as I hate her she gives me some nice things sometimes
---
Ayy I didn‚Äôt know other people did this too!
---
If you're careful and take your time you can sneak into that house, get the holotape for the code, get the sword and get out without being seen or attacked. If you have Sneak and/or an armor piece with Chameleon it makes it easier.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs truth lmfao like where‚Äôd they go so wrong.
---
why do you think the armor is inferior? I mean, yes Secret Service is certainly better but I still think it's a valid option. Especially since you'd have to go through the whole wasteland quest to get the SecServ armor. 
---
The urban/forrest armor got the highest damage resistance of all the common armors - and it's lightweight. 
---
The lack of plans is certainly a drawback - without those you'll have to fork out a lot of caps at the Enclave vendor - but still...
---
I keep getting 30 atoms every day 
---
Yesterday I was at 1200 4 days ago now im 1320 atoms
---
Unfortunately when you're at the point of carrying 14 3star weapons that isn't an option üò•
---
I mean... I don‚Äôt recall any bicycles on the map...
---
Alternatively, you could place a few mines down and have a Blood Eagle walk over them. They‚Äôre kind of a biker gang, right?
---
Call it the stealth boy backpack and charge a bunch of atoms. I‚Äôd buy it.
---
Dude, it was a typo, it happens.
---
I have never head of that before. You just have to format your title properly. Look how everyone else does it and do it like that.
---
Edit, also reply to people. Don't just post another comment
---
I sometimes play with my controller under a blanket and it works just as fast. Unless it‚Äôs hot where you are
---
For future reference, the odds of you getting anything useful is with a character who doesn't have ANY legendary equipment.    
---
My 2nd char who is a shotgun build got 4 good drops. It had the Civil Authority shotgun which I think has a max lower level. While the gear and weapon was not my optimal choice everything increased my player quite a bit considering.    
---
You're better off being patient and hitting player vendors. Even then you're not guaranteed to get the effects you want.    
---
76 is an MMO at its core. The fact that the Miner Lady and most quest drops are random with gear is done on purpose. All MMOs are a time sink.
---
Have you noticed how many scrip limit threads there have been since the sale started?
---
If you have seen all of them then you should know that asking for this is not new and asking AGAIN on top of everyone else isn't going to make it happening any more likely.
---
If you haven't seen all of them that's because people have asked for this soooooooooooooo often that's it's literally against the rules to keep bringing it up at this point and the mods keep having to remove all of the threads.
---
Yeah, I know. That's what I was playing off.
---
If we scrap a card, are we going to be able to buy it back later?
---
If we have full set of every level of a card and we scrap one, will Perk Packs be able to drop that card again?
---
Or... You could do a lot of crafting and modding, using copious amounts of excess adhesive, to the point that you need a mutfruit/corn/tato plantation, and plenty of purified water. Although, to your point, I don't suppose everyone does, and yet still wants this prime real estate.
---
You can't move after exceeding a certain amount of weight limitation. For example there was a post warning about not to cash in the max number of mininukes at the ammo machine, as it exceeds that limit and you can move afterwards unless you drop off some weight.
---
Welcome to the club my friend...
---
Ahh, thanks for the info.

IIRC, don't the ghouls at Whitesprings generally spawn around your level or at least for whoever stopped by recently or such? When I tried power-leveling a new character at the golf club, I usually ran into ghouls at level but on occassion, I would get level 62 ghouls that gave me a hefty chunk of xp.
---
I find all ballistic heavys to be very usable as well as the flamer and ult gat. I actually rarely touch my 50cal in favour of my ult gat
---
Rifles and melee are pretty skewed to a few weapons though
---
Ammo factory, legendary intelligence, follow through, sizzling style, survival chem (i forgot what it‚Äôs called), and legendary endurance
---
This is my play too.
---
People always tell me to stop hoarding and I'm like bro I'm not letting these weapons just go to waste I mean, really
---
Claim unclaimed workshops and do the first defend event then leave it move onto the next workshop and repeat. I'm leveling a new character and I do this and clear new gad to level
---
What exactly is cursed?
---
I see you're using the FFR technique. Do you plan on using explosive type weapons? or grenades? I'm thinking if you are possibly going to use power armor, you might want power user, at least on standby.
---
That bike better be in air rn
---
Jokes on you I pick up everything I find scrap it all and dump what I don't want on FO1st members.
---
With that in mind I should be able to scrap legendaries into vouchers to be traded for scrip so I dont have to carry all the 3 star legendaries around cause my stash is full of junk and junk alone cause I refuse to feed the cash cow
---
 I can max my daily scrip in a single run of arkos pharma ffs legendary farming isn't worth doing cause they are so damn common you'd have to drop 3-5 an hour to stay underweight if you were running an ideal route
---
I save up steel and trade it for lead so I can craft bulk amounts of ammo to feed my .50cal cause she's a hungry lady
---
With friends like that I feel sorry for your enemies. Welcome back.

---
Interesting build though for me evasive seems like dead weight. I would have more gone Action Boy/Girl for that instead given you're dipping your toe into VATS.
---
Maybe even swap out batteries included for power user if you ever decide to use energy heavy weapons.
---
FFR? If you scroll down you will see my weapon/armor combo I currently have :) I will keep power user in mind :)
---
You might want to check with xbox support as well, just to confirm that this is Bethesda issue, if you haven't done that already.
---
Happened to me twice. I'm on PC.
---
This exact thing happened to me, yo
---
Yes this is true too. Getting the perfect roll for AR is easier than handmade or fixer, and could make up for the dps difference in some  cases with perks such as ffr or explosive. 
---
For those who already own the best rolls of the fixer or handmades, I think the choice is much easier to say no to assault rifle.
---
Especially with this weekend sale, a lot of god roll ARs sitting in vendors out there haha
---
Should just remove the limit entirely tbh. I wouldn't even mind if they tanked the trade in value. But anything is better than the current system where you're better off just selling legendaries then server hopping until you find a player vendor with what you're after.
---
Oh yes you're right! üòà And thank you!
---
I was honestly thinking aboit moving that point to intelegence for more xp gain but couldn't find a perk to get use of so yes might swap in for action boy/girl :)
---
Absolutley will if I get a decent roll on one but if people choose to use this and have energy heavys it's an easy swap for them :)
---
‚ÄúOh no, looks like I‚Äôve accidentally set off a nuke again‚Äù
---
Sorry i‚Äôm just imagining the title of this post.
---
Then instead of doing rep grind people would just gold dump into a faction for the rep. Or am I wrong? Seems like an interesting idea but I don't think it's a good one, maybe you can convince me otherwise idk
---
You do know that you wear a disguise in Fallout 4 to infiltrate the Brotherhood?
---
Being the second largest presence in Appalachia, I won‚Äôt be surprise that there are factions within the mole miners, maybe the hostile ones are raiders.
---
LOL ü§£
---
*throws bike in junk mortar*
---
Prepare for launch.
---
I just want to be able to jump from somewhere high, or attempt to jetpack across a gap without the game attempting to "correct" my position and placing me back where I was.
---
Lolol oh dear, silly me
---
Flamingo units should be 20 of these, since you can build 500 flamingo units, and you have 10K of total space.
---
or add a feature to slope to the level on that wall will the same terrain type (like terraforming tiles)
---
If everyone dies he regenerates.
---
Low durability guns tend to break near the end of a solo elder run for me, a beam splitter ultracite auto laser broke after about 6 minutes without any ranks of gunsmith. Considering that would be 1-2 minutes normally, it's a pretty good decrease to the durability drain imo
---
Yea i've had that happen to me during a queen where everyone died, but only 1 out of my group died during the event
---
Awesome thanks for the info!
---
There's no way to convert unspent perk points into perk coins, you have to redeem a bunch of perks one by one and then scrap them one by one
---
Just a bit of a tip for getting more reputation, try and go to Ohio River Adventure to give mirelurk meat every day, do the Photo Opportunity quest for the overseer and give the photo to the raiders, the standard raider daily quest to max it out faster, and some random encounter settler/raider fight spawns can give you reputation easily.
---
Lol go attack someone at their camp get hostile with them and see for yourself
---
I mostly see missing opportunities with the random encounters and the allies in the camp. 
---
Since they want to add repeatabke content that would fine and will add some variety instead of just chasing raiders and vacum tubes. 
---
Or maybe have a camp item just for workshops that allow one of the factions to run it, you lost the materials but now have a reppeatable event of defending or attacking that depend of the faction you are supporting
---
We could give a use to Claim Tokens at the same time
---
I missed last years and not sure how it works. Should I be saving any junk material or anything for thr lead up to the event?
---
If you do the Lying Lowe sidequest, and its associated mysteries (the mysteries aren't too difficult, but they're intriguing story-wise), it culminates with the Encryptid event; which shouldn't be too hard on a public server, assuming people use some basic common sense and read the instructions, but many people (not myself, mind you) find a challenge to solo. Likewise, the Free Range event, which depending on where it spawns, has some nice high level baddies, that aren't really buttpuckering by themselves, but when you're trying to keep 3 of the stupidest brahmin alive at the same time, can be quite the experience.
---
Yeah. Go to R. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6bit without the periods. I wouldn't say its something you can specialise in though
---
Ps4, and sorry I was asleep so I didn‚Äôt see your reply.
---
I meant like the vending machines. Are they worth it should I specialize in there?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt. The miners will now be spawning in every region, so there‚Äôs more of them, and the cost for buying the... whatever the equivalent is for wrapping paper is significantly lower.
---
Yes it is moral... also there is a lot of fun to be found in the game. And a pretty solid community to play with. PC can have issues with hackers.
---
Dafuq?
---
How would you specialise in them? I do find them worth it, I get a pretty steady supply of caps selling mid tier gear in them
---
Only 14? I have full weight reducing arnour i carry dozens at any time
---
Your ideas of removing teams from NW or any mode in Fallout in general are not good, the game was meant to be played with friends
---
I.E selling one particular type of thing like only junk or equipment ETC
---
I think it would be funny to show up at the camp you considered suspicious wearing the cop uniform and playing a cop siren over the mic and then interview them.
---
Yeah
---
Ah ok
---
Moral? Is playing a game a political position?
---
I'm also usually carrying 3k steel and other junk I can't fit in my storage. Luckily I rarely die
---
So all I'll need is caps to buy pails or something?
---
You are best off selling a wide variety of gear. Weapons, armour, junk, ammo. If you have a good variety people are emote likely to come visit you. Also please don't sell non legendary gear, unless you're in the forest and it's for low levels
---
Any money spent on 76 will get you cosmetic or camp items only. There is absolutely nothing about this game that is pay to win, no matter how much those dumbass naysayers will try to tell you. There are no loot boxes.
---
Just play the damn game. It's good.
---
New Vegas was by far a much better game, I hoped so much that they would be allowed to do another, rather like call of duty. Have 2 developers working on the same game and see who can do a better job. 
---
That being said, fallout 76 is an amazing game, yes it has its flaws and being Bethesda they are quite frequent. If you played fallout 4 you will know what a buggy mess that was, no imagine that with server/connection problems. It is still how ever worth picking up. There is tonnes of content to keep the average gamer going for a few months.
---
So is my camp being in the cranberry bog a bad idea?
---
Ok thank you for letting me know
---
You can do what ever you want man. But I came to a camp in the bog and it was full of non legendary gear I would be very disappointed
---
How could you not know about the pvp? If you claim a workshop there is a big square at your screen with "claiming this may result in pvp, you sure about that?" You have to klick yes or no ...there is no way backing off this window without klicking yes or no ...so how did you not know about the pvp aspects of workshops
---
Got ya thanks. But is the glitch where they can access your stash still happening?
---
If you've handled all the wayward quests, have you done the original story? Like did you volunteer for the responders, go up to morgantown airport and all that? I don't know if ' Ounce of Prevention' is still bugged, but you should get at least that far.
---
Beyond that, what I normally do, is claim workshops, fast travel to camps in other areas of the map, and try to discover the locations. 
---
Finally, the quest 'Mistaken Identity' and its associated dailies at Camden Park. These give solid XP for minimal effort. The Mistaken Identity quest will give you 3 quests, that will also start giving you scrip. Do all 3, and you'll get a 4th dose of XP (just the first time though), then every day, those quests will pop up in rotation.
---
Not that I'm aware of
---
Ah fair i have 1st so my jump is safely stashed
---
Cool that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been avoiding it
---
Same. Shot one robot and nothing else happen
---
You'll be fine man. I've had mine up for quite awhile now
---
Oh my god dude. You need to learn to never listen to YongYea. Ever.
---
I am no apologist for Bethesda but Yongyea is one of the worst out there. Muckraking low effort youtuber who will skim the hot posts on reddit for content but not look beyond the surface with any issues.
---
If you want a prime example of this low effort, find one of the old videos on the 900 hours guy controversy where be supposedly got banned for no reason. If you read the full post as well as the comments it became very clear that the story of the person who had made that post didn't add up and that they were very deserving of that ban. Oddly enough, no correction from Yongyea and the video was never taken down during that time.
---
He's not about providing good info. It's all about the drama and views. He's a grifter. So long as he can cash in, that's all he cares about.
---
If you watch enough of his content, you'll notice this too.
---
If you want to get all moralistic, that's on you to decide if that's right for you. We can't tell you what your morals are or not. The game is a buggy mess but still playable enough for the most part. It's very much a low effort cynical cash grab of a game from a multi-studio, multi-billion dollar corporation that could put the money and effort to lift the game considerably if they chose to.
---
There is value and fun to be had with the game but if you do decide to take the plunge, I'd suggest never paying full price for the game and pay with the mind that you're getting what value you see now. Don't spend money on what you think might come in future. Only disappointed lies there.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Go buy bulk lead and do uranium fever event pickup loot every moleminer scrap it craft it your self
---
Looks like fun! :)
---
2 disconnects so far. and the worst type.
---
crashes on load screen at mine exit, so no event complete pops or rewards.
---
XB
---
Shovel, Pickaxe and Harpoon Gun
---
I‚Äôm on flat+water+acid üòè 
---
The best part? I don‚Äôt even use the flat ground üòÇ
---
Or just kill the moles for them.
---
That's not what I mean, I thought you were saying in preparation you just got a bunch of the same card ready to scrap instead of having a bunch of level up points just there
---
I love that quest. Bit of bugspray and it's pure joy with a chance of a badge to boot.
---
New Vegas is where your outfit actually impacts how the NPCs perceive you and what faction you belong to, though.
---
It use to be there it‚Äôs gone now. Whoever was the team leader it showed there‚Äôs
---
Of course, don't know why I'm getting downvoted for speaking the truth. Haters gonna hate, I guess. The lies about this game have to stop.
---
Nah that‚Äôs mean plus who cares if it doesn‚Äôt get fixed. Free ammo never hurt anybody
---
Great advice. Thank you. I will definitely turn on the pacifist mode.
---
I‚Äôm going from 1 shot in a 360 right back to one shot so I‚Äôm not even mad and I have a bloodied unarmed build ü§£
---
The period and paragraphs are our friends.
---
Otherwise good on you.
---
Upvoted, no idea why you were downvoted either I came to say the same thing.
---
I have a one star Bloodied Fixer with Powerful Automatic Mod and it does more damage than a Bloodied Radium with Powerful Automatic Mod.  If you don't have a good Combat Rifle or Fixer, the Suppressor mod is kind of cool.  Quite a bit of recoil, though.
---
Yeah, we were running nukes on a server. We dropped on Earle. Went to next silo and before we got to the door, another dropped on Earl. After another Earle fight went to the last silo where someone was already there dropping a nuke on Earle. It‚Äôs still happening a lot but I assume those people aren‚Äôt on Reddit.
---
If only this damn gun had more customization
---
That's a sweet pull though!
---
E.T. might be able to help with that
---
*"pay to win loot box microtransaction"*
---
There is none of this
---
Thank you! This worked a lot!
---
Holy shit people can solo the sbq in 25 seconds, I have a blooded unarmed build and I can‚Äôt even solo her
---
You can also expand your definition of resource for even more options, I built my camp next to a dual Yao Guai spawn and I‚Äôm able to harvest both springs and acid every time I travel back to my camp, or when other people travel over to shop.
---
No, it does not need to function like gold bullion. All daily and total limits should be removed. Let me hoard my scrip and bullion as much as I want to.
---
It would be cool if he/she would tell bad mole miner jokes and laugh at his or her own punch line.
---
But for real f in the chat for the unarmed melees, they‚Äôre still fucking crazy and all but sometimes hitting more than once can mean the difference between life and death
---
Make sure your ticket is in purchase and billing and not "feedback". They only answer the former.
---
I don't care so much about the conversion rate, as bad as it is, I just wish it would tell me how much of the chosen ammo I have, and let me trade all, round it to the nearest whole ammo point if they have to and leave the remaining ammo in my inventory.
---
Thank you friend c:
---
I think that so long as you have the watch or the journal page, you can still complete the quest with Maggie.

---
This, all of the this. I've spent the weekend stocking up. 7k lead, 8k steel, 3k cloth and 2k acid. Oh, and better part of 500 violet flux. At 900 rounds per flux, FINALLY a prime minigun might be viable!
---
I killed my first scorched beast with a regular fixer
---
You could just drop the shit and play the game.
---
Lmao. That sounds awful! I guess I've been lucky . Tho all super mutants do look alike.
---
Sounds like some awesome stuff thank you!
---
As a bloodied commando operating at 40% for ACP with an asbestos chest I use maybe 2 on a bad run. Ditch the PA
---
You mean flares?
---
I believe it‚Äôs a flare. Settlers have it for gold bullion
---
Yup :) and np. The brotherhood outfit looks dope btw [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7SKLdJ6LSU&amp;t=13s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7SKLdJ6LSU&amp;t=13s)
---
Shoot me a private message with psn name if you dont want to put it here
---
I picked up a Bloodied Compound Bow today so I consider that a win.
---
Do you get your perk points back for scrapping them?
---
Somebody does not know weight management. With my high capacity backpack and Unyielding I can carry 435lbs. However I PvP, so I need to be able to restrict my carry weight to 265lbs because the ass/sent stops me having that str bonus and I drop the high capacity in favor of armor plated. I have learned to keep my carry weight to 260lbs total. Any more than that will just be junk and weapons/armor I will trade or scrip. If I‚Äôm on my melee character I carry less than 70lbs when I walk out of my camp.
---
I admitted to only use data that creates patterns. Vendors create exceptions, not patterns, and they can't be browsed efficiently. The tool encourages you to leave in-game trading and sell your wares via trading Discords/Facebooks/Reddits, because it's pretty much the only way to get the actual items value as defined by demand. Vendor hopping is a lottery. Tool tries to capture patterns, not measure luck.
---
Infiltrator rank 1 and ammo factory are my top picks. I use a FFR Handmade and that thing burns through ammo on events. Infiltrator for convenience.  
---
After that I don't know. Rad/fire/poison resist maybe to make myself for tanky (I'm a stealth commando, so no PA) or maybe Followthrough. Or go the safe route and add Luck, Intelligence or Strength as additional SPECIALs.
---
Sounds like a good idea, although to balance it I would suggest making the scrap box free and then adding this cabinet behind the pay wall.
---
It's a good way to waste some stimpaks while you hold 7k stimpaks. :D
---
There's no lootboxes, there never has been and there's no pay to win. YongYea isn't a trustworthy source, he's all about clickbait and negativity unless it's about Kojima.
---
I would like to have a loadout. When I am at camp to have loadout 1 change perks to repairs and building stuff, loadout 2 to change perks to bloddied loadout 3 heavy etc. When i am fighting and need to change from bloddied to heavy, the quest is gone by the time I finish.
---
This is also a point why I love this game. The community is overall one of the best I ever saw.
---
Well done mate.
---
A Grafton monster lightü•≥
---
Damn. I drop 20-40 a day if I play lol. Only carry 10. 7k is nuts.
---
have you tried taking video of the event and then screenshotting the video?
---
Sucks to hear you went thru similar stuff. It‚Äôs a shame, you‚Äôd think with a main storyline quest they would‚Äôve hopped on patching any errors like that right after release.  &gt;.&gt; Thank you though!
---
There is now ;) https://fed76.info/plans
---
Depends, I would have stick to the J/PA/+1S, I would entertain a swing speed weapon if I was playing a junkies melee build. However if you do  fight a lot of tougher enemies I could see the advantage in the swing speed.
---
I run a Bloodied build and I agree it needed a nerf, it's just too op.
---
Nothing ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù or ‚Äúmoral‚Äù about playing a game. If you want to give it a go, then go for it. If exploration is one of your biggest draws to Bethesda games, this one fill that need. 
---
The roleplaying has improved as well, and it‚Äôs dialogue system is probably the best they‚Äôve implemented. The story is interesting, and the game is actually quite fun. Is it perfect? No. Not even close, but fun can be had with this game. 
---
If you like New Vegas for its strong roleplaying elements and choices, then maybe skip this one and play The Outer Worlds if you haven‚Äôt already (also made by Obsidian, like New Vegas).
---
I should also add that performance on consoles is not the best, and PC can be hard to get running well depending on your specs. It‚Äôs surprisingly demanding, and questionably optimized.
---
They won‚Äôt change to a weekly as they need those daily logins for stats and to hope you‚Äôll give in and buy something. Though I agree it needs to change somehow.
---
We won't know until Tuesday
---
I can't wait for Legendary perks, have enough levels to max out 6 of the attribute boosting ones, an extra 30 points to slot in perks will be great.
---
Sounds like someone needs to respec their STR Special and add some weapon carry perks!
---
Red asylum dress is pretty rare
---
I‚Äôve seen it mentioned all over, so it high on my list.
---
Last time I ran Line in the Sand I ended up so overencumbered it took me _several minutes_ to walk to the caravan camp to scrap it it all
---
U say assault rifles need buffing but the chain goes assault-combat-handmade-fixer. If you buff the bottom entry level auto then u have to buff the rest of the chain. The reason it‚Äôs such low damage compared to a fixer is its tomy‚Äôs my first auto
---
Can confirm, as a bloodied stealth commando. The stupid falling embers were literally the only things that were killing me in this event. After equipping the asbestos chest, now I never die.
---
Yes, I found it! Thank you very much ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Yes!
---
That would be imbalanced stupidity. Of course they won‚Äôt work.
---
Of course this won‚Äôt stop people from downvoting a clearly common sense statement, but when they log in Tuesday they‚Äôll quickly forget their idiocy and claim, ‚ÄúI was right all along.‚Äù Even though they weren‚Äôt. Because that‚Äôs how this subreddit works..
---
I plan on keeping any non duplicate animated cards
---
I‚Äôm still new (lvl 10) but would love to make dweller friends. V01DL1NG is psn.
---
Ok thanks man
---
A problem that will be solved for me on Tuesday when I take infiltrator and scrap my lockpick and hacking cards.
---
AFAIK they haven‚Äôt said anything about it yet unfortunately
---
I hope to God it actually works as intended, it would be really nice
---
I add Fireproof to help with the environment.
---
It never ceases to amaze that low levels go running in there. It also ceases to amaze they're allowed in.
---
Im no elitist, and I hate ESO (years of playing), however their sister franchise has very clear level requirements on delves even after One Tamriel. So.......
---
Gotta wait 5 more to post on their as my account is new so I can't really do anything. Sadly
---
Honestly, if character transfer isn't a thing, I'm not gonna get it for you the ps5
---
It's ridiculous on a 40MM grenade launcher. One grenade there, and one grenade waaaay over there.
---
If it is low level armor and you put mods on it there is a chance that the condition bar went negative, which will then prevent it from breaking. For example, I have 3* level 1 leather armor that I made ultra light and shadowed. It is now unbreakable. I use it on my berserker. Since it is unbreakable it means I can also switch over to haznat suit for radiation zones
---
192 unused levels. And I think another 5 perk packs from the legendary run that I haven't opened yet. Tuesday perk scrapping will be as tedious as the day the ammo converter came out and I scrapped all my 38 to points and then points to 2mm for about an hour.
---
Go to the mine and do the event and finish the quest. You personally don't have to nuke the mine.
---
By then we‚Äôll be doing this shit in real life.
---
If you transfer to the same make of console (I.e xbx one x - series X) will it not transfer your save via some cloud thing?
---
Sony confirmed a long time ago ps4 games will be playable on ps5... any ps4 game you own you can just download and play as is on ps5 or even use the disc.
---
Not every game will be doing upgrades so fallout 76 for example will likely stay as is and just run on the new hardware. The jump from ps4 to ps5 is more of a upgrade then a jump like ps3 to ps4 was.
---
it was supposed to clear the way from the entrance but it was still blocked off i couldn‚Äôt get in
---
&gt; I admitted to only use data that creates patterns. Vendors create exceptions, not patterns, and they can't be browsed efficiently. 
---
Also you previously.
---
&gt;You are right that the tool \[Fed76\] doesn't output average sales price.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt;Yup, I admit we only used \[player\] vendor prices to learn cultural differences, not day to day pricing.

---
Like I said before, you openly admit to excluding the single most largest and most active portion of the market from your data - in game player vendors. Not a random sample. Not even a biased sample. Just excluded entirely.
---
And you want us to take Fed76's pricing seriously?
---
Like I said before, your response in that thread presents a better case than I ever could against taking Fed76's pricing seriously.
---
No. Not nerf Bloodied or Junkies. Bloodied already has a severe penalty for the extreme damage output it‚Äôs capable of. Junkies is about right, matter of fact a buff could well be in order.
---
I purchased the hard copy so i cant use it with game pass i dont think.
---
Ok thanks I realized that I had to successfully complete the event the hard way
---
Yes, you have to wait for the event A Colossal Problem to start for the rubble to clear.
---
Just wait for a nuke (server hopping helps) to launch on the mine and then join the event ASAP.
---
Railway rifles are ridiculous in VATS already. An auto railway rifle‚Äôs recoil is uncontrollable though, which is a shame. But considering how it a) shouldn‚Äôt even exist yet, and b) how it works, the recoil is understandable.
---
Except that new characters will instantly have access to the legendary perk slots of your highest character. So my level 9 character that I just made to play with my daughter will be able to get infiltrator instantly, saving me from ever spending points on those cards. Sure it'll all be rank 1 legendary cards, but it'll reduce the pain of the grind the second time around.
---
No I got the cloud thing fine, but it's character transfer, like legit moving ALL of your weapons, level, etc to another newer console
---
Actually we don't know for sure.  But they don't stack, so that hints that actually they are separate entries in the server database.  Maybe they arent, maybe they are stored as a single stack and the client unpacks that into multiple entries in the stash, but I doubt it.
---
You know if they added it both would be behind the paywall... but at the least we could hope the paywall doesn't get bigger
---
Damn that's going to suck bad if you have to restart
---
Th atom shop has some of those!
---
You have to join the event. You can‚Äôt walk into the mine.
---
It really will
---
Do you know if the old treasure hunter rewards will remain in the drop table?
---
thanks for the advice. this will definitely help
---
Now I know nothing about builds in this game so thank you very much for that tid bit of knowledge.
---
thanks
---
&gt; Basically, take the Fallout 76 or Fallout 4 maps and give various settlements as options to build up and the player would have to manage it like a city builder. Recruit people from the wasteland who pass through, send them to get supplies, defend the settlement from raiders, and turn a small shack into Diamond City.
---
Is this a description for a mobile game?
---
What about when there's nothing left to buy with caps?  I often actively server hop, switch teams and bounce around vendors looking for rare plans and apparel I dont have, come out empty handed, and stare at my disabled full vending machines while the 1400 daily caps in the NPC vendor are laughing at me.
---
good to know
---
Collect all the asylum outfits. I spent 150+ hours running into that fort and server hopping. I found every single one at least twice but no red. The yellow and forest i didn't find until 130+ hours and i found them within an hour of each other. Then i found another one of each in the next 10 hours. Had to trade for a red one eventually. Each run takes maybe 90 seconds. If you add a minute on you can check the top floor for a magazine, bobblehead and plan spawn.
---
Plus there's ballistic fibre there as well. I made an absolute fortune doing this.
---
They could just introduce a npc who buys the legendaries for scrip but at a big reduced price, let's you get rid of them all and shouldn't affect the market at all, let's face it you arent going to see everyone suddenly rocking the best gear with how rare it is to receive a good roll
---
I get my atoms but I never know when I‚Äôm getting it I just notice it‚Äôs gone up
---
I'll just stick on current Gen if it means I'm going to lose out on my 100+ hours aha
---
Flight recorder, scorched head in a jar, violin, robot chess pieces. Happy hunting
---
I only sneak up on the pricks who try and claim mine and then get all salty and say ‚ÄúItS fOr ThE cHaLlEnGe‚Äù so I destroy them some more and tell them to take one of usually twenty other unclaimed workshops. It‚Äôs *never* less than a dozen.
---
They will not. It would be an unbalanced advantage for NW.
---
Dude same, I'm not gonna restart all my progress and lose all my weapons
---
Yeah, no loot boxes. Otherwise, totally accurate.
---
Yikes, use some punctuation...
---
Or you just transfer your saved data over? So your character will transfer too
---
Thanks for the answer at least i hope they will cycle back at some point I hate paying over priced asking for "rare" event plans on markets rather just wait and earn them myself
---
I‚Äôve had over 50 before I hit level 50 since it got put on GamePass. After I got to level 100 people were far more reluctant to challenge me.
---
So what's happening with Larry treasure Hunter rewards?
---
No, if you‚Äôre going to whinge and bitch about PvP in a PvP area, you‚Äôre the asshole. You literally sign off your rights to not being killed.
---
Thinking Survival Shortcut and Infiltrator, for now, since I'll only have two legendary slots when they launch.
---
You...you know there are workbenches inside the Asylum, right? Top floors available via the elevator after you complete the quest to open the door to the BoS area.
---
Why would you need character transfer? You need a bethesda account to login to so that's where all the character/account data is kept. However, only for that platform. If you switch to a different platform, then it won't travel. Well, at least for now. Who knows what'll happen in future.
---
How do animated perk cards work? I feel like this might be the time to try and upgrade my none animated to animated. If I have one animated and upgrade it with a none animated does it become an upgrade animated??? :P 
---
Thanks for any help.
---
I turned the game off and lost the quest and thankfully the barrels too when I logged back in, but thanks anyway. Cost me a few stealthboys and some sanity for my troubles, but I think I'll avoid bothering if it pops up again.
---
I've only just started playing, level 11, what's a script and gold bullion?
---
I have one legendary 10mm but it's dogshit and it won't let me scrap it.
---
If that's an in-joke by one of the writers, that's awesome.
---
Also Bethesda, the radio DJ when it gives that speech to the listeners.
---
This is just not true at all
---
Idk man I just hope if Bethesda does do something for character transfer it isn't glitchy
---
copy/paste from dataminers:
---
*" You now can get all these from any size pail at different odds that increase with pail quality.  No more mounted heads, armor or weapon plans. You still get scrip/caps, ore, chems, and now contextual ammo All the previous unique plans/outfits to this event are still in that list, so insurgent, croc backpack, etc are still in. Also, these are new pails. They have the same names as the old ones, but are different ID's. So opening old pails will not give the new rewards. "*
---
That's where I put my tickets, they talk to me for the initial ticket. Then nothing. I've only made 3 tickets, keep in mind I don't want to be an ass and keep bugging them then after this third time. They just ignored me and took my Access and my money
---
What your xbox gt? I'll be on tomorrow and can give you a bunch!
---
Yeah it probably is, there‚Äôs also dialogue from Penelope about having trouble adding AI to the Motherlode - saying it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbuilt for it‚Äù, referencing how the Creation engine isn‚Äôt originally built for multiplayer lol.
---
Yeah I learned my lesson
---
You're OK up to 1870-1900 pounds of load, after 1900 you can't jog, and at ~ 1960ish pounds there's a cap and a snail laughs at your movement speed
---
Thank you so much for that.
---
And amazing news no more head plans.
---
Natasniceguyis my gamertag I literally just got offline myself and I really appreciate it just message me and let me know your the one gonna give me the ammo
---
That's semantics.
---
Iron Fist does have level 3, which is what I said.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Fist
---
What platform and what ammo jw
---
Oh ho that shit is even more unbalanced and full of griefers. And it really is pay to win unless you can grind the first 5 million for a Buzzard attack chopper and a casino to run the Casino Heist. And it took me about a month to do that because I was low level and I would regularly get swarmed by jets and tanks, as well as a fucking flying bike with homing missiles that almost never miss an air target and will not miss a ground target. After a fuck ton of grinding I can now get 80 million plus a day.
---
Not true you clearly don‚Äôt understand what op health was all about
---
Actually I wouldn't be surprised if specific items did this. Mainly apparels and such for easier pipboy management, but storage wise they should consolidate and I feel like it's just one more little thing they didn't get or fix lol
---
Haha that's amazing. Please tell us you actually have a bounty on you at the time? üòÖ
---
Insult bot is the best kind of griefer. 
---
I like the one where it thought of a really good insult but it wouldn't tell you because you're too dumb to get it.
---
Nope no bounty lol
---
B-but
---
That doesn't feel cool
---
I've been getting decent legendary spawns an drops tho lol
---
I was all hyped for bike launching and instead it's just another nuke.
---
Meh
---
Yes. I take Poseidon Energy plant and stick 30 or so ammo factories in there and I also take Sunshine Meadows Industrial for the Salisbury Steak.
---
The best thing you can do as a low level is taking as many workshops as you can and dont defend them, wait until they are overrun and then take em back. Do this with a melee weapon to save ammo. You will level up fast, get a lot of stimpacks, plans and ressources. The only downside is, that higher level players will come and kill you to get your scrap, so always empty your junk before fast travelling to your workshops and try to stay hidden in your workshops.
---
If you get killed by another player in your workshop, simply accept it and take the workshop back after your killer leaves, he never wants the workshop, he only wants to kill you.
---
While youre at it, build water purifiers in the workshops and sell the water to vendor bots. Easy money.
---
What are the rarest asylum outfits?
---
Give it time, try traveling other places and going back, or retracing the sloth‚Äôs path, or jumping to a private server - sometimes it takes a moment for them to show up
---
Oh yeah they *should*.  I don't trust them to tie their own shoelaces though.
---
3 nukes, 5 events, 32 treasure notes, minimum 3x 3* legendaries. I hope they never fix this, it's the very definition of fun. Go for ACP first, as it only has a 5 minutes join window. The queen flies around the full 30 minutes can be killed at any time in those 30 minutes.
---
Agreeeeed lol
---
Especially the arrogant level 500+ cunts in Protocoled Excavator power armor thinking they‚Äôre so hard they can just gank you because you‚Äôre a tenth of their level. They usually have some *very* nice loot.
---
Imagine making a Football game and two years later making it ban able to sack the QB.
---
So I can nuke that area and I will have everything to make cobalt flux in one nuke you say?
---
We have Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas on the Xbox One thru backwards compatibility. The cloud save games can transfer over on that, although I traded in the 360 so haven't moved a save game back over the other way. I assume we could do it backwards if needed tho. 
---
If we had to buy a new next gen version of the game to play it there could possibly be an issue. In that case I wouldn't pre-order and wait to see if someone else tries and fails first before dropping that kind of money on something we already have.
---
What if the keys had sections (quest, unknown, never used, used and just what on in the item description.) 
---
On top of all this though, I'd really like a search feature for my items sometimes lol
---
People whinging and bitching about PvP in a *post apocalyptic wasteland* where there *are no societal standards* really grates my nerves. If someone felt like shooting you in the head to steal your shit in real life, it will happen.
---
Memor-Eaze Coffee Cup?
---
Bloodied's severe penalty is easily countered, and it's the issue that bloodied builds dominate most content to the point other players either don't have time to join an event or don't have a chance to even tag. I refuse to discuss this, I have an incredibly strong opinion on that.
---
No ammo needed, just Chinese stealth suit and lockpick+hacker lvl 3. Control room might take a while if you just sit in the corner but it does save ammo.
---
What are daily ops?
---
Okay I‚Äôll give that a try. Thanks. I was surprised when I actually tamed the sloth. Bc that‚Äôs also the first time I‚Äôve seen a megasloth since I‚Äôve had the game.
---
[Fallout 76: Inside the vault ‚Äì Daily ops preview](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview)
---
I think you are likely correct. They even have higher quality gear on, rather than the usual rags.
---
You could have just joined that server again via the social tab, it would show all recent players
---
Any new prime plans don't include the plan for ammo if an existing plan already had it
---
The only time I've been inside the Asylum was for the original quest line a year ago, and the only way to reach the workbenches then was to slog through the entire facility. Had no idea there was now a shortcut lolo
---
I will still die significantly faster than a full health build, and nothing you can say will go against my experiences with a fully optimised Bloodied PvP build, every damage reduction perk in the book.
---
It‚Äôs much more. This sub is gonna freak when they are doing 14 dmg to the sbq with builds that previously did triple digits.
---
Bethesda hasn‚Äôt thought this trough at all. And this sub is cheering it.
---
SAR is one of the worst weapons in the game but hey if it's better than what you got, go for it. I wouldn't respec into pistols for this. Personally, I'd scrip it.
---
I remember that from back when I was bought 76 the Christmas it came out. Played a while, got bored and left the game for nearly 18 months. Now that I've decided to give it another go in the last couple weeks with a friend I'm not seeing them either. It was probably patched out to stop us rinsing quests for extra XP and rewards.
---
Completed quests are at the bottom of the pipboy quest pages, so you'll probably have to ask what quest they're doing and look back through the list for quest steps.
---
I let him walk away everytime cause I'm a big Vault Boy... Except when he insulted my CAMP and ate about 100 5mm.
---
Try it with VATS
---
Yep have spent the last week planning out two perk card decks. One for normal play and another for Daily Ops.
---
Don't spam buy from her. Odds are weighted based on server start time and the time you joined the server.
---
Im telling you man Junkies is the rarest prefix, with bloodied being a very close second.
---
You are a responder, maggot! Reporting is a joke, you hear me commie?
---
You don't need stealth to do these. Is your Stealth perk card useless? Yes, it's always been useless but now it really is. Ditch it for Adrenaline.
---
Sneaking would run up the clock anyways, just sprint past the ones you don't need to kill.
---
I've found, carrying a little of everything will help with traffic. There are certain things that sell better, like acid, lead, adhesive, etc., but you never know what people are looking for. I try to keep a lot of ammo stocked, but then people wipe you out, and there's none left for anyone else; so don't sell all your ammo at once. There are certain legendary prefixes that people covet more than others, in spite of the impending nerf. Chems are often overlooked: Junkies need chems, but to non-junkies, they waste space. Excess Stimpaks (especially if you're in a low level area) purified water, alcohol, and non perishable (preferably non-irradiated) food stuffs. Keep a few grenades for good measure, and plans, as well as maps.
---
This general store strategy is what has worked best for me. Also, my location is in a well traveled area.
---
Isnt that one of their voice lines? Lol
---
We can only hope this game gets an overhaul at some point.
---
I used 3200 scrip in total and i think the best weapon i got was AA33Agi Fixer.. 0 Junkies, 0 Bloodied.
---
Idk how you have budget to even put down a turret man....
---
Pc?
---
Open ini file and add line:
---
bShowMarkers = 1
---
I'm looking forward to not being able to move for several days of the new patch because I'm overloaded with purveyor weapons.
---
Just duel weild them! Get all the effects!
---
Were not on PTS atleast. But who knows what happens tomorrow.
---
No, I'm in discord or in a party with my friends....
---
Energy resist penetration still bug as of 9/8/20 patch. All non legacy/magic energy weapons are trash
---
He's literally running to your camp in real time. 
---
You can 'escort' him if you want but it's likely to get it killed. 
---
Grats on your Sloth! I've had a level 16 stunted Yao for over 2 months now. Was just the first tamable I found and even though I had my heart set on an Albino Deathclaw, the fact that Yogi has survived for so long has me keeping him around.
---
\*mumble\* call me a commie \*mumble\* report you too \*mumble\*
---
Scrip weapon i'm afraid
---
99.9999% of those drop are from the Earle event?
---
No worries thanks
---
Yep
---
They are all goo
---
Thanks
---
YOU BETTER RUN YOU COMMIE LOVING BASTARD!
---
Also, press Q until you sort by weight and sell the heaviest ones first. Ten 1* knives are lighter than one 3* Sledgehammer
---
Problem is he still hasn‚Äôt made it to my camp. I jumped around. To different places. Went to private server. Retraced his steps. And he still ain‚Äôt came. So guessing  he got killed before getting here. I‚Äôve been waiting for 2 hours real time.
---
They can't. 
---
The reason we have so many bugs is because of how convoluted and messy the base code is to begin with. Every time they fix one they create 2 more.
---
Assuming the game will play on the next console (it should) then of course your account will transfer as it's no different than transferring within the same console... The real question is will the experience be upgraded, and if so will we have to pay extra for that? Give me 4k graphics and no lag and I'll buy a PS5 on launch, if it just plays the same then I'm good with a PS4 for another year at least.
---
Yea it shouldn't take 2 hours. 
---
I'm not sure if leaving the server before they arrive changes anything. Pretty sure the moment you send them to camp they get physically leashed to your CAMP module. 
---
I'd wait a day or 2 to see if he appears before taming a new one though.
---
Yeah, some MMO's (at least MapleStory) has invisible options for all gear as a microtransaction
---
Alright. Will do. This sucks lol
---
How about reopening vault 76 and having it act as a bank just like in world of warcraft. You could rent space with bottle caps.
---
2h skins can easily be applicable on all 2h weapons but Beth so Dumb. Ez sales missed cuz I don't have BSSS Grognak axe
---
Dude chinese is my first language and I don‚Äôt understand a word they say. It‚Äôs amazing how people figure out.
---
- Armor
---
- Weapon
---
- - Ranged
---
- - Melee
---
I prefer the one that has the gold leaf pattern on it. The wood inlay iirc.
---
You're right. 
---
I must have known it opened me up to PVP, because I was twitchy and suspicious of the high level player when he arrived. But I was as challenging as a molerat and didn't expect players 100's of levels higher would waste their time murdering me for two boxes of Abraxo.
---
But, nevermind, it taught me not to fear claiming a workshop and that the strongest in game friendships may start with you pointing weapons at each other.
---
Balancing the enemies to your level is fine, but nerfing the weapons, builds and how they work at the same time is not a good thing. Making enemies harder and keeping my build and weapons the same would of been acceptable. As the game is now it's nothing but a grind fest. Shooting more, repairing more, gather more materials to repair more and make more ammo while simultaneously maxing out enemy levels across the map is all adding to that grind fest. If you like that Bethesda once again adds more to the game to make it nothing but a grind fest and think that's what equals fun, then I actually think there's something wrong with you. Go try an actual well made game with an engaging story for a week or two and see if you even miss FO76. I've been playing daily since day one and I don't miss it in the slightest.
---
I did about 3000 scrip. BFFR...... 10mm.
---
Although I now have a Vampires Ultracite Gatling Laser on all 5 of my characters.
---
So, anyone else overencumbered AF? üòÄ
---
By mentioning level I meant like, it'd be nice to be somewhere where new players are likely to go so my free stuff would be more helpful. One Wasteland may make it more viable to run up to the mire, but there's still going to be less level 1-10 players over there yknow?
---
Also dang I didnt even realize laser rifles gave plastic, that does open up some options.
---
Don't spam buy next time my guy. Change servers frequently
---
I just built a covenant style camp last night with the junk walls enclosing a group of pre existing houses and a road running through the middle and wished I had a junk gate. 
---
I ended up using garage doors after sinking foundations so they were barely visible, snapping wood half walls to the top of the garage door and placing junk walls against the sides of the garage door to hide the ugly corrugated steel.
---
Looks decent but I‚Äôd rather use one workshop item than like 7 for each gate.
---
Erectus.
---
Thanks for these
---
Could someone tell a non english native what the sympto-matic &amp; super reactor are ?
---
Yeah that too, so you wanna sell by weight and value
---
Ikr, i just spend 500 scrip on those legendary modules
---
Any Vanguard Raider? I just can‚Äôt seem to get my hands on one. Don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs heavy, sturdy or standard. Would just like a piece. Would like to upgrade my left arm also.
---
It gets annoying if the fucker chases you round the map.
---
Does this mean the whistle is added to the legendary loot pool? I wonder how that would translate effects wise, seeing as it's already a guaranteed roll on effects.
---
Combo of only being level 50, a complete noob with no build as of yet and having literally just read what the legendary perks are going to be,  I have no idea! However, ammo factory looks good to me as first thoughts. How exciting! :D
---
Something to cure diseases=, symptomatic
---
Super reactor=power source
---
Same thing for ammo. Give us an ammo container to store stuff in.
---
I've seen the screen shots of the major damage loss my weapons will have which includeds unarmed, semi auto rifles and shotguns. All of those weapons are instigating and everything about them from the weapons themselves, the type of weapons and their attributes are getting nerfed hard. I'm expecting to go into the game and having to shoot and melee enemies six to ten more times than normal from everything I've seen posted on the PTS. I've seen people posting how they have to deal several sneak head shots to a single enemy where they used to be able to only need one. What's the point of a sniper or sneak build now? From what I've read commando or heavy gunner is the only way to stay proficient which is the exact opposite of my play style. It's fine though because I really don't miss the game at all at the moment. I've been playing well made games with engaging stories which I don't get with FO76.
---
The prize finds me too often. I miss the insult bot!
---
Depends, just like in real life everyone needs toilet paper and some people drive Ferrari‚Äôs . Players unintentionally mimic real life retail businesses some stack it high and sell it cheap just to have a clear out (like car boot sales) whilst others are a little overpriced  for that thing you‚Äôve just run out of and you can‚Äôt be bothered shopping around to get it cheaper ( like corner shops ) , some are extortionate but you don‚Äôt really have much choice you need that disease cure or stim packs ( like service stations) and some vendors sell top top quality desirable expensive items only ( like Harrods ) , because there‚Äôs always affluent people who don‚Äôt mind splashing the cash
---
Commenting in the hopes that someone explains exactly what effects are needed to be magic! I got one that could be the other day and can‚Äôt work it out
---
Thank you very much sir :)
---
I thought cap was +1500 so reliant on your carrying?
---
Red. Worth whatever people want to trade for it. Seen it go for 150k in trade before 
---
Forest. 25k
---
Yellow 15k.
---
pink 10k
---
Blue 5k
---
Green 4-5k
---
Brown 1k.
---
Yeah it should only take 30 minutes or so, best of luck to you!
---
well, if it's a duped weapon, you can be flagged now. careful with that.
---
Besides I hope those weapon will be deleted in the future.
---
I've taken to using a mining helmet for a better torch. Looks like crap, but it's so much better than the green area glow from the pipboy and it's forward facing.
---
Ahhhh... Corporate greed in action! How lovely. It‚Äôs only the little people that suffer you know. A corporation always gets off Scot free, or at least close to it.
---
Holy shit really?
---
Legendary scrip machines are found at train stations, you can exchange unwanted items for a currency you can then spend at the rusty pick in the Ash heap. Gold bullion will become clear once you get to finishing the wastelanders quest lines.
---
Really. Forest can be traded for something nice. Hats aren't worth anything though.
---
I think sympto-matic is a machine that cures all your diseases (not 100% sure on that, but remember reading something like that from somewhere) and no idea what super reactor is, but guessing a power generator (i remember seeing pictures somewhere about the same kinda Vault generator you see in Fallout 4 vaults, huge dome like thingy).
---
I play siege since release.
---
Even animals are part of the problem.   I saw a rabbit open my fireplace door.
---
Ooo they should bring back the BB gun
---
The first 20 I did over 5 or 6 servers (Junkies during this) on the first day and then next 20 was over the next 4 days (Bloodied today)
---
I have no info on that, but the Plan: The Gutter (also a pre-rolled legendary originally from questline) made you able to craft it using legendary scrip. At the time i was testing it on PTS it didn't roll with extra effects, and i don't know if that is how it is meant to be or not, or if they made changes to it recently.
---
You and me both lmao. That doesn‚Äôt change that you clearly don‚Äôt understand what op health was all about
---
Would be a cool plan to get from new Christmas presents if they do Christmas scorched again.
---
I want one that‚Äôs like a laser-light show
---
Oh man. I'd love to have the Sympto-matic. My camp is set up as a doctor's surgery and it would fit right in.
---
I had to buy 1st just so I had room in my Stash which is now full lol 
---
I reckon I have 2000 scrip in my stash that I'll slowly have to start going through.
---
Yes you just need to mod it so it has a fire rate over 200.
---
I'm on PS4. It seems game pass brought a bunch of shitty trolls to you guys.
---
And on a side note - vending machines are awesome, do you old school players remember how much of a pain in the ar@e player to player trading was before them, sending you a little love here bethesda for a change üëè‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Ok this should be magic. Check the videos of angry turtle on it. Ballistic guns with a firerate near or over 200 with the main effect Instigating, junkies, medics or stalker OR 33%vats, bash dmg or limb dmg as second effect should be magic.
---
I keep getting the prizebot
---
Every cunt has a legacy or at least explosive weapon nowadays. Blow it out of the water!
---
The Gutter plan makes sense, but I assumed it would roll out like the Fixer and make for 4 effect legendaries when I saw it was releasing for other PTS players. 
---
I'll be interested to see if the WitD is a forerunner to releasing all survival weapons as plans. If that's the case, that's a significant market being devalued to nothing. Right now, Unstoppable Monsters are worth a pretty penny, and it helps that they're legacy. But if they can be crafted? They won't be worth anything much more then the modules they need.
---
And new bait. Everyone who killed me has been hunted down and utterly destroyed, except one. I think he‚Äôs running ass/sent but now I also have ass/sent combat armor I too can turtle tank. We‚Äôll see who has the skill.
---
A super reactor is a reactor that powers vaults. It's a full scale nuclear reactor. You see them in the nuke silos when you gotta repair the pipes. The big metal balls in the floor.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault\_Star\_super-reactor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_Star_super-reactor)
---
Yep, the super reactor is just a generator. Gives 100 power, like the fusion core.
---
Oh, the sweet sweet taste of virtual mesothelioma
---
bUt MuH bAlAnCe!
---
They don't fix the problems people complain about here though.
---
Or that Illusive middle finger emote..
---
Yes, that is a "magic" minigun when you mod it with accelerated barrel (for 200+ firerate).
---
I try to have a mix of high value/high demand items.
---
I have 3 event spawn points I server hop to farm.
---
From one I get plans for the Halloween Witch costume and the Halloween Skeleton costume. They sell quick for upwards of 2000 caps. 
---
From another I get recipes for Stimpaks and Radaway. They sell quick if priced reasonably. This vendor has plans for nearly all chems but I've found only the two mentioned sale reliably. 
---
From the other I get rare outfits like the Hunters Long coat and 'Clean' stuff. The time involved in farming these in considerable however and I wouldn't bother if I didn't have ample time to kill daily while not actually being able to 'play'. 
---
I also keep stocked with a ton of shotgun shells for 1 cap. They sell quick and usually in bulk quantities. So quick I was debating crafting them specifically to sale but I scavenge so many already and I'm close to Cap limit so never got around to it.
---
Yes it actually has 2 magic effects, bash and Junkies. As long as the fire rate is over 200. Word is they won't be Magic when One Wasteland drops, but that is just a rumour.
---
Maybe if you craft it you always get the regular version, but you can get legendary versions from the purveyor? Just like the Fixer.
---
I'm not sure neither. I didn't get the plan in the PTS, so couldn't test it.
---
Nice. I hate PvP but I do like wiping out trolls.
---
That would truly fit right in then :) Also, saves us the trouble of fast traveling to the Whitespring golf club and running to the sulphur water fountain everytime we get diseased.
---
‚ÄúJust drop your items it‚Äôs your fault your stash is full‚Äù meanwhile bos wants 250m glass. Like ok they can hoard but I can‚Äôt?
---
its a prewar item i¬¥d say, from a time where the Zetans would only encounter lightly or non armored opponents on earth. after the nukes and FEV most enemies are usually heavily armored or mutated beasts with close to supernatural resistances. ( on the other hand, regarding the zetans appeareances throughout all FO-titles.... Beth just botched this item as many others in the game... )
---
Except Medics does not count, AT redacted that at some point.
---
I like PvP. I will fight all and any people who decide they want to fight me, but there‚Äôs this one dude I physically cannot best. My friend runs a JE gat plas and PA, but I have no idea how the hell he tanks a full magazine from my BE laser when any other dude in PA I fight only takes 1 shot, rarely two.
---
ammo factory and specials i think. the option to  use more normal perks seems better than the chance of occasional exploding mobs...
---
Sweet, added the accelerated barrel which gave it 209 RoF :)
---
Because it was literally the best weapon in Fallout 3, and it‚Äôs one of the best in Fallout 4. Can‚Äôt have that in 76, now can we? That would be too overpowered.
---
I started the bloodied build some weeks ago just to try the stupid OPness before it get nerfed. Yes it needs a nerf.
---
I will keep the bloodied because it reminds me of glass cannons on Dark Souls II and III.
---
Definitely reminds me of my first scorchbeast encounter! I still have the photo as one of my loading screens, silly ole me with a lv 30 excavator armour and bog standard gauss rifle :)
---
Responder fireman outfit, camo jumpsuit, white powder jumpsuit, whitespring jumpsuit, traveling leather coat, scout masks and the plans for BOS power armor paints.
---
On behalf of Bethesda Austin studios, I regret to inform you we will not be making any further adjustments post rebalancing. While some people will lose upwards of 80% damage we feel this is completely necessary to force team play because nobody will be able to take on a level 100 radroach by themselves. It will also make PvP impossible because a Quantum spammer will be able to withstand the ridiculously small damage capable of being done. We do ~~not~~ sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused.
---
Give me the option to tell merchants to never come cause they never have any good and they just walk all over my house like they own the place and it pisses me off I wish I could kill them
---
Yes if that freezing triggers with some certainty,this weapon would be a top tier 2 hand.
---
I think items are supposed to be have a build cost based in the complexity of the 3D model (polygons, triangles, vertices whatever), but I also don't think they check every object, and just just guess sometimes. It's all supposed to be based on how much of a load is placed on your graphics card. And just because you might have a better GPU (or better console), the person visiting your camp, may have something barely able to run the game. Bethesda has to take this all in to consideration when determining camp budget and build cost.
---
It‚Äôs specifically against melee. I had a build hitting a turret for 15k+ and it would still only take a tenth of a turret‚Äôs health. One shot from a BE lever action (no rifleman or demo expert perks) and it would die.
---
Do you earn Treasury Notes every time, or it it just a chance of earning some?
---
it's about 60 days long if you do it every day
---
80% damage reduction. Are u sure about that. Sounds a lot
---
Man i barely got any luck in finding weapons so far in this game but this sale turned it over.
---
I got two magic shotguns, one of them quad.
---
A bloodied handmade, anti armor handmade, aae Combat shotgun, Aa Combat shotgun, berserkers explosive 90rdw gatling gun, vampiric explosive gatling gun, junkies limb damage 90rdw gatling laser, quad 33 Combat rifle, and some more. I Was like wtf.
---
But yeh thats my experience üòÇ
---
I too, want a Hitler outfit.
---
Which is dumb because the ammo is in only like one spot and a pain to get to respawn since you have to pick up like 120 more times (I don't know the actual number)
---
Honestly if you just look up 50s on Spotify there‚Äôs a decent bit of playlist to pick from I love doing this while playing so I don‚Äôt have to listen to the same 40 mins of music Bethesda has
---
I have a 1star junkies mini with accelerated barrel. That‚Äôs magic so I‚Äôm going to say yours is as well
---
Your title reminds me of those memes.  
---
"Help i accidentally built a ikea shelf again!"
---
Bloody hell, could have shared your luck with the rest of us hahaha
---
I had a Pink in my vendor for 5000 caps as I didn't feel like bothering with trading for more. 
---
The level 336 that bought it actually made a point of tracking me down to thank me and offer another 5000 caps for finally completing his collection. 
---
I turned him down as I was close to max. Later saw him bouncing around at meat week wearing it! I grin whenever that load screen image comes up now.
---
Lol
---
Credits also goes to xEdit developpers.
---
Just FYI, datamining consist to open the esm in xEdit, and open a record to see what's in it. Everyone can do this.
---
And you can join a world via a specific players, or you have to request a team?
---
Haha i would rather take the Main prize in lottery instead of having my luck burned here, but ye i cant complain üòÇ
---
I think that's where my camp actually is!
---
Just east of that scratch built bunker under the pylon?
---
I just want demolition expert reverted. My Demoman has not been the same since.
---
Me too. What‚Äôs magic guns?
---
255 then server hop
---
The whole thing is basically a study in how not to design events. It was rarely done before the season pass because it required both coordination among players for getting the ore collected while defending the scavengers, and very high DPS builds to have a chance at a successfull defence in the first place.
---
Along comes season 1 with its emphasis on XP gain and a dupe wave that made extremely high DPS weapons rather more widely available, and suddenly everyone is doing the event, but no-one but a few players here and there cares about a successfull finish because all everyone does - and understandably so - is farm XP and legendaries.
---
So unless and until Bethesda fixes the huge gap in loot and XP between collecting ore and farming ghouls, the event will continue to be a broken mess.
---
the change of damage calculation doesn't really change the way you make your build, nor the meta hierarchy, so this would be cool, maybe, but mostly pointless.
---
True, but imagine what you could trade for now
---
I think what he means is, unless weapons are more balanced there is no real incentive to choose lesser weapons. 
---
is definitely a problem esp. with the upcoming nerf and how weapons like pistols are very underwhelming.
---
I had a bloodied build take a full magazine from my quad Gamma gun. I sometimes wonder if there are hacks on console.
---
Can‚Äôt be done. There‚Äôs a sleeper bonus to rad res under the hood of all power armor. You can‚Äôt reach it.
---
Where did you find your sloth? I've been trying to tame one for a month or so! Had kinda given up.
---
Savage roast. Insult rated 13 out of 10. Would make me cry.
---
255? Cool never really knew the number. I use to farm unique nukas from the frat house. Get them collect a bunch of junk not in crates and hop server. Nuka Dark with party boy and cola nut is freaking great.
---
If you spawn at Harper ferry and follow the road south. You come to a small under pass. With a train cart above it. Like a small bridge. That‚Äôs where it spawns. You‚Äôve gone to far if you made to the rocket station. There‚Äôs also another location I‚Äôve seen one. If you travel to moss town and go south west there is a brown down car and there is a sloth there too.
---
You can literally just view them on Xbox and join their game directly if they appear online
---
I have also stated reasons why the particular market you're fixated about is source of exceptions, not patterns. If the vending model changed to global auction house system, NONE of what is the current Player Vending nature would remain. It would stop being luck-and-location based lottery, and would became a nice representation of actual trends in player demands. As it is now, its luck-and-location based lottery. Great source of material to write a PhD, nothing that could be realistically gauged in automated fashion.
---
PvP in adventure mode should just be abolished honestly, except for maybe mutual duels. Even the bounty system is pretty broken.  Workshops are functionally dumb, and it'd be better if they were turned into session-wide activities or events that allow people to take advantage of their production capabilities if they contribute.
---
It would be a lot more interesting than just having it be these half-assed PvP zones where people are more interested in blindsiding you you by claiming them under your nose, or just waiting to ambush you on the popular ones the moment you claim.  It's just really annoying that the common procedure for workshops if you don't have any interest in fighting is to avoid them, or just be in sneak mode 24/7 so you can also avoid people trying to be clever with the claim mechanics while in the zone.
---
Yep, I server hopped and hit that spawn and the North East pond spawn at least 100 times, and didn't get a sloth once, haha.
---
I do wish you could get the regular spawns tamed like at Treetops.
---
Yes after the last Mumbels sale I was stuck at the rusty pic for a week logging in and just scrapping 3 legendaries a day. This time around I only get 3 legendaries a day so I can at least scrap them if they are on good. Scrip is already a voucher. Please no more currencies/vouchers it already feels way to much like a mobile game. We just need higher script limits, or a weekly instead of a daily limit.
---
with an accelerating barrel on it , it will be magic.  Note any minigun even a plain non-legendary one will be magic if you have a piece of armor with the 15% less damage while blocking effect and put an accelerated barrel on it. All guns with a fire rate of 200 or over are magic this way.  without the 15% blocking effect or in power armor the gun must have 200 fire rate (two shot double the fire rate for this) Junkies, instigating or stalkers, v33 , bash40, +50 limb will make a gun magic all the time without the armor effect.

Well it is the apocalypse so it would kind of make sense to want a lot of supplies lmao
---
I got a decent dead Mia screenshot but I am at work right now. If you want it, pm me a mail adress and I can send it later if you like.
---
Literature says yes, it is.
---
Put an accelerated barrel on it and try it on a Mirelurk Queen. You'll find out soon enough.
---
You should add the percentages:
---
If you are ***under Level 50, you will not get any of the new stuff***. You will only get Plans for base game weapons, armor (both Normal and Power Armor), and the plans you would receive from Workshop claiming/defending.
---
If you **are Level 50 or above**, the odds of receiving an item are first determined by the Rank you finish the Daily Ops:
---
* Initiate: 5% chance to get one of the new plans.
---
* Paladin: 10% chance.
---
* Elder: 80% chance.
---
Then, the rewards are split into "Uncommon" and "Rare," where you are more likely to gain an Uncommon reward:
---
**60% Chance to get one of the following "Uncommon" plans:**
---
* Plan: Caged Bulb Lights
---
* Plan: Burrows Signs
---
* Plan: Valley Galleria Signs
---
* Plan: Vault 94 Jumpsuit
---
* Plan: Vault 94 Stash Box
---
**40% Chance to get one of the following "Rare" plans:**
---
* Plan: Solar Panels
---
* Plan: Sympto-Matic
---
* Plan: Super Reactor
---
* Recipe: Liquid Courage
---
* Plan: War Glaive
---
* Plan: The Gutter
---
* Plan: Whistle in the Dark
---
* Brotherhood Special Ops Suit
---
* Brotherhood Special Ops Mask
---
Like the OP, I didn't find any of this, credit goes to all the dataminers.
---
Any news if those are gonna be tradeable? My main is probs gonna get all of them eventually, but half of those would be more useful on my alt characters.
---
It's really not that hard, if the gun has a magic effect and can hit an effective RoF of 200+ it's magic 
---
Shotguns don't need rate of fire to work
---
I was using this and the cost of things are truly a shot in the dark. In no way should a bobblehead on display cost the same a full fledged couch.
---
No lol they need to deal with this issue, changing carry weight and perks when you have a lot of legendaries doesn't make a difference
---
My point is I don‚Äôt know what the magic effects are, or did you skip over that part in your rush to be condescending?
---
If I can do everything sans nuke zone I'll be happy
---
Wait what?
---
Editing the post, thx. Never seen these numbers before.
---
You aim mate! I agree for the most part as I also started to like NW more.
---
But work on your aim ehehe
---
Yeah i did do this, but i was hoping someone had maybe made a fallout specific station like euro truck simulator has.
---
And a lot of those 50s songs on spotify don't actually fit with the game. Cant believe they didn't keep "end of the world" by Skeeter Davis
---
Honestly they're better than I was expecting, so it's nice.
---
I‚Äôm not even joking. The way damage is now calculated makes it so instead of multiplicative damage increase its additive. 
---
So let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm dealing 50 base damage with my handmade. If it‚Äôs Bloodied, I can get an 80% increase in damage, making it 90. If I have Adrenal Reaction, I am get another 50% damage increase in top of my Bloodied, so 90 + 50% makes 135. Now let‚Äôs add on my 60% commando perk damage. 135 + 60% is 216. Nerd Rage will add on another 20% to that, so I do 260 damage (rounded up to the next whole number.)
---
Let‚Äôs do that again, but with an additive damage increase instead. My handmade does 50 damage by itself. Bloodied adds 80%. So that‚Äôs 90 damage, like before. But this is where it‚Äôs different. Adrenal Reaction won‚Äôt multiply the 90 damage by 1.5, just the damage from the handmade. So 90 + 25 is 105. So far that doesn‚Äôt look too bad, but that‚Äôs already just under a 25% decrease. Anyway, I digress. I get another 60% of 50 meaning I add 30 to 105 which gives me 135, compared to my 216 from before. Then we factor in my Nerd Rage, and add 10 (20% of 50) giving me 145 compared to my 260 as previous, which is an approximately 55% decrease in my damage. I‚Äôm not even taking into account explosive damage on explosive weapons with demolition expert, neither am I taking into account Adrenaline, Better Criticals, or other damage increasing perks. Now imagine that on a Bloodied Melee build, where the base damage on a weapons might be 150 or so, while it‚Äôs capable, with perks, armor  and aid, of doing 30k+ damage.
---
Solar panels eh..... Might suit my off the grid build.
---
This shit better be tradeable. As a stealth build I kinda got fucked a bit and have to do a baby respec to even be able to run these, let alone hit Max ranks.
---
Not sure why we saw the need to ostracise a whole build type but hey...
---
No sir. Nuka Grape is a wonderful thing.
---
That may be so, but i didn't receive the information from xEdit developers, so can't really credit them. Or by your logic should i credit Bethesda for making the game in the first place? Or creators of different gaming platforms that gave us the tool to play the game?
---
I know. Multitasking....
---
Instigating, Junkies, 33 VATS, Limb damage, Bash damage on guns with 150+ effective firerate. They work most reliably on Miniguns and LMGs given that your client framerate is also high enough, the server is somewhat laggy and you can hit the same spot without missing or hitting someplace else on the same target. 
---
You can get the effect with 50 cals if they are also two shot or explosive that double the hit-rate. Gauss Minis have built-in explosive effect so you'd need any of the above effects only.
---
Nothing to consider here.
---
character is tied to your account which is tied to your psn/xb profile/account.
---
as long as same profile there will be no issues.
---
Thanks so much, would an instigating explosive .50 cal count? the fire rate is under 100 though.
---
Your weapon needs to have **one** of the following effects: (OP's weapon has two of these, but the effects don't stack to give you "double magic" or anything like that).
---
* Instigating
---
* Junkie's
---
* Stalker's
---
* VATS hit chance
---
* Limb damage
---
* Bash damage
---
**OR:**
---
You can forgo all of the above, and just wear a piece of magic armor instead. Specifically "Reduce damage by blocking 15%". But whichever option you choose, the below conditions also must be met:
---
**For shotguns:** Magic only works in VATS.  
---
**For any other weapon:** Magic only works if ROF is 200+ or very close to it. (eg: gatling lasers can be magic, despite having a ROF of only 182)
---
3 x3 star weapons. 2 x 2 star weapons. = 150. Its on autopilot now.
---
Then just watch one of the hundreds of YouTube videos about it
---
Amazing thanks, slowly getting my head around it!! Would an instigating explosive .50 cal be classed as magic?
---
Boy if I had enough time to waste watching some shitty YouTuber, I‚Äôd be a happy woman
---
Oh then yeah I think you have to buy the plans, in the world, for those.
---
Crazy smh. Thanks for the info!
---
That's the thing, after grinding for all that gold, that shit should be the best right?! I get the legendary perks but the base armor should just rock hard and it doesn't. I'm tired of lying to myself as I keep dying over and over again while wear this shit.
---
Stealth perk card?
---
Launched my first at level 352 mate, so you're no alone üòÅ Well done anyway..feels great eh üëç
---
They take the discarded legendary items out of the machines at the stations to "drop" for you again later on down the line! Devious *rats!*
---
Sorry to ask a million questions, so it only needs one of the effects? So would a junkies shotgun count too?
---
Oh he‚Äôll yeah man I def use CRIT cards in luck! I have luck on 15! I was thinking about putting the receiver that gives you extra CRIT shot damage since I use CRIT cards! And I‚Äôll hit you up bro!
---
Stay affordable, stay reputable, and stay in one place. 
---
I have 3-5 vendor machines that are always full, bustling and I feel like I have infinite caps. Some tips.
---
Choose a central location, or at least somewhere people pass by a lot. You want people to see you on the map. My main is right next Mothman Lighthouse. My alt is in the Cranberry Bog. There's a staggering difference in trade between them.
---
Have at least 3 vendors. Ammo and Aid are your staples.
---
On your ammo vendor, sell all types of ammo on your vendor and unless it's something special, keep all ammo at 1 cap. I'm not alone when I say, if I open a vendor and see arrows, bolts and fusion cells for 2 caps, I leave instantly without checking other vendors.
---
On your aid vendor, include bobble heads, magazines and chems. Don't bother with diluted stuff. It never sells. Fill all 30 slots with top tier stuff.
---
Third vendor should be armour and weapons. If you have enough gear, split it into two vendors. Split it between good legendaries for 1000-2000 caps and basic but usable legendaries for about 350-500 caps. You can get more for high end gear, but I've found it better to sell for lower and get the turnover than charging a fortune and never getting sales.
---
Rare clothing sells. Put one of each rare outfit onto your armour vendor, if there's space. 
---
The next vendor should be plans. I sell less plans than anything else, so I stick to the rare plans only. I also sell those cheap. Even then Wendigo collosus plans, I've either given away free or sold for a couple of hundred caps. I personally only sell up to 12 plans at a time, and if I have 3 or less, I put them onto my aid vendor.
---
One last vendor, bulk junk. Ballistic fibre Always sells. So does Ultracite. All those things you main keeps running out of while crafting? Other people run out of them too. Good rare junk sells like crazy. 
---
Label everything. Put signs on every vendor and what they have in them. Make the shopping experience pleasurable for your punters.
---
Be reputable. Buying cheap stuff and reselling at higher prices is a fantastic short term strategy. But people notice when you clean out their vendors of 10 cap plans and hike the prices on your own. People sure as hell notice when a level 200+ hoovers up someone's free ammo camp at the Wayward, and they will hold it against you for the rest of the '76 days, and they will never shop at your place again. *Grumbles in bitter 'I was trying to do something nice' face* Long term, being a dick trader will burn bridges. Don't be that guy or girl. 
---
Finally, have an accessible stash box and crafting stations. I know the locked home debate rages, and for people who don't live the merchant lifestyle, I don't think it matters. But if your trying to create a CAMP that people will remember and visit everytime they see you on the same server as them, it makes a difference.
---
Vanilla, that stuff should be killer already. Now I have to grind for more gold to make that shit armor better,  nah I'm out.
---
It most certainly changes "meta hierarchy". AA has jumped up to Junkies level and might even be better than it in certain situations. TSE is apparently extremely good again. Angryturtle made a video comparing single shot damage on different weapon prefixes/major effects using low health build and 50 Cal. And TSE beat every single prefix/major effect combination he tested. Even BE.
---
[https://youtu.be/9EeNcV7OxZU?t=237](https://youtu.be/9EeNcV7OxZU?t=237)
---
Good question! One would think not, but it‚Äôs always a testable theory. You should try it. I can be a test dummy if you‚Äôre on Xbox.
---
Just chuck a grenade next to it.
---
A 1\* Junkie's shotgun should be magic, yeah. But the problem with magic shotguns is that they only reliably work in VATS. If you try to use them outside of VATS you'll get horrible rubberbanding healthbars.
---
I'm on ps4, sorry.
---
Yes in vats
---
This!!!! Its so often i reach my stash limit because i cant get myself to drop all the trash legendaries (think of the scrip tomORROW), some form of note or vouchers would be SUCH a lifesaver.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it would the same for a 3*? I rolled a junkies combat shotgun, I tend to stick with vats for it though.
---
Nice thanks!
---
Ah ok, that‚Äôs a shame, thought I‚Äôd got lucky and rolled two magic weapons but I‚Äôm happy with one!
---
You could become sentinel, the highest rank before elder. In fallout 4 it was cut, but they could reimplement it
---
You say watching YouTube is a waste of time, yet playing this game isn't?
---
Definitely would like the Sympto-Matic, that's my primary target for loot and the rest of it I'll consider the gravy.
---
Hit the nail on the head there son
---
Renamed Gamebryo, athough you're correct.
---
They could've just spend some money from immeasureable gain from Skyrim sales to develop a really good, brand new, and fitting for RPG gameplay game engine. It can be much better than some other "brand new at the moment of game release" engines; GTA as an example fits there.
---
Greedy investors, they always need more billions.
---
Thanks bro! I've just been playing this game like fallout 4 but with emotes.
---
The brotherhood outfit/mask looks brilliant! Thats my fav :)
---
I wish I wish we could have a PA backpack so I could stop being encumbered.
---
If you want mothman cultists but don't want to leave the forest, the church near the bottling plant is pretty neat. Theres a copper node next to it. Called Kanawha County cemetery
---
Thanks, could you post an imgur link here instead though please if you would be so kind? It's just as easy, but doesn't mean I have to hand my email out. :D
---
It is magic, explosive doubles your perceived firerate and then instigating is a magic effect. Even a non explosive 50. Cal can trigger the effect but it's rarer to see happen.
---
That is absolutely horrible, ngl. Bout to have like 50k gold at this rate, IF YOU COULD HOLD THAT MUCH.
---
It's like you're actually best off grinding it mindlessly for a week so that limit isn't wasted.
---
bloodied users use unyielding to help survivability. it doesn't increase endurance however so its lretty good for everything else especially agility meaning more ap to move around
---
The explosive damage on my vampire fixer does get a second activation of the vampire effect. Its possible it does.
---
Going to have to take my chances with the Paladin tiers for these, my best solo time so far is 9.5 minutes and I'm struggling to get it down further due to the time it takes for the signals to boost. It's working out at about 2.5-3 minutes per boost so that leaves sod all time to get the rest of the run done. 
---
Maybe the maps other than the Burrows have a bit more flexibility.
---
If you are talking about the Alien Blaster 'VATS Unknown' then that is a 1 time reward for completing the arc. 
---
Once you complete her arc, you'll unlock the option to get the daily mission 'Space Limitations' that will guide you to a weapon case. Bringing this case back to her will give you a random legendary.
---
The thing is, you can't rely on a test on one specific target.
---
Things are now situational. AA is worthless against low armored enemy or against weak point...
---
Besides, the low health build will remain powerful no matter which legendary you use. And you will still need all damage boosts you can get, this won't really change from what you did before.
---
You are right, will do so later.
---
Does it actually do anything?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the bunker I was speaking of.
---
Not to mention you only have 4 minutes after the nuke lands to join. After that the only way in is to join a team with someone already inside and hope the instance isn't already at Max players.
---
Good extra info. Don't have any medics (because... cmon its medics), but good to know.
---
To an extent, I do agree that they need to rebalance the perks themselves to factor in more towards than additive formula. Demo expert should be reverted back to Max rank being plus 100%. The weapon specific ones should go from 10%, 15%, 20% to 10%, 20%, 30% depending on the rank of the card
---
Just like how players can use frog legs in NW but i can't because my adventure mode (with marsupial) dosent have the right special points.
---
you do you, but it's not cool when some get credits for other people works.
---
But it's internet I guess.
---
I really appreciate it. I try to collect screenshots, and this is one I'm struggling to get.
---
I‚Äôm much the same. Moving my camp around would be pretty diverting, but I absolutely dread dealing with the fussy, punitive building system again.
---
May depend on map but i was testing the ops in PTS and i managed to get Elder rank rather easily by running as fast as i could to the signal boosters while ignoring any mobs along the way (with enough AP to never run out of running speed). Only started killing the enemies once i was inside the timed area, while never leaving it until finished. My time was pretty consistently ~7 minutes. Requires that you know the map very well. Doing it with 4man group is a joke.
---
Yes, although YMMV. 
---
The explosive effect doubles hit rate and can trigger the magic. I have a Junkies Explosive 50 cal that works much better than it should (I'm not junkies build). It melts SBs and Sheepsquatches, provided I hit them so that both the bullet and explosive effect is limited to one body part.
---
Again, dataminer group is providing us the information. Not the developers of some software used to do the file reading.
---
It only gives 100 power? Why the hell would anyone choose that massive thing over a fusion generator, lol.
---
What‚Äôs your ps4 username
---
Ehhh idk, I'm not sure another engine could do what they want it to do with less work than it would take to just keep on improving their current engine 
---
I mean it's buggy sure but it's also running much more complicated worlds than most other games, when you think about all the interractable objects, npc schedules and interactions, not to mention all the physics as well
---
Even in games like The Witcher, NPCs when not being spoken to seem so lifeless, and usually have a very simple routine if they're not just standing in a single spot forever, and the items if visible in the world are usually bolted onto the ground 
---
Obviously fo76 has some of this stuff dialed down a bit from the singleplayer games like skyrim and fallout 4, but they did kinda imply fo76 was them trying to implement multiplayer into their current engine 
---
So maybe they will use what they've learned to make better multiplayer mechanics in future games, while they're figuring out fo76
---
There's no reason to scrap an engine, any coding can be improved, I just think they have different priorities in improving the engine than what most players would want them to focus on
---
That cap farming sounds interesting because I make about 85% of my average daily caps from players vending legnedarys for super cheap so people can scrip or use them.
---
Spamming the post over and over again every few minutes won't make you get help faster, might even make it slower. And spamming is againts sub rules.
---
If you still need suggestions the acid and lead node south of foundation  are pretty great. Huge cliff. Fun challenge to build around. I had a very tall apartment complex style building

I'm behind the times, are these for the new patch
---
I've noticed that reddit has been posting things several times on every sub. I think it's the app, not the OP.
---
You could also just add the credit in your post, you know ?
---
This cost nothing.
---
I‚Äôll send you a friend request so I can join your server
---
Not when there is several minutes between the posts i'd assume.
---
All of these particular posts were posted the same time for me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è All say three minutes ago.
---
I'm  guessing it's to narrow down character specialization further and make them more unique.  Really can swap alot of different builds into the same special spread right now, not possible to do the same thing when you're scrapping "extra" cards for coins. Kinda neat. People who want to keep that flexibility will just have to level up legendary stuff slower, and it's incentive to start new characters and play through the story stuff again. I could be wrong though, the why's are definitely interesting, but I can understand why they don't want to lift the curtain on game design decisions to much. Loses some of the enjoyment when you're concious of how your experience is being curated, and it derails the feedback. It's more useful to get feedback about why things aren't fun instead of feedback about why their reasons are dumb, lol. All just wild speculation though.
---
Oddly enough every time I seem to end up in the burrows, when it spawned with robots that run turned into an 12 minute war of attrition.
---
I plan to take the legendary agility perk to help increase my jetpack running time (T-65 user) as that'll get my agility to 10, maybe that'll help make the difference. Power Sprinter would probably help too, but that perk just seems like a waste in the face of others.
---
First ones were couple minutes apart, latest ones were at the same time. I don't see them anymore so can't doublecheck as i reported them for spamming.
---
Get your feelings out of the way and think it through.  With damage being additive instead of multiplicative it makes it much more straightforward to balance items.
---
  If they clip off 10% damage or buff 10% damage on the base of something post change, it is gonna result in a 10-20% difference. where right now a 10% base change can result in like a 40% damage difference due to multipliers. 
---
Yes the initial hit is gonna suck, but if in exchange we can actually get some weapon and build variation in the game it will be worth it in the long run.
---
This answer for sure hah whatever you got that you think looks fire, wear that!
---
The problem was when you had a friend who like to have all of his quests marked as active, and you had to fight with half a screen of text.
---
that's awesome
---
Why did you post this seven times
---
Wow. Okay, then. Have a great day.
---
Couple of good keepers, but mostly trash ... roughly 5000 scrip spent in 500 increments over multiple servers.
---
Last roll ... The Fixer, Explosive &amp; DR while reloading ... Assassin's. They better make that apply to NPCs too.
---
The thing is that players cant fast travel to workshops so as long as you are claiming one when there is noone else nearby you wont get into PvP
---
Yeah, sorry, was on mobile phone and fat fingers
---
Yes, i like this one instead of uncap daily gold bullion and scrip
---
Yes. Read the most recent itv
---
If you bring me a super sledge I can mod it for 2000 caps.
---
Im also on xbox.
---
Exactly I found a j e lmg that I wanna use just cant keep the damn thing fed.
---
Thank you, working the night shift I thought I was about to miss out on stuff
---
I believe that is the plan for the Assassin's weapons which would make it kind of useful except it's only 10% compared to the 30% for Ghoul and Mutant Slayers.
---
You have nothing else to do? That's pretty sad.
---
I get it. Night shift is brutal
---
They should be a permanent addition to the game, so you won't miss anything
---
From what I have read so far. If you own a PS4 game on disc then you will need the PS5 disc drive version to play the game. If you own the PS4 digital version, you are good to go because everything will transfer to the new all digital system.BUT!!! Keep in mind the games you play. If you are like me and have actual disc that have to be inserted each time you play? You will have to get a PS5 with a disc drive. If you get a digital version of the PS5, then you will have to repurchase those games to play them on it.
---
Now this would be hilarious
---
I'm going for the rads for now but i'll wait a good month for returns.  
---
I'd like to be able to go on nuked zone with my full legendary armor, priority is movement and when i put the stealth suit on i feel really slow.
---
I can do that for you, I have make shift warrior and fix it good
---
PSN smokythc
---
Agree.
---
If only the fo76 PvP was as good as glorious ds2 PvP combat
---
Nope. Completely useless unless you want red smoke
---
I've been hoping for a visit ever since I've heard about Insult bot, and the only time it did was when I was in the menu with a Vendor bot, while it was telling its joke - _-
---
I didn't even realise it until I got the Insult Bot receipt popup and saw it waddling away.
---
Oh man, that outfit looks amazing - headgear, not so much but still cool.
---
Is there anymore info on the survival weapons that we're supposed to be getting again. I heard they were supposed to drop from this new daily ops.
---
i just hope the main quest is fixed, currently it's bugged at the part where you get the inoculation against the scorched plague and my alt account can't get past it.
---
Man, I wish it was unlimited storage. It's just junk. Can't hold ammo, weapons, legendaries, or even misc items like ore and certain other crafting mats. Just broken down junk items. Would love to be able to just stash tons and tons of missles and mini nukes in that bad boy.
---
Using armour to trigger faster fire rate weapons no longer works in PTS, bash damage on  shotguns do that all hit one spot thing, but damage isn't increased any. So that seems patched.
---
I kill him because he‚Äôs an asshole. And I can. There‚Äôs not enough people to kill, so I kill players, but the PvP is too tightly restricted in this game so there‚Äôs not enough killings... I would give up PvP indefinitely if I could kill PITA, in the Vault.
---
These things are seriously out of control and gotten worse just recently.
---
he hits me at the weirdist fucking times. I'm out in the middle of the mire just killing a scorchbeast. It falls to the ground, I turn around, and bam insulted.
---
It‚Äôs not the same at all
---
It's not just about the atomic shop.  It looks good on their reports to shareholders etc. where they can say "look how many players we have logging in every day!"
---
But yea weekly limits would be more convenient for the players no doubt.
---
It looks like they will be adding more of them at later dates (if they actually have said that all of them would be making a comeback), since there is only one on the loot list.
---
Weird troll. 
---
No loot boxes are in this game. No pay to win. Yong dong complains about everything and makes it seem like a half second of lag is game breaking.
---
Yep, to be honest I was really surprised they went with a multiplicative increase in the first place. Blew my mind.
---
I think you should stop spreading fear. there are thousands of duped weapons circulating. They aren't flagging accounts for having a (1) duped weapon. Nobody have been banned for having a duped weapon. It's not an issue.
---
Whats the range bug?
---
Yes this. My main has been sneaky a sniper + shotgun. Sniper +  2 hand melee. Bloodied   
---
 2 hand melee then unarmed. Bloodied sniper + unarmed. And now heavy gunner + unarmed + sniper. If scrapping perks was there from the beginning I wouldn't have played the game nearly as much as I did. I take a break and come back when we get new content, I have an idea for a camp, a new character or to make a new build. Next is commando.
---
Definitely, but they're also armed - just down the stairs in the rusty pick you can find a dead little guy, usually with a pump action.
---
Thanks I really want the chance at an unstoppable monster üëπ
---
Yea that DCG is.. Hmm exactly that.. An unstoppable monster :)
---
The problem I find is... To many pistol perks in agility,   9 just for damage... 3 hip fire,  3 for running speed and 3 for weight reduced..
---
18.... What about the other agility perks?  They need to move them to perception or change the damage perk to just 3 points for 60% damage.
---
Alway buy  three or less and if you not seeing a prefixes you like hop servers. Im convinced there is lists it draws from based on the server and your character. Different characters on the same private seems to draw different lists. But the same character on the same server will pull consistently fom the same lists. Some people juat think this is bs but there something wonky about the rng.
---
Spam it when you do get it. Same for crafting. Otherwise if you spam it at the wrong time you will have all junk. Spam it when
---
It is big and makes no noise.
---
Yeah. Both communities are alike. But DS2 PVP is unbeatable to this day.

This is a hoarding game
---
Ive been meaning to go back to ds2, I miss it alot, just gonna be a commitment since I lost my old saves 
---
Maybe after this new fo76 season haha
---
And i want to thank the software creators mommys and daddys for making the developers.
---
Agh, wish I could get this. I have a vampire gatling laser, but not an ultracite one D:
---
how the heck you get so much scrip D: Is there a way to get more than they 150 a day from the scrapper?
---
When‚Äôs this supposed to drop as I know it‚Äôs in test atm.
---
Out of 8000 scrip I got probably 20 three star junkie weapons, with two being good.
---
Only two bloody, one being a b/ffr/per combat shotgun which is decent.
---
RNG is unpredictable.
---
Edit: just got in one more set of 750 scrip before the event ends and rolled a b/crit/250 Fixer on my second to last try.  LOL. Not incredible, but I‚Äôll take it.
---
I collected 1000 scrip on two different characters before the sale, and 4 days x 150 scrip x 2 characters takes care of the rest. EDIT: I actually had more than 2600 (3200) :D Math B hard.
---
Playing this game is basically a full time job at this point. I guess what you can do is save up all of the necessary legendary weapons for the week (21 3* weapons and 14 2* weapons) and log off next to a train station so you could cash them in within 5 minutes every day. Its a shitty solution but you'd at least get your scrip really fast. I doubt Bethesda will ever change this, but it would be cool if they put it on the same timer as smiley. One of the "problems" with weekly limits is you can get more than 150 scrip by doing dailies but seeing as that's *already* capped to once a day it wouldn't affect extending it to a weekly limit.
---
Ok. I‚Äôm wrong, you are totally right. That‚Äôs why the game is like it is.üòÇüòÇü§î.
---
Bring on the downvotes.....
---
So the solar is the better armor over the secret service. Ugh all that time wasted and GOLD!!!
---
You don‚Äôt need toilet paper to take a shit, but it sure helps....üòÇ
---
I don't run all the defensive perks. Nerd Rage, Serendipity, Fireproof ... and poison on the armor.
---
If I die, I die.
---
ahhh. Dang. I was hoping! I just came back after a long break. GF and I decided to get back into it. We only had like 500 scrip, I didn't get jack for my heavy guns build but got like 10 freaking rifles for her lmao.
---
Tomorrow, September 15.
---
I like them being non hostile for precisely the same reason. It's not very often in the modern Fallout games you are made to feel bad for killing, I hope it stays. It adds an element of some good roleplay to the event.
---
If you die right after the event and are spawned outside of the mine, fast travel to a teammate that is still in the mine, run down the escape tunnel and you will be able loot Earl.
---
:D thats the way it usually goes
---
Managing your inventory is part of the game challenge. Just drop the extra legendaries.
---
Sure man, if I can recommend anything it‚Äôs just to try and do the daily quests for Foundation and Crater as often as you can if you aim to play for the long term.
---
I rolled a medics combat rifle and than a ghoul slayer ffr pipe pistol with my main on the first night. At that point i stopped and bought 18 modules and gave up on the sale.
---
Than lastnight i was transfering a few things between characters. Logged in on my one alt and realized hes at 900 scrip. Dropped 900 scrip and the best i got was a Furious,FFr, FMWA raduim rifle. At this point i transfered a few weapons to my other alt who is a lvl 85ish character who has become a glorified mule. 
---
I had 199 scrip on this guy, so i said screw it might as well burn it up. First roll BE FMWA Light machine gun. Cant complain anout that, atleast i got something outta the sale.
---
It unfortunately goes live tomorrow. Well... It‚Äôs fortunate for the griefers because the low levels will be squishy *and* unable to deal damage.
---
Pacifist on and griefers ain‚Äôt an issue. Be interesting to see what actually drops. 80% which is what‚Äôs being banded about would be ridiculous. I‚Äôll wait to worry when it actually drops if I‚Äôm honest. Every time there‚Äôs any kind of update there‚Äôs so much worry and panic. Look at all the posts with calculations saying legendary run couldn‚Äôt be completed.
---
This is a modding community, that's all.Usually, you just give credit for all involved tools and people in that context
---
xEdit requires hundreds of hours of developpement \*for free\* for the community, while reading a record in the tool require 10 seconds.
---
Did you try the camera trick to find the body?
---
I had FO1st just for a month, and i legit only farmed like 3 days. That was almost half a year ago. I just finally ran out of adhesive and low on springs (somehow), beeni doing repair  atom challenges. I run out of steel more than anything lol 1st made me drop my loot goblin habits. I only loot what i need.
---
I literally just did the math for a basic Bloodied commando build. For a more advanced one that uses adrenaline, VATS perks, and buffs it‚Äôs an even bigger drop off.
---
Solar Panels and new signs. Genuinely looking forward to those rewards a little bit more than the others. I always wanted to build my own town and I've never quite been satisfied with the ones I have made in the past. Signs go a long way to adding to that ambience.
---
I think from your comment that you aren‚Äôt moving the camp device to a different spot just turning it in place. If I‚Äôm wrong about I apologize. I had my camp at the Lead deposit/acid deposit cliff (and other cliff sides) a couple of times and after much moving of my camp device I was able to get the spawn site right in a good spot. The spawn site will always be to the north of the camp device. At my current camp I moved my device until I got it set so the spawn site is 100 yards north of my front door.
---
As I said. Everyone did the math saying legendary run couldn‚Äôt be completed. Let‚Äôs see what actually drops. If it‚Äôs an 80% nerf then the only viable build would be bloodied. I‚Äôll wait before I kick off
---
I hope not, but fear that you might be correct.
---
This is nice to hear. Was wondering how much id have to repair my SS armor since stealth wont be a thing.
---
It‚Äôs only 80% on Bloodied because of the sheer number of buffs and different synergies it uses. Other builds will still be nerfed but they‚Äôre not as badly affected.
---
yeah, sale was disappointing as always. didnt had 12k scrip like someone i read here but the best thing i got from about 2k was a Qbash25lvc gauss rifle which i put in the vendor for 2,5k and its still waiting for someone. but hey, life goes on :)  
---
  
---
and btw, for searching corpses: did you try the camera? aim with it and jump around, perhaps the legendarys name pops up in the upper right. doesnt work always but its worth a try.
---
I love that bot. He finds me in the most out of the way places too. I think I see him in the bog the most, but he did get me in the driveway of the Overseer‚Äôs house once.
---
And it didn‚Äôt work properly a vast majority of the time anyway.
---
Ok so it‚Äôs not bloodied. Which is just the bloodied part. It‚Äôs all low health builds. Junkies. Heavies. Anything low health. Which is the meta for damage in any build is nerfed by 80%. Full health is already significantly weaker in damage dealt so any drop will be significant if it‚Äôs only half of bloodied at 40%. Again. I‚Äôll wait to see what actually drops.
---
I just give my noob friend all the high level legendarys he can keep what he wants sell what he wants and I can scrip the left overs. Scrip isn't very useful to me because I can't find a legendary that's any better than my current
---
1st just made my habits worse, to be honest. Now, there's no reason for me *not* to grab absolutely everything!
---
You don't need faction for some items you just buy them at the vault.   SS armor is amazing I wouldn't pass on it. If you get near the cap
---
Wait... you guys dont eat your ammo?
---
Get ready for the level infinity rad roach in the forest... Ten times more difficult to kill than Earle and the Scorchbeast Queen put together!
---
Make another char, lvl to 50 in couple days, scrip away excess legendaries.
---
I think I saw something in the upcoming notes that they‚Äôre going to be hostile when they come back.
---
&gt;off the grid build
---
What is an off the grid build exactly?
---
Lol. Well as I probably kill it 5 times over per shot right now I‚Äôll not panic to much. Do 2500 damage a shot to supermutants and u can 1 shot em with 800. It‚Äôs more Earle and the queen will need more damage dealers than 1 which works fine atm.
---
Yeah , it probably ended up on a roof somewhere üòÇ
---
Because they have no idea how to balance anything and the relative strengths of gear and perks in this game are the result of the numbers they arbitrarily entered during the initial build of the game and never got to balance because the game was rushed to release.
---
So it‚Äôs all dropping tomorrow? Legendary perks. Damage buff. One wasteland and the new instances. What can possibly go wrong!
---
It's a meme weapon, like the paddle bat and commie whacker
---
Level 3 would scrap for six
---
No no, I don‚Äôt think you understand. It has 50,000 HP, all of its SPECIAL stats are 65, and it has 1000 DR, ER and its immune to radiation. Oh and it‚Äôs not affected by explosive damage at all. Then you‚Äôve been nerfed so it‚Äôs even more difficult. Have a nice day!
---
As of the last patch you can switch between doorways and all other kind of walls again, at least on PS4.
---
Here‚Äôs betting on another dupe glitch going public! Fifty dollars one goes live!
---
Crossbows need more love - the entire archery section does.
---
I think the bows received a stealth buff a while ago. At least I remember the different arrow mods reducing the range drastically - that seems to no longer be the case.
---
Probably! I have seen those car explosions throw those ghouls so so far.
---
Yeah I tried it thanks but couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere , even started to doubt it was a legendary I slotted lol, it was in that long straight at the shops/cabins and I git carried away when I saw it in the distance and poured in rounds from my auto handmade , then dashed in and got caught up in the explosions (thank you dense chest piece - I love you) left a couple of bodies but no legendary
---
I love trying to talk to him again and he says: ‚ÄúNothing personal‚Äù ‚ÄúWalk it off.‚Äù
---
Ive gotten lucky and found 4 in vendors for 2k tops lol.
---
Yeah it makes a nice visual but boy does it suck trying to find them again lol , I was wandering around looking in bushes aswell like a right nutter üòÇ
---
Yea I thought at one point fallout first would include unlimited junk storage, and scrip not sure why gold bullion has a max of 5,000 when scrip is way behind at 1,500. It sucks and I highly doubt it will every change as much as I want it to Bethesda can't be bothers with things like this not unless people stopped played altogether or spending any money on atoms. As for me I don't touch any legendaries anymore I leave them.
---
Don‚Äôt know why we can‚Äôt have unlimited scrip turn in but limited daily rolls. You still have to log in daily to keep there numbers up and it frees up server strain with less items on the server .
---
You extrapolate too far... I just say to be careful, and maybe to not be so proud with legacy weapon.
---
Explains their lack of response!
---
I think it‚Äôs a hold over from those of us the have played since launch. In the early days there were a lot of griefers that liked nothing better than finding low levels and killing them in workshops because ‚Äúit‚Äôs part of the game‚Äù Some of us leveled slower than others so a month or two into the game you could have level 100+ taking out a level 25 and just being a jerk about it. Beth has made a lot of the griefing practices impossible now so it‚Äôs not as bad for newer players. I don‚Äôt see griefers any more but that may be because I‚Äôm at a much higher level than most griefers want to tackle. I also watched a lot of griefers on YouTube and learned what to be on the lookout for so I could avoid them.
---
A few of those dont have bad prefixes, people will always want fixers, but it depends on the other effects honestly
---
&gt; the sole reason they provide caps
---
Boy, do I have news for you.
---
Can you awesome thanks
---
New game engine can atleast get rid of all the known problems with physics, bugs, exploits, known console commands (you do remember players were able to visit QASmoke?), and other stuff like that.
---
Any coding can be improved, that is true, but its core is the same.
---
So, yeah, i'm sure they could do better and avoid all these troubles with full inventory theft, bugged cheat weapons selling on eBay, et cetera.
---
Yeah my luck has been really bad. I‚Äôm not usually a conspiracy theorist but I‚Äôm convinced they tone down the drops for the sale.
---
-drops nocturnal rolling pin-
---
I've been playing offline with the Second Sin mod. It's quite good. I will always miss the Fight Clubs at the bridge but that will never come back.
---
At present bloodied builds can one shot most things and it's possible to solo end game bosses in a matter of seconds. Whine all you like about damage reduction but rebalancing really is needed.
---
Great post mate, I think it's the first one I've seen where it's literally been laid out, top marks! üëç
---
Met this bot today. Told me he heard that you got rewards from Vaults, and insulted my intelligence, asking what my reward was for being so dumb. Which was accurate. Fo76 has been the only Fallout where I‚Äôve just been grabbing what perks I find useful. Usually I go for Charisma and Intelligence.
---
Not to mention you can just watch the angry turtle videos. You can literally just Google this. The list of magic affect is literally in the thumbnail for the video.
---
Haha please enlighten me and I don't want that to sound like a dick...
---
Tbh a nerf is probably in order. I shouldn‚Äôt with a bloodied commando build be able to take on a SB. Supposedly the toughest mother in the wilderness. With a crafted fixer, and kill it in 3 seconds
---
Got it on the PTS and it saves me a trip to Whitesprings and crafting disease cures etc.. really good addition
---
Yes, they can be done solo, can be tricky to get under 8 mins if you die or get a bit lost running around, but it's certainly achievable
---
&gt;I have also stated reasons why the particular market you're fixated about is source of exceptions
---
I just want to be crystal clear with this. What you're saying is that the single largest data set that dwarfs all over data you obtain from your various sources is the thing you exclude from your pricing data? You're seriously saying this?
---
I mean I thought you were mask off before but this is rather exceptional if what I understand the case to be true. This would make Fed76 a cautionary tale of textbook selection bias. By excluding the single largest data set of pricing, the pricing you do show isn't reflective of reality.
---
A statement from Fed 76:
---
["The system has been build based on extensive market research ON PC ecosystem - and hence is reflecting console reality less precisely. Remember, this is just a price approximation based on global PC market. "](https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None)
---
"Extensive market research" is just an outright lie because, by your own admission, you exclude the largest data set on the PC platform.
---
&gt;If the vending model changed to global auction house system, NONE of what is the current Player Vending nature would remain.
---
Yes, what you say is true. What you exclude to mention is that your own biased pricing would also be invalidated. You think you'll be able to maintain the ridiculously high prices you have on Fed76 when casuals start to flood the auction house?
---
Auction houses don't raise prices to be maximal for what you can get away with pricing. It's the opposite. It'll be the minimum price that you could possibly sell something at. So most of the prices on your site would have to necessarily fall, because, once again to be that broken record, your exclude all in game pricing.
---
&gt;As it is now, its luck-and-location based lottery.
---
This statement is laughably invalidated with a single case - serum prices.
---
People know from experience and communication via platforms just like reddit and discord that the average market price for serums is from 200-500 caps. Not the 750-1k that people were trying to force onto the market in the early days, 200-500. It can be a bit higher and even a bit lower but, at least from my experience and from seeing from various sites, regional variation does little to impact this price at all.
---
Do you know why the price is reasonably stable between regions for serums - the sharing of knowledge. When people are low information, that's when you have considerable variations in pricing. Once people see and discuss it, you get closer to an equilibrium point. We've reached that for serums. Same too with most ammo, fusion cores and to a lesser extent stims.
---
Fed 76 could help to facilitate this equilibrium pricing. You and I both know that instead Fed 76 is a roadblock to equilibrium, by your own admission.
---
Super reactor is huge though, needs a lot of space to be put down.
---
Do you spend scrip while server hopping because of superstition? It seems like no matter how I spend it, private server or not, the chances of getting jack shit are incredibly high. I spent 1000 between 2 and 3 stars on my main and got... pretty much nothing. I made an alt last week and lvld her to 50, got her to 1000 scrip then only learned The Fixer plan. Spent 1000 scrip on mostly 2 stars and a few 3... got jack shit. 
---
Oh well. Plenty of fodder for the foreseeable future
---
Yeah, my combat shotgun his magic, but even though having multiple supposed magic effects, I cannot get my Gatling laser to produce magic damage.
---
Yes you can. It will be more difficult but very doable. Getting the Elder rank can be harder if you are not an experienced player with decent gear/build. But that too can be achieved solo.
---
Need to sell them repair kits. Can't do that if you're one-shotting everything.
---
How is this any different than me having five characters, each with their own camp in a normally buildable area, and then loading into a server on one of the characters?  Some people are over thinking this. All people are asking for is something that is already in the game but that might need to be tweaked ever so slightly.  The only issue would potentially occur with vending or displays, as the game would have to check whether said items were removed while playing your character in another camp instance. However, this also means shared stash across all of your camps tied to the character, so people would have to be fine with 800 stash across all saved instances.
---
Thank you! That's good to hear.
---
Thanks! I'm a high-ish level but I'll make sure I'm as prepared as possible before doing one. (:
---
Maybe they designed it to be for those instanced camps we are supposed to be getting at some point. Which are kinda like vaults right? (hopefully you can pick a theme for them, like cave, vault etc.)
---
How is that whining? How is putting the numbers out whining? If you want me to whinge and bitch, I can whinge and bitch. Yes, bloodied melee builds need a nerf, and commando could do with one too. But can you not see what‚Äôs happening here completely neuters everyone, not just Bloodied? Bloodied is still going to be the best build. In fact, it might even become the only viable build.
---
you can, but you will often have to change the build due to mutations of enemies
---
And just to think this is happening tomorrow.
---
Yeah maybe. I had to scrap a 4x2 garden to place it..
---
Try out the stalkers minigun to see if it's a "magic" one. I had a magic stalkers a while back I ended up scripping after I had some fun with it first.  Thing would kill sheepsquatches in about 2 seconds and could take the queen down in less than 30.  Fun to play around with if you aren't going to be a dick with it and ruin scorched earth for other people.  Just need to slap an accelerated barrel on it and find something to shoot at.
---
Yes a nerf probably is in order. But that‚Äôs just point blank neutering everybody. With a sawn off shotgun.
---
Special Scorched named Bob. With Red Ryder BB behind his back.
---
Theoretically it should be... 209 firerate with 50 Limb Damage.
---
Not ever having a magic weapon I have no idea what it should look like performance wise.
---
I went to the farm south of watoga and used on the ML Queen there and killed her in a few seconds (3-4)
---
This would be fine around the Great TSE nerf. But changing it this late in the game is the problem.
---
Yea not really logical generator type for the outdoors :D
---
Are there any datamined pictures of these?
---
Definitely most excited for the Legendary Perk Cards too.
---
This
---
I am NOT specced for heavies at all... Not sure that makes a difference
---
Like the quote says "better be safe than sorry". So yeah, I'm definitely picking up those Mr. hanzy fuel.
---
I don't have links to any of them but i have seen them posted on youtube (atleast some). Search by using the name of the object you wanna look at.
---
Agreed. Found a BFFR laser rifle in a vendor just yesterday. If you want to spend the time looking, they still have a ton of value.
---
They're making it easier to adjust because they're planning on making adjustments. Fucking obvious really but still we get endless whining but I assume that's because this sub doesn't allow picture posts to explain shit.
---
archery is op if done right.  
---
A guy i play with deals over 8k damage per hit with his one star bloodied compound bow.  
---
Bows benefit from the same chems rifles do.
---
Sounds like it works then.  I usually test weapons on the behemoth at Solomon's pond, but sheepsquatches are also good test targets.  If the health bar just instantly drains it is most likely working though it's far from reliable and seems to depend on the server.  Sometimes it murders things and then other times it just makes them pissed at you lol.
---
Boom
---
The sale ends today at 10am or at 11:59pm?
---
I always go and see player vendors if I want a good weapon. Because of the limited stash space they are more or less pre-selected already. Noone keeps too much trash in their stash.
---
Take your salt elsewhere. The numbers are clear, and so is the effect on everyone. Bloodied and food builds are hit the hardest, especially bloodied food builds wether you like it or not. Good day.
---
I saw on the preview that one was something like "can only be killed by melee." I have a strength of 2 right now so that one will be fun lol
---
Buy the bulk resource off npc or ammo off player
---
Not sure about everyone else, but I'm fairly excited! Plus its going to be great getting rid of allllllll those extra perk cards we never use! üëç
---
Not OP commenter, but I think I remember you too, from about 2 weeks ago because I went on to mention to a friend about Mojave from New Vegas - sadly they've never played it!
---
Sorry apparently that's a waste of time
---
Wait it does? Huh
---
Welcome to my full health world. You will still be doing way more damage then I do and I've managed to do OK so far, level 390+. I know the update nerfs all builds but  I don't typically use as much stacking of damage buffs to get the job done.
---
That would be really fun, but... it would allow easier farming of mats which is not what Beth want, they want regular logins and constant farming.
---
Like when you completed previous fallout games and went back to play it through on survival mode to add a little challenge and make it interesting again
---
Jesus that's bit lucky that amazing.
---
Ah yes I found it. For those interested, [here‚Äôs a video that shows (some) of the rewards](https://youtu.be/TWWhTBYe-DU)
---
Please don't tell me you binned that medics combat shotgun
---
You can drop them to 1hp with gunfire than bash them to finish them off.
---
I‚Äôm dreading PvPing anyone with good gear and Quantums. A legacy really will be the only thing that will cut through Quantums and all that shit, if even they will be able to. I‚Äôm running ass/sent ever since I traded an FE90 gat plas for it not a few hours ago. Together with Quantums I can already tank almost anything thrown my way. Now there will be nothing that can kill me if everything that does damage is being nerfed to shit.
---
"Instigating Short Handmade" this could be very good if the other roles are useful. As could this "Medics combat shotgun" if it has explosive. Even more so if it also has less vats.
---
The limits force players to login everyday which is what Bethesda need for their reports.
---
I know üòÇüòÇüòÇ, im not even a bloodied build anymore, gave 2 to friends, sold the other 2 at 12k each, for a little folding money, and kept the one i got from survival.
---
Thx, gonna edit that youtube video in.
---
Just tried it on the behemoth and cut him down in about a second and a half... However long it took to fire about 35 rounds
---
Pay to win loot boxes?  Wtf...
---
I do because I like my PvP. Cutting through ass/sent and Quantums was hard then, it‚Äôll be even harder if not impossible now.
---
weekly? ü•∫ some of us don‚Äôt get to play every week
---
I guess we‚Äôll see how it plays out tomorrow, if nothing else, it‚Äôs going to change a lot of builds!
---
‚ÄúBloodied‚Äù is the only OP thing in his setup. A bloodied commando is also OP. As is a bloodied stealth sniper and a bloodied heavy. Bloodied melee is ESPECIALLY OP.
---
Archery by itself sucks in the damage department when compared to non-bloodied heavies for example.
---
Fallout 76 is always running in *easy mode* so everything has to be balanced accordingly.
---
12 k man that's unreal wouldn't care got game when I came out and couldn't get into it at all. Then managed to get hooked after wastelanders but I missed so much good stuff in-between.
---
Especially during the Scoreboard when we had to kill legendary enemies amd do events where you would probably get more legendaries. I would get more legendary items than I could scrip sometimes and I had to deal with the extra weight for at least a day
---
I didn't bin any of them
---
50DR while aiming, bashing damage 40%
---
Medics on combat rifles can be really good if its not something shit like bash damage and has vats effects
---
I will be installing the Charisma perk Suppressor in order to neuter their damage even further first thing tomorrow with the legendary perks.
---
\^\^üòí\^\^ This
---
Good to know! I'll definitely be doing that.
---
üòä
---
That looks incredible.  My one small complaint is that I wish it didn‚Äôt have the insignia on the arm.
---
That‚Äôs a good call actually, I used to always run it, but now it‚Äôs be a really good perk to have!
---
The big thing I want is Gauss Minigun, and that is raider specific is it not?
---
Wait, that increases your odds?
---
I only sell serums 90+different magazines 5 types of ammo and any good weapons the rest gets dumped,scripped or sold
---
I mean, I can‚Äôt blame them, because holy shit, 95% of you tubers need to learn some brevity. Motherfuckers be rambling on and on and not making much sense and not being clear at all. I personally hate watching videos to find out information. I would much prefer to take 10 seconds to look at a list than listen to someone read me that list interspersed with inane chatter for eight minutes.
---
Explosive / 90%rww
---
Correct, so do the photos on foundation and sell to raiders every day along with raider daily quest.  Can also wander the swamp,savage, and bog and rescue random raider npc patrols from mobs then talk to each one.  It took me about 30 days doing all that.
---
Feels like the night before a dentist appointment for me where I will have an extraction sans anaesthesia, but you do you üòâüòä
---
Had a black screen bug a few times but only upon entering a server which I guess hadn't finished updating yet but was still accessible. Could see the UI on top of the black screen and map could be opened, but that's about it.
---
totally with you.   
---
also, i like the idea of the new damage calculation. even with my mediocre build and equip i at least twoshot everything beside SB (which takes like 10 sec for a regular one) and the two big ones. endgame should be a little bit harder.
---
Renews with every hit
---
That is a magic shotgun! Try using it in VATS. No shotgun build and will melt anything
---
üòÇüëç
---
I just think it would be fun to follow the storm as it covers existing enemies rather than killing the 10 enemies in each nuke zone and walking away with hardened masses and ionized meat.
---
People will still have to launch, but right now there's not a lot of farming to be done where people launch since there isn't much alive around ACP or to the far southeast since most don't even want to enter the nuke zone at all. I haven't seen a Whitespring or Morgantown launch in months other than my own.
---
I suspect that the need for these materials is going to increase when one wasteland hits.
---
Mr Prize Bot, on the other hand, gets his face turned into scrap every time I see him coming
---
Yeah I‚Äôm bloodied and a few days ago picked up an explosive 10mm pistol , not perked for guerilla but have been messing about destroying max level suoermutants and ghouls too easily if you know what I mean
---
That is a really good gun.
---
If you can hoard nuke key cards and can afford a month of FO76 1st then launch a nuke in your private server. Every time you complete a farm run of Whitesprings you log out and back in to reset the enemies. Repeat till the nuke zone goes away. Then launch another nuke.
---
Should‚Äôve been in the game from the beginning but whatever bro
---
I've been wondering what Mumbels are going with all that legendary gear she gets from us. And now you say they are gathering more gear? Getting ready for the Molemen uprising?
---
Insult Bot is one of the single best features in FO76.
---
What should I try it on to test?
---
Mmm interesting. I might use it again then.
---
Run West Tek or Huntersville. It‚Äôll be your new favorite way to dump shotgun shells.
---
Not necessarily, SSA has better resistance, especially Rad resistance and a Jetpack option.  Solar is worthless on a low hp build since you have to be over 60% health for the healing perk to work.
---
I never got so many revolvers as I did this weekend! It was a clearance on revolvers sale!  Needless to say. I dont like or yse them. üò§
---
If you like the Top of the World area, try the base of the ski lift. It's a circular flat area at a slight angle.
---
You can use the pre-existing wooden rails as a guide, setting the camp circle around them and you'll have the little ski lift turnstyle as a yard decoration. 
---
I was camped here for 2 months, from level 5 to 40ish and played daily. Never once did I see the 'can't place camp' message. 
---
Plus it's the *only* way to get up to Top of the World for new players, so you'll get a good bit of foot traffic from those that can't freely fast travel yet. 
---
Also, that spot never got attacked. I actually thought they had removed camps being attacked until I moved my camp and instantly had molerats appearing. 
---
No nodes or plastic nearby (discounting the stack of plastic plates near Rose) but plenty of space for farming adhesive.
---
Two shot is still nowhere close to bloodied even after nerf lol
---
Yup
---
While we are at it, I would like the full benefits of armor whilst being naked. 
---
Real life and in game plz, Beth. I await your answer.
---
Thanks for th feed back. I will post what I currently have in my perks in a few. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
---
That is good then, not as good as less vats, but still a good 3rd. 
---
So a Medics explosive shotgun works in a really cool way. You and your team will get a healing boost for each part of the spread shell. So one vats critical hit can give like 8 stacked healing boosts.
---
so it can be great for a Medic player, and still lots of fun for a non Medic player.
---
Did you use it or sell it?
---
At least she talked to you. She just handed me a bag of shit and gave me the middle finger.
---
I am as hyped as you‚Äôre. I have played since beta and other then taking about a 6 month break I‚Äôve played this game the whole time. When ppl where trashing the game during launch I was still playing it and having fun. After two years it‚Äôs fun to me because 1 it‚Äôs fallout and I love exploring their worlds and finding new things, 2 I am still messing around with my build to build the perfect character for me and even after two years I still am learning new ways to perfect it and 3 it‚Äôs just so fun to go legendary farming or dropping nukes and taking the queen or earl down with randoms and just having fun. This game has truly came along way since launch and I‚Äôm so excited that they are bringing this new feature to us tomorrow. Now we can go do events in the forest and not take on only level 6 enemies. We get new daily ops which from what I‚Äôve seen they look fun as hell. And we get the start of season 2 battle pass, which from also what I‚Äôve seen looks better then season 1. Specially the armor skins look so much better. Yeah I‚Äôm looking at you ghille suit. Lol but I‚Äôm excited and ready to try all this stuff out tomorrow when I get off work and put my kids to bed at night. It‚Äôs going to be fun and I‚Äôm ready.
---
Wait really? How. Im assuming I missed some news.
---
It's magic, worth a lot of caps
---
Who the hell isn't upvoting this?
---
Doesn't really matter if you are speced or not.  Might kill things a fraction of a second sooner but that's about it.  
---
The craziest one I had was a berserkers, more damage with less armor and I only used it with power armor.  It seriously did 1-2 damage per bullet to the queen but on a private server it killed her in under 10 seconds once.  Such a stupid bug that needs to get fixed but it can be pretty entertaining to mess around with.  They are still working on the PTS too so the next patch probably won't fix it either.
---
Instigating handmade is good. Prime full auto receiver with max commando perks and you have a good every day weapon.
---
My suggestion is start doing alot of Earle runs and collect the cursed weapons. I have 2 mules full of just the cursed weapons they are super light and always 3 star, so you have all the script you need without all the weight
---
Is that what's going on?
---
I'm wondering how people farm nuclear materials these days. Mostly I see people nuke fissure prime in such a way that they can kill the SBQ without ever entering the nuke zone, then they leave. There's not much other than violet flux there anyway, and it rarely see anyone in the nuke zone. 
---
I figured everyone is just getting their flux from joining the SBQ battles, and not actually smelting it. Bethesda should know.
---
Instigating on a Handmade isn't exactly terrible. Use it as a rifleman instead of commando and it could easily one hit all lesser mobs.
---
Yes. How can I build a fusion generator but can't tie a piece rope to my backpack so it can fit over my PA?
---
It‚Äôs a worthwhile bonus. Especially since it is a multiplicative bonus in a world of additives come tomorrow. For example with the patch: 
---
weapon perks, bloody mess, and junkies gives you a 125% bonus damage. Tenderizer in this case is a 15%. Even if it was only a bonus for you and not your whole team, you wouldn‚Äôt pass up that for 3 points.
---
If the build was bloodied  at 20% health and had adrenal run and nerd rage on top of that you would have a 215% bonus damage. Tenderizer would then be giving a 22% bonus damage to you.
---
You are probably only allowed have one at the same time? Just like some of the other camp items.
---
The fact there is absolutely no challenge in the game currently, a nerf to damage as well as an enemy buff is a welcome change
---
Then why make one the final reward for an ally questline? And why give a loading screen sentence emphasising it as a powerful weapon?
---
I need to hop on private and run a queen
---
Todd Howard tells everyone he is a legendary lover!
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more with everything you just said, it‚Äôs fallout and I love it and love playing it and want to continue to love playing it
---
As long as we can choose which mutations to get rid of.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs my point , it wasn‚Äôt and now it is and I‚Äôm thankful for that. I should have had a mobile phone and internet when I was growing up but didn‚Äôt and now I think it‚Äôs great that I do
---
First time I saw insult bot I tried desperately to find it on the atom store. Would gladly pay money to a protectron to slowly walk to any target of my choosing and insult them.
---
All that new 'gear' will be useless if the junk drops suck even more.
---
Quite awhile ago they changed it so you could only have one
---
The future numbers are clear? That so?
---
I don't know oft any active bugs, but friendslist stuff often can be whacky.
---
Maybe i should reorganize my list as well. I have at least 100-150 guys in there from trades ect. Also im using the chat mod, and its normal there to notify your fellow vault dwellers if you got any high-exp event going on in your server, so ppl can friend each other and come over.
---
There are many ppl i don't rly know in my list lol
---
I'm set up on the acid node south of Wavy Willard's, and I promise you, there are plenty of places you can set up where defense is necessary.
---
Yes, the friend list has always been a buggy mess. I know I have requests waiting to be accepted too as they will flash on screen for a second, then all disappear before i can accept or reject them. I dont know if there is a work around.
---
It's a bit a strange that the Blood Eagles and the Cult of The Mothman weren't added to the pool of possible camp attackers
---
I‚Äôm all for a nerf. But I‚Äôm not down for a neutering. Nah, that‚Äôs taking CBT too far for me.
---
That guy Steve looks like one of those picture of a soldier that went through hell. Can you imagine working on F76 and reading the general beth evil F76 dumpsterfire comments, even on here where the fans are.
---
Edit: from the vid in the post:  [Fallout 76: Inside the vault ‚Äì Daily ops preview](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview)
---
Oh. I never new. Guess im probably not going to move camp anything soon than.
---
Don‚Äôt forget one of the legendary perks is purposely built for bloodied with increased stealth damage
---
if you have a level 3 perk card you get 6 coins, two for each perk point. However, I'm not sure about something like Lone Wander, which required two perk points to equip. so I'm not sure if you get 6 coins for your investment or 8 coins
---
Why would I suck more ? The drop rate for decent start weapons and armour won‚Äôt change just the level it drops at , ever got a half decent weapon or armour at radiation rumble but it‚Äôs been level locked at 40 or worse the forrest event where you kill 3 wolves and get 3 legendaries but there all level 10 or something ?
---
That would be awesome, what's your psn name ill add you
---
Yeah that makes sense , its pretty much a skin for the Fusion generator
---
Well... Yeah. It‚Äôs clear to me and if you didn‚Äôt see the breakdown or it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to you, I can try and explain it in a different way.
---
PS4 also coudn't do it
---
Found the griefer.
---
&gt; It's not coming in this update but it's been confirmed by one of the reps that they're still moving forward with revamping eating and drinking to remove the negative effects and focusing just on the buffs
---
This is why it's my last slot,  by the time that patch hits I should be working on perk card 4 or 5 on the list (I level slow).  At that point I can hopefully look at the changes made and decide if I want that or leg. Intelligence.  (Who knows, maybe well fed will get buffed to being super strong, or maybe speed demon needs some % of food/water to work as a balance change)
---
If the changes make me wanna keep it, cool il rank it, if they make me wanna swap I'm only down 1 perk coin
---
Dude you are way too chill about this. You haven't "learned your lesson". You need to make Bethesda learn theirs. They've literally stolen $100 from you, do not just accept that.
---
Threaten to contact the relevant authorities in a new ticket and that should kickstart them into action. If they fail to act, then follow through with your threat.
---
Exploit / cheat. Report him with pictures of the machines.
---
It's a glitch/exploit. It also permanently ruins your camp budget. You should probably drop the name from your post now you know.
---
Agreed, can easily fast travel out to the same camp or your own. 
---
It annoys me because we have these lovely secret fireplace doors but it‚Äôs pretty obvious where the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù is when rose leaves the door open all day...
---
If you‚Äôre talking amount then ammunition factories that are inside the workshops then yes, you can blueprint them and place them in your camp. Should you? Well that part is more controversial lol
---
It‚Äôs not though. For me it‚Äôs a kill other players and make them salty game.
---
Super annoying! Thw workaround i found is doing it on a private server. If you need one Ive got the service for it, message me.
---
If you say you are willing to pay caps to do so then why not just remove as many mutations as needed to get rid of the one you don't want and then go buy the serums for 300-400 caps from a vendor. Put on starched genes and never worry again. One time investment as long as you don't remove starched genes.
---
Hope so.
---
You can always just pick up the card again when you level up
---
Why drop his name if he's exploiting shouldnt bethesda know his name?
---
Earlephant?
---
Definitely a griefer.
---
I agree completely with this. I have a pretty standard CAMP/workshop loadout, my usual walking-around one is for shotguns, and I have a heavy guns one for stuff like SBQ and Earle. It would be great to be able to set them and forget them; I'd only have to move things around if I need to pick a lock or hack a terminal, because I don't have those enabled all the time.
---
True but this Reddit isn't Bethesda and this Reddit has a rule against witch hunting.
---
Well it was, it won't be very good tomorrow as melee is getting hit HARD by the nerf!
---
naming is not allowed here. It will only get your post removed.
---
Also, this is an unaffiliated forum and to bring him to Beth's attention, you need a video and file a report with Beth. 
---
Naming here does nothing.
---
Tenderizer gives you just 7% at rank 3. It is generally aknowledged  that you don't waste 2 more points from its base value.
---
How is it witch hunting if hes legit doing something not allowed on the game and I'm pointing it out? Just curious
---
Here upvote because you got down voted even tho you're right.
---
That card is a 2* in it's base form. There is no 1*.
---
An no, you can not choose to remove a level from a card. You either scrap the whole card or you keep it as it is.
---
No vending, no allies/turrets etc, concealed, silent and miles from anyone/anything. 
---
If I can swap solar for the vault tec generators it'll be very realistic.
---
Adding on to existing towns would be nice , or red rocket gas stations, would like to see the option of adding vehicles to your camp, some gas pumps etc , I bought a red rocket but it looks crap without the accessories ..  some walls with store sized windows or openings , give us something interesting for a change.
---
Yes I know that. But tenderizer is a multiplicative debuff so what you get out of it depends on your overall damage including all other forms of bonus damage. It will be one of if not the only multiplicative perks come tomorrow.
---
You do have a point that 1 point investment for the 5% buff is probably the best bang for your buck. The above bloodied build would get a 15% boost in dmg for that one point. Way better than the three points needed to get the same bonus from bloodied mess.
---
That's exactly what witchhunting is. We are to take your word that the story is true and you're pointing the finger and exposing the players name. 
---
If it wasn't witch hunting surely your post would just ask the same question without dropping a name. 
---
True people who cheat should be reported properly. We're just explaining that you don't do that here and adding a name is against the rules meaning your post could be removed anyway...
---
I tend to play the game solo at a slow pace, so won't it take me an age to get dealt 3 Lone Wanderer cards again via the level up process?
---
The drops are random for the most part outside of quests that give a static drop.  
---
Leader of the Pack is meant for your lower level characters. It's a di** tease into legendary gear. Those never come at higher levels. Almost any legendary is better than standard gear but a 1 star can be better than a 3 star at any level.
---
No No no No.  It's the mole miners at the direction of the reverse vampires who are under the direct supervision of the Rand corporation!
---
Yeah im excited too. But also the dailys gonna start again tomorrow, so it also feels a bit like the last day of summer break.
---
I too look forward to my weapons doing \~2/3rd of the the damage they currently do while at the same time the monsters remain bullet sponges.  
---
While we're at it, man, I love rewarding the developers not doing their job properly. Instead of making better environmental changes, upping the AI of the enemies, and perhaps examining balance; the devs get cheered because they dropped damage. This makes already non-competitive weapons, even less competitive - wow, just like christmas!!!!  
---
They still can't fix the fast travel bug (around since BETA), or keep my server stable, or delivered on the promises made about FO1, but sure, no way they mess this up.  
---
I can see your analogy working if you meant you were anticipating Uncle Mark drinking too much at lunch then going on an anti-immigration rant all afternoon. Otherwise you're cheering mediocrity.
---
Lone Wanderer is a 1-rank 2-point cost card. If you only want a version that uses 3 perk points to equip, then get two of the basic versions and merge them. That will be two level ups.
---
As far as ‚Äòbreaking down‚Äô cards, I haven‚Äôt heard any talk about that.
---
Shame they nerfed the nuke zone enemy spawns to the point that I can't get enough stabalising materials anymore...
---
Sneak, escape artist, barbarian, Dodgy, serendipity
---
I believe you start it by reading posters for the armour on bill boards and sandwich boards and the like
---
I think you might be transitioning into a mole miner my bro
---
Yes, they don‚Äôt stack so each is tracked separately.
---
Watched some dude get mad at her this morning.  Gave her the thumbs down emote and then started blasting her in the face with an lmg.  For fun I PA clipped behind her counter and shanked her, and then he joined me a few seconds later.  It was a pretty funny encounter.
---
Like an idiot I went ahead and bought a three star from her after seeing his reaction and got a missile launcher.  Probably should have seen that coming but it was reduced weight at least until I can scrip it.
---
No sneak card needed if using full Unyield gear.
---
Okey dokey thanks
---
I have a nice, cozy spot at the pond in front of the Charleston station. Usually pretty quiet &amp; I can farm water and produce, then hop across the pond and sell to the robot vendor. Nice location, as it's a good distance from Vault 76, so I can either fast travel for free to my camp or the vault, options that put me close to many spots I need to visit.
---
I was able to add a full gunsmith card with the addition of the legendary intelligence card, so I gained a lot of weapon durability.
---
If you‚Äôre already running heavy guns, which I know you are, it takes an extra 2-3 bullets to kill standard enemies.  I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll notice much of a difference unless you‚Äôre using a legacy weapon.  Those might break towards the end of a Daily Op thats going badly if you‚Äôre pulling all the weight.
---
I'm excited for the extra xp and always getting max level legendaries, but not for the damage nerf. I think they should've buffed some weapons before releasing 1WL, but that's just my opinion. I think casual players running around with non-meta builds are going to be in for a rude awakening. I don't mean that as an insult either. There's definitely people out there that just boot up 76 once and awhile and run around with a hunting rifle and they're going to be like, what happened? Everything's stronger and I'm weaker.

The ammunition factory? You‚Äôre able to blueprint it. Not sure if it‚Äôs legal or not. You can‚Äôt blueprint the fusion core maker. I‚Äôd like to think that since you‚Äôre able to blueprint it once you have control of a workshop that it‚Äôs ok, but with what we know of all the different exploits I‚Äôm inclined to believe that we shouldn‚Äôt have them. But if you can keep control of the workshop you can make ammo all day. Who knows. It‚Äôd be nice if we could get the fusion core maker though.
---
Worth a try.  Just wait for her to land and aim at her head.
---
With heavy gunner, stabilized, psychotats, and ballistic bock, I get like 48+ damage per shot with my bloodied tribarrel gauss minigun on a headshot. Much more if I'm using magazines and bobbleheads too.
---
The hunting rifle used to be good enough, but nope rifles, pistols and melee have been hit the hardest in this nerf!
---
I do feel like one wasteland makes it harder for bloodied players though, so i do see myself switching to a junkies build :)
---
I guess I‚Äôm not as thankful for things I should‚Äôve had in a game I already paid for as you are. Lol and how does that relate? I should‚Äôve had a dog growing up but I‚Äôm thankful I got three now.
---
I pity them as well, so desperate for this new update like it's gonna be more than 2 quests.
---
Yea this thing is fun as fuck... Any mods I should apply? Just have powerful automatic and suppressed now...
---
I don‚Äôt make trap bases. I don‚Äôt steal junk unless they started it. I don‚Äôt use exploits to kill people and destroy their bases. I‚Äôm far from a griefer, but I can show you what a griefer *really* is if you like.

---
Yeah that is true and will hurt those players , a little love somewhere soon to underperforming weapons and builds would be appreciated , hopefully if the damage calculations is easier for bethesda to handle it will be easier for them to buff those a little
---
Oh god, do I wish. Give her a different paint job, throw some saddlebags on her, and never have to worry about gas again.
---
Is the game still deleted? It better be.
---
Not even log out and log in. Found just go back to base, repair weapons and armour, replenish ammo and rad away. Go back, blow up the cars and more do spawn, just not at the same rate but it is repeatable.
---
I recommend everyone have two accounts. The second account does not need to be Fallout 1st, just a place to have alts where you can dump things or transfer things to other characters on your main account. It's fairly easy to set up with a shortcut to launch the second client. It's also helpful when you want to play alone, but still have group buffs. I almost never play just one character now; both accounts are always online, with one in the background giving the other buffs.
---
Understood completely
---
My int is at 14 so I won't be able to up it. I am using heavys, how'd you know? I can run legacys or non legacys. Will have to see which is working best when I can get in there 
---
I'll probably end up running it with and without and see how it goes.
---
True and hopefully if all enemies scale to individual charachters then so will leader of the pack legendary drops ?
---
Bros before hoes
---
Fixed in next patch
---
Had this once. Some lvl 200+ (I was a little over 100) took over my Workshop while I was in the area. I went there to take a look and when I saw his level I immediately turned around and left without engaging. I was doing one of the challenges to get 10 workshops so I fast travelled to another one and started taking it. Then all of a sudden the thingy said "Contested" and before I know it the lvl 200+ dude one-shots me with something. So I say fuck it and go to a different workshop. Same story. This time I tried to stick around a bit to see if he left but he was waiting for me and kept one-shotting me. One of my team mates probably saw me dying all the time and fast travelled to me. The lvl 200+ dude completely ignored him but just kept killing me whenever I appeared.
---
Luckily I got the guy's username so I send him a message asking why he kept killing me and explaining I'm just trying to do the challenge. He said sorry. I asked him if he was actively following me to which he said yes. Told him that was a dick move and if he wants to use his god tier damage build for something he should just launch a nuke on the Queen so the entire server can have some fun. He gave me a thumbs up and left the server.
---
I got a little pissed off about it but I'm glad he admitted to what he was doing and he didn't bother me again after that.
---
Nope i just stored it cause i already have that mutations and now its gone
---
Yeah but they should be a bit more challenging at least though if I only had an hour to play that day  I just jumped round all the quick low levels events , it wasn‚Äôt fun , it was challenging it was just business. and I will miss that sometimes
---
Second the "always buggy mess". My best bet at getting to those pending friend requests has so far been to join a public team with someone else in it (creating your own public team doesn't seem to work). This often - but far from always - makes the pending friend requests show up for long enough to deal with at least a few of them.
---
Thanks but I have more of everything than I know how to use, except of course for the things that are time gated.
---
&gt; In a workshop implies you want to fight, especially as it‚Äôs far quicker and easier to farm most of these resources another way.
---
Or it implies you're doing a challenge where you have to take over a workshop
---
You just need to put an accelerated barrel on it to get the fire rate over 200.
---
But that was just limited specific weapons, this is affecting all weapons.
---
I suppose it depends on how you class biggest
---
You do know you can choose any perk when you level up, it doesn't need to be a perk from the SPECIAL stat you leveled up.
---
It shouldn't take you that long to level up 3 times. Do you have bodyguards? I know its not the same but you can use bodyguards with a public builders team for the time being. You could also just not scrap that card
---
true , I disagree with some of what you said but üëè you say it so well and your last sentence was brilliant. üòÇ Have a great day my friend üëç
---
I'll translate
---
"Oh, I never knew. Guess I'm probably not going to move camp anytime soon then" :-)
---
Idk what to tell you , for me personally I don‚Äôt worried about cap because it pointless.  When it come to trading I usually trade resource or ammo
---
Or just redo camp placement rules, because largely they are shit.
---
Boy, *do they* stink.
---
I don't know about you, but they sink into the walls every time I try to place them.
---
Thankfully they're supposed to fix it in the new patch Tuesday.
---
Right, I agree, but if it'll be as easy as they say shouldn't they have buffed \*some\* things beforehand? For example, we all know missile launchers are trash. So even giving them a moderate buff with 1WL dropping so we have some different weapons to test out would've been fun. Instead we're all just being dropped in with an overall damage nerf and no weapon buffs which to me, isn't as fun. Hopefully, by the next patch we'll see some weapon buffs.
---
sounds about right. Just did my last hurrah and spent close to 2000 scrip. Got nothing worth while. Maybe 1 item of the 35+ that could be sold for a few thousand caps. Rest were scrip fodder.
---
PU, Plushies units.  
---
Someone posted a picture of them with 500 plushies surrounding them, that maxed out their budget.  
---
so 500 x 20 = 10,000 PU.
---
I get decent stuff occasionally, just not stuff that I can/want to use.
---
Yesterday I got a BE50DR Lever Action Rifle. I run a stealth sniper build, so it wasn't useful to me, but I sold it for 20k caps within 10 minutes in my vendor machine.
---
Still an implied challenge to anyone who‚Äôs on the server, particularly if you stick around.
---
Why were 3/4th of the weapons in game useless essentially since launch?
---
15-30 fps smh. Here's to hoping it's more playable on PS5, but I'm not expecting much from 76 on that.
---
It's hard enough to play even with 6 friends hopping on.
---
Weekly focus as opposed to daily focus for the games system would really make the whole experience better.  But they want those daily log in numbers, soo....
---
They patch the armor bug that caused magic effect for any weapon but have not patched the weapon associated effects that cause magic. However, they could sneak something into the patch that wasn't on the pts. I guess we all find out tomorrow.
---
I don't think max charisma is really that useful. I'd use 9 points at most. 
---
I'm planning to have 6 points in charisma for my bloodied power armor tank build once legendary perks come out tomorrow (I'm moving a few points from another stat). I plan to use 3\* suppressor, 1\* tenderizer, 1\*strange in numbers, and 1\* Team Medic.
---
I'll share team medic so that my teammates all heal me when they heal themselves, which will help support my bloodied build.
---
Sorry I have no idea lol
---
that's incredibly kind of you - however i tried the workaround using my main account which has 1st and still couldn't get past it. mostly just resigned to waiting but it's not that big of a deal, just want to get on and do, you know?
---
I have the same issue, waiting for the patch x)
---
XBOOOONNNNNNEEEE, OH YEEEEAAAAHHHH
---
You know how much hearing that actually blows? Like, I've seen some grind in games like FFXIV and to a lesser extent Destiny, but that's completely ridiculous.
---
Sucks enough that the scrip/cap limit is barely anything in the first place on top of that.
---
Just from the small data I gathered, it looks like they were mostly based off of categories; Floor Decor 20, Lights 40, Generators 40, turrets and Misc items start to have more a more customized cost structure.
---
Gee if only paige had someone smart enough to repair piping for a nuke silo, raid a massive vault, and take down a giant bat and wendigo.
---
I'll guess that'll never happen
---
Only turned in 500 and on last one got a bloodied fixer with 35% vat 25% vat
---
Yeah, it's crazy.  
---
I got the Thanksgiving display and each item place on the shelf is 20 each. So a stocked shelve is 80. Not sure about the comic racks, if those are 20 per magazine.
---
Hmm, that's odd.
---
Ahh ok and only time will tell.
---
Watoga has like 3 spots though its a rmg btwn t60 t51 and idk
---
The cards are worth 2 perk coins per card rank;)
---
try to check here https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/builds/?filter-special=s&amp;filter-special-operator=eq&amp;filter-special-value=15&amp;filter-perks=1009
---
'bout time already
---
Not looking forward to choosing 300 perk cards and then scrapping them all lol May be more than that not 100% sure how many lvls i got saved up on all my toons. Will be nice to not get "pick a cars or move a point" every time i got to swap out perk cards.
---
Yeah it was an incredibly lazy way for them to do it and they chose the easiest way for them . I once dropped an instigating Farman and couldn‚Äôt believe how little damage it did - cmon  a double damage small nuclear device should obliterateüòÇ
---
more bugs than we already have, lol
---
Why are most perks alphabetical but others suddenly not?
---
- Stash increase from 400 to 800. 
---
- The ability to trade legendary gear for scrip. 
---
- Consolidating the 7x200 cap pools into a shared 1400 cap pool. 
---
- Being able to see that I already ‚Äò(Know)‚Äô a plan. 
---
The last one is the only one that I feel should have been available at launch. The rest could have stayed and been justified as ‚Äòimmersion and realism‚Äô or ‚Äògame balance‚Äô.
---
Exactly and I bet there wonderful, I‚Äôve only got one because my wife‚Äôs a meany üòÅ
---
I actually had an idea for having "Allied Mole Miners". Essentially these would be a new group of Mole Miners who had upgraded filters and dusters with a Rusty Pick logo on their backs. We would go to a quarry that would be newly added to the Ash Heap and provide protection for them from "Rival" mole miner mining crews. At the end of the event "The Foreman", a pre-war Sentry bot with Mr. Gutsy styled voice and cigar stuffed in his helmet's vent, would show up with strike breakers and try to attack you and the allied mole miners. They would be a legendary. For beating the event you'd have the chance of getting the "Auto Axe" plan with mod plans, along with a Mole Miner outfit, Hood/Mask, Backpack resembling the Treasure Hunter's, and several other goodies. Other rewards would include guaranteed Scrip, an assortment of Ore, Stimpacks, and caps.
---
Lol this.
---
(Joshua Graham's .45 Auto Pistol Reloading Intensifies)
---
So can anyone from the PTS tell me if the Sympto-Matic has us step inside of it for an interaction or do we just press some interact button and its done?
---
More bugs, more fuck up for the balance...not feeling optimistic tbh
---
JE LMG worked wo armor
---
Get your blind support for anything they do out of the way, and think it through.  (just thought I would mirror your condescension here)
---
There's really no excuse for them doing this and not doing anything else to balance things.
---
I don't think you'll probably get much argument that a weapon and legendary affix balance was LONNNNNNG overdue, but this is like the worst possible way they could have gone about it.
---
Doing an across the board damage nerf (at the same time as a monster buff, no less) after you let the problem go so long that almost literally everyone who could has switched to using the broken tactics because why on earth would you not, with no positives for the players, leaving us to just *assume* that a gear/affix balance, (you know, the actual good stuff that would be fun for us to interact with that makes the nerf feel potentially worthwhile, and get us excited to try out new builds and tactics) is coming... some time in the future, while leaving the old overpowered meta as STILL the best option, and we'll just have to deal with it until who knows when?
---
Completely boneheaded.  It should have all be done at once as part of a big balance pass that this game needs badly.
---
Just finished this last night , I noticed the symbol with nothing next to it, I thought it had to be a mistake every thing else has a atom attached .  So I pressed on, for all the work and time , I feel let down to find out nothing in exchange for my  efforts , now since it a bit harder to get atoms  after season 1 and waiting for season 2 to start on Tuesday. It would have been nice for some award.
---
That‚Äôs a horrible idea. 
---
You‚Äôll put your eye out, kid.
---
Agreed. The alien weapons in the other gamea have always been pretty op. Then 76 comes along and you may as well pistol whip them to death with it.
---
I have to send a friend request to myself in order to see friend requests. I've been experiencing this since February.
---
From what I can tell the instanced camps refer to "Instanced Interiors" for our camps. Then again, we haven't seen anything for the feature yet so I am merely speculating. It would be amazing if we could design our own vaults in 76 though.
---
Super excited for it. Ops looks great. Pumped to have enemy's all high level. Not thrilled about the damage change, but will see what happens
---
Little concerned for the damage nurf since i have played the pts. Hoping im not as affected as i think i will be. But really excited for perks since im lvl 385 ive been saving perks and points for 200 lvls just waiting.
---
It is what it is, I'll just might switch main char and get the legacies out.
---
I encountered him only twice since I started playing. First time he insulted the prices I put on my auction items and then this same one that happened to you. Both times I've been tempted to shoot him.
---
Getting ready to play for a bit then potentially rage quit for a while hoping the devs work more on the game/damage balance post-nerf.
---
Or she's using them to get even better weapons and modify those aswell
---
Originally Foundation did have several dailies. Ward's as we all know, another involving retrieving some toy for the kid, and one other one who escapes my memory now.
---
Is PVP mainly a PC thing I never see anyone doing it on Xbox and we can't even do the quantum thing on Xbox cause we don't have hot keys and to use the favourite wheel is a pain in the arse under normal circumstances never mind a fire fight .
---
!RemninMe 1 week
---
My friend those are all Brilliant examples, how did I ever cope with only 400 stash lol,  that jump from station to station was torture and as much as the purveyor hates me right now being able to script and try for legendaries was a fantastic improvement, and hey what about fixer plans dropping from an event and then being able to get legendary ones in game , awesome . And I too know your pain of buying multiple plans I already owned. üëç
---
Can't wait
---
Same
---
Yeah in a week I‚Äôll probably be writing a - why I hate the new changes post üòÇüëç
---
The patch is exactly as we have now in PTS, same nerf :-)
---
Having duplicate plans that I paid for was one of the reasons I made my first alt.
---
No it's gonna be the same I think but with an option to scrap if you have duplicate cards
---
He keeps telling me most people are beautiful on the inside... but I'm just all rads on the inside. ü•∫üòÇ
---
I have reasonable weapons and armor now, nothing amazing but OK, so now only buy legendary modules from the vendor, stocking up on them, I just can't stand the let down from so much scrip rubbish over the months any longer.
---
I‚Äôm really intrigued by the design of the 
---
War Glaive. It looks like a weapon you‚Äôd see in New Vegas being used by Caesar‚Äôs Legion.
---
XB1 and the elusive 2mmEC
---
No. You can have duplicates of cards. In fact, recently they made the change where you can even buy a card when you already have it ‚Äòmaxed‚Äô. 
---
For example, if you had First Aid at all three ranks, you couldn‚Äôt buy a First Aid card. Or if you have Percepti-bobble already, you couldn‚Äôt buy it (since it only had one rank). But now you can.
---
Yea, though I may walk through the rads of the Cranberry Bog, I will fear no creature: for my Power Armor protects me. My bloodied gauss minigun and plasma caster, they comfort me.
---
I‚Äôve learned to use the favourites wheel effectively even under fire. And I‚Äôm on Xbox. Did a 7v1 after Encyptid yesterday, because someone shot me, I accidentally killed them and everyone went apeshit and started shooting me so I killed them all. It was damn difficult with seven on my back, and for every kill I got I died twice by legacies until people started leaving because they were bored. When it whittled down to 5v1, I started getting the upper hand and two more left because at that point I was just cap farming. If you want to fight at some point, add me on BlackClock69#660.
---
Yo, thanks man! Would have missed it without this!
---
Max out Charisma, just so then you can be The Hooker with the Heart of Gold.
---
This is what I have . I'm sure you'll rip it a new one but lol.. [perks ](http://imgur.com/gallery/psrd7d1)
---
Oh yeah there's that too, you literally can't actually equip all the pistol perks. 
---
Moving Packin' Light over to strength where the other perks of it's type are and putting Modern Renegade over to luck would be a good move.
---
I was thinking that nuke's could spawn Radstorms, and those storms would go in some direction until they left the map.
---
Currently, Radstorms seem kind of pointless since they are not dangerous, and this could give them an origin and purpose.
---
You‚Äôve mentioned vampire and junkie heavies pretty regularly.
---
My luck has been bad too, the best I got was a Furious 3* LMG with 25% FFR and 250 DR while reloading. 
---
I spent 3450 scrip in total, and the rest was absolute, non-debatable hot garbage.
---
What makes it a magic shotgun?
---
Shame the hook got nerfed. Used to count as unarmed
---
I'm not bloodied or Junkies, I lost 150 damage on my weapon, it's an overall perk nerf/damage recalc :-)
---
Lol I never pay attention enough to people's tags on here to notice something like that. I do like to spread my build around when people are asking though haha
---
I have three characters,main,mid,mule...
---
My process has been scrip wit main,roll,keep what‚Äôs good for his build,tranfer to mid,repeat,&amp; then transfer too the mule for storage/selling purposes.
---
I‚Äôll occasionally reverse the process If the mid rolls a weapon that would be good for the main...
---
But In the end,my 2 active accounts stay underweight &amp; have decent to great‚Äôish weapons,
---
&amp; my mule is ridiculously over encumbered which is fine,as he‚Äôs literally just storage,or the account I  vend from &amp; just AFK from time too time.
---
Also,I have a habit of reaching out to friends who have helped me along my way,&amp; droppin all my weapons/plans/mods/ammo (things I‚Äôll never use or don‚Äôt fit my builds)into a bag,&amp; letting them go through it &amp; take whatever they want,wether they use it/sell it...don‚Äôt really care.
---
It‚Äôs my way to show appreciation &amp; help my friends who helped me.
---
Yep, same here! We'll see tomorrow if we got the cool new toys, or just socks and underwear.
---
(Of course, as an adult I'd rather have the latter, but work with me here!)
---
It is 100% an overall damage nerf though.
---
150 is nothing.
---
I‚Äôll believe it when it goes live
---
You should be able to. There's a ton of cobalt flux there, just getting the actual materials to drop from the enemy spawns there will depend on how much you can make. The corn that is near the fissure site will turn into cobalt. 
---
You can nuke that area to get the Sons of Dane Compound and that fissure in the same zone. That worked pretty well, because the glowing ghouls respawn fast plus you can call all of the scorched  with the ultracite nodes there.
---
Your best bet, hop servers until you find somewhere that's nuked, go in that zone to get enough hi-rad fluids, glowing mass, etc. Then you can nuke that region and get whatever else you need.
---
I just want the solar panels. Lol. 
---
Maybe the symptomatic.
---
Good to know I was worried they botched this and we'd only get 2perk coins for those multi star cards.  I am hesitant to get rid of my multiple cards though.  It's what allows me to have flexibility in my build.  I hope they revisit the perk cards at some point and let us break them down and rebuild them as needed, that way we wouldn't need that 5point card to create items and also have a 3 point card to keep our weapons from breaking.  It's taking me over two hundred levels to get the multiple cards to give me flexibility.  I don't always run with 5 demolition loaded but there was a time when it was amazing but for general running a 3 is enough.  Just an example.
---
Still counts as unarmed. It use to Count for both unarmed and 1h. That bug was fixed
---
Have you even researched the nerf or are you just looking for attention?
---
I was just thinking last night that it would be cool if rad storms could cause glowing enemies too
---
They have it set to stun.
---
It's a nerf, bloodied and Junkies were effected more, but that doesn't change the fact everything was effected that used perk cards etc to buff damage.
---
Why are you suggesting otherwise?
---
+1 to this
---
It does the same, one of the grenades will hit it's target in VATS, and the other one is off elsewhere.  I used it for a long time, it was effective about 40% of the time.
---
I've kind of thought the same.
---
None I've been doing it with every level so I wouldn't have to do that when this finally dropped
---
Reminds me of Zingbot.
---
That worked out not as well as I hoped lol
---
She one shot swiped me 3 times haha
---
Some people disagree with me so much they downvoted you!   
---
Sorry to drop your Karma man.  (I upvoted you at least)
---
I get where you're coming from, I just don't have the same amount of faith that you do that this will improve things.
---
Such as small change in Bethesda‚Äôs part but so appreciated, I know most of them now and it would be a nightmare if it hadn‚Äôt been changed
---
I kinda see this as a transition patch. One wasteland is an important addition to the game. It makes many events and locations viable for all players which is a huge addition. I'm guessing this weapon balance pass has something to do with one wasteland functioning and Bethesda themselves have said that balancing will be easier moving forward, therefore I'm confident if buffs are needed to be done they will do it and we may even see other prefixes get some love.
---
It astonishes me time and again that people like yourself don't recognize or care that you write like a toddler who had his pacifier taken from him.
---
Whatever happening Tuesday
---
I‚Äôve said 80 level ups and about 20 perk card packs for tomorrow. I am pretty confident that I won‚Äôt need to change build but I‚Äôm going to wait until tomorrow to see if my guns work with the nerf and my build
---
The best way to resolve is both sides send a request to each other, that auto accepts the invisible pending request.
---
Very excited. The whole map is now viable for everyone from low levels to high. New farming routes and scaled loot üôÇ
---
I remember Insult bot made a mom joke at my friend who lost his mother not long ago. That bot never made it out alive.
---
Ahhhh but YouTube don‚Äôt pay for brevity.  Gotta get those adverts in, there for need 12 minute video for 40 seconds of useful intel.
---
I wish they would make the limits bigger, half of my stash box Is just filled with three-star legendaries that I can't sell because that's 40 script that I could be using.
---
Basically, anything non-automatic is getting hurt. I haven't tested my build yet with the damage nerfs, but I still think I'll be fine. Even if I'm not one-shotting things, as long as I can kill stuff before it kills me I'm happy.
---
Leave me ur discord name ill add you my self :)
---
You can see already how everybody who knows whats happening is trying to trade for tse, quad, aa and vampire.
---
Counterpoint, players with unoptimized builds will be hit the least, if at all. The damage numbers haven't changed, only the way they stack so if you aren't stacking any bonuses....
---
And that puts it so well , as an adult I will appreciate the difficulty, changes and challenges which will prolong my enjoyment of the game but if I‚Äôm honest the kid in me does sometimes enjoy running around with my overpowered op bang bangs making a lot of noice and mess and leaving a trail of destruction in my  path üòÅ
---
I'm also excited to have a reason to explore the whole map again. It gets boring going to the same places. Also daily ops!
---
Strangely, the past month or so I have been visited by the insult bot daily (or nearly so) - sometimes a couple of times a day.  Previously - would only rarely see him.
---
That's a good thing, game has gotten stale, stirs it up a bit..
---
Hey who cares about karma I got enough good vibes to go along , sending you some good vibes now üëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëç
---
I can accept this perspective, but it doesnt change what I‚Äòm saying.
---
taming as a few strict things you need
---
1. animal friend
---
2. wastland whisperer
---
3. to be higher lvl than the animal
---
4. it has to be a animal from a ‚Äòset‚Äô spawn
---
What do you mean "buy"? Did they add something like using saved perk points to "buy" a card like NW Overseer Tickets? Or do you mean the part where they fixed the bug where duplicate cards vanished?
---
Instead, they could add a spawn point marker and only allow it to be placed outside of the buildable camp circle.
---
Except what you're saying is both from a bias viewpoint and factually incorrect. Everyone who boosts damage is effected to some degree.
---
The photos are linked to the console itself that they were taken on, so if you‚Äôve deleted media data or swapped consoles that might be the cause? Just an idea I‚Äôm probably well off here
---
I've had it happen twice on ps4, once was sort of my own fault, I deleted the game and reinstalled it. The second was because of one the updates a few months ago in the run up to wastelanders.
---
No, I mean select a perk card at level up. Buying it with your level up.
---
Weekly limits would mean people would blow the limit in only 1 day, and then have to wait a whole week for the reset.
---
And then they'd all come here and make posts like this complaining about it.
---
This is the correct answer
---
Lol, it was in the name of science!
---
Like I said, not the most reliable thing and should be treated more like a toy.  It's fun when it works but shouldn't be used as a crutch or having a build based around bugged weapons.
---
They do need a brb emote! Hate wondering if my buddy is afk or got disconnected and i‚Äôm just viewing his player-less toon.
---
Ahh gotcha. Terminology was a bit confusing :) Thank you for clarifying!
---
 I think you also need at least 10 percent budget available in your CAMP
---
I dont understand you, you say yourself that bloodied and junkies is affected most.
---
I was overloaded a couple of days ago so had to slog my way from one end of map to another to get to where my fat assed mule lives and actually really enjoyed the walk and discovered a bed and breakfast where the owners set me up to be eaten by cannibals. Brilliant! Can‚Äôt remember if I had that before but your absolutely right will be nice to get out and about in the map again, plus there will be new (or should I say old) xp farming spots with loads of baddies which were too low level to bother with
---
This, 100% this. Thank God for that legendary perk. That's the first one I'm maxing
---
Every single ‚Äòsale‚Äô is meant to be a scrip drain to keep us grinding not a sweet deal for us to grab. Each time I spend 4-5k across several characters, the drop rate of usable effect is nerfed to nearly nonexistent during the sale. After the sale they will tune them slightly back up. No it‚Äôs not a theory, it‚Äôs a fact.
---
I think there a big issue is that you should be able to choose what ever "flavor" of weapon and armor you want, and they should all have pluses and minuses depending on the type.    
---
Right now there is just no reason not to use whatever gun has the best dps outside of ammo concerns, and there's never any reason to use anything but SS armor outside of the grind to get it.
---
Better get my damn robes though and of maxson order is with robes is what I‚Äôm getting at not field scribes or all the other added on bs just knights and scribes round table style
---
That's the people watching the latest Angry Turtle video, because those were precisely his recommendations. And yes, if he's right then there is something funky going on with TSE and we've come full circle to the TSE meta that ruled the first few months.
---
It is, of course, anybody's guess as to if and when Bethesda will actually produce a balance patch that is worthy of the name. They claim that the new damage calculations are intended to make that easier, and they should. But if, how and when they follow through with that remains to be seen.
---
One of mine took an entire day to reach my camp. Sloth are....well, obviously, slow and these guys TAKE FOR BLOODY EVER to get to camp. Be patient, he's coming...he's just....meandering! Worst case you may have to tame again BUT, give it a bit more time.
---
Yep, still deleted. I gave it a couple of chances but there is a point that it only brings up bad emotions now, so why waste time re-downloading and trying over and over. As they say, "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."
---
I don't even read up on what is going on with Fallout any longer and frankly skip over anything I see. I guess I will be stuck with Fallout 4 VR for the foreseeable future. Only responding to this because it came to my inbox, not any interest in Fallout 76.
---
Where are you getting serums for 300-400 caps? EVERY player vendor I have seen has them at 1k+ usually closer 2.5k, and they are 4k in white springs. Enlighten me please!
---
Isn't everyone stacking bonuses, even un-optimized builds?
---
Correct, that is in keeping with me saying everyone is effected.
---
You're saying it's only a nerf to bloodied and junkies, but it isn't.
---
Therefor, you're' wrong..... what's hard to understand?
---
You‚Äôre a genius, thank you.
---
No worries!
---
Maybe because it spent 25+ years in a chemical laden, toxic puddle?  (Or wherever &gt;!Sofia got the VATS Unknown!&lt;, which looks just as bad.)  I mean, it's looking pretty rough now.
---
That'd be a neat quest: bring the blaster to a tinfoil hat wearer who continually rambles about alien abductions and such.  Turns out he isn't just a kook, and really did spend several months on a Zetan ship before escaping.  If you gain his trust, he teaches you how to restore the blaster to full functionality and how to make blaster ammo.  (Probably on par with prime receivers and ultracite ammo in damage boost and ammo costs.)
---
My google-fu is failing me here, but I vaguely remember a mention that the blaster is getting a +30% damage boost in the next patch.  Is that true, or was it just a lie beamed into my brain by the Illuminati's orbital mind control satellites?
---
LOL, xbone...
---
I can't wait for the "we can't do ladders" Easter egg
---
I dont understand that you dont understand that 1000 apples are more than 150 apples...
---
Its about the relative change and it hits bloodied and junkies so hard that it simply is destroyed.
---
The weekly limit is a joke!  I work on a crab boat and can only place a few days a month.  We need a monthly limit!
---
(All kidding aside, I would favor a weekly limit but you are right about the complaints.)
---
This is basically me. I'm so excited for everything *but* how the damage is changed.
---
Hate the size, but no noise is compelling. For whatever reason, the noise of the fusion reactor has been bugging me the past few days.
---
Yeah I have spent about 2k scrip over two characters and haven‚Äôt got any decent prefixes I don‚Äôt think. Had no junkies, no bloodied, no AA that I can remember. Only decent thing I got was a vampires explosive railway, that‚Äôs the pinnacle.
---
No, this is a myth. I am at max budget and tames a Deathclaw yesterday with zero issues.
---
Exactly this. +For these meta builds it's still going to be a resource wasting fest because you take more damage (have to repair more armor) and have to grind the bullet sponges (ammo waste + wpn repair more often)
---
Some costumes I would like to see are a Pharaoh Mummy, Jack O Lantern mask, and a Devil.
---
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. Getting scaled enemies and more importantly, scaled loot, is going to be awesome. I'll be able to run my favorite event and not get level 40 rewards. 
---
I'm not too worried about the so-called nerf as I'm currently a potato build and that has never one-shot anything. I was planning to re-spec just before these changes were announced so I've held off on that. I hope to make a decision on a build soon and just go with it. I am only a little discouraged that I'll be burning through rank ups to re-spec and missing out on legendary perk points but it's not a deal breaker.
---
Some of what the other people posted is wrong or out dated info. You need animal friend 3, wasteland whisperer is never required and a pet takes up zero camp budget. You do need to be higher level, specifically you can tame anything that's half of your current level.
---
You need to find one that spawns alone as a random encounter for it to be tamable so you can send it to your camp. I get all my pets at Cranberry Glade. It will take some server hopping but they always show up there eventually.
---
We need weekly everything.... Limits, challenges everything should be weekly.  if I want to be an adult during the week and then play for 14 hours on the weekend like a child that should be my prerogative.
---
Is it the revive in water one?
---
I'm guessing it was an update, because the same thing happened to me.
---
This was actually dope thank you
---
Bought this as soon as I saw it and immediately started working on a haunted house build.
---
Well, let's agree to disagree.
---
Delicious fresh ingredients, slightly under cooked noodles, too much salt in the sauce
---
Extremely excited to see all these salty people raging over losing a tiny bit of damage
---
It feels more like Christmas Eve with distant relatives that don't really know you.  In theory they mean well but you know you're going to get a bunch of things you don't exactly want like knock off Legos and a putting challenge golf game for a system you don't have.  I have this feeling that it's just going to be one of those situations where you have to be thankful for what you get it's not what you want.
---
&gt;just thought I would mirror your condescension here
---
Probably would be a lot less condescending if I didn't have to read the spammed "wah, muh duped b2525 fixer no longer 1 taps" all the time.
---
As far as "muh nerf goes" I'd rather them do this change and then have the ability to balance with a scalpel instead of a tactical nuke like the TS and explosive (heavy weapon especially) nerfs of the past.
---
They have to be animals at Random Encounter spots. This map [here](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) shows the RED dots which are the best taming location, stick to the Bog and the Mire and Divide for the best animals. You need Rank 3 of Animal Friend, a gun with basic sights so you can aim and tame from a distance. Once tamed, let it run to your camp ALONE. It could take 1 to many hours for it to get there, be patient. The animal must be HALF your level and MUST SPAWN ALONE. If there are ANY other mobs near it, move on. Vertibird up but the compass in the NE, the substation by Berkely Springs and Carnberry Glade are my favorite!
---
Nah just the regular revive
---
I understand that you don't comprehend a single word people say to you, unless it agrees with what you have already decided are the facts.
---
Bloodied remains the strongest build, Junkies is still ok, it may take 2 or 3  shots not one to kill a top level SM, that's it....
---
Have you actually played on PTS?
---
I have only run it 3 times on xbox but no crashes
---
I'd love to help and get you to do the same for me but I'm Xbox D: Is it the scout quest? I've not started it yet for this very reason.
---
My man did you try to capitalize a 1
---
Lol which is it? Stacking bonuses or unoptimized?
---
The player you described would likely have a suite of QOL weight reduction perks, a bunch of charisma and no matching damage cards. Let alone mutations, nerd rage, AR, etc.
---
Are they only available after you hit 50? Like the perk slots are there, you just can't use them till 50.
---
Can‚Äôt stand the let down of scrip fodder from the purveyor so get legendary modules instead to get let down by the scrip fodder of what you craft lol. Why do we punish ourselves so much?
---
Youre wrong sorry. tse is the strongest now, you will see tomorrow.
---
I'm hyped 4 daily ops lol
---
happened to me once.   
---
sneak attacked while building up defenses for the Defend Event.  
---
now i just take over the shop, stash my junk and FT away.
---
Mine's occasionally disappear randomly but return later! Sometimes after a few days. Maybe just a glitch?
---
this is 100% correct.
---
Haha, pure Bethesda right here, the *incoming* friends list doesn't update until you send/recieve/delete a friend.
---
Youll need a revive in water for the swimming badge. Not sure if that counts for both, but if someone is helping you, get both out of the way. Plus you need 3 badges.
---
Are they two of the same machine or is one mothman and the other Halloween? People have said you can still have 2 if they're different types.
---
lol, I'm on PTS right now, my TSE minigun sucks, I am still one shotting nearly everything with my BE laser...you have no idea what you're talking about dude :-)
---
I'm just a little bit lower than that I do 37 with plasma
---
I‚Äôve gotten a lot of explosive Pipe pistols over this sale. IE, JE, AAE, ...TSE. I do believe irony loves fate. i‚Äôm heavy gunner build so getting a bunch of explosive pistols was a good laugh. Thanks rn jesus!
---
I run across them quite often on PC vendors for that price. I have mine priced at 360 each. Once you know the recipes they are fairly easy to craft, so the price essentially comes from the one stable flux each requires
---
I noticed that too, got quite a few explosive pipe revolvers from events
---
limited to one of each type. Mothman and Halloween variants.
---
Thanks. Good to know
---
Try a tse laser with fully perked bloodied build and then youll understand.
---
Travel and Morgantown, morgantown's a good place to grind for lower levels
---
Yep!! Player vendors are definitely the way to go. I got two bloodied lmgs yesterday for less than 800 caps each and a junkies fixer that I paid way too much for but I just had to get it for trade adds.
---
If you don't leave the 'circle of trust' at all as a solo player it is exactly 2-1/2 minutes to boost the repeaters at x1 speed.
---
Yes, the Burrows is terrible solo, and on all levels. It is doable but you cannot afford to get lost even a little and that's tough between the trip from the alpha repeater to the beta and from the beta to the boss staging area (which in the Burrows is the pump room). Not only is it an incomprehensible maze in that area but the bad guys in the boss stage spawn in all sorts of weird areas and it's tough to get them all efficiently and then find and eliminate the boss.
---
The Galleria, The Burning Mine and Vault 94 are all much easier and more straightforward in their layout but even then it'll probably take 4-5 tries for you to memorize the main locations (the beacon, the two repeaters and the boss staging area) and then probably another 4 or 5 times for you to formulate a strategy that works for you (the best route, which beacon to activate first, how not to die, etc.). But I promise you they're all doable, eventually.
---
Psn - hovdogjay
---
Optimized means a near perfect combination of skill, basic builds will be hit less but they‚Äôre still going to feel it.
---
Either way, say goodbye to running SBQ or ACP without an optimized build. Those of us that perfected our builds won‚Äôt be able to handle Earl on-on-one anymore, gl to the players that were relying on us to beat him. Magic weapons are the only route now without a good team to play with.
---
Daily Ops are great, the new gear/camp items are neat, but the sleeper change that I'm excited about is &gt;!the SBQ is cripple-able!!!!&lt;
---
I think the 30% was true but still useless :/  i think in fallout 3 the alien blaster was known for insane critcal damage. Should keep the damage somewhat low but have insane critical attack so it could be used for critical builds
---
Yeaa it's the scout quest, I put it off with the hopes Id stumble across someone needing revived but it never happened lol
---
I'll DM it to ya. I have a couple of stalkers, unfortunately, so I don't post my Discord publicly lol.
---
enter the mine, follow the path to the right to the big room w/ all the crafting benches. Wait for timer and clear wendingos. Rubble clears, Drop down, slaughter earle.
---
Ohh lol cool i understand
---
Next to the food plant in flatwoods nobody goes there but there's a big open flat area with a nice little lake it's next to a bridgeI had to get away from it because nobody bought things from me there Amanda heard the brotherhood was going so I just moved to Atlas
---
Let's be real from a gameplay design point there is no need to have a limit for Gold or Scrip as it can't be traded between characters or players.
---
Just sent a request, cheers man
---
On my way to your world
---
It's more the wheel not working when you want it to mines always slow especially under fire and thank might take you up on it never tried it tbh
---
How are people okay with this damage nerf?? Y‚Äôall are fine with having your builds butchered?? This is an insanely stupid idea I can‚Äôt believe the community is fine with this!!
---
Weekly limits need to go - We need MONTHLY limits at least
---
Its f-ing tedious. Scrip limit is a joke. I tend to play mostly during last week, missing all the weekly scrips. It would be lovely to make it a monthly scrip limit. At least I could done my legendary chores at once. 4500 per month. How hard is it ?  
---
But no, they have to put this ,, pathetic ,, weekly based scrip limit. Even almost 2 years after launch. Just kek.
---
And please, do not argument wih ATShop. I check it once a  month, when there is actualy something new. I simply neglect the idea of weekly loging just because bethesda wants me to check atomic shop.
---
Give us at least **MONTHLY LIMITS.**
---
Thats what gonna happen you guys wil one thing and after that you will want more just like the fucking stash limit I just don't understand one thing , ONE FUCKING THING. Because you can't play it all day it doesn't mean they need to change it Ok so example I can only play one second a year so bethesda need to think about me and make secondly rewards Stop being little brats this fucking game have thousand players If you can't adapt yourself to online real time going thing just stop playing it  nobody need to change their thing because you want it btw don't forget to downvote me Its been a long time since I visit my old friends at hell of reddit that people go against hivemind
---
I'd love to get a BB Gun in this. Would be fun to use.
---
There are in-jokes like this all over the game's generic dialogue lines, the writer definitely browses this subreddit for inspiration, I've seen just too many particular lines for it to be mere coincidence. Wouldn't it be funny if this post somehow got referenced in a passing comment somewhere?
---
Did you delete the game and reinstall? If the answer is yes; then you deleted all your photos
---
They don't need to out-damage rifles, but we could definitely use more variety, such as middle-ground handguns, and a few more heavy hitters.
---
That's the handgun's biggest weakness from Fallout 4 that 76 inherits.  There's just too little variety, and it makes for bad balance, and just bad feedback (how it feels) to players.  When most of your pistols are functionally just single-action revolvers that share the exact same animations, things are going to feel like crap unless you did a good job differentiating them, which they haven't.  As it stands, when it comes to modular weapons like pipe weapons, laser, and plasma, I don't see much reason to choosing their pistol configuration since most of the time they seem inferior that way except in the case with certain pipe weapons, and that's only because you can double dip with rifle and handgun perks which almost seems like a bug.
---
The strength of handguns should primarily be lightweight, including their ammunition, and inherently low AP cost.  Makes sense that a smaller, lighter weapon will probably have a lower AP cost, as has been the trend in the series.
---
But being light doesn't mean they should all have 'light' damage.  That's why we need more middle ground weapons that strike a balance between being light, but hit harder.  A .45 semi-automatic would be a good example of adding a new handgun that has a higher capacity compared to a revolver, and hits harder than a 10mm pistol, but less than the revolvers.
---
Similarly, we could use more power-hitting weapons.  Revolvers will probably always have higher base damage than semi-autos, but at the moment, unless you're double dipping perks, they don't all feel very powerful, especially with the lack of armor-piercing modifications.
---
Adding the .308 conversion to the pipe revolver would probably be a good idea, but we could always use a ballistic counterpart to what the gauss pistol is.  New Vegas had the hunting revolver, and I think that, or something similar that uses a new round like .45-70 would be a good addition.
---
Ah, xbox here, that could be the biggest factor. Smaller player base, higher costs. I Have seen the same phenomenon in other games. Like path of exile.....
---
Good thing, i am about to buy my first serum recipe today. Will not be an issue in a few more weeks.
---
I don't know about the live version but in the PTS I was able to sell all of my duplicate Daily Op _plans_ in the PTS but I was not able to sell any of the merch _made_ from the plans. For instance I could sell the _plan_ for a Vault 94 jumpsuit but I could not sell a Vault 94 jumpsuit. (Which is fine b/c the V94 jumpsuit is identical in every respect to the bog standard V76 jumpsuit.)
---
Nahh, i'ma pack rat when it comes to my games. I havent played breakpoint since launch &amp; I still havent uninstalled it. Fallout 76 I play more, but i'm pretty sure I wont uninstall it unless bethesda kills the servers.
---
I have said this before, they don‚Äôt need to get rid of the limit just give me vouchers so the hundreds and hundreds of weapons I have on my main and 4 alts can be scripped
---
Pharaoh mummy for sure.
---
Get a super sledge and use that for awhile.
---
I'd like to be able to trade with Mumbles to avoid the scrip limit. That is, she accepts legendaries at the same prices that the exchange machine does, so that instead of selling and then buying, you could, say, trade two 3-star legendaries at 40 scrip each + 20 scrip for a 3-star legendary worth 100 scrip or whatever.
---
They could make it so that you couldn't just sell to her (you could still use the exchange machine for that), or even that you can't trade in a way that nets you additional scrip.
---
That was exactly it!
---
When you‚Äôre getting staggered it‚Äôs a little cunt to deal with. And you also freeze up while you‚Äôre being shot at while you have a bounty for some reason.
---
I get this more frequently with guns, which I would say makes more sense(aggro breaking stealth bonuses) but the damage actually dealt when it happens doesn't line up with any multiple I can come up with and instead is completely aberrant(level 1 enemies losing a small percentage of health to weapons they couldn't survive without damage bonuses applied dor example). It seems to me explosive weapons(Broadsider etc) are even more likely to experience it, and flying scorchedbeasts especially. Makes me wonder if it's a netcode thing specifically, but the wholly unpredictable amounts of damage are just bonkers. I'm kinda hoping tomorow's patch improves it somehow, tho not expecting it.
---
Your weapons will do less damage and it will take more ammo/swings to kill things.
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
So...if we've been saving card pack opening...when I do open them after legendary perk cards are released...do we know if we'll get legendaries if they were earned prior to legendary cards were released??? I hope so....I've purposely not opened them in hopes that's the outcome.
---
Everything but the glaive plan is tradable afaik.
---
Tomorrow‚Äôs patch will destroy what‚Äôs left of consensual PvP, you mark my words.
---
Now I'm not the end all know all,  and this is a very basic way of explaining but: 
---
Old formula: 2 √ó 5 = 10 
---
New formula:  2 + 5 = 7
---
Edit: they are only changing the way damage is calculated.
---
I think it's just a novelty weapon, like you should only be bothering with if you're going for the whole sci-fi/alien look, plus they don't want a weapon with only one spawn point to be meta defining or anything. The alien blaster is only there for fun, simple as that.
---
Damage buffs are being changed from a multiplicative buff to an additive buff, making multiple simultaneous buffs weaker
---
And people are complaining that it will take 10 seconds to kill SBQ instead of 7
---
They removed 1 star max cards from perk packs a while ago, but other than those, any other card can be in a perk pack. I played PTS and bought the same card over and over again, just to scrap them. If you have enough saved level ups, you could start off scrapping your entire deck, then buy just the cards you wanted. A risky move, because I know I'd forget something, but it is doable.
---
üòÇ üçª
---
Bad thing is i cant with my job. Only on my nights off. 4 on 2 off 15+hour days including the drive to and from work makes it where im too tired to try and log in for the scrips and stuff each day
---
Pistols are sidearms guys, they support primary weapons and aren't themselves primary forms of damage. Use pistols on weaker or injured foes when your clip runs dry. Remember, switching to your pistol is always faster then reloading.
---
If it were as powerful as it was in other fallout games, everyone would feel compelled to use it and then complain about lack of ammo! It looks sweet, though.
---
*Bloodied builds felt this*
---
As far as we've seen on the PTS, magic weapons haven't been fixed so she'll still die in 7.
---
When did this nerf hit? I was wondering why I was getting a tonne of ionized meats and not much else when I used to be able to craft at least a couple of stable fluxes per nuke. Now I'm lucky if I get 1 High Rad Fluids per nuke.
---
WHERE
---
While I agree with what you are saying and it would be great to have this implemented, my bigger question is why is there this obsession with keeping every legendary item received? I had this mindset for the longest while. I finally had enough and started selling the junk legendaries to vendors(after obtaining 150 scrip.) Once I started doing this it was a burden lifted off my shoulders. Haven‚Äôt had any issues obtaining legendary weapons through gameplay to make my 150 scrip per day and now I don‚Äôt have tons of crap taking up space in my Stash Box.
---
They could just make it so that only the camp owner spawns there and keep the current system for visitors, which is exactly how the mat works in workshops.
---
But it's really bad for your knees!
---
How so?
---
Some time earlier this year, I've given up purifying my own and just farm the SBQ and Earle now! It's actually faster!
---
I see serums for cheap all the time on Xbox.  I can sell the following for 250 caps each: eagle eyes, herbivore, speed demon, and marsupial.
---
I've been using Quad Single Action .44s for over a year now, I think.  They're fun in niche ways, but it'd be nice if they had more mods and did more damage.  I'm stubbornly sticking to my guns here (heh, I'm a funny guy) but I think ALL pistols need some help here.   
---
I still have a dream of dual wielding my two quad single actions.
---
Why not group for them?  I am not big on groups, but you can blow through the missions in 5-6 minutes with a full group and don't really have to interact much.
---
My stuff wasn‚Äôt amazing but I was getting almost all explosive weapons. I‚Äôm now a firm believer that the server dictates drops to an extent, as literally 50%+ were explosives
---
Not quite. 
---
Current. 3 +20% sources went x1.2, x1.2, x1.2 giving you +66%
---
New +20%x3 equals +60%
---
I wanted to point out that the plan is actually called: Plan: Scavenged Solar Panel, not Plan: Solar Panels
---
Cheers!
---
She gave me a mutant handmade and combat rifle for my level 20 so its ok.got nothing but scrip stash on my main. Does anti armor work on energy? Got a nice plasma gat but its aa
---
Not at all excited but my interest in 76 has been dying as of late. I don‚Äôt see anything about this update that‚Äôs gonna make me log on and play.
---
Daily Ops are going to be fun, but I'll miss being able to visit low level areas and kill things using weapons I'm not properly specc'd to use.  That three star combat knife is pretty useless with my build in the Bog, but it's aces against level five Scorched at Poseidon.
---
Oh, gooooood, I found you.
---
BLAM right in the kisser.
---
Then complaining about the nerd is even more stupid, reality is it had to happen. The old formula would be hard to balance and the end game content was just too easy for a PVE focused game.
---
In the days when they wanted their PVP live service such a formula makes sense in competitive setting but in one where everybody just wants to kill bosses and get loot it sucks.
---
Bethesda though shouldn't have promised to tweak it, they should of just gone "look, this should have been fixed earlier but this way characters are at least a bit more balanced"
---
Though my view personally? Get rid of Legendaries, make us rely on perk cards that we can't just swap around on the fly.
---
Then spend time making some ignored weapons and builds more advantageous so you don't just have a bunch of Commandos running around.
---
&gt; and ate about 100 5mm.
---
Are they that tough?
---
This would be beautyful, but after 1,5 years of playing I don't believe they will buff anything. IMHO, they will take a short look on it an say "It just works."
---
I have run it about 15-20 times with no crashes on a normal Xbox One.
---
I'll keep an eye open for the new ops groups for sure, just otherwise I'm a solo flyer as I'm last man standing from the group I was part of.
---
Overkilleded.
---
I wish that it worked like the settler and raider battle encounters did.
---
You find the mole miner being attacked by *enemy*, you help them by fending off the attack, speak to them, then they award you with a random pail as a thank you. Then the audio distress signal they produce stops.
---
Killing them should place a bounty on the player!
---
The current killing system feels terrible, I didn't even bother last time because it felt like such a bad karma decision.
---
Master slugger 2 and no Expert slugger makes no sense. You're basically leaving +5% damage bonus on the table.
---
Same too with Shotgunner 3 except you leave 10% on the table for no good reason. Better to go 1 each level than get 3 in one card.
---
If you care about carry weight (I presume the reason you chose thru-hiker) drop or reduce thru-hiker and add Radicool to END. The +STR helps BOTH carry weight and bonus melee damage. 
---
If you need something to do with the extra agility, either go more adrenaline or get some enforcer for shotgun. It's a mean AF perk. Good for crippling ghouls.
---
Otherwise no comment beyond that.
---
what astonishes me is the level of aggression people here have towards different opinions.
---
&gt; without a good team to play with.
---
I feel like this is kinda the point.
---
It is, after all, a *multiplayer* game. Content intended for teams(i.e impossible or at least ludicrously difficult to solo) kinda fits the bill.
---
And yet people continue to complain about things not working right in the game. Go figure.
---
Dual wielding.
---
On ps4 and selling my serums for 299 and not a penny more
---
I have those on for when I switch to melee..thru is on for carry weight yep. Everything else is pretty much ok then ?
---
The war glaive is disappointingly only OK.
---
I mean it looks pretty sweet and the and if you put a plasma blade on it it makes a very satisfying light saber-esque "whoove-whoove" sound. And it is one of the better 2-handed melee weapons doing slightly less damage stock than a standard Grognak's Axe.
---
BUT
---
Unlike most of the new weapons from Wastelanders it's not craftable as legendary and can only be acquired as legendary from the purveyor's loot pool (and events that reward from that loot pool). And while there's a sweet selection of blades to be had from Reg in Vault 79, all the blades are elemental in nature (cryo, flaming, plasma, shock) and instead of supplementing the already pretty good damage it _halves_ the melee base damage and then adds in a ton of elemental damage.
---
In my case with full sluggers the base glaive did ~200 damage but adding a plasma blade downgraded the base damage to ~100 and added ~113 shock damage and occasionally gooified enemies. Similar #s for cryo, shock and flaming. And while that might be fine for some folks, a number of enemies, supermutants in particular, have extraordinary elemental resistance far above their regular armor resistance making the modified glaive much less useful against them.
---
Oh I agree! It gives the games a lot of longevity and replayability
---
Just curious, do they still have that one spot behind Morgantown Station where you can always get some Raw Yellowcake flux?
---
In case you're unaware. Just behind the station (the side not facing the airport) there's a tree(if I recall correctly) and around this tree there always at least one Radodenron(or however it's spelled) and you can always get some raw Yellowcake flux from it, granted not enough do do any good and Yellowcake flux is perhaps the most common flux in the game, but it's still kinda cool. I haven't been to Morgantown Station in months  so I don't know if they've removed this from the game, but it had been there since BETA.
---
EDIT: I feel I should add in case I wasn't clear enough, this spawn is/was always there even if the area hasn't been nuked.
---
That‚Äôs why all novels from the 1800s are really long, the publishers paid by the word.
---
She's a robot lover in Watoga. Long dialog chain. She even talks about the mayor for a day quest
---
But your quest is listed as "help team leader".  You do not have a map marker showing where team leader needs to go, or the name of the quest.
---
I always kill the prize bot, cuz fuck him for giving me garbage... but insult bot? He gets the bullets.  Anyways overkillesed
---
I had better luck than normal, a B/FFR/25Vats lever and a B/E/50 10mm pistol. Couple of others I can sell in my vendor and a ton of scrip
---
On PTS as a stealth build I was able to participate and contribute with a team to get the max rank without issue. Sure the first few times are tough, but once people figure them out they become mundane.
---
It‚Äôll take a bit before Angry Turtle figures out how it all works. But it looks like explosive damage is more powerful now also.
---
I dismantled last one that just gave me 100 pre-war money. Since cloth was used for ATLAS, I almost regretted turning him into scrap.
---
Not sure if next one is gonna face the fate of previous ones.
---
No it‚Äôs always been 120 I think can‚Äôt remember it being lower
---
It would be nice, but it will not happen.
---
At a max of 10-15 points of DR per perk point, evasive and ironclad are not very good investments. The percent reduction perks like dodgy or blocker work much better, but one has an AP cost and the other is melee only so i don't know if they'll work for you. Fireproof is pretty effective and useful if you still want to have high endurance.
---
People usually take bloody mess for an extra 15% damage. I haven't tried luck of the draw but running gunsmith always seems to be enough.
---
It looks like it's based off of ancient Chinese polearms specifically, the head shown in the image above is a ji and the other I can identify is a pudao.
---
So it's a commie weapon, which is strange for the BoS but okay lol.
---
I totally would but I have no clue what I would do if I actually got to that point. I've honestly gotten used to being screwed out of my money for purchases made online. It's happened ALOT. That's usually why I buy the prepaid cards. That way they at least don't have my card information
---
So are bloodied weapons useless now?
---
The "Walk it off" is the best.  It totally saved his metal ass one night.
---
Nope. You're lying. Only the friend active **main** quest would be displayed on your screen which would take only one or two lines.
---
Weird... my carry weight has been at 345 and now its 405. Oh well dont look a gift horse in the mouth. Thanks for letting me know. I guess I was crazy
---
Gear degradation is slowed in the new daily ops :)
---
The standard one holds 60, so the high cap adds 60 more.   Should have been that way since wastelanders at least.
---
Pro tip: Break this bad boy out during the Daily Ops challenges and yawn as your enemies disintegrate literally before you know they're there :)
---
I'm not sure, although the fissure prime area has like 1 cobalt flux, so it's pretty annoying when that's useless. It gets stale when people always target the exact same spot.
---
The game needs some large scale randomizer.
---
Who remembers the Bat from Adventure?
---
I'm also interested to hear if that's the case.
---
Ben askren is everyone's inspiration
---
Are you confusing "+60" with "60" perhaps? Brains do that kind of annoying thing at times and make us feel stoopid. Kill it with some alcohol (unless you're not old enough in your local area) as punishment at the next reasonable evening to do so.
---
Season 2, which means more XP grinding.
---
Possibly Event grinding too, if they ever fix that other repeatable weekly.
---
But...but...what will I complain about?? OH! Wait! All new exciting and exotic bugs are about to arrive!! I feel ya' man, I really do lol
---
I'm on PS4 and get that bug occasionally. Most of the time it's either on spawn after fast travelling, or when I'm using VATS with a melee weapon. 
---
Screen is working fine, flashes to black with a click sound in my headphones, then I'm stuck with a mostly black screen with the UI still visible. Fast travel doesn't help. Switching toons doesn't help. Gotta reload the game to fix. 
---
Been playing 76 for a year now and it has happened on average maybe once a month. Some patches seem to fix it, but other patches make it happen more frequently.
---
Real life is definitely more important but it still sucks, some fun and relaxation is good for the soul.
---
I mean there are weekly challenges.
---
Things do happen if there is support and enthusiasm.  Many suggestions here have come true, like the no mic emote that I and others suggested a long time ago.
---

---
Just took it off and put it on again... haven't done that in about 6 months. Maybe it reset? Thanks
---
Seeing as there are perks for solo‚Äôing and they specifically prefaced this entire game with us still being able to enjoy the game just as well without teams, that‚Äôs just not true.
---
Despite that though, it was a small part of what I had said. Unoptimized builds already do very little for endgame content. They‚Äôll be worth nothing in a boss fight and now optimized builds can‚Äôt carry those players like we have been up to now. The game‚Äôs no longer supporting build diversity and Beth is simplifying it to nothing more than have a good dps build or get a magic weapon. You shouldn‚Äôt have to exploit or optimize just to enjoy new content.
---
It's in one of the TNT domes.
---
Here's to hoping but I'm not getting my hopes up too high. I bet we'll have several within an hour after update :/
---
I agree but know that will not happen. People love to complain over and over about the same thing instead of using thee search feature and adding comments to a thread that already exists. Like someone it must make them feel better. Who knows. But just be ready as it is coming.
---
Bethesda fanboys
---
There's a new meta! AAE and TSE are the best weps starting on Tuesday, did you get any of those? 25%ffr is still good too, and I suspect that 50% vats crits will be more valuable than some realize...
---
LOL, I'm with you that, I don't know, a slight addiction to the game maybe. I'm playing so much less now, I log in and just can't be bothered and log off again.
---
I dropped 2000 scrip over 3 days and didn't get a single drop anyone would want. It'd be different if I at least got some inventory for my vending machine, but Mumbles can keep this zealot's shovel for all her bull shit.
---
Yes if multiple people are shooting at the queen on a public server its harder for the magic effect to trigger. But solo on a private with your one source of damage she is toast.
---
I dont mind people complaining about significant issues.
---
That's a spectacular one! Congrats!
---
Might as well make it a freezer so you can store meat and stuff indefinitely.
---
It‚Äôs already difficult enough to push through Quantum spam and ass/sent armor. Anything that does damage is being nerfed into the ground, especially Bloodied, but armor hasn‚Äôt. As a result it‚Äôll be even harder if not impossible to deal enough damage to eat through their Quantums and ass/sent.
---
over are the days of easy squeaky buckets kicking at vault 76...
---
Surely Beth eventually realise that the systems they have in place only benefit short term and will eventually kill it long term when everyone inevitably burns out on it. Or maybe they won't because bethesda
---
false, just tried. nothing happened.
---
Other people have covered the mechanics of the change. The practice of it is in a lot of cases, the impact isn't that significant. You'll see a lot of big number be less big but in terms of gameplay difference:
---
1. You'll need a few extra bullets for day to day combat but in terms of speed and ease, it doesn't change that much.
---
2. Meta generally remains the same. So what's good now (builds, weapons, legendary effects) will mostly still be good after the change\*
---
\*The exceptions so far to this seem to be melee got hit harder than other weapons so a relatively weaker and explosive effects seem to be more impactful now such that AAE and TSE can outperform junkies (usually 2nd behind bloodied). Only with the explosive effect though. Without it, AA is mostly the same and TS is not that good.
---
Huh, sounds like being able to sell the plans mightz be an oversight...
---
Let's hope it's not tho :P
---
Why would they not release a simple metal porch/balcony handrail set that snaps to floor pieces like an interior wall does and has a split piece for the top of staircases... the world may never know.
---
12 pm est today.
---
I was fighting some super mutants once and from behind them he came through the hail of bullets like Speirs in Band of Brothers to tell me that I wasn‚Äôt shit, then calmly left.
---
My down-vote is ready
---
False. It does work.
---
Insult Bot's Ghost: The amount of bullets you fired at me must correspond to the amount of rejections you received during your miserable life.
---
For the most part. I'm sure someone could min-max this build further for what it does but I think you'd be 80% of the way there just with those few changes.
---
sure, that's why the post is deleted... go screw around somewhere elese.
---
Thank you
---
Commando is already easy mode in live, and it's only going to become *more* ridiculous in the re-balance relative to other builds.  I have no sympathy for them.
---
But to dismiss concerns on the basis of Commandos is foolish.  The "Bethesda can do no wrong" crowd will be chanting this on Tuesday, and it really is a disservice to everyone.
---
The real losers in this whole thing are the players who do high, single-shot damage with slower guns, such as the Lever Action Rifle, Revolvers, etc.   It's hard to stay on top of the endless mobs in Daily Ops when your DPS is so low.  You can get by, sure, but you will have a significantly harder time than any Commando.  Who, as you say, just needs to hold the fire button down for a half-second longer.
---
Unarmed is also in a weird spot because the weapons for that have very strange default base damage values, and because that's the basis for all their math, their output really isn't where it should be.
---
No limits is what we need, let us play as much as we want when we want to!! But of course that is impossible, I would settle for a weekly everything..seriously 
---
I would sure play a whole lot more if I knew i had room for more stuff, my stash is filled rn w trash i got from purveyor, why not let us scrip as much as we want like what the hell üòÖ
---
So sad that we are not heard in this regard no matter how much we try or how many upvotes we get :(
---
I'm a big Vault Boy... :"(
---
You're right, I get too agitated when reading thoughtless nonsense and that's my fault. I am sorry.
---
Dude it does work lol
---
I think in life you need to really stand up for yourself, otherwise people (or apparently companies too) will take advantage of you.
---
It's very unlikely you'll need to take it that far - they just need to believe you might do, to push them into action.
---
Write firmly and professionally, don't be angry but don't apologise. Please don't let them get away with this.
---
Exactly! Why complain about old bugs when there will be new bugs to complain about!
---
this IS indeed decent equipment. not everyone has godtier weapons like you are explained, or is aware of magic weapons (or want to use it). 
---
what's your comment purpose? flex with decent gear?
---
Not that I'm aware of. It's still going to be a good build with the right perk cards. But not as op as it used to be.
---
Posting here definitely doesn‚Äôt accomplish nothing, if people cry about shit real loud on reddit it gets attention from devs , my clan jokes about it regularly like ‚Äú don‚Äôt worry reddit will cry and it will get fixed ‚Äú just look at the nuke issue last week that shit was fixed almost immediately because Redditors lost their collective minds
---
This would be fun, but honestly, I‚Äôm not a fan of farming flux. I‚Äôd rather just do Earle or a queen to earn my flux.
---
Best trick is to launch nuke 1 at earle then 2/3 at farming zones so you get the boss fight then farm flux after
---
I once had it waddle up to me when I was literally stuck behind a tire structure in the bog town and my friends were cracking up because I was so upset that I couldn‚Äôt get away from my own roasting.
---
It's not just reports. More times logging in means more opportunities to tempt you into spending money on the game. It also helps to spread out server load because people are likely logging in a little each day instead of one big hit during peak periods like the weekend.
---
Ah, yes. I can finally become the true vault 94 dweller (because I definitely didn‚Äôt just buy the armors off of Regs).
---
What if the rest of that zone were a rad storm (Instead of whole map) with a chance of nuke spawns? Less then nuke zone, but still better than nothing
---
Sorry for these newb questions but do you only get these at the end of the story?
---
Thx, editing.
---
I think they should add an ‚Äúemotional damage‚Äù effect to our characters which causes the player character to pause and make sobbing noises every few minutes for an hour.
---
*Your monthly challange of meeting toxic people of Fallout 76 has been completed. ( 1/ 1 )*
---
If you‚Äôve got a strong build and very good gear, you can do it.
---
As an example, I played a heavy gunner with a Strangler Heart suit and a combo of a j/e 50cal and a not so great j/crit gauss mini.  Depending on the special abilities the enemies get, I could solo Elder easily with a couple minutes to spare.
---
The only ones I had trouble with were the Ops where I had to melee enemies to finish them.  It just takes time to run to them for kill shots.  I guess you don‚Äôt really need to kill enemies if you don‚Äôt want to waste time, just stand near the uplinks and ignore them if you can tank damage.
---
If you group up with literally anyone able to pull any weight, it‚Äôs pretty easy.  The charge speed on the uplinks improves if your teammates can control themselves and stay nearby.  If you‚Äôre ultra casual with a half-assed build and low tier gear, you‚Äôll be just fine with a team.  
---
A pistol build, rifleman or bow build is not going to be able to solo, possibly at all because those weapon styles have gotten so weak, but anything even resembling a meta build will be competent.
---
The Ops are pretty casual and reasonably generous on time.  This is not a v94 situation where you‚Äôre dead weight if you don‚Äôt know the vault layout blindfolded and can‚Äôt annihilate everything that moves instantly.
---
Thanks man, appreciate the feedback .
---
Bootlicker
---
I have copious amounts of energy ammo in my vendor for my fellow battery bois, and then my character has like 1.5k 2mm EC and 1.2k 5.56 in case I ever run out of 2mm and have to pick up the handmade again, or if Gauss gets a big nerf.
---
Yes, but we've already "cried about shit real loud" and gotten their attention. Therefore, we don't need to do that anymore about SCORE. They know it is an issue.
---
Can‚Äôt it be avoided by not being logged in around reset time? Reset is at 1am for my time zone so I‚Äôm never online for it, and I‚Äôve never lost score. Posts complaining about lost score all got written within the first hour after reset as far as I could see...
---
Fair point.
---
If someone makes one post and they are aware of it then the issue is getting worked on.
---
People making multiple posts on reddit does not make them complete the work any faster.
---
I don't understand this opinion.  In your mind, is the guy who is supposed to fix the nuke issue working very slowly and messing around on his phone but then sees the reddit posts and all of sudden gets his ass into gear?   It doesn't work like this.
---
I kill prize bot on sight but insult bot always puts a smile on my face, wish I could have one at my camp for visitors lol.
---
If anyone is reading this comment I have a lot of masks on PS4 please take them my l stash and console will thank u
---
Yea idk why fuel/2mm isn't listed, absolutely makes no sense.
---
DEAR EVERYONE NOT SURE IF UNIVERSAL BUT I WAS ABLE TO FIX THE ISSUE...i have had this issue for a while but my exact steps to make it work go: i set quest as inactive, server hopped, reset game completely, loaded in, fast traveled to AVR building from my camp, snuck through building killing all enemies from the entrance to the objective (stealthy kills so they never aggro‚Äôd), REPLACED THE FUSE FIRST, clicked it twice, waiting for it to no longer say put in fuse box, then finally went to computer and it was able to analyze...hope this helps everyone trying to progress the questline.
---
It's not a guarantee. It might work, it might not.
---
Assault rifles are actually neck and neck with combat rifles for sustained dps thanks to much faster reloads.
---
I don't think that means what you think it means.
---
^This üëç
---
As a minigun shredder build I back this so much! 
---
Honestly, I just wish there was daily/weekly challenges that awarded say 10 improved repair kits maximum a day. 
---
It could even be introduced in a system like the gold bullion, aka you get tickets when you complete an event and say 5 tickets gives you a repair kit, 10 gives you an improved repair kit etc
---
Sadly it does , ammo machine dupers would be gone by now but reddit excuses it so the devs don‚Äôt do shit , these people live on social media
---
Id consider it if the prices at least were decent and based on the stars rather than the base weapon. Bc a 2 star ripper is worth more in scrip than it is in caps, but if I could get 250-500 caps Id be much more willing to sell.
---
Hmmm I doubt that if I‚Äôm honest but ok. Even so. The argument for increasing damage to any of them is false as they‚Äôre an improvement on the same weapon
---
what is the legendary effect of the shotgun?
---
So you believe they judge exploits on a case-by-case basis by using posts on reddit as a barometer of what is and isn't acceptable?
---
I find this hard to believe.
---
Finally moved those perk points out on my heavy. My new favorite perk hands down.
---
Pretty sure the entire 1st page being full of posts on how shitty the ammo converter was got their attention. Of course, they didn't actually make it better.
---
I‚Äôm waaaaay over encumbered, have like 20 weapons on me, not one of them worth keeping. I was hoping for a Fixer this time around, I have the plans but after 5000k+ I have yet to roll one, oh well.
---
Does no damage
---
Gives -1 Perception per hit :)
---
"You shot -enemy-'s eye out"
---
They're not useless until you get to a higher level. I'd quite like a system like STW where some types of weapon just don't exist in the legendary pool.
---
Understandable, still exactly what happens going off their track record
---
I‚Äôm the same way. There is a reason I have a 6TB hd. So many games I haven‚Äôt even played haha.
---
I started playing in June, I‚Äôve hit endgame with my stealth sniper (now stealth commando) but I‚Äôve been itching to make a PA heavy gunner... resisted the urge to play a second character because I wanna try it with One Wasteland. Hopefully it adds more flexibility on where you can go next, there were lots of random annoying difficulty spikes with my first character (eg Colonel Gutsys during the excavator PA quest).
---
Ambivalence. I'm not looking forward to the combination of overall damage reduction and everything suddenly being level 75+(I just deleted my perkless wonder food build character for this reason), but the rest sounds positive.
---
Yes! forest horde events should be much better.
---
Wait there really is a bunker under the green brier?
---
There is no active season right now. Check back tomorrow.
---
New season starts tomorrow
---
You're grounded until tomorrow.
---
Sorry, it's an Assassin. I'm trying to roll a Bloodied. Would that have an effect on why it won't take anything down? I figured 830 DMG it would be good lol.
---
For the game board, I actually put a painting down first, and then the game board on top of that, a little fiddly but it worked. (Got the idea off this sub somewhere)
---
Yeah. The squeaky wheel gets the grease and eventually replaced.
---
Thanks guys. Appreciate it!
---
fissure site prime is probably the best place to farm it now because if a scorchbeast spawns in in the nuke zone it normally brings a shitload of scorched with it, that's how I've been getting materials for 2-4 fluxes per run there recently. You get fuck all spawn over at Monongah in my experience
---
I've been wondering why unarmed is so popular. I know there are builds that yield thousands of damage per swing but shouldn't the same be possible with slugger? Unarmed gets the brawlers arm mods but slugger gets two more damage perk sets.
---
If it‚Äôs still an issue it absolutely should at a minimum have a ticket submitted.
---

That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights, though it will work just fine for aa as well
---
someone misses the movies of the 1980's with there 10 minute shower scene that had nothing to do with the movie, and maybe that girl in the shower wasn't even in the movie after or before the part where she was in the shower lol. 
---
oh and lead and copper bullets make steel gas tanks explode even though lead and copper dont spark . and tires squealed on dirt roads .
---
LOL, I love it!
---
Because you don't keep yourself up to date on what's going on with the game. That's why you don't have daily and weekly challenges.
---
make sure you're close , use vats with shotgun fully charged and target head
---
Yes, that's true. There are many options we have available to us to let Bethesda know. Posting here is not one of them.
---
Can he not get it from scrapping gauss rifles? Now I'm wondering how I even got it. Good to know if I ever make a new character.
---
Thank you for the advice I‚Äôll take this into consideration when distributing my levels!
---
1) Range. Like all shotguns, the Gauss shotgun is range-limited. Unless you're relatively up close and personal, it does very low damage.
---
2) Explosive damage. A large part of the damage on Gauss family guns is explosive, which has hitbox issues with the SBQ.
---
3) It's a shotgun. It mostly only works well in VATS whereas outside VATS all shotguns have... issues.
---
Except for all the other bugs that need to be fixed.
---
Not all of us are.
---
Maybe that's what's behind the uptick in griefer a-holes lately. I was farming Charleston Landfill yesterday and some basement dweller who's never known the touch of a woman killed me and ran off. Didn't even claim the workshop.
---
I left a note in case he came back.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/XxJFMVr.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XxJFMVr.jpg)
---
Later on, a high-level person claimed that workshop when I wasn't there, but that kind of thing isn't griefing, obviously, and I have no issue with it. I hope he got a chuckle out of my sign, assuming he saw it. When he logged off and I reclaimed it, it was still there; I was halfway expecting a response, but he probably knew it wasn't aimed at him.
---
I keep my mic off and other players permanently muted because I have no desire to listen to the dulcet tones of labored breathing and Cheetos wrappers from these dopes. I may be missing out on something by doing so since the vast majority of players still seem like normal, functioning members of society, but oh well.
---
Walk it off.... CHUMP!
---
Excellent informative response, as usual.  üòÅüëçüëçüëç
---
No we can't, because that's exactly what it is.
---
And you know what? Screw bloodied and junkie.
---
Dps. Slugger is too sluggish. Plus there is a mutation specific to unarmed.
---
Crab boat. Hee! I‚Äôm just imagining what the next level of this is? I work on a container ship&gt;I‚Äôm an astronaut on International Space Station, yearly limits are needed!
---
Mostly continuing the discussion. But yeah, also some flexing :-P
---
I'm on PC, but thanks for the kind offer.  Even now I join public teams, scramble to finish the challenge as quickly as possible, then leave the team and switch servers.  Yes, it makes me that anxious to group with strangers.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve been playing other games and kinda hopping on for like 10 minutes. I used to be really invested into fo76, I still am but not in the same way. Guess it‚Äôs time to jump back in!
---
Not sure if you meant me in particular but I'm not really complaining.  I do think fixing the magic weapon thing should have been the larger priority over across the board nerfs, but stuff like melee stacking to 20,000+ damage a hit was super overpowered as well.  Only difference is that stacking buffs took at least some actual effort, planning and time whereas any dingaling can pick up a magic weapon and ruin events for everyone else trying to play legitimately.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they end up seeing even more widespread use by people that are mad their regular damage got nerfed which would be unfortunate.  If that's the case instead of 7 seconds it will be 4 now.
---
How?? I have all unyielding armor pieces, 11 agility, lvl 3 sneak perk card and bird bones and I'm always in [danger] what's wrong with my build? Is because the armor is heavy combat armor? I remember in fallout 4 that heavy armor isn't good for sneak, is the same in fallout 76? :'( help please
---
That's pretty much the opposite way of how you should be thinking if you want to protect yourself. Your credit card number is a very low risk piece of information to give out, but using a credit card offers you a very high degree of consumer protection. The credit card issuer can shut off a number and issue you a new card almost instantly with no fee if you suspect it's lost or stolen. They all offer buyer protection too, which would protect you from things like this as a last resort when the company you bought from won't resolve the situation. Not just that but prepaid cards themselves are a scam. The fees are insane compared to a credit card. If you're using the prepaid debit cards because you don't qualify for a normal credit card there are prepaid credit cards that anyone can get which are way better than the prepaid debit cards as far as fees and consumer protections go.
---
Some Players: \*Complaining about ammo sponges\*  
---
Me: \*Laughs in Two-Shot\*
---
Dmg you see in the gun profile and dmg inflicted aren‚Äôt the same thing. The armor protection of the enemy can greatly reduce the dmg you are putting out. SBs, Squatch, and mirelurk queens are heavily armored. Use clips and perks that add to armor dmg. Then there‚Äôs the broken vats that sometimes doesn‚Äôt actually register even when you see dmg numbers, especially with gauss weapons and often when targeting enemies that are moving (in the air) while you‚Äôre shooting. Using your hipshot/iron sights vs vats on a flying SB can make for very different results.
---
I am super tight with scrap. This sale has killed my game play. Pain in the butt. All i got out of all the script for high level was 2 guns. Low level scored huge. Which is only level 5. Drives me nuts I 'earned' script only to have to sell for caps super low weapons which are too heavy. Cause you know I need 5 broadsiders weighing me down
---
That's true, and I don't see any nuke's other than those two locations. Imagine if after each of those events, that players might then follow a Radstorm North, Southwest, or wherever it might go. That's what I am suggesting.
---
No need to max it. Just the Level 1 Perk which costs no coins gives you the three ranks of both lockpick and hack and auto unlocking of level 0. Picking and hacking is easy enough. Save those perk points for something that matters more. :)
---
Grafton. Go meet the mayor.
---
True. it took me quite a long time to stop grabbing everything, and i still have to snap out of it say "I dont need that, why did i pick that up". its damn satisfying loot everything mindlessly lol and having a huge and free stash.
---
It does suck, playing for more than 30m is counter productive if you don't start dropping things on the ground
---
Were you one of the ones that had the atom glitch where you were getting tons of atoms for no reason? I wonder if they're dragging their feet doing refunds while they try to figure out the bug that caused that? No idea, I'm just thinking out loud.
---
1x Bloodied fixer and 2x quad fixers. Everything else back to scrip machine.
---
You can't get prime plans from scrapping _any_ gun
---
I'd buy stealthboy backpack and jetpack for SS armor

---
The monorail in Morgantown is real, and you can see the Mountaineer statue that sits where Vault Boy is.
---
The Flatwoods museum is tiny but worth a stop (pandemic permitting).
---
And absolutely the Mothman museum (pandemic permitting).
---
It‚Äôs beautiful, enjoy!
---
I had fun over on the pts so looking forward to it. Daily ops was great
---
For Xbox, as long as you log in with the same account, your characters, with all their gear will be there.   I usually play on my console.   But sometimes I play on my husband's console.   I get a 60 second "syncing game data" message, and then my game is there, just as I left it.
---
Your in game photos are tied to the console.  So screenshot anything you want to save so it will be in your Xbox live account.
---
Consider it this way, do you group when you do ACP or SBQ? Everyone shows up with the same goal either way, and it gets done faster. Not to mention someone around to stimpack you if needed. There's no downside to not grouping in Daily Ops.
---
Also filling in the gaps to max out your 150 scrip is real.
---
I am super excited! The only maintains I‚Äôve seen are Western NC and small part of southeast Tennessee. I‚Äôm told WV is nothing BUT mountains and I can‚Äôt wait!
---
agreed, this seems like a no-brainer considering how we've consistently been told having all these items bogs their servers down, dont make us carry around weeks worth of scrip, just let us get rid of it now.
---
You can keep your preferred weapon style for any op, assuming you‚Äôre not playing an archer,  black powder or some other intentionally gimpy flavor build.  
---
At the very worst, build a suit of power armor for your commando and maybe put a backup knife on your hot wheel to hit enemies if gun bashing is too hard.
---
Trust me, it‚Äôs totally understandable. No need to explain yourself, you‚Äôre doing the best that you can.
---
It‚Äôs a bitch and I don‚Äôt mind not reading the post about it. Just like I didn‚Äôt read your post about bitching about people bitching.
---
I call them wendigos
---
Umm... You might want to hold off for a few days. You might be surprised to see what the outcome is.
---
wut
---
üëçüëçüëç  yes, I would so pay atoms for that.
---
I love the shredder, but it breaks so frigging fast even with level 3 "lucky break". I was using gunsmith though... Not sure if makeshift warrior applies to shredder damage instead ??
---
As a level 362 I‚Äôm sitting on dozens of unused cards.  Not to mention about 40 slots.  Bring it on
---
This third cannibal perk does not spark joy.
---
How did you get the progress on the beacons to go fast enough to solo elder?
---
I was sprinting to each beacon and sitting on it so it would progress as fast as possible but I could never seem to get them to go fast enough.
---
I never even died so I was there on the beacons the whole time. It just felt like they made it impossible to get elder alone.
---
I only tried this on the one with super mutants in the burning mine though. The others I was too busy fighting enemies and being dead to make a serious effort for a fast time.
---
In the Forest?
---
Never did figure out how to open those.
---
Insult bot and the traveling merchant super mutant are my favorite parts of the game.
---
Yes, I only did it alone on pts.
---
The mob mutation where they can only die with a melee hit is the hardest alone. The rest weren't bad
---
Are you on guys on PS4?
---
That sign is hilarious! But to kill you and not even claim the workshop? For real why even waste time then I guess this basement dweller was trying to be an actual raider And prove a point to himself. He give zero shits about the loot or potential loot he just want blood on his hands just because he can.
---
Seriously? Yes there is. They based Whitespring on a real bunker, they've obviously taken many artistic liberties with the concept, but it's a real place you can go and tour when the Covid lockdowns are over.
---
After mutation penalties and not wearing an uny suit, I have a 1 str on my commando.  A backup shishkebab I use to heal friendlies works just fine.  You can shoot enemies down to 1 pixel of health and just poke them with a stick for the kill shot.  It‚Äôs a stupid effect.
---
Because it ended up being a lv20 trash even lv9000+ characters. xD
---
No, you can't.   A mic or Xbox direct message should help!
---
If it's still a corpse you can just move it with explosives.
---
We need zero limits on scripping and some sort of limit on purchases because I can't manage my own inventory. Hundreds of guns and multiple characters!! I can't just drop this stuff but like...what do I do with it??? I am ruining my own experience ü§™ plz send help
---
We're literally in the off season. Not much else to keep people occupied.
---
Yes!! üòàüòàüòà
---
That is the one thing I‚Äôve already noticed, I tried using it against earl and it was breaking every 20 seconds of holding it down even with gunsmith on
---
Yeah man I really really wish it was 160. Such a pain dealing with that 30 scrip ta the end
---
DoT like burning, bleed damage and Strangler Heart acid do not proc vampire effects.
---
Multiple pellets and explosive legendary effects each count for a vampiric hit, on any target they touch.  Your gun will break super fast, but shooting a v/e shotgun into a mass of ghouls will bring you from 10% health to full almost immediately.
---
If you‚Äôre holding a vampiric weapon and use the Ricochet perk, you will heal a small amount when the perk procs.  Similarly, other damage boosting legendary effects will apply to reflected projectiles, but it‚Äôs usually such a small amount as to be insignificant.  It‚Äôs only obvious when you have a bloody gun, a lvl 3 Scorched shoots you, and kills himself immediately.
---
Are they back in the game?
---
Stabilized Arms only applies to **Scoped** weapons, iirc. The point of Stabilized Arms is to make each single shot more accurate by eliminating weapon sway entirely. 
---
So, if you put a Short Scope on your Fixer, you would not need to hold your breath while ADS. However, it does nothing for reflex sights, nor does it do anything for automatic weapon fire. It will always kick like a wild horse; that's just the kind of weapon the Fixer is, and why the vast majority of people use it in VATS.
---
the half-ass legendary run broke me.  its been weeks since i logged in and im having to convince myself to try the update on tues (esp since it means deleting from the ps4 &amp; reinstalling, an 8-hr process)
---
Yep, even if the door is closed, you only need to jump a couple floors up in the right wing and turn on the switch. If you have Marsupial mutation or a jetpack, it's less than a minute to open that door and get to the benches.
---
When does it end?
---
what about glow sight? Its an awesome perk.  Makes Earls wendingos melt with my .50 cal
---
A two star ripper is a legacy and worth a lot more than either
---
"Maybe to not be so proud." Dude. You don't understand how much I worked hard on this game. It is very hard to also find friends to even give me such a weapon in the first place. So please, do me a favor, stop commenting stuff like that.
---
I don't normally care but it was particularly annoying during the sale.
---
&gt;Plan: Whistle in the Dark
---
Guess I can scrip mine survival legacy now huh?
---
Combat rifles take longer to reload than to empty a clip, and faster reloads are a multiplicative buff so they will do relatively well after the nerf. If you have speed demon it will be a 5.5% difference, or only 2% without it.
---
More of a shocker is that a quad fixer will outperform a bloodied fixer on an otherwise bloodied build even with speed demon. Here's the original [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4dDlj-2q24GIUeAeQKp2lNhvjy-T4vlEcHux3Y6YEk/edit?usp=sharing).
---
there is no level cap in FO76. i have been playing for over a year and i‚Äôm under 100. last week, i saw a level 1080.
---
IF they done that, they would give less than 7 times of the daily limits for a week Im sure lol. Any artificial limit is actually slowly pushing players away.
---
I just wish the caps were more reasonable. It should be 2500 daily vendor cap limit, 50K hard cap limit, Legendary return 150 limit  is the most absurd one, we already have 1000 scrip limit, why do we need another arbitrary random small limit, that i dont understand. some days I keep getting bunch of heavy 1\* weapons, some days I land on 4 lightweight 3\* legendaries and we cant even return 4 LOL 4x3\*=160. At least have some average round number like 250 or 300. ITs already grindy for legendary weapon hunt, let alone a decent one.
---
It also slows down your general progress in the game. I love sitting down and playing huge chunks of a game, all day. with Fallout 76, especially after doing the all quests, there isnt much to do but set my own goal, like doing some silly atom challenges.
---
Legendary perks come tomorrow?
---
What is this commie comment?! Its 'dookie' because it isn't made in the GOD DAMN USA!
---
LOL I'm waiting for the "Reload Your Gun and Explode" bug or something equally ridiculous and game breaking....at least its game breaking after you stop laughing! (In all honesty I'm eager for the update but we all know there can be...issues)
---
Nice thank you
---
Why no need to upgrade "what rads?"
---
I‚Äôve been playing this game since November of 2018
---
The bitching and moaning about PvP at workshops is nothing new
---
Find Melody Larkin....ask her to tone it down a tad?
---
yes.  unless they delay but they are scheduled for tomorrow
---
stalker, assassin , nocturnal, zealot,  hunter. there all crap
---
Fair, but I don‚Äôt have too many issues with them without it so it seemed like a good time to move them.
---
I don't run any ranks of gunsmith in the live game or the PTS. 
---
As long as you're not getting hit the degradation is not bad at all.
---
The only enemies that were still doing a decent amount of wear on my stuff were the robots with the cryo attack. If they were on the menu I knew I needed at least a few repair kits or a workbench.
---
Man really wish we new if electrical absorptions healing is a bug or not. That's make or break info for me, and a lot of others in sure
---
Huh. Thanks I thought it was next Tuesday. Thanks for the great news!!
---
Yep, he got me when I was in the midst of collecting scrap from the junk extractors, and he left the full loot bag, too.
---
He wasn't even that high a level. I'm sure I could've smoked him with my TSE legacy, but I couldn't possibly give less of a crap about getting back at them. Their lives are obviously a pathetic shambles and that's punishment enough.
---
Oh no I meant like, Xbox gift cards, the 10/25/50 dollar ones. I mainly do that cause I carry cash and don't feel like depositing it into my back account. But yes I see where you are coming from
---
I believe the theory is that the difference between 50 rad resistance vs 300 is negligible in most cases hence not being worth the coins required to upgrade. As with anything, individual mileage will vary. :)
---
Good point.  I will try it myself and see if its work keeping.  I have had it from level 100 to 200.
---
interesting. but i think they could also fight that with more XP or limit bonuses during the week. And I believe once you get the game you ahve right to play it 24/7 lol
---
Yeah that's cool but every time I switch to the normal pipboy view I find myself going back to the quickboy. It's just soooo much faster and causes so many fewer game crashes.
---
Can almost guarantee it's a bug, not mentioned and very OP, things like that are always unintended, like the Unyielding masks :-)
---
No I wasn't, and if that's the case then I can understand why they would be a little slow. But not two months
---
I'm wondering how fights with SBQ and Earl will go now that some of the highest damage builds will do noticably less damage. Especially when few people attend (it happens sometimes).
---
Ok thanks
---
Some explosive energy weapons are totally glitched.  Almost as bad as the Quad FFR Tesla.  I had a lvl 55 just melt me (from a long distance away) with an explosive Gat Plasma.  I can eat a lot of damage but was no match.
---
Same... I'd consider a PA build if it's intended. I'm fairly certain it's not.
---
Even if they kept it at 150, let me scrip 4 3star weapons, I'll eat the 10 scrip I don't receive, otherwise I may end up leaving 30 scrip on the table (in the machine). It's not like they do that when you hit MAX scrip.
---
That's exactly it. Most people don't farm flux, so this would be an alternate.
---
Yeah, I think it should have double the power since it seems to have at least double the area.
---
Yeah just a huge bummer since all the pa cards stink haha. I only really want 3 cards. The rest are meh
---
Hey those 10 minute shower scenes involving random girls are an integral part of the movie...
---
They help provide an interlude between on action filled explosion scene and another action filled explosions scene :)
---
Glow sight perk does nothing.  They are not glowing enemies.
---
I'm on
---
Yeah that would also be good
---
As long as one of the cards you use to upgrade the perk is animated, the resulting upgraded card will be animated.
---
You have to claim them, pick a card and then scrap that card to get the coins.
---
Depends on how it would be done for ammunition.  Cheap, bulky ammunition would need to have a high minimum before you're able to bulk scrap it to get materials back, that would alleviate the potential problem of getting a little *too much* back, but more valuable ones wouldn't need that much.
---
Part of the problem is that Bethesda opted for a little too much of streamlined approach to ammunition crafting.  If they had the same system that New Vegas had with its reloading bench, it wouldn't have the same potential problem, as then scraping common, bulk-type ammunition like .50 rounds would only provide you ample supply of lead, but you'd still need the right primer and casings for non-rifle ammunition.  You'd really only have an excess of lead in this situation, whereas if you were to be able to hypothetically dismantle ammunition in 76, you'd have an excess of gunpowder, lead, and steel, which would then allow you craft pretty much everything except shotgun shells.
---
That dude was probably Formula P stacking - that thing is *not* even slightly accurate at range unless you‚Äôre Formula P stacking which is technically an exploit because it shouldn‚Äôt be possible.
---
they look likenthey are glowing but you are right.  Gheir name doesnt have glowing in them.  i feel dumb
---
Ahh yes, another one.  
---
Rebalances happen in these types of games.   Your post reminds me of my ESO days when they would make changes and peeps cried because they had to adjust. 
---
Additional thoughts:
---
Changes keep the game interesting.  I for one am going to take each of my 5 characters through the rounds, after some needed changes with perks and probably weapons, based upon research of reports by reputable peeps that have spent time on PTS.  
---
The game was already too easy at endgame. 
---
The changes taken as a whole should allow groups of different levels to play together more effectively.
---
Oh, right, I forgot about the talons. The slower swing speed more or less balances out with the higher base damage of slugger, but 25% extra damage is really significant.
---
Based on the looks of it it makes it more likely if you are on during the reset, but it is still possible even if you aren't on during reset
---
Most stink, I buy ammo, rarely pick locks, don't care if stuff blows up, the SPECIAL boosts are the ones I will go for.
---
Theres's no excuse for the server thing. Currently you can rent servers on a per-hour basis. I'm pretty sure big companies with MMO games are able to call new servers on demand. Even more if you have a past history were you can predict loads quite accurately.
---
Ding!
---
Fissure site prime assert your dominance XD
---
I miss the Chinese assault rifle, by far one of my favorite fallout weapons
---
I'm not home for a while, I'm interested to see what it will be like but I'm dreading the inevitable fuckery
---
Yeah I've got 100k of all ammos I use. Don't give a darn about the junk you get from locks. I want sizzling and funky at r1, and I'll max taking one for the team.
---
Think I'll take luck I guess, don't know about the other 2 lol
---
Lol.  Love it.  And this is coming from someone with 4 junkies alts.   I'm looking forward to the changes.
---
Most of my test runs were also in burning mines with super mutants and i was consistently getting \~7min runs. I was using unyielding set so i didn't run out of AP and could keep the speed up while running from objective to objective. Could it be that i had better pathing in the mine?
---
From start of the ops i just ran straight to the 1st objective without stopping for any of the enemies. Finished the first objective still not killing enemies.
---
Then straight to 2nd objective, again not stopping for anything. Standing 100% of the time within the timed area and killed all the enemies that followed me. EDIT: Small tip, i hid behind objects within the timed area to make ranged mobs close in on me, so i don't have to leave the area myself to finish them off.
---
Straight to 3rd objective without stopping, rinse/repeat.
---
And then boss.
---
Mainly, move as fast as you can from objective to objective. Enemies, while you need to kill them to survive were still secondary and only killed within the timed circle area thingy (signal something something). After first 2-3 learning runs when my pathing was fine tuned i didn't die once.
---
You can open them with Patch 22. I tested this a lot on the PTS. No problems or hiccups. Got tons of duplicates of stuff that I couldn't get previously.
---
I wonder how cool would be a Dev's brainstorming session for listing those insults for uploading üòÇ
---
omg they did that? I was wondering how others were able to kill the mob so fast or something lol every nuke zone run would yield me 5-10 stable flux. I was pimping all of  my power armors, now i ditched some of them cuz i cannot even get 5.
---
Where did you get the Deathclaw ..I get anything but that on the lake ne corner map.
---
You mean at most. 
---
If your going to force a limit, at the most, make it weekly, not daily. Otherwise, no limit at all. 
---
The most that we should be limited to is weeklies. 
---
If it were "weekly limits at least", think of all the other limits they could implement.
---
Most excited for the chance to get a sympto-matic for my camp and finally scrapping all those perk cards I don‚Äôt use but have to scroll through lol
---
I am a vampire patriarch who sleeps years at a time to share power with other patriarchs to prevent our undead war from destroying the living world.  It would be great if I could get a decade limit on scrip OR I WILL DRINK THE WORLD DRY TO DESTROY MY USURPERS!
---
Yeah test it in a private world, see how few enemies even spawn!
---
PTS Spoilers based upon Datamine: &gt;!Electric Absorption restoring health in addition to restoring fusion core charge is definitely intended based upon how it is coded into the perk. Also, the cost to upgrade Legendary Perks was reduced to 50, 100, and 150 respectively.!&lt;'
---
My bad that was an example, I guess my memory was stuck on some ripper I got back when I first started playing, but in any case the idea was a a legendary item with a low sell cost..
---
I've seen the same thing.
---
All the posts about it are always within the window of an hour or so around the reset time. In my time zone, reset is at 11am, and since I work days I never get on till evening and I never once lost score to the autocomplete bug.
---
It seems too big a coincidence to not be a factor.
---
Nuke zones are as glitchy and unstable as they are, I doubt they can make it move :D
---
Lol yeah I used to vender legendaries all day way back when
---
Good idea +1
---
But can the game engine handle your idea?
---
Scrip. [It's an old term.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip)
---
is it still better to fully upgrade perk cards before turning them into coins? or can you just scrap three level 1 cards and they'll net you the same amount as an actual level 3 one?
---
I try not to disagree with the data miners, and while it may be intended for now, I imagine once they see how exploitable this is with how fast it recharges FC's and makes you basically invincible... I see it getting nerfed real quick.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs doing just over half the damage of a bloodied per shot so for ammo alone the bloodied is the go to. The dps is worked out over the fire  time on that chart so it‚Äôs very deceptive
---
Finally looks like min 80% are uselessüòÇ
---
Hold yer positivity, it may be a monkey paw scenario: yes we will be able to cripple her, but then she turns into an Ash pile.....
---
Wait until tomorrows patch or longer for well research information, you might not see the point in spending 9 points on commando for 33ish more points of damage.
---
Classical is all we get, the recent one is just a skin basically :-)
---
My birthday was back in may during the first big corona lockdown. Couldn't see any of my friends or family that day so was a bit bummed out. 
---
Someone I'd recently befriended in the game found this out, so they and a bunch of their friends all turned up at my camp and dropped great presents and sang happy birthday to me. 
---
It could have been because i was a few beers deep at the time but i was pathetically grateful for it.
---
Support? Non-existent. 
---
But it works, kinda. IF you manually change the settings in the ini.
---
Has anyone looked into the actual numbers of how Hack and Slash scales with weapon damage? If it's anywhere near 100% that's going to be a good perk.
---
The slots are there and usable if you've unlocked them on the account (by having ANY character over level 50). Earning perk coins before level 50 however would be very difficult, so you're going to only have base level cards.
---
I agree, but in a game with such a horrible rng, its very hard to adjust. At first we collected tse guns, then they nerfed them and we traded them away to get bloodied guns, now bloodied guns get nerfed so hard that tse guns are the strongest again (when used on a bloodied build). Thats annoying. I can live it, i wanted to post this a month ago but then i decided to get tse guns again before i talk about it and i got them. I was able to adjust. Turns out could have posted this before trying to trade for tse again because people here have no idea how this game is played and dont want to hear the truth. :)
---
Updated the Coin cost. Thank you!
---
This sub reflects the state of the game; therefore, if a problem is as chronic as the missing score one, then we absolutely should be hearing about it over and over until it is fixed.
---
It‚Äôs not a case of letting Bethesda know, it‚Äôs letting them know that people are still pissed about it.
---
Damn, that jukebox rock music at the lumber place is fantastic background music.
---
Don't feel stupid at all.  They look like glowies
---
There's no difference in the latest PTS.
---
Yeah. I hope it sticks. But with it not being mentioned in the card has me scared for it
---
some idiot tried the dupe method that was patched, you lucked out :-)
---
Ready your mind.... some of the toys are going to be broken, if history is any indication.  Some of the broken ones will get replaced with mostly working toys 
---
Also Reddit is going to lose their shit, and the hate train comes back for a few weeks.  
---
I'm pumped for the changes though.  Needed.  üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Damn, was hoping that wasn‚Äôt the case but thanks. (And yes, I do use VATS all the time just was looking for something with Earle while I waited for my AP to regen.)
---
You can just scrap lvl 1 cards. You get 2 coins per rank of card
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee
---
A Burf?
---
Dont forget about 33% VATS accuracy. Shoot from further and get that magic damage
---
I bang one of the 24/7 fallout stations on from You Tube, does the job :-)
---
If you manage to get it working in ultra-wide, make sure you play in Full Screen. For some reason, this game thinks you're using a freaking toaster if you use borderless. I'm talking 120% performance increase in most cases. 
---
(Also don't Alt-Tab in loading screens; it'll lock your mouse cursor to a weird 60% of the screen and you'll have to restart the game)
---
Stabilized arm mods apply to scope sway.  They don‚Äôt help with iron and reflex sights.
---
If you prefer to not use VATS, go for true barrel and stock mods to make hipfire more accurate.  The on screen crosshairs on a fixer can get very small, especially if you also add in Ground Pounder.
---
The benefit of Ground Pounder is diminished if you use the Speed Demon mutation, and Tank Killer, Glow Sight and Concentrated Fire are very arguably better investments for min/max, but if you don‚Äôt use vats and like automatic rifles, true mods with hip fire could be worth a test.  I use them on a 10mm SMG because that thing has no sights worth using.  Hip fire or VATS only.
---
Step 1 - Nerf
---
Step 2 - steal underpants
---
Step 3 - ?
---
Step 4 - a working game and profit!
---
I found the robots with stealth the hardest. Those bastards could not be targetted in vats before they were in your face blasting mad damage (to a bloodied char). Those melee ones were much easier for me, just shoot them to 1hp and bash them with your weapon.
---
I've never seen any bots :/
---
I believe the testing revealed that is was similar to the Explosive legendary effect. About 20% of base damage.
---
One of the advertising points of 76 was about distant weather systems, and you can see thunderstorms and Radstorms from vantage points, then travel to the and find they are happening, so yes, I think it can üòÄ
---
it sounds nice, yes...but im over here waiting on a better storage system...I lose interest quickly due to the limited storage space, its infuriating to say the least
---
Ha, when I Alt Tab when in load screens it locks the whole PC, even the Task Manager is stuck behind it...
---
How many coins per perk card?
---
When are the perks coming out?
---
Ahhh yes... the exact answer I didn‚Äôt want but also the exact answer that I knew I would get. Thanks for this! I‚Äôll give it a shot
---
Weather systems in the game already move as far as I can tell. They just don't have much point at the moment.
---
Looks like it.. But i would hold on to it anyway :) I got all survival weapons stashed away on my mule. Remnants of the perfect gamemode (imo).
---
Insult bot needs to be a new end game boss
---
My build is gonna have 4 SPECIAL legendary perks. I can leave the rest.
---
Great point.    üëç
---
Welcome to the world of impossible weapons and legendary PA, rings and outfits etc though :-)
---
Huh
---
All Jukeboxes, including the new one, only come in one form - a small subset of the Classical Radio playlist.
---
Ever since we got Appalachia Radio (for that matter, the full Classical Radio) added to the placeable radios, we've wanted that as an option for the Jukeboxes too.  Hasn't happened.
---
Scheduled for the patch tomorrow.
---
Did you read my post? Or were you just in a hurry to try and sound clever?
---
With the ultra high perception of lvl 100 enemies, players are going to notice the absence of shadowed mods on Secret Service.  For stealth, it is way behind Thorn, or even leather if stealth is your main source of defense.
---
I still feel a bit like garbage for taking it anyway, but it will get better :P
---
It's fine with a stealth commando build.  Did back to back elder runs last night with no issues.  And this is just the first mission type.  They will introduce more missions as time goes on that likely won't have piercing gaze.
---
I‚Äôve got one of those.
---
I run unyielding unarmed; mostly I use it without perks, and it can handle most encounters; I have four points in perception, if I‚Äôm going to be doing heavy combat, I switch in tank killer, and the top three commando cards.
---
This, and I've renamed the armour I want to keep with numbers at the front 1XX =NORMAL, 2XX=Extra luck, 4XX=Extra Charisma,  also apply paint/skins to stop you selling them. (I also picked up _any_ crappy legendary version of what I normally used ASAP  - that way I couldn't  scrap it by accident etc.
---
wait why are we going to need those materials on tuesday?
---
But not pissed enough to post at a location that would be more effective. Got it. Great point!
---
Nerf incoming? No I already have the nine points in commando, I switch from semi to full auto depending on what I feel like playing for the day!
---
You can run almost unlimited queens every day and get improved kits that way. That‚Äôs how me and my friends have over 300 improved repair kits each.
---
A lot of people are very upset about it.
---
I'm not happy about it, but I'm going give it a chance and see how bad it actually is before I get too worked up about it.
---
It's listed in the document, but 50, 100, 150. So 300 for a fully ranked perk.
---
Being trying to fathom how this would work and can only imagine a limbless set of clothes crouch-walking around.
---
Wow, that worked perfectly. Thank you!
---
No sorry I meant coins per card swapped over. How many per perk card?
---
I‚Äôll look into these edits. Thanks man!
---
4 characters with maxed scrip going in...then recycled each day to pick up more legendary weapons.
---
I don't play bloodied or junkies.
---
Received 1 bloodied assaultron head. 1 Junkies pipe pistol - not much to trade there.
---
Not a single Two-shot weapon. The only explosive weapons I received were on single action pistols (3 or 4 of them at that).
---
The odds must be staggering to not at least receive SOMETHING that I would use.
---
The excuse is self-evident - this game isn't worth spending money on. Bethesda is doing the absolute bare minimum to produce &amp; support this game. You think that they're going to spend money on providing adequate resources?
---
I know but these encounters are of very angry people or at least seem angry, I can take hint and tell when someone is messing around to burn some time but these are not that, or maybe peoples intentions are to seem actually mad but are not and are trying to get a reaction out of me? I have so many questions and concerns right now. In the end i just find the encounters extremely amusing, one guy threaded ‚Äú I will find you and beat you up just like in this game ‚Äú little does he know i to am to specced in the real world as an automatic rifle build lol.
---
On a side note I hate the unrealistic weight of pre war money
---
Find an old lady in a shop that looks a bit like Mumbles and smash her one square in the face for me :-)
---
ahh... 2 coins per level. I haven't tested the cards that start at level 2 and the PTS is now down.
---
I do hope that we get the Normal Chinese assault rifle skin for the Handmade.
---
The Communist style is cool, but the normal one is a bit better.
---
What do you use for survival? I'm running barbarian, fireproof, dense and serendipity for when my sneak fails, but still dying A LOT when that happens.
---
I would be happy with the canned music from that one jukebox (not Appalachia radio or classical)...I actually thought it was a lot better than either of the radio options.
---
Funny they don't have it as an option when it's only played on a jukebox...but then again I've only heard it on that one jukebox anyway.
---
She'll understand :-)
---
Working out dps over fire time was the point, someone was asking about sustained damage versus Earl in some other threads (that's also what the damage per shot numbers assume). The bloodied weapon has better burst damage but in that sustained situation it's 15% behind a quad, which is a lot, even more than you get by running ffr versus non-ffr. The bloodied is also at least twice as expensive if you're trying to buy one.
---
Right. It on that chart is the dps not worked out per clip?
---
Each perk is 1 slot. No matter the level of the card
---
Heard anything about it ?
---
Nice try Todd.
---
oh thank god
---
Haha enough said!
---
Dump all the shotgun business and stick with that handmade.  You have a $10,000 custom shop Gibson Les Paul in the studio and you‚Äôre worried why your $100 Epiphone is buzzing.
---
You really should experiment with just Rank 1 of each though, after the nerf.
---
I found on PTS that the difference between the full Rank 3 and Rank 1 only ended up being 10 damage... and being 6 SPECIAL points poorer for it.  It could free up space for some other things.
---
The reason this happens is because the 10/15/20% on the card doesn't end up actually being that anymore.  They base all of their math on the *base damage* of your rifle.  That's without any mods - totally standard.  Well, everyone knows that if you stick a Hardened Receiver or other mods on it, it buffs the damage quite a bit.  But that's not reflected in that math - it's just tossed into the additive calculation later.  So, what you're really looking at is another 10% of that *base damage*.  Most Rifles hover around 40-50 base damage.  Hence, that's why it doesn't add up to much.
---
LOL - I guess some people enjoy annoying, pointless posts.
---
Contact Xbox about it - advise them that you used an Xbox card to make a purchase but the product was not supplied. 
---
Send in a ticket to Beth advising them of the issue (be very straight but polite with them), and advise them that you are contacting Xbox to notify them of fraud.
---
If you can keep on buying them you can use serums each hour to get rid of the negatives and keep the positives, therefore you can get rid of class freak
---
5pm BST (I hope!)
---
honestly. im just excited to not need to equip and unequip hacker and lockpick perk cards.
---
I tried farming queen runs however it‚Äôs typically only me and my one friend trying to do the event meant for a whole server, since earl came out a lot of people don‚Äôt even come to do Queen with us anymore
---
Even if this did happen, a month later we'd see the same post complaining about the weekly limits.
---
Taking out people with wanted tags counts.
---
I don‚Äôt care for PvP either - the 2 kills I have toward that trophy were both the same person - both times, he was wanted and was looking for someone to remove the wanted status.
---
They should Just remove the daily limit of 150. thats all it takes imo to fix this problem.
---
Some time ago I met the insult bot and... well they forgot to run the voice actor's voice through the filter and I just ended up hearing some dude with a sexy voice insulting me. (I recorded it, if anyone's interested I'll give you a link)
---
Edit: here's the vid:  https://youtu.be/OYHebrV3Buk
---
It's in German though (joke roughly translates to " The prices in your C.A.M.P. are outrageous! The only thing worse to ever happen was your conception!")
---
You have to do some sneaky fetch quest stuff around the map. Get two secret key cards, use them in the right place to get a secret door to unlock that has a code, etc. It's not too taxing. The fallout wiki will tell you where each key is. There are three TNT bunkers that have stuff in them, one has the blaster ammo and the schematic to convert to fusion cells, one has the T-51b Nuka Cola skin, and the last has the X-01 Quantum skin.
---
Or you can just get a buddy who has opened them previously to let you in. I think that works.
---
I can't wait to GET RID OF ALL THESE PERKS CARDS!!!
---
Have you tired Daily OPs?  That's one thing that is going to keep my interest.
---
What I‚Äôm saying is that chart assumes the bloodied empties a clip and the quad empties a clip and compares the dps. Of course the quad is going to be higher it‚Äôs firing far more rounds than the bloodied. In the time it takes to reload the bloodied 2 times would it not be close to the fire time of the quad?  I know from using a quad and a bloodied both ffr and modded the same I‚Äôd take the bloodied every time
---
Don‚Äôt be disingenuous. Saying that people don‚Äôt really care because they won‚Äôt look up how to log a ticket, or post on the official forums, is victim blaming. 
---
Would it be more helpful if they did? Sure. Is it their responsibility? Absolutely not. This is an old Nuclear Winter bug which the devs never cared to fix, and as a result it‚Äôs spread into seasons. Thinking that they haven‚Äôt been able to nail it down by now because they don‚Äôt have enough tickets is pie in the sky, to say the least.
---
Yall can‚Äôt two man a queen? Hmm well I hadn‚Äôt taken that in to account. But most servers I‚Äôm on do both Earl and the queen after the first Earl fight as he only takes 3-4 minutes to beat then you still have 20+ minutes to kill the queen.
---
Sometimes, I can‚Äôt leave the screen for some reason
---
I think the most accessible community for the game should be talking about issues that disrupt regular play.
---
No, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything new to it. Attack a horde essentially. I want more story, not the same recycled game modes.
---
And let's be real if they did change it to weekly limits people would complain they hit the limit on the first day and have nothing to work for the rest of the week
---
I just imagine those invisibility movies (trying to not reference that Cosby one) where you see random clothes floating by. I know what you're trying to say (clothes that go invisible when the armour's invisibility procs), but I just can't shake the mental image
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Ok. I have 18 packs and 107 levels saves plus a crap load of perks I don‚Äôt use so hopefully can max at least a couple.
---
My best time so far has been just under 7 minutes solo in the burning mine. The easiest method is just to sprint past everything straight to the objectives. The only time this becomes an issue is if you get staggered by something like a mutant hound while trying to activate the signals. That can get you about a minute and a half to kill the boss and still get elder. If you want to optimize time perfectly, you can plan the best route ahead of time, spam nuka colas or other AP regen items, and start running towards the next objective when your current one is almost done (even with a 0x boost it still progresses, just slower)
---
Pretty decent gaslighting attempt. Probably would have worked on someone else.
---
There's already a weapon damage calculator that works out the burst or per-clip damage:
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
I used numbers from there to get the damage per shot for use in the spreadsheet. There is a huge difference between burst and sustained damage output for some weapons so it's worth running the numbers.
---
So is the gutter going to be able to be legendary? And will the whistle in the dark always have the same effects it had from survival? Pretty cool if I can finally scrip mine, I wanted to collect it but it's so heavy for a garbage weapon
---
I have 30 points, should I move them today? what will happen to them? sorry i'm a little new!
---
Try blocker instead of barbarian.
---
If that happens, hold the back button, should take you straight out.
---
what did you complete that challenge now lmao I probably complete it 10 times each day thanks to people like you
---
Yeah exactly, like you said, they are just some visual stuff, nothing that affects anything in the game, same enemies, same spawn rates, no stealth buff or nerf, no increase or decrease in anything like flora or plants. But in nuke zones, there are special spawns like scorched or glowing enemies with nuked enemy inventory.quite often you can find cuked flora way outside of the nuke zone, and (tho now nuke mobs are super less) they would sometimes wander outside and some other normal enemies would wander in the nuke zone.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be changing back to a quad tbh. U can‚Äôt compare dps accurately if your saying clip v clip. Bloodied fires for 2 seconds and then does nothing for the time it takes the quad to empty. Do sustained damage over 20 seconds with both and you‚Äôll see the bloodied is far superior
---
No, they changed it shortly after introducing the Halloween one. You can only have one or the other now.
---
Bethesda's modifications that they decided to rename to the "Creation Engine" might not have been built for multiplayer but the engine that they modified named "Gamebryo" is in fact fully capable of creating multiplayer games ranging from co-operative (Civilization IV) to MMO (Warhammer Online).

Underrated comment üôè
---
I started playing only for the ghillie suit and stayed because it‚Äôs fun. All of my friends in Fallout 76 are people I met playing NW. On pc, almost everyone with a mic is chill and nice. I now spend more time in NW than adventure mode, since adventure mode has become stale and repetitive.
---
Thanks for sharing. I didn‚Äôt know about those bobblehead spawn points in Flatwoods. Regarding your perks, I would spec more for one weapon than two.
---
30 points?  Do you mean the perk points?
---
Wouldn't get rid of any lag if they were just hidden away. They have to be completely gone
---
I feel the exact same way. I've been playing since the open beta and the Legendary Run exhausted my interest, so I've been looking forward to a long break.
---
Good suggestion, but it will take forever to get the the trophy that way.  I rarely see people with wanted tags...maybe once a week.
---
Well I'll be damn. This is the most sensible thing I've read on the internet lol. Very solid point.
---
Imagine if it WAS the best gun in the game and everyone would play a pistol build because of it. You can‚Äôt make this shit up folks.

Back in the days of survival mode I got this done. But it‚Äôs pretty annoying. I played hunted hunted for the first time yesterday the other guy got lucky but I killed him back. It‚Äôs a weird one to get tbch
---
üòÇgreat post
---
I just caution mass action of converting cards. I initially did that in the PTS and then as I saw the different Daily Ops and what it takes to be successful I regretted scrapping my melee perks. Also, One Wasteland will impact a lot of builds and I'm guessing there will be a lot of respeccing. I'd suggest playing for a few days before you get rid of the majority of your Perk Points for cards.
---
Gotta go Rambo full crowd control
---
Yes please.
---
where did you hear stealth is useless?
---
I really wanted to pick Far-Flung Fireworks, but it seems that it sucks just like most explosive related things in this game.
---
I really wish that Bethesda did a serious balance pass on Explosives in general, stuff like grenades, mines, fatmans, etc are just so weak it's ridiculous.
---
Their community managers check the subreddit 1-2 days around updates and that's it. They get their data from their official forums, PTS feedback, and support tickets. This subreddit is a giant circlejerk that prides itself on being far more important than it really is. When we got the first handmade skin or the fridges/player vendors that were in the files since launch, this subreddit thought that they were the reason bethesda introduced it
---
Is it an oversight or do you think it's inteded? Because yeah, if that's the case I'd rather not invest that much, I'd either multiclass to use the lever action as well for normal play and min max for other stuff or invest in more useful stuff, hell I'd even take reload speed at this point
---
Similar to what some people did/do with the revive an ally scout challenge, another alternative is to coordinate with another player you trust, and kill each other until you both get to 20.
---
I have saved almost 100 level ups and 30 perk card packs for tomorrow. I‚Äôm level 320 and should be able to get 6 legendary perk cards. I know I will be spending most on the ammo one because I love ammo. Lol
---
Stealth will take a hit and also the new daily OPs require different methods depending on the modifiers (i.e increased enemy perception, bash to kill etc).
---
I wouldn't worry too much and would focus more on the new Legendary perk system.
---
I've two-manned Earle in PTS and for whatever reason, I haven't noticed much of a difference with him.
---
The SBQ is a *tank* though.  The only thing that balances it out is that cripples work again, so at least you have a means of keeping her grounded.
---
The resource expenditure is what's going to get most players, I think.  Even just running the silos, I have to expend something like 4-6 bullets per Laser Turret.  They don't even do anything - they just sit there and tank damage.  So I always walk out of the silo 300 bullets poorer, since robots don't replace my 5.56 with anything, and then I have to go into a Queen battle where you don't have that contextual ammo thing the Wendigo Spawn have.  It's just a drain on ammo, and I don't really see the point in doing it when we have Earle now.
---
And then melee versus bosses is just awful.  What was once 7,000 damage struggles to reach 200-300.  So you don't have that to fall back on to save on ammo either.  I mean, you could sit there and facetank the Queen and earn credit, but why?  When you can sit back at a nice, safe distance and deal the same damage as a Commando in half the time?
---
Course, you can end up ahead ammo-wise with Daily Ops too, and there's the Legendary Perk for ammo.  And there *are* other ways of dealing with the turrets.
---
I was on PTS quite awhile ago so i don't know if this still holds true. I had the gutter plan drop for me and when crafting it (costs two legendary modules) the outcome was just normal The Gutter (which has build in effects like in the fixer), the same one you get from the questline, no additional effects rolled on it. Now.. Did they change that after i have last been on PTS i do not know. Does learning it add it to loot pool and can it drop after as legendary like fixer? Don't know, but highly suspect so.
---
i heard in daily ops stealth doesnt work.  Angry turts says.
---
Oh yeah I like your idea more than how it currently works, I think the storm slowly rolling through the wasteland would be incredible to both see and take part in
---
you "worked"? what did you do exactly instead of playing a video game ?
---
100% agree. Throwing an explosive at the feet of an enemy basically feels like throwing a toaster at them.
---
The comment I replied to was about the ultra casual having significantly reduced damaged, I'm only saying this isn't likely to be the case. I'm more worried about the max level mutants st Grafton Dan and Max level scorched at slocum's Joe etc than soloing end game bosses.
---
Hmm. I guess the stack of 50 antibiotics wouldnt be that useful anymore  lol
---
Fix what? Who says its broken?
---
You step inside, and it does the animation with the robotic arms too

Multiclass and min max...a person of culture I see.

there is already enough weapon in game I don't give fuck if they are powerfull or week like I said because they are not powerfull that doesn't mean they are not exist
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that I personally am happy the enemies are going to be more of a challenge which will mean I enjoy the game more but I appreciate that this is only my opinion
---
The spreadsheet calculates damage over time, factoring in time spent reloading (damage per clip divided by time per clip, including reload time, gives you sustained damage per second). So the dps number it generates is an exact comparison assuming you are firing multiple clips with both weapons. Bloodied is better if you're firing 1 clip or less. Quad is better if you're firing multiple clips. You will see bigger damage numbers popping up with the bloodied so it might feel more effective, but against Earl you are 15% better off with a quad as a bloodied stealth commando.
---
Edit - Or will be. I just made this spreadsheet so I used additive buffs rather than multiplicative since those only apply for another day or so. Pre nerf the bloodied is probably better. Both fire rate and clip size are inherently multiplicative buffs so they do really well after the nerf.
---
Awesome, pretty sure the devs were hoping most players would end up doing stuff like this eventually.
---
One day you will be able to play as a Ghoul or Super Mutant... One day....
---
Yeah being I have every color or variant to t60 but I don‚Äôt use t60

---
I had him tell me I was ugly and then he reminded me that my entire family was dead.  All while I was crouched in the ruins of a shed hiding from a mirelurk king.  His timing is impeccable.
---
haha fits in very well. But purveyor should get mad at us, and not give discount for killing them
---
it works everywhere else
---
Daily Ops and One Wasteland are two different things. Stealth isn't helpful in DO, that's true.
---
No idea but I would assume so unless it‚Äôs bugged , 2 decent rolls for your alt though I love having both handmades and combat rifles as you can swap to whatever ammos handiest
---
I understood that the One Wasteland patch would be applied on September 15, at which point, low level enemies may become a thing of the past.
---
Yes the ammo factory is amazing!  I wasn't keen on master infiltrator but after seeing rank 1 adding +3 to all locking and hacking skills (no need for those perk cards anymore) i'm sold!

Its generous we will get 6 slots.  Ive also saved loads of cards to scrap :)  I think ill be going for..

* ammo factory rank 3

* rank 1 master infiltrator

* Funky duds

I agree about wanting more story, this is what it is , I would have chosen content over this but Im happy with these changes
---
Ah that's disappointing. Its base effect is essentially vampire's, but they could have done something like the thorn armor and just removed that one effect from its pool. Not like that weapon is good enough to need the handicap. Hopefully things are changed but we shall see tomorrow
---
They fixed the codes because they were broke. Nothing to do with reddit. Everyone does know there are other forms of media right?
---
Edit: SORRY SORRY! YOU ARE ALL RIGHT! IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF REDDIT!  You're wives must all be proud of yous.
---
thats going to be amazing and annoying mostly annoying
---
We think.
---
There's nothing to say they don't have a build beyond what's in the PTS with some extra tweaked numbers.  But it's likely the same... otherwise they would have experimented a lot more with the numbers in the PTS.
---
This is something that generally bothered me about this PTS.  Outside of the Alien Blaster and acknowledging the bug with Unarmed damage, I don't think they tweaked a single damage number since it started.  Apparently, they must either believe they got it all right the first time (yeah, right), or that their player base is super patient and will take their word for it when they say the rest is coming later (yeah... right).
---
They are just numbers.  Why wouldn't you take the time to iterate on them while you have a captive testing audience like that?
---
I hate building of flat places. We need less restrictions on building... Its like every object in the game has a 25% bigger hitbox.
---
[stealth isnt useless](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iqvs03/tldrish_on_tuesdays_additive_damage_system/)
---
Sorry post should have /s
---
Disagree. While there's now some advantage to full-health builds, bloodied/unyielding builds are still pretty dominant. It's just hard to give up the +15 to all your stats minus endurance.
---
Legendary Charisma does not work as intended. It doesn't allow you to share higher level perk cards. I tested this many, many times in the PTS. As did many others.
---
EDIT: Also, I'm pretty sure Follow Through and Taking One For The Team do stack together.
---
They‚Äôll scale to their maximum allowed lvl when compared to yours. 30 makes 30‚Äôs 130 will still spawn a 68 or whatever lvl is the max for that given creature
---
I didn‚Äôt think about that - your right low level areas do let you whip out your less than stuff to play with
---
I prefer bright, my friend prefers red... We can't use the T-65 power armor or Deep mining mask because they didn't enable light mods.
---
I would focus on your base build first.  Then when you're happy with it I would start saving them up for the legendaries.
---
Check out https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks as they have a sweet build planner.  Welcome to 76 :)
---
Who tf buys repair kits? You get better versions for free just from doing Scorched Earth. I will never run out of them
---
Ok phew, thanks for clearing that up
---
That change was made in the base game a few patches ago. I believe that is intended. Adding, the boost from Unyielding doesn't allow you to share above your base level.
---
The issue is since I last played the rebalancing screwed my build, I used to hit for 4.4k damage per shot as a rifleman and now my damage is only 1.2k, barely hitting 3k with a BE Tesla
---
My first scorchbeast kill was near the pumpkin house.  Trying to fight it at the same time as super mutants and a legendary sheep squatch.  Fun times.
---
I'm trying to think of ways to make it better.
---
Yes that was another awesome plus was the computer and pick lock in one perk card is awesome. I just recently changed my whole build around. Use to just not worry about perk cards back during launch and then when I came back from a 6 month break last October I built my character to carry as much as I could. But I started realizing I was specced to be bloodied being I used the rad perk card and I had a bloodied frog axe and death claw then I got a bloodied 2 star 33 vats combat and that changed it for me. I switched everything around to be a stealth commando and now I have 3 fixers from the lovely purveyor. I can‚Äôt wait to add some points back into perks I took away from. It‚Äôs going to be awesome. Can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow
---
Yep. Didn't write down names. Didn't join a team. Lesson learned.

---
The rebalance hasn‚Äôt been dropped yet. It drops tomorrow. Other than test server that is. But yes after tomorrow we‚Äôll all do less damage and the chances of soloing or two manning the queen will be harder. That‚Äôs why we ground out all those kills now.
---
Do you tend to over feed yourself?
---
That is nice..but ran out of adhesive to repair...lmao hadn't had scrap problems for almost a year on my main.hope this update helps me level my lower acct.kinda excited
---
Yeah I have t65 but I use the vats mod on it but no light mods for it sucks and then excavator I have the commie one and I was hoping to have the light red but at least it‚Äôs has bright. And the mining mask I use because the light is pretty good. But I agree with you
---
Remember when first doing the queen with a load of other people at it and it failed ? It ducked but it did get the juices flowing for the next bout
---
Right, but then what's the point of Legendary Charisma? I would argue that most people would assume it would allow you to share higher level cards.
---
Nope
---
Thanks :)
---
The one that really bugs me is that fast travel nonsense.
---
Just take the power plant workshops or other sought after workshops so people will have incentive to take it, thus giving you a reason to kill them. That's what I've done
---
Good point. It does say +CHR and +CHR perk points. I'll update, thank you!
---
Am I wrong in thinking something like Legendary Strength is going to be a great card that is potentially useful to all characters?
---
No you.
---
Look it is Bethesda , and as we all know things they introduce have been know to not quite work right ( and totally destroy things that were already working fine) so I imagine there could be a few hiccups
---
Limb-erjack - bonus damage to limbs
---
Just stop being negative. No wonder sometimes I need a break. ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶
---
Not sure, may I as why?
---
Wow so like I said, a serious lack of variety.
---
I'd go into depth but you said you don't care, the fact you said the Enclave Plasma and the Plasma are different, it's the one case of were the devs should actually have just made that a skin.
---
The game can't handle a few ash piles, imagine snow everywhere...lag central :-)
---
Random deaths can occur if you consume things that give you extra HP, Tato salad, Psychobuff, Vodka come to mind. Consume a second with low enough HP before the first one wears off and Adios MoFo.
---
&gt;Bloodied fires for 2 seconds and then does nothing for the time it takes the quad to empty
---
Another way to put it is that the bloodied spends a lot more time not firing compared to a quad, which is bad.
---
If this were a cover based shooter like Mass Effect I'd say that's a good thing because you can duck back into cover while the weapon reloads and avoid damage. But against Earl you're surrounded by melee mobs so it's just... a significant amount of time spent *not* dealing damage.
---
Are the people who complain about the weapon durability not using the gunsmith perk? not tryina be jerk, I have .50 cal as main gun, i legit fix it once in a week or two, about 30-40 repair kits just sitting in my inventory for emergency repair, which never happens cuz i fix it to 200% and i dont even wait for it to go less than 50% condition. I know some energry weapons just made out of chinesium tho
---
I have no idea.
---
All during the PTS, Bethesda never talked to us about these changes or communicated, in any way, what was considered "complete" versus what was still "in progress."  I would say that a 10% card that doesn't actually boost damage by 10% is a pretty dubious thing, but that now applies to most percentages in the game.
---
But as a general rule of thumb, these types of cards, and Bloody Mess, deserve a second look if they are part of your setup.  You would probably be better served investing in crits, or Adrenaline, or something along those lines.
---
Far more than I enjoy bugs that should have been fixed after several months have passed.
---
If you only play for the 10 minutes a day it takes to do your Daily Op, it‚Äôs not worth it.  You can still sneak in the other 99% of the game‚Äôs content.
---
I just assumed Radstorms would be spawned by nukes. Makes sense?
---
They really should up the max level of weapons. They should utilize those last 2 star slots on legendaries too
---
We will probably find out later today what they are going to delay.
---
The notes wording was a bit off. It doesn't stack with others using the same legendary perk. I updated.
---
I'll settle for a wearable Santa hat! Or have they done that before?
---
Its good if you have a heavy gunner which lives in power armor, because it weights almost nothing and you can have unyielding if you need it by just getting out of your pa.
---
oh I see.  I used psycobuff when I was a junkie and mistakenly used it the other night.  I was going the psyco and clicked the wrong one.  Lost all my unyielding stats.  You know I also drank vodka, so use to popping chems and alcohol.  Thanx man.
---
I already hit my max caps last night again with a lot of sale legendaries in my vendor.  Not sure what to do, there‚Äôs nothing left to spend my caps on. Lol
---
lol im sitting here doing less than 50 dmg with my heavy .50 cal  
---
if you can sitll do 1K damage per shot, you should be able to take down SBQ in 2-3 magazines... Especially solo, where no other player can break your stealth.
---
If you are very low health and are "well fed" once you lose the well fed bonus, the lost of bonus health it gives you can kill you.
---
Cries in console
---
It happens my man, that‚Äôs tough
---
No such thing as overkill. Justenoughkill
---
You get Tenderizer, and you get Tenderizer, everybody gets Tenderizer!
---
Yeah Reddit‚Äôs going to be going ballistic as I‚Äôm typing this I‚Äôm chuckling , some people have excellent prose when there in that rage zone, so many people are going to be ranting , like the people who got ban waved recently (and them welcomed back) and were going to take bethesda to court
---
Maybe not strength, but the extra perk points for any of the Legendary SPECIALs will be a rather big deal.
---
I dont see the fun in a PvP where level gap is a thing and you can see other people on the map all the time , but well, everyone has their own thing
---
I was quietly hoping for cross play...even if just with PC and Xbox users.
---
I think there's a work around if you have a private server or know someone who does. There's probably people here that would be willing to help out as well
---
Especially considering that submitting a ticket about this specific issue does absolutely nothing. Bethesda refuses to adjust points when it happens simply because they don't want to. If more people complain about it *anywhere*, it should get moved up the priority list for fixing it (at least for any normal dev team, with Bethesda who knows). Asking people not to post about it is asking for the bug to just get ignored and never get fixed.
---
You get level 100 SMs knocking about with glitched laser rifles that will one shot you, that's enormous fun :-)
---
Nope.
---
But enemies will.
---
They would screw everyone who grinded for decent Equipment until now.
---
Maybe. While you can't go past 15 in the perks it does appear to boost the effects of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. beyond 15, so additional carry weight and the extra damage isn't terrible.
---
I don‚Äôt pick on low levels if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre worried about. They‚Äôre usually way higher level than me and they‚Äôre never a lot lower. And after level 70 or so, you should have a complete build.
---
Nuclear winter kills count towards this achievement. I was in the same situation with this keeping me away from the platinum trophy. I only needed two more kills and got them in the same NW match last week.
---
Snow machine, reskin of smoke machine. simple enough of a solution for bethesda
---
Ug, that is pitiful lol. I was looking forward to running around with my instigating super sledge laying waste to swaths of wendigo spawns but... I guess not.
---
You can almost always TAB back to the previous screen in  terminals
---
He‚Äôs not doing that against the queen or earl because of their damage resistance. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what he meant. Even Tyre and Captain noob only get in the 700s on the queen and that‚Äôs maxed out Chems, food and all buffs.
---
On the subject of levels in the new update, will every area level up with us or will some areas remain low level? ü§î
---
Nah, Suppressor for everyone. team mates cant die if the enemy deals less damage.
---
I can't speak for anyone else, but Gunsmith hasn't been working properly for me, lately.
---
They‚Äôll be level 50-100, won‚Äôt go above that
---
Lol I dropped about 1,500 scrip and got absolute garbage.  Nothing I can use, all going in my vendor, scrip, or selling at vendors.  Unfortunately I am at max caps and stash so kind of screwed.
---
Ranking up the cards is pretty wonky tho
---
Reddit‚Äôs just going to be a wall of hate , if I was Bethesda‚Äôs paren‚Äôt I wouldn‚Äôt let then get access to social media for the next few weeks
---
I don't think that would be a good idea.  
---
New character or alt, that is the easiest way to get them. I quit going once I have replaced all my armor and maybe a weapon if needed. By 20 give or take a few levels I leave it alone so others can take advantage of it. I have seen many times where I'll get one wolf leader and one legendary only for some 350+ to snag the other two before I can do anything about it. I fail the following one as it too nets one.  
---
IMO and experience it was made for low level players not higher ones.  
---
However, as of tomorrow all areas will be somewhat new regarding enemies.
---
Great post. Thanks for the heads up!
---
The only thing I have a problem with is the daily scrip limit. 150 is a big joke especially with the sale with the pervaor, Make the daily scrip limit 300 so I have more chances to use scrip and not be overweight that's the basics of my daily login go to the pick scrap all my legendary that makes me overweight then do the 3 dailies for the crater, foundation, and overseer the hit up the gold bullion machine then do a couple nuke drops on mine then im done for the day dosen't take more than 3 hours.
---
But you could transfer a point from strength to something else right?
---
are you dreaming of a white Christmas?
---
I like the change. This offers a lot more possibilities,  besides, this does not change a lot of things: instead of massively overkilling npcs we just kill them.It's fine
---
This isn't comparable. It would be more similar to the toxic valley
---
I was thinking of using "What Rads?" as a non-power armor wearing melee build to be able to eat rads in nuke zones, but it sounds like the rads will still be too potent in the zone for me to compete with...? 
---
Can anyone elaborate on "Brawling Chemist" as a perk for a melee build? This seems like one I should strongly consider. I am already a STR 15 so I unfortunately can't use the "Legendary Strength" perk.  
---
TIA...
---
Is this not intended behavior? Shouldn't it work the same way that stat points from armor or weapons would work? I don't understand how this is a bug. The only points that count for equipping and sharing perks are the ones you distribute from leveling. That's how it's always worked...?
---
my deepest apologies because my first thought in reading your post is that i truly hope you are in fact the only person this bug affects
---
Absolutely. But then you could just take the legendary in that category I suppose.
---
PA doesn't withstand teslas well without a very specific build to do so.
---
Haha ü§£
---
Right on. takes so long to scroll through to change some cards like scrapper and travel agent I don‚Äôt bother sometimes and do without the benefits
---
Why regret scraping melee?
---
Yeah, took me a bit, but I figured that out. Haha 
---
Love the idea anyway.
---
If you really want to see how it affects you, go [here](http://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) and input your weapon, effects, perks, mutations, etc. Look at your damage and see what you should be getting now. Then switch it to additive and see what your new damage is. Then remember that every enemy will be getting even tougher for you with One Appalachia.
---
So good! And congrats!!
---
Not really, this would be an overlay on top of existing rendered terrain
---
Hell yeah brother. Don't you love the fact that with free respeccing you have the ability to fuck around in pve, and min maxing when you wanna do "harder" events?
---
Can it? I swear I did just that and always went down to 1 hp instead
---
It would be much easier to just change the texture of the already existing Ground and change the stepping sounds.
---
Well...&gt;!In the PTS one of the daily ops requires a melee weapon to actually kill the aggressors.!&lt;
---
Yeah I mean testing damage numbers on a behemoth, against queen the highest I‚Äôve hit for was only something like 340ish while borrowing some armor from a friend
---
I use gunsmith but solo bosses a lot and occasionally hit Earle or the queen in the private server. The thing is were going to be using a lot more ammo now and gunsmith just isn't cutting it as it is
---
lol, that's not easy
---
Also make the ammo drop mechanics in daily ops and colossus work for core type ammo!
---
You can drop them to 1 life than gun bash them.
---
Yeah. Typed armor is grand when you know what you‚Äôll be dealing with. I love running my pistol character in Encryptid with full Troubleshooter armor.
---
Some of the blades definitely seem Chinese in origin, but the plasma blade is just... well, completely sci-fi.
---
It does sort of make sense in regards to the 'techno-knight' theme of the BoS.
---
From the test server I'd say you have to sacrifice like 80+ levels worth of perk cards to max out one legendary perk
---
Thanks for the reply man. Yeah not really in a position to get fallout 1st rn but if anyone could help out on ps4 it would be really appreciated! I dont have much in the way of stuff to trade, but i dont mind helping out with missions or stuff if needed
---
Yep, I have bloody mess too. Adrenaline also, I love it! I mean it's strange how they did this changes, meh.
---
Thanks a lot for the insights :)
---
Maybe this time its asked will be the one?!
---
I landed a Bloodied Handmade w/25% VATS and promptly sold it for 20K caps. 
---
I should have quit while I was ahead. Probably burned through 1500 scrip in a few days and got nothing close to it
---
You're being illogical by trying to compare stackables, which were more easily duped into the tens of millions, to fixers which had to be duped one by one. IIRC collectrons and scorched didn't pick up large handmade holiday gifts, which are the problem, and I doubt you have 1000 of legit. Removing the cap drops means the gifts still exist, why are you comparing that, to actually deleting a weapon? Bethesda can just remove the cap drops from the large handmade gifts and you can keep the caps from you're trash tier presents.
---
If the quad was doing close to the damage the bloodied was per shot I‚Äôd agree. It‚Äôs a little over half. A reload isn‚Äôt long and I‚Äôd say you‚Äôd get 2 reloads or 3 clips out to the quads four in the same time. Besides outside of Earle or the queen it‚Äôs a pointless equasion anyway because everything dies stupidly fast with a bloodied and as we both know the damage is in the build for the most part not the gun
---
Inspirational if they‚Äôre below level 100 is my go to on my Team Leader alt.
---
Yes, that makes sense for boosting your Charisma via Unyielding Armor, etc. 
---
The problem here is that Legendary Charisma boosts your PERK SLOTS as well as the stat itself. So, if you have 9 Perk Points in Charisma, and the game says you can't share a level 3 Perk Card, then there is no point in getting Legendary Charisma. 
---
The unique bonus Charisma has doesn't apply to the Legendary Perk boost, despite the fact that it boosts your Perk Points and your Stat
---
I've had the Fixer plan forever, and have not gotten even one yet.
---
It certainly use to, I've not read anything to say it's changed. But I make a point of never going well fed on my bloodied.
---
Doesn't work on possum exams unfortunately, as in yes it will take you back but correcting your answer won't count, learnt it the hard way when I accidentally missclicked
---
Yeah but I see a lot of comments saying how time consuming the Ammo Converter is, sure it needs improvement but it's not THAT bad if you use this method.
---
I believe the built in rad resistance from PA, hazmat suits, and chinese stealth suits greatly exceeds any buff provided by any other boost. The legendary perk will help, but not by much. Outside of Nuke Zones, it's pretty effective.
---
What are you asking specifically about Brawling Chemist? The document lays it out.
---
Let‚Äôs see when tomorrow comes. I‚Äôm not thinking a weapon with a 90% damage buff against a weapon with no damage buff would be outperformed over an Earle fight. For a start the quad is firing a shitload more bullets compared to the bloodied.
---
The difference is that those can push a stat above 15. Legendary Charisma cannot. And the Legendary SPECIAL perks have pretty much been viewed as ‚Äòuse these to replace some base points in that SPECIAL‚Äô. 
---
In other words, if I would prefer to get some extra overall SPECIAL points instead of the benefits of the other legendary perks, this is the trade off. 
---
So if you‚Äôre not getting the same thing as regular special points, then it‚Äôs less beneficial to get Legendary Charisma.
---
The forest will scale to a max of 50 I believe
---
If youre melee and sitting at 15 str, you will still benefit from the legendary str as far as i know. 
---
It may cap your perk creen at 15, but i beleive it will go up to 20 in your pipboy when equiped. So you would still get the carry weight and %damage increase for melee. Just cant equip extra cards.
---
It tells me I need access to see it, FYI! I'm eager to see your work!
---
*affects
---
this almost always happens when the buff that gives HP or the well-fed state disappears, you should use the mutation healing factor, it helps a lot in such situations
---
I never thought of that... Bashing seems so slow when faced with 4-5 SM's crushing you, but it'll be worth a try.
---
Hold on I‚Äôll see if I can fix that! Try it now. Just made it so anyone with the link can view
---
r u fucking kidding me?  im usually very congenial in my posts, but come the fuck on.  u want unfettered positivity,, go to r/fo76FilthyCasuals/

so we, the goddamn fans, come to OUR reddit (not beths) to complain and you want to stop the posts holding the firm accountable for their bullshit half-ass games as a *service* model?
---
downvote those posts, or reply snarkily (as i have), but dont ever, ever,, ever tell people they can't complain,, esp when its a legitimate gripe!   this is our reddit, and we can bitch about whatever the fuck we want on here.   im going over to r/kittens to calm down for a bit; fucking goddamn piece of shit furball turd furguson kittens, i just want to hug them with my teeth!
---
In that particular Daily Op, because the legendary effect of the enemy was that it saw through stealth. I don‚Äôt believe that means that ALL Daily Ops will have enemies with that feature. I could be wrong, though. 
---
Either way, it‚Äôs just in Daily Ops, not the whole game.
---
I remember when people thought nuclear winter was gonna be a snow event. But yeah snow would be cool.
---
Really that i such a weak ass argument, you think I bitched and moaned that my thunderfury became useless when the expansion hit in WoW?   
---
Wastelanders should have moved guns to 60 any new expansion should move item levels up. It keeps a grind going.
---
No he was saying that your stealth build won't work. They will be able to see you. So grab a power armor.
---
I wish they would go into  a "downed"/injured state when brought to 1 life rather than keep on truckin like nothings wrong.
---
^
---
I don't want positivity, I want logic and common sense.
---
We're not all running the most optimized builds we can come up with, and for those of us who are some of us have been expecting a nerf like this for a long time because it's completely normal for it to happen in online games. The meta game is constantly shifting.
---
Plus I wouldn't call it a butcher. I'm not hearing anything about being unable to complete content. Just that it has become a little longer to do so and a little heavier on resources. We're being compensated with lengendary perk cards that increase ammo production, give us with free chems, etc. Unless I'm mistaken the result is will be a net positive not negative.
---
YES! That would be amazing. I'd take a perk for that effect!! lol
---
All fixed! I can see it now, thanks!

Ive reached end game about 2-3 weeks ago and these limits fucking KILL my will to play. The gold limit makes me want to scream to the moon and back. My stash is full of junk 3 stars waiting their turn. Its beyond ridiculous.

---
Does he give you 100 pre war money? Im killing him as soon as I see him so i dont know
---
It's kind of like playing roulette, then moving to a different table because you get the idea another table is more likely to pay out. It isn't, but it *feels* like it is.
---
What happens is you get another seed, but you have no way of knowing what your seed is going to give you until after the fact. It's a likely to harm your odds as it is improve them, but it has a 100% chance of making you sit thru more loading screens.
---
I see! Ty :)
---
We don't have the need for better weapons and armor. We need stronger enemies at first.
---
I got killed by rads the other day while clearing out that workshop in the bottom of the Savage Divide, as I was picking a place to respawn I suddenly wondered why I was hearing a protectron walking around. So I closed back to the idle screen and there he was.
---
The insult bot...insulting my corpse. I was speechless.
---
I think its time to move my camp back up on seneca rocks lmao
---
True, there are many different textures
---
But they did't need to do it this way, OR that way.  They could have, and should have taken thier time to fix it all at once, or at WORST fix the part that would be fun for players first, not just nerf everyone with no time table on when the actual balancing is going to happen.
---
I made like 7k yesterday and used all of it on 2 Earle fights. It took me more time to make it than use it.
---
Thanks.  I didn't even think of NW.  I'll have to start playing it.
---
The fallout wiki page for the mission has a workaround for the bug iirc
---
Oh okay, I understand now. I thought the Legendary was just extra points. But if it allows you to equip more cards then the Charisma should work to share higher level cards. But it doesn't.
---
Another question - do any of the other jukeboxes around the map play that music from West Virginia lumber? I've never heard it at any of the others...it's pretty unique.
---
This is the only right answer. Reports make shareholders happy, and shareholders are the people who eventually decide to pull the plug on this. Shareholders see big numbers = game gets to live another day.
---
lol it's both.  SOME bonuses, but not fully optimized.  Anyone with a affix weapon almost certainly has stacking bonuses, there is room between fully kitted out and nothing at all.
---

It's energy damage, isn't it?  X01 PA has an energy resistance of 450
---
Patrolling the Appalachia makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
Come to think of it, this seems like something the Shi would develop, whenever they actually establish themselves enough to make them.
---
Exactly this. As an added bonus it would soft nerf legacies
---
The terminal's current interface creates an insanely high number of screens that have to be backed out of individually. For cases like you mentioned, and for that matter if you've made more than a few transactions, it's generally faster to just leave the terminal and open it up again.
---
I will try It, thanks!
---
I haven't used PA much and it's too slow for what I'm used to.  
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper and the way I like to approach many games. I'm quite good at it. My 2nd char is a shotgun only build and I can't do that.  
---
IMO it's bad enough having to manage food/water, gear, and then PA needs.
---
What I would want more is combined caps and scrip on the whole account. If I have 5 characters, it should be max caps/scrip and daily limit would 5 times higher but they share it. So I can turn in on any character, and go to the purveyor on any character.
---
ER/DR barely matter in PvP.
---
Try moving your actual camp unit around and spawning into your camp. When im placing mine down I usually have a team mate spawn in just so I can see where they show up and plan my build from there
---
You will get bullion at the end of the wastelanders quest lines but you can trade guns for scrip at any stage. You can trade up to 150 in value per day and spend it at the rusty pick on legendary item rolls, I‚Äôd suggest waiting till your level 50 if you can to prolong the use of anything you might get
---
I do the same, sometimes I don't even turn them in for scrip as I stoped caring about murmur as she seems to hate me/ or think I really love 3* zealots
---
The way damage is now calculated makes it so instead of multiplicative damage increase its additive.
---
&gt; is what Bethesda need for their reports.
---
Not working at all.

Gauss Shotguns just don't work well on scorchbeasts. HOWEVER, I have an instigating gauss shotgun myself, and it kills most other things in 1-3 shots, regardless of VATS or cards being used. Like I have a pretty decent chance of one shotting high level deathclaws without VATS, and with VATS they never survive.
---
Also, you have to charge the shotgun. It doesn't take long. Mine is 25% FFR, so I think it might charge faster though.
---
rank 4 all 6 SPECIAL perks = 30 useable perk points once you drop say STR to 10 and such. It effectively makes you character a level 80 for special and I can see it being the number one go to for true min/max you could in theory have 15 str 8 Perception 15 endurance 3 charisma 15 int 15 agi 15 luck.  (or any combo you want)  This is huge for QoL life perks making straight builds much stronger across the board along with solid gimmicks added or if you role play.   
---
Even just taking 5 and using one of the "fun" perks is still game changing.
---
You mean after the update? Or only when doing an actual daily ops ? Also what are the daily ops by themself? Like daily raids?
---
I enjoy doing Events and shooting tones of ammo hence I am thinking about getting an Ammo Factory. Seems right, right? With it I would move to ultracite ammo
---
Thanks for the summary
---
Exactly - as you're limited on the number of small vault-tec generators that can be built so you can't get close to 100 power on them, i think \~75-80 tops which may limit your lighting/powered base options
---
Change how durability works also. Durability works now based on how many times damage is done and not by shots fired. This means splitter weapons break 5X faster than a non-splitter, Two shot Explosive breaks 4X faster than a normal weapon, hitting a group with an explosive weapons causes more durability damage than hitting a single target. All of these need to change in addition to durability increases on weapons.
---
This would fit perfectly with The new damage calculations.
---
He does, he gave me a silver locket lest time.
---
Just checked this thanks. I think its getting fixed in the patch so i might just wait it out

The sympto-matic is an auto doc. Don't know why they didn't just called it an auto-doc. But it looks and functions like the biometric scanner from the nuke silos.

Cheers mate
---
I didn't know...the nuke was loaded...and I'm soooo sorry, my friend...
---
Start by going to tinkers workbench, you will need
---
10 steel, 2 rubber, 2 glass, 1 leather, to build a bike.
---
Then go to missile silo, make sure to bring 40 adhesive. 
---
Tape bike to the top of the nuke, lastly run the silo and launch the nuke.
---
Btw I‚Äôm not sure this is the most efficient way to launch a bike, maybe using something like a ramp, in which case at least you will get the bike back. 
---
Good luck!
---
Do the perks requiring a matching set work with power armor?
---
I created a 2nd character and transfer a lot of it via my wife‚Äôs character (drop it with my main, she picks it up and drops it to my new character). Boom, now I have a mule who‚Äôs sole purpose is a 2nd stash box.

I don't get it.
---
Snow Will most likely not happen. But maybe it could be snowing but its just too watery to sit on the ground
---
Ah the good ol insult bot. I have 3 of his insulted papers and I usually put them in a bag if I give out stuff to low levels or I drop in a propaganda flyer.
---
I don't know if this is how Bethesda is planning on handling it but for at least one of the MMOs I have played they will nerf the hell out of every player and then make adjustments to that after the nerf has launched bringing it back up to a more reasonable level. I'll wait to pass judgement on the state of the game until we've seen more than just one patch.
---
You can also shove that accusation into Fissure Prime.  I‚Äôm not the only one that used this method. There were even multiple YT videos about it.  
---
I never said I had 1000+ **Large** Holiday Gifts. I said 1000+ Gifts. You need to check your assumptions.
---
And I never said they were all Standard either. I bought wrapping paper (all three kinds) over and over from all the vendors.  And that was *after* selling stuff to clear out the vendor caps. Then buy the wrapping paper, sell more stuff to get back the caps (25% rate).  So a good number of those 1000 were Handmade Gifts. 
---
I worked the system *within the system*.  I‚Äôve never supported or advocated duping in this game or any other multiplayer game. Find ways to earn it instead of cheating. 
---
The comparison is perfectly valid. You want to remove a benefit from all of ‚ÄòX Items‚Äô because a portion of them were duped, even though this would negatively impact even the legitimate players and their legitimate items. 
---
Whether you replace ‚ÄòX Items‚Äô with ‚ÄòLarge Holiday Gifts‚Äô or ‚ÄòBloodied 25/25 Handmades‚Äô, the premise is the same. 
---
Instead of punishing just the players that violated the rules, you want to punish the entire group. 
---
That‚Äôs a Scorched Earth approach.  And it‚Äôs not something I support. 
---
Removing anything from the gifts is a bandaid. They already did it with scrip. That didn‚Äôt affect the legendary gear economy. So doing it with caps would be just as worthless. 
---
Bethesda has a responsibility to enforce the rules in their own game. Letting them off the hook with just a ‚Äòremove the caps‚Äô is a poor decision. 
---
Especially since there is *still* a legitimate in-game, no-dupe, no-hack, nothing-involving-gifts/pails method to get infinite caps.
---
This proposal would simply hurt those with legitimate gifts/pails and the dupers would move to another method to generate infinite caps.
---
That makes it a bad plan.
---
Do all Daily Ops have that legendary enemy effect?
---
Actually, I heard Robert Smigel loves Skyrim and he offered to write lines for free. 
---
It‚Äôs true, because I made it so in my brain.
---
I would love snow ! Even horrifically radioactive snow that gives diseases and mutations should you play in it too long!
---
Even just some extreme weather would be nice.
---
I think the only weapon people should "graduate" out of is pipe weapons, and maybe not even then.  I'd love to see some weirdly conditioned build that made gave pipe weapons some special function.  I wanna see people working as a team with different weapon types in tandem.  Cryolator and light melee should be good for debuffing, flamer should be good for crowd control, heavy melee should damage armor so someone with a missle launcher can drop in and do massive damage, energy and ballistic and rad defenses on monsters need to be more relevant and situational to make combat more than just aim at thing and unload till it falls over.      
---
I know that's all a lot to hope for, so I would be more than happy with weapons getting a DPS/ammo balance so that everything is more even, to let people actually choose what kind of weapon they want to use rather than having to shoehorn their end game builds into two or three options.
---
I don‚Äôt understand your thinking. You turn in a weapon for a currency (scrip) to purchase something else. You turn in a treasury note for a currency (bullion) to purchase something else. The only difference is the daily limit 150 vs 200. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the daily limits on both need to be raised. 
---
If you feel like you holding on to too many garbage legendaries, pop ‚Äòem in a vendor until you get an opportunity to scrip ‚Äòem.
---
But we have daily boring quests from crater and foundation, are they gonna be more exciting
---
If they gave certain mobs Legendary Weapons I am so pumped for that. Anti-Armor, Instigating, and Executioners would be so incredibly powerful against players.
---
Yes, enemies will have modifiers like legendaries and you can get rewards at the end that only come from those ops. I believe there is a post floating around here detailing what the rewards entail
---
Oh shit. You can do that? I guess I have FO3 burned into my brain, I would expect to hear that awful ‚Äúyou fucked up and lost karma‚Äù sound if I were to shoot.
---
The no-stealth thing is *only* in Daily Ops, but another change for commandos that I haven't seen people mention is &gt;!concentrated fire rank 3 has been over performing for the longest time, on the PTS it no longer makes hit chance go up by 20% per shot, now it's a lot smaller increase per shot. I'll be using my +33 vats chance for farming!&lt;
---
Not gonna lie,ghost riding  my bike into the creek as a kid was one of my favorite things too do,
---
until I had too mow enough lawns &amp; shovel enough driveways to buy my own...
---
Then it lost its fun
---
They took away the scrip a while ago. Was that what you were referencing?
---
Dayyyyyum!
---
I just started doing this couple months back on my private server. But now I have my main maxed stash and all 4 alts all max stash and about 800 carry weight on them. I usually just sell stuff to vendor bots when I can after I use all daily scrip limit: but god they need to give us something. Scrip vouchers or something
---
25 posts about this per day, and still people dont spend 10 seconds searching, but mindlessly spam with yet another post
---
I found a guy sharing level 5 Adrenaline the other day!
---
My guns already do that?
---
Recall cards, that's about all I can think of.
---
Have you logged out back to main menu and then logged right back in to your private world? I do this on a private and can get 4-6 farming runs in before the nuke dissipates. 
---
Sometimes, the ghouls will all be dead the first time, so just do above and they will respawn.
---
That‚Äôs God tier
---
Naa, jut that caps are useless to dupers.
---
Lmao dont feel bad!
---
I can't wait to scrap some of my maxed out cards so I can then max out and use my animated perk cards.
---
Yeah I saw it, nothing seems to really grab my attention from it but we'll see when we get it
---
Yes. its perhaps slightly better than previous version but thats it. otherwise its still terrible. in the previous version you could at least see what ammo you had, not blindly try to sell it and get transaction failed error. All they needed for this ammo converter is to have a regular trade menu and instead of caps, you buy and sell with ammo points... And even if they had to use a terminal, I would assume we would set what type of ammo we want to keep, and then with press of a button, we would sell all the unwanted ammo and get points for it.
---
I hope its 5.i did my script about 7pm so it would be nice to cash in again
---
How about be able to buy another body at the shop in Summersville and having an Assaultron companion?
---
I can't believe you got others to join. I have never had anyone else join Hunter Hunted.
---
Core Capacitor - Changes ammo to Fusion cores (200 per core) Allows for continuous firing, lower durability and damage
---
Prime Capacitor - Fires Ultracite beams, Exceptional damage vs Scorched

Prime Core Capacitor - Fires Ultracite beams, Exceptional damage vs Scorched, Changes ammo to Ultracite Fusion cores (200 per core) Allows for continuous firing, lower durability
---
Venting system - User no longer takes radiation damage, lower durability
---
Cooling System -  Increases Durability, Slower charging speed (reload speed)
---
Advanced Detection System - When held, enemies glow red (like the PA targeting hud, can be used to see cloaked enemies)
---
Scrap boxes are the shit. Some folks HATE spending atoms for this stuff, I will gladly buy them.
---
I may load up the mule,sort out the vendor,&amp; afk...
---
D‚Äôoh!
---
Just noticed it‚Äôs 12:25 my time,Nvm
---
Good luck on you though,If I was smart,I woulda had the mule on all morning.
---
Oil Well,lesson learned.
---
hahaha yeaht. that why i said almost. it still takes you back. we still should be able to go back because the results are given at the end.
---
Yeah I've tried that, they don't seem to respawn again till the nuke is nearly over.
---
How long has this game been out? How many patches have we had? What‚Äôs the current state of the game?
---
The slow gear degradation is *only* in the new repeatable Daily Ops missions as far as I know from the PTS
---
So if im a ultracite gatling laser user, not bloodied, will i really see a difference? Because for some reason i only do 4-7 damage per shot on scorchbeast queen/earl , and it really sucks to suck. I have the AA perk and legendary trait on my gun
---
That would be really fun
---
Legendary Special? Nothing if comparing to Uny armor Special boost
---
Ah i see. I wish you could pay more ressources to make it more durable with that little white line. But my gatling laser doesnt need repair that often for some reason
---
Every time I talked to Paige, I couldn't resist being a dick. Worth the hit to rep.
---
Yeah, pretty much. That‚Äôs another valid point. OP‚Äôs idea essentially screws over the handful of people that played fair and does nothing to the ones that cheated.
---
It‚Äôs a short-sighted viewpoint and based upon emotionalism instead of logical thinking.
---
Basically the less damage perks you have, the less of an affect this will have on you. Due to the nature of anti armor, you won‚Äôt be hit quite as hard as myself or a Junkies build would be.
---
The War Glaive looks great
---
If they changed the whole system to match the bullion system I‚Äôd be happy. Let us scrip all day long, but only withdraw the 150 daily limit still.
---
That what the legendary perks are going to do. I‚Äôm guessing even after the patch a good build will still stroll through the game without any challenge...I‚Äôm hopping I‚Äôm wrong,
---
Fair point... if they last longer than 10 minutes.
---
i see. But isnt 300 dmg still doable solo SBQ ?
---
I would love to hear this
---
first i've heard of that
---
That's really interesting with the ricochet perk.
---
Really j just want to turn my legendaries into 0 weight items while maintaining the script amount (like Treasury notes for gold bullion)
---
I don't see a problem  with the coins you scrap unwanted cards for coins and every 5 levels you get an extra 10 coins from the perk pack.
---
It helps clear out unwanted cards so only the ones you use are visible so its easier to swap out perk cards until perk load outs comes
---
I am imagining the pile of shit scene from Jurassic Park. But instead of poop it is ash
---
Mhmm. Also i have glow sights which feels useless since the only thing i kill slowly is scorch queen and earl and they aint glowing
---
I think you should burn in hell for even thinking of snow LOL
---
It was a typo. I ment Haven't played pts sorry i didnt catch it when i posted.
---
Yeah, but ignoring lockpicks and hacking completely is very useful
---
Gear level doesn't mean that much. It's your perk cards and gear legendary effects that matter the most
---
Eh it was not a big deal for my main, but I‚Äôm bloodied HW in PA. A five shot burst would down them, then a quick bash to finish them off wasn‚Äôt too bad. I never felt overwhelmed, but it IS a tanky build. That was running the ops Solo- in a group it‚Äôs likely even easier.
---
Three days in a row i ran into people drop dozens of garbage at the entrance, one time someone even stuffed them in the cash machine next to the window. 
---
The urge to dump is very real
---
I will give that a try , thank you
---
Nice gunüëç
---
If weapons got a new max level it would be disastrous. Literally every single thing we used would suddenly be outclassed and you would have to start a new long grind for the same weapons that‚Äôs just a different level.
---
Honestly I hope this is the first steps to us getting 4 and 5 star drops in the future. But who knows.
---
It happened to me once last season and i learned from my mistake. Simply log off before the dailies reset and it won‚Äôt happen again.
---
That little shit has insulted me 3 times each time Iv been walking into foundation and Iv looked around and Iv never seen him
---
Did you ever figure it out?
---
Any word if this patch will release for xb/ps on the 15th as well? Only since the last patch was about a week behind on consoles.
---
Sad times
---
Edit - when using a scope (short, medium, long, short recon, long recon).
---
Do you have a higher quality photo of this sheet? I try to zoom and and al I get are pixels lol
---
yes.  all will be able to see through your stealth.
---
Yes I don‚Äôt think they should add higher guns but the concept of one wasteland baffles me 
---
It‚Äôs good for high level players but terrible for low level as it makes the 50 level grind harder
---
Same thing I want and they don‚Äôt need to up the daily limit just do vouchers. God it would be so nice to get rid of useless junk. I get that they don‚Äôt want us to roll all day long but this way they don‚Äôt have to let us do that and we can still get rid of all the crap clogging our characters up
---
Welcome to power creep, it's how online games work. If the best stays the best forever, it's a sign of bad game design
---
You uh. You must have never played any massively multiplayer online game before huh?
---
Like the ones we use to know!
---
Great work. But while browsing your "Legendary Effects" section found this..
---
Bloodied: "At 80% / 60% / 40% / 20% health grants + 20% / 40% / 60% / 80% damage boost."
---
That's actually: every 5% lost = 5% increased damage. 5% intervals not 20%, down to 5% health = 95% increased damage.
---
unreadable really
---
have you heard of punctuation ?
---
ive been using alot of anti armor weapons lately, assuming tommorows durability will feel much the same for me
---
Here you go, one dead [Mia](https://imgur.com/N6APmvQ). The above suggestion about making a video is really good though, OBS for example can record too and is free.
---
Are you on a team?
---
If so, does returning to the world playing with the team not put you where you want to be?
---
I got some of the best legendary effects in the game, and it was a pipe revolver. B 25 25.
---
I use to be able to. But then I moved my whole build around to play bloodied stealth commando and took all points away excerpt for 1 point and now I feel bad I can‚Äôt share any cards
---
good point there...and since Beth wants more new players, i suspect there is a piece of this not fully understood yet.
---
Yes I'm on a team, and play with team usually dumps me on a different server entirely, or I can't get back in time to join the event.
---
Same with my B2525 grenade launcher, you scare yourself and then you realise the actual gun
---
Or just go to West tek and grab one from the roof
---
So does the 6 rads it restores per second at max level not work if you are taking rads?
---
Who is we though?
---
Just hope that it's a daytime uprising so all that Nocturnal kit you've turned it will be of no use to them.
---
nice! I try everytime I see a pie dispenser (in both FO4 and 76) alas, I have never ever score the perfectly preserved Pie
---
I was the fifth. I never bother unless it‚Äôs like 3/4
---
That's good tbh, more fire under the pot to fix it faster. Can't wait to see all the tears crying about how people's stalker's fire rate LMG is worthless now because big bad evil bethesda removed their fun
---
I admit I‚Äôve only done that event once. 
---
But I‚Äôve always been put back with my team on the same server. I‚Äôm sorry for your troubles there.
---
Yep, HUGE buzz kill. That's the nature of the beast I suppose.
---
There are still possibilities other then increasing the max item level. Maybe a way to refine gear to increase the stats or something like that (they could add a murmgh quest line were we unlock this kind of feature) . But level 50 is supposed to be the point we're you're leveling only for perks.
---
I would be okay with this. Simple snow machine at my camp that makes it look like its snowing but doesn't stick on the ground. Just for visuals of winter/xmas time
---
Just checked again in game: the base damage of the Gauss Shotgun without the Prime Receiver is 231. With Prime, it's 288. No perks, No bloody mess, full health. It was the same on PTS.
---
Base Gauss Shotgun + Full Demo = 307 (I don't know why it's so effective for this thing)
---
Prime Gauss + Full Demo = 383.
---
On Live, 3/3/3 Shotgunner, Bloody Mess, Full Demo, Junkie's Prime Gauss = 1085 
---
On PTS, it was...close to 802? PTS is offline until the next iteration, so I can't go back and check.
---
Yes. I get anywhere from 350-400 with stealth commando and I can solo it. Although it‚Äôs a lot harder since they took the ability to cripple away. Thank god that‚Äôs coming back tomorrow.
---
Sorry to say it, but you're objectively wrong on that one, friend
---
If they already know why was almost nothing done? People should post about issues here and not just try to circlejerk this game to greatness, you‚Äôre just lying to yourself.
---
Just fixing the calculation isn't too hard. They made it work on Survival mode back then.
---
Truly can‚Äôt wait for this. I thought it was nuts when season 1 dropped and so many ppl did the events in the forest now forest is going to be hopping being we have higher enemies now. Can‚Äôt wait man
---
How do people still not get this?
---
Making things grindy and inconvenient is intentional. They control the ecosystem and they want your money.
---
Reading this sub is like listening to a friend in an abusive relationship justifying their partner's actions.
---
agree.
---
I‚Äôve always read and that you need Wasteland Whisperer level 1.  All the taming videos indicate this as well.  It‚Äôs also what I needed to use to tame my Mirelurk Hunter.  Please provide some context to where you got this information.
---
Sadly, that's not a 100% guarantee to prevent it.
---
Fair enough. From AT‚Äôs video it looked like PA was working pretty well throughout.
---
Yes snow please!!!
---
Members... Our view of the outside world is once again... sullied.
---
You can build a terminal for that
---
Oh I'm sure people will keep posting here about it. It's a complete waste of time, though. Accomplishes nothing. Would be smarter to post about it on social media or the actual Bethesda forums.
---
Also, had you bothered to actually read my post, you would have noticed that I mention Bethesda is aware of the problem and has done nothing about it.
---
So I have that and am bloodied and I have had well fed but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever died when it went away. But I could‚Äôve just not known about it.
---
Edit: never mind I see In another comment that being I have healing factor that it helps me
---
I agree. Hyperinflation would definitely be a problem. It should stay. Maybe 50,000 would be slightly better.
---
Markets can correct themselves. WoW does hard cap at an astronomical amount (10 million gold I believe) and this issue does not exist. Will inflation occur? Yes. Will the market eventually even out? More than likely. However, this is just my opinion.
---
Id honestly say raise it to 50k and see what happens before making any bigger decisions.
---
Yep all of you are in a daily ops team people can join you. No idea if that is also the case for other teams.
---
I bought them for 100 caps at vendor
---
Thanks. It's frustrating because boss fights are the only thing I do anymore, and I haven't seen many nuke launches.
---
Man, this guy comes by to roast my ass at least 3 times a week.
---
Use your perfectly perked bloodied build, equip a BE gun, test it, equip the exact same TSE gun, test it and see the difference.
---
Its not that bloodied is total shit, because both TSE bullets have to hit and thats not always the case but it's clearly stronger if they do.
---
I‚Äôve heard these are notoriously rare due to RNG. I‚Äôll be on the lookout of course.
---
The possibilities are nice and flexible based on unique builds.
---
A lot of people out there have been playing this game for a long time, and have more max lvl gear than they know what to do with. I wouldn't mind having to work for some newer weapons and armor, it would give me something to do.
---
i understood OP, but if you want to be tight about it...thats one long sentence.
---
That's nit as awesome as winning.
---
I have not seen anything posted by bethesda either way. So i would suspect it launches on consoles at the same time.
---
Yeah, it's pretty impressive. I'll probably have it at maxed out eventually.
---
All I want for Christmas is you!
---
You can only earn a plan once per day then right? Or I heard there was some kind of limit at least anyway
---
Any other junk items? I‚Äôm really interested in collecting them. I recently found a few items I‚Äôve never seen before including the gold glass cup, vault tec alarm clock, and vtu coffee cup.
---
I'm not sure, but I don't think so.
---
I believe there has been a nuke bug in recent days. But I‚Äôve not seen evidence of that myself as I‚Äôve been in nuke zones almost every day.
---
Yes but usually when grievances get aired out in public, companies tend to resolve them quicker.
---
Always ends on a Monday at the daily reset.
---
Correct, once a day / rank for those plans. Once you achieve Elder rank you will not get another chance at the plans until next day.
---
Awesome thank you. I don‚Äôt have the gauss shotgun so I only have temp values in here. I knew the ones I had seen felt very low. I will update accoedingly
---
There's more than just the Legendary SPECIALS... I don't know what you are saying. But it definitely doesn't make bloodied/unyielding useless.
---
Ts now adds 25% of the weapons base damage. That is then split between the two bullets. Each dealing 62.5% of your weapons damage
---
High end will become caps-relevant again so it‚Äôs not all a bad thing. Instead of ‚Äòtrade only‚Äô, you can see a real caps price tag. It won‚Äôt be like real world inflation Zimbabwe style, because stuff are still being dropped and looted for free. You‚Äôll get laughed at and camp probably explobaited if you attempt to sell stimpaks at 200 caps each.
---
It now does 25% instead of 100%
---
That must be why the issue got resolved after all the posts here about it. Good thinking.
---
Even though you were wrong about the wendigos, you‚Äôre still right about glow sight.
---
Sure. To each their own.
---
Each bullet does 62.5% damage. If they both hit its 125%. It‚Äôs not double damage.
---
Gave you a shoutout in the file :)
---
Yep, only thing i am looking forward to is saving my monthly FO1st. 
---
Will logon tomorrow one last time and uninstall
---
Are magic weapons fixed in Patch 22?
---
Also, please make the vendor resets have a timer for each character. I hate heading to a vendor legendary or not and they're not ready for my business. Imagine if that happened in real life... Sorry no money yet, come back later....
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and I‚Äôve only ever seen one person set their price for serums above 500c
---
Aw, you didn't need to do that :D Just happy to help.
---
Click the link, I didn't provide the photo. It's auto generated from the link.
---
Ah okay good to know. I will update accordingly. Not sure if I was thinking FO4 or just totally messed up on this. Either way thank you. This is the kind of feedback I‚Äôm looking for!
---
One quick note though, I thought that it caps at +80%, someone feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
Are the items on a checklist to avoid duplicates hopefully?
---
Thank you for sharing this, I hope they fix it.
---
I have no info on that.
---
Thanks!
---
I already fought all of them at this places but the behemoth at the toxic valley.
---
The thing is what about those of us that didn't know that and opened all the packs even in the lvl 300s. If they can't find a way to reimburse those, that's alot of perk coins missing
---
Np :) I even went and double checked within game so i'm not talking out of my ass.
---
All the levels work while taking rads, but the difference between 1 and 6 in most circumstances is negligible for the cost IMO.
---
Hey I‚Äôm sorry. Won‚Äôt happen again.
---
There was one, but it got fixed. There was a way around it by checking with the bunker first.
---
Personally, I don't mind.  It's an indicator of a common problem and/or frustration.  Others post possible work arounds that could help some.
---
Anybody know if nukes and dragons or someone has a beta or planning system yet?
---
Guess we‚Äôll wait and see. Thanks for the info though
---
They do read feedback here, that‚Äôs why Bethesda‚Äôs community managers sometimes post here. Volume helps boost visibility/awareness.
---
when the game launched, two shot added a secondary projectile that did the same damage as the weapon 
---
making it effectively do double damage with the drawback of faster weapon degradation and penalties to your accuracy
---
this was just overpowered, as the drawbacks werent significantly enough compared to other legendary effects that needed you to be at low health, or running around with no armor rating
---
(as explosive at that time also did 100% damage the combination of TSE was outright hilarious)
---
bethesda nerfed the TS effect to only add 25% extra damage
---
meaning, you shoot two bullets with a combined damage of 125% that of the base damage, evenly spread between two bullets
---
the penalties didnt change, but due to these two bullets with less damage than base damage their was a third drawback added... armor penetration
---
as a general rule, the higher your damage per shot, the better your armor penetration, meaning that even though the weapon states it does 125% damage, in all actuallity thats not what you see when using it.
---
therefore, the TS effect isnt all that usefull anymore.
---
Some people still like it and on certain weapons, like heavies that are allready used in close ranges and have a perk boosting ther armor penetration
---
the effect can still perform well
---
atm the combination of TSE for some reason seems to perform very well with the new damage model that comes with tomorrows patch, 
---
but its not clear if thats due to a bug or if its intended
---
in the regular game or on the PTS?  The Queen at Grafton Dam during the Swarm of Suitors event has never spawned for me although the entire event talks about the mirelurks coming to mate and to beware of the Mirelurk Queen lol
---
It's not nocturnal, so not trash.
---
Other than the VATS issue with lever actions, it's a decent rifle.
---
Looks like a good weapon to do VATS crits.
---
Is super duper only doubling the base amount intended?
---
In other words Bethesda made it suck on purpose.
---
As I say, I know it's not a bloodied explosive weapon or one of the other legendaries that people get mega-excited for. But it's a gun I think I'll get some good use out of: it'll help keep me alive while I build up the crit meter and then crit for extra damage.
---
Appreciate it. I‚Äôve made the proper change. I don‚Äôt play bloodied so thank you for doing that!
---
I grabbed a mod from nexusmods that overwrites the classical station with more 50s-70s music. I never listen to classical and didn't want to get rid of Appalachia radio.
---
I also prefer this method over playing YouTube or Spotify because it also has custom made commercials, and turns off/quiets down when in game stuff happens, like events, pipboy alerts or holotapes.
---
Jingle bugs, jingle bugs, lagging all the waaaay
---
No but seriously - i‚Äòd love to see that.
---
The majority of people here who buy everything bethesda says.
---
PVP isnt completely broken. It does need a little bit of attention though. This patch should help close the gap for non meta players.There have always been shitty impatient people in the wasteland. Even if they remove PVP griefers will still find a way to grief.
---
Will be a while before I can play since my character is carrying so many legendaries from the event.
---
My camp will be under siege with higher lvl creatures....they should buff turrets.
---
NukesDragon has it already implemented into the Build Planner.
---
It‚Äôs advertised as buy one get one free but 2-shot is really 1.25 shot in Bethesda‚Äôs nerfed world.
---
Not so quick Lance Armstrong!
---
But they consider those two entirely different effects then in this case, the legendary perk doesn't increase your base stat by X thus increasing perk slots by X, it's increasing the stat by x and seperately increasing slots by x.
---
Yep! Waiting on tomorrow's patch! It can't come soon enough!!
---
Really looking forward to the legendary perks and re-exploring the Wasteland with new enemy levels!
---
I do this in the overseer's house because it's instanced, and I don;t have to worry about random people walking by grabbing stuff before I can pick it up.
---
they posted it on Facebook, that it is tomorrow
---
Stuck here too
---
Thank you for the warning. That was my first target to spend into so that I can share max Adrenaline. Guess max tenderizer it is... for now.
---
If you allow the spawn to reach island they spawn her but I haven‚Äôt saw that since I played during launch
---
Well, lol, guess I got the plans on a lucky drop a while back.
---
Well in this instance its not resolved.  But you have to look at why it isn't.  Most likely is that its a difficult bug to fix.  Either way they need to sort it out.  They will ultimately lose players over it.  
---
Your defensive attitude when players post valid complaints is outstanding.  They have every right to make a post on here.  This game isn't a free handout, its a paid product.  I admire your dedication beefy but fixing these things helps the community and growth of the game.  I mean, don't we all want it to succeed and continue for many years?
---
I mean... isn't this how it's always supposed to work?  It's still just a perk and like any other perks, chems or legendary effects it's adding the points on top of your base Charisma not increasing your base charisma.  Shared perks are supposed to go off of your base value otherwise every bloodied build would be sharing the max perks.
---
Go for a stealth commando since even with nerf it'll still be the dps king
---
I had this happen on Xbox awhile back. Everytime I would go to fight the queen as soon as I would load in down there it would disconnect me. By time I could get back in she would be dead or that stupid bug where it would act like my character was level one and I couldn‚Äôt use any weapons but a syringer. Ugh
---
I fear no mutants, I fear the Gutsy's with AA pistols.
---
That is a good idea
---
Should be fixed now!
---
Ahh, okay. That might explain it. Thank you!
---
If he left your lootbag he likely wasn't a griefer. He was just looking for PVP in the only place it can be found these days.
---
In that case I feel like the max level still might be useful for those trying to push a SS (+ radshield) build that can survive in nuke zones without the need for PA or stealth armor
---
Good look on that Legendary Endurance note... I came here to ask that question.
---
Nah, these are bugged, they take you out in about 2 seconds max, you can't even outheal them with Quantums, its mad :-)
---
Looking at the laundry list of CAMP items I‚Äôm eagerly awaiting all of this probably huge download.
---
Where's the roleplay?
---
Really? Why is that? The uninstall reinstall that is?
---
I don't know about "the music from West Virginia lumber."
---
I think the Nukeshine bar has a unique one (maybe the same).
---
Shit happens
---
Does anyone know what time it drops? will it be at Atom shop reset time, which is 5PM here or will it be earlier due to maintenance etc?
---
Nice one. Yeah I‚Äôve had that event complete for me before. It‚Äôs nice. But this morning I didn‚Äôt have time to grind some of the ones to get one last roll of 50 so I went to purveyor with 38 and just rolled a two star and got a bloodied faster fire rate gat plasma. Not bad
---
My point is not that people shouldn't be posting about complaints, or that losing SCORE points isn't a valid complaint. Anyone thinking that missed my point by a wide margin.
---
Hey man still need a private server? I am getting on so if you do just lmk.
---
The server actually hitches on certain rolls based on the seed. So yeah, it's like each table has its own payouts
---
Ya, I'm really hoping they start looking at buffing weapons, legendary effets, and useless perk cards.
---
The insult bot always finds me at the low points in the game.  It‚Äôs like they know
---
Thats great I have terrible luck so don't mind buying from camps
---
It heavily depends on which mutations, enemies, and location you are in combined with your build.
---
The Burrows has huge distances to cover, it would be hard. Valley Galleria is relatively easy, as is V94 once you learn the layout (jetpack/marsupial/bird bones help a lot on this one).
---
I‚Äôve solo‚Äôd a few to Elder in my Bloodied HW/PA main; it‚Äôs usually close, just under the limit, and I‚Äôve missed a few too, but I was still learning. With optimization it gets easier.
---
The biggest thing is not leaving the zone to hunt enemies. You need that 1x bonus active 100% of the time
---
But we don't know what work arounds work and which ones don't. For every example of one that "works," there is an example of it not working.
---
When I use it, the grenades home on the target and the second one hits right after the first. It forces the hit on moving targets based on your chance to hit when you fire.
---
You must have like 1 PER
---
So... like assaultrons then?
---
There‚Äôs no security checks for MS games stores games. The reason people think this is Windows hides game installs behind a system owned folder that users don‚Äôt have access to without some major modifications to permissions. Every game that I‚Äôve ever messed with can be ‚Äúhacked‚Äù via things like cheat engine, the most basic of bitch hacking that can be done.
---
You want to be a professional vendor sir? Well all you have to do is follow this guide to having your coffers constantly full of caps! 
---
Make sure your camp is in an easily noticeable area, ideally Whitesprings or near somewhere there‚Äôs a quest. I have mine in between Pleasant Valley Train Station and Site Alpha.
---
Have a nice camp with all the essentials - a stash box, if you have one a scrapbox, the workbenches, a bed and something musical. You‚Äôre more likely to have a paying customer if they‚Äôre able to resupply, repair their armor and snag their XP buffs for well rested and well tuned. A nice looking camp also attracts more people and catches their eye.
---
While having a nicely decorated and furnished camp is important, it is also equally if not more important to have your vendors in an easily reached and seen location. Hiding them will just piss people off and make them give up and shop elsewhere.
---
Don‚Äôt sell any legendaries you wouldn‚Äôt use yourself if you played that build - example, don‚Äôt try and sell a one star vampire‚Äôs black powder pistol, *unless* you want to be a scrip vendor. When you‚Äôre selling scrip, people will generally pay 15-25 caps per scrip. So a 1 star is worth 5 scrip, which is 100 caps. A 2 star is worth 15 scrip, making it 300. And a 3* is 40, so it‚Äôll sell for 1000 to the right buyers.
---
Aid items. That can be tricky, because some people will empty your entire stock if they catch you with it in there assuming it‚Äôs reasonably priced. I won‚Äôt pay more than 20 caps for Psychotats for example. Stealth Boys will generally sell at 50, and MkIII stealth boys often sell for twice that. Don‚Äôt try and sell water. Serums generally sell well for 200-300 each. 
---
Junk. You can sell junk if you wish, but it‚Äôll make some players wary of visiting your camp because trap camps will sell you cheap junk then kill you so the camp owner can steal it back. Rare junk sells very quickly when priced appropriately (3-6 caps each.)
---
Ammo. Unless it is Ultracite ammo or cores, it all sells for 1 cap each. *No exceptions.* I have nuked camps for overpriced ammo before. Don‚Äôt make me do it again. U ammo can sell for 2-3 caps each, plasma cores for 50 caps or so and fusion cores at 1c per % charge. I personally only stock fully charged cores at 75 caps each, large amounts of 5.56 one cap each and the occasional round I find out and about. Ammo that sells best - .308, .45, 5.56, 5mm, .50 cal, fusion cells, gamma rounds and plasma cartridges. All at one cap each.
---
It‚Äôs ok to play a little joke, I have a dirty pillow in my vending machine for 69 caps. Someone bought it yesterday so I had to replace it. Others have certain notes for exorbitant prices.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I will buy any gamma rounds you happen to get a hold of...
---
Hey dude yeah that would be handy. Im just about to head out ill be back on in 2 hours or so.will you still be on then?
---
Yep, that's my build. But speaking of dps, I see people that MELT the Queen or Earl with heavy guns. I might be doing something wrong, I deal a lot of damage but not that insane amount!
---
Swapping weapons is slower than just gun bashing. Don‚Äôt even bother with a melee weapon unless that‚Äôs your build
---
The equilibrium you refer to is a great point to start untangling this. I agree that it has been reached in Player Vendors for consumables (aid, ammo, junk) - by their very nature, they're perfectly suited to be put into passive-sale tool that Player Vendor is.  
---
This equilibrium is actually nowhere in sight for legendary items in Player Vendor context, that are few orders of magnitude more complex than consumables. People need smelting juice everywhere, but i.e. the armor selection depends entirely on local context, and very same items will have extremely different prices depending where you sell them. All the data gathered as part of browsing vendors and VPN travelling the world to learn those nuances paint a very clear picture. A picture which says just that: the only resemblances of equilibrium for legendary items is existing only in global markets faciliating 3rd party tools such as reddit/discords/facebook groups. I could literally randomize the output between 500 and 25000 caps and provide values consistent with Player Vendor prices, so damn inconsistent they are. The whole art of Vendoring is for many players to jump around looking for a underpriced items. It's chaos. The only equilibrium legendary items are having is in the global markets, and in the active sales.  
---
This is why the data that gives literally zero value in terms of measuring if the sales for given prices are successfull we consider inferior to datapoints where multiple people compete over an item. The latter can be used to gauge demand, the first simply can't, it only speaks of expectations/access to information, not of the prices themselves. The global markets forms patterns, the vendors are pure lottery. I've spend hundreds of hours analyzing this data before deeming it worthless.   
---
Without a global auction house, without possibility of querying the Bethesda databases, it would require literal army of workers to monitor what is 'a series of exceptions' anyway to achieve half of the precision that the tool has for global markets, and each division of this army would only monitor some fraction of the world - there'd have to be different prices for different regions of the world.  
---
If they published a global auction house, we'd probably rework the tool into something else, because it wouldn't be needed in such form afterwards. That is fine with us, because that would mean the pains we tried to help with are solved. Our focus with the tool lately has been it's textual side anyway - sharing the information about what goes together well. Bringing the context closer to new players. Helping them grow beyond the need for such tool.  
---
It's a community-focused project aimed to help new players get paid fairly and to reduce the amount of scrip-legendary-pricecheck-requests experienced players were flooded with. Your expectation is to turn it into a corporation. Your expectation is that we add few hundred man-hours of work daily to what we already put into it, only to get shittier results. It's not a reasonable request. It's "this is important for me so I will ignore rest of what builds the context" type of request.
---
Wtf what liar says there is no hoarding element to Fallout?  There was hoarding in the SP games even.
---
My first four times all failed due to crashes or disconnect. The third was especially disheartening: I‚Äôd finished, got tons of screws, looted Earle, ran up and looted the red trunk at the entrance, headed outside, and‚Ä¶ the loading screen just stayed black forever until I killed the game. When I loaded back in, I had no loot, not even the screws from the wendigo spawns. I was basically ready to quit fallout entirely in disgust. I didn‚Äôt play for three days after that. PS4 Pro.
---
Since my soul-crushing first four runs, my ratio has been much better. I‚Äôve done it like 30 times with only maybe 2 more crashes.
---
Ehhhh....
---
Melee is brutal in some zones with some mutations. Valley Galleria with Robots with Freezing touch was fucking hell, I switched to shotguns.
---
VATS builds will have fits with Camoflague; better learn to ADS, and swap your VATS perks out for other survival/direct damage ones.
---
What are you talking about? Gear level cap should be limited to 30 and below. Combat is still a joke after all those nerfs
---
oh sorry brother, I never fought a grafton monster in the ash heap. my mistake
---
but everything else is in the game now.
---
the colossos in the bog may spawn in  grove near fissure site prime when doing scorched earth; there is random encounter between appallachian antiques and watoga that may spawn a sheepsquatch, every now and them I like to lure it into watoga for the lols...
---
Uh, if you did the quest you know where is an elevator you can enter on the first floor, right? That takes you directly to the benches?
---
I mean they have extra checks to validate a patch. Just like psn.  A PC patch is way faster to approve than xbox or psn. They have some extra checks or some kind and that's why wasteland 3 was delayed for their patches  compared to steam
---
Wha? You don‚Äôt touch them ever
---
Or just take the elevator on the first floor there.
---
That's the magic effect used with lmgs, gatling lasers, and both miniguns
---
They are in the next patch
---
No more using cheap weapons to farm pipe guns to scrape for steel and ammo
---
You could run it with nothing if you wanted to haha, it‚Äôll be good with anything on it! Glad you like it.
---
Are they coming tomorrow? Or patch 23?
---
Given they brought over Captain Cosmos assets from Creation Club, I'm hopeful the creation club arcade items &amp; Slocum Joes items will eventually port over.
---
"It' a legendary super sale until September 14"
---
And from that you got tomorrow?
---
The 33% VATS hit chance makes the weapon glitch and do ridiculous damage in VATS
---
I could see how it could be fun, but those numbers def wouldn‚Äôt work and the requirements would make the build useless in many zones like watoga. I‚Äôm ok with RP‚Äôing, but anytime we introduce a new prefix it dilutes the chances of me getting the gear that fits my build. If that‚Äôs going to happen, it needs to be a solid prefix that could go towards an optimized build. Not just something to flesh out a rp toon.
---
I was one of those people
---
The character that has that thing has 8 PER, maybe your 2 shot has VATS hit chance increase, I don't think mine has that.
---
Dude thanks so much. But is my camp being in the cranberry big a bad idea for vending?
---
Yup, I‚Äôll send you a pm with my psn so you can add me when you get on.
---
Then I would only log on once a week.
---
Yeah, Christmas Eve when you already know your presents. You're getting a new PS5 (Daily Ops), a few more comfortable shirts, but different colors than you had (Legendary Perks), GTA V for the 3rd time (crippling the SBQ again), and a bag of rotten, moldy fruit (damage nerf).
---
if you mean the friendly fire perk mine works with the flame on players..... not sure about other things 
---
but I mostly use stimpaks to heal I use the flamer mostly to clear hordes of enemies and debuff them
---
Tato Salad has killed me a couple times....damn Grahm poisoning us...
---
As mentioned, when the well fed bonus goes away, it drops my health almost all the way down. I like the food buffs, so I just try to be aware of when they will run out. Pop in a stim right away. Can be a little tedious though
---
I would like jason, or freddy, or mike, maybe even have an outfit of macready from the thing
---
Can you you use throwing weapons like knives and tomahawks?
---
No, because I did the quest once and left and never went back so why would it occur to me that the quest unlocked a new way to get in? 
---
But, thanks for telling me, I guess.
---
To pretend you are Robin prince of thieves with a grenade launcher.
---
How many perks can we have at once?
---
Maybe. But i really don't know
---
Friendly fire only works on the shishkebab or gun bashing with the flamer, it heals any friendly tagged player or npc. Nuteral players or npcs it just hurts.
---
Gauss minigun can also he magic due to the explosive effect but it has to have atleast the tri barrel.
---
Is it really nerfed? I get like 5-10 maybe more per nuke
---
I would say wait and see. Bank up some levels so you can swap stats/perks if needed.
---
But just wait till it drops and see how things settle after the chaos subsides.
---
That a good lesson in bad UX design. I didn‚Äôt interpret it as ‚Äúyou need to walk into the mine‚Äù because I‚Äôd already seen videos from PTS, but I can totally see how someone might think that, expend a lot of effort, and not understand why it was wasted by unclear instructions. Bethesda should improve that. Even just clearer wording would help, or auto-joining the event if you walk into the mine mouth, which I agree should actually be open.
---
I feel like a significant portion of the player base is suffering from some weird kind of Stockholm syndrome. Bethesda fucks us over at every opportunity, yet you people keep cheering and being excited.
---
You know this shit is going to be beyond broken, right?
---
Players choosing to seek out these glitched pixels do so on their own accord. I bear no responsibility on others' actions. For instance, if I make a post about, say, bungee jumping, yes, I am *informing* the readers about the activities, but unless I am encouraging them actively to seek out Bungee jumping, I can guarantee that the post will have a minimal impact on the person's lives. The bug that deals in the creation of these guns, as pointed out be u/Papa_Shekels, has long been patched out. I only know 3 reputable sources of these weapons on XB1. This alone should prove that these guns are hard to come by. Even making a post about double-sided walls or legacies, by your logic, should be removed as they deal with bugs. (However, double interior walls are something I think we can all agree on being much needed in CAMP Building.) I can see where you're coming from, metaphorically speaking, but I don't really agree.
---
Oh good, now it can be killed in 5 seconds instead of 10.
---
Bloodied is still the hardest hitting. That won‚Äôt be changing with the nerf tomorrow. You may want to wait a few days and see how you like your junkie after the nerf. I‚Äôve been on the PTS and am bloodied, I‚Äôve had no problems doing everything I used to.
---
There will be a full list of changes available about this time tomorrow.
---
Am I the only one who doesn't even bother to spend any of that currency? I know it's free stuff, but the odds of getting something useful are so low. If there's a specific item that I want, it's much easier to just find a trader.
---
Why did this get removed by the mods?
---
I am with you. I had an overall better haul of legendary gear from a solo run of Monster Mash on Saturday than I did from all the scrip I spent over the weekend the purveyors.
---
I wonder if killing them makes it less likely they show up because I shoot them like every time and I haven't seen them around in weeks.
---
As someone who just did the grind to level 50+ on a new account, I would have killed to have level appropriate drops from enemies.  For me, that'll be the real key here... do we see more contextual  drops like ammo that matches the gun we're using.  If so, this should be an acceptable change grinding up.   If I still only get rare drops of 5.56 then this will be miserable.
---
At the very least, make it a certain number of shots fired for explosive weapons and not enemies hit. Far mans shouldn‚Äôt break in 3 shots because I hit six enemies.
---
Santa Bethesda only deals in lumps of coal.
---
Do you mean "or the wrist" as in the Pip-Boy?  How is it impossible? If you want to RP as a non-dweller, it's easy.  "I found a dead dweller, I took his cool wrist-radio."
---
Im so happy for you my buddy! Ill keep an eye out for a food rifle for ya. I just gave away a vamps gauss rifle. Dont let the haters bring you down. I love your gun have FUN with the GUN!
---
It still opens up perk slots and improves buy/sell prices at npc vendors so it's not like EVERYONE should avoid it.
---
I tamed a mirelurk hunter without wasteland whisperer. The videos are old and have outdated and incorrect information. They should really be taken down.
---
What happened to nuclear proliferation? They said they were pulling it for bug fixes, but it‚Äôs never been heard from again.
---
God yes, the nerf is going to hit some bloodied builds the hardest but it will still be the meta purely because of the stat boosts from unyielding, all the perks aimed at low health builds and the mutations. The damage from weapons is only a small part of a bloodied build.
---
 It is worth noting that using anti armour weapons with a bloodied build is still going to give you more damage then playing with it at full health.
---
Team bonuses? Or a new perk like radicool.
---
Like like like like yeah /r/titlegore
---
No, much worse, I can tank 4 or 5 from Assaultron easily, these literally 1 or 2 and you're down. AT showed it on his last stream, about 4hr 50 min point if you wanna see yourself.
---
Same here!
---
So how does the Gauss mini gun become magic I have a junkies FFR with tri barel on that only makes it to 135 if I remimber. Would it be if you had on the armor piece with 15% block? serious question cuz I‚Äôm trying to figure out if the damage I was doing was magic or pre magic
---
A power armor skin that looks like a cardboard box robot costume would be excellent.
---
AA explosive is gonna be the new meta. 
---
Also TSE is back, Baby!
---
Wow downvoted by the nerf baby mob.
---
I toyed around with a shredder build at one point. It's really fun and does in fact *shred*, but the only way around durability is to slot Bear Arms and carry around as many miniguns as you can. It might take a while to find decent ones with bash damage or FFR at player vendors, but until then, craft some yourself and go buck wild, lol.
---
This is not how I would have expected it to work given that the SPECIAL legendary perks increase the slot's perk card capacity, unlike buffs which obviously do not. Also the legendary perks don't let you exceed 15 in a SPECIAL, so in nearly all respects, except the one the OP identifies, they are increases to the base SPECIAL.
---
They send the updates far in advance to accommodate these approval times. Sorry I thought you meant the nonexistent protection Windows Store Games mythos everyone talks about here.
---
Very specific builds in very specific situations. Magic users and stealth teams will be the meta
---
Kinda wish the the one wasteland came out before legendary perks. We‚Äôre going to get all these interesting cards and all they‚Äôre going to do is make us feel close to as powerful as we are rn. Feels like a hollow victory.
---
If you can get your intake down to 6, you can entirely cancel it with the final rank of the perk. Rank one lets you take almost no rads in PA and none at all in a hazmat (if it‚Äôs 1 per second like I remember).
---
I've been playing since Beta, never thought to try and interact with him.
---
Or shoot him.
---
Thank you for clarifying that. Good to hear we actually get the animation with it. It is a shame it doesn't also heal like most Auto-Docs, but at least it can clear up diseases. I'm setting up that Sympto-Matic the first second I get it and offering its services for free.
---
Pretty sure people would want to stick with their unyielding sets so they will stay below 20%. Makes no sense using anything other than bloodied if you are using an unyielding armor set
---
Are you going to stay Bloodied? I just coughed up a lot for my first good Bloodied weapon and I am terrified it will be rendered useless.
---
Yes junkies is magic, and having ffr helps alot too. You have one of the best combinations for magic damage.
---
Every single one of these, with the possible exception of Ammo Factory and the special cards, is so useless it's actually insulting.
---
I love how they always put the Fatman in the trailers.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/427911/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-september-15-2020?language%5B%5D=en
---
It's likely intended, but it is Bethesda so it's really hard to tell.
---
Why is it that community keeps coming up with solid ideas?
---
I like that. I put weapons up for reasonable prices any way but if someone wanted to offer a bit less I‚Äôd always be open to negotiation !
---
So you're saying you want more nerfs?
---
Nothing like working for weeks or even months and many many hours to finally get the right perks armor and fixer just to have it screwed up on the next patch.
---
I remember shortly after launch I could see it. Than again I haven‚Äôt done a team, except the recent ones, since then so idk when it was gone
---
Well thats fucked
---
That BoS outfit is the most non-fallouty outfit in the game, I love it. I wish the gas mask on the head piece was separate from the hood :(
---
Is the reward resetting like dailies or like vendors?
---
Is the location resetting like dailies or vendors?
---
This was mentioned in the PTS forums.  Your ability to share perks is based on real Charisma points, no modifiers of any sort.  You may want to reallocate points into Charisma from another SPECIAL and just use a legendary perks to make up the SPECIAL points you moved.  That is what I'm doing for Strength to minimize the upcoming Nerf somewhat.  I'm moving 3 points into Strength from 3 other SPECIALS 1 each.  So my Strength is max at 15 (REAL value before other modifiers) and then taking 3 Legendary perk cards (Perception/Agility/Endurance) at base (0) coins to make up for me moving those points.  I'll add coins to each at a later date.
---
I'm a cash-machine dumper. Thought it might come in useful to some lucky rando.
---
IF I recall from an earlier video, the difference didn't help enough, again for the cost. The good and the bad is you can do anything you want, the bad is you can't unrank to get coins back.
---
"That sounds fun, but not fun for *me*, so no."
---
I say we eat this one first.
---
To those saying it would be impossible, it could just take the Nuclear Winter "ash" effect, lighten the color, apply it to the tops of structures, still make the ground have the overlaid ash/snow texture, make copy of the "rain" weather and replace the rain texture, adjust the fall rate, and boom.
---
Currently scheduled for tomorrow. Patch 22.
---
Me too, BE90 Handmade switched my sneak commando to bloodied and had a shit ton of fun. It was the first time I‚Äôve used it in anger for about 18 months)
---
I‚Äôve not got any unyielding Armour and she wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to min maxed. I did some runs of the burrows so I‚Äôll add my legendary perks tomorrow and run it again to see if there is any difference.
---
(Did the same with all my character so I‚Äôll get a feel for what works and what doesn‚Äôt )
---
It just works.
---
I think we have enough problems here in the wasteland without encouraging cannibalism.
---
Well... perhaps we can politely ask Atlas.
---
I won‚Äôt say more, because spoilers if you hadn‚Äôt read the atlas terminals before the place locked down.
---
I‚Äôm planning on leaning harder into it. I‚Äôm gonna use legendary perks to make a bloodied heavy gunner I can switch into. I‚Äôve been holding my own on the PTS still. I‚Äôve been soloing the daily ops, so I think I‚Äôll be fine. Worst case scenario I‚Äôll pick up some more damage resistance perks if I need to.
---
Radshield stacks. You can easily take a bunch of radshield and get 3k rad resistance. Still not as good as a hazmat suit cause it has a hidden resistance but  you can easily survive in a nuke zone with a radaway  here and there.
---
This will be fixed with Patch 22 tomorrow. Sorry for the wait on this one!
---
How we gonna balance this game without nerfs? Everything has to be nerfed big time. There's no other way
---
I wish there was a mole miner outfit :(
---
Ah that's fair then. I just want my patch tomorrow. Tired of randomly exploring and finding a mob 40 levels higher than me that lays down the pain all over my face. Now it will.be am even world. And the new daily ops sound amazing. So much goodness to be had! At least until baldurs gate 3
---
Cannibalism could solve some problems if those problems were people
---
You start earning slots at Level 50, The max slots are 6. You can have all 6 maxed if you want but that takes a lot of perk cards to achieve that. 150 perk cards to get 300 coins which is what's required for max rank. So 900 perk cards you don't want. yikes!
---
She always spawns if you let one of the mirelurks mske it to the island. You cn actually end that event faster by just waiting for her to spawn.
---
Did you try crafting at the power armor station?
---
Bethesda is gonna bethesda I guess. ;)
---
This. I‚Äôve seen many people have PA crafting issues and had forgotten to put down a frame.
---
Watch this from 4hr 50, both through emergency protocols and full health afterwards, they nasty :-)
---
These aliens only used it for laser tag
---
get a power armor chassis and use the power armor workstation
---
quirks of ps4 dl upd8s.  every program needs like its size + 50% or soemthing like that.  admittedly my hd is pretty crowded (ill never del PT demo!! lol)
---
I think a lot of players will find them useful, there's room for more for sure!
---
Strangler is power armour man
---
Well, I'll be damnvoted. Thanks!
---
Maybe you were thinking about thorn and bought strangler.
---
Strangler heart is power armor, not regular armor. Can only be crafted at a power armor station
---
After all this time...nice.
---
I just wish the mods would treat those posts as spam and remove them.
---
Did they say something about adding more legendary perks in the Future?
---
Maxed Ammo Factory with Maxed Ammosmith is going to give you a ton of bullets.
---
it was a compromise....they REALLY hate it in Missouri
---
&gt; I have noticed some discrepancies with the Calculator 
---
Thanks, I'll look into those.
---
Most of it is here-say.  A video from a couple months ago isn‚Äôt that old.  Mechanics haven‚Äôt changed since.  But none of the patch notes ever address taming anyway.  
---
Just like stating how far away you are able to tame an animal.  Tame won‚Äôt show up unless you‚Äôre within a certain distance.
---
Edit:  Went over one of the more recent videos on taming done by Miz Tracey.  Whisperer is required to tame a Snallygaster, and possibly a couple others.  I suppose using it otherwise was simply a placebo effect on my part.
---
I suggest finding someone to help you complete it that doesn't have the challenge done. You could kill each other until the challenge is done.
---
Ya, I got a Mutant Slayers Tenderizer FSS +1S :)
---
And It appears to work with cores too.
---
There is a sucker born every minute!  No offense, but not ever worth 5 caps.
---
I really wish they would take them down. I get tired of correcting people.
---
They could just add automatic closing doors like they had in the Fallout 4 creation club
---
Yeah, it's quite a cool little bonus when Cop A Squatter gives you some rewards for no effort. And well done on the nice roll!
---
But it did work perfectly for me all but one single time.
---
Thank you, I intend to!
---
No idea on the first question (i would assume like dailies), and the location is instanced and will reset everytime you start the ops, so you can do it back to back as many times as you like.
---
And you need vault steel man I hate how long it takes to save this stuff
---
There‚Äôs plenty of useless prefixes you‚Äôre welcome to choose from. No one wants their RNG chipped at so a fraction of the playerbase can play around. Sorry
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôll get a squad of 4 level 300+ that just kill me. They don‚Äôt even loot my corpse or try to claim the workshop. Maybe it‚Äôs for a atom challenge or somethin.
---
If you get put back in the same server, as long as one of your teammates joined the event you should be able highlight and fast travel onto your teammate and you'll be put in the instance even if the exclamation point is gone. This has worked for me a few times.
---
This I did not know
---
I encountered 1 of these mutants. He was like level 25 in the Ash Heap at that trailer park near that town+workshop in the bottom left, little shit 2-tapped me from a mile away and my 400+ energy resistance and 300 HP didn't do shit to prevent that madness. I might as well have not worn my armour considering how BS it felt, especially trying to get my junk back.
---
Ooohh....okay that's why i can't find it...lmao. Okay, I'm not so upset now, thank you. Never thought about that cause i don't really use power armor, so thats a relief.
---
After the update I'm pretty sure two shot explosive will be better than anything. So you might hang on to it and see if it works better tommorow. angry turtle testing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EeNcV7OxZU
---
I‚Äôve actually never really noticed how long it takes, but looking back wastelanders took like 6-8 hours to do its thing. I usually only get to play on the weekends so I start it up when I get up at like 5-6am and hope it‚Äôs done doing what it needs to do by the time my kid goes for a nap at noon.
---
I think OPs point is that users would be better off taking the SPECIAL perk for any other stat they are already happy with and transferring the points to Charisma. For example, I am currently 15 perception, 5 charisma. I would be better off taking the Perception +5 legendary perk and transferring the 5 base SPECIAL points into Charisma than taking a +5 Charisma perk. Both would leave me at Perception 15, Charisma 10, but in the former case I could share 3-star cards.
---
I have one with that and another with FFR. I have like 30 PER
---
Are the weapons going to be rotating and are they going to introduce more?!
---
Nuuuuu-cleee-uuur-wiiiiiinnn-teeeer
---
Yea but thats boring I want to be able to walk around without it and just have the option to open up the no pip boy on my character it is ugly
---
I came across a ts Fatman and I figured I‚Äôd roam around the wasteland. I think I get about 5-6 shots before it breaks.
---
Pick up everything you can and sell to the vendors for 1400 caps per day. I used to just run around and sell all then extra junk i didnt need until i hot some caps built up and do events. You will get better gear.
---
The music on the jukebox in there is very different, I haven't heard it anywhere else...very much 50's/60's guitar rock I believe. I'll check the music at the Nukashine bar and see if it's the same.
---
I've just never been able to find it anywhere else.
---
Tell me about it! a friend crafted me the fixer and then I finally got the ball rolling on my commando build and now BAM! its gonna be even more useless next patch then it was this patch!
---
A couple months ago means nothing when it's a video made by some view seeking person who just regurgitates old, incorrect information. I know perfectly how taming stuff works simple because it's one of my favorite parts of the game and I've tamed dozens of pets and have seen firsthand what is and isn't true.
---
can't get in huh?
---
It allows the Tormentor perk two chances to proc, very good for crippling-support builds
---
Uhhh LOL I just suggested a solution that doesn't require nerfs to function, buffing bad things and making them VIABLE is better then just throwing nerfs out there. You make your OWN players HATE you if you nerf their good weapons into the ground and it makes them NOT want to come back to the game!
---
Because the game developers don't play their own game.
---
Yeah, lots of disappointment trying to find them, but with green thumb, chemist and superduper a run can net you a dozen or more easily.
---
It's called voice chat
---
No, but they didn't initially say anything about the ones we're getting now, so if people keep pestering them... I'm certain that the amount of requests to have passive perks (ie lockpicking and hacking)  is part of what drove the idea to make Legendary Perks. So more requests and there's no reason why we can't have more Legendary perks.
---
Having a BoS collectron is like having a permanent Insult Bot at your camp lol
---
Sadly no options on Xbox. It's just that the music that the juke box at West Virginia lumber plays is quite unique...it's not on the radio stations and I can't remember hearing it anywhere else so I wasn't sure if it was something new they added. 
---
Riomaki suggested maybe the Nukashine bar so I'll see...but otherwise I hadn't heard that particular brand of music before and was thinking maybe I'd missed it in a new release. Certainly makes great background music.
---
Make sure your camp is suitable for pets. Keep your camp device away from fences, walls, foundations, and prefabs. They will also drown if near water. They get stuck and die. Contain your building so it has ample room to never get near it. Watch it‚Äôs path and move your device according to where it walks. I put my camp device as far away as I can.
---
Yeah I guess I should try that instead of hoarding it for my camp and then worry about building up my camp after I get some good loot
---
Yes it will still be top dog
---
I got access to the bunker, just trying to complete officer on deck
---
wall of text is way too late yo.. shit drops tomorrow.. likelyhood of changes at this point are slim to none
---
Nah I can, this was just a humor post when I started going thru the service entrance instead of the main vault door (to save like 15 extra seconds lol) and thought how much of a security risk it was to have a lame service door on the side when you have a giant vault in the front. Makes no sense!
---
i found the burning mine one was easier to get a fast score on then the burrows one,  but i think that was partially because the burning mine ones i did the guys were freezers, which was way easier to deal with then the stealth guys.
---
I think technically it's probably possible to do the burrows ones elder speed solo, but it'll be really tough, especially with the different mutations.
---
Fuck yes. Cripple retuuuurns?

Damn buddy those are some numbers! Gun fu and adrenaline? [I run 3gun 1 adrenal]
---
If you're on ps4 i may have a rifle to give you.
---
Clearly you didn‚Äôt read my edit.
---
So they are never allowed to add new gear? What a shitty excuse, if you don‚Äôt want to play anymore then don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt demand that the game stagnate because you don‚Äôt want to.
---
I mean how many can be active at once? Can we use all of them?
---
I actually ran into the prize bot on the weekend and he told me "sorry no more prizes"....I HAD to shoot him at that point, it would have been wrong not to.
---
SCORE gets you the daily log in numbers, now.
---
I cant wait to go through 150 level ups to pick a perk to scrap. if only there was a simple button to press that allows someone to convert banked level-ups into perk coins
---
the duped gifts from last year haven't run out yet, lol xD
---
Never said that I just want the max equipment level kept at 45/50
---
Yes, I outlined all of that in my post.
---
Use the letters and post "pm offers" above your vending machines. Or "open to offers". Something along those lines could work.
---
I like to shoot him, fashion his scrap into ammo and use it to shoot the next one. Railway spikes for the win!
---
It's like scaling a mountain wall to get to the top, then finding out that there is a tram line for tourists.
---
i went through about 2k scrip... zero bloodied and a couple garbage junkies.    i literally put 90% of the legendaries i got into the pie machine for some randoms to fine.
---
&gt;Plan: Vault 94 Jumpsuit
---
this is all I have ever wanted. since Fallout 3, it has been a habit to have at least 1 vault jump suit from every vault I have visited. but Fallout 4 had to ruin that. thankfully 76 is adding 94's jump suit
---
Yes, it would be fun and fit into the overall atmosphere of the event
---
The fact of the matter is that people will always calculate and optimize the options given. There will always be a "best" cookie cutter method that people will flock to. As best as I can see the point of this balancing is to close the gap on how far ahead this one option is over the others. This gives the other options more viability.
---
I honestly believe people are freaking out over this "nerf" mostly because people are freaking out and calling it a nerf. When in reality the data shows that what is the best now will still be the best option. Meaning it's not a nerf. In my opinion, a nerf is when one playstyle is knocked down enough that other options become the new meta.
---
Calm down, let's see how it plays once the change hits. If it really makes your playstyle unplayable and you are unwilling to change that playstyle, then feel free to propose alternative directions.
---
Ah, I'm actually on PC. But thank you for the offer, that's very kind of you.
---
A few times he gave me a locket or a watch...occasionally a G.A.S. certificate.
---
I call it the "Nuke Silo Time Saver Perk"
---
Yeah I'm seeing this is some expensive armor to make, but I'm glad i was told where i can find it. Why i didn't think of my power armor station, is beyond me. See kids, the next time your parents say "i just had a blonde moment" this is what they meant...lol (yes, i am a blonde *sad face*)
---
They do.
---
I had to take a break from earl and go back to farming the queen just for repair kits lol so yeah it‚Äôd be great if we got them as a reward more often especially with the new update. Make it to where you can buy them along with lunchboxes or something.
---
He once found me in my camp...at the top of a mountain...not sure how he managed that one.
---
i personally saved up so i had 1000 for day one. then 150 earned each day of the sale from scrapping legendaries, and did all the daily quests i could do every day.
---
Yes, you can use as many slots that are available to you that you wish. You can only use one legendary perk per slot, and that perk can be level to 4 Stars for a max rank. There's 6 max slots, so 6 max legendary perks. It also costs a coin to remove a card from a slot.
---
I finished ACP Saturday night and got disconnected as soon as I spawned back out of the mine thus getting none of the event completion rewards. I feel your frustration completely. Yeah it‚Äôs just a video game blah blah blah but losing the resources and effort you put in for absolutely no yield is disheartening.
---
He takes a shot in the head before a starts to talk. And i still magically have the note in my inv
---
Don't forget super duper so you can end up with 2 chest pieces on the same frame.
---
Have not actually tested to see if having 2 armor pieces would have any benefit/detriments.
---
Gun fu, adrenaline, mr sandman ( only works at night ), food and chem buffs.
---
But don't forget to add Kreutzfeld-Jakob .)
---
Also, stick with one weapon and mod the hell out of it.  Most of the beginning weapons are relevant well into level 30+ if properly modded.  Don't be all 'ooo shiny' when you get a drop.   
---
 Choose your perks accordingly to maximize what you have now.
---
I didn't until now. I've never encountered a snallygaster but it will be interesting to see if wasteland whisperer is required if I ever do. I mean it should be required for a mirelurk but wasn't when I tamed mine. It would be nice knowing I didn't waste 3 points on that perk!
---
I think he died cuz he still ain‚Äôt here. I‚Äôve gone back to same spot I saw him but he hasn‚Äôt been there. I‚Äôve served hopped but nothing. I wanna tame a deathclaw but can‚Äôt find a normal one
---
or provide a stickied thread to consolidate them all
---
Lookout towers, when you climb to the top, theres a section of the railing you can interact with to survey the area. You can only do it once per tower, but it reveals locations on the map nearby. I didn't figure that out till way later.
---
A water farm for your camp is a way to make some caps with minimal effort. Place a bunch of Small water purifiers (and power them), then several times an hour you can collect purified water to sell. Not a ton of money, but its almost free.
---
Plan out your build somewhat, you can do this on https://nukesdragons.com/
---
Weapons, armor, backpacks have better versions every 10 levels. Some are 5/15/2535/45,Others are 10/20/30/40/50. Craft the higher level version when you can.
---
Go for the small backpack as soon as you can, https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Small_backpack and upgrade it when you level up. More carry weight = more loot = more money. There is a better backpack you can get from other quests too.
---
Grilled radstag meat or brahmin steaks (ribeye) temporarily adds +20 carry weight when cooked and eaten.
---
Posters in train stations can be interacted with to find quests too.
---
Bah humbug
---
From what I've read, the ally timer is different from I believe every other timer in game. The timer is 24 hours AFTER you complete the last mission. Nearly everything else is 18-24 hours after first contact(or start of missions).
---
If that's indeed a joke by one of the devs, then it's disrespectful and a way to show they don't give a fuck about it.
---
I‚Äôd be interested
---
Oh damn, i'm PC. Huzzah for all the divisions of the Enclave, though!
---
please and thankyou
---
TSE with demo expert looks like the way to go
---
im sorry i was pretty hangry in my last post.  i ate my raddish, now here are my logical arguments:
---
\-this bug, in particular, is tied into the games as a service model and its seasonal rewards.  overlooking deficiencies in this regard is clearly a failure of service and warrants constant criticism until corrected.  this is especially egregious as they removed atoms in favor of this system &amp; whats more, the seasonal rewards that user may, or may not, have sufficient score for will become available for purchase.
---
\-Raising Awareness.  not all users frequent the sub every day, so continuous and informative posts in this regard fulfill one of the major functions of an internet site such as Reddit.  information sharing such as "dont be online at midday, eastern time" is a palliative offered by fan information sharing that is only available on sites like reddit.  to stymie such collaborative efforts would be inappropriate.
---
\-im having difficulty establishing the line for what are "acceptable" and "unacceptable" technical errors that allow for developer triage.  ideally, they would have enough resources not to have to triage, but that does not seem to be the case here.  a gun may have a bad animation is fundamentally different from entire quest sections becoming unavailable.  i would argue that something as ostensibly integral to the experience as the seasons does directly impact gameplay experience and should therefore be given extremely urgent priority, especially given its microtransactionary dimension.  Unless they want to fix a light bulb in a high school bathroom instead -- that's cool too, i guess.
---
\-we shall see, in the coming weeks, what new manner of abominations and errors the new systems will wreak.  there may come a day when we look fondly upon "merely" being cheated out of SCORE points.  if they have let an error such as that languish for several weeks/months, then i am not optimistic for the future
---
I still have like 400 but I try not to use them I feel kinda bad cuz I‚Äôm 95% sure the guy who gave me them duped them
---
Edit: not sure why y‚Äôall r down voting me but ok... I wasn‚Äôt the one who duped them, but thanks for the fake DV internet points
---
for more caps, you could do what mostly everyone does at lower levels like that and just loot as much junk as possible and sell it to npc vendors or use it to make other things like weapons and clothing you can sell as well. and you can even earn more if you utilize the Hard Bargain perk card at max rank and use grape mentats if you can find them to buy cheaper things you need and sell higher as well.
---
When the best part of the game is getting insulted by the game lmao
---
I'm afraid I dont follow, friend.
---
In order to craft the strangler POWER ARMOR
---
You need to go to a power armor station. Place down a power armor frame. And then craft the armor. I don‚Äôt have it myself, but I think you need Vault Steel in order to craft the pieces themselves. Which you need to buy with script at the purveyor.
---
No it isn't. The gifts stay in the economy, they wouldn't drop caps. Removing a fixer, deletes it from the game. Apple to oranges. They only thing they have in common is that they were duped. Bethedsa also removed scrip rewards way before they patched the duping. Players also had to go through the purveyor and she's notorious for giving out junk legendaries. That's why the legendary economy wasn't as hit hard as the cap economy, where it only takes a few hundred presents to hit 30k. You also said you a good number of the presents you had WERE handmade, meaning you used them. If Bethedsa removes the cap drops from presents you already used, why do you care. Unless you have a few thousand "legit" squirrled away on some mule.
---
That's basically the why of it - the quad fires a lot more bullets over a given amount of time. Firing more bullets is always going to be a multiplicative damage buff, but the bloodied damage bonus is becoming additive, which makes it a lot less significant once it's stacked with all of the other buffs a bloodied stealth commando gets.
---
I got insulted last night and it was "The smartest thing about you is that Pip-Boy on your wrist. The dumbest thing is that you use it as a nightlight. Naaaailed it!"
---
From what I've found, turrets have crazy vertical range. I built my camp on a cliff 9 or 10 floors high overlooking a blood eagle camp and the turrets regularly take out those guys before they get in range to shoot at them. 
---
However, the side of camp facing away from the cliff gets picked at by mole rats from time to time, even though that's where most of the turrets are.
---
That‚Äôs the problem though I can‚Äôt find any plans or whatever to mod my weapons and I feel like I explore the shit out of places when I come across them
---
That thing about caps is true, you wanna get as much of that 1400 per day as possible. Also if you really want end game loot then you wanna rush the main quest line for Wastelanders (with the raiders and settlers) so you can do essentially the same thing with gold bullion (maxed at 200 per day).
---
In general, just focus on the main quests until you start leveling and start thinking of/building towards the build you wanna do (heavy gunner, rifle, etc.). By the time you're about done with questing you should be max level and have a better idea of good loot spots. 
---
Theres no real place to get "good loot" in particular, they just drop from legendaries at random, but there are some good events for it like Uranium Fever or, when you're higher level and ready for it, the Colossal Problem. Feel free to tag along on scorchbeast queen fights because every bit helps and its not stuck to 8 person max like Colossal Problem. If theres any particular question you have lmk and I can try my best to give advice. Also if youre on PC, I can probably help with any quests you are having issues with (though its been a while since I did them myself).
---
Can you DM me your ticket number so I can take a look at this?
---
Just launched my second nuke of the day, and disconnected as soon as I hit confirm launch. Two nukes launched, 3 keycards used (I forgot you can't launch from the same silo within 3 hours even if in different servers), and 0 successful runs at ACP. 
---
The whole reason I logged in today was to try doing ACP.
---
That event is what brought me back to the game after I stopped playing for a bit.
---
Thank you so much for all this!

---
Wow! Never seen that site before, dreadful player number loss over the months.
---
That's...completely unrelated to what we were talking about. You are still leveling only for perks past 50. Refining existing gear would only make the currently overpowered things even further above the rest. The point is that launching a game that is built up over years with the best possible gear already there is horrible game design and quickly kills it via stagnation. New things SHOULD be more difficult, more powerful, and more extensive. The old things SHOULD be filtered out of the meta. They should stay viable, but they should not stay on top
---
well my definition of a nerf if when you reduce the stats of something without giving it + to anything in the other departments of Stats, thus nerfing it. like the Bloodied playstyle is the most optimal, at the moment, but that's due to other play styles not being as good
---
Lmao I always use the light
---
Hopefully they make a new loot pool this year, it would suck if the rewards are the same ones everyone already has thanks to the duping.
---
They‚Äôve said they need to do this change to then move on to real weapon balancing. It should be better in the long run. Riflemen will have more options, other than handmade/fixer. 
---
What if you actually carried around a black powder rifle or gauss rifle for big targets?  Handmade kills them before you would finish the weapon switch animation.
---
Yeah, exactly, but in older games there was no chassis, the actual pieces of armor had the machinery in it, built in, that's what the NCR ripped out, so now there's the complete change of that lore because the actual armor pieces have no machinery in them
---
deleted, silly sausage :-)
---
How do you get new legendary perk cards? Can you swap cards?
---
I‚Äôll wait and see how much of a drop it is. I‚Äôm reading things like 80% drop which is ridiculous. I think a lot of people are desperate for bloodied to get nerfed for some reason but it‚Äôs the low health build that gives all the damage. Bloodied is just the cherry on top
---
Nerfing one or two OP builds is much easier than buffing everything else plus all them enemies to compensate buffed player damage
---
Thank you so much!
---
No.
---
at least 5
---
Oof.
---
I‚Äôve been using a vampiric limb damage 5mm minigun. I just got a vampiric explosive 5mm last night. Is it an upgrade or a downgrade? Is it going to break so often that I should just stick with what I have?
---
I rely on it to keep me alive in difficult encounters, because for role play reasons my armor isn‚Äôt good (3 light leather, 2 med combat armor) and I won‚Äôt change it, and I won‚Äôt touch meta builds like bloodied or junkies.
---
Haha you get over it.
---
If you've been joining public teams, you will probably notice that at least half of players are bloodied. That alone should tell you something's off with the balance.
---
I actually like the jingle bell sounds. Way less annoying than the beeping the Treasure Mole Miners made.
---
We need a new loot pool, though, since the presents were duped to hell and back. At least 2 of my characters have all of said plans from that loot pool.
---
Honestly, I'd love legendary perks WAY more if we could get our special above 15 (and use perks for those extra special points).
---
with how many times people post things like this there's a chance it might happen. keep it coming people.
---
Thanks Noob-Noob!
---
if something like this upsets you maybe you should stop playing the game
---
Yeah...every time I see that bot he ends up scrap metal
---
This my point - there is no information to spread here. There are no legitimate solutions to this problem. For everyone person that loses SCORE by being online at the reset, for example, there is a person that didn't. There are no universal factors or causes. It appears to be purely random.
---
Bethesda officially acknowledged the issue multiple times and did nothing to eliminate it. The quantity of posts here cannot emphasize the issue any further.
---
That‚Äôs fine as long as you can get into the bunker
---
they heard from guys with ultra optimised builds that nerfs are fine :V So you know they just belived them :V What can go wrong :V
---
Line in the sand gives you 2full cores as a reward. The best place is probably grinding power plants.
---
The 3 power plants in game :)
---
This literally just happened to me. I‚Äôm loading back into the server rn
---
I'd say at least 10 GB
---
Genius!
---
Hoorah
---
this one will age like milk xd
---
Alrighty what‚Äôs your PS4
---
4 star sharer here
---
There is alot of things to fit in. I think its gonna be almost as big as wastelanders
---
Like I said, they just need to fix the numbers if you're referring to Legacies. Otherwise I agree, but not with changing levels.
---
There aren't any ways to farm enemies anymore, so best way is the power plant workshop, and the line in the sand event
---
I use mainly AA on a low-health build. Bloodied weapons are nice but not necessary. Your BE Handmade will be nerfed but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll notice it too much...
---
Then realize that in the new context, the NCR uses the armor pieces as regular armor without a chassis. They would trim it way down to reduce weight.
---
That detail is so damn insignificant. "Complete change" my ass.
---
Try to grab the plans for a gatling laser, you get 1 with each gun you craft, if you have super duper equipped you also get an extra core for any guns that you get from it. 
---
Try to find a copy of backwoodsmen 3 (I think) for reduced materials when crafting weapons.
---
Change the B2525 Fixer to just a Bloodied Fixer. It stays in the game.  There‚Äôs your Apples to Apples. Thanks for biting, I knew that was going to be your ‚Äòcounter argument‚Äô. That‚Äôs why I worded it that way. 
---
I also never said how many gifts I still have remaining, or what size/type.  Whether it‚Äôs one or one thousand isn‚Äôt relevant.  
---
If the reason to change the content of the gifts is to combat/punish dupers, then any collateral damage that hurts legitimate players is unacceptable. 
---
**Find another solution.**
---
Especially since there is still (and always will be) a legitimate method to get infinite caps. That‚Äôs why I keep saying this is a bandaid solution. 
---
All it does is make people like you feel good and think something is being done to ‚Äòstop the evil dupers‚Äô. It‚Äôs smoke and mirrors.  
---
Dupers don‚Äôt even care about caps. They just dupe what they have to trade for what they want. They don‚Äôt trade in caps. So tell me how hurting their cap income will matter?  Especially when there is still that legitimate infinite caps method available.
---
But then no treasury notes, the event gets completed but you didn't achieve the main task
---
Anybody who has played fo4 frost knows that it won't really work in this engine. I doubt they would change this from fo4, but the system they used there is that the world used giant pre-made meshes or textures that were then applied over the entire map. Think of it as making a giant carpet or tarp that is applied onto a building or plane or something else very large. Adding any slight change to the makeup of this will ruin the entire thing, which in this case causes horrible lagging.
---
The only way this could happen would be if they remade the entire game world from scratch with snow applied everywhere, had that as a separate download, and switched into this for the holidays (the download size for that update would be massive). Otherwise, they would need to add snow as a separate effect that stacked on itself and remained in the game world. This would cause far more lagging than the current tesla bug, and would probably cause a few dozen different physics bugs
---
Imagine grinding your ass of only to get 50 mounted head plans
---
I been using 10mmSMG a lot lately, I find I can hip-target, then quick aim fire to tighten my groups. Short sprays doin work.
---
Enemies being higher level than you will be fixed tomorrow, for the most parts of the map. Try logging back on then if it's getting annoying! Note: likely going to be a big patch to download with it.
---
The problem with buffing everything in the hope it will become viable is the build that gives the most damage is low health, which is associated only with bloodied. Nothing to stop u running nocturnal on a low health build which will still do significant damage. If u buffed say nocturnal to give 90% damage at night and the 50% it would do exactly the same as the bloodied build does now at night and the same as junkies in the day making different weapon types pointless. The damage is in the build and running around at 19% is the handicap for extra damage. Buff full health to the same damage and pass me the vanguard armour id never die
---
That's some damage you got there on your handmade :D Blew him to smithereens!
---
No problem. Any questions let me know. I love your tool so I hope you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm bashing it in any way.
---
Love to see this.

Next time, try switching to a private server, I had a death claw I almost wrote off until I switched to a private server. No camps being in the way might help. Be wary of graham. He gets agro with tamed pets.
---
They did
---
Anyone currently on ps4 wanna do ACP?
---
One of my character's camps is just south of the Watoga train station. I have players all the time come into my tiny trading house. Cranberry is fine just make sure you're not in heavily nuked areas. Having a spot between Survey Camp Alpha and Flooded Trainyard  but not too close to Drop Site V9 would have fairly high volume of traffic during queen events.

Yeah. I have the fireman and the whitespring jumpsuit. Really want the forest camo.

One thing to keep in mind is that power attacks are very effective in update 22.

Also, thanks for all the upvotes! Didn‚Äôt expect it and it was a pleasant surprise :) hope everyone gets roasted just as bad I did ;)
---
People wouldn't be posting such things if there legitimately wasn't an issue. The more people post, and the more that becomes prominent, the better the odds something gets done about it as it isn't getting swept under the rug.  
---
I'd like to think the reason we had ongoing patches (contrary to your "nothing being done by Bethesda" comment) to try and address the points issue is due to all the posts. Yes, they were annoying, but so was the bug, and the posts got less and less over time as the patches started doing what they were supposed to be doing.

I don't know if any other currently available engine is good for the games they make though. The'yd be better off putting effort into cleaning up spaghetti, because they only way they could get a new engine without having to totally change their style and workflows would be to make it themselves.
---
And you‚Äôll have to explain how a bloodied stealth build and quad stealth health build differ other than the bloodied or quad bit. Even on your chart it‚Äôs almost a 50% increase in damage per shot. Low health is the damage build the weapon is just the cherry on top
---
the snow glows light on the mountain tonight 
---
haha your welcome
---
1. You have no order or organization to your thoughts, making it SUPER HARD to understand where one thought starts and one thought ends.  Another issue is so much comes from what appears to be subjective understanding of balance vs. any actual objective understanding of the math.   This is abundantly clear when you make suggestions like Troubleshooters (that‚Äôs the actual legendary effect name) should ignore ALL armor of robots (And 50% of everyone else‚Äôs, but you don‚Äôt even touch on anti-armor, an existing legendary effect). 
---
2. Your idea of ‚Äúbuffing other things‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take into account that as long as we have multiplicative buffs instead of additive, that design will have to be limited.  By making things additive, it opens the room for additional buffs (such as legendary perks) as well as smoothing out the problems that currently exist.  Multiplicative buffs was stupid to begin with.   Can you imagine what the damage would look like from sneak attacks if we still had multiplicative damage after adding in say 40% extra damage from taking one for the team and 30% extra damage from follow through?
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
Those huge spawns of radstags in the toxic valley look pretty juicy.
---
Right yea are Adolf...
---
I'm just going to confess here while nobody cares. Yesterday I joined SBQ hunt and forgot that she isn't going to land in the nuke area. So I was in the field inside the nuke area near V9 fence (to be honest the nuke was too close to V9) aggring SBQ. We killed her just in time, but people were not happy that it had not happened in a couple of minutes. 
---
Okay I did it.
---
You‚Äôll still be doing massive damage, and when you add in the legendary perks (depending on which you choose) you‚Äôll still be fine.
---
Just because someone has taken over a workshop doesn't mean they want to engage in PVP. Some people want them just for the plans and event rewards.
---
If someone has all of the shit built up and unlocked for everyone on the server to help themselves to, and you wait around for them to come back *just* to PVP them? You're being an asshole. And if they express disinterest in PVP and you *keep doing it* because 'iTs a pVP zOnE! iTs fAiR gAMe!', you're not *just* an asshole, but also a griefer. 
---
This game wasn't built to be a PVP paradise. If you want that, go play Overwatch or something. PVP was added as an *option*, not a *requirement*, and taking advantage of people who take workshops for non-PVP reasons *is* griefing. Full stop.
---
Thank! I will.
---
I love hearing him coming. Ohh it's a good day in the wasteland.
---
Thanks 2000 hours play and  I never noticed that .
---
Cool...didnt hear this
---
That's also only on Steam.  76 has only been available through the Bethesda launcher for most of its life, so those numbers probably aren't very accurate.
---
Dude they be like "RAIDER FINNA TAKE YO LOOSE SHIT!!"
---
Got ya I have mine a bit north of Watoga and a bit south south west from the steak house
---
I don't have a pet but I've been to camps where the owner built their base sort of *around* their pet, so they are protected and enclosed. That's one option. But "don't get attached" is also solid advice.
---
Ha! Kind? I'll do that one better. *text break=dramatic silence*
---
.
---
Please hold while we access your account.
---
Just do it like with justice points in WoW
---
I‚Äôm really excited to be able to play everywhere on the map. 90% of it is a waste of time right now. Also, everyone worried about bullets need to go farm for ten minutes, grab a minigun and say GG. Honestly, with heavy weapons, mob health is a non issue. 
---
I feel for the stealth guys, but you have to admit that what you have been doing for the past two years has been anything but stealthy or tactical.
---
But at the moment, you don‚Äôt even need to run bloodied.  Nothing in the game is so challenging that you can‚Äôt complete it with regular gear, there are even youtube videos people did (I think Angry turtle was one of them) where they cleared out an area with non-legendary armor and weapons.  You don‚Äôt need the legendary effects.  Even after this change, you still don‚Äôt need them. 
---
Optimal is not the same as necessary.
---
I think eastern regional penitentiary could be a great spot.
---
The scrounger perk in luck is very useful early on in the game, as ammo is hard to find. 
---
Bloody mess in luck is a must, increased damage
---
np :)
---
Fort defiance
---
Isn't the bloodied playstyle going to remain the optimal choice after the balancing? Also, anything that is optimal is optimal because the alternatives are not as good.
---
The base card gives +3 to all hacking / lockpicking skills.  The max rank is just auto unlock at level 3
---
So you missed the part where players who have been here for a long time will be at a disadvantage compared to newer players as in we will have far less coins at our level.
---
See for example if I own rank 3, 2, 1 versions of hard bargain and open a card pack and get another rank 1 of hard bargain that card went poof. Thats 2 less coins times the countless times thats happened prior to knowing about legendary perks and perk coins and starting to save perk packs.
---
Then for example all those banked extra levels points can be used to buy perk cards to scrap so each point is worth 2 perk coins... except you know I've prolly used 50-100 of them over the years tweaking my build because thats how you move special around so thats 100-200 less per coins I have as well.
---
So while these are estimates arguably veteran players can have or will end up having dozens to 100s of less perk coins for their level then someone who joins new and uses the new system.
---
If they tied those coins to level and awarded the perk coins retroactively it would be the same for everyone  and less of an FU to those who have played for a long time.
---
Not to mention in the future anyone who wants to move special points and change their build is also being told to choose between making a dent in legendary perk grind and fixing or tweaking their build.
---
So yeah I see a problem with it.
---
As for scrapping it could just be something they let us to to clean out cards we will never use.
---
And after, everyone still will.  It‚Äôs still the best.
---
If you‚Äôre running full bloodied commando how much of a decrease in damage are u seeing?  I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre still one shotting everything in the world. I do 200+ on Earle a shot at 30% health how much of an impact has it had on that?
---
I think nuking Morgantown + the airport will be a new meta. Tons of ghouls and scorched, can run both collision course and back on the beat, possibly mama dolces event too all in one nuke
---
it's a secret =0
---
Are you talking about NW, or PvP in Adventure mode?  I thought the whole purpose of NW was to remove the level and equipment advantages that ARE active during Adventure mode PvP.
---
What will this group focus on?
---
Just have them spawn a ton of legendary level 100 enemies. This game has been out for 2 years now, everyone has great builds and we need a challenge
---
I didn't said "use any other existing game engine". I said "develop their own game engine". Please read the comments before answering them.
---
Just so you know, Blizzard and Rockstar handled the problem of creation. I doubt Bethesda is indie-based company never able to reach aforementioned two.
---
It's really not that bad
---
Really?  Did they fix two shot?  How‚Äôs it doing more damage than a bloodied at low health and have the fixer the fact it breaks every 25 seconds?
---
I can still kill things very easily, maybe you're doing something wrong?
---
Last time I was there, I tried the switch four times and it wouldn't open. Another player was there too and tried with the same results. We just gave up, but I'm glad to hear it's fixed. Guess I'll be dropping by the next time I'm playing.
---
I don‚Äôt ever see graham near my camp. I live on the golf course
---
this was pretty easy without being a jerk. find a friend, and kill each other until you both have the trophy :P that way you don't ruin anyone else gameplay!
---
Lol it would certainly switch things up a bit! But I'm the one player that went into daily Ops and was one shot by a robot immediately!! which is pretty much the story of my entire experience in this game since it came out üòÇ
---
Fake news. Cannibalism cures everything lol.
---
I think a lot depends on play style.  
---
I still personally prefer ghouls.  Red Eagles and Super Mutants have dogs that have a high enough perception to sense me sneaking about, and when they \*think\* something is nearby, they still start firing. Mirelurks (when with a queen or king) have poison damage, which is annoying.  Ghouls have no ranged attack, and seem pretty dull witted, I can often just sneak attack them while they lay on the floor.  
---
So I‚Äôll choose the risk vs. reward path and go with the lower risk, especially since it‚Äôs pretty frequent to find the pharmacy ghouls that carry a lot of chems that sell for good caps (IMHO more than what I get off Super Mutants)
---
I got a junkie's handmade, guess that's not bad either..
---
Get a flaming chainsaw and a power armor frame
---
I‚Äôve held on to CH 4 simply because I thought I needed whisperer - so I didn‚Äôt know that either.  I think it was placebo getting the Mirelurk.  I had him for weeks too and he suddenly disappeared shortly around when A.T.H.E.N.A showed up at my base.  Likely coincidence.  
---
After re-watching this video this is what I‚Äôm basing my info off of 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H6-v8QGcsCg
---
The issue is how infrequent these random encounters can be. I haven‚Äôt found another tameable in the Glade in probably 150+ server hops now.  It‚Äôs crazy.  On top of that you need extreme rng to even test out these things (to find a snally for example).
---
If you're extremely lucky you can kill two (weaker) enemies at the same time. Happened to me in Fallout 4 once, but I haven't heard of it happening in 76 yet.
---
It's a fun effect, but the actual benefits are negligible considering the downsides.
---
Like everyone else who has played this game I was in the same boat as you except even worse, smaller stash, no player vendors, and no extra quests from Wastelanders to help level. I set up camp just west of Grafton on the border with the Forest. I would feast on the low level Supermutants in Grafton and Scorched at the fairgrounds and waterpark. Any time I got stuck questing because of high level enemies I would go back to my neighborhood to level up and loot. Keep grinding away and before you know it you'll have a bunch of caps and start to accumulate decent gear.
---
CONGRATULATIONS
---
Better for VATS and shotguns
---
Looks like almost every location is back on the menu. It‚Äôs gonna be a free for all.
---
They died weeks/months ago  .o  ,
---
That's what I'm worried about. Most things getting nerfed I'm alright with but this is too major. What happens when I put 150 levels into this and they nerf it into uselessness?
---
Power armor never had a chassis, never had limited power, and most certainly didn't have the piece system it does now, it's nothing like what it had been from the release of the series, so calling changing how the fundamentals of the armor works an "insignificant detail" is absolute bull. Also, how the *fuck* would the NCR do that? Bolt it to the soldiers bones? They're wouldn't be a thing holding it to them,  they'd walk out of the legs because you don't logically put armor on the bottom of the feet, and the arms would clank right off because the torso would take up their entire shoulder space. Unless they've got supersoldiers with shoulders three feet across and a neck of titanium, not having the frame would be a disaster. Altering the pieces to fit a human without a chassis would render them useless
---
This. I have a main. A secondary both full of legacy and legendary gear. 2 mules full of weapons and another full of armour. I really need to sell some of it lol
---
Ironclad or explosives expert
---
Does that also work with lone wanderer?
---
Ugh. They are making the game into a more grindy mess. I dont play WoW for that very reason.
---
I heard somewhere it‚Äôs not huge in GB size as it is in scope.
---
I tried doing that with a Radpup, but she just kept getting stuck under the foundation or teleporting out of her pen.
---
Till she just want there anymore a day later.
---
The drill sorely needs to be buffed :(
---
Really can‚Äôt wait for this update. Some good places to head back to now. I was using the prison for farming lead and steel forever. Now it will be fun for xp to. Can‚Äôt wait to see how many different legendaries we will see
---
Grind to lv 50 will be harder for people levelling alts, who fight max level enemies while still lv 15 to 25. Because now I have to xp off same level enemies rather than what I can handle.
---
Grind to lv 50 will be much easier for anyone who is playing the game the first time. I think for this group, they can use some help.
---
The build is exactly the same, it's just a weapon swap. I used [these numbers](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-TheFixer_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Suppressor_Prefix-Bloodied_Major-FFR_Sneak_Team_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Nerd-20_Strange_Adrenal_Other-0_Add&amp;right=R_W-TheFixer_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Suppressor_Major-FFR_Sneak_Team_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Nerd-20_Strange_Adrenal_Other-0_Add) for the damage per shot. What it means is that you should probably carry both weapons if you have them, and use the quad for Earl (if you don't mind the ammo usage.)
---
Do the scorched say "Naughty...?" "Nice...?" when looking for players in cautious state?
---
well you just save me 50 perk coins, thanks.
---
Can't you get a friend or online buddy to get a 'wanted' tag and just paste them there and then..? Kinda like the revive challenge.
---
Most of us get wanted by mistake and prefer to lose it quick as. Wouldn't get too upset about wiping them out... üòâ
---
I am not sure I would like a pop up window when I'm in the middle of a fight.
---
You should tell that to the many people who lost SCORE points the last week of the season.
---
Agreed. I would love to see a big buff to both the drill and the ripper to make them viable. They have potential for a really fun 1-handed melee playstyle but the damage is just doo doo
---
I just want the vault stuff
---
I sell all plans for 76 caps.  No more no less.
---
smizzacked_
---
I'm not to worried really. When I can kill a level 95 behemoth in 6 shots with a heavy weapon things are a bit broken lol
---
95% rofl
---
Strangely allows for multiple of said to be stored on the frame too when you get a double.
---
This is just a personal preference, but I really enjoy killing super mutants. I have enjoyed super mutants since fallout 2. They just make me laugh, and are satisfying to kill. But as a bonus they drop big weapons and plenty of gunpowder, and their loot boxes usually contains random meats and bug parts (acid). Their dogs are delicious to boot. So all in all good scrap farming. So I go anywhere super muties congregate.
---
But the point is: farm a spot that's fun to farm, and you'll never grind a day in your life.
---
I mean it's right in the name.  "Nuclear winter" is a drop in temperature caused by all the ash in the sky blocking sunlight.  It was a bit misleading.
---
You're welcome. üëç
---
Are there certain locations that he does up more than others, only met him twice and loved his little quips
---
No they can‚Äôt, if they do its with cheats. 
---
Bloody is the hardest build to compete, armor perks and weapon, takes a lot to get it working properly and you still die a a lot. Anyone who oNe sHoTS da SQB is cheating or stacking food buffs.. 
---
I can solo her if she lands , maybe 2-5 minutes.
---
Tried to solo earl and got my ass handed to me. 
---
 Challenging event without nerfs
---
Im looking forward to CP 2077
---
Have a nice day.
---
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, I get hella ghouls running from the resort, down through the rooms, and into the golf club
---
with water close by
---
All of that was omitted for gameplay reasons in the old games.
---
Leather armor was a full set but isn't anymore. Are you upset over that too?
---
‚òπÔ∏è aw dang
---
You've never been to WV have you? Even out flattest areas are very hilly
---
No worries, I've 2000+ hours as well and I'm still learning new shit.
---
I... don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want that, since they‚Äôre trapped in those suits.
---
I know that feeling
---
I‚Äôve never found a consistent spot - he‚Äôs showed up for me at line in the sand, prime, my camp, foundation, and near wayward. Those are the spots I can think of off the top of my head
---
Isn‚Äôt enemy scaling what made games like Oblivion feel kind of meh because you could never feel overpowered in the end game? I‚Äôm confused why people are excited for this ... unless they just love playing with low level friends? As a solo player, I‚Äôm a bit worried this will break my enjoyment of the game.
---
Even better üòâ
---
Rilly hoping mannequins make it into the atom shop tomorrow.
---
Any idea on how big of an update it'll be?
---
Happens when using bloody mess. Walk up to one of the chunks to loot it and all of its armor and stuff respawn as if it was on the corpse, but since the corpse is in pieces it‚Äôs just the hollow shell of a mutant
---
That was the goal of this post. Happy to help.
---
What you can do is to use another special legendary card you would not have used (but which is already over 5 points)  then transfer the 5 points to charisma. This will cost few transfer points, but you will be able to share cards without waiting for Bethesda to eventually fix the issue.
---
You find the elevator during the quest though.
---
I‚Äôll take that into consideration thank you! I may try getting a few decent bashing damage miniguns on here, fingers crossed anyways üòÇ
---
There are a shit load of scorched at Poseidon.
---
I read covert operative still so ?
---
Player vendors, I find loads :-)
---
Ok! u/sameolddog meet Haradda.
---
Sameoldog is from PC and has some goodies for you if you would like!
---
I get all that. But there will be cases where it still makes sense to take it.
---
I have builds where I'll be taking only legendary special perks including cha because none of the other perks will benefit those characters.
---
Additionally taking legendary perks at 15 counts as a buff di you get ther benefits similar to a chem. 
---
But sure for the average player ops advice is fine.
---
Crit Savvy for sure. You'll kick out multiple Crits really fast... You'll get more damage than with Better Crits, and Four Leaf just doesn't proc enough to be useful on its own .
---
Idk about perks but I do know the legendary effect ‚Äúignores 50% armor‚Äù is going to still be multiplicative after the patch
---
Four Leaf Clover is not nearly as powerful as it lets on.
---
Go with Critical savvy
---
He who holds the most perfectly preserved pies holds Appalachia!
---
Your opinion on the aesthetics of the Pip-Boy is completely separate from your initial complaint where you said it was "impossible" based on the lore for your character to get it.
---
Nah. As I said. Over the course of an earl battle and still having to reload the quad against the bloodied which uses way less ammo I don‚Äôt think the quad is even close to the bloodied. The math doesn‚Äôt work over one clip. Do it over a battle. Solo it with a quad and time it and solo with a bloodied and time it. I‚Äôm willing to bet a lot the bloodied is far quicker
---
Yeah, that's right, I forgot.  I still don't think it's worth it though.
---
You still need good items to trade for other ones, especially if you want Fixers, good armor sets, legacies.
---
Same areas.
---
World domination
---
meh
---
I understand your point but at what point do PvE players understand that its a shared world so they can't have everything. Your camps are immortal now unless glitches or bugs are used, let us have workshops to fight in. Thats not that hard of a compromise.
---
As for PvE players getting into PvP that used to be me, now because I did mess with them I have found fun in it, they can too or stay away. They get the whole rest of the world and can use private servers to get thier build fix on if camps are not enough.
---
Won't happen but just saying, PvE players are just unreasonable with sharing the game world so everyone can have fun.
---
They scale up too bro
---
pretty much, but what I heard is that they were going to nerf EVERYTHING across the board, not just the bloodied effects.
---
I know it'll never be red dead 2 level of snow but maybe if we could just get a light dusting at least like in gta
---
Even if you could, who would buy it? Everyone can get it for free lol
---
Not sure, never really paid attention to it.
---
Do you have an external HD. Save yourself this headache.
---
I am aware of that, but people like the best weapons, the best armor and the best everything pretty much, so if there is a way to make everything on the same level.  While yes its not entirely needed, its still not as good for grinding. most of the games content is grinding, so playing optimal is a byproduct of the grind.
---
You simply said "new game engine" in the comment I responded to, but I do see that you earlier mentioned specifically them making a new one. My bad.
---
&gt;I doubt Bethesda is indie-based company never able to reach aforementioned two.
---
I don't quite know what you mean by this. I know Blizzard "makes" a new engine for most of their games, but Rockstar appears to have just been using RAGE for the past decade and upgrading it along the way.
---
I'll be wearing my Bog-Dweller mask and a boiler suit during Halloween...hopefully the event happens.
---
One thing that I discussed with a friend and they really liked the idea, was to have emote rewards that are horror related. For example, considering all the 50s horror films that were very popular we get animated poses that do famous character moves, like the Mummy, walking along with arms outstretched and the long gaited walk. Or a wolfman howl while crouched down...that sort of thing...would be excellent !
---
Imitate Dracula with your forearm across your face like a cape and shoulders up high, head down...
---
I hope they leave it as it is or I bet there is some PA hater among Bethesda staff otherwise.
---
Normally, I‚Äôd recommend moving to the forest, but with one wasteland, even the forest will be risky. A level 16 megasloth against level 62 ghouls is not a fair fight.
---
Could be fin fun if the next stars are exceedingly difficult to craft/farm mods that require visiting all the major locations in the game. 
---
Allow us to update our favorite weapons while keeping us visiting places that might otherwise have fallen out of favor.
---
Tho many of those will have renewed value with one wasteland already.
---
That's cool, you're allowed to be wrong about what the hoarding game is
---
Thank you very much indeed. Yeah, I'll give it a try, the issue is that she tends to die/dust as she spawns as most players know where and when she'll appear lol.
---
I got a gold pocket watch last time
---
Yes. That is exactly what I outlined and explained in my post as a viable alternative.
---
Would be more fun, especially if BOS tried to attack for launching nukes.
---
I‚Äôm not reading all of this, but by simplifying the way perks are calculated, it‚Äôs much easier to balance. This is just the beginning from a balancing perspective.
---
33 luck and a crit savvy everything you need for your build, trust me
---
I want the jukebox from the Sons of Dane compound. So honky tonky.
---
Negative debuffs, like Grounded
---
Athena would be jealous.
---
Not exactly. From what I saw, it is just a separate effect.  If the target has 200 DR, the weapon treats it as if it has 100 DR. That‚Äôs the way it currently works and should work after update. 
---
The amount of damage done is determined by adding up the danger factors then applying that against the DR.
---
Rilly wanting some mods for the cultist melee weapons.
---
That's a valid concern. They've nerfed before in ways that dramatically impact specific builds without any reparations.
---
Well I meant as an addition to being able to ditch ones you don't want
---
And in terms of practical application, means you sit thru more loading screens for the illusion of control because you cannot know in advance what that will bring you. Hopping servers in hopes of getting better RNG, as you earlier suggested, is a waste of both time and effort. There's no way to spin it otherwise, and trying to do so would be an insult to the intelligence of everybody reading it.
---
There isn‚Äôt a way to bring everything to the same level. The math was flawed at a basic level. They didn‚Äôt change Bloodied to now be 50% max. They just made it so that it‚Äôs not multiplicative when you stack all the possible buffs. That opens room for new buffs (like we are getting with legendary perks)
---
The best weapons are at this point still the best weapons
---
Yeah, I know what you mean. I‚Äôm a sucker and bout Fallout 1st, but I think the scrap box should be for everyone.
---
If you're suggesting a screen pop up on my screen because someone wants a few caps off whats in my vendor and then they spam it... to troll... no thanks.
---
I wonder how many different jukebox tunes they have around the map...and of course why we can't access them.
---
Me too!!!
---
I'll have to experiment with my pathing, that's probably the difference.
---
I was thinking something small in the lower right like the new teams available pop up
---
Ok
---
So how does this effect shotguns? I know it's only 1 extra pellet but how does the damage split within those 9 pellets? 1/9 of the 125%?
---
power plant workshops and gatling laser craft for sure
---
That‚Äôs not how it works. It‚Äôs 107 damage if both hit, each projectile does 62.5% of the listed damage (107) so it‚Äôs working as intended (quite a suprise for Bethesda)
---
Im rather fond of my Minigun with 2 shot. lesser damage on each bullet doesn't matter when your spraying 1000 :P
---
yep still in the game
---
Do you mind wrighting what the equation would be to reach that number?
---
i had one drop over the weekend.  small sample size but it seems to still drop for me.  have also been slowly crafting a secret service set over the past few weeks and have managed to get UNY to show up.  XB1 if it matters
---
It's still dropping. Try sacrificing a small animal to RNGesus.
---
Exactly. And maybe a syringer buff while we're at it. Those 10 radscorpion stingers just don't increase the dps enough
---
Likewise.
---
I mean, it's really OP as it stands. Angry Turtle was standing in front of an Assaultron, taking the full blast from the head laser without it doing any real damage, he'd heal instantly.
---
I have one exactly like that (minus the sights). It's magic at SBQ and world-spawn Colossuses but has only done it once for me against Earle.
---
Pfft like I need more repair kits. Already drop the things all the time because their weight adds up.
---
They want you to grind everything. The whole game and everything new that comes out is about grinding.
---
I'm on PC and it felt like server activity was way down after the Legendary Run ended. Now with a new season and legendary perk cards starting tomorrow, leveling will be a thing again so I expect events will be very active.
---
It isn't that OP, considering it only works vs. energy weapons and PA doesnt get legendary effects
---
yep
---
Hey there Harada. Your new friend Brybry doesn't give up easy. He has reached out to me (a PC player) to offer whatever help you might need. What is your in game name? Mine is Maddog-McSugartitz (aaaaaaaaaand i hope you have a sense of humour) :)
---
Super mutant mirelurk effect..!
---
I got a godrole bloodied/25/25..... Broadsider...
---
Agreed. When I want more cores I just do Powering Up Monongah and claim the workshop. You don't even really need to do the former, you can build a fusion generator to power it, but I've done the power-up process so many times I can knock it out pretty quickly.
---
To be fair - when it was first dropped the legendary run couldn't be finished without a LOT of the bonus ops.
---
They made changes and made it playable by everyone. I'm sure this balancing is just the first step in making more balance changes.
---
Game is way too easy as is currently,  really hoping one wasteland adds a bit more challenge and need for tactics back to the game.
---
For further advancing weapons I kind of like Destiny's approach,  where after that current seasons legendaries have been gathered and well used by all, that an option eventually unlocks to upgrade your favorite legacy gear to bring them up to the level of the current seasons weapons.
---
I would approach that in 76 by making them items that have to be built from difficult to earn components spread across the entire world map.
---
Adding the additional benefit of adding new life to old regions left largely forgotten.  Tho one wasteland will hopefully be a step in that direction already. 
---
Might be a good idea to have them make said weapons untradable/soulbound,  or at least just the completed  upgrade item. 
---
But I would be fine with them being slow to roll out new weapons while so many others are broken or vastly underpowered. 
---
Would love to see unique weapon builds rise up from weapons largely currently considered trash.

I think the choice between 5 in one stat, and 5 PP, versus freeing up 6 PP from infiltrator is interesting.

Radioactive ash storms would be fun.
---
Got the Longshoreman. Thanks boss.
---
There's a saying in engineering circles, an opinion without pi is an onion. Show me the math you are using to back up what you're thinking.
---
In the spreadsheet, (damage per shot x shots per clip) / (fire time + reload time) is damage per second adjusted for reload time. It's *per second*. It doesn't matter whether you're firing 2 clips or 20 clips, as long as you had to reload.
---
Okay, we both know Blizzard is able to make new engine for each of their last project. As for Rockstar... do you know the difference between decade and twenty three years? Gamebryo was released in 1997. Yes, this "Creation Engine" is the same Gamebryo, which has slightly changed since its first usage in Morrowind. Same bugs, same physics, same expliots over and over again. Players aren't blind, they know the similarities, especially some of them who've played Beth games for *decades*.
---
And... i've given you two examples as something Bethesda can achieve as well. Their faults do not justify Beth faults, though.
---
Make an entire post about it, I love your idea
---
Fair enough. 
---
Did you do the wendigo quest? (Not earl)
---
It takes you to an unmarked location. Not that interesting, in fact I think it's a copy paste from 4 but I wasnt sure if you did it.  
---
I forget where you start though.
---
Turrets are such a waste of space, really only good for aiding low level peeps in kiting enemies back to base they might not other wise be capable of downing alone.
---
Camp budget is too precious a commodity.

Great post! Thanks

I agree 1000%

Yup, usually she is shot to bits so fast you have a hard time to find her. If you or a friend have access to a private world it would make recording a video without interference much easier. It's just a matter of time till it pops up, can't trigger it anymore unfortunatley
---
Some weapons just have really poor durability.  I use a variety of heavy weapons and always have gunsmith equipped.  Some like the .50 cal seem to last forever, but others like the broadsider, auto grenade launcher, and missile launcher will break after just a handful of shots.  The broadsider can only shoot like 30 times before breaking even when starting at 200% durability with gunsmith on.  Its insane.
---
DPS is what you should focus on , no just damage. Full Auto all the way
---
I would probably use a handmade or lever semi
---
Sorry I‚Äôm bored of all the ‚Äòmath‚Äô on here. The last straw was the legendary run with all the math saying how it was so hard to complete. Turns out was really easy. And the 80% damage nerf being bandied around. Again. Nonsense. There‚Äôs posts from people playing the pts saying they‚Äôre not seeing huge differences and can do the same as they could before the nerf. Doesn‚Äôt sound like 80% nerf to me?  Have you played the pts?
---

OK then enjoy rolling Nocturnal 10 times in a row. Sorry for pointing out the engine flaw.

Ha! Literally...incapable of speech...üò∂

big if true
---
Just remove durability entirely. Its a stupid mechanic. Having to use two improved repair kits in the middle of the Earl fight is stupid.
---
Again. Rubbish. I completed it before the second x2 weekend with 3 weeks to spare. I don‚Äôt play much in the week. Literally did the daily‚Äôs. Did none of the nw unless it was place a camp and finished very easily. I only had the bug once tho at lvl 99 when I stayed on at reset to see if that was causing it. So would have been a day faster.

Master Infiltrator is more useful to me as the 3 special points for Lockpick and Hacker are in separate specials. But if you're looking for the added bonus of the standard special skill level it may be worth burning two slots maxed out. That's just a lot of coins IMO.
---
Yes, but it's not that bad
---
I see, thanks. Didn't know it was unreliable like that though.
---
And the ‚Äòmath‚Äô included the bonus weekend and double weeklys in their ‚Äòcalculations‚Äô. It‚Äôs all nonsense. Let‚Äôs see what actually drops tomorrow. I‚Äôve not played the pts but it seems those that have are saying it‚Äôs not to bad and ones that are using the ‚Äòmath‚Äô are claiming 80% reduction in damage.
---
I am not exaggerating. I am opening a discussion about my own experience. It may be different to other people.
---
There has been discussion about workshops from before I started playing which was interesting.
---
I keep getting up and down voted too, which is cool.
---
But wouldn't full health have both the benefits of low and high health? Wouldn't that make low health obsolete?
---
4000 script over 5 characters. One bloodied rolling pin, a couple junkies trash items. Rest was trash with a few decent things thrown in. 
---
Best pull was an executioners fixer.
---
Of atleast 160 so we can scrip four 3* weapons
---
Yes please I would also love to hear this!!
---
Thanks, just got the hunters long coat which I've been looking for
---
I regret paying 9K for it. itlegit takes about 10-15% of the budged alone...
---
How much does it cost to change them?
---
The Alien Blaster is getting a damage increase. :) More info tomorrow with the patch notes!
---
I was just pointing out that as it was originally you couldn't finish it without a LOT of the the bonus ops. They changed it pretty soon and added in extra ops, bonus ops etc. etc. to make it possible to finish early even for casuals like myself.
---
They learned from their early failure and the feedback and adjusted it - I suspect they'll do the same with this new damage system.
---
I did the first 120 levels as a sneak lever using sniper. I then changed to commando. You‚Äôll do fractionally less damage as a commando but fire bullets 10x faster. It‚Äôs honestly night and day. And if u want to snipe a quick pull on an auto fires 1 shot pretty much and you‚Äôll 1 shot everything

No no. They‚Äôve got spreadsheets and everything saying it‚Äôs 80% nerf. It‚Äôs gonna need 20 shots to kill a radroach.

To be honest, the fastest way to complete this event is to let the mirelurks reach the island and then gun down the queen.  Currently she's a meager level 25. I don't know if this will be viable if she's level 100 + the weapon nerfs incoming
---
I hate to break it to you but you're playing a video game, it's driven by math. Trust me, I'm a professional video game programmer. It isn't thoughts and feelings under the hood, it's equations.
---
Dropped a Uny yesterday from Earle.
---
As someone who mained a Warlock throughout World of Warcraft's lifespan (and still currently), people complaining about this have no idea what a nerf actually is :D
---
I got some crippling  weapons and perks, but they are not super powerful or OP. Would that work on SBQ if i fight it alone? Do i have to cripple it like multiple times or something?
---
wait wut? the negative buffs from not eating/drinking are going away?
---
Probably atleast 4 specials allowing to use more weapon times or lesser perks that werent worth the limited slots before hand. Putting ammo crafting on an alt. Definently Str for carry and Int for more exp. I wanted to use Chr but someone said it doesnt let you share more perks.
---
That's some crap, I was hoping to share more then a 1 star card with the public groups.
---
I don't think bethesda is that dumb to do something like this. Whether this is sarcasm or not, just take a few seconds to think if anyone would actually want to play the game if they made it that hard. Weapons will be nerfed, but they will be viable.
---
I spent close to 3k in scrip (I was all out of script) during the purveyor sale and got 7 pieces of unyielding fwiw
---
The time zones have a six hours difference, so around 16
---
Didn't they say that they will be removing all negative effects from thirst and hunger, and leaving only the positive effects in place? aka give buffs only.
---
If so, why bother?
---
Personally i will take *Follow Through* and rest will be the specials. *Ammo Factory* will go to my alt.
---
EDIT: Hunger and thirst grow so fast in this game that i barely ever benefit from well fed bonuses in the first place.
---
I‚Äôve mostly run into some cool people vendor hopping.....until today.... stopped at this person‚Äôs camp to check out their vendor.  They fast travel in and immediately follow me around giving me the tesla treatment.  I did absolutely nothing to this person but they kept following/harassing me.  Was really odd.  Everything in their vendor was overpriced garbage anyways..
---
I think jukebox variants would make a great event reward honestly.
---
It‚Äôs planned for the future but there‚Äôs no solid date for when it‚Äôs happening. It will not be in the next patch.
---
lmao no. and hacked weapons will still be rampant on pc.
---
Agree that the guy was inconvenient, and unnecessary comment. But if you look from a different perspective, you were just handed out a powerful weapon. Most likely a duped weapon, but that is nothing to be ashamed of. If it wasn't for dupers people would never have access to those kind of weapons.   
---
At the end of the day, just enjoy your new toy and have fun.
---
On the contrary, I'm glad someone double checked the numbers.
---
you cant pass that lasers. so its better defence than huge doors.
---
Was there a login pop-up letting you know that you were in a targeted zone?
---
Pretty much take the remaining armor % of each peice being applied and multiply them together and that gives you the remaining armor. Sub tract that from 100 and tbat gives you your armor pen value.
---
For example: tank killer 36%, anti armor 50% , and peircing mag 20%  would look like
---
*.64 x .5 x .8 = .256 or 25.6% armor remaing. So it ignores 74.4% armor.*
---
Incisor + Anti armor would be :
---
*.25 √ó .5 = .125 or 12.5% armor remaining aka, 87.5 armor ignored.*
---
% damage reduction gear like sentinels, lone wanderer, slayer armor, dodgy all work the same way.  Another example using 5 sentinel peices. Each peice reduced damage 15% so there would be 85% damage remaining each peice. 
---
*.85 x. 85 x. 85 x. 85 x .85 = .4437 ( % damage remaining)*
---
So you get  55.63% damage reduction from 5 sentinels peices.
---
Fair enough.  I like anything that frees up the perks slot.  Absolutely love the chemists backpack and the other mods.  But I totally get your point of view.  If anything these mini games are a staple of the Bethesda secret sauce.
---
I did not know that and have been playing since April.
---
Only found out last week you can use the bumpers and triggers on controller to speed up the amount of caps you wish to use/take.
---
that post has some wrong info about 4lc.. they say the card says "refill" but in fact the card does say "fill"..
---
I must be getting a hell of a lot of bad luck then, because I can't get many to respawn after the nuke kills them.
---
Yep, it‚Äôs even been a great unyielding week for me. got a U 25Poi Cav urban scout chest yesterday!
---
True, didn't think about that
---
Can these plans be sold to other players?  I find it easier to just buy them and be done with it, like Earl's plans.  I'll never have to do that again, as all I'm missing is the cyberman mask.  And is the brotherhood suit an outfit or underarmor?  I want my regular BOS fatigues back as an underarmor again.
---
This is exactly what I‚Äôm doing also! :)
---
I think I have never seen a comment from you regarding this bug.  u/Valseek u/Ladydevann can you update us?
---
Was doing that for a time. Then adrenaline broke and Haven't changed it back.
---
Daaaaayyyyyyyyum!

The only evidence you've presented here is your claim itself. It would be rather foolish to assume your claim is self-evident, would it not? If you have proof of your claim, lovely. I'll happily eat my words, learning is nice.

---
Not having to select no, I still don't want to open any fucking packs and then aborting picking how I want to spend a level up just to get to the perk screen will make the game a lot less painful.
---
I just can't wait to see all the outrage and drama from people posting who don't follow PTS and suddenly their weapons are super weak.
---
I mean I'm not a fan of the changes but I can see why they wanted to make them and will reserve my judgement after I try to adapt.
---
But the (justified) forum drama for real is what I'm looking forward to...
---
Depends on your playstyle, really:  
---
Want to clean out spawns before finishing of the rest? Semi and maybe a Instigating Lever/Sniper  
---
Want to quickly deal tons of dmg, but have a higher ammo usage (you gonna have to craft lots of ammo if you only use 1-2 different ammo types)? go full auto (with optional AntiArmor/Bloodied/Junkies effects)
---
Honestly unless they add some new plans or items I won't waste time farming them. No point, I already have all the old plans
---
My best interaction I'm so angry I didn't film:
---
I was downed by a Yao Guai, insult bot comes up and roasts me while incapacitated.. then as he said "rest in peace" I died üíÄ
---
That will likely never happen again and I'm MAD.
---
It was a feature in fallout 4. Not sure about the rest.
---
It's possible that plan changed when they decided to introduce this legendary perk. Removing the negative debuff from hunger and thirst seems it would be an easy change that doesn't need to be tied to any larger update and could have been added at any point if they did want to do it as a QOL update. I believe it was originally mentioned to be coming as part of one wasteland and as far as I know it hasn't been on the PTS yet, so no guarantee it is even coming anymore.

Is leather armor the literal ***face of the fucking series?*** I think not. Going from a fitted, mobile, self-sustained suit of high-tech armor to a Frame-based, encumbering, power limited block of titanium slapped on an exoskeleton is a damn big change.
---
What rads? is gonna cure my OCD for having full health.
---
Agree. The ammo converter fix that failed to fix anything is proof of this. They heard the complaints and spent the time making a change but hardly much of one at all.
---
Fallout 76 is one of my absolute favorite games *in spite of all Zenimax‚Äôs efforts to ruin it*. It boggles my mind how bad they seem to be at delivering what the player base wants. However... it doesn‚Äôt ever seem to be enough to push me away. I have a feeling the same psychological NLP work the new social media documentary shines a light on is actually at play in this product too.
---
There's an angryturtle video on YouTube comparing damage output between aa, bloodied, junkies and ts. Tse with demo expert seemed to be the winner but its probably a bug. I'm not on pc so only going on that. I honestly don't know what to expect tomorrow.
---
Did I imagine it or did the dev team say once that we were going to have map changes during the seasons of the year.
---
It is a little late for suggestions..  The nerf is tomorrow.
---
You have to have certain levels of gunsmith perk card in intelligence to craft certain weapons and levels of science to craft energy weapons
---
lmao just wait till tomorrow, that meat hook will be the best weapon ever and totally not a sub 400 wet noodle /s
---
I got a weightless one, which I was very happy with, since its my alternate for when i want to do a lower level event and not blow through .308 or HM ammo. 
---
Now I don't need to use melee for Tea Time, Campfire Tales, or Manhunt.
---
Hello! This is all a bit of a surprise, I have to say. My ingame name is HakadaoftheNeath, and I'm currently online. I have to say, I've never actually used the friends list etc. so bear with me, but I think I've sent you a friend request.
---
(At least I think that's the right name - one name appears when I'm on a team and another when I grab a conduit at Encryptid, so I'm not sure which will appear for you.)
---
I don't get why focus so much on food. I see melee investing perk points to keep their meat from spoiling but if you are not a melee, why bother with food? Inert flux and some meat from time to time and you are set.    
---
Agility hold the best perk cards in the game, there is simply no way to spend points on "thru hiker".    
---
If you are not going for a sneak build, then it could be an OK perk since you will have an empty slot anyway. tl;dr, cool but QOL and not necessary since you already have lightweight food in the game
---
Well, only if you exclusively use a bloodied Gatling Laser/plasma build.  
---
50 cal gets a roughly 48% nerf, combat shotty goes down 47%, Gauss Minigun with 38% and handmade with only 30%.  
---
At least thats what I heard.
---
If you are bloodied and well fed aren't you liable to get a large health drop as soon as well fed wears off, with the potential to kill you immediately??....
---
Not that much, really.  Commandos have got it easy.  I mean, it's less damage, but in the grand scheme of things, you're just holding the fire button for a split-second longer.
---
The ones who are most screwed by this change are the ones who do high-damage one shots because that's what their builds were meant to do - like Riflemen.  Now, it's very unlikely you can drop an enemy in one shot, unless you've got Adrenaline or crits going, so you've got to plan on this extra shot (or two, or three), and for some guns, like the Lever Action Rifle, it's not that practical.  Especially if you are in a swarm situation.  The logic is obvious - if you're going to need more than one shot anyway, you might as well switch to Commando.
---
It‚Äôs fire season. Lol
---
The problem is that the latter event doesn't produce treasury notes.
---
Lmao true
---
Semi auto will no longer be viable after tomorrow.
---
That's a possibility, have to wait until tomorrow and see. And yes, it wasn't on PTS.
---
I was heading into Camp Venture to turn in Technical Data, cleared the ghouls, room is all clear. Hear a noise to my right, Insult Bot appears through the wall like the freaking KoolAid man!
---
I got the 3 plans all legit with a little bit of grinding during the xmas event. I did a few workshops with santa collectatrons. It really wasnt much grinding. 
---
The disclaimer is I opened all presents on a low lvl char because someone said it it had a much higher chance of the grenade plan because some loot was cut off for lower players.
---
I saw you buy low level god rolls for dirt cheap. It all makes sense now(I'm joking)
---
I haven't given this much thought, and don't really care that much about it either, but it does seem One Wasteland does nothing but support your case that leveling seems less relevant now more than ever.....
---
They originally said it would be gone in One Wastelanders (which is tomorrow). But nothing has been heard about the subject for weeks, so who know if/when/ever.
---
How about no limits so people don't play just out of compulsion?
---
We've been investigating this issue for a while now but I unfortunately do not have any current updates on it.

You need to make sure you're hitting the same body part with reasonable consistency, and if your game is suffering low fps that can also interfere with the effect.   
---

We need something like diminishing returns. Ex. anything above the first 150 sells for 1/4 or something.

---
Absolutely terrible in-game.
---
So bad, it's likely that they deliberately give it high drop probability in the Ranged Weapon Legendary pool for exactly that reason.
---
No one can be bothered to tweak its numbers.
---
I've yet to see anything concrete, but I've seen some folks saying bloodied will be seeing a 60% damage nerf. Now I get why, because the multiplicative damage being changed to additive obviously would impact bloodied the most.
---
But holy shit, that's a pretty steep nerf.
---
Only if it glows green and gives constant 1 rad a second.
---
I'll be planning to take it it along with the hacking perk and what rads
---
Radiation Rumble seems to drop them pretty good, but not consistently.
---
Plus quality of life - I hate having to click that much.
---
This game isn't designed for people with jobs that also like other games and a life.
---
I fast traveled to a teammate who was just outside the zone, and it spawned me like 100m away right in the nuke zone as it hit. Didn't even try to run. Just said, well, that's that.
---
Amazing shot for the warning on this. I had planned on getting legendary charisma for this exact purpose. Not a big deal, at least there is a workaround.
---
Rifleman is a bad choice.  You need higher DPS to make up for less damage per shot.
---
What's weird is even with these strict limits you can't even buy your way out of it like most mobile games lol it just seems annoying to be annoying
---
Yeah, there is that.
---
This is an Achievement in the menu - get nuked üòÅ

Still Bloodied Stealth Commando. It will still be the hardest hitting ranged build so there isn't much point in changing. I'll be taking Follow Through and Taking One For The Team. Just gonna lean further in to my build.

How I feel when I take the normal way.
---
You have the ability to slot perks which increase the longevity of both weapons and armor. It might be good to slot it with those extra perk slots you should be getting. Then there's the ability to double-repair things, letting them last twice as long, by swapping in some other cards when at CAMP.
---
I want one that actually fires the pulse beam it hits ME with.
---
I just moved my camp yesterday to a spot where nothing spawns just do that lol. You'll notice if something spawns when you move your device first reload the world see what's around. Sometimes I place a few turret and find another world and see if that will attract anything to make sure.
---
Move the Pip Boy where? The other arm? Or hide it from your arm??
---
But stash weight issue would be resolved. Still a huge W.
---
I don't mind durability being a thing but the whole mechanic is so weirdly done. Each time the weapon fires a round that's when durability should decrease, instead of decrease on hit. TS weapons suffer a lot because of this
---
Yes, I got one and got to keep the stuff
---
I hate being reminded that abomination even exists.
---
Feels more sexual to dump a bunch of 1 star weapons for that last 30. My stash release if orgasmic.
---
Value editing is hard.

I am 100% sure it was not that.

To be fair, the other person asked about fusion cores. That post was arguably worse because fusion cores are obviously easily farmed by taking workshops. Idk where to get plasma cores but I always seem to have at least 20 that I don't use or want.
---
what‚Äôs the use of the legendary special perks?
---
^^
---
No shit same here (2004 to about 2013)! Hey lock buddy! I made a lot of friends and a small fortune providing the materials and escorts for runs into DM for the lock mount. It tickles me what passes for a grind these days :D.
---
What's that?
---
It‚Äôll definitely be noticeable, it‚Äôs just whether or not he‚Äôll feel that it still warrants the reduced hp. At the least, maybe I can get some better bloodied gear for cheaper now
---
I dunno... normal? Always thought automatic receiver was pointless since I can kill every single enemy with a single bullet.
---
I thought they implemented that in the game, similar to if your CAMP can't be placed notification. But, over the weekend I had this happen to me twice, load into a nuke zone and I'm already dead (no PA), not offer to try a different server.

I am on xbox with 300+ plasma cores in my inventory.  Shoot me a chat if you want to buy them at bargain basement prices.

So you're saying it's balanced?
---
Yes, you can request a refund.
---
They‚Äôre not accurate to the total player base at all.
---
Master race people always try to make this argument for Destiny being ‚Äúdead‚Äù, when the reality is that PC players are the minority of the population, and interact with wildly different competitive variables for other games.
---
I hate the stupid decisions, snail‚Äôs crawl fixes, and hopelessly out-of-touch tone deaf approach by the devs as much as anyone else, but console players are the majority bread and butter. All the downvoting in the world by PC players won‚Äôt change that.
---
Shotgun goes down 47%? My shotgun is already literally useless outside of VATS for the last few weeks.
---
That's how it is. Now it's believable.
---
Holy shit. This is def the best comment on here.
---
Im with you !
---
they are broken weapons people are exploiting to do massive unintended damage.
---
How did you refund it?
---
Yes, this is my thought exactly. Personally I go with the "safe" choices like a few of the special increase, and the rad resist one. Also I guess the terminal hack and aiding chem are also safe choice, all though nothing that will make you more powerful in your build. I guess safest all in all, is the special perks.
---
It may take a week or so but I‚Äôve bought things by accident a few times and they‚Äôve always refunded
---
? There's no damage debuff for going auto any more
---
and your camp too..... the turrets are not going to help so expect damage everytime you visit your camp
---

I get a bunch from random events like I had 20 and didn‚Äôt realize it and then changed them over to ultrice and got like 40 with super duper and ammo and then I realized I had another 15 without knowing it. I‚Äôll do random events and get a bunch

Really considering switching from unarmed to commando, tired of spamming stims and this nerf just doesn‚Äôt make melee worth it for me as a bloodied anymore. Would be curious if anyone else who‚Äôs tried both has a reason why they thought one was better than the other
---
It's still complete garbage. 25 to 32 is nothing. It needs to be doing 100
---
My main shares it as their default.
---
Lol trust me there‚Äôs plenty of pvpers who drink colas
---
Not tomorrow.
---
Just swing your arm around lol
---
Or how many we've spent fast traveling or how much we've lost with the 10% sales tax.
---
I‚Äôll let you know after tomorrow. Will have to see which one of the 3 bloodied fixers I have do what and if it‚Äôs worth using them or if the explosive one is better then the other two. Sucks being I just switched my whole build around but I also get why they are doing it. I did get to solo earl once before so at least I got to do that before tomorrow
---
I am willing to go above and beyond and take your 3 star legendaries for free. It's just the type of gamer I am.
---
Maybe because they could be more destructive than other enemies
---
Any excuse for a shopping expedition :)
---
That‚Äôs true I usually don‚Äôt do event but I was doing it a lot during season 1. It will be fun to see what tomorrow brings
---
That answer might surprise you too very soon.
---
I literally dump 3000 steel on top of overseer cache.
---
1 Perk Coin to remove a card.
---
&gt;slightly changed since its first usage in Morrowind
---
You can stop right there if you're trying to say the Creation Engine as used in FO76 is just a "slightly changed" version of Gamebryo as used in Morrowind. It's obviously a built up version, as evidenced by the shared bugs, but the upgrades have been more than some "slight changes". The argument against continuing to use Creation Engine is the technical debt caused by Bethesda not fixing things or the build up of spaghetti, not the fact alone that the engine has history to it.
---
He's asking about "Plasma" cores. The "earlier thread" you mention is about "Fusion" cores.
---

---
Ha ha.  That's a good joke
---
Yeah the power plants will make 3 cores in about 20ish minutes. At Posiedon there's also lead and aluminum and a big puddle you can out industrial water purifiers in. Also in my experience people tend to respect the unwritten rule of not messing with someone's power plant workshop =)
---
It's not that simple
---
I'm wondering what will happen killing those fireflies at the lighthouse.
---

---
Submit a ticket through that link
---
In addition t the ther suggestions - If you dont mind partial cores, raid the PA spawn points - there are at least 12 In the forest, plus the generators.  
---
There are 3 static spawn points in and around Charleston - The core is just sitting on a table.
---
I get them semi-regularly from ghouls at WS.
---
the sentrybot at the battle bots event usually has one.
---
How about that craptastic reward you get for turning shit in? Here's a grenade and some toilet paper, enjoy!
---
Dont like NW or level up challenges. Rest i like/dont mind.
---
That's the issue I'm having with ESO right now. I can never run around and feel like I can dominate things. I don't want to grind to extend game play.
---
I really badly want snow in game, I see it often irl cause it's cold up here, but it'd be special to see snow I could actually enjoy.
---
To be able to equip more perk cards.
---
Also also works if you hit an emote right before landing, skip the whole stagger
---
I tested the poison and fire perks on PTS, and they do work in power armor. I checked with full set of Excavator, Ultracite, and T-65.
---
Thanks man
---
You're going from killing stuff in 1 shot to killing stuff in 1 shot.
---
Stop whining about stupid shit that doesn't even exist as a problem.  Your Daddy will buy you all the repair kits off the shop you want anyway.
---
Specially two clock plans, and 2 random outfits which vary from common to very rare
---
That‚Äôs too funnyüòÇ
---
Holy crap i misread that then!  Thank you for the correction,  gonna delete that part now.
---
Okay then, if *zero current posts* about workshop pvp troubles is an excessive number to you, it's your experience and i'm cool with that. You haven't told anything about that this is your own experience, therefore your post looks like an accusation.
---
But, to *my* experience, you are exaggerating.
---
my bad
---
Even in fonv, hoard box near that robot in goodsprings.
---
To be fair before they patched it, I used to share max rank adrenaline all the time,
---
Anything involving other players in NW are pointless to me, I ignore those outright. Everything else is fine.
---
There are almost certainly hundreds if not thousands of tickets on it. It is well known on the official forums. They know. They just don't have it fixed yet.
---
You are a saint! I will later when I can get on to check what I've got
---
As a shotgun user who got enforcer for this reason this pleases me
---
Tell Bethesda this, I want me some snow.
---
It‚Äôs excellent for stealing kills on a glitched Line in the Sand. Expect to get a proper nuke dropped on your camp if you do this, though.
---
Attention citizens. User creamyzombie has lunched the bike. Bikelear strike is imminent.
---
I've only ever seen ONE lever action in this game. And it sucks not having mods for it.
---
Can someone explain to me what this update is going to change I literally stated playing a week ago.
---
Yea i forgot that damn level up.  Had to make sure i left an alt right on level up incase I had to go to work early the next day.
---
Just swing yes. I will back forth
---
Yeah I feel sorta the same. Not sure about the benefit of squirrel stew though. The act of collecting the squirrel meat, salt and cooking is time that could have been spent farming thousand of xp, I doubt the boost can add up to that much.
---
Scorchbeast brain and other random adsorted buffs, yeah since you will just randomly across them and also fissure sites are good xp.
---
Contemporary Building set
---
Agreed. I want a rocket on the back of my PA that launches me horizontally at big Bois.
---
Edit: annnd I posted this in the wrong spot...oh well.
---
For my commandos I‚Äôll stick with their build but am assembling suits of enemy specific armor for daily ops. Switch to full health for that and then back to stealth the rest of the time. Easy to do as it‚Äôs is just switching gear and radiating/radaway.
---
Nope. Only happebs when the nuke already landed.
---
To be fair... they patched it.  That would make it fairly obvious they believe that only the base values should count.
---
What happens to adrenal reaction? +50 at low health..will that add 50 damage or 50% if it's a flat 50 damage what about with a weapon that does 40 damage per shot . It = 60 damage or add 50 to that 40.?
---
I'm thinking too much into this one thing
---
I think it only aplies if you are on the midle of it? But I already have it. When I saw it I launched a nuke on my head hahaha.
---
They know about the problem. It is literally impossible they don't know, considering how often it comes up here and in the official forums.
---
The point OP is trying to make is this: Posting it over and over here adds nothing to attempts to get them to fix it, but it does help turn this sub into the toxic shithole we all know and love to hate on. We can't make them fix it, but we can at least let the well known and obvious bug rest after a couple solid months of daily, nonstop posts.
---
OP is literally just suggesting that the visitors here do what most well moderated subreddits do with their rules and mods: Stop the repetitive trite horseshit.
---
Apologies for being a pain, but could you do the same for me; I'm in a similar situation and haven't heard anything back in a few days?  
---
Many thanks!
---
Yep. Cant outrun a nuke that close
---
Yeah no joke, are they packing lead in each bill?
---
Gee that's a mature and we'll structured argument. Like I said in the post it's not about one shorting mobs but thanks for your obviously well thought out input
---
Well for the loading screens at least - a bunch of those comments were basically taken straight from F4 and ported over as we all know, like Marine Armour being the best etc, and not applying to F76 at all.
---
Explosives should freaking rock.
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for somebody to come at me when i‚Äôm free. But you know, i already found a few people who like to join.
---
ya the friending is a bit shakey so hang in there and try more than once :)
---
no
---
I'm doing the same, except I'm junkie commando. Other then those two I'm just going to take legendary Specials and move a few things around to add some QOL, and a bit of damage and defense. I'll have about 800 points to spend.
---
And possibly have at least some inherent anti armor like AFAIK it did in the past, AND critical damage on every bullet, even if the damage added by the critical is just 1. I NEED it to ash any and all enemies, except for the ones, for my Captain Cosmos build.
---
Modding laser rifles to shoot alien projectiles and ash 100% of the enemies it kills are the very first thing I do when installing a Fallout game. It would be awesome to be able to have something like that in a game I cannot mod lol
---
I'm waiting for a raider outfit  or maybe its cultists that has a hood with horns so I can use it with my scout mask...looks damn evil
---
Mine is set at 30k caps per-pie. Stop by on by!

I hate all of them.
---
They‚Äôve implemented at least a couple ‚Äúfixes‚Äù but the issue seems to persist. Need to submit tickets so they understand severity and frequency of the problem. No more tickets =seems like it‚Äôs no longer a problem.
---
I have 4 TB plugged in üòé
---
Or claptrap without the annoying voice.
---
Well I know my number would be 10,000 plus. I remember in the early days people would d*pe them and then sell them 25 for 1 cap, I would buy thousands and drink them all for huge profit
---
Thank you kind sir. I was about to make a HUGE mistake tommorow.
---
It has to have over 200 fire rate
---
Does Follow Through only apply to enemies you‚Äôre hitting, or is it applied to anything outside of a target once it‚Äôs activated? Cause that perk seems pretty damn useless when you think about how quickly things die currently.
---
On PTS I was still 2-3 shotting some of the most beefy enemies outside bosses.
---
haha good point - that or the radtoads will suddenly be a nightmare.
---
I'll miss using my laser pistol to get these, low level area's were great for sub-optimal weaponry
---
Really? [Goodwin's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law) within 5 hours?
---
The best insult I got from him is when he just gave me the note.  Not a word spoken.  I kinda felt that was even more harsh then one of his lines.  Like he didn't even think I was worthy or something.
---
Can pistols and laser guns on the whole be looked into reguarding a damage buff?
---
Single Action fire slower but do less damage than a Western while more would make it an actual trade-off.
---
Meanwhile energy weapons on a whole tend to preform worse than their ballistic counterparts.
---
I was at a Queen event where someone else decided to nuke V9 at the same time....when i heard the nuke alert, I checked the map, but it looked like the zone was south. Nope, he dropped the nuke right on top of the rest of us.
---
I am and what rads aswell, bye bye carrying food and radway
---
Also some of the locations are getting a new look plus vault 94 open to explore. Great for the explorers out there.
---
It recently happened to me so this is why I was saying üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Indeed. But those fixes don't hit daily, and these tickets don't come from Reddit. Within 24 hours, they will know if it didn't work because they'll be inundated with tickets.
---
Yea it would be cool for them to be duped tho
---
Lightly tinted green from the radiation
---
Lol one time I was really tired and just claimed a new workshop I had discovered. A level 450 comes along and does the gift emote and drops something so I go over and then I guess I crossed the the threshold back into the workshop and they must've hit the claim button immediately because suddenly I was dead and flying 100 feet into the air.
---
Didnt even take my junk, and they even dropped a stimpack when they pretended to give a gift. My guess is they wanted to try out the potential of their new gun and my lord was it effective
---
I tested this, and "What Rads" reduced radiation to +14/sec in a full set of marine armor and +12/sec in a full set of secret service armor. Still too much for the card to handle (even at max rank), but if you're on a team and using "Rad Sponge" too, it might work. The card does work very well in power armor, hazmat suit, or Chinese stealth armor.
---
Mine was the BE combat rifle i liked using it as a Rifleman weapon but with the upcoming patch tomorrow I'm probably going to have to switch it up now to an automatic rifle instead since the dps will be important for special ops
---
so like if i have legendary perception and have perception at 3 and maxed out on perk cards, i can equip another perk card?
---
I finally ended up buying a plan for it (I think Responder vendorbots sell them) , and craftscrapped my way to the mods. Took a lot of spring and screw farming...
---
A rad snow storm or rad blizzard would be amazing.
---
And ammo is going to become cheaper and more plentiful.
---
Edit: downvoted for stating basic economic principles.
---
Still looking for the TSE Gatling Gun. I have TS FFR Gatling Gun that is my main weapon right now and a backup Vampire Flamer. I love the sound it makes and that it is an instant continuous shot.  I just can‚Äôt get into the minigun or similar wind up weapons.
---
I don't group often so CHA is only useful for Lone Wanderer and Travel Agent.
---
Things like tenderizer that are applied to target as far as i know, and anti armor as well (i think)
---
i hope they let us use the added perk points in our NW load out
---
This is a known issue. We'll see if Beth ever addresses it.
---
I go to a versatile build, commando and heavy :

the only regret, no room for ammo factory (that will be another character that will craft at 150 %, and no room for sizzling style but hee still fireproof
---
I'm sure someone will do a full timed analysis within the week, but remember, things can go up to lvl100 on the east side 
---
of the map now, so it'll probably still be over there
---
Dno why you got downvoted but im pretty sure angryturtle confirmed this
---
Wait that's happening?
---
I agree! If I get a game of NW pretty fast I will do the CAMP and kill non player enemies challenges but beyond that I ignore the NW challenges.
---
I'll second the contemporary set. Actually, I'd recommend a lot of the buildings.
---
If there's a certain item you have your eye on, doing a quick search here will more often than not give you lots of  feedback--some items even though they look good, are just downright janky functionality wise.
---
Also if you try to get a bundle, be sure to read the description first--Beth has a nasty habit of dressing up an entire scene in the previews to entice you, then only sell 1/3 of what you're seeing
---
have you ever heard of radiant quests?
---
There are a lot of quests for both settlements not available in the game files. More than available.
---
Appreciate the small update on this issue. For most of us it really hinders our gameplay experience. I have stopped playing because of it unfortunately. This pretty big issue is going on since Waterlanders and it seems to have no priority to get fixed. All us AMD Navi users are disappointed.
---
Cant help it when im only getting 6 hrs to sleep between ahifts on average though
---
How many caps do most players charge?
---
My camp is on a critter spawn, so I usually have a ton of squirrel without much effort. And salt isn't difficult if you know where to pick some up in places you visit normally. There's a spawn on a table by Mumbles, for example.
---
But yeah, fissure sites are great for XP farming.
---
A *bloodied Combat* Shotgun will roughly drop its dmg to 47% of its current dmg output, but thats if you use the bloodied build effects most people use:- Unyielding set- Adrenal Reaction, maybe Herd mentality- 60 % build perks + Nerdrage + Bloodied Mess + maybe Class Freak- maybe adrenaline on 4/5
---
So taking all those buffs on your weapon, tomorrow it will do 47% of the dmg it would do today, with all those factors above in play.
---
PS: You still nearly oneshot everything, except World Bosses.  
---
PS2: AntiArmor and Instigating are kinda excluded in this formular, since the apply a set rule (50% of target armor/double dmg on first strike)  
---
PSP: You can also use Drugs and Food to buff your dmg to nearly the same levels before the patch hit (provided you werent using those before)
---
I just realized now it's not places based on levels it's place is based on the amount of enemies... I kinda like, that seeing as a lower level it'd be a lot easier to level up because wherever you go you're going to get enemies that match your level sadly that means you won't get as much experience as you would be previously if you wanted to go to a higher level area but it's good this way
---
Well the only problem with the ammo converter is as always the developers lack of knowledge on how to make an actually user friendly menu, even 'till now I don't get it, why didn't they implement an amount slider for crafting, why didn't they made a more useful challenge tracking window, that won't require you to go through 3 different menus to check this one achievement you're trying to finish.
---
I wouldn't even mind the grind if they made some more QOL additions like the ones they did in Wastelanders, even now I believe that the way the quest markers work now is the best addition to the game. The lack of a text chat is a huge problem as well, and the sh*t is, these problems have been raised way too many times before, that no one even hopes that these would get addressed ever.
---
Wait for the mannequins and power armor displays.
---
Get a skisword and melee your way up. If you are on Xbox give you a nice one. Gt. Lord Amexos.
---
On a previous post U said 18% nerf. It‚Äôs now 80%.  Have you actually played the pts because everyone who has are saying it‚Äôs not that bad
---
The real reason for one wasteland
---
Yep, let the suckers who buy the perk do it for us :-)
---
Hopefully they do. Very annoying to waste all these rounds just to miss out on event rewards.
---
I agree. If raw damage isn't the direction the devs want, it should be powerful in other areas. The extremely rare ammunition is enough to keep it as a "gag weapon". Having that on top of terrible damage potential makes it useless, rather than fun.
---
Look at Euclids C-Finder. It had 1shot per day, but boy did that hit hard. Alien Blaster should fill that same niche.
---
Ash piles are still buggy for the most part. I'd love to see 100% ash chance once that gets fixed.
---
he ded
---
If you‚Äôve started a week ago and haven‚Äôt started collecting full sets of legendary gear, I don‚Äôt think the changes will impact much for you. The primary change people seem to be concerned with is how damage multipliers work, whether and how they compound. So some end game gear might start doing a little/some less damage.
---
Everything else appears to be added content for players over level 50, such as legendary perks and more raid levels, and should come apparent to you. I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it and to keep playing, knowing even more content is ready for you in the end game.
---

I just realized if we getting meat weak the primal cuts event is going to be amazing due to the leveling system now
---
Scheduled for tomorrow unless something ginormous happens.
---
don't panic...and be sure to bring a towel
---
Yes, that's the idea.
---
Clearly a
---
Joke. It‚Äôs only 15 for a radroach and 20 for an ant
---
Can run multiple times but the rewards from different tiers are only once daily.
---
20 to 30 caps at times
---
They really should implement the lunchbox confetti visual into FFF, I‚Äôd take that with a minor damage boost any day
---
80%+ damage to people who were killing the SBQ or wendigo colossus in 20 seconds solo. More like 15% for a normal player
---
Well. My bloodied build at 50% health does 100 a shot on Earle. Pretty easy to see how much of a % drop when it goes live.
---
Fallout has always been about freedom to play however you want. However, with 76 builds are a necessity and you can't do everything.    
---
For all the damage perks, the less of them you take or spread out the less damage you'll do. There's no 100% correct way to play it but choices influence outcomes and how difficult and time consuming it will be.    
---
STR looks to be a good start.    
---
PER: is off IMO, b/c you have Rifleman and Bow perks. It looks like you want to be able use any weapon. You can't.    
---
After 50 you can pursue the rest and based on your special you can switch to a degree. You need to whittle down the PER list.  
---
END looks good but I feel Lifegiver doesn't give enough HP for what it takes up.    
---
CHA is good at 4 with LW.    
---
INT - IMO Gunsmith at max rank is good for many reasons. Depending on other SPECIAL choices First Aid at R1 or 2 is good. Pharmacist is situational in it only helps when you use that item.    
---
AGI looks fairly good.    
---
LUCK - Ok but IMO getting more VATS and Crit hits ensures more dead enemies before they can hurt or damage your gear.
---
Ask him if he was born on a highway, cause thats where accidents happen next time.
---
Then open fire.
---
Once upon a time, everyone left their doors open.
---
There was a trust in local communities.
---
People would leave their house for hours and not lock their door. Ok it was shut but that was it.
---
Around the time that the bombs first fell in Fallout 
---
Please uphold tradition and leave your doors unlocked.
---
And if you open a door, at least shut it behind you, it is basic human courtesy.
---
Question is... can others fee you flailing your arm about like a lunatic?
---
I have, unfortunately they are all quite easy. 
---
The flaw with 76 is we grind for these min maxed builds but there's no challenges in the game that actually require it. For example I have a maxed out Secret Service Bloodied Stealth Commando build that lets me take out anything in seconds.  I wanted something challenging for the many end game people in my situation but the Daily Ops isn't it.  
---
I could take a fresh lvl 50 with a set of Power Armor, a Vampire weapon and likely finish the Daily Op within the timer.  It makes you question why we bother trying to get all of this end game gear.
---
Some people do that in case of people with trap camps, he might have thought you were waiting to kill him and take his junk.
---
Please no, I just want them to fix magic weapons and then nerf sbq/earle damage reduction instead, damage to normal enemies is completely reasonable after the patch.
---
I'm very happy with the idea of being able to use 3x lvl 1 damage perks and not losing too much damage for it, instead of being forced into using 3x lv 3 perks.
---
Why would there be?  The de buff is across all builds. If it affects an auto it affects a semi.
---
I tossed that idea out last year. They would have to revert the nerf they did to fog machines though--they cut the number you can have rezzed down from two to one last time I tried it
---
I saw a CAMP a few weeks ago that was set up like a small town. There were at least 6 stand alone buildings of various sizes, each with a different purpose. It was the most impressive set up I've ever seen.
---
Funny, I repair my weapons and armor to 200% durability And have 70 improved repair kits that repair to 150% in my inventory.
---
Bloodied will still be one shotting most enemies.
---
The game wont let me pick up any towels!  .o  ,
---
I thought you were implying that automatic receivers reduce damage compared to semi auto, like how it used to be in Fallout 4
---
Thanks. So sad they didn't make it free :(
---
I'm convinced acquiring plans for weapons I never use has hindered my luck.
---
I'm just sad we didn't get a Dr. Zorbo outfit.
---
I one shot supermutants with 800 damage a shot. On my bloodied commando I do 2400 damage. Are u saying it‚Äôs now going to take 3 shots to do 800 damage down from 2400? That‚Äôs ridiculous if it is and makes the end game a stupidly hard fight. That like 90% debuff
---
According to [this site](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Handmade_rifle_(Fallout_76\)) the base damage increases 5 points for every 10 levels, which would have a level 95 producing 70 (as opposed to 45 for l45).  That's pretty significant.
---
Any chance you can provide a link to this discovery?
---
Has anyone done testing of Fireproof + Sizzling Style?
---
I‚Äôm curious in that Fireproof is % based and applies to explosions like the Scorchbeast Scream, but Sizzling is a flat bonus resist to Fire damage which is like Flamer/Angler damage?
---
Currently I think it‚Äôd be a better choice for my build to get the +5 Endurance and slot fireproof vs use a perk slot on Sizziling, but if sizzling provides better defense against stuff I‚Äôll go with it
---
Does the unarmed explosion perk damage you?
---
Don't make judgments till you have actual experience.
---
The game isn't very well designed as a live service. They struggle to release content fast enough. It's kinda easy to be OP in this game and then it's just a grind game.
---
Eh, I needed a cap sink because I made a bunch of sales in my own machines and couldn't buy Smiley's gold yet. So I buy a bunch at a time to keep myself out of the danger zone cap limit.
---
Cries in excavator.
---
My favorite part will be the players asking why their damage numbers are lower than before.
---
Sooo cheaters with duped quantums and duped explosive lasers/plasma will be on top. Not surprising, considering how hard bethesda has been catering to cheaters in the past year
---
Pretty excited by everything about tomorrow, even the nerf too !
---
For me that will be the new end game tomorrow.
---
I expect to fail at first, and then improve over time. I have no intention of grouping up. 
---
I am looking forward to testing my build against a proper challenge. I have not faced an actual test since soloing a nuke or learning how to vend.
---
Oh for sure. If it‚Äôs that severe it will be tweaked. Altho it‚Äôs been live on pts awhile and the feed back is it‚Äôs not that bad. It‚Äôs the math guys who are claiming massive nerfs of 80%
---
This is golden!  Good stuff, now I'm thinking about doing something similar. The legendary specials are ridiculously good imo.
---
not changing at all other than to add legendary perk SPECIAL cards
---
Oh, okay. It sounded pretty ridiculous so I panicked haha. Thanks.
---
Happened to me too, i fast traveled away just in the knick of time.
---
Put the mod for highest fire rate (penta barrel I think) on it, and it should cause the bug to happen quite consistently (there seems to be some connection to ping, so it will vary from server to server), as long as you're hitting the same body part that is.
---
edit: forgot gauss weapons get explosions, so the bug will trigger consistently even with tri barrel, but it will work better with faster firerate still, and it's nearly impossible to get it to work on flying scorchbeasts, but will work on grounded ones.
---
I think it's usually chameleon armor and people who crouch all the time out of habit.
---
This happened to me too I was put back to where I last fast traveled from so I quickly joined back into my teammate and managed to get back in time for me to still get the rewards
---
My friend does.
---
if you're there, yes.
---
Of course. Why would anyone play at 19% health if they could do exactly the same at 100% health. That‚Äôs why low health is so powerful. Your soft and squishy and the return is improved firepower
---
Can the survival/combat chems be sold/traded/dropped to other players?
---
But it is still useless.
---
What is it with Bethesda destroying iconic weapons and enemies?
---
Everyone remember the Alien Blaster in F3? Man that was OP, but fun, plus it had a limited finite amount of ammo. Then look at it in F4, The variant was alot less OP but still fun. Now in 76 its just trash, it will continue to be trash after the update. Pointless.
---
The Fatman. Nice and powerful in F3. Certainly Iconic. F4, again, nerfed. In 76 complete trash to the point of being a disservice and a joke. On top of having ludicrous weight to ammo to boot. 
---
And, as a bonus, Deathclaws. Terrifyingly hard in F3, to now in 76, weaker and less scary then a damn high level stingwing.
---
Explosive used to be alot better during the early days of fallout 76. This was during the TSE days. Then the pvpers cried and cried and TS and explosive was nerfed into oblivion. The fact explosive sucks is due to the community itself.
---
How bout setting your vendors behind a locked door with a 0 lock to tempt people to try. Then be in there stealthed I'm the corner.
---
Found you! Thank you for the gifts, that was incredibly kind and far more than I ever expected. I mean, I wasn't expecting gifts when I made this OP post even, so today's all been a nice surprise.
---
In case it wasn't clear, I couldn't actually hear you. I've never been able to hear any other player in this game - I've tried all the various suggestions I've seen on this sub from time to time (adjusting settings like turning up and down certain volumes for example) but nothing's worked - however until today it wasn't a problem so I hadn't put in a support ticket or anything. So apologies for that.
---
Honestly, I plan to scrap cards and just sit on my coins for a while. I probably won't buy anything right away.   I am thinking that more changes will be made, none of which will benefit the player. And not just to Electric Absorption perk, but perhaps others too.
---
You're definitely lucky! I tried that, but the "You're leaving the event counter" only had 5 or so seconds left by the time I loaded into the random Forest spot. So I didn't make it back to the event in time, unfortunately. Ended up loading in right after they got their awards.
---
Thank you!
---
How 'bout that hunter's hood that 10% of the players have and which is kinda illegal since it was a duped item from the testing room?  
---
I mean, it IS kinda bad not to get it AND also not taking it away from people getting it through questionable means.
---
It does but not by a lot. I can empty a 25 round mag in the same time you‚Äôll get 3 shots off on a lever. With maybe 10% less damage a shot. I do 2400 a shot with my commando build
---
Lots of trap camps right now apparently. People are taking precautions I guess.
---
I'm not asking for legendary effects for masks 
---
All i want is DR for it
---
I like her more since wastelanders dropped than prior
---
Does that outside vats too. Server sometimes needs a few shots to wakeup and pay attention to damage being caused because of who knows why.
---
Nails on a chalkboard.
---
I love Rose. You don't like a psychotic mix of Rainbow Dash and Elmyra Duff?
---
Spot on. I will add that as far as my spreadsheet and the stats go, melee weapons will see the biggest change at the 15 strength benchmark, due to the new scaling. 
---
I won‚Äôt rule out other weapon balances though for normal guns. I‚Äôll be making note of those as I find them.
---
Only reason to upgrade it is for a berserkers build. I run one and tried the pts a lot so you can survive nuke zones with broken armor and few chems. It‚Äôs a must need for a serious berserker build at max rank or else no nuke zone farming besides bosses
---
Not even full classical tho, just part of a single song that got old instantly.
---
Time for the grind baby
---
You get more Perk slots.
---
I would be utterly shocked if they do. That would be incredibly broken.
---
So basically there's not a safe place on the map anywhere anymore. Because when people are shopping and enemies spawn in based on their level and they don't help kill them then you're going to routinely come back a camp that's been flattened.
---
The bonuses from real food are pretty great with herbivore/carnivore, and IMO we're going to need all the help we can get
---
Kinda redundant, when I only read your post....and it's pretty tied on.
---
Damn that sucks man hopefully they fix it soon and I'm expecting more bugs tomorrow with the patch tbh
---
Nothing is really changing, your DPS will drop but you will still be doing more than any other build.  The only thing I'm doing is maxing out the ammo crafting perk so I can start using Ultracite ammo regularly.
---
Yeah I hate it.  I ALWAYS spawn in the water, every time I go to my base or anyone visits, they get parasites. Would be nice to get fast travel mats like at workshops.
---
The fact you related her to mlp made it worse.
---
But thatvwould completely remove an entire playstyle from the game, no?
---
I imagine this will make encryptid trivial at best. 
---
So long to people waiting for others to show up if people are just soloing it. With a single legendary perk.
---
They're referring to the consistent VATS bug. It happens a lot to me. Lock on, shoot, nothing... lock on shoot, still nothing. Give up and ADS and enemy dies instantly. My favourite VATS bug is when VATS disengages after every shot on a Scorchbeast
---
Maybe I am lucky, I have encountered some griefers and then dispatched them, the odd trap camp which is amusing. No pvp issues at all really. I think it puts people off from playing, I certainly gave it a wide birth on release.
---
As much as I hate to admit it:  
---
NERFING THE DMG IS THE RIGHT WAY  
---
Why? Simple: Magic Weapons can kill a SBQ in literal seconds, and others don't get rewards.  
---
The modifier and "magic weapons" make killing anything really easy.  
---
There is a downside to this, tho; When our dmg is normal, doing ACP or SBQ will not work alone.  
---
Solution: keep the dmg nerf, but add a adaptive dmg resistance/hp adjust for players in the area (and update it every few seconds (30 sec, 1min) to everyone shooting on the world boss (so afk and grievers can't just make it harder to beat)
---
I saw a video that showed that heavy energy weapons were getting a huge nerf for no apparent reason. 
---
I should try to remember to write down my damage numbers tonight so I can see how absurd the nerf actually is.
---
Makes sense. It didn't help that I was just watching in my stealth armor with a .50 cal trying to figure out what he was doing.
---
I AM CANCELLING MY FO1st, I AM UNINSTALLING THE GAME, I AM LYING THROUGH MY TEETH, I AM GOING TO BUY A NEW KEYBOARD BECAUSE ALL THIS FAKE ANGER HAS BROKEN MY CAPS LOCK KEY.
---
...or I may simply give a shrug, maybe an audible 'Meh', and continue playing.
---
Nah they don‚Äôt do jack shit haha bleedout syringe is easier to craft than the radscorpion one and the way to do if you want a poison-like effect. For the amount of time it took to farm those glands, I was so disappointed when I saw what the stats would be that I didn‚Äôt even bother. The Bloatfly syringer is where it‚Äôs at for farming materials anyways.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs awesome dude
---
Have you tried PartyBoy? Triples booze output so you can jack up strength even higher.
---
Depends where you put your Camp. I experimented with placement and found a spot where enemies rarely bother me
---
Honestly I would love if Alien weapons were to get the Gauss treatment with a whole Zetan Arsenal coming as Gold Bullion weapon in future DLCs.
---
Obviously with the Fallout 3/NV skins. Those were much better looking than what we got in 4.
---
Your friend is a psychopath.
---
It was worse?!
---
YEEESSSS
---
Well, you can still use an AntiArmor Fixer, and a bloodied Handmade only looses around 30% of its dmg output (if you use the standart bloodied build with mutations and perks + unyielding)  
---
I will keep my fixer, because it will still be an A Tier Weapon.
---
This, its maximum possible crit rate and all you need to know.
---
Yes, that's my thought too. They will be confused and not even attempt to search if something is already up about the subject. Hundreds of the same post asking "what happened to damage" or if "anyone noticed it or is it just me". Gonna be great.
---
I mean, sure you won't become overpowered, but it also eliminates the grind. You can just play organically without having to stop and farm because your next quest takes you to a rough area.
---
And we could see the sky resort with snow
---
Guy had a glowing DC matriarch inside a fence line sign said fluffy likes to nibble just run youll be ok to get to his overhead camp there was red rocket stairs in the middle of fluffys area was very nicely decorated as a modern house
---
Ok good to know, to the forest will still be the safest spot. Just they're going to have to make defensive structures like the concrete walls, the fences etc tougher. Because if they don't everyone is going to be screaming bloody murder. But it's Bethesda, and it's a Tuesday.
---
There could be a haggle option in the vending machine and if enabled we could set how many % off we would allow for certain items if requested by the buyer.
---
I don‚Äôt know who ace is yet. Idk how many times I‚Äôve tried to shoot/blow her up.
---
Bloodied will go from 1 shotting every non boss enemy to 1 shotting every non boss enemy.
---
Nope. I'm using all of my slots to optimise my PA (with the PA perks and fire/poison resistance) and crafting a shit tonne of ammo.
---
Well you were never going to like her anyway, now you can at least hate her even more.
---
Is there a challenge that you would enjoy?
---
The way backpack skins work has been changed a few months ago. Before it was that each backpack skin was its own item to craft seprately, and skins couldn't be swapped, now you can change skins by modding any backpack.
---
I don't undestand what's wrong with armor? Guessing: if you're wearing BoS underarmor one point one got bugged and was changed as outfit and then back, so if you shielded it you need to do it again.
---
We use the light footed perk so the punji traps can't kill us. Have to be sneaking for it to work.
---
Btw what platform do you play on?
---
I picked my spot in part because there are zero enemy spawns in the immediate area.
---
Was this on the PTS? I generally like to put my camp safe places where I don't need to use turrets much. 
---
Any spots you'd recommend?
---
Disappointed I didn't get an Armourdillo to keep my Brahmin and Chickens company. Heck I would even have taken a Plushie.
---
Just the target that's hit.
---
So far from what I'm hearing, I'm mostly going to be staying with normal perks
---
Not a single camp, but a town. My wife told me about a group that has a set of camps near VTU which they call ‚ÄòLittle Soho‚Äô.  All of the camps are incredibly well designed and themed beautifully. And all of the camp owners were hanging around the ‚Äòtown square‚Äô. It was an incredibly immersive experience. It was very much like what I had originally envisioned this game to become.
---
I think overall you get used to it pretty quick, except when fighting boss or high HP enemies. I presume there will be a ton of backlash, but maybe that'll mean we actually hear about what planned buffs are coming in Thursday's ITV? 
---
Still seems pretty wild to me that they didn't put any major buffs into this patch to offset the changes
---
Twenty-two patches in two years is very reasonable. One of the games (Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online) that I have played where a major nerf is followed up by adjustments to make it more reasonable only has three to four major patches per year with everything else being very minor bug fixes that have snuck through with the patches.
---
https://ddowiki.com/page/Category:Modules_and_updates
---
In fact as it currently stands Fallout 76 is receiving more patches per year than massive budget MMOs like World of Warcraft receive over the course of an entire expansion.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch
---
To be honest I'm surprised they've released as many patches as they have considering their track record with single player games.
---
Oh my god, my boyfriend refused to do any of those quests for so long, every time he logged in Rose would go screaming about stringing his entrails up like Christmas tinsel. By the time I started that quest myself, I had already memorized that dialogue word for word. The first time she said it to me, I said it along with her. I finished those quests as quickly as I possibly could.
---
The fast travel mat would be super useful. Last night I made a really cool CAMP on the bridge west of the wendigo cave, went to fast travel there and I spawned underwater in the lake beneath the bridge
---
Xbox game pass for pc, I think it matches me with steam and Bethesda launcher players.
---
From what I've observed tameable pets only spawn in at under half your level up to an upper cap for combative pets, while critters can be significantly lower. Tho critters seem to live longer because they run away from enemies and players.
---
So should I be ranking up cards today or leave things alone?  Im lvl 363 so I have some dupes I havent ranked and might have 6 rank 1's instead of a rank 1/2/3
---
Yeah, I think they're trying to make it less exploitable. Why ever have Ammo Factory equipped when not making ammo kind of thing.
---
I welcome the post.  A squeaky wheel gets greased
---
This. The magic does happen with the default barrel but not as often; the main hindrance is that the explosive effect that would enable the bug can hit a different body part than the ballistic damage, thus no magic.
---
Actually aiming ::0
---
Wow, that "Fixer vs. the Field" tab. No wonder I feel like my Mutant's 10mm does way more raw damage than any other auto rifle I have. Of course it has the downside that I need to go loud, so Fixer will do more up until I'm spotted, but still...
---
Ah ok, I was gonna hook you up with some starter gear if you were on Xbox. 
---
Happy wandering friend and thanks for the award :)
---
I usually had it equipped just in case a wierd tamable creature spawned in.
---
Even worse this bug has been there since launch.  People only really started to complain about it en mass when the seasons changed them to score
---
Probably not changing much, as I'm slightly more powerful on live than I am on PTS, and my stealth Commando really has no issues on PTS.  I will probably look into taking the 9 ranks of Commando down to Rank 1 of each, though, because it really didn't add up to much of a benefit.
---
I've been proactive about taking what I've learned there.  Both of my Commandos started as Riflemen and wound up as Commandos.  Everyone has a greater investment in Critical Hits and maxed Adrenaline.  The only one I expect to have trouble with is my Gunslinger in Daily Ops.  Revolvers are just too slow to deal with the onslaught, and the Gauss Pistol basically doesn't work, so she's between a rock and a hard place.
---
I am keeping an 3* assaultron head in my stash just in case it becomes usable one day and won't irradiate me after a few shots. Really like the weapon  but currently it is useless.
---
Yeah, I run that and Whiskey for damage, although it might be more beneficial to run Hard Lemonade for the AP boost to help with neverending power attacks (or extra AP for Dodgy). Hard Lemonade is pretty easy to make. Just Vodka, which you find lying around, and Lemonade, which is basically acid and sugar. Then you can replace Party Boy with Tenderizer, Suppressor, Team Medic... whatever might be useful in the moment.
---
Baffles me how people know how to come to Reddit to complain or ask questions, but don't know how to come to Reddit to get the info in the first place.
---
Wow what surprise SKILL IS INVOLVED
---
Using precious budget on defense is gonna suck.
---
Can confirm I gained pets with max budget.  Never was able to keep one alive for more than 3 days but that's a separate issue, or at least I hope it is.
---
Does it drops for console too or just pc?
---
That would defeat the purpose of cloaking
---
Tell that to my level 1 beaver who died in under 24 hours and the guard dog who never even made it to the camp lol.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to being condescended for objecting to berserkers being nerfed out of viability because I‚Äôm a META player only interested in damage
---
See, this is what I am looking for,  it would become the ultimate weapon - grilling everyone/thing into an ashpile.
---
You can't *make* them decloak.  Get ready for a lot more of this with the Camouflaged Daily Op mutation.  I suspect it's the same logic.  They are supposed to decloak while attacking, but in practice, several seconds can transpire before they actually do.
---
Unfortunatley no, they are a pita for any vats based build. The usual countermeasures: shotgun to cripple the legs or a vampire plasma flamer (just point and keep the trigger pulled). If you know you will face some (silo, awol...) get a full set of troubleshooter armor.
---
I‚Äôm for it it will make playing with my level 12 friend fun even though I‚Äôm lvl 509
---
It would be a lot cooler if you did.
---
I will switch from b33 to q33 or v33 or tse while staying low health for unyielding, serendipity, adrenal reaction and nerd rage. Perhaps i will carry more than one gun in the future. I will use 5 legendary perk slots for the special stats and 1 for follow through.
---
I don‚Äôt know what your asking. If the buff every weapon to the same as bloodied and nerf low health builds then there would be no point in going low health. None of that is happening
---
I believe through testing it was suggested that Fireproof really was required to get any real benefit from Sizzling Style. It really boils down to build and where you find yourself taking the most fire damage. My Dense chest piece and L3 of FP and I take basically no fire damage.
---
Can I have one? Please I have been doing to encrypted quest a lot with no luck. I'm on PS4.
---
I have one, but didn't bin it ONLY because it has 90% weight reduction and I was binning the heaviest things first. If you want it, I'm on PC.
---
Keep in mind, nothing keeps you from using a different SPECIAL card and reallocating to Charisma. You lose a few perk cards, but ultimately... not that bad. Max of 28 lost coins while you're spending something like 200 on the SPECIAL card anyways.
---
Thank you, yes there are. And combo follow through/taking one for the team too. Because if just stealth commando &gt; damage boost by follow through, if discovered &gt; damage boost by TOFTT. And the two perks stacks if there are stealth and tanks in the same team cause it's a debuff on the target and everyone taking advantage of it even without the perks
---
wait....it stacks?
---
I predict a disaster with all that they are adding.  Sure to have many bugs.
---
A fixed, known spawn spot would make every griefer cackle and rub their hands together with glee.
---
Have fun spawning into killboxes at random.
---
No problem mate, thanks for the advice! Information is quite scarce for this game, especially with wastelanders changing so much.
---
I just kill it for scrap
---
Season 1 is done and SCORE can no longer be gathered for it. You can start again tomorrow afternoon when Season 2 begins.
---
I have had that happen to me few times (at different %'s). And never could find any fixes i'm afraid.
---
Very true. Although the issue has already been posted about daily for months, and Bethesda has already acknowledged it here, in the ITV, and on their ticket submission form, it makes complete sense that continuing to post about it here will let them know how important it is, and will get it fixed ASAP. Because before, we weren't really serious. But NOW - totally serious. For real.
---
That's odd.  Me and my partner nuke Whitesprings any time we need flux and we usually get 15-20 HRF after hitting the circle of mobs a few times.  Good for fluorescent and crimson. We've never had trouble stocking up on stable flux.
---
Helps if you aim for a clear spot on the map so that the nuke doesn't wipe out any mob spawns at a location.  Also helps to stay nearby so you can loot the same bodies without having to get a hit on them.  If we need cobalt or violet, we nuke Morgantown.
---
It does not. It only applies to the enemy hit.
---
I have a love hate relationship with these things. I like using them only because you can't sell ammo to npcs and players don't buy ammo much. So m forced to use it or ignore valuable ammo, but when you use it, it essentially gives a super low amount of points and charges you a shit ton of points. I once lost all my points to a misclick in that damn thing. I hate it but I'll probably never stop using it
---
nvm i'm r3t4rd3d and misread your comment
---
With 200% durability my BE Dragon can fire 7 shots before breaking. I don't even bother using it anymore.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Can confirm that it is your ignorance.
---
No mate. It was two of the mushrooms, by two trees. They disappeared after Wastelanders.
---
I always picked them with Green Thumb on and they fair built up for a nice collection of Inert Flux...meant I could always sell my purified water.
---
Wait until you get the cloaked Colonel Gutsys in Daily Ops tearing you a new arsehole... :-)
---
P.S Electric Absorption legendary perk is your friend...
---
I don't believe they can be sold or traded to other players, I'm not sure about vendors.
---
I use it even though I despise it. Can't waste all that ammo I hoard up and won't use
---
I'm slowly swapping out my Charisma perks to 9 so I can share 3-stars, but PartyBoy is basically integral to my lifestyle as a raging alcoholic.
---
One of the better achievements. Chasing someone‚Äôs nuke. Standing on the zone. Looking up and snapping a picture.
---
Have you tried submitting a ticket?  I‚Äôve heard some folks received atoms after sending one. Good luck
---
Mostly the same, but probably with more crit perks/legendaries or +33 vats legendaries &gt;!concentrated fire lvl3 is *fixed* on the PTS, turns out it's been over performing this whole time!&lt;
---
For Daily Ops, definitely blocker and fireproof
---
Definitely getting follow through
---
you'll get irradiated ash and like it!
---
I know this game is not without its problems.
---
I had a shit load of them,fast travelling taking forever,blue screens etc..Terrible in game lag,even with audio.
---
Last Fallout 76 update totally killed my PS4 Pro.
---
Cut a long story short, i changed my Hardrive to a 2tb SSHD
---
And have had zero problems since.Literally none.
---
Fast travel takes just seconds. 
---
No way did i think a dying Hard drive could cause me so much grief with an on line game.
---
I had a library worth of error codes previously on my Ps4 Pro
---
Now there are none.
---
Maybe the game is to quick for the write speed of a shite hard drive.
---
They are literally doing this exact thing with locckpick/hacking in next update. Legendary perks. Tommorw
---
This. A missile launcher doesn't wear more when the missile explodes in a group. It's insanely stupid.
---
I probably would play less than 7 months in a year. I like to play intensely when I play, then I stop for a while, often for several months then back to playing intensely every day.
---
I play like this with most of my games. 1 year in advance payments really isnt suited for play styles like that.
---
They did go through a few reversions in PTS but it's not unlike Bethesda to make changes, just how fast those changes are made... a day, week, year?
---
I think with the server lag and all they never decloak for me, i've watched them empty multiple eye lasers without decloaking and go in for endless melee strikes without decloaking. Then a split second every once and a while (literally &lt; .5sec) they are uncloaked, then back to cloaking again for another minute.
---
Waiting for the 500+ post about ‚Äúmy weapon is t as powerful as it was Monday‚Äù complaints.
---
Next season doesn't start till tomorrow.
---
Earl‚Äôs loot really needs to be automatically added to our inventory.
---
That was theorised, yes.
---
This will age like fine milk.
---
&gt;I shouldn‚Äôt be able to solo the endgame bosses in a minute or less and one tap every other enemy that gets in my way.
---
You know what else you shouldn't be able to do? Waste more resources going into a boss fight than getting rewarded for the effort. Maybe you have time and bullets to piss in the wind for that 1 star Nocturnal Rolling Pin, but I value both my time and my bullets.
---
Lmao. Primal scream therapy. Thank you. Now sit down, deep, deep breath. Kittens. Think kittens. There, see? Much better.
---
what do you mean you blocked it?
---
It's going to be great when half my weapons are no longer effective.
---
Score for second season stars tomorrow. Score for season one remains with no dailies to do them. Unknown if they can be purchased.
---
There is a recipe reward for a new consumable that you can get from daily ops launching tomorrow, that makes you immune to fear attacks.

Here's a question, if we're over 50, 100 or 150 in rank, will we be given the chance to make up for already bypassing those points?
---
Yeah, there's something satisfying about downing an entire bottle of whiskey *as* you're charging Earle. I wish it had a corresponding animation, lol.

Me too man, alongside power armor displays. I have one of every set of power armor and ive just been waiting for this moment.

I found that jumping around like a lunatic stopped me running away when others did

Season 1 ended on Sept. 8, so you‚Äôre not going to get score. Season 2 starts tomorrow, then they will have specific daily challenges for score.
---
TIL. I thought Nuclear winter is just ash acting as ''snow''.
---
I forgot about that hood even though I used it constantly in Fo4. If it‚Äôs technically already in the game then we should definitely get it. Do you know if the outfit for the hood was ever in the game?
---
Taming pets is such a buggy ordeal.  Spent 3 days once to find me a pet and dam thing didn't last a day after making it to my camp.
---
Have heard of pets vanishing then randomly respawning after having died months later. 
---
Then theres the trick with pacifying scorched pets so they wont go nuts and attack your camp.

Would you please stop posting this

Quack Surgeon is the closest we get as I dump the booze on their head instead of wasting a stimpack.

Glitched Line in the Sand?

You‚Äôre between seasons wait til tomorrow

Just mute the game for the duration. Only way.

Oh I dont use one, just interested

Ever get stuck for info just shoot me a message
---
Did you have enough time to put your head between you knees and kiss your ass goodbye?
---
I logged off at V9 once... logged in and vaporized while still loading.
---
Yeah, you can actually do the event multiple times off one nuke this way. If you down Earl quick after the event first pops, you can join on a team with someone in a different instance that is still in progress and fast travel onto them to do the event again (so long as it isnt full)
---
I hope it's not too bad because that's all I use.  Maybe it'll force me to try something new, push me out of my comfort zone.
---
Spray and pray
---
There are roughly 3-4 fixed spawn points based upon the current location of you camp unit. If you don‚Äôt like a current spot relocate you camp unit to another part of your camp. This will change all the spawn points.
---
Found a lone hermit crab under a bridge today. Tried to tame but could only pacify. =(
---
You can run it as many times as you want, but you can only get rewards from the tiers once per day. There‚Äôs three different reward tiers. Finish in &gt;16 min you get the low tier, &gt;12 min is mid tier and &gt;8 min is top tier.
---
If you don‚Äôt complete it within 16 minutes, you don‚Äôt get any of the special tier rewards and instead get normal rewards. 
---
I didn‚Äôt see anything about a specific time that the reward tiers reset, but it makes sense to me that it will be the same time for everyone as opposed to individual times, like with selling items to vendors.
---
If anyone else wants to chime in and confirm that what I‚Äôm saying is accurate, that would be nice
---
[here is ](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview) the link to the Bethesda website where some guys from the dev team explain it. Honestly their explanations were kind of bad but the website explains it okay, I think.
---
I remember a little while back, I think this was before the Colossus went live, I found you could "block" the fear effect by being in Photomode when he did it.
---
I don't believe that works anymore, though.

I do wish the range of the attack was telegraphed a bit better.  It has this outer cloud of stretchy blue skulls, but it actually extends beyond that a fair distance.

I just hope I dont have to burn down 90% of my camp to fit even 1 in. If they scale at all like other display items, budget wise.
---
Desperately want mannequins in nurses outfits for my Silent Hill camp.
---
Running melee I used the block move and it didn‚Äôt put fear on me.
---
Can confirm. My alt(my "main" is such a fucked up build I can't even play him) has the brotherhood recon rifle. I entered West Tek yesterday, full durability. Halfway through it breaks. There's no way it should do that with the reduced wear perks equipped.
---
Yeah, don't post a complaint about issues when you can do what this guy does and post a complaint about the complaints about the issues. Big brain shit.
---
Sometimes line in the sand will glitch and instead of the scorched spawning in different spots behind the fence/wall outside of the fort. They spawn all in a large group right in the court yard.
---
Will my fleshlight still work?
---
I use to have a town built for low levels back in the day. But with wastelanders it put a freaking robot cow in my way. I‚Äôll be honest I moved just southeast of Morgantown and rebuilt it but it never felt the same. I eventually moved up north side of Sutton and made a junkyard.
---
It already seems to take 20 just to hit an ant once...
---
I‚Äôve done this to mixed results. Always hilarious results but not always the results I was looking for.
---
Keep it. Angry turtle recently showed that tse is doing more damage than be. Tse May be the new meta come tomorrow if his data pans out post patch.
---
Welcome to VATS. Try it with a gauss weapon, oof
---
Yeah, I saw that. I love the name of it.
---
And make repair kits weight 0
---
It also depends on where you drop the nuke.  I learned that hitting an actual location on the map will prevent mobs from spawning there, so I aim for a random empty spot on the map nearby the area I want to nuke. (So if I want to nuke Whitesprings, I don't choose any of the map markers, I just click a random spot in the cream shaded area in the center of the Whitesprings area.)
---
Whitesprings is my top farming spot for HRF along with fluorescent and crimson flux. Literally go in a circle hitting the first row of houses after the main gate, hit the golf club, drop down to the golf courses, go back up to the second set of houses, then the warehouse/parking lot near the entrance to the resort where the robots usually are.  By the time I'm back to the first row of houses, everything has respawned.  Do this 3-5 times and you have an easy 20 HRF or more.
---
Morgantown is my second top farming spot, but I only nuke it if I also need to farm for cobalt.  Lots of glowing mobs, but they're more spread out than they are at Whitesprings.
---

Well the guy did the panic emoji then the thumbs down emoji then started sneaking.

Mental images I didn't need today part 3:

Yea :) whats better than to booze up for courage :D

Just wait until Tomorrow

The 'old' legendary run finished some days ago, so you cant get score for it anymore. The good news: the 2nd Legendary run starts after the patch tomorrow.
---
Troubleshooter armor will be your friend.

Sort of a mix because her voice reminds me of somebody I knew a long time ago. But too often it drops into that kind of scratchy tone I don't like
---
I think quest are turned off this week because of the update coming out tomorrow.  Saw it in a post yesterday.
---
After maybe 2 weeks of just putting it off I finally finished her quest. I started tuning it out towards the end
---
Spamming the post for 10 times is not gonna help you. And is against the sub rules.
---
All micro transaction games are this way. It's why when some of us heard they'd have the atom shop for "cosmetics" we knew they'd put gameplay enhancing items in there, and lo and behold we got repair kits and scrap kits. Also, using a subscription like FO1st is gameplay altering as well(scrapbox), and is another purchaseable thing.
---
Damn that's pretty good, shame I don't find those prices much on console
---
Season ended. New season tomorrow I believe.
---
The question is, take one level of Infiltrator to have the skills right away; or wait however long for the perk loadouts.
---
Recently I've taken to not bother with anything that requires lockpicking/hacking above 0. Then again, I'm not exactly launching nukes every day.

Sorry I was having a issue posting.

The Legendary Run ended, but it's still showing up. There haven't been any daily or weekly challenges since it ended. I agree, it's confusing for folks who haven't logged in in a while.
---
The Daily Quests in your Pipboy are different from the Dailies for your SCORE. Currently, the season is over so you cannot progress it. Tomorrow is season 2!
---
It's not as simple as linking something. I'd have to show you the data and then spend weeks or months teaching you how to understand the data.

apparently it does, but both of those are items stolen from the "dev room".

Having them is 100% a "illegal" item, even if you bought it from a vendor. You don't get punished as far as i know, but you can't get it officially.

Irregardless, I agree, it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have enough community input as to which prefixes desperately need a buff even with current damage models
---
Do they take damage when they‚Äôre cloaked? I haven‚Äôt played on the PTS I‚Äôm on console but I‚Äôm wondering what would happen if I went for a ‚Äúspray and pray‚Äù strategy involving throwing random grenades too?
---
I prefer 240. A nice number that is devisable by 40 and 24 and 15 and 5 and 3. If you get residual scrip unclaimed with this limit you dun messed up.
---
The legendary run has ended a new one is coming in a few days to a week or so
---
Exactly. When my missile hits a group of 10, it doesn't go back in time and damage the launcher 9 more times. It's ridiculous
---
Come to think of it maybe the instanced camp bunker thing was their solution to this problem. Hopefully once we all start collectively having kittens over this, they'll hurry that up.

---
This may have already been discussed but what is the strat for the legendary ‚Äúperk‚Äù  perk cards. I had planned on leveling my perk slots so they all reach level 15 if possible. 
---
 Is that a good idea or am I missing something?
---
I see your point, but you did get value for the levels you used to respec. You wanted to try new builds or tweak your build on the same character so you used your additional levels to move perks and level up the cards for you new builds. 
---
Others started new characters and have multiple builds that way. 
---
The problem I see which I think Bethesda doesn't want, is that allocating coins for levels achieved without scrapping means that all the players who didn't do what you did have loads of unused levels and perk packs sitting gathering dust. Also anyone with a 500+ level character would have 1000 points immediately to allocate and could automatically max out two cards and be half way on a third or in some cases max out their build on the first day and then have nothing to strive (grind) for. 
---
If you just scrap unwanted cards then there is no incentive in opening perk packs after you have the cards you want. it also means the packs become meaningless. where as now every pack you get during a season is 10 coins towards a level.     
---
For my Legendary perk build on my Lvl 200 rifleman. I'll reduce Perception and Agility by two points each and move them to Luck, that will take four of my saved levels. I'll allocate an agility and perception Legendary Perk card for two slots and should have enough banked points to raise them to 15 each 50 coins each card. .  that leave 3 slots for Master infiltrator and follow through and  a spare with a 4th available at 300. and I look forward to getting to lvl 300.   
---
I don't know what the right answer is but I am looking forward to Legendary Perks
---
Yeah, invisible robots are nightmare fuel
---
I‚Äôm sure i read on an old version of the Fed76 website that the author favoured an auto Combat Rifle, presumably for PVP. 
---
Time to trawl the vendors for one to try out I think.
---
Buddy! We are friends online. Ill invite you on my next session! Prollly in 3 hours. We were gonna do build stuff if i recall. Psn Egroegy.
---
Also im gonna recruit you if you're bored. Im part of this super fun club that just helpa peeps :) youll love it
---
That make sense too. I dont have any of that because I'm genuinely giving stuff away and thats bad for business, for the cheap stuff I do sell.
---
ah, ok. The other guys are probably right and he must have thought it was a trap camp, then.
---
This reminded me of my first time getting nuked, so I wanna share a little story. There  were some dudes who were way stronger than me and harassed me until I gave up my workshop. Like an hour later I get the pop up for death from above, and it‚Äôs on my house! I‚Äôm freaking out cause I don‚Äôt want to leave this world, but like, MY HOUSE!
---
I fast travel to my camp and it was already gone. Somehow I missed the announcement and I had actually been nuked way earlier. Right before I went to my house, I hit level 69, so I have this lovely photo of me in front of my completely destroyed house giving the thumbs up, with the vault-tec ID card showing that I‚Äôm level 69. Definitely one of my fave game memories, I love seeing that photo pop up.

I could live happily if I never saw another mounted head plan again.

How does: "20% chance enemy energy attacks recharge your power armor's fusion core" help exactly? :)
---
I guess we'll see how that goes tomorrow üòâ
---
Its too bad I can't put a sign that says not a trap camp cause that would make people more suspicious.
---
I was so annoyed when I got the game and there is no snow.  Being West Virginia based I thought it would be possible.  Last winter I was hoping maybe.  This winter I will happy if we don't get a game breaking update.
---
&gt; and it‚Äôs one of the best in Fallout 4
---
It was?
---
Ahh one wasteland is another subject entirely. Long needed change though imho
---
Totally agree. But they Will most likely add new plans. What im afraid of is those dang mounted head plans! I cant stand receiving yet another one
---
I haven‚Äôt had as much fun with my TSE Gatling as I‚Äôd hoped. I‚Äôll give it another try. I have been enjoying my .50 with FFR and 50% armor piercing. That thing chews up everything. 
---
And I just found an explosive .50 on an old character that i didn‚Äôt know I had. Still have to try that one out.
---
Yawn tbh. I've lost the capacity to take this sub seriously a long time ago. I've been here since a week after launch and the most upset I've seen people here was when fasnacht was broken for a few hours. Not when nonstop unpunished duping literally crashed servers for days on end, not when the damage bug in all its glory rendered all end-game builds and guns useless at a whim, not when the cancer that was vault raids released in all its broken glory. It was at a stupid fucking fasnacht parade not working on time. 
---
Whatever will happen tomorrow will happen. Fully expect another wave of crying about bethesda ruining the game and people leaving for good and canceling their 1st subs and blah blah blah. Most of them will be back within 2 weeks. The rest will keep reposting the same complaints about the new systems, half of which will be ignorant or outright false. I'm in need of a good laugh, maybe the pvp crew will stage another pathetic attempt at trying to crash servers with their hacked guns in "protest" of bethesda bad. The only legitimate issue I see being brought up is that the damage overflow bug/exploit still isn't fixed when it's been common fucking knowledge for nearly half a year now
---
Rip food builds
---
It's going to be a shit show.
---
What?
---
I do this because I don't want to go to someone's camp and not buy anything and make the seller think their garbage is not good enough.
---
I found out because my right stick walks, so every time I went into my pip boy it would be angled up. Most of the time I would give up and just read the screen even though it was tilted away from me. I played like that for a few weeks until I realized you can change the view. 
---
Side note, I just found out about being able to move camp items without moving yourself. If you don‚Äôt know, select the item, then hold the select button while you use your left stick to move it around. The triggers move the item up and down. Total game changer for me.
---
We care alot \* rhythmic bassline \*

I sell them to vendor

Hmm, didn't consider that. But yeah now that you mention it they would totally do that...

You got man, tomorrows the new board game. I'm making relish right now. Seeing if you wanna run the new board game with me. I'm ps4.

---
Its a dirty job but someone's gotta do it.
---
Modders could prob get it done imo
---
You don't bypass points... Each 50 levels unlocks a Legendary Perk slot, they are awarded to past levels. So if you're level 100 you'd have two slots available. Perk Coins (points) are awarded by scrapping perk cards. Two coins per level. It takes Coins to rank up cards with the first star being free.

Susan: (main) heavy weapons build, E FR Zealot fletched harpoon gun.  Before it was cool to run around with cursed harpoons I was one of few who rocked a one shot scorch killer explosive harpoon gun. And before the hidden nerf would almost always double to quadruple ammo when used die to the fletch rounds. Found a quad variant and noticed my original has far better hit chances than newer ones.

Rudy the Raider: bloodied commando. Two shot explosive combat rifle, bloodied anti armor handmade: the pain this duo can do is amazing. However feeding them is the problem for this scrounger

[REDACTED] unknown build type, currently using two shot anti armor silenced sniper rifle. They never hear it coming.
---
you're right, this is why we cant have nice things.  
---
but hear me out, 3-5 fast travel mats, all must be set a certain distance apart and if you set them all up, you can go to each randomly. preventing spawn trapping. and giving specific location spawns.
---
You do this by being a fallout 1st member and putting down the survival tent on the road outside the gate where they spawn. It fucks up the spawn an causes them to spawn in the courtyard instead.
---
Beaver would be a critter type pet. For which under 24 hours still beats the record some of my previous pets had. XD

I expect things to be on fire for the rest of the week (due to many bugs). I hope the PTS makes a difference for once.
---
I'd be tempted, but having 6 slots means I'll be focusing on more important things
---
We were serious since the beginning.  Bethesda and Zenimax are the ones that dont seem to be taking it seriously
---
I'm not making this up, but I saw a guy at Monaghan Mine nuke the entrance with a fat man. I don't think that's the nuke they were talking about
---
Thanks for the reply, you pretty much got it nailed except the under armor was a vault 76 I believe, well I do remember it was blue lol. And next to my backpack there's the Atom shop icon so hopefully I don't have to buy it again
---
So much so that I power armor glitched through a wall to grab the missing uplink to bypass the quest on an alt.
---
Simpsons did it first
---
I have seen lot's of posts talking about nerfs and such but I haven't been able to find any details on what is being nerfed and to what degree. Bethesda just has the announcement on the big feature points (season, daily ops, 1WL) Is there a link or post im missing?
---
That i did not know. That can't be intended... 
---
EDIT: Watched a video about it, that is obviously a bug that is gonna get fixed sooner, or in the case with bethesda later. The heal effect is way too big for it to be intended.
---
Yeah, until more specific builds are tested and the values are more clear, it's hard to make the perfect choice.
---
Really anyone wearing Excavator is a loot Pi√±ata. Always a jackpot when they die.

Ace is the raider collectron.

He has it hard for Rose.

how is that snarky? it was a polite request.
---
The ash does fall, but lighter particulate matter can stay in the sky for years resulting in a long winter like period.
---
Yes they do take damage when cloaked, only the Imposter Sheepsquatch is immune while cloaked.
---
You did miss it, but it's coming back tomorrow.
---
So excited üòÅ
---
Only if they make it like one of the slidy ice levels like Super Mario World :D
---
Thanks for letting us know!
---
Oh, people are going to kick off, that's for sure.
---
Remember the TSE nerf, worse than that I reckon lol :-)
---
It would be cooler if he shared a perk that isn't working properly???  Instead of one that is? lol
---
Ran headfirst into the point.
---
They have for Fallout 4. I used a couple snow mods last winter.
---
Edit to add: Not necessarily saying they (modders) should do it, unless they're properly compensated for it. Just saying that it can be done.
---
There's what seems to be a random encounter in the Toxic Valley for the Sheepsquatch too.  There's the group of dead and injured super mutants and you can hear the Sheepsquatch call, but I've never been able to find it.  It's right on the hill south of the shooting range on that road.  Not sure if that's glitchy or I'm just unlucky.
---
at least mine can accomplish something.
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! THEY'RE DOING IT!!
---
Fair dos!
---
So it was the same as the marine combat helmet. I guess we just gotta remind the devs that it exists like we did with the marine combat helmet
---
Bloodied will be the least effected, which is why this across the board nerf is cancer.
---
Phew that‚Äôs good to hear üëç
---
Ok I think you may have answered my question. So basically we can get a chance at the rewards (with different percentages) three times a day?
---
&gt; and makes you basically invincible... I see it getting nerfed real quick. 
---
Woah, stop the presses! It makes you invincible to energy based enemies, and when you count that most of them did tickle damage except assaultrons, it makes you immune to assaultrons. All 4 of them roaming the wastes. Truly the gamechanger...
---
Set mine at 420 but that‚Äôs just me
---
It has been data-mined apparently and the way it's coded suggests it fully intended...
---
Way ahead of you m8 :D already went to AT's video to check it out and commented on the edit.
---
I don't think I ever said anything about the exact magnitude of the incoming nerf, but that damage calculator already has an "additive buffs" option that I've been using. 
---
If you're wondering what the nerf does, the math is pretty easy to figure out. Looking at the buffs low health builds use (weapon-specific damage perks, bloody mess, a bloodied gun, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and a powerful automatic receiver), the difference is:
---
1.6 \* 1.15 \* 1.9 \* 1.2 \* 1.63 \* 1.11 = 7.59 (pre nerf math)
---
1 + 0.6 + 0.15 + 0.9 + 0.2 + 0.63 + 0.11 = 3.59 (post nerf math)
---
That's 53% less, which matches up with what people have been saying. If you stack more buffs, like chems, it will be more. If you stack fewer buffs it will be less.
---
The forest is capped at 50
---
I am one of those suckers :) I will buy the ammo crafting card :)
---
All the three-star, sub 50 gear I sell is 420, so I'm trying to break the consistency.
---
Not if you're rocking the short barrel.  hehe.
---
I‚Äôd be fine with that for every event and boss fight to be honest.
---
Your camp is going to be taken down by LVL 50 Radroaches.
---
The amount of people complaining about a reskin would be insane.
---
"I'm never buying anything from the atom store again!" yadda yadda yadda
---
Jesus christ that can't be.. The heal is way too strong. You are basicly unkillable by energy attacks.
---
I‚Äôm looking for to the changes tomorrow, but that‚Äôs probably because I have a team of people I regularly play with. Solo players are really going to get hurt by this update. With that said, I think people are really starting realize that they‚Äôre not playing Fallout 5. This game is like a pseudo-MMO. All the MMO grind, without the massive part. The changes they made (and are making) seems to be heading towards solidifying that point. Look at ESO for comparison. Daily Ops=Daily Pledges, Legendary Perks=Champion  points, Additive calculations=used in most MMO‚Äôs. This game will never be a true MMO, but they‚Äôre trying to get close enough to it.
---
A lot of people that you hear that are quitting the game because of the update (damage nerf specifically). Always mention moving on to other single player games where they can feel powerful and eventually, basically god like. The ones I hear often are Fallout New Vegas, Outer Worlds, Waste landers 3, and a few others. Most of these players wanted Fallout 5. Players wanted story, and the feeling of becoming this powerful character who can‚Äôt be killed. 
---
Unfortunately, for players that want a multiplayer experience and huge team battles. This game was not going in the right direction. Having two or three players do all the work with god builds, was probably keeping other players from having to get better. If you can just show up and do 1k damage, you could literally sit they‚Äôre afterwards and do nothing. While the better players did the heavy lifting. Like, I‚Äôve seen it lol. Hopefully, finally failing these event for certain players, will give them incentive to find a good team to play with like in other multiplayer games.
---
Hopefully, as the games becomes more team oriented Bethesda adds more big group features. I‚Äôd love to see guilds and a global trading market as well. I‚Äôm very excited for the future of the game going forward. Please...don‚Äôt down vote me too hard. Just my opinion lol.
---
A stimpack syringer would be awesome. Or even just a chem syringer. Then I can share my chem addiction immunity with friends and buff them up. But if they're gonna buff the drill and syringer they really need to make it craftable at different levels. Have level 1 syringer and drills be the 5 and 1 damage respectively.
---
Then have a max level syringer do 50 and a maxed drill with piercing bit do 20 or so. This way the drill does about 80 per second but still breaks fast, and the syringer does a modest 50 with a slow reload and only one shot but an extra 40 in damage over time.
---
My real concern isnt budget or amything like that, its will the power armor pieces weigh the same amount when on display, aka 75-100 pounds per display
---
 Craft and scrap gatling plasmas
---
Already had it out, but I get the feeling we're thinking of different things.
---
 Oh well.
---
I saved all my decent rolls from the sale just in case I need to change up my weapons. And I haven‚Äôt used a lvl since I hit lvl 90 so I‚Äôve got over 100 lvls to play with my perk points.
---
I've done that but they seem to have completely stopped answer tickets. You get an auto reply about the score bug and that if you don't reply in 24 hours your ticket will be marked as solved. Respond and the same email just comes again.
---
I have Good News for you!!! The legendary perks are coming Tuesday
---
Something I noticed is that if there's nobody at my camp, the spawn point when I fast travel to it will generaly be the same. But as soon as there's someone at my camp when I fast travel there then it's gonna spawn me in my camp walls.
---
Nope, this is on vanilla. If you place your Camp, take a look at where the enemy NPCs are coming from and move your Camp away from that spot and observe the spawn point again. Took me a while but I eventually found a spot where 90% of the time NPCs will spawn and walk up the road by Camp without interacting with it. Jut required a bit of trial and error and patience
---
Pay them no mind, just secret shoppers sent by Vault-Tec.
---
Perk is working now
---
There is an implied elevator/stairs behind that metal door. As the main entrance is much lower down externally, and you descend quite far to get to the internal door. If you were to try to map out the internal and external entrances they would in no way fit together even after you adjust for the cell scaling differences.
---
A narrow access corridor can be secured quite easily, most medieval castles had a very simple back door, because forcing a normal doorway when there are people on the other side trying to keep you out is suicidal.
---
This is getting a bit old Beefy....
---
The best semi auto rifle imo is the lever action. The fixer modded that way doesn't have the punch.
---
Why not make the fast travel mats apply only to the owner? It would prevent landing right in the middle of a trap for non-owners.
---
Just gonna roll with the punches. 
---
Bloodied players will bitch but not change anything. 
---
Junkies will bitch about AA getting similar dmg without addictions and half will switch. 
---
Those who saw angry turtles video about tse will silently pray for the return of the tse meta while dusting off year old weapons from deep mule storage.
---
I still think there is also a not widely told story about explosive vs FFR in this patch.
---
I wish i could "trap" the insult bot at my camp. Would be a funny way to greet fellow wastelanders when they visit.
---
"Oh, wait. I forgot about the 30 inert flux, 42 deskfans, microscopes, typewriters, and extinguishers, and fusion cores with 23% remaining. I'll drop the Fixer"
---
Oh ok, thank you!

If trapped the bots insult get more ruthless
---
This is actually good news--thanks for clarifying :)
---
No, you do not understand! Half of your weapons going into the trashcan is a good thing! Just trust Bethesda with follow-up balance passes, they have a good track record of it!
---
Serious question: which shared perk people like the most? 
---
I share Traveller Pharmacy 3*, but not sure if QoL perk is appreciated or not
---
Awesome :)
---
I‚Äôm newer to this game and just started watching turtle. It‚Äôs been very helpful learning stuff about end game builds!
---
Unfortunately S1 is over! Items will be sold next season for gold bullion. 
---
S2 starts tomorrow
---
My camp is just south of Grafton Dam in the stream/river valley, rarely bothered even on PTS, maybe once in about 30 visits, if that.
---
You can fit quite a large camp in and still be low profile with it..  https://imgur.com/B2mNENS
---
For number 6 I feel it should be something supermutant related. The divide was suppose to be nearly uncrossable due to how many of them there were. These are great ideas!
---
How nice would some weapon buffs be?? 
---
I hate the damage nerf without buffing certain things. It just pushes the divide between meta and everything else.
---
Here's hoping!! ü§û
---
Edit: I'm referencing the "other improvements" statement.
---
I had better success with Morgantown tbh when I started farming nuke mats. My Whitesprings never yielded the level of ghouls I wanted.
---
Also, next time there's a Queen fight try activating a few ultracite ores in the blast zone. They trigger a mini swarm of scorched each time.
---
I‚Äôd love it if for the whole month of December the entire map was retextured to look snowy like Grand Theft Auto Online.
---
(I remember I got a winter mod for Fallout 4 as well, it was amazing. Something about snow flying in the air and the entire map being white made it magical. It was hard to get around because all the buildings and whatnot were white from the snow so visual landmarks didn‚Äôt click right away. I loved it.)
---
You haven't been here very long, have you..
---
Im really looking forward to the new content and changes. Game needed a refresh anyways. Im a gunslinger main and word on the street my build is one of the harder hit. Thats ok, im still going to keep on truckin. Looking forward to hangin up my junkie guns and breaking out the good ol' AA weapons again.
---
Definately going to tune into the shit show thats bound to happen on lunch break tomorrow. üòÖ.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to it!
---
What's with your UI?
---
Pie spawns ontop of westtek
---
My instigating western revolver and my antiarmor SMG have been with me since forever, while I have bought and sold and scripped tons of faster furious bloodied ninja tacticool killers. 
---
I gave a bloodied explosive fixer to a guy because I didn't see the hype. He tried it and gave it back. 
---
Most weapons can get the job done.
---
I haven't played this game in months but insult Bot will always be my favorite thing about it.
---
Nah. I still need it. I almost wait for it now.
---
How will this change affect boss fights? Are they going to take twice as long and waste more reserves, or will their health/DR go down along with the damage? I only get on this game to drop nukes on the queen/colossus, I don't want to actually have to use the entire 30 min timer along with more stims/bullets. People will stop showing up to the events and they'll become a near impossible waste of time. If I should just read the patch notes, lmk.
---
What do you mean for concentrated fire lvl3 ?
---
I'm looking forward to them as well you do make some decent points.
---
It still just feels wrong leaving veteran players at a disadvantage because for most of our dedication to the game we played as it was. I shudder at all the packs I opened and had cards just dissappear now.
---
At least they made an effort by giving 50 goins for reaching level 50.
---
Infilatrator and ammo factory are the big ones I'm hyped for.
---
See... that's the kind of outside-the-box thinking I'd totally humor if I was Bethesda. üòã
---
I wouldn‚Äôt rank up cards until you plan to use them in your build, or see the final card to perk coin conversion implementation yourself.
---
Nice compiltation, thx.  
---
However from my observations, not all weapons behave the same with mods.
---
Some weapon base damage are increased by mods, some other are not. (combat rifle/fixer is not for example)  
---
At this point I don't know if it's intended, or a bug, nor, if it's a bug which behavior is intended
---
He‚Äôs just really into his role play.
---
I didn't hate her voice I hated that she would talk to you first thing loading in until her quest was done like you mentioned. Why they made her that way when literally no other quest does that I have no idea
---
A bunch of Super Mutants armed with miniguns, rocket launchers and grenades are probably as destructive as a few Blood Eagles/Mothman Cult members. A Deathclaw can also easily destroy a camp before being stopped by turrets.
---
It's probably a oversight that Blood Eagles and the Mothman Cult aren't in the pool of possible camp attackers.
---
Was just minding my own business in my camp and he just strolled on through the door, said it, turned around and walked out. Was laughing for quite a bit after
---
Basically there is just one door and one terminal worth hacking in a silo and kinda the game. It cuts about two minutes though off of the silo and avoids an annoying repair section in a radiated area. I drop nukes occasionally and it‚Äôs just not worth using a slot for that.
---
I‚Äôm getting that because I don‚Äôt wanna carry food and the electrical absorption because it gives you health regen and can be super powerful during daily ops
---
Does he say anthing about ts gauss minigun though their a natural explosive
---
You can just swap picklock and hacker in and out
---
TODD HOWARD KILLED MY FAMILY
---
The Cliffs above the Monorail Elevator are pretty good spots for low enemy spawns. In my experiences of having two camps there, I had a few attacks, but it wasn't a regular thing.  I had one in the grove of trees near the pylon above the elevator, and one [on the far end of the cliff where you can see Huntersville](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sCrw30NNgz9Y7MXWKpPn9Qn5VcF04vmW/view?usp=sharing) from. 
---
On the opposite side, DON'T camp at the archway above Kerwin Mine, I moved there for about 2 days, and had attacks every time I returned to my camp. Sort of sucked, I built a camp using that archway as the door and the build hung off the cliff, but everything in front of the camp was consistently being destroyed, crops(Pre-farmable dirt tiles), generators, etc. all needed to be repaired every time I came back to camp.
---
Just means five killboxes instead of one.
---
Favorites
---
- Complete events: I loved doing events when a lot of players were joining. I wish this challenge came up more
---
- Kill x amount of enemies: I like shooting stuff and it meshes well with normal gameplay
---
- Buy from player vendors: I enjoyed seeing different camps even if I was only buying 3 bullets per day
---
Least Favorites:
---
- CAMP building. I would just build and destroy the same 10 floor pieces or lights or whatever because I'm already near the max CAMP budget as it is.
---
- Claiming workshops. No challenge and workshops have been all but abandoned by the playerbase (except for the fusion core generators or ammo factory)
---
- Level up: I was trying to log on for 20 minutes a day to get the challenges done and leveling up took longer than that so I was annoyed as I server hopped West Tec and the Burrows to get it done as quickly as possible.
---
- Find a bobblehead: I could never find the damn things once I actually needed them. I don't think I completed this challenge at all last season.
---
- Kill legendary enemies: Too much RNG or waiting for certain events with guaranteed legendary spawns
---
- Any Nuclear Winter challenges because I hate playing it and matchmaking takes forever
---
The demo expert isn‚Äôt effected by it
---
Lol, if only...
---
Do they limit the number of legendary special perks you can have at once?
---
Rose is probably my favorite NPC so far. Exactly what I'd picture a junkie Raider crammed into a punked out nanny bot to sound like. Almost has a Harley Quinn vibe, but without the pigtails.
---
So pumped...600+ perk points &amp; 50+ unopened perk card packs, ammunition factory legendary perk maxed out day 1....Ammo Forever!!
---
Except it didn't accomplish anything and people are always going to complain about issues such as this. You should know it accomplished nothing by looking at the comments, and the votes lol
---
You don't need to place an item under it.
---
Swap your wall to brick, place on that nice smooth, flat surface and then switch back to whatever.
---
You may run unto this with other wall hangings occasionally. It happens a lot, just everyone noticed it with the game board being it is large and "new and shiny."
---
My friend has a megasloth and we are going to make a cage  for it so it can‚Äôt get attacked
---
For shotguns, four leaf clover since each pellet can trigger it. Otherwise, critical savvy.
---
I barely use flux so I don‚Äôt really know go well other then doing the boss events. Prob better just going over to market and asking for the ones you want and trade
---
I share level 3 Blocker and no one complains to me. :)
---
Basically only upgrade it if you want a greater decay of radiation. Radiation resistance is a joke in the game past the level one point. You would need 10,000 radiation resistance to equal a broke stealth armor or haz mat suit and a little less to match power armor. Those three things reduce radiation incoming by a certain percentage before radiation is calculated. It‚Äôs a intended but unmentioned mechanic.
---
Last time he came to me he said, the smartest thing about you, is the pip-boy on your arm. To bad you only use it for a night light.
---
Where are all the ppl that said legendary perks weren‚Äôt coming because they didn‚Äôt mention it on inside the vault last week? I‚Äôm so hyped for this update. If I didn‚Äôt have bills and a wife and kids I would not be working tomorrow and I would be home to play as soon as servers come back. I‚Äôm hyped and this is just more stuff to keep me from playing all those games In my backlog. Lol
---
The Italian voice actress for Rose did an amazing job, and I absolutely love her. She's that kind of Fallout style crazy that has been missing from Bethesda games, reminds me a lot of Best Friend Tabitha, and several characters from Fallout 2.
---
I would be very happy if they keep giving her station new lines and a few songs.
---
Can't vats target cloaked afaik.  They should decloak when they attack but yeah.
---
I fought a cloaked mr handy the other day, which was new for me.  He was also shooting like as assaultron laser.  He didn't decloak, even after dead.
---
You forgot that they've 'been here since beta'. It's my favourite. It's somehow legitimising for some people, despite not reflecting actual knowledge or ability.
---
'I downloaded it first!' um yep. Cool.
---
It doesnt bug them it's a feature.
---
Oh no... The fans have turned on me.
---
My explosive gatling as well!   Along with my Bloodied FFR FR combat rifle modded up.
---
It looks nicer, though.
---
yep. the community really let me down today.
---
As a bloodied build, I only use it for rads when I need them. No need for toxic goo
---
Considering Bloodied is getting nerfed hard...probably not.
---
Also definitely not the right place for this.
---
They had it in shop for two days but they‚Äôre bringing it back because so many ppl didn‚Äôt get a chance to get it. Personally I think those rewards should all be in store until season 2 started. But at least you will get it and everyone else that didn‚Äôt. Hopefully everyone that missed it doesn‚Äôt miss it again
---
Yeah they‚Äôll be quite a few WTF bethesda posts
---
Your sarcasm is noted and your displeasure for FO76 over all is clear. Be well, stay safe!
---
I haven't been able to do it enough times to know how to do it and I'm level 150.
---
I can't unhear it now and I hate you for it
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound like proof
---
If you get to Elder on first try all three tiers unlock at once, and you have a very small chance to get 3x rare rewards.
---
Fucker still charges me full price when I let him run his store outta my camp. I should get 50% off at least.
---
Yes, you earn 1 Legendary Perk sot per 50 levels to a max of 6. What you do with those slots is up to you.
---
Yeah i already knew about the exploding gauss effect working as a bridge for the otherwise too low firerate. But im going to do some testing with the penta for more reliable procs.
---
Do explosions from each pellet also trigger it? Cuz if so, I got 16 chances per shot
---
Ok drama queen
---
This!
---
At the risk of being downvoted to oblivion I am looking forward to the nerf, I remember how it was when the game launched and how we struggled to kill the queen, then slowly started to learn methods that worked.
---
Hopefully this will be a journey of discovery and in a few weeks everyone will wonder what all the fuss was about!
---
You can't nerf pissy damage. I deal pissy damage. My DPS be so low I can get nerfed and be buffed.
---
I grab the world pie spawn off the roof at West Tek and put it up for like 45 caps and someone always ends up paying that for it too.  I would feel bad pricing it any higher.  Crap, I feel kind of bad for even pricing it that high lol.
---
Wow... You've been on the grind for a while! Nice work!!
---
Yeah. Have it work and bypass the whole silo
---
Thats where the exploding gauss effect comes in, as the number of hits still make the magic proc in some sense.
---
Yeah these things suck being I‚Äôm a bloodied build. But I‚Äôve gotten good at killing them in stealth so they don‚Äôt activate theirs. I remember before I switched my build and wastelanders just came out that mission where you have to fight one. I swear I died at least 50 times. My character was only built to carry as much as I could. I literally scrapped so many god weapons and armor being I didn‚Äôt know better and I just wanted to hoard. That‚Äôs assaultron still haunts my dreams. Lol
---
I remember pre-Wastelanders there was an issue with the Grafton Mayor repeating the same line when spawning in. I believe it was the line where he asks if anybody can hear him... don‚Äôt know who is more annoying, but that used to drive me nuts until they fixed it.
---
Not when it is an explosive damage type apparently, as the Gauss weapons happen to be passively.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to it. I agree that we shouldn‚Äôt be shredding endgame bosses, and it‚Äôs why I‚Äôve disliked bloodied for a long time. Reigning it in is a good first step. As for other builds... well, if they actually do more with these changes later than just this (which is what I think we‚Äôre all hoping for), then I‚Äôm okay with taking a small dip in my damage for now. Pistols are still getting the help they need thanks to tank killer, melee will still be relatively powerful in close range, shotguns still can cripple for days and heavy guns are just as powerful as they used to be. Bows and rifleman need to use sneak now (which makes uplink even more annoying as a rifleman, but I‚Äôll live), and commando is still the dps king. Overall, I think we‚Äôll come out okay as players, except that we can no longer obtain quite as high of dps numbers.
---
Boss fights will be interesting, though. Except on Pc, where hacked weapons live.
---
Oh interesting, thanks! I did watch his videos on the topic a lot before making this post, so i was certain about most things, but i wanted a confirmation. However i apparently missed a couple things like the hitting consecutively on the same body parts.
---
LOL well THAT just answered a whole bunch of questions! Ya the mic / no mic thing is a pain. At least they finally added an emote for it. I find going to settings / audio / then rotating thru area / team etc often works when theres no real reason why it should. Anyway! You're welcome! Use or sell as you see fit. I think I'm allowed to mention subs since this is main reddit but just in case. PM me if you are interested in joining a group of like minded helpers.
---
Half the time when I had turrets up they would literally shoot each other. I stopped using them. Lol I have a camp up top past lumber yard. But when I was down below Welch I used them and I would have ten of them shooting each other it was so annoying
---
I thought that‚Äôs what the insurgent outfit was. Take an insurgent outfit, Black shovel backpack, and a Reclaimed Deep Mining Helmet, and you‚Äôve basically got a mole miner outfit. (Before they were mutated.)
---
Few people voiced their concern because most are effing clueless. If someone could one shot a trash mob before, now it takes two bullets, that‚Äôs effing DOUBLE the ammo consumption. If in the past you spend some time craft a month worth of ammo, now you need to do the bs crafting twice a month. People are just too dumb to see what‚Äôs dumped on them.
---
Perhaps, but they also haven't added any regular perk cards so my hope is not high.
---
Not sure how Duchess who owns a Sentrybot was able to have a lone gunman get the drop on her when she FACES the door..... She fails at life out here. 
---
Then again, I've never seen that bot kick off. I think it's fucked.
---
But when i launch a nuke all the ghouls die
---
Sorry, I mean specifically legendary perks that increase special stats. I read here somewhere that they might be limited to 1 or 2.
---
Hate hate hate hate her voice. I need to suck it up and just get her quests out of the way already (I'm 190).
---
Yep. The max cap stupidity forces us to dig through market sites online rather than letting us keep playing the game. It's an incredibly stupid design flaw that has us leaving the game to trade items, which is counter to the desires of the developers and stakeholders. I can't believe this hasn't been fixed yet!
---
What do you use because I can‚Äôt solo when she lands with my unarmed bloodied build
---
Yeah just like the twenty posts a day why they can‚Äôt buy anymore season one ranks....  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è gotta love reddit lol
---
I at the very least get Crater and Foundation dailies out of the way so I can get there plans eventually and the dailies for Mr. Fuzzy tokens. Go to the Ohio River Adventures for more Raider Rep. Then clear out enough places to get all the vendor caps that I can for the day and then just make my way through challenges and doing as many events with the ! as I can.
---
"No this is definitely NOT a trap camp, nu uh. Not at all a trap camp."
---
I‚Äôm stealth and think it will be good to be more challenging having to hit an enemy with that extra bullet or two so a mob may need a little finesse which is why I choose to play my character rather than a heavy gunner
---
Instigating auto grenade launcher is a lot of fun.  With vats its easy to hit enemies square in the chest with the grenade and it rarely takes more than a few rounds to down any common enemy.   Unfortunately it breaks fairly quickly but I recently got a second one from the purveyor so now I have a backup!  After I learned that two shot still does 2x dmg for explosive weapons I'm also on the hunt for a two shot one (and missile launcher/fat man).  They aren't the best weapons but explosions are always fun.
---
Flamer is also great fun but it uses a lot of fuel.  I have to stockpile it for awhile before I go on a burning spree for a bit.
---
I agree with you on all points. But why wouldn't you do the wastelanders quest? It opens up tons of gear and plans you otherwise have no access too
---
This is an awesome service to the community. Thanks for that.
---
However, rather than JUST warn the community, we should also be pushing Bethesda to actually fix things so that you CAN share higher tier perk cards with it. Otherwise the card is DOA.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs going to be the friggin Catalina wine mixer of updates.
---
Why all the downvotes? ü§î
---
You cant pass the lasers? Watch me, they still havent fixed power armour clipping!
---
Yeah I had that too. Apparently you can log back in but still-- i didnt have the same amount of success. Each to their own but if I need mats it's Morgantown.
---
you could move points from another special to charisma and then use the legendary to put those back in the other one
---
I hate time limits in games.
---
They removed it in Fallout 4 and put it back in for 76. What purpose does it serve other than selling repair kits in the Atom store?
---
When is the next mole miner event? I know the last one drove me crazy and constantly made me think I heard the treasure hunter radio months after the event ended, but honestly it was fun running a loop around the ash heap on foot with my buddies and brother looking for pails.
---
The only reason It is in the game was for it to be used as base for hacked weapons, lol
---
I agree.. I hate having the option to make a run or complete a daily using a weapon that I I'm not min maxed spec'd.  I was wrong to think it was a fun way to make things challenging.  I am pumped to use only one or two weapons while I  obediently farm for what Bethesda says I need to give them. I promise to stand in line to buy a legacy weapon for real money so I can participate in boss fights so I can have flux.
---
That and the voice for the event in charlestown "DuE tO sWaRmInG vErMiN"
---
What exactly are the actual numbers? All I've seen people say is "damage nerf" and "everything has been adjusted". I'm curious if it's a board-wide X% reduction or if care has been put in to make certain damage sources less impacted. It'd suck total ass if Bloodied just became *more* meta because it was the only build that maintained any sort of reasonable damage output.
---
Sure thing send me a DM with your ticket number!
---
yep, i just was going to get that rank 2 charisma to share level 3 perks (getting charisma up to 9) so those coins would had been wasted on charisma as i wouldn't been able to share said level 3 perks.
---
There was a bug or something at one point where 5-7 of them or so would just randomly spawn in the toxic valley for no reason.
---
I wonder what would've happened if players used the price listed in the item description through all this time? Anybody knows what calculation is involved in that pricing?
---
good question, and tbh im not sure, all i know is that ts shotguns perform quite poor, 
---
id argue that out of all the weapon classes shotguns are one of the worst if youre using twoshot
---
from my experience they seem to either do fairly decent damage or pretty much no damage at all and their accuracy is very bad
---
my guess is (even if it sounds stupid) that 125% of the damage are split in half, you have one pellet that comes from the TS effect and careies 62.5% damage while the other 62.5% damage are then split into 8 or 9 or whatever
---
im intrigued though i try to find a TS shotgun tomorrow and test it üëçüèº
---
Less calm before the storm and more being in the eye of it.
---
If Bethesda doesn't fuck things up as they mostly do and implement things as they are on the PTS, this will likely blow over like the TSE nerf. That's how I see it. Storm in a teacup.
---
But we'll see soon enough.
---
Kittens?  I've been having puppies.  I guess I'm doing it wrong.
---
Not to my knowledge.
---
The insurgent outfit isn‚Äôt what mole miner wore.
---
That's me - and I've been that way since BETA ;)
---
AWOL armaments is a good one. It's hard so not many people and you're guaranteed a legendary and lots of metal scrap.
---
*Cracks open the stash for all the old magic shotguns.* Hello boys, we‚Äôre back.
---
Oh yea, lvl 791 and never respec'd, took a few months off last year when I built a new pc but have been playing every day for the most part, so many friends are wanting to throw their bullet materials my way to get the most out of it thru me...luckily making ammo gives xp and furthers my cause.
---
Oh no, the voice was designed to be grating. Love what the voice actor did with the character but hate the character herself (itself...?).
---
&gt;value both my time
---
When I really value my time I don't play games.
---
Cmon, game should be challenging.
---
Guess you should make your camp look nice for once
---
A hardened junkies fixer has something like 330% more dps than a hardened junkies lever. If you have to fire more than once with the lever you are better off using something else, either carry a hardened fixer too, or double specialize into heavy weapons. Even auto pistols lol.
---
Yeah people really don't do it enough for people to learn
---
I got hit by punjis today.  I usually crouch.  Not sure bout the stealth boy tho
---
this is wholesome. it makes me happy in my heart
---
In my experience I've had to leave the area before leaving the server, so when I log back in to the server I run back into the area. Just leaving the server and coming back never seems to be enough for me.
---
I love insult bot, I run to him every time I see him
---
My normal day: rush to train station for 150 legendary scrip and sell the vendor anything to keep them both on the same 20 hour reset timer. Rush to foundation to turn in 20 treasury notes for gold bullion timer and start the vital equipment daily. Finish daily asap and then travel to the rusty to purchase legendary modules. 
---
Next, travel to cranberry bog super mutant workshop for quick kills for guns to sell to the vendor to hit the 1400 caps. Lastly, afk at camp / jump servers for scorched beast queen event and/or earl. Jump on another game as soon as I hit 20 treasury notes, have enough legendaries for tomorrow's scripping, and everything else I mentioned has been done.
---
They did add cards when Wastelanders came out.
---
In terms of the people referencing that they‚Äôve been here since beta: In my opinion, it‚Äôs a quick and easy way to explain they‚Äôve been around for awhile. If I sat and listed off a paragraph of accolades I‚Äôve achieved, I would come off as a sweaty try hard and get downvoted out of existence. So I just say ‚Äúseasoned player that‚Äôs been here since beta‚Äù because I can probably count on both hands the number of days that I haven‚Äôt logged on since I started
---
We know why works. Auto and heavy. So goodbye rifles and pistols. Great
---
Can it be green irradiated snow ‚õÑÔ∏è
---
This is one of my favorites. Takes a couple of minutes, decent xp, decent junk, at least one legendary (but I‚Äôve had up to 4).
---
But that goes for any game. A new game nobody knows builds, metas and stuff like that.
---
I'm not aware of that but didn't specifically test it either The only limit I know of is you can't level your SPECIAL's above 15.
---
He has not
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY
---
Guess what morgantown is based off of? That's right, mortantown!
---
At the same time, junk shouldn't have  such a small limit though. 800 was easy to hit for me at level 20 once I got there.
---
Hell I just maxed my camp out :&lt;
---
Enemies get tougher, we get weaker.. although I‚Äôm not certain that the queen and Earle are getting a buff as they are already at that ‚Äúmax‚Äù level
---
If I'm server hopping and shopping vendors I put on light footed, goat legs and jet pack. I switch back to damage perks/dense chest for combat.
---
I think some people only shop when the owner isn't there because of various reasons. So they crouch walk to not be seen on the map.
---
If we only had item for item trade mechanics.
---
So legendary perks can you have more than one equipped? Cause i really want this for lockpick and hacking and also not lose on the one for power armor etc
---
Genius!! I'm like 375 or so, but this is my 3rd "main" character. Usually by L150 or so I get bored and start all over. Now that I've been collecting every plan/recipe possible, and all the weapon/armor mods I've unlocked, etc. I'm sticking with this one for the foreseeable future.
---
An automatic fixer is much more powerful than semi-auto but semi is very ammo efficient.  It just lacks the dps for a boss fight.  
---
I use rifleman with a lever-action for most stuff but switch to commando/auto fixer for bosses.   I will have to see tomorrow if I can still 1shot everything with my lever action tho (I expect not).
---
Yeah I‚Äôd rather not make it but the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù tax of someone else making it is like 10 times the price of the materials. So I just continuously smash A for 30 minutes while I watch YouTube on my phone
---
Omg EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I load into the game her voice goes right through me...I‚Äôve delayed her quests so I could get better guns and armor and but now it‚Äôs time to finish her! Lol
---
It converts the damage calculation system from multiplicative to additive. Meaning, the more buffs you receive from perks, the weapon prefixes themselves, food/drink/chem buffs. The less effective it will be vs. live servers
---
Riding Shotgun then Server hopping then Riding Shotgun again. I love selling that backpack plan for cheap and usually a three star pops up. If AWOL or Census Violence is rocking I hit them too. CV has a decent rate for the assault rifle plan and the collectors love that one.
---
Oh yeah? *stalks post/comment history*
---
Kinda introverted. Hard to tell. Why was it heartwarming?
---
No but it looks pretty similar though.
---
I made a couple characters - my crafting characters - that have 12 and 15 charisma so they can share some nice perks.  Feels bad when I play a character that can only share a rank 1 card, but hopefully he‚Äôs contributing more to the group anyhow.
---
I wonder if the same person coded the perk and the masks??  Really makes you think lol.
---
https://youtu.be/uACvFAm6JSM
---
If they didn‚Äôt have a limit, guns would cost millions of caps, they would get super inflated and they already are enough. Max caps keep the economy going
---
It‚Äôs pretty astounding that the unit multiples aren‚Äôt uniform and your current quantity owned are not displayed either. It is *such* poor UI design that it almost feels like it had to be intentionally designed to make it the least useful or the longest time investment possible
---
When does Season 2 start?
---
" will the enemies be high level?" 
---
" Oh no my camp budget for defenses"
---
" Will bloodied still be good?"
---
" Booo!!! Bethesda made bloodied bad, me quit game"
---
Technically everything is getting nerfed.
---
Thanks,  2 days....WTF were they thinking
---
Im excited for the nerf, the game will actually be a challenge again; ill get to relive that feeling I had when I first started + excited to see the interesting builds people come up with; I give it 4 weeks untill a new god mode build emerges haha üòÇ - on a side note these "daily ops" look interesting, im hoping for a bit more team play.
---
Or, put another way, it feels like they are fraking with us. Like when someone gives you what you *technically* asked for but in such a different way than any human being could ever find useful just to spite you.
---
Agreed with all this, but pipe weapons actually do have a singular benefit:
---
Licensed Plumber: Pipe weapons break 60% more slowly and are cheaper to repair.
---
Along with having common ammo types, this makes the weapons last an extraordinary amount of time, especially when in top quality.
---
Should you use them...? No, except the pipe revolver. The pipe revolver still has good damage at the end game (for a ‚ÄòI-don‚Äôt-want-to-use-good-ammo-on-you‚Äô weapon) and extremely common rounds. The regular is crap, especially since the .45 receiver doesn‚Äôt buff damage more than the hardened. The bolt is bad for the same reasons as the hunting rifle.
---
Yeah sometimes a real mothman will be at their base kicking it with them too
---
They lure him in by stealing his eggs.
---
You shut your crazy, common sense, mouth!ü§£ But seriously, how hard could this be to do? I'm a hard no when someone offers in game trades, but I've got lots to offer and would trade if it wasn't such a sketchy joke
---
Except they‚Äôre also patching the ‚Äúrange‚Äù modifications for combat shottys iirc
---
&gt; What I DO know is that posting here accomplishes absolutely nothing. There are no fixes or suggestions that we can give to our fellow Wastelanders to avoid or correct the problem. 
---
The opposite should happen. It should be brought up every time it happens, get upvoted and tag all the CMs EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
---
It's unacceptable that the problem has gone on for this long. It should be hammered into Bethesda over and over until they make its fix a high priority.
---
Being silent of this issue is tacit approval to not do anything to fix the bug. We all know Bethesda is the kind of company that will ignore an issue if people don't kick up a stink about it.
---
No u
---
You get one slot every 50 levels. Up to 6 I think. But u need to get ‚Äúperk points‚Äù by scrapping your unused perk cards to level them up. I don‚Äôt particularly like this system but it does help clean up your perk space. It‚Äôs mainly for veterans and high level players.
---
Didn't like them in Fallout 1?
---
I love Rose.
---
I'd happily trade Daguerre and her bullshit headaches and recurring nightmares for Rose.
---
I'd happily launch Daguerre back into space to float forever.
---
Thanks for the replies and yeah then it defiantly won‚Äôt affect me. I‚Äôm like level 11 or 12.
---
Thanks guys! Already have the contemporary from my first month of having it, was hoping the red rocket garage door was still about but guess not!
---
don't think so. I didn't have a problem with challenges back when they only gave atoms because money is not timegated. I could always just buy more atoms if need be.
---
but I absolutely despise being treated like a child and having to do my daily chores before I can actually get back to playing the damn game.
---
This. Never miss an AWOL. Probably should keep it hush hush though, just between us ok?
---
The launching of the fatman is mating call of the Noobs.
---
God, I hope so. In fallout 4, the laser weapons were borderline worthless (excluding the assaultron head and laser musket, since they could charge to make up the damage). In 76, they‚Äôre even worse than 4 since they need to be scrapped several times just to get lucky and learn the good mods.
---
And don‚Äôt even get me started on the sniper barrel...
---
It would be cool if each vendor had a few "for trade" slots.
---
Claiming pvpers got it nerfed is revisionist history. Explosives in general and tse specifically dominated in pve and anyone without was getting lapped
---
Communism Bot awards you the Order of the Turnip!
---
A quest to be able to craft the ammo would probably be the best thing to happen to the weapon. The 76 dwellers are supposed to be the best and brightest, so why not let them understand Alien tech?
---
The end game to 76 for me is playing another game or doing something else in life because there is no end game to speak of.
---
Do people just not fucking read?
---
Weeks or months maybe.  But there's no way to know for sure.
---
Man i'm stoked for daily ops, this is what f76 needed for so long.
---
Man.  seeing this post sux.  As a guy with decent gear I want to get into the god roll area.  So I look for rare outfits and try my luck with the purveyor.  Nothing yet.  Well when i was a lev 20 I sold my VTU baseball hat to a vendor bot to get enough caps to buy some materials to make my first excavator set. Sigh.
---
knowing that god rolls are blocked from being in vendors due to cap limit just makes me sad.
---
For most weapons crit savvy is much better but shotguns are an exception because each pellet can proc four leaf clover.
---
So if you are using a shotgun, take four leaf clover.  I think with decent luck you can get away with just one point and every other hit is a crit.  For everything else take crit savvy, three points should also make every other hit be a crit.  Better criticals is inferior to either and is not usually recommended. 
---
 I'm not entirely sure if any of this is impacted by patch tomorrow tho..
---
What do you want? Some sort of "confirm trade" verification?
---
That's just crazy talk and impossible to code!!!
---
The ‚Äúbest‚Äù melee weapon is any unarmed or two handed you can get your hands on. In the current meta one handed is weaker than the other two and not as popular, not to say it can‚Äôt smack either the right build. You don‚Äôt need much to make melee viable in the current patch, however with one wasteland‚Äôs balance changes it may be necessary to ask this question again based on what goes live.
---
The best legendary rolls are generally bloodied, junkies, anti-armor, or instigating. These are flat damage perks that give you huge numbers per swing, but other effects still work. Swing speed is nice for clearing groups of squishy enemies. Power attack damage is better for those tougher enemies like mutants and larger creatures. Third star is completely personal preference, reduced weight or +1 strength are the most sought after though.
---
As far as build goes, as long as you have 15 strength and the perks for your specific weapon type you should be fine. The rest depends on where you want your health to sit. Bloodied is by far the most damage in the game, but other play styles are viable. For junkies you need intelligence and luck, for high health you need endurance and agility. Low health perks like nerd rage(intelligence), serendipity(luck), and radicool(endurance) are core. For high health a mix of sneak perks(agility) and tanky perks(endurance) are a must to keep your damage up.
---
If you know specifically what weapon type and play style you want to go with it will be a lot easier to show you examples of builds and best weapons. So a few quick questions:
---
Do you plan to play in power armor?
---
Do you want big damage or faster attack speed?
---
Do you want to be a low healthy build (20% or below)?
---
Do you want to be a junkie (addicted to chems in withdrawal)?
---
Welcome to the "almost heaven" side of WV
---
We're glad to have you. Probably not why you posted but: 
---
Guns/perks/build? [Spoiler alert im looking to help]
---
Hey buddy *friendly pat on shoulder* irregardless is not a word.  Just regardless
---
No, I did. That's why I posted the comment... smh
---
They don't understand this
---
Lets hope not, im sure they will break the game entirely with snow added lol
---
yeah like he daid try leaving the area first.  set up your tent just out side.  then leave server
---
finally use some of those skis

Or just swap ther perks in when needed and save your pp for something that you can't easily just take 30 seconds to negate entirely.
---
I'm with you man. I'm tired of the whining and complaining posts about some of this shit. The "nerf" isn't even that drastic. It sucks I guess, but whatever. Angryturtle has videos from the PTS and he's still killing things just fucking fine. 
---
I stay subbed here for the news or the good discussion that does happen, but fo76filthycasuals is a better sub for the game. Its just people playing and having fun and not pissing their pants about every little thing that happens.
---
I‚Äôm ganna so ganna make a post tomorrow  complaining about the dmg nerf and maybe rage quit... just for the sweet karma farm
---
The problem is that player vending is a caps sink and adding FTO spots would eliminate the high cap items from the vending process leaving too many caps in the economy.
---
It really is insane, I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking ü§¶
---
End game is soloing SBQ, ISS and Earle.
---
It would help if you'd tell us what are these issues you're having
---
*closes the stash*. well, shit.
---
I droped every possible blooded weapon this weekend  so I'll test
---
I actually got caught IN the shaft, after the rocks tumbled. Unable to go up or down. Had to fast-travel and fail the event. Was livid.
---
[I got one here but it's dead and not at its spawn location. Sorry if that doesn't suffice.](https://imgur.com/a/ri63JnV)
---
Tomorrow Tuesday the 15th after patch 22
---
God damn do I hate youtube videos. 15 minutes of someone talking and all I want is to just see some pictures of the items.
---
Commenting on a 2 day old post with this username. üëåüèª
---
You are not alone. In fact all of the characters that same person voices I cannot stand. So discordant.
---
Not only did it drive me crazy, my wife was ready to bash my PC to pieces because she would hear it when I was playing.
---
I got the game on launch day paid full price for centennial version. Have maybe 200 hours on the game lvl 151 only character. 
---
I play when things are fun and take long breaks inbetween. Play how you want to play its a game. I like your comment.
---
The side door is there to take the trash out, no one wants to open a giant vault door just to throw out an empty milk carton.
---
Idk why but she reminds me of Angelica from rugrats
---
If we're gonna truly refer back to then it was honestly them just being absolutely busted in all cases. PvP an PvE. You could literally one tap mobs with just the explosion an yourself. I probably killed myself 100s of times back then.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  I was considering that too.
---
Run the pvp, workshops , uninvited events , ect.  Be creative and a raider
---
The Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria...
---
&gt; It sucks to have a high lvl character and have to decide to give up or constantly swap out for repairing, hacking, crafting, whatever. 
---
Basically you don't like RPGs. One of the single most defining features of an RPG is the choices you make. Choosing one perk over another.
---
It should always be a choice as to what perks you have active on your and what not to. Otherwise what's the point of even having perk slots. Just make all perks passive so you don't need to choose at all.
---
I desperately need for there to be snow in a Fallout game, it's one of my biggest hopes for Fallout 5 or any map expansions to 76. I'm behind this 100%.
---
Dissapointment is extreme
---
Fair enough I traded in far to many "good husband" points saying give me 15 I gotta run my dailies real quick.
---
Say that now, but it 2 weeks when you have all the rewards and have done the 4 maps 1000s of times an well be right back to square one of not much to do.
---
1200 atoms and you can put snow on your roof take it or leave it
---
Id love to see this but still Nuka Cola: Its got my Blood in it is the funniest moment in the whole damn series imo
---
it is only 100... miniguns are shit
---
I have a 2080ti. It's only lagging on your machine.
---
Never mind; it got sorted shortly after you commented!
---
Many thanks anyway!
---
Umm... this feature is the single defining thing that makes stealth assaultrons more dangerous than its regular brethren. 
---
I'd like to see more of this sort of thing - like an assaultron that can always detect you regardless of your stealth. Shake things up a bit and keep them interesting.
---
If you ever get it in your head to screw me overrrrrrrrr. Shut your robot whore mouth for one day!!
---
I'm level 180. I've done all the quests and grinding. Just not looking forward to this update at all.
---
Oh I see
---
Simple solution, don‚Äôt price things at the overinflated prices that market groups demand.
---
I run a junkies heavy gunner build, my main weapon is a JE GP and I just got my hands on a BE laser rifle, now all the energy weapons (especially the heavy energy weapons like the Gatling plasma) are getting nerfed to the ground. I didn‚Äôt want to change my build and now to have my perks messed with, my main weapons nerfed into the ground I really am not looking forward to this update. Some of us worked very hard for our builds
---
I hate it because it feels like they tried too hard to make her quirky and funny and it came out annoying and cringy.
---

---
Personally I don't bother too much with trades because of the lack of barter function I do trade with the ppl I play with regularly as I have trust in them which is a shame as I have bits of gear sitting on alts as well that would suit others more. Although I do give away a bit cause of space issues usually just get to a point where I'll just turn up to a random and start dropping gear as it's less Hassel then trying to trade it to ppl.
---
Great list!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that just yet.
---
Follow through will be greatly benefiting rifles of single and auto variety, and pistols are finally earning some armor penetration. Pistols are definitely still going to be on the weaker end of weapons, but at least they can hold their own now.
---
Ahh I did the same with mineüòÜ
---
Bet he has a lot of junk for rose
---
That's the SOMO community, short for South Morgantown. They are all lovely, and they host really fun events throughout the year. They have a fb page too, have a look at some of their builds.
---
So you willingly missed the point... smart.
---
To save time and caps, because when I say I could pay some caps I don't mean all of the caps.
---
Hey buddy, I double checked and according to oxford dictionary it‚Äôs been a word since the mid 1800‚Äôs
---
Well... they buffed one weapon.
---
The alien blaster. And it wasn‚Äôt by enough for it to truly matter.
---
Tell you what. Join the datamining Discord, learn how Nuclear Winter can tell Adventure vs NW maps apart, and then I'll show you the issue with the LAYR on some of the records. The proof is there, it's just not understandable until you have some background. Fair?
---
That's exactly what I use it for, then switch it out for Hard Bargain Rank 3 when im buying/selling at the vendor bots.
---
There are lots of little tricks. Several food items with Cranberry increase xp rate temporarily. Being in a team also helps

\-Guides made by MuchkinJesse and her community
---
then i won't have that problem as they are already low lol
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this one! Does it randomly pop up like other events or is it triggered by doing something?
---
One word, POWERFIST.
---
I always look at that same moon lamp/light when I turn in my vacuum tubes and think similarly:)
---
Lol ... Man, that message from her made me consider her quests a high priority when I realized that I would always hear it until I completed it. This adding to my Camp that was being built at the same time, plus the message of overcumbed even carrying half of what my character really can handle and a pop up that opens from time to time on any fragment of a map that I must gather and that I don't even know what it is. A lot of mess on log on, because of that, I dedicated an entire afternoon to get rid of those quests of hers at least ...
---
I found this out for myself last week.  Such a time saver
---
This response is shortsighted. I don't like battle royal games if i did there are much better options than nuclear winter.I I didn't purchase Fallout Nuclear winter. 76 wasn't meant to be Fallout 5 with friends or it wouldn't have had PVP at all. 
---
In a online gaming environment there will always be griefers of some form and this game has more than adequate anti griefing measures.
---
So recently I've picked up hopping around the encounter locations in a circuit. I originally did this to boost rep grind, but I will definitely keep doing it now that I've maxed the rep. 
---
 For one thing, I found it was actually a more active and fun view of the world. You see different people/creatures interacting. 
---
There's often legendary creatures, which can supply you with star goods to keep or trade or scrip.
---
The grouping of mobs can be nice for farming. There's humanoid groups which can provide good weapon/steel/aluminium/lead/gunpowder scrap.  There's animals which can provide good batches of meat and acid (including hoards of ants, which are a nice and rare find if you make rad ant beer). 
---
There's the big boys like death claws, goat bro's, lovecraftian gulpers, cuddly sloths etc which give you a pile of goodies per kill on top of just being plain old satisfying to slaughter.
---
Long story short: it's relatively more fun, decently productive, and moderately rewarding.
---
Good pics.  I have taken a few pics of ole' Earl by going in with Chinese stealth armor.  You can get a couple good shots if you time them right after he screams.
---
Wow I never knew this, they never taught us things like this in school.
---
As someone who never left TSE (though I'm trying to go tanky with vamps), you have my curiosity.  I'll have to watch that
---
For me it's camps that have taken the time to give the place a realistic, lived in quality. Like it's the kind of place a person would build and decorate if they wanted to live in it.
---
Interesting! I‚Äôve been farming water for caps most of the game, and saving guns for scrap. You sell regular guns to get caps?
---
No doubt, my wife plays and has a main character, we use the other 8 as mules for the moment. Always have them if I want to try a different build, but I am and have always been a Power Armor Heavy Guns build...dont have much interest in PvP so never felt the need for a change. Been sitting on these perk points and card packs for so long..
---
Gonna be really nice to start using them finally.
---
Honestly I didn't play fallout until 2. I'm sure they were fun in 1 as well though.
---
You can cheese if you have marsupial, otherwise not sure. But ya, press the buttons.
---
Is it actually the same voice actor?
---
People are already whining lol
---
No, I saw the point - shush about complaining about lost score because you don't like hearing it. I just don't agree with it.
---
That‚Äôs fair! There are a few other games I want to check out, but I‚Äôm wanting to stay on FO76 for events, expansions, etc.
---
Yup, I had to check the voice actors on that one.  She even has the mane/mohawk.
---
Gotta love that Deep mule storage
---
That's my plan.  Angry Turtle pointed out this issue with the Charisma card on one of his PTR videos, and I've been planning my build assuming they would/could not fix this.
---
That sounds like an effective strategy! Sorry, this isn‚Äôt something I should know, but what‚Äôs an encounter location?
---
its definitely better for the dmg and worth repairing more often, but be careful if enemies are close to you so you wont explode yourself to death when you are trying to heal
---
I can‚Äôt wait for ‚Äúpatch 22 sucks!‚Äù
---
And then the body will only mention the damage recalculations. I‚Äôm very excited for tomorrow though
---
I would guess Better Criticals will be impacted because it is a damage modifier. But I will test it. Because if it remains multiplicative rather than additive then it might me a good option.
---
in Kelsos voice* BURN
---
I wasted caps on the communist bunker set.  It's pretty disappointing and not worth it. :(
---
Im excited to run old events and actually get rewards my level. 
---
One wasteland has been long over due. I can't wait!
---
Follow through... so I can use them past level 200? And pistols are getting a small buff but losing the legendary effects that made them barely viable pre nerf. 
---
I‚Äôm not worried about my commandos personally. Well, except my berserker. But until we get some actual rebalancing instead of just an across the board nerf I‚Äôm utterly opposed to what they are doing.
---
I plan on using my main in INT, END, LUCK b/c it's at 118.  
---
My shotgun is max STR so here I'll go INT, END, LUCK. The rest of the perks are lacking and from what I've seen from the videos from players on the PTS....a lot are lacking or aren't working right.
---
Yep. Missed the point. No real surprise there.
---
Is** something I should know
---
I've always wanted to but my charisma is only 7
---
It is a really good weapon. I was using one for ages until I scored a furious one. Funnily enough in this sale!
---
It's worth noting that the two-shot legendary effect splits the damage evenly across two projectiles, or does on my two shot explosive lever action at least (I see three floating damage numbers when I use it, two high ones from the two shot and one low one from the explosion.) I believe this has armor penetration implications since performance against armor is dependent upon damage per shot, but haven't tested it. If it does, the damage calculator you mentioned might be giving incorrect results against armor for multiple projectile weapons. I am dying to know about this lol.
---
Also when you say armor penetration has diminishing returns, it's not so much that it's coded to diminish as that it's calculated multiplicatively (which for armor penetration, unlike damage buffs, produces a lower result than additively.) Multiply (1-armor penetration) for each source of armor penetration, then multiply that by the enemy's armor rating to get the final armor rating. Armor rating is then turned into a percent damage reduction by that nonlinear equation that also looks at damage per shot. There's a bit on the wiki about the penetration from stabilized and tank killer getting cut in half if you're also running anti-armor legendary, but I don't think it's the case.
---
Learning more about the game still! Never done riding shotgun. Thank you!
---
Yeah sneak up on em at the kanawha county cemetery for a nice photo op. Got one of me kneeling with them while they all have their hands up, and there is even the big grotesque mothman corpse hanging up
---
Yh or the jetpack kinda obvious ik
---
What's reddit? ü§î
---
Uh... yeah. Level 200 unlocks the fifth slot. 300 is the sixth and final.
---
Legendary perks are available at level 50 onwards, and the slots are cross character. The coins are not, but you get 50 immediately at level 50 (or as a player who‚Äôs over it at the start of this update).
---
Yeah, that's what I do too. Milk it for what it's worth and then move on until the next decent content drop.
---
I really don't care for grinding shit out where the reward is way below the effort required to get it. If I get SS armour, awesome. If not, whatever.
---
What are Mr. Fuzzy tokens?!?
---
The price of two shot explosive weapons will be going up while the price of bloodied and junkies weapons will be rock bottom!
---
How about just a ton of ash  from Big bertha?
---
Cool.
---
Majority of fan base now? Current cash handling customers? We dont want pvp in adventure. Sorry.
---
Now should survival be brought back? Sure. Why not! The 10-20% of pvpers will know what they are doing. Teams would still be easy enough and i don't see why pvp NEEDS to be in 76 if the people most likely to support the game dont want it.
---
15 STR is melee necessity.
---
Still 8 times de chance of trigering! Shotguns shoot 8 pellets right? Or did I just make that up?
---
Please. Indulge us. What's your point?
---
RIP my explosive build. The explosive prefix was too good, so my 40mm had to die with it...
---
Yeah, clearing out that workshop area doesn't take long at all and if you clear it twice (swap servers), then you generally have the 1400 caps if you have hard bargain 3 / enough charisma. If I got time, I also claim the workshop and do the event while I'm at it for the junk. If I'm still short some caps I'll sell some purified water too cause I'd rather not do a third run of the workshop. This way I can sell my stim/radaway/serums at my player vendor for more caps per day.
---
Rip never got even close to that strong but maybe I‚Äôll be able to take Earle on soon :/
---
Thank you for taking the time for wrighting this. I really appreciate it
---
not a lot. had a high drop rate chance. I have 5 of each sitting there. You may get a K each. but i imagine someone would pay more. Also i think we're getting Meat Six Days part 2 soon. Assuming it has same rewards the price will go down even more.
---
Ranking up season 2 for more perk cards
---
I‚Äôve had someone pick up my stuff too
---
True but it is limited to energy damage. I don't use pa but I hope they keep it
---
Not true, it‚Äôll be the most affected even though it‚Äôs still most effective for damage
---
How much worse could it get than yesterday anyway, when I logged on and noticed my camp was on the edge of a blast zone. As I‚Äôm running up to it, things start exploding and half my camp is just destroyed in real time before my eyes. 
---
At that point, I figured it was a new feature with my camp looking like two face and most of my power sources and inventory machines destroyed. Luckily I was able to rebuild it after gathering a few more resources and having to build a frog jar. 
---
Pro tip - don‚Äôt keep weird things in your camp like the frog jar that require you to have obscure ingredients like blood leaf ... unless you want to go on a treasure hunt around the map trying to find one resource.
---
&gt;I for one, as a seasoned beta player with thousands upon thousands of hours with multiple optimized bloodied/junkies hybrid characters am excited.
---
I mean if you put in thousands of hours and optimizing your build completely, shouldn't you be a little op?
---
Does resist for all armor matching work with PA pieces matching?  I assume not
---
Let's not, and pretend that we did.
---
Because angry Turtle is a heavy gunner, that's his build, Heavy gunners arn't getting as hit as hard as rifleman, melee and pistol users!
---
Hmmmm
---
Oh man. It‚Äôs so much fun. Rewards are based on completion and not based off the optional, the optional objective governs the caps that drop for the event, event specific plans are for the CAMP flag and the backpack skin and there‚Äôs an event specific outfit as well. All sell fairly well in your vendor if you need some quick caps.
---
Looks like that formula P I've been saving up is going to come in handy.
---
its a little anecdotal, at least in the way he shows it, but TSE was outperforming both AAE and BE in damage on the same bloodied build. It's something to do with how explosive interacts with TS since TS by itself is horrible.
---
You've won the great Appalachian Sweep Stakes!
---
That's bizarre bc i didn't think teammates could damage you in a public event, first of all. Secondly, I've always kept my loot when I die during them. Is that not the case always??
---
Yeah, literally all I do in anymore is collect anything new they release then log out. Maybe build a new CAMP sometimes.
---
 I was working on a alt but they destroyed that with rep grinds. An the quest has been broken for months to continue the story. My main is a bloodied command not much I can do to improve on. There's only 3-4 viable events that I'm super burned out on. The update Tom will be interesting but its still not enough. Will definitely get me to grind the new rewards a bit though.
---
Not that much. Whatever you do though, don't listen to what Fed76 says about its pricing. They don't base off what people sell it for in-game so their prices are usually way off.
---
It's almost like rifles outclassing heavy guns in every aspect wasn't an intended balancing choice
---
We should get a premade response ready and just copy paste that into every post about it
---
LIES, Q ANON TOLD ME YOU'RE ACTUALLY TODD HOWARD CLONE #5738b.
---
Mhm im like lv 76
---
Ten minutes is too long. Since your loot has a quest marker on it to pick up i would say 30 sec to a minute
---
They‚Äôre releasing a patch tomorrow? 
---
(note to self: don‚Äôt try to play 76 tomorrow. Wait until all the new bugs are public) lol. 
---
(separate note to self: I‚Äôm excited to see if the game changes and what it might be like)
---
I do not know if this is the right place to ask but i had a question about the Hack and Slash Legendary perk.
---
Does this effect apply to Unarmed attacks with a Power Fist as well or is it strictly for Melee?
---
I'd rather go with Explosive Palm if it doesn't.
---
While bloodied has the biggest numerical drop, they'll be least effected as post patch they're still high mid teir and can do decent damage if they were bloodied commando or Bloodied heavy gunner!
---
Bethesda should have taken the season 1 scoreboard off the main loading screen once the season ended. I can totally see how that would be confusing for a casual player.
---
I have a jetpack just not enough FC's to fuel it
---
Considering WV gets an abundance of every season, they should really do this. I love when it snows here, it's so pretty
---
So basically you want to remove all consequences for dying. 
---
The loss of junk is one of the only "punishments" (I use that term very loosely) for dying in this game.
---
It was a display bug that only made base damage appear in the Pip-Boy, and has been fixed in later PTS updates.
---
Fuckin hell man, angry turtle is stirring up a lot of the trouble. Not intentionally, mind you, I've got nothing against the guy. But he blew up after covering the damage overflow bug/exploit and since then I've seen nothing but mindless parroting of every word he supposedly says. So many people who have no clue what they're talking about but misquoting AT because they watched 3 mins of a video so now they're experts on the game. It's his "fans" that constitute the problem group
---
I was playing with a person and we couldn‚Äôt hear each other but once we joined a PS4 party it worked 
---
Neither of us muted each other and our mics work fine
---
Ugh...the voice acting is way over the top...the fake enthusiastic punker bot ... Someone at BGS should be fired for hiring that voice actor that's how bad I hate her voice. Ear cancer all day...
---
I do not believe so,  no.
---
Is it really bingo if every slot gets filled up within a half hour?
---
Posting  complaints HERE does nothing. They would be far more effective posted to Bethesdas forum and social media.
---
Unless the idea isn't to fix the problem, it's just to piss and moan.
---
Angry turtle is a youtuber that has a video on how to maximize exp gain
---
From what I've read, all the ghouls need to be dead for the respawning to work
---
Yeah that's what I'm getting at. If their budget is calculated by their weight or similar such it might well be impossible to have one in a camp any bigger than a shack.
---
There's usually the one that spawns in sugar grove. Good way to test tankiness is to let the laser hit you and see how long you can take (without new pa core recharge)
---
That guitar sword may actually be a decent buy depending on the other effects tbh
---
They cant program the shit bro
---
Cracking open the deep mule storage with the boys
---
I heard people woth the ammo extractor glitch cant even place their camp on a world.  That is hilarious.
---
I believe it's intentional? I applied the captain cosmos paint to mine and the branches still poke through. Looks cooler imo, and it lets you know it's still the strangler underneath. But yeah seems like overlaying/clipping issues if it's not intended
---
I say that when the Deathclaw poops in the refrigerator...
---
No because you have no control of where you respawn
---
I think it is just going to open the flood gates on bugged "magic" heavy weapons builds.  I'm am excited to try it out the new perks for myself.  We're still going to be doing the same old things, just slower with more ammunition spent.
---
The tweet also doesn‚Äôt mention daily ops but we know it is coming. Legendary perks were covered in a previous ITV. Each of the past ITVs focused on a different aspect of the update. I don‚Äôt understand the concern.
---
Not only that... but clearly he says the big update contains those things he listed lol. You linked to official confirmation from Jeff lol
---
What‚Äôs in the patch? Jeff tells us. One wasteland, daily ops, legendary perks, armor ace.
---
You get them at Camden Park from some bots there. Camden Park is on the left side of the map south of Kanawha Bottling Plant. Its picture looks like a roller coaster. The bots will give you the Dailies Dross Toss, Lucky Mucker and Chow Line and completing each one will give you 3 Mr. Fuzzy tokens. You'll need 450 tokens total for the unique Mr. Fuzzy Suit and head.
---
It‚Äôs a feature not a bug, enjoy your fire plants
---
Energy weapons dominate the pvp arena which is where you'll find the most crying about this.
---
Also follow through won‚Äôt work with revolvers. Anyway, I guess we‚Äôll see.!
---
You‚Äôre damn right it‚Äôs ‚Äúalmost heaven‚Äù because I have seen very kind people, and if you want to help my name is FL TOMMY. I‚Äôll give you some supplies too
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Your a legend. Lol. Was planning on doing this exact thing. Glad you saved me from making this mistake .
---
I wasn‚Äôt on a team + my teammates wouldn‚Äôt have picked up my junk
---
I can‚Äôt recall 100% for sure but I do believe it works with power fist and other ‚Äúunarmed‚Äù weapons.
---
I mean, yes, that's definitely a problem.
---
I'm not quoting anything he said, merely just watched a video about the legendary perks and watching his gameplay, he wasn't have any problem killing max level enemies.
---
I also tried the PTS with the nerf, and while yes there's a difference, I don't think it's as big a difference as some people on this sub are making it out to be. I also think a lot of people who are worried and/or complaining about it don't have very optimized builds or just don't know what they're doing.
---
Not saying everyone, but it's just not as huge a hit as some people are making it out to be.
---
Thank you so much !
---
Stash your junk before you go out adventuring. You could still die from PvE and your loot bag get stuck someplace you can‚Äôt access. 
---
Better safe than sorry.
---
This.
---
I kept a few but they'll end up littering a train station eventually.
---
Thank you!!
---
Three major features coming! Which means at least 4.5 game breaking bugs! Who wants to take bets on what they will be?
---
Nice, I never thought of that haha
---
As a non-PA player, I always drop em in front of my vendors for those who can use em.
---
And you aren‚Äôt deeply ashamed of what else you could have done instead of wasting 3100 hours in this game?
---
Just not in a public event.
---
Can't the mods get a bot to do it?
---
Actually good point, I think they will.
---
However I'm still afraid alot of pets will die because 1 deathclaw cannot take out a group of same-level super mutants or similar.  Even now my lv 21 deathclaw sometimes gets beat up abit by groups of lv 5 spawns, and I have a couple turrets to help him out
---
Add me: egroegy
---
Ill be on in bout an hour. I will politely look and lilely refuse out of lack of need. I appreciate the offer regardless. Looking forward to helping you.
---
What's your fan kind of gun?
---
Give it a shot then and let us know how that goes.
---
I'm looking forward to commenting
---
Big if true.
---
No what i meant is when i launch the nuke and get out and come back in the ghouls are dead
---
Remember when the PTS first brought in colossal problem and people were complaining about how he's impossibly tanky and way too hard without a team? And then how two weeks later people were competing for &lt;1m solo times?
---
How about retreating and healing instead of going Rambo? Collectors down anyway, take your time, kill the enemies then repair it.
---
No need to stress it out just to die.
---
And maybe, just maybe store your junk before going in. Theres a stash box like 50m away.
---
That‚Äôs why I prefer the non-PA Jetpack. Just uses your AP.
---
Join an event team +75 % event exp and when the feed the people event pops-up at the end of it you get 5 canned stew that give a 10 % exp bonus and if you're really grinding you have a charisma card that gives additional exp when in a team
---
Did you purchase your plans with gold or did you obtain them through the vault raids? I have a friend who obtained his through the vault raids and has said he‚Äôs been able to apply skins in the past. When he gets on later, he will try it again to confirm. Thank you for the response.
---
Um....
---
When you die in a public event you don‚Äôt drop junk at all
---
Tbf the definition of irregardless according to Google is regardless so your both right? Or both wrong?
---
Buy a serum
---
You don‚Äôt drop your junk during public events
---
&gt;!the concentrated fire perk card at level 3 used to increase your vats hit chance +20% per shot with my auto rifles. This was massively reduced on the PTS!&lt;
---
The cloaked feature at least weens ppl out of vats. So I been going around actually aiming and was like oh shit I didn't realize how lazy vats made me lol
---
Being fully mutated really helps .. you can do it at level 5. angryyTurtle has a vid on you tube
---
In game design, this kind of OP ability is called "limiting design space", as in having this perk in the game limits what designers can do within the game's design constraints. For instance, as long as this perk is in the game, you can't put a boss that deals energy damage into the endgame because this perk would trivialize that encounter.
---
Good game design would demand that this perk be nerfed immediately, so I'm guessing we'll see it stick around for a long time.
---
In an attempt to help others out, I made a mule that had 15 Charisma. I was all set to share those sweet sweet lvl 5 perk cards... but that is when the realization hit me. That is a mule I'd need to unlock all those perk cards again  I can't be a lvl 20 doing that. I crawled back into my hole &amp; deleted him.
---
On top of all that, it has some pretty good rewards. I recently got an assault rifle plan from it that my level 363 character did not know yet. 0.1% drop chance from a select few events I believe, and that's one of them
---
Sorry, by teammates I meant those participating in the event with you. I thought when you enter a public event, those who are also participating are treated as teammates, as in they can't harm you or steal your loot. But i guess according to your post, that isn't the case. That's so strange
---
Well I sure as hell did. Why do think I posted this
---
I've got a few snaps at lucky hole first time I saw it was oh yeah, issue was the mothman is always bugged there so you cant kill it. Good news is a lot of the times there is a 3 star cultist
---
Animated cards don't give anymore than normal ones, they removed that. Just spam buy action boy and then scrap them.
---
Basically you want to kill many many mobs as quick as possible, the game is actually slowest and hardest before 50.  You shouldn't have to shoot them or hit them more than 3-5 times.  You don't have your full build or gear yet.  You want to find mobs you can kill quickly and efficiently.  Instigating melee weapons are amazing even if not your spec.  Glowing meat steak, yao gai, and mutant hound chops will give you +60% dmg.
---
I feel bad killing some of these cryptids.....
---
I saw a horribly underlevelled Flatwoods Monster chilling near his namesake, and almost regretted killing it in a way. 
---
They just tryin to live. Make bank. Feed their gross babies.
---
GET THEM COMMENTS OUT BEEFS!!
---
No it has nothing to do with 5 characters or 10000 characters. Saving your 1 camp per character is basically nothing. Saving your character with lets say 3 camps is exponentially more difficult. Wires, exact coords of foundations, etc. Its just not practical. Its kind of difficult to explain in laymen, but its just very difficult. It sounds like a simple idea. Sure. I get that. But its not. The item checking is simple, the very simplest. That makes 0% difference. The items are stored in the same place, with the same numeric value no matter what vendor you place down. Same with stashes and anything stored. Its the same reason you can not build a whole camp and "blueprint" everything. If you want something like changing locations with different camp designs the only way you can pull it kind of off is use like the seedy shed, or some predetermined asset. Like I said it COULD be done, I just would be astonished if it was every implemented.
---
It'll always do this if you bats and instantly shoot.
---
That‚Äôs right.
---
Right lol! Thanks for the response, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was intentional or not.
---
I went into this event after doing some grinding to collect steel and other items. My stash was pretty full. Didn‚Äôt want to miss out on Treasury notes
---
We tried on the PTS. No response.
---
Enclave or a player vendor.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we see an uptick in failures. That's a half-hour time, plus any ammo and healing items wasted. 
---
That's even without the garbage the victories usually bring. Bethesda really needs to make 3* enemies drop 3* loot, because even most of the 3* stuff is just scrip fodder.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you posted this. All I am telling you is they made it so you don‚Äôt drop junk on public events the same time they dropped the update to make fast travel to them free. It‚Äôs been like a year since you dropped junk in public events.
---
Do we know for certain that the legendary perks  will be available tomorrow?   [The most recent inside the vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview) made no mention at all about the legendary perks. This is starting to look like Colossal problem, which they included in patch 21... but it wasn't available to play until weeks after the patch dropped.
---
It really does seem that they have been more mum about the perks the closer we have gotten to the patch dropping.
---
From a player vendor. Or buy a serum recipe for like 24,000 caps from the enclave bunker and make it yourself.
---
Market subreddit can hook you up with serums.
---
Make sure to get some repair kits. There's gonna be a lot more tanking coming up. I mean there is always white knight and gunsmith and makeshift warrior and lucky break or w/e, but... Ya know. Repair kits, yeah
---
Why?  Doesn't a hazmat suit provide 0 protection?  Or does rad resist count towards armor as per the berserker effect?
---
Do you know how well it protects? Since the normal perk is % and this legendary one is straight up ?
---
Noooooo :\
---
Rose‚Äôs voice was done by my brother-in-law‚Äôs sister‚Äôs husband‚Äôs best man at his wedding‚Äôs niece‚Äôs pet wookie. And I take offense to your statement!
---
Neither because the 1 person said it wasn‚Äôt a word . Op just used it correctly in a sentence
---
I don‚Äôt play everyday or for multiple hours so I have to take advantage when I‚Äôm on
---
I have about 400 caps to my name
---
Good for you
---
I spent an afternoon running and dying. Ugh, but eventually they stopped coming. Holy crisp.
---
Yeah they spawned with me!
---
I'm gonna switch to a 15/15/7/4/15/15/15 build. It's gonna be great.
---
40% more power attack damage
---
Damage increases when suffering from addictions
---
+1 Strength
---
Damn I didn‚Äôt know that. Ok then, I got a long day tommorw.
---
Well it happened
---
I hated her voice but some of the other people I play with absolutely loved her. Yuck!
---
I‚Äôm not sure man, also I can‚Äôt come on tonight as I‚Äôm in uk, it‚Äôs 23:48 hahahah. Is tomorrow ok? Also my favourite weapon is, well I‚Äôm not sure xD
---
They typically sell privately for 200 caps. Do you have starched genes maxed?
---
I think it's really strange to grow bitter towards a video gaming community.
---
I hammer the fuck out of Campfire Tales, Stings &amp; Things and Operation Tidy. Chance of badges, a few caps, more meds/junk to sell and the quest spots have bobblehead and magazine spawns so regularly as nobody seems to roll through there much.
---
Plus they're just cheeky quick missions, one of which you can keep a supply of in your stash and virtually auto complete in seconds.
---
It‚Äôs not that bad dude lol. How many times have you tried it?
---
Vendors which is cheaper than the Enclave
---
I'm on ps4 but I appreciate it.
---
I have actually seen mention of this before, supposedly there were issues with thorn/solar armor made before wastelanders losing all their foliage. They may very well be treated as separate armor and one is configured differently
---
To actually answer the question, I got all of mine post-wastelanders with gold
---
But you don‚Äôt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è they changed that some time ago now. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to you but you don‚Äôt drop loot while the public events are active. The ones with the exclamation mark.
---
No I saw that. That's not why you want people to shut up about complaining about lost score here. You made that very clear with:
---
&gt;I hope we can band together as a community and stop posting about lost SCORE points
---
Why would we need to band together to do this?
---
&gt;What I DO know is that posting here accomplishes absolutely nothing.
---
Based on what evidence?
---
There are counter examples to your idea that complaining here does nothing. There are two relatively clear cases that just prove you wrong - player vendor/display case issue and the double interior wall "fix". Both issues kicked up a massive stink here. Both issues got Bethesda to respond quicker than they tend to for such issues. The reasons for it - people complained and people threatened Bethesda's revenue.
---
Of course though, if we stay silent over those issues like you'd suggested, because complaining won't do anything anyhow, then of course they have been fixed, right? In the timeframe that they were, right?
---
You and I both know that's BS. 
---
There is exactly one thing that Bethesda responds to above all else - the threat of lost revenue. That can only happen when you raise the issue. It happens on the official forums, it happens via support tickets but it's most effective here. Bethesda can't whitewash it like they can on their own forums or ignore it like with their support.
---
&gt;When you lose SCORE, it's gone forever, and there's nothing that you can do before or after it happens.
---
Provable lie based on the above. You can do something after it happens - push Bethesda to fix the issue and ideally threaten to pull your money until it gets fixed.
---
&gt;If you feel you have to post something anyway, post to their forum or their social media.
---
Also as above, demonstrably the least effective places to post these issues for reasons already stated - remove/silenced and ignored. Bethesda has no such jurisdiction here.
---
Read the room dude. The comments here speak volumes. You're on the losing side of this issue.
---
My favorite part will be the bloodied/junkie builds salty tears when they can no longer delete the SBQ or WC in two or three shots.
---
The topic of this post made me LOL so hard.  So thanks for that :)
---
DK but first time for me. I just didn‚Äôt want the event to fail
---
Luckily scrapping the cards is really quick, although it's easy to scrap the wrong one since there's no confirmation.
---
Or cheese season 2 and buy out a bunch of spot advancements smh lol. Gotta scrap them extra perk cards...
---
Does this also go for pump shottys?
---
this bug only happened to me once  
---
i also noticed this was really linked a lot with the NW challenge, maybe it was because i often did that one last a few hours/minutes before the reset or as the last one on the list
---
Thanks for this advice! I‚Äôll start doing this!
---
Hold on to them. Six months from now you‚Äôll get five times what you‚Äôll get now.
---
Ye, good point, either way if OMG can be added to the Oxford dictionary anything can be a word.
---
Due to them being tweaked, and changed while on the PTS I'm hopeful that they'll be part of patch 22. However I have a feeling that with the perks involving exploding enemies being available to all build types, the current sound choppiness (on OG xbox anyway) that occurs when people are using explosive miniguns and such on Earle and SBQ fights, that the perks might have to be adjusted to occur less frequently. Hopefully if that happens they'll increase the damage output slightly. Wait and see I guess
---
I‚Äôll give it a watch thank you so much!!
---
Anytime you see me my door is open.
---
How do normally play fallout? Big gun? Stealthy? Melee? Im like that lil Lanaster.
---
I [smoke] and i know things.
---
Edit: i play late on weekends so for you thats mornings i believe. Also ill introduce you to some uk fellows i know. :) im from oregon in the US.
---
I know it's not as big of a hit, I've gotten some solo elder runs in the daily ops using a quad ffr handmade rifle, non-bloodied build. No damage bonuses aside from 75% from perks, still felt more than good enough to kill level 70+ mutants quickly. Idk though, the people who are complaining either haven't actually played it or have a very different idea what playable and unplayable mean in an online game like this
---
Thank you for answering everyone's questions, including mine, so diligently.
---
This is going to add a lot of fun to my Unarmed build.
---
Something didn‚Äôt happen as you described it. Either the event was over, you weren‚Äôt in the event, or you didn‚Äôt even drop junk and it‚Äôs still in your inventory lol
---
Not even onto a chassis you're wearing?
---
Yep that would be me too. Lol. We call it my pop cap build.  It actually might be kind of fun to see a few other players suddenly struggle, like I do everyday!! üòÜ
---
I mean yeah, that seems worth it for the price. Rest of it is troll prices but that one is worth it
---
Will there be a patch to download?
---
Need to know if I need to leave my PS4 on.
---
I literally do not have the energy to argue with someone like you.
---
Thanks for this amazing advice! I‚Äôm very grateful thank you!!!
---
I sold all my extra meat week rewards for 300-500 caps each... Maybe could have got more but I'm not too fussed about it.
---
Yeah.
---
You'd think the PTS would be the place to fix this shit but we are talking about Bethesda here.
---
Thanks for trying.
---
I understand Bethesda chasing the cash cow. Survival was brutal if you didnt know what you were doing or ill equiped, no wonder server numbers were low. I'm a paying Beta player, I perordered, I pay for First. All of the survival elements are being stripped from this game. Mabey they should have introduced pacifist servers for those who wanted to play wasteland sims or give me options to host my server how I want.
---
I lol‚Äôd üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
He told me ‚ÄúI was going to attack you but nothing I could do would be as bad as your life‚Äù
---
Fact is he was right lol
---
You definitely can.  That must be a glitch.
---
I tried it about ten times. And it's the balance beam that's getting me. I cant see my feet to judge which direction to go and going on 3rd person don't help cause it cuts off at my ankles. I just don't understand why this had to be in the game twice. This is a first person shooter/rpg not a platform game.
---
You on PS4? Im near caps limit and don't mind purchasing one for community spirit.
---
I share class freak 3 b/c I have 6 mutations. If people wanna put on another tier 3 perk in luck, they can go right ahead
---
Yea my psn is the same as my reddit. It would be very much appreciated.
---
Perhaps. But since this sub doesn‚Äôt allow bartering posts, I recommend you try your luck in one that does.
---
I'll grab one and come find you
---
Maybe. You also don't have the evidence on your side either.
---
Prove me wrong but I know you can't. Evidence is on my side.
---
Hey as a bloodied user I'm fine with the coming challenge.
---
May be a silly question, and i promise I'm not trying to sound condescending, but did the event maybe end when all that happened? You said in your original post that it was near the end &amp; you were basically making a last ditch effort before time ran out. Did the timer hit 0 when the dude threw the grenade? That's the only thing I can think of, was timer was at 0 (and there is usually a slight lag before getting notification that the event ended &amp; rewards) and it just happened to be perfect (or imperfect for you) timing? ü§∑ in that case, y'all wouldn't be considered in the event anymore and normal adventure rules apply again
---
You can zoom out in 3rd person. On PS4 you hold select and pull back on stick I believe. Xbox is same thing. Not sure about pc
---
The event was probably technically over
---
IDK maybe a glitch but it happened
---
There's no bitterness, I just hold no respect for them. I've seen again and again how stupid things can be here and refuse to take anybody seriously unless there are some established credentials. Taking them seriously would be a necessary requirement for having any emotion like bitterness or anger. Aten_ra and the others who've helped with datamining/bug hunting have more than proven to be capable. There are some regulars whose names I run into all the time who actually know what they're doing. Just a stranger, not so much, it's a roll of the dice and the odds are not in their favor
---
I welcome the nerfs. I am tired of hitting the SBQ or Colossus and not getting any credit because they died too quickly.
---
I appreciate it. Do I need to get off my private server?
---
I dug the whole oeuvre. The CAMP was really nicely built and the prices felt like art.
---
But only archery ones, right? Or did I miss something?
---
Perhaps but I was pretty preoccupied
---
Level 52 Running around with a non-legendary Minigun..... already low damage. And 50 levels of building a shotgunner so not the best cards for PA with heavy gun! But hey it is really fun!
---
Thanks man that means a lot, I normally use the perfect storm, sniper rifle and the fixer, sometimes shotgun, I really like the perfect storm gun with that legendary ability. Also my favourite gun in the game might have to be that cool machine gun that has a long barrel that‚Äôs short, and has a green ammo box on it.and haha ye me too, and that would be alright to play on weekends ye that would fit well, thanks for this man. Have fun on those country roads!
---
You mean to tell me that we shouldn‚Äôt be able to kill Earl Q. Williams in 0.3 seconds?!?!?
---
Yeah I feel the 10mm SMG is really overlooked solely due to its lack of a suppressor. It spits out a lot of damage very quickly and is a very viable commando weapon. If it ever got the option for a suppressor, I think we‚Äôd see it‚Äôs usage jump dramatically in the community.
---
Which obstacle course?    
---
The easiest and closest one to get the military ID would be harder with it.    
---
I did them all before getting any mutations. If you have the caps I see them somewhat often in player vendors.
---
I get that you feel entitled. Its a business. We are all customers. I feel for you, honest. If they introduced survival without any cross element like no legendary or broken things i honestly believe youd have more "Sims" players invested. See, from what ive gathered, pvp is basically a dupers war driven by reddit market economics; not skills.
---
Hopefully the devs see me: a peace loving baffoon hoping for community rebuilding and team events ECT and you: am awesome bloodthirsty force of nature as mutually important. I certainly do. Another thought.
---
What if taking workshops started a small timer [10-15 seconds] so there wasnt so much "grief" as "gauntlet casting"? I'd love to hear from your perspective
---
ditto
---
I should be able to join it
---
Regardless, just know that you drop your loot if you die and others can pick it up.  Don't die.
---
Yeah, it's a good thing.....until three months from now when they buff the half you threw away and nerf/bug the ones you kept.
---
My god... confirmation is the single most logical thing to implement given the accidents that can happen and they don't...? It's not even that hard to code in.
---
I switched to public
---
What makes you think that?
---
well I have the fact that the problem was never fixed despite hundreds of posts about it, over the course of the entire first season. There is that little bit of evidence.
---
I have the recipe and a few made. I can hop online and grab you one quick. For the course, try not to rush it since you should have plenty of time.
---
Pro tip: if you find an ally called becket and do his questline after 50 youll get an aweaome .50 cal machine gun (the green ammo box one). Looking forward to it brother!
---
Absolutely.  
---
My heavy gunner has an instigating explosive gatling, and most mobs I kill in two shots now.
---
Have two bloodied characters and yeah, everything dies immediately. 
---
Have a melee junkies. 
---
And my last toon is just for fun and hes gonna be a chainsaw build because it's fun.
---
I get that some people are bummed to be doing less damage, but i feel like the majority of players aren't going to notice a drastic difference. Might take a few extra bullets to kill mobs but oh well. Not like ammo is hard to get, especially with the legendary ammo perk.
---
Sorry if I'm rambling, im kinda buzzed and you know.. just get tired of the complaining on this sub sometimes.
---
If you mean on the weapons inventory description, I'm fairly certain that's only based on perks/chems/weapon mods/misc equipment modifiers, and the magic only happens when you hit an enemy. 
---
In other words the weapons stats don't reflect the additional 'two shot' damage or 'explosive damage' or 'armor piercing'...  etc damage.
---
WE DID IT!!
---
Someone is giving me one how long do they last?
---
Unlimited caps would be bad though. The value of caps would fall significantly and almost all trading would have to be done without caps.
---
That‚Äôs amazing I didn‚Äôt know! Thanks so much bro!
---
I was trying to find this TSE video you're referencing, but cannot. Do you have a link?
---
What about "people still play this game?!?11?!1?"
---
I spent 30 minutes on launching 1 and right before he died I lost power.
---
I hate buying 3 ammo from a random,just a waste of my time,my caps and it's not fun or challenging at all.
---
I can breeze through any challenge.
---
Anytime! Ill start stockpiling some fun optuons for you this week (my endgame is equipping homies to become deathbringers)
---
When somebody has to take a dump really bad, they ain't waiting for no vault door to open for the "Suffering from Dysentery" message to pop up
---
Sharing some nukashine with ya peeps before we have to hunker down
---
I LOVE ROSE.  The voice goes great with her type of psychotic
---
I was nuked by a second nuke while fighting the queen. Someone double nuke sbq... by accident? I dun know
---
&gt;bloodied and junkies weapons will be rock bottom!
---
Doubt it. Bloodied will still have the (second?) highest damage and it has pretty overpowered aspects such as unyielding armor and the serendipity perk. They could cut the max damage bonus from bloodied down to 50% with the new damage calculation and people would still be reluctant to switch away from it. If anything the "Fundy duds" legendary perk may just make them more devoted than before since just one rank of that makes the biggest enemy of bloodied builds (poison damage) near negligible.
---
As for Junkie's, I expect Anti-Armor weapons will either go for around the same price or slightly higher. Prices for Junkie's weapons will not change much. In my opinion the damage changes makes AA a competitive effect for Junkie's, but it doesn't completely invalidate it.
---
Not sure if TSE weapons will keep the seemingly giant damage buffs they got since it sounds like the way explosive is working with two shot is a bug that could be fixed within a few months. Also two shot still gives weapons crap accuracy.
---
But rifles never outclassed heavy guns! They were good at one shotting normal mook enemies but both commando and heavy gunner could do the same thing anyway!
---
Rifleman perks were awful for bosses!
---
Yea about half of them will be dead at first
---
But what if you play with a controller on PC?
---
Just do it, it's not hard
---
Hmmm...interesting and convenient.
---
This^
---
If you have a level 2 "starched genes", then forever. You can only lose it if you don't have the perk equipped and you use radaway or the decontamination showers.
---
edit: the only special things about serums is that you get exactly what you want and for the hour after using it, the negative effects are suppressed.
---
Yea i do alot of treasure maps so i just jump camps with misc. items.  I think that challenge was part of the we have no way to fix the lost score but so here is a freebie
---
Step into the empty frame and equip the single armor parts through pipboy
---
All good, my mic is fucked i need a new one. So sorry not being an ignorant ass
---
In the current PTS tests bloodied explosive is doing less damage than two shot explosive.
---
Bloodied is still great but it's mid teir on the tests now.
---
The 30% increase?  That‚Äôs cute.
---
I hope it doesn't mean that it'll take 50 hits to kill something with a super sledge instead of 20. That poor thing breaks every 2 days as it is.
---
edit: It broke during my first event of the day. Fuck this change.
---
Well you ever see any aliens walking around?  There is a reason for that.  Cant invade if your weapons do dick to the planets inhabitants.
---
It's all good
---
This might sound silly but I‚Äôve never seen it posted, if you find the safe/computer combo, pick the lock and hack the computer, also spamming food cooking, boiling water. Check your challenge‚Äôs some are easy to complete if you focus on them, also any event that kicks of click it see if anyone has joined, if they have people in them then join do your best to help &amp; you‚Äôll get xp
---
yes a big one
---
Unfortunately magic weapons are not fixed so it will only make the problem worse
---
That is an amazing end game idea, mine is to do the same, but to get other to help others and to get them to help others, start a cycle, on Xbox I used to have a small camp village made with some guys, but they started idling and stopped playing after awhile, so I stopped making the camp town thing, miss them guys but they never come on Xbox anymore so I sold it don‚Äôt even know where they are anymore. So off topic sorry hahahaah. But that is a great endgame my friend!
---
For me it would be running out of 5.56
---
You might not be as nerfed as you think. The "nerf" is just a recalculation of damage stats from multiplicative to additive. If you weren't already using maxed gear and drugs/food etc you will see a much milder nerf.
---
Don't use radaway though, it might take it off. Other than that it's permanent, when you can I recommend getting starched genes,then you can use radaway without a chance of losing the mutations
---
That's not entirely true. Bethesda did try something. Very lazy low effort somethings but they did. 
---
Added 1-2 extra daily challenges. We started out with exactly 5 dailies to coincide with the golden daily challenge bonus reward (plus NW one) and then we got 1-2 more over that so you didn't need to do all of them.
---
Added more double score/extra challenge event periods than was previously announced and even finished off with an unplanned double score for the final week.
---
It's by no means an adequate solution and it's bothersome how lazy Bethesda was to try and address the issue but to say that complaining had no impact is provably false in this case.
---
Like I said, the evidence is not on your side.
---
Thanks for playing. Better luck next time.
---
Well said. Considering enemies are finally scaling up your level hopefully it won‚Äôt be that bad for casual/new players but one can only hope.
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll start doing this!!
---
When you have more than you need ill bet youll end up doing the same. 55 more work minutes then the real grind begins :D pleasure chatting mate. Talk soon
---
You 100 percent can build it on another chassis on PC.  All of the t65 I currently use was built on a custom named chassis and then transferred over.  There is some weird bug though where I couldn't slap it onto the chassis itself using the transfer menu and had to put it into my inventory, get inside the frame and then equip it like regular armor.
---
Kind of dumb, but from what I remember I needed to do it that way.  Pretty sure it's meant to stop someone who hasn't bought the plans from dropping it and then having a friend load it up with parts before they collect it again.
---
Also, how the hell does anyone solo the endgame bosses? Why COMPLAIN when you've finally achieved peak performance?
---
Not everyone wants to dedicate their life to this game. Can I please enjoy it casually?
---
You too man, have a good evening/day :D
---
Feel crappy for the people who had someone else place it in their camp without their consent.
---
Also added you on ps4^
---
I hope you fixed the ounce of prevention quest issue.
---
As a semi lone wanderer since BETA i say
---
"What damage nerfs??"  
---
Ive been slappin fools for so long w/o god rolls and legacy or magic weapons for so long even Rosie thinks my mind is gone.
---
I rolled up to SBQs in nuke zones with a hazmat suit and *lost* until i won.
---
 Bring it on...i havent played in 3 weeks since i finished the season and fought and melted earl twice.
---
I want a real challenge.
---
I have been clearing daily ops with all heavy energy weapon types without a problem, it did not seem like a substantial nerf.
---
I cant hit those bugs at all with any gun. Lol always melee.
---
Two mains , one commando and one heavy :-)
---
Was at a camp yesterday and the collectron bot said it thinks about burning this camp down sometimes
---
Wish we could get an outfit variation of the guy on the right
---
https://youtu.be/9EeNcV7OxZU
---
Add FemaleFury79 I‚Äôm happy to donate whatever I can come by my camp anytime I‚Äôm always on
---
Not an option when you have played mainly only one and collected every plan etc for that one character :) Although that would be the easiest and logical solution. Also, my alts are really low for my taste. Between 100-150.
---
Here's my bets:
---
* Fast Travel is impossible, it says you are overenumbered even when carrying nothing. Doesn't get fixed until Patch 29.
---
* A new dupe glitch involving chicken coops. It won't be known for a week when Demon Asylum makes a video and causes all chicken coops to be disabled.
---
* Legendary Ammo perk card actually makes less ammo than it says, and increases the materials used. Bethesda claims it's "working as intended", never fixed.
---
* Daily Ops will be able to completed at Elder level multiple times a day, instead of once. Since this is helpful to the player, they will be disabled for 2 weeks.
---
* Stuck in power armor glitch returns. Bethesda says they can't fix it without rolling back entire update.
---
There is a difference between giving us the chance for extra points and fixing the issue causing the points to go away in the first place. Given your history in this conversation, it's not surprising that you skipped over pertinent facts.
---
But you're also someone who thinks the length of a response is a measure of how intelligent it is, which is further evidence that I have wasted my time completely having this conversation in the first place.
---
*Why big number no more big number?*
---
It‚Äôll be interesting to see your perk load out with that.
---
Anything's possible, but I really, really, really, really doubt they're gonna put this off more. Everything was working more or less fine. Except for the Exploding perks, but no one is going to take those anyway.
---
What do you mean by this?
---
So she can dual wield but I can‚Äôt? What does she have that I don‚Äôt üëøüëø
---
I have that same issue when I play with my brother. We always just did party because we could never figure it out.
---
I've been away for a few months, why is everything different? Lol
---
Just trying go to help. It‚Äôs a big change that impacts so much.
---
Any major "buffs" would render this useless.
---
the wasteland got a tad more difficult for the most OP players?
---
boohoo
---
Hahaha holy shit. You know its a good update when people are literally comparing it to dying.
---
The update doesn't drop until tomorrow yes that's correct
---
With the damage nerf coming, maybe, tomorrow and if it is the same as the PTS, TSE's with maxed demolition expert will be back on top again. Well top of the bottom.  Way above the rest will be Legacy at number one and magic weapons being considerably behind at number 2. Magic doesn't always trigger and requires specific circumstances to trigger.  angryyTurtle has several great videos magic ledgendary effects.
---
Correct. But it‚Äôs something. What additional perks do you have in mind?
---
Yeah, my I EX gatling has been my go to for daily ops if only because when I want to finish fast for my elder run I can't be bothered to loot, and it is very effective.
---
Since beta actually. As much dumb shit as they have done, making the game unplayable to this degree would only make sense if they wanted to kill off the playerbase.
---
??? Yes you do. You choose to spawn at the closest location near your death then sprint towards your loot bag. Spawning for me doesn't take 30 seconds if it does for you that sucks. A minute minimum then but really if there is no penalty for death in an mmo I don't see the point of having death at all. That penalty is the chance of losing your junk which is honestly hardly a penalty at all
---
Maybe my game just glitched and deleted itselfüòÇ, honestly wouldn't be the first time something like this happened to me.
---
Your family is now &gt;!CUT CONTENT!&lt;
---
I'm actually agreeing with you. In fact, i made a new character, which i don't usually do, cause, even though i don't have a legacy of my own, i still one hit or help demolish the boss events with ease ( i can't one shot the SBQ or Earle like so many that started in beta) I thought when the Colossal Event came out, it would be a harder boss to fight, but he feels weaker then the SBQ, for some reason. This way, it feels more of a challenge and hopefully, we'll all benefit more from the side quests and dailies too, cause, like you said, it's getting stale once you go through all the main quests.
---
How many GB?
---
I think angry turtle has test videos about those exploding perks. Go look that up.
---
I don't know; I was just merely commenting that they haven't added any perks (save the archery ones) to the game so my hope is not high that they will be adding additional legendary perks.
---
If you can‚Äôt explain it laymen‚Äôs terms then do you really know what you‚Äôre talking about?
---
When the update out?
---
My favorite part will be seeing people still asking 30k or even real life $$$ for God roll guns. I have a feeling the used market will tank until a new meta arrives.
---
The one thing I hate most about this game is that you can't kill most npcs.
---
In past Fallouts if someone talked shit I would turn them into ground beef after I finished their relevant quests. Mods that turned off essential NPCs were mandatory for me.
---
Something between 1 and 100Gb
---
Bloodied/Junkie builds don't 1-2 shot SBQ though.. You've obviously mistaken legitimate buffs with Magic Limb damage and Hacked in weapons. Which is all fine and dandy, but the fact is it takes at least a full clip unless using Melee (In which case it still isn't dead in 1-2 shots). 
---
The adjustment on damage calculations is nice and I myself am looking forward to it since things like packs of ghouls etc might actually seem more freakish. 
---
But you've also got to remember, when Legacy/Magic and Hacked in weapons are still 1 shotting all your bosses that you've been working to spawn VIA nuking the areas, don't complain ;)
---
Cry me a River Dr Game Theory. 
---
Making a boss fight a low resource cost/near guaranteed high reward situation may be the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
---
Do you like what you‚Äôre trading for? How much do you use the item you‚Äôre giving up? Will you miss it? Those are the important questions you need to answer. They are digital items and their true ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is how much you‚Äôll enjoy it.
---
Closest thing to shooting fish in a barrel I've ever seen lol
---
Yup I got the game on launch and have about 300 hours at level 160. I only play when it's fun, right now I find myself bored of all the usual events and not knowing what to do, so I knew it was time for a break. Tomorrow I'll start playing again
---
Honestly that was me irl when I realized I was spawned inside the silo!
---
For our own sue, but I want one to play the game from my stash for visiting players!
---
Effective is not the same as "kills everything in 3 shots or less"
---
Just looking forward to killing everything at max level and legendary perks...can care less about any nerf when I'll have ammo factory maxed day one.
---
&gt; There is a difference between giving us the chance for extra points and fixing the issue causing the points to go away in the first place. 
---
Yeah. I know. They didn't actually fix the problem but they responded to the complaints - the whole point we're talking about here...
---
&gt; Given your history in this conversation, it's not surprising that you skipped over pertinent facts. 
---
This is rather rich coming from someone who claimed that I'm the one that missed the point. Hypocrisy much?
---
I think we're done here.
---
Like I said, thanks for playing. Better luck next time.
---
I'm going with the special ones. I can use a mule to produce ammo and the rest are more or less fine at level 1.
---
and I don't know about the TSE 'buff'. they're clearly outperforming everything by a huge margin. something's up and it could be patched at any moment.
---
Ah min max'ers
---
The worst type of gamers ever. Video or Table top.
---
Hold on, is One Wasteland coming out tomorrow? Are the damage recalculations part of that update?
---
Because if so, man, I really let myself go when it comes to news about this game.
---
That‚Äôs rough!
---
With the damage nerf it doubles back up to 10 dw
---
Just use a Black powder rifle and reload it whilst switching to a flamethrower, 300 round Black powder rifle? Don't mind if I do! Who needs a damage nerf when you have Glitches, Magic limb damage and Hacked in weapons 8-)
---
It says ranged weapon sneak attacks, so it should. It‚Äôs good for I think... 10-30 seconds, so it‚Äôll help somewhat.
---
Taking one for the team will also help.
---
Is that a threat?!
---
Isn't this dropping tomorrow?
---
I only use my power armor for nukes or if I'm overweight so playing in power armor is unlikely. I would like to have higher damage or faster attack (whichever is better) with higher health if that's possible.  I've never known how to use chems efficiently so a junkie wouldn't work well for me
---
The only time a faster fire rate black powder rifle makes sense.
---
Came here to say this. ü§£üòÇü§£
---
Yeah, even after playing for months I sometimes feel like I'm shooting nerd darts at people in body armor, I just feel like there's a spike in enemy damage and health that if you don't build for you hit a dead end. Maybe it's because of me being bad or not being good at building builds, but I feel like the difficulty of the game needs a big rebalance so hopefully this is a start of that
---
Watch a TYR or captinoob on you tube fight the SBQ and you will see the min max build.  Be sure to watch them dispatch Earle in 0.3 seconds üòÅ
---
I dunno, i'ma toy with things. It'll be fun to experiment imo.
---
Where is there an untarnished coffee pot? I don‚Äôt remember seeing that one.
---
0.1 Milisecond Earle run boisss!!!!
---
Different characters, different playstyles. Made no sense burning levels to keep switching, even well before the announcement of perk coins.
---
I get the problem with having to redo everything over again but alts are alts for a reason - they're not the main where you put all the focus in with learning plans. They're for alternate play styles for you to keep things interesting or have a change of pace when you feel up for it.
---
I don't bother going all-in with learning plans and such. Just enough to get by and nothing further.
---
I want to shoot her I've always wanted to shoot her I want to rip out whatever part of the miss nanny is the brain and throw into into a fissure site
---
I PVE too I'm not bloodthirsty. Im the nicest raider you'll ever meet. I actively hunt workshop griefers when the grind gets stale. I do have duped equipment through no wrong doing of my own. I PVP in Power Armor with weapons RNG blessed me with. I don't feel like I'm entitled to want open world pvp in a game sold as such. 
---
Its not entitled wanting the same game I've put so much time into, while watching it slowly get watered down cause someone looses some scrap/caps and gets salty.  There are plenty of places to farm scrap very few to PVP.
---
Unyielding is still good at 40% health running explosive junkies shotgun. Well, one piece autostim and the rest unyielding. I'm not always using psycho or whathaveya, so the extra special stats help counter the negatives from addictions. Ntm all the mutations (starched genes, class freak max) I have for bloodied have usefulness for nonbloodied as well. Herbivore for ap/hp regens, herd mentality and empath, things that wouldnt seem that beneficial happen to be
---
Same here, I just kind of defaulted into a bloodied melee and then blooded rifle builds because i got a few decent ones early on. Then there wasn't really incentive to try anything new. 
---
So I'm looking forward to it.
---
Only advice- none of these decisions should be made whilst blind drunk.
---
I plan to abstain for atleast ten minutes to select my legendary perks.
---
And a lot more difficult for players not min maxing?
---
I've heard if you got your strangler heart with gold bullion you will ( may ) encounter this bug. If you got it earlier from the vault raids you don't.
---
I have an earlier set and changed the skin a couple of days ago and had no problem.
---
NP man, glad to help
---
I remember seeing a video saying they were towards the bottom of the list instead of with the other mods. Just can't remember if it was on PTS.
---
Unlimited is never happening but do agree that cap cap should be higher given all the inflation we've had with this game.
---
It'd be nice if Bethesda did something about the inflation issue too but one battle at a time.
---
Everyone else: What happened to our damage!?
---
Me, a stealth archer build: hah. My damage already sucked!
---
Sorry if this sounds harsh I do not mean it to but in my opinion I love being able to solo stuff but if you don‚Äôt like high damage then stop using high damage builds or start making less quote on quote ‚Äúviable‚Äù builds but like I said that‚Äôs my opinion
---
That was my first thought as well, even the mannerisms are there.
---
That‚Äôs my cat IRL damn straight he‚Äôs immortal lol he was added in the game as an ¬´¬†Easter egg¬†¬ª for me
---
MAKE IT STOP!!
---
but seriously though I'm at a part in the quest line where every time I log in that voice-over dialogue starts. Drives me nuts. I keep meaning to finish it but I keep getting sidetracked
---
Complaining in the majority of this sub
---
I dont min max...i have a balanced build...level 400
---
No bloodied no unyielding. Short on mats...if i posted my build/weapons id be laughed at
---
But i can handle anything in the wasteland by myself and not feel like im wasting my time going anywhere on the map 
---
Im down...about time. 
---
I run iron fist 3 with an instigating MMG with a furious DCG as backup and a non god tier handmade.
---
Lets go
---
All the time. Best one was a wendigo boss in a mission that took me to some bivouac; standing there in idle mode, not aggroing, not reacting when shot, nothing. Walked right past him, grabbed the macguffin, and walked back out.
---
It's a bug. What you're seeing there is normal.
---
This. The TL;DR for it is not much. All those explosive perks aside from Hack and Slash are useless.
---
I believe nothing until it happens after update tomorrow.
---
I still have the very last one I got from last year, I've been saving it idk what for
---
just to update on this since its upvoted.   this does not work. i've tested this myself.
---
I have a base by the whitespring golf club and occasionally the ghouls will spawn headless and immune to my damage if Ive killed my spawned creatures recently on a previous server
---
I hope new pets will be upgraded as well.like finding tameable lvl 91 claws.
---
I think Player B is getting the better deal. I am biased though; I don't have any legacies and would trade anything to get one.
---
In the past I swapped characters when I got bored. Now with my level 495 I‚Äôm taking 4 specials to max so I can run heavy gunner/unarmed/melee/commando/PA all on the same character. Just need to swap strength/agility cards every now and then for the most damage. Follow through and taking one for the team will be the last two perks.
---
All maxed damage for all builds. I can‚Äôt wait.
---
As a Bloodied Stealth Commando, currently swapping to Bloodied Stealth Unarmed, I couldn't care less. I've tested the damage difference, and it's entirely ok. We do less damage across the board, but it's still easy to clap cheeks. 1-2 shotting is still a thing with the right setup ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Edited for less Shitting, more Shooting.
---
They are nerfing damage itself basically what they are doing is they are changing the way damage is calculated to make it so everything is weaker bloodied is hit the hardest yes but it‚Äôs still by far the highest damage
---
Awesome share, I am in a similar boat üö¢ as you aswell, thousands of hours put into this game, I am curious how things will evolve after tomorrow, mind you I am open minded. As per being able to share your opinion on here, I find that there are way too many not ready for that, including some of the fokes from Bethesda, I find that this community is awesome, but some still can't separate constructive criticism, from the reality of this game at times. With no pun intended. At the end of the day we are like a second, or third family when it comes to this game and community.
---
Maybe its for those duped legacies
---
Personally I‚Äôd trade for a legacy gun I would use
---
So a flat reduction to damage across all weapons?
---
Edit: also any chance of sauce? XD
---
I'll find out tomorrow. I'm not fully specced into any build. I have three 2* rifleman card but my perception is only 7. I have 15 strength but Im not fully specced into heavy gun or melee. I have just 1 unarmed melee card on an it's for anti armor. I'm not interested in full damage builds. A healthy flow of damage, item reduction, survival, and food consumption is my personal preference. In world boss events I'll switch out about 5 or 6 cards to increase my damage and put on full unyielding ss armor. Outside of that though I use wwr ss armor set, with 2 pieces being life saving so I can self revive myself 75% of the time.
---
"use a mule to produce ammo" - exactly the same with me.
---
Thats the thing. We don't know yet. Infuriating situation. What is intended and what is not, bugged or not... My first reaction was also that the whole TSE thing can't be right. I don't want to make choices now and then only to find that those choices were based on bugs or unintended effects in the calculations.
---
I think i just answered myself.. I just wait with the coins.
---
Fuel, 45, 556, 5mm, .308
---
They all fly off the shelf. I know fuel seems wierd but there's a demand
---
.45, 5.56, .50, 5mm they usually sell pretty well
---
I travel a lot around wasteland looking for bargains and I‚Äôve seen quite a lot of nice and exotic camps, e.g. round walls, swimming resorts, ufo themed discs and etc. But a couple of days ago near the Golf Club I came across a camp I will never forget...
---
It was the best military base I‚Äôve ever seen. It had a fence all around and 4 bunkers but what amazed me was how everything was well organised. Lots of military supply themed shelves all of which were filled. The owner put so much effort to make the camp look like a not a camp but a best in game location. The camp even had a command centre inside of the bunkers, weapon locker room, tents as barracks for personnel, great cooking area. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt remember all details and what pisses me the most is that I didn‚Äôt take any pictures. I even wanted to message the owner to compliment him on his truly brilliant camp but I felt lazy and just went to farm ghouls then. This was on PS4 and if the owner will notice it please post it here. I would say the camp is 10 times better designed and organised than all other amazing camps people post here.
---
A search engine that no one uses.
---
.45, .556, .50, 5mm, and fusion cells
---
During an active event, no one can kill you afaik. You can't even provoke people to pvp in an active, non monster mash event.
---
The grenade didn't kill you. And like others are saying  if you dropped junk, it means the event was over.
---
I'm planning on waiting until 23 to do anything, honestly, mostly because I'm not confident that the perks are in their final, balanced, and bug-free form yet. And as noted, there is no "undo" here.
---
I'm leaning toward the utility perks, primarily the ammo one and the lockpick/hacking one. The rest will likely be SPECIALs.
---
Edit: I play primarily stealth commando and dabble in PA/heavy on the side, fwiw.
---
*chest mod
---
This is it for me. The voice itself I don't mind but the things they make her say and the inflection she uses are very cringey.
---
Hmmm.... A "multi-spec" build. Never thought of that. I have to try out some builds on the planner.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOIS, HE DID IT!
---
To: beefytrout from: egg. I mothafuckin got you
---
Ohh I‚Äôve done that as well. My nw character is actually a mutants build, it‚Äôs fun but I‚Äôm also competitive and like beating my personal bests as in ‚Äúhow fast can I solo this‚Äù also I like playing with casual/newer players. Showing them the ropes and helping them farm the queen where they normally would struggle and not have the resources to kill her over and over again
---
Fuel, 50cal, Plasma Cores, 5.56, 2mm, 5mm, and Fusion cells.
---
Everything is 1 cap except Plasma Cores at 10. Generally try to keep at least 1k of all but plasma in stock.
---
.308 sells pretty well too, I have my camp in a low level area and stock a few lvl 5-10 Recon Rifles for a few caps each for new players. They sell like hotcakes.
---
yeah, pretty much. I want to respec my build too but I'll wait a bit, at least until we're clear on the TSE situation.
---
however long that will be.
---
I knowwww I‚Äôm upset that my stealth bow build is gonna take a hard hit as well
---
Yea maybe so :D Starting to think i will sit on the coins for a week or two and see how the patch plays itself out.
---
Tomorrow
---
The market for Glitched in weapons such as TSE 50 cals that shoot 40 mini nukes at one time will boom. 
---
Automatic Laser rifles that sound like Alien blasters and do over 10k damage a shot to SBQ will boom.
---
The reload glitch to put 300 rounds into a Bloodied 50% crit damage Black powdered rifle will be more popular
---
Abuse of the Limb damage glitch will become more popular. 
---
The realistic fact of the matter is that Bethesda really should have put in the time to find any values which were not vanilla and remove them completely before doing this. 
---
In the same sense I do like the idea of the calculation change as it actually does make it easier for Bethesda to adjust values, and possibly introduce 4-5 star legendaries in the future with less repercussions.
---
If you think I'm shitting about the hacked in weapons too, just go to [Odealo.com](https://Odealo.com) and have a browse, makes me sick to my stomach that they exist, there's a lot of legitimate weapons but there's also a LOT of (Literally self admitted by the sellers) hacked in weapons.
---
Mire is most atmosphere location for camp
---
This... this should be the comment. Zero context. Just "GET THEM COMMENTS OUT BEEFS!!"
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!
---
I feel like all the chems I pop should make my character scream back!
---
This is a useful map:
---
https://www.map76.com/acti/retriggerassaultacti0002e507
---
There are random encounters all over the map. Sometimes its baddies attacking settlers/raiders. Sometimes is a pack of ants ganging up on a death claw. If you happen to be grinding rep it could be a *slight* but helpful boost.
---
I you suggest checking them all out once or twice to get a taste of what you'll find.  It's a little different each time but there are trends you'll notice. You hit a few/all of them up, then server hop and try again.
---
I played this game a lot, since beta, it'll be very interesting to see what happens. I'm all for it. Needs something fresh I suppose.
---
Guess we will see!
---
Fucking love her voice
---
Yeah I was playing with some builds and realized with legendary specials you don‚Äôt need to compromise.  15 strength, perception, agility, and luck while still keeping 12 in intelligence for PA usage.
---
Don‚Äôt care at all about endurance or charisma, but that many points in those other 5 categories gives you a ton of options.
---
Nice, thank you for that name.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve never had a good bloodied weapon so doesn‚Äôt matter. My ghoul slayer fixer works well enough
---
I think it lags enough with the engine. No snow. You seen how the subway car operates right.
---
For sure.
---
The problem is that any weapons that do multi hits or hit multiple targets break at light speed because for some reason Austin made durability based on total hits instead of shots fired. Use an explosive weapon logically and you will see that durability drop fast.
---
Some theorize that that change isn‚Äôt intentional
---
I am IRL Cheswick‚Äôs mom :P My level designer friend put him in the game for me, as well as me as ¬´¬†puppet face¬†¬ª in the note
---
I appreciate the acknowledgment of the casual players like me. Im married, work in a hospital and am starting nursing school so i don't have a lot of time to game. Hell I'm only level 100 and due to most of my friends also being medical workers or in the military I usually play solo. I feel like bethesda doesn't give a shit about solo or casual players in regards to the nerf. I dont inderstand why its such a  problem to the devs for me to play solo and not dedicate every hour of my existence to become high leveled in their game. I dont think the nerf is fair especially when the legendary spawns have been dwindled down, the legendary rng is trash, theres a limit on scrip and bullion and the earn to cost ratio of bullion and scrip is absolute bullshit.
---
I'm all for whatever keeps this game going. I just want the option to play how I want to play not how the majority wants me to play. It comes down to profits in Bethesda's eyes and their known to pull content rather than fix it.
---
There was talk on PTS forums, and i was personally hoping that they would give us full respec. Reset all the perks and level ups, since this is a major change to the whole perk system.
---
For me "burning levels to keep switching" was the perfect solution at the time. There was nothing else to do with the level ups. I still have 130 levups unused. And maybe 20 perk card packs.
---
Im kinda worried but not as much as i would be if i was a bloodied build. Im just a furious melee build.
---
5.56, 45, 308 definitely
---
Too true. If you ever want to do a custom scrimmage I'd be down. I hate legacy spamming but i love the idea of fallout pvp.
---
Have they addressed anything about the weapons which are actually impacting the player base negatively yet? IE: Hacked in weapons, Limb damage magic, Reload Glitch? (I could literally put 300 rounds into my Bloodied 50% crit damage Black Powder Rifle and it'll take Earle down in less than 3 seconds).
---
It's less about it being changed and more that it wasn't changed along with everything else. And to think until now TSE was a bad trait due to how severely it got nerfed before.
---
I dont understand it either because energy weapons are no where near OP. The devs just nerf random shit and seem to never listen to what we actually want.
---
Man if it was unlimited....all the original day 1 players would be absolutely filthy rich from all the dupe glitches and Xmas presents would be worth so much again.
---
This is random encounter. As far as I am aware, Sheepsquatch doesn't respawn, only his howl from ''playback''. What is the point of it? I have no idea.
---
You have just related the number one reason I love mods. Being able to make the water look awesome or introduce 4 seasons into the game is all very nice, As is making your favourite character hot / deadly whatever is great BUT being able to shut things up is the pinnacle. Making generators quiet. Make one or more NPCs mute? heaven!
---
Gat. Dunno its other effects but it's a three star Gatling gun with explosive, and you're right, it's just a brilliantly fun weapon to use
---
No one buy ammo from me even though it‚Äôs popular and 1 cap. Ever since people did the ammo exploit it‚Äôs in the gutter
---
Of course I get a bunch of bloodied weapons the day before they‚Äôre nerfed.
---
Lever action  or Gauss rifle,  instigating junkies anti armor or two shot
---
same thing happened to my roommate, just have to keep trying. annoying for sure.
---
Snowball fight public event!
---
I'm really excited for this, it's the first major patch I've really been active for when it's dropped. I started at wastelanders and took a break around acp but have been really enjoying the game recently and I'm avidly awaiting this new content. Daily ops look v cool and legendary perks seem vv cool.
---
That's the thing though, workshops are PvP and almost nobody uses them for PvP the majority of the PvP that happens there are PvP players killing PvE. It's why Hunter\\Hunted radio station never gets used, there are not enough PvP players to make workshops worth being PvP locations.   
---
Survival mode solved all of this but Bethesda messed it up by giving unnecessary incentive to it. The extra exp and unique legendary weapons made PvE players feel like the had to play it, this led to angry PvE players which led to changes like the damage cap. All of which led to less and less players playing survival, then it got removed.   
---
PvP and PvE need to be separate from each other if either wants to survive. PvP needs to be its own and only reward, outside of things that only effect PvP or can be earned in PvE. This is why I thought a PvP daily op that rewards the same rewards as the PvE one would be a good idea and yet the suggestion is down voted. The only thing i can draw from this is PvP players just want to kill PvE players and don't actually want fair PvP, while PvE players have been so annoyed by it they want PvP removed completely.   
---
At this rate the only PvP that will be left is NW, which apparently isn't enough for PvP players.
---
40-50k caps max
---
Might sound dumb, but why not do both? I have only one character. Been playing since launch. Finally hit level 500 , two days ago. I switch between a heavy gunner in power armor, to a commando in all mutants powered sentinel scout armor. Yes, mutants isn‚Äôt the best, but I find this Armor does Just fine while I grind for ss Armor I actually want. Regardless of my armor, I switch between these two every day. 13 strength, 15 perception, 3 endurance, 4 charisma, 10 intelligence, 3 agility and 8 luck. Guessing your dilemma is agility. Since you said sneak ... I‚Äôm guessing you have more than 3 points in agility. I don‚Äôt. But.... if what I saw angry turtle talking about regarding legendary perks, there is a legendary perk in agility, that will allow you to use more/another perk card at max rank. Without actually having those points in agility. Might be wrong, but I think that‚Äôs what he said/showed. If that‚Äôs the case, you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem.
---
Hopefully they add a better respec system to the game one day, that will include legendary perks.
---
Not sure if there is a right or wrong response to this post. 
---
Seems like it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúcry now or cry-o-later‚Äù situation ü§™
---
I don't think they will bring them yet. They may be released along with C.A.M.P shelters which are supposed to be released this winter.
---
I don't doubt it at all. im level 400 and have been around since BETA. There are way way more magic and legacy dupes around than anyone loves to admit.
---
I personally know an entire guild walking around with TSE auto laser rifles w 10 mil ultracite rounds.
---
They better actually prove they can stop dupes before 4/5 star legendaries come out
---
What are the other effects on the bloodied handmade? With the right effects, you can trade for the sniper gun you want.
---
Bloodied hms with good effects are among most desirable endgame weapons in the game. Hundreds of thousands of caps worth.
---
I hopped servers and it worked but the assaultron keep kicking my rump. I'm level 30 and stuggling to find a decent weapon to kill the sog
---
Agreed
---
Very hard to find these mods. I tried scraping my armor thinking it would unlock the mods but it didn't work. So where the hell is these plans? I've looked all over Appalachia for them.
---
So I just got back into the game a couple of weeks ago, and every single time I've done Line in the Sand since, it's had this bug. Makes the event much easier.
---
Fuel is unaffected.
---
‚ÄúMeat Six Days‚Äù
---
 Take my upvote, stranger.
---
Ya I saw that. It's a shame really. Maybe they will buff things more often now since they claim the damage calculations will be easier.
---
I actually love the twigs and vines on tHe PA. Try the responder arms, the red lights on the shoulders give the vines a cool look.
---
Yea someone was commenting about using a "multi-spec" just few minutes ago here. And it gave me some ideas :) Have to see what i can come up with. Heavy gunner / commando could be quite nice. Have to play around with the planner to see if i can make something that pleases my inner neurotic mixmaxer :D
---
Honestly I'm excited. This brings me back to when elder scrolls online did the same thing and it made the game ten times better. Now the developers can focus on bringing more things into the game like "dungeons" or raids. I know it will bring a learning curve but that's okay in my book. Disclaimer I know elder scrolls and fallout are different but the tools they use for "mmo" are similar so far on the path they are taking.
---
556 never lasts a single server. By the time I log off, any 556 I put in vendor will be gone
---
In most cases yes. Normal fire damage you get hit by in the environment is rare, and weak, with molotovs being the main source, which is extremely weak and not worth worrying over. Explosive damage on the other hand is widespread, and so taking the dense torso to reduce explosions to almost nothing in combo with the perk is superior.
---
But, in the colossal problem event the ceiling falling deals a massive fire damage over time effect that even with fireproof deals a savage amount of damage, while the torso mod negates this damage entirely, allowing you to ignore the falling areas entirely. 
---
So if you are running the event asbestos, in all other situations something else gives more bang for your buck.
---
Same. Although I list 9-15k for good bloodied or junkies weapons. I make almost max caps from my vendors daily and I have to sink all caps at other vendors buying ammo, flux and armor/weapons that I resell for profit. I only sell useful weapons anywhere between 500-7000 caps all items priced with 99 ending. Scrip is only 3 stars for 299 caps (people often buy armor as well since 24 scrip is also good). All other 1-2 stars are priced 50-99 caps or even free until I scrip them myself. I like to have caps as I can sometimes buy trade only weapons from vendors in game and flux from other fallout thread on reddit. What I hate the most is player vendors with stupid prices,  saw one guy with ammo blueprinted machines and selling ammo for 2-3 caps per piece and useless weapons for ridiculous prices, had to go one place where radstags fight in a horde and make explosive baits, felt sorry but destroyed his generators and one ammo machine while the guy was afk in his bed :)
---
Bloodied is getting nerfed harder than any other build, but yes, you‚Äôre correct, everything is receiving a nerf.
---
Yeah I think this confuses people, they like blaming bloodied builds for ruining their fun when in fact it‚Äôs typically magic guns that wipe bosses super quick. I think a lot of the resentment against bloodied builds is just misplaced anger from a broken mechanic (that still won‚Äôt be fixed according to the pts)
---
He is probably the best FO76 streamer for gameplay info.
---
That‚Äôs definitely what I‚Äôm going to try out as well. üëçüèª
---
if you value those you wouldnt join a boss fight.
---
I personally have avoided multiple SBQs (lvl 400) on a single server cos i was down to 5 cores and wanted to farm mats
---
When im ready to unload i will.
---
You never have to join a boss fight btw
---
As a flamer guy I buy ALL the fuel, (as long as it isn't overpriced)
---
Broken legendary armor still give the legendary perks but broken armor still gives no DR so that‚Äôs how you use armor for berserkers if you‚Äôre experienced in the build. Because of this you CANT unequip your armor or else you can‚Äôt get it back on. Since you need a power armor or hazmat to get in it‚Äôs impossible to not lower your damage in both scenarios but with what rads you now have a perma hazmat suit max rank with the added benefit of never having rads be a problem again
---
It honestly adds consistency, if nothing else, based on the order of some buffs being applied used to matter. If it‚Äôs easier or not, I can‚Äôt say.
---
I do hope they do something to make the blaster more usable, though - this is the first game in which it doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype. Even four‚Äôs was unique and interesting since we could modify it and turn it into an extremely solid pistol (and later, a critical monster). 76‚Äôs falls flat.
---
There's a new dupe incoming for sure
---
I think there's a PA display being added with Armor Aces. I'm pretty sure I remember reading about it. Let me go look for a source on that.
---
Yeah mate I wasn't saying that I'm just saying with the ammo factory legendary perk it's possible to craft like 500 of one ammo at a time
---
I only price it at 2 caps if im hurting. I even craft it on the fly for return buyers.
---
Edit: im 50 levels into 1 cap fuel. Im just pointing out it can sell for more as it is rare/harder to produce
---
You xbox?  
---
Build?  
---
I have some decent god-roll and god-roll adjacent weapons.
---
Yee it's fairly sad because the calculation change without removing all of this, is essentially becoming a detriment to the player base which acts legitimately. Essentially anyone trying to play the game without exploiting or using cheat guns is being slapped in the face by this until Bethesda is willing to put in the time to remove such things from the game. 
---
The main issue with it is that all the "Anti-DPS" fanatics are still going to complain that the bosses are being 1-shot. Rather than saying "Bloodied, Bloodied, Bloodied!" it'll be "Cheaters! Cheaters! Cheaters!" instead, which is the problem in the first place. 
---
It takes days of preparation to have enough buffs just to kill Earle in under 20 seconds legitimately, it takes a bank card to kill him in under 3 seconds. 
---
That's my only problem with the calculation change, and it's not a problem with the change itself, it's a problem with the complacency of those players who are witch hunting a build because the user is more skilled or holds more knowledge than they do. 
---
And Bethesda's lack of attention to what the REAL problem is.
---
5.56, 308, 45
---
Just about to say I want that coffee pot!
---
No PS4.  of couse  Thanks though!
---
Obviously
---
Two shot gives 2 full explosions. So if you spec demo expert its pretty good.
---
Those are the one you see coming. Don't forget everyone's favorite rodent, the Mole Rat. Those burrowing bastards will eat your camp from the inside out while your turrets decimate the travelling merchant or your ally.
---
I just got back into the game and only JUST started feeling SORT OF powerful. :(
---
I begrudgingly agree though, seeing the bigger guys away a tough monster like a fly was kinda silly. It's just gonna get more difficult for me :/
---
.38
---
I had that the other day. Sometimes it's when you run it "too fast". Need help?
---
It‚Äôs a forceable bug if someone places their tent in the middle of the road that runs in front of Fort Defiance. That‚Äôs why the bug is always there.
---
Oof sorry I didn‚Äôt get back to you right away I had a busy day today. If you‚Äôre on right now I‚Äôll dm you my psn and I can hop on your server.
---
Agreed. So many weapons could be so much better and interesting!!
---
I've been trying new builds and such and honestly have been more scared than angry, with how low they already are and with ps4s damage lag I fear that I will just be too weak for any and all content. 
---
Like I have a shotgun for example that deals about 100 damage per bullet spread, but it affects the health bar as if I just hit them with my bare fists. It's scary that all that will be viable is my bloodied build or heavy guns build but even then will my damage be able to compensate with how little health I have anymore? And will heavy guns be able to keep up at all?
---
Personally, I feel like I've been fed misinformation and it's what's making me panic, but I know for sure that the ps4s damage lag that just goes "No, you didn't just deal a bunch of damage! Infact you did 5% of the damage that was just displayed!" Is going to screw me like a drill. It happens with shotguns and it especially happens with melee where it will just say I didn't damage them period.
---
Yes. Very much agreed.
---
If you have a child she‚Äôs also a main character in Boss Baby on Netflix. Same voice. Actually same personality too.
---
Bloodied technically does less DMG along with everything else, but otherwise not that I know of
---
Oh my. This is genius.
---
This community is pretty much like any other community I've been on. Nothing very unique about it.
---
You can get by with a standard fixer. I‚Äôd use that until you find a better legendary option if we‚Äôre talking stealth. Also make sure to have full unyielding armor for extra agility which directly affects your ability to sneak. Apply the shadowed mod and you can practically breath on enemies without them having a clue. Also note that when you kill an enemy, other enemies will shoot in your general direction so keep moving after each kill. And regarding sneak, the game has issues with enemies burrowing underground such mole rats or rad scorpions. They may cause you to become in danger. Kill them ASAP when fighting mobs.
---
Nice. Best I got was a Junkies Explosive SMG with faster reload
---
I prefer fights with out cheese as well. Truth is duping killed PVP same as the caps market. I hate seeing the bad apples ruin the game I enjoy. Pacifist players need to understand there are people that want things from this game they don't and we keep getting overlooked and pushed aside. I'm XB one GT same as reddit. Hit me up we can shoot NPCs or each other if that gets boring.
---
Wish i could share two perks
---
Yeah, engine's history is not the reason to change it.
---
But endless bugs, exploits and constant troubles with engine use and optimization are a perfect reason to make a new one.
---
**The problem is not in any game engine's flaws or missed possibilities, but in its core. It is dated. It was dated long before Fallout 3.**
---
I wont repeat myself again, thus further words of yours will be ignored.
---
Only imgur links can be added. Upload and link the pic!
---
I just finished today.. then the overseer send me right back!
---
That is not rare.
---
If enemies are killed by energy weapons and turned into ash piles they tend to not respawn correctly.
---
Except they publicly said the reason they made this change is it makes future balancing easier (which should mean more buffs in the future!). They said that not me. It isn't like this was just a flat nerf to damage output, but rather a change to how it is calculated. They just aren't including any of those mentioned buffs in this particular patch or actually revealing them for that matter
---
I've got Soy, Tomato, Mushroom or Hollandaise? Take your pick.
---
I would just hold on to 30 levels and the perks you need for both and ride it out for a few weeks before making a final decision. 
---
From what i hear heavy gunners have been the least affected by the changes. 
---
Its going to be interesting, thats for sure.
---
Lol cool, nice late reply
---
Well looks like I need to respec a little, my plan was to share R5 Adrenaline, looks like Ricochet is staying on for a little while longer.
---
Everyone should have a 1* furious rolling pin set to 30k. PM for details
---
The only instigating lever actions I've come across were a pair of 3-stars in someone's store listed at 30,000 caps each, which I think means "trade me your firstborn" or maybe just "I am showing off". I picked up an anti-armor one-star for 1,000 instead, have yet to see how it compares to my TSE because it's still on the wrong character.
---
I actually think it is baffling they didn't take this as an opportunity to overhaul the meta and rework several otherwise irrelevant prefixes...but maybe it'll come down the road.. :/ 
---
also, :)
---
Damn. Ps4 here. Cross play one day and well pistol whip each others bitch asses like the goldenrye era days!  Much love fellow vault dweller.
---
I am vaultboy at heart forever. I advocate for brothers, trappers, raiders, gunners, responders, caravaners and all.
---
For example - the hunting rifle actually out damaging the lever action rifle at a fifty caliber receiver.
---
I think that's the idea behind it anyways. She is supposed to make it sound forced, hence why it's cringey and annoying. After all, she is a Raider bot.
---
There is currently a bug that lets you reduce a combat shotgun's range into the negatives. For example, I put an automatic receiver and silencer on a combat shotgun and it has a -6 range stat.
---
The "negative" range stats gives it crazy VATS range for whatever reason. It is pretty fun to use a sniper shotgun.
---
I doubt it but that's who Rose reminds me of.
---
.308, then .45, then .556.  I can never keep up with demand of .308.  plus it's so resource heavy to craft
---
Can you imagine if F76 had a guild system like ESO? I think you‚Äôd see more and more people doing that and coordinating their camp space.
---
I saw a merchant camp like that once (before we had vending machines) where a group of friends had their own decorated booths inside one single camp. It was like a shopping mall with real players selling you stuff. It was so cool.
---
I think colloquially they call that a Nukashine. Or in some cases a blackout.
---
I mean. Masks and backpacks go invisible so why not clothes?
---
350 -500 I see on average, that's ok.
---
What is too much for you?
---
well i only sell them for 250 each so that statement is incorrect
---
Thanks for the tip, i‚Äôll try it out
---
I started playing less than a month ago (I started playing a few days after I first signed XBox Game Pass PC and I renewed it today) and I am level 5X. I was not a little trying to try hard on a build. Actually I have just researched about perks and SPECIAL distribution when I was like level 20ish (thank god I did it because I already had 10 on INT). I just played the build I wanted: Sneaky, with a sniper rifle. After some more levels I just went like "oh, it is really useful and funny to use VATS" and then looked a little more on the luck perks and got some of them. The game was just really fun and it didn't impelled me to grind the best build and equipaments. I have read about junkie, mutant, whatever builds and was just like "meh". But I've tried Monongah like four times and only in the last I could finish it (one of them was because of my dumbness in going there only with 2 fusion cores and no repair kits). I finished it thanks to the high level grinders tho, it is clear to me. The damage balance may help my character (because I have not tried the most OP builds I've found etc), but I just wish it doesn't ruin my chances of finishing events "easily".
---
PC, Xbox, or Ps?
---
More than 500 caps
---
I‚Äôm skeptical but willing to give it a chance. I‚Äôm just scared because I have a stealth build and don‚Äôt know how to do anything else. I guess when we can choose load outs now I can make a build for the daily ops. I hope
---
They sound extremely similar
---
They gotta fill the void left behind from buying the recipes for actual money somehow
---
Has anyone noticed the vault 76 dweller with the golf club trying to hit the sheepquatch?
---
Cheers, I'm intrigued to see how this update goes once it's live. 
---
I do like the idea of the calculation change and am not fussed on the damage nerf, my main concern is that the Bloodied build witch hunters, rather than scream bloodied until the sun doesn't shine, will scream "Cheaters". Which essentially were the problem in the first place in terms of the whole 1-shot this, 1-shot that. 
---
I just hope in the long run Bethesda can actually address and maybe act before not only it becomes too much of an issue (Which it kind of already is), 
---
but also before the black market essentially beats them at their own game (They make quite a lot of $$$ already, and with changes to calculations and no changes to anything with non Base or vanilla values, I think the Black market wins).
---
Surely they can tell if a player is holding a weapon with off-values in terms of damage, the sound files used to replicate firing noises and so on.
---
I have a ultracite silenced sniper rifle that does like 230 some dps. I have a three star lever action quad ammo. And a junkies gauss rifle.
---
As much as I like that the datamining group gets credit I would prefer if the individual who did the work themselves got the credit. That would be u/gilpo1
---
P.S. please make sure to let people know that this is preliminary values until the patch comes out tomorrow.
---
I know, good day tomorrow isn't it..
---
Big oof
---
Yeah - PS4 is where it's at.  It's why I hope Sony never agrees to cross-platform play.  Keep the riff-raff out of my Wasteland.  Game Pass - bleegh.
---
good god this comment is so calm and collected in the way it explains the issue and simultaneously eviscerated Bethesda lol
---
It worked!  Thanks for the info.
---
Sometimes leaving the silo and coming back helps
---
Well, today here :-)
---
Well that is why i wrote "don't know their names", now i do.
---
I understand the future reasoning. My point was...good...im not a bloodied/junkie...i dont have magic or god roll weapons
---
Yet i can handle myself in the wasteland
---
It got a little tougher for everyone else while creating the possibility for ppl to get on a level playing field?
---
Good
---
This, plus shotgun shells and .308, is my list as well.
---
New players should have no complaints at all. The game should feel difficult for them in the beginning and as they progress. It is fun to do the event at the airport where a drop comes in and you fight waves of scorched, when you're actually taking a few shots to kill them and feeling like you're fighting against the odds and having to use stimpaks. For new players, at least for me, that felt awesome. It's not fun to just mindlessly two shot or one shot things. It's not. 
---
No matter what nayone says, Bloodied/Junkie builds, ANY build that allows you to obliterate all enemies and solo end game bosses is not fun. It's not fun, you're not having fun with the build after a few times seeing the numbers, you're having fun getting loot. Simple fix really, just make bosses do more damage based on the number of players in the area. If there's one or two players, the boss is going to do more damage, so that at the ver yleast if you want to solo, you better bring a full defensive build with stims and drugs and prepare to spend time. If there's 15 people there, the boss becomes more manageable, it's not going to one hsot people, it's damage goes down, maybe let its health go up a bit. Then gaain, that's probably a whole other system Bethesda will have to implement which will be hard for them because you know DMAN WELL this "One Wasteland" system is going to be so fucked. 
---
I"m thinking like....one high level and a bunch of lowbies, the lowbies will probably do more damage then the high level. Like it'll be more efficient ot bring a bunch of low levels to an event because a high level scales the loot or some weird shit like that. 
---
I rambled, point is, being able to solo the entire game is not fun anywhere near as much as having challenging content that requires a group or at the very least makes you as a solo player have to put in real work to overcome it, not a sneak bloodied sniper round from across the map.
---
I honestly wouldn't trust anything Yong Yea says about Fallout 76.  Pretty much everything he reports is second hand information and most of it comes from Reddit anyways (he's even reported false things posted on reddit, i'm assuming just because he doesn't have enough material).  
---
Many times he is also very slow, reporting things that may have happened weeks earlier.  Even when something positive comes out, he doesn't hesitate to remind everyone about all the bad things F076 has done.
---
He kind of gives me the impression that he never really cared about the game and just bandwagons whenever Fallout 76 is in the news.   Just my thoughts.
---
To answer your question: the game is fun, has a large amount of bugs and exploits, not as much in-depth lore as New Vegas, and mostly cosmetic microtransactions that aren't really P2W.
