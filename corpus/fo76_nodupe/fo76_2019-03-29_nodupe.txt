What’s the weapon? I’m debating whether or not to do it.
---
---
---
Food.  There are recipes that aren’t worth making once because half the ingredients spoil before you can make them.  
---
Just a refrigerator would be nice.  
---
And swapping perks does royally suck.  
---
Make different characters and do it all.
---
I don’t mind people destroying my camp or anything, it’s easy to repair but the repetitive killing me when my screen hasn’t even loaded yet when respawn that is ..kinda annoying. Sorry I don’t mean to sound mean or rude in this post, I just needed to get it all out! Ya’know? 😂
---
I am sure they will do that down the road after the game progresses. The world is as empty or as full as you want it. I find other players on the map and will play with them wether they really want to or not. It seems fine to me because of that. I don’t need NPCs to somehow metabolize some existential crisis in a video game
---
And cats
---
No that’s limb damage. 
---
woodland is darker. It's the same pattern, different colors. 
---

---
pic, if it helps. Camo left, woodland right.

I did pick up a lot of stuff dropped in bags but why should I suffer for not knowing they were duplicated, it's not a troll either they did say when a patch drops so I guess I'll wait it's on PS4 
---
"Crushing Blow" — M79 Grenade Launcher

Double damage if target is full health
---
+50% Limb Damage
---
2star lameeeeee. I would just throw it on the ground.
---
Caps are caps and chems are chems. Gotta get those stims somehow.
---
Mostly yes but no to food. My character needs thirty times the amount of food and water I need IRL anyway. I'd be okay if it was super hard to find water but it'd give you some time where you can think of something besides water. Right now I can't have 15 minutes session without refueling, and it adds none of the thrill to my survival experience.
---
Here-here.
---
This is the kind of product I’m saving my atoms for.
---
Actually in minecraft PvP is unresteicted so your adolescent brain obviously can't handle that some people just want to play the game without being stalked and killed by other players. The game was not marketed for PvP. It was sold as a way to finally be able to play the game with your friends. You assholes from CoD that have no real life outside of the game like to ruin everyone else's because you're one step away from offing yourself but don't have the balls. So you harass other people in video games to make yourselves feel "better" about how shitty you are as a person. Go take a hike kid. Off a tall bridge, with a short rope.
---
If it can't die I don't wanna see it.
---
There's a camp with some flat land and a river with copper deposits along it. Across the road n to the right of overseer camp
---
If not the Atom shop then the Bethesda gear shop because I'd love one of these for halloween. 
---
Yup
---
I was very picky with my location. I wanted it on a rock ledge, by water, surrounded by trees and to have no other building in sight. After sometime looking I had to just settle down near beckwith farm.for the design I got as many plans as I could at the time and spent an hr changing things up. I still change up furniture and how certain areas are laid out. I now have added out budget but it was worth it. 
---
no safe zones,when you die you lose armor,weapons,aid,caps....ect. everything -true survival
---
My brother is a rifle build, I'm melee. He killed a scorchbeast that never landed for me to hit it, and I got no loot (I cleaned up the scorched while he focused on the beast). 
---
If this is true, it has to vary and it has to be a close proximity (too close) and not reflective of how people play the game. The fact that it varies is also unacceptable. If this does exist it makes the lack of xp sharing more nonsensical. 
---
Just because i have it doesnt mean I'm using it.
---
True, the raiders I've talked to in game mainly attack the big ones for the bigger chance of a rich lootbag
---
Totally unrelated to the post, but what happened to the centaurs? I think they would look really creepy with the updated graphics.
---
I drop all of my useless notes in the stash box, and when someone wants to buy plans I dig out the plans so they are the only notes listed.
---
I picked a place that was out of the way and it ended up being too convenient to move basically anything I need is near by. My only complaint is on the rare occasion someone finds the place they don’t close the door when they leave 
---
Sorry it happened to you.  I’ve not lost anything since posting but I’ve dropped a wep and outfit unintentionally since then. Recovered both.
---
Been 1.5 months and I’m trying to be patient :0
---
What this game needs is a text chat.
---
Hopefully she says $it's smaller on the inside".  
---
Staying closed is a different bug and is sometimes fixable. If you're too quick damaging the heart and manage to push it into an additional phase while the first set of adds spawn it will spawn the next set as well but won't mark them or update the event, if you track down the additional spawns and kill them it will trigger the heart to open again. 
---
I understand that armor goes under clothes. It's still not as good of protection as PA, and even if it was comparable there is no head protection, so shots to the face should do full damage.
---
VATS is completely viable. I use a lever action for trash mobs, and I use nothing but VATS with gun fu and grim reaper's sprint. I use the shotgun and vats+gun fu on the ghouls at whitesprings and clean house. 
---
You obviously don't understand the game. VATS lets you hit a moving target without having to aim. It's actually PERFECT and meant for moving targets. Get out of here, you can't even correct me without being wrong.
---
Cool idea!
---
Been using the mode I mentioned in my OP and so far have had no problems and have not been chastised or banned.
---
I now have a few other cosmetic mods, glowing ore and reduced effects in the Scotch Beast attacks dnd no coms from Bethesda. 
---
I shan’t go crazy and will stay with just three or four cosmetic mods and my beloved Perk Fallout Manager, though this is getting complicated by the game updates changing things and stopping it working without changes by the mod creator.
---
I play, but I'm on XBox, plus typically leave the mic off to avoid getting hit on. Especially since my username is unfortunately hella neckbeard bait and I can't be arsed to change it. I shouldn't have to change my username because of others being creeps anyhow. (Plus getting proposal emote spammed by randos on Destiny is hilarious, especially when I'm already married/called for.)
---
Is it just weapons or will we get legendary armor too?
---
They weren't in Fallout 4 due to lore, but they were in Fallout 3. Some of the areas in Fallout 3 (Virginia) are close to the West Virginia border in 76, so they should be within the same region.
---
Do you guys ever look at that feedback?  It seems that no matter how many suggestions people make or how many mods get released to fix longtime bugs, here you guys come up with some other dumb idea no one asked for like 25 different types of alcohol when we can't have more than 3 kinds of shotguns.
---
You're actually missing out on another 100% of your damage by not using cats as a sneaky sniper. Rifle/sneak/cats crit builds are ridiculous. They never have to leave vats in combat except to re engage stealth.
---
You're mostly wrong. I've never paid real money for a gun. I have 5 or 6 explosive guns. Only two are two shot. I traded for one gun and bought one at a vendor; the others were drops from mostly WS and Uranium Fever. They do drop. I get TS about as often as I get the explosive variant. 
---
Adding now 
---
For me, it helps if the location has a hook of some kind.  Before I was evicted by Patch 7's update, I had my house set up next to this campsite with a dead band.  Accessorizing that scene was a fun thing to do.  I'd put a barbecue there, marquee lights, instruments so you could jam with the band.   Even had a makeshift stage.
---
Nowadays, I have a spectacular view of Watoga and the Monorail Elevator that I built the deck and front door around.
---
After Patch 8, I do plan to move to a new location more public.  I've had my eyes set on building inside a power tower in Grafton.
---
Yeah, when I am using vats while doing an event I don't want to target the poor robot that is scared of bees either.
---
Now if only there was a random spawn of a dog, or even wolf for that matter. I'll settle for a wolf
---
Just a bunch of mediocre weapons.
---
I gotta look up the lore on centaurs, I guess. Haven't played fallout 4 in a good while. Snallygasters were made with the FEV, so maybe they later evolve into centaurs.
---
Yes the demon-crat potty.
---
Yes there is a dog and wolf have tamed both of them

Um.  If they're not low hp it's probably not bloodied...
---
South of monogahan power station is an acid resource right next to a power tower.
---
Here are a few I took tonight.

---
On my way
---
I'm not really a different characters kinda guy, but I'll take that idea into consideration :)
---
I use one foundation and a set of stairs. This leads to the main struct. With balconies and a partial flat roof. Turrents are on roof and balconies. Fusion generators inside. This one foundation design fits almost any location. Then only a few items like collectors need to be dropped. Be I do this because I change location to collect different resource or use base camp to cut fast travel costs when doing searches for different items. Can move in 15 min.
---
Sounds like a lot of work to convert from the system they have now,  a simple solution seems like giving us 1 extra 'passive' slot for each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. that can be used for certain cards like the weight reduction or food spoilage cards.  
---
One slot per stat should be OK without being over the top, though offhand I don't have a list of the cards so perhaps that might not work for each stat as well as it sounds like it would.
---
I do agree that weight management is annoying,  however it does make the gameplay feel a certain way that would be lost if you did away with it. Nothing like that panicked feeling when you hear that sound in the middle of nowhere with a pack full of good loot and you've dropped everything you can already ;)
---
I am honestly OK with it the way it is now, but would also be OK with it if they threw us a bone and revised it as well.
---
I've heard people say the plans can drop from Scorchbeasts and the SBQ... but it must be exorbitantly rare if they do because I've never seen them and I've killed quite a few Scorchbeasts...
---
Oh joy...an entire server of people yelling at each other and acussing each other of small penis syndrome.
---
(Yes. I walked into a mic argument in whitesprings ovrr penis size and whose legendary ghoul was whose that lasted 10 minutes)
---
I don't even understand what you are saying, the point is once you reach the top three that's it, no more questing for you...
---
Until the meta isn't one shotting, yeah
---
Great. Thank you for the help!
---
must be rare, as i killed them quite often and never saw a dense plan before..
---
It was there,  I had one for a time but then I told a friend He could craft one as well and went to check out Misc. right under the green toilet and it wasn’t there  anymore.
---
I would do total kills and not total per life on the server. 
---
You can get both of those, i've had a Scorched vicious Wolf, and i saw a post here yesterday or the day before and a fellow dweller had an Attack Dog :) 
---
If u are having a problem with them randomly dying move your camp thingy to a more open spot they try to spawn near it and if u have other objects there they get killed by it when they spawn in
---
There are some really pretty, isolated areas out there. Which makes me even more conflicted about whether I want to be a business or not. Road access is important to get customers, but missing out on those views...
---
I'll look around the Beckwith Farm area and see if anything strikes my fancy.
---
Good luck. That is one sought after knife combo.
---
It's become very toxic 
---
There is one for workshops.  I just want for camp.  The welcome mat at camp seems to be just decorative.
---
Where? I know there's a dog at Harper's ferry (not random), and there are wolves (buy they spawn in groups not solo).
---
How? Where? Please I need to know
---
I rarely think about resources. Sometimes I get set up and realise there's no dirt for my crops or purifiers, haha
---
I need to plan ahead when I build.
---
Spawn point at a potected loby area
---
Ah-ha! Ok then. Assumed wearing welding goggles and the harness outfit. Right on.
---
In your server, guess it won’t let me travel to you in the silo 
---
Yes! I have an open house policy at my camp. I am 100 + and he was 20. He had no idea what I was trying to do until I placed a bunch of lamps in a circle around the paper bag.
---
Animal friend 3 and Wasteland Whisperer 3 - you need a Single Animal / Creature to spawn at a random spawn location for the Tame option
---
Also is there a way to change the flashlight? I like the green and how it seems like that’s what color it should be but having a straight up white one would make it 100 times easier seeing loot and shit:
---
How? Where? Did they remove the parameters (random spawn only, must be alone) or is there a spawn point?
---
While I appreciate the mobility aspect and I think that's really clever, the upside down pyramids are such an _eyesore._ I'm too petty and shallow to have a house that I don't think looks good. Still, it's a great design, from a practical standpoint.
---
I mean. Yeah, I'm just explaining the thought process. I go after anyone on the map and every loot bag I can see, regardless. I'm not like out there hunting specifically for power armor. It's more like I get excited when I see power armor the same way I would if someone surprised me with free candy. Cause that's basically what it is. 
---
Players in power armor don't have a dense torso so even with max fireproof they aren't immune to explosions, unlike players with fireproof and dense. They have no assassin, sentinel, or Cav stacks. At best they have dodgy and empath and empath is a stretch as most players scoff at it. So even if no one was specifically targeting easy kills I'd still expect a player in power armor to die significantly more often. Running power armor in PvP is just setting yourself up for failure in so many ways. At best PvP power armor counters a single build (bloody melee) and just gets wrecked by everything else but perhaps has a place as strict team support by running team medic and spamming stims in a corner. 
---
If you're running PA you're gonna die even without people like me on server.
---
Real bad.
---
When are y'all setting up again? I have needs!
---
But yet different from military paint.
---
It would’ve been awesome.
---
That sounds like a pretty good idea, the power tower one. I can't wait to hear how it turns out! I might try building around a pre-existing structure, myself.
---
For the next civil war pieces I've found them most often at the random spawn just north of Tyler park.  And the witch's costume pieces at the spawn next to the crevasse dam.
---
I have no idea if there's actually a difference in odds though, but that's been my experience.
---
Totally. This is a survival "beta", they should really treat it as such and be trying out some different configurations for the mode to see what gets the best feedback.
---
That is a really good suggestion actually, to have all the boots aggro on a PKer inside the resort.
---
Then just don't claim a workshop...oh, wait.
---
LoL
---
Ah, ok thank you for the info!
---
I was using full sentinel gear with 3 assassin, 1 life saving and 1 chamele9n piece, experienced the same thing. With dodgy and full ap, still taking massive damage standing still.  Finally thru on power armor like whats the point.  I also put on 4 pieces of life saving gear, didnt proc once.  I saw mysterious stranger standing over my dead body a few times also. 
---
Fair points across the board, I agree
---
I just want a Spiked ball mod for my mr fuzzy paddle ball.
---
Saw some at Tangara town.
---
No. You'd still be a dick. You just wouldn't be a misogynist. And I use di k because dudes aren't discriminated against here or anywhere else. You've internalized some shit. Oh, it's totally fine 'cause I'm a girl. Whatever. 
---
In Fallout 4, the Institute had created the local variation of Super Mutants after experimenting with FEV, but the rest of their more "failed" experiments were a bit more controlled.
---
Vault 87 in DC resulted in centaurs, which should have been able to get to other areas, potentially even West Virginia. And the rest of the wreckless FEV experiments in 76 should have resulted in them, too. They gave us snallygasters and hinted at other various experiments.
---
Jokes aside, small changes to appearance according to mutations would be nice
---
Please tell me which gun can currently one shot a proper pvp build? 
---
Because thet especially stated you cant one shot people any more.
---
And no, shooting multiple rounds from an automatic weapon isnt ”one shotting”
---
Or instead of dropping caps double to your level just cap it at 100 easy fix 
---
Exactly and also if it is moved around in the general facility we shouldn't charged .. moving it 2 feet shouldn't cost me 140 caps
---
Try posting on r/market76 as well
---
The one random spawn with a wolf is right down the road to the west of the raider train station vendor at top of the map but like any tamable spawn may take a lot of server hoping 
---
Staggering is the best tactic to combat sentinel armor, so for now it needs to stay
---
Um. Don't even need discord. Just unfriend, kill, refriend. Don't even have to leave the server. People who trade friend and unfriend people all the time in order to make a trade happen. Takes like 3 clicks to do each step.
---
Eh, I'm not really sure about that, most of the "toxic" part of the community would still want those sweet ez kills, and the best way to get them is still camping in front of Vault 76 as far as survival goes.
---
Plus realistically speaking, splitting the two modes would just make one of the two completely dead, just imagine the issues that forced new characters would bring just when it comes to friends joining each other.
---
Nah, I still think that the level cap is the only plausible way to make it balanced, making it in a way that you can join sessions that are higher levels but not lower level ones (So that you can still play with your higher level friends). 
---
I myself like jacking pre-built houses and structures with my camp.  For instance wilson's brothers auto repair I managed to build a 1 story bungalow over the mechanic shop while incorporating the house and shop into my camp via lights, deco and furniture.  Also there is house with many cat heads on walls one could camp.
---
If you downgraded your PV/console and internet connection this would not be an issue. It's still faster than rolling 12 sided dice and moving pieces across a board.
---
Gordan Slamsey

Gordan WHAMsey
---
I'm looking on PS4. 
---
But don't have a lot of caps. 
---
Time to pull out the handmades, with my heavy wep shotgun build. 
---
so you travel to one spot and don't have to load 6 or more times to save money and max your caps every day.
---
I find fellow vault dwellers all the time. Course they kinda stiff and not so talkative.
---
Personally, its exactly as expected. I am by no means good at PvP, so I avoid the death traps like Whitespring and Watoga. I enjoy the occasional encounter with others around the map, even though it costs me some caps and aid. I was suprised by the amount of aid dropped, but was prepared to lose all I had on me.
---
It left a hole in my scavenging/exploring schedule. I actually liked seeing an event start and decide I had enough time to help out and get something nice with most of the server.
---
I create alt, i let alt kill me, i put 10k bounty on alt who has no caps, i ask my friend to kill the alt, we split the 10k and then i delete the alt.
---
Repeat till caps are full
---
We almost done anyway 
---
Theoretically could be so long as the C.A.M.P. Unit is also put up maybe 2-3 stories high. I.e. on one of those steel beams maybe. You would then just need to get foundation to all the way up there, which looks to be...maybe 6th or 7th story.
---
For now.
---
I'll be on tomorrow around 1130 PM eastern time if thats  ok
---
It definitely is. I’m a totally solo player and I love it so far. 
---
Ya it's pretty nuts.  It's basically death match mode. I don't see anyone realistically doing much for quests. Right now there isn't any incentive NOT to shoot on sight.  
---
Double caps, tons of aid, and all your junk you collected. If you meet someone out in the world and you die....you have a longggg way to walk to finish up a quest. Basically there is just way to much to lose right now playing survival mode.
---
I do like the premise but it definitely needs work. 
---
Some things like being well fed and watered. Playing instruments and well rested will increase xp also. But a trip to whitesprings golf club almost always lvls me up. Even without a nuke. Depends a lot on how many people are taking the kills. Do it alone and you will probably lvl.
---
Cool, see ya down there 
---
An entire year worth of planned content and we are only in March. Yeah, totally dead 🙄
---
Well, it works for us most of the time, but occasionally, it does not. I don't know what to tell you. Try it in Whitesprings. Stay in a group. Or don't, and keep playing the way you play. I was just trying to help by telling you how we share loot most of the time. It isn't foolproof, though. You gotta be willing to let a couple pass you by every once in awhile. We're happy with our setup though. Take it easy. 
---
Wow, that's crazy. Out of the hundreds of survival sandbox games I've played, Fo76 has the most restricting, buggy and overall frustrating base building I have ever seen.
---
If that's what you enjoy in here, you probably need a trip sitter if you ever decide to play any other game within the genre.
---
Got proof?  Cause we are seeing a lot of new content now.   
---
You’re probably right, I probably should’ve avoided those areas. I guess I just wasn’t prepared to get killed before my game could load.
---
You just need to add a baby raptor head peaking out of your 'pouch'...
---
From Original post.
---
&gt;So enjoy the ban bud, you clearly are not trying to be a decent player, and even when I told you one of my buddies is learning disabled you kept it up
---
What does learning disabled have to do with anything? Sorry back on topic.
---
From this reply
---
&gt;I didn't try to get him banned lol
---
Uh-huh sure you didn't read your original post.
---
FYI My post to fix workshops/Pvp was a suggestion to help people like you because I kept reading about it and thought a lot about it and changed my mind on the issue since responding to your post which was ages ago. You being a whinny dick is making me start to lean away from it.
---
I've never been PvP'd at a workshop. Nor would it bother me much if I was I'll server hop.
---
I actually said you were grounded past tense and your internet and phone were taken also past tense. But yeah my reading comprehension is bad.
---
The reason you pissed people like me off was because you tried to get someone banned for something that is allowed. Let that set in and actually think about it. Of course we're gonna throw some hate your way.
---
Work on something other than my user name for insults I've heard them all. If fat jokes bugged me I wouldn't use my kewl user name. Or if you must use fat jokes use good ones. I like hearing new stuff here is some examples of jokes I like.
---
I'm so fat I can't even go to the beach because everytime I lay down Hippies try to roll me back in.
---
I'm so fat I sell shade
---
I'm so fat I have harpoon scars.
---
I'm so fat I had to put pictures of my toes on milk cartons to find them.
---
&gt;Go back to McDonalds and demand a free cheeseburger, cause the one you ordered had cheese on it. 😂
---
I did enjoy this 
---
Any new news on this? I’ve been offline for about a month and jumped back on to have this same exact problem happening for me too. I have no way to log in to even get the missions, but it shows Novice of Mysteries: Earn the Phantom Device, Earn the Blade of Bastet, Earn the Voice of Set, Master the tools of the Mistress of Mystery. I’m stumped and don’t know what to do next.
---
There's also the road south of point pleasant and mothman omelettes give 2 char and also sell decently.

Did ypu have pacifist on? Because if you did it doesnt disable it for survival.
---
Aka, you cant kill anyone but everyone can kill you.
---
Died a couple of times and were really frustrated till i noticed...
---
It'd be faster &amp; less effort to earn the caps in game. 
---
On top of that, that assumes no one else gets the bounty. 
---
Or vault 76.
---
Platform?
---
survival mode is the same thing as the game. Nothing changed, just some minor tweaks and bam. Release it has a 'new game mode'
---
And, one guy in one location can drain every vendor on the board of caps at once, since they all share the same cap pool. You thin it is hard to sell stuff now...
---
Ya bro u drop all the aids when u die, you got 100 stimpaks on u. expect to drop a good lot of them when u die.. course its still super weak cause u should be robbed of everything your carrying if there was even the slightest hint at realism.  
---
Thanks, but the link doesn't seem to work
---
Hey man you made the same post 53 days ago.
---
Yes, its buggy and frustrating, but I do it weekly and enjoy seeing what I can do with a neat location. Often spending a few hundred caps moving again because "object is floating" when foundation is buried in the ground. I get a lot of satisfaction though from building a nice camp and getting visitors that like it.
---
Then I trust you’l be moving on?
---
Buh-bye. 
---
The game isn't supposed to be easy.
---
Yes full servers means is dead
---
Survival mode is filled with weakness, people bringing in legendary gear with no risk of losing it stomping on people who never had the means or connections or playtime to match them. welcome to Softcore pvp.
---
ah I see :| no rare plans or rare outfits or atom items? meh
---
Yeah, content planned into Fall... dead as fuck. 😆
---
You okay bro?
---
I too am not getting credit. I got 3 day one and I have killed some starred enemies since then and still no credit. I have killed like 15 legendaries total. Also I am 100% in survival.
---
You can see them on the map in Adventure Mode. 23 other Dwellers jumping around and shooting things dead. Vault 76 had very few inhabitans and if you join a world you are one of that few. 
---
[removed]
---
Dude you also made the same post 72 days ago!
---
Stacking technical data will result in the same reward as 1 technical data. So you are better off depositing 1 at a time.
---
I must have missed the "officially dead" notice they passed around...
---
No I get the combined pool, and think it's great. What I don't get is now having every faction at Whitesprings now, with the combined pool, it's sort of redundant, no?
---
What you smoking bro? 
---
Is there some mechanic that we are missing here? Because some people still seem to be immune to damage while standing still. While others arent. What are the circumstances that cause armor effects to work for some and not others.
---
Im definitely not one to blame every mechanic I dont understand on cheaters. For that reason I'm trying very hard to find some build that replicates these people camping train stations. But im seeing these posts more and more, so im starting to wonder if something is amiss. If it was just an increase in pvp damage no one would be invincible anymore. So my question is what are these people doing different?
---
XB1
---
Have you even looked at the update page? They’re literally already have several updates planned from now to June. new quest lines are coming in the next update? 
---
When my headset broke, I used the earbuds from my Samsung phone. You can buy cheap earbuds at Walmart for $5 thatll do just fine for chat only. 
---
Ah.  Was just searching around the net for some info on this. Glad you can confirm that it uses AP while crouched. Wasn't sure if it was a glitch or what. Definitely makes this mod worthless in my eyes. If you are a sniper and stealth, you are crouched all the time which means you will have no AP for your vats. 
---
Did you befriend it and now its the option to kill it or not? You actually have to make friends with it not just kill it.
---
At no point did I say it should be. Of course, they would properly balance the builds in the game if they didn't want it to be easy. 
---
Plasma Grenade with get him up and about.

Yeah I befriend it everytime and kill it after rose calls me

"The Game is officially dead - Updates will be slowed in the future"
---
Why are you trying to hard to get people to not play Fo76 with your reddit posts?  Did they spill your juice box? 
---
Did you try not killing it? And just running. Killing it is optional.
---
why does that need to be the entire whitesprings?  Just make the inside of the hotel the safezone.
---
I fell for it. I see so much of that talk here and I rarely comment. 
---
Unlocked supply drops are always empty for one of my characters.  Not sure why, probably because of a bug I am assuming. 
---
Yeah, I know it would be a lot more work, but honestly I think that that work is important and necessary to retaining players. They are losing players because of the lack of QoL. The inventory change can be rolled out over time (different parts of it). Its also a stability and performance upgrade. The way it is now isn't scalable.
---
And yeah what you suggested for perk cards is similar to what I suggested in having separate slots for utility cards. I dont think they should be tied to any particular SPECIAL, however.
---
I'm not really ok with it, as is. The whole item/weight management system is time consuming and a barrier between players and the actual game. It's why half the people I know who bought it have no interest in playing it anymore. Eventually I will grow tired of it and just shelve the game. I hope they make some big changes soon. Would be nice if they were making these kinds of big changes instead of spending all that effort on Survival.
---
You're going to love the next update then. One giant shared cap pool of 1400 accessible through every vendor and Whitesprings will have a vendor from each faction.
---
Watoga Vendor bot.
---
It just fixed itself lol I just walked away after killing it and was just running around and like 10 minutes later she called and got a quest marker. Thanks though!
---
He's a one trick pony by the looks of it.
---
Not sure about that. This forces me to see the world. Buy i guess it would cut my grind down
---
Or at least have the spawn location static to where you place the actual CAMP item. 
---
Some people want survival mode.
---
Yet some of those same people don't like that they can also be targeted any time so they still go prey on us passives in Adventure mode.
---
I have 5 key cards wana go again?
---
WestTek, Harper’s Ferry, Uranium Fever, Monster Mash, Nuked Zones, WS
---
In that order. 
---
So are you just wondering what downvote hell looks like. Cuz I think this post will show you lol
---
Not if you want to go around and buy plans or mods from the different vendors.
---
Proper pvp build = bloodied weaps and one of like three legendary armors. That's not balance. Or proper 
---
The loot I received as a quest reward at the end scaled to my level. Not the sloth loot though.
---
Sure 
---
Thanks man. It's a good launching point and I have sure enjoyed reading everyone's comments.
---
Confederate hat
---
Union Hat
---
Civil War Era Tophat &lt;--- the best
---
^ you can find plans for these items, each hat only costs 1 cloth to craft, and with Perks and charisma I sell my top hats (1 cloth) for 38 caps each. 
---
Id be happier with a random 3* than anything they've posted.
---
Still gonna farm aid stuff in survival. WTF are people thinking with the aid they're carrying?
---
Like dude, I've picked serums, nuka-grape, hundreds of stim packs, etc from bags of my prey.   Every one shot at me first.
---
I think the problem with the fast travel mat is that the camp doesn't load in time. If you put your mat on the fourth floor, you'll load in the air, drop and die before your camp is there. 
---
How do you know the people taking damage are wearing sentinel/assassin? Did you test it out? In my experience that combo leaves people pretty much immortal.
---
Not true at all. Fireproof is 45% reduction. Bloodied builds can push 200% extra
---
What? How lol.
---
Why are you all giving him the attention he’s trolling for?
---
What I meant is that there is an invisible wall literally blocking you from standing on it.  I've tried on every one.
---
But yeah, you need to build one camp 3 stories high, then place a new camp midway to reach it.
---
It's more likely that I will find something you want and you'll find something I want and then we can trade.
---
It's no different from buying items from vendors in the other fallout games, accept this time we can negotiate for real, because it's real people on the other end.
---
Cue the "they're not immortal you just have to use gamma guns" rebuttals that always follow posts like this.....
---
Perks are not random except from perk card packs. It’s an Endurance perk that unlocks in the 30s. 
---
Think your forgetting the dense chest mod with that and max fireproof you take zero explosive dmg.
---
This seems to be fixed now :)
---
I went through watoga vendor and find great things most of the time. I ran through the city today and killed 15 legendaries too, so many spawning. 
---
Oh damn I didn't know that. Yeah my white whale is trying to build on the Monorail Elevator. 
---
You don’t get the game. 
---
Windows
---
Good news, seems to be fixed :)
---
Yeah I need some of this action. Looked for that top hat a while near Overseer's Camp with no luck. Any choice spots I should check out?
---
I definitely like the idea of the Whitespring- interior at least- as a sort of 'neutral ground' due to the vast amount of resources and merchants to be found there. ESPECIALLY when the next patch comes round and adds a vendor of each faction type to the Whitespring- would be especially fun in a role-play sense, making the Whitespring a place where members of each group can mingle and trade without fear of being shot in the back, with this neutrality enforced by the army of robots patrolling the grounds.
---
You could take care of all.your vending in one spot, sell off to players what the vendors wouldn't buy, and then go exploring without needing to remember you went to Harper's Ferry to see the robot, not to kill everything and look for desk fans and hot plates....
---
You could have your friend waiting there to do it. Would take literally 10 seconds or less from setting a 10k bounty and having your friend kill them to get the caps. There's an exploit everywhere, and as soon as its found it WILL get used thousands of times if not more until its resolved
---
Not sure, I was actually doing the Power Up Poseidon event.
---
there's a factor were not seeing. I wear 4/5 sentinel (60% reduction) + lone wanderer &amp; dodgy (an additional 50%)
---
I should be at the max 95% mitigation. As the people that have killed me can attest, I'm certainly not immortal. It couldve just been lag, but theres a few times 2 shots have utterly wasted me. Which should only be possible in perfectly tuned bloody melee.
---
True. I can imagine lowbies running around grabbing 1400 burnt books fresh out the vault 😂
---
NEED MEH CAPS
---
We searched for a solid 10 minutes before ultimately giving up. :(
---
Try again, I guess I got the link before I fully shared. I can pull it up on my PC, but not on mobile for some reason.
---
I have talked to 3 different people with full sets. That were being killed while standing still. Also I was being train camped with another guy in game that stated he had a full set. He was dying as fast as i was. Ill add that i was bieng killed by 2 bullets from a handmade while sprinting in 5 pieces of cavalier Assassins.
---
One of the discord’s I was in. Someone was able to gain 139% or so of ballistic resistance. So in terms they didn’t take damage. Posted a clip of it in the group as well. The resistance only lasted for last 15 seconds before it came down. But no idea how, why, and for what purpose. 
---
It would have been better if the rewards were a little less random. I mean, I get that they wanted to have rare masks, but half of the plans I earned were the hanging snowflake decoration. I got maybe... one recipe and 3 decorations
---
If there is a text chat, I hope it's not like the PC text chat mod. It ran less like an alternative to voice and emotes &amp; more like an in-game discord server, particularly with global chat.
---
Had to stop using it as people just spammed general chatter &amp; trade market rather than character interaction. 
---
At lvl 50 you should be able to kill the Sentry Bots at Whitesprings and there are usually 4-6 at a time. They drop fusion cores and other useful junk.
---
I actually just had this group of two, one blocked me so I couldn't see him on the map, can we, started the process of initiating pvp by taking the workshop. I left, letting them have it, then they both left too, not even taking over the workshop, just so that they could kill me. They chased me from Charleston Junk Yard to the nuka cola plant. In adventure mode.
---
Serendipity, Dodgy, Evasive, Auto-stim
---
Yea I should but I don't really have any upgraded weapons at this time. 
---
Thats the same spot i did.  Just server hoped (took a few days of trying) till i got it.  Once i did find it, I had a friend hold the map for me while i looted it on all my alts too.  
---
Golded for similar feels.
---
Side note, I do feel like corporate efforts at auto targeting would produce absolute dumpster fires, so props to Bethesda for historical accuracy...
---
Well I’ve got no idea for the discrepancy than. That was my best guess.
---
What’s left of it after the Dwemer used it anyhow. 
---
So I take it you only have one set of power armor.......
---
EVERYBODY PACK IT UP AND STOP HAVING FUN CAUSE I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME!
---
Did Todd Howard hurt you? Do you have a large bet with someone? Did you wager your soul with the devil that this game would fail? 
---
Something similar to the waves you could spawn in FO4. That would be great, and would give us a reason to actually sit at and defend our camps.
---
you have to have max level Tank killer for auto rifles (perception) or Enforcer for shotguns (agility). What these do is stagger them while firing which negates the sentinel effect and causes their character to do a stumbling animation during this time they will take full damage. The other way is VATS critical hits, crits ignore the sentinel and cavalier effects of armor completely. Also you have to be dealing serious damage meaning you need all 9 levels of commando, shotgunner etc.
---
Lol I haven't even been to white springs yet.
---
Yea message me 
---
Well, I provided an actionable alternative to how the game could have been released, so I'm not sure what else could reasonably have been expected as constructive criticism, given the topic.
---
As far as how it should have been handled, if you accept that the game could have *been tested sufficiently before release* and also still have been financed by the atom shop (which I do) then nothing would actually need to be changed.
---
If you think for some reason that the DLC would *need* to be independently paid for in order to release a polished game...well, I don't really understand that reasoning, so I'm afraid I can't offer much advice on that score
---
The script only checks for item accumulated, not how they received the items. 
---
Ad Victorium paladin.
---
I'd like it but I'm gonna hold out till legendary vendor I think we'll be able to get better rolls than the preset ones Bethesda gives out 
---
Everybody wanted a PvP server until you couldn't toggle it off lol.
---
well if you guys haven't been doing main quest then you might have tons of technical data saved. FYI you can probably make a mint selling/dropping one at a time for some folks on the marketplace over at fort venture.
---
Bethesda, they anounced it in the overview for next week's patch.
---
So .. I do it every day..   it's supper easy to farm caps/plans and go on a selling spree
---
Whitespring finally established as faction neutral ground. I like it
---
Tell him it wasn't *real* communism.
---
It's either be positive and say you love the game or you get down vote brigaded and hated.
---
Well for me I live just a little southeast of top of the world  on the small pond without the Brahmin. Moreover I really enjoy the spot. I do get foot track here and there with plenty of firecracker berries, dirt, water etc to go around the one complaint I do have is it’s a tad small. Im limited to expand out with trees blocking a junk of live-able space but my crops go there anyways so eh 
---
Yeah it can be pretty rough, but I'm loving it so far, I created a new character i got my ass kicked a few times by high level people but also I managed to kill some. Also the pve can be a bit more hard since you can't spam stimpaks that easily. So far I'm a fan of this mode but needs more work...
---
Putting them in containers only seems to work 1x for me per server.  But what worked 100% was having someone trade them to me 1 at a time.
---
👍
---
All the PvP players asked for a separate game mode, got it, and now do everything they can to not participate in the essential mechanics of it, like staying exposed to other players while traveling.
---
I have written down that I found the wooden stool plan at the sutton station. GL.
---
While ya are at it, why am i hearing the tinkering sound clip from across watoga when someone is using it at the train station? it grinds my gears. bugged maybe?
---
West Tek being labeled as 'connected'... Man I swear, if Sheepsquatch turns out to be some freaky ass sheep-Super Mutant, I'll be so happy. Or even like a weird sheep-Deathclaw.
---
Only an eyesore if you make it one. Mine is average but improving. I have seen some really cool places built on one foundation. Use your artistic side. You may actually impress yourself.
---
With blood and steel!.... Really, just have more then one heavy weapon and have a secondary weapon system. For example, I use a Minigun as my main, a LMG as my second, a 10 mm SMG as my mob clearer, a wieghtless board for just in case, and I swap out weapon systems all the time.
---
I use all these except autostim since im 5 piece cavalier. Not saying it isn't possible that autostim is the key here. But im not sure a stimpack would even come remoteley close to healing through the damage that was being done to me and my mate.
---
probably
---
Thanks, I will keep at it!
---
Well i dont have sentinen or assassin armors but been having a blast in pvp with my ts tesla rifle
---
True, but could just require it to be placed on terrain. Like how the Camp is initially placed 
---
I’ve got one LL armor piece but it’s not great but I have a ton of RA and so does a few of my buddies but really looking for handmade rifles
---
I was looking for some the other day, by Dyer Chemical, they were strangler pods. I server hopped about 5 times and finally they were blooms instead of pods. Not sure if the event was going on, I didn't think about checking.
---
Having a hard enough time keeping the CoD crossovers from staying on Survival as it is. They can barely handle being flagged for PvP all the time and not being able to select which players can attack them.
---
I'm down for multiple PvP servers, but I would really like to see PvP removed completely from Adventure mode for us passives. You know, the majority of Bethesda's original fanbase.
---
Message me a price I’ll be on this weekend 
---
I feel your pain. I keep turning it in, hoping to get BoS power armor paint jobs (ALL I WANT IS PALADIN AT THE VERY LEAST) and I just keep getting Stimpaks and 40mm grenades. I'll never turn down a free stimpak, of course, but still.
---
You can make 1400 caps a day from sales, you can kill your alt in 2 seconds and make 10k.
---
What is the original purpose in game for those is my question lol
---
Just on the off chance it's a Windows thing. Try playing the game with the laptop keyboard. Not your external to see if you can move. If you can it's a Windows issue not a game issue
---
Damn, that bitch wouldn’t drop!
---
Everytime something for 76 is getting announced, people rage and assume it's battle royale. When it was first announced, everyone said it, when survival mode was getting announced, people said it, now this
---
If you're using VATS in PVP that's why you keep getting smacked around trust me. In PVE sure because the AI isnt that smart.
---
If you're trying to use vats against a blooded melee player, who probably has speed demon you're gonna get your skull crushed. That's why you keep dying.
---
As I type this I own 5 workshops and am #2 on my survival server currently hunting down #1.
---
Your complaint is that you keep dying to these builds and you get defensive when advice is given to you by someone who actively seeks out PVP. Continue to get owned hope I see you in the wasteland of these days.
---
Ammosmith and super duper are your friends. Beyond that take over the ammo factory. However thus is not a problem. This design and a good one. The point lore wise is that you are constantly scavenging for everything. It may not be glamorous but what fun would it be if everything was given to you? Unlike the other games, you're not THE one. So you won't be able to much by yourself. Exactly as it should be.
---
Sadly 
---
That's too bad. Sucks when we're careful but something still breaks.
---
I think what they mean is that the entire Summer content 'season' is CALLED Nuclear Winter, and the Vaults are coming as Summer DLC, not that the Vaults ARE the Nuclear Winter game mode. Nuclear Winter could still possibly be a battle royale I guess (though I highly doubt that)
---
Can launch one again? and try to get more people if you can 
---
You have ammo Smith and Super duper maxed out? Makes it so it's actually viable. You can also buy ammo from people for relatively cheap, or buy the materials. I also have friends who give me their excess ammo that I need and drop them ammo for their guns, or just trade the .308, .44, 5.56 for 5mm and .50. 50cal eats ammo as do miniguns and unless they're legendary, don't do it, just save up a while
---
Then you have the people that wanted PvP until they realized they were also a target. Now they roam around Adventure mode trolling passives.
---
The one in Chernobyl still is. However I recommend a Hazmat suit.
---
Was about to point this out as well
---
Regular guns are more powerful than TSEs now
---
I have a lvl 40 3 star leather unyielding with weapon weight reduction. I am on PS4. You interested?
---
Bethesda does not know they're dupe's. They only count how many your account has. You had way too many of something to explain it away. Maybe you are innocent. Bethesda doesn't really care. They set out to end a problem. You managed to get caught up in it.
---
I don't know, does he like butter tarts?
---
I can definiteley rule out the stumble animation as there wasnt one. Me or my mate were not dying during a stagger at all. I cannot rule out the VATS crits,  But there was never a period where we were immune from damage and then suddenly not. Which would be the case if they were having to bank crits. Both of us were taking Full damage everytime they shot at us.
---
Yeah, in F4 I made sure to try to de-mod as many weapons and all armors (so that they would stack). 
---
That very message is what caused to to stop playing the game &amp; not touching it again
---
That, and pretty much any of the ones that weren't part of the Mire Ghoul colony decided to leave Appalachia and journey to the Capital Wasteland to found Underworld, as the notes at that one cabin near Vault 76 heavily imply.
---
I'm a bar vendor. 
---
The hottest thing that I can't keep in stock is Ballistic Bock. 
---
I had 30 stashed.  A dude came through and bought all. Grinded and got it back up to 70 that day. Within 10 minutes of finishing,  they were all gone again.
---
T-two
---
S-shot
---
E-explosive
---
 
---
Just because bullets explode doesn’t make it a TSE it just makes it EXPLOSIVE
---
This is why we need survival only characters
---
I find 5mm in 100 stacks all the time on super mutants. Super duper and ammo Smith are a must when crafting. Heavy gunners don’t run around using their heavy gun ammo on random mobs or when out farming. Heavy gunner and melee basically uses the same specials so you should be running around as melee with maybe a rifle for normal play, then swap perk cards and weapons before queen fights. It all comes down to playing your situation properly. Save the big guns for when it matters. 
---
Its called headshots bro. Show me a sentinel/assassin's helmet.
---
I’ve gotta repair, but I would be up to try again 
---
So I'm a level 27 running with another player who's around 17 in my very small local based crew. I and my team have our C.A.M.Ps stationed round the Gorge Junkyard and river area. We usually defend the workshop there to farm the Black Titanium of later game purposes. (We have been in since day one but stopped playing during the duping scandals so low level we are). Point being...I've on multiple occasions encountered higher levels that come and offer items when we own the junkyard. It's crazy...instead of obliterating the workshop claim...they lay down like...offerings (gear, armor, plans, junk, food)...and emote that they wanna use the resources at the workshop. They give me time to collect our resources and to take the turrets down and such and we just log and server hop. One guy just stuck around one day and helped defend the workshop and showed off his massive and beautifully decorated power armor suits (wish I had gotten a pic before he reshelved them as I was blown away.) But most of all is when I find the little brown paper bags in my C.A.M.P filled with stuff. Like, I feel like higher levels are watching me from afar and dropping presents like a Power Armored Santa Claus...
---
The reason I wrote this is because...as sappy as it seems...this makes me feel loved. By people I don't even know and who don't expect credit. Like senpai noticed me and I don't know who the hell senpai is but it excites me about humanity. Like there is a difference between the guy who was *trying* to hand me (reasonably) upper level stuff through trading and the guy who refused to let me go through with it by repeated slap damage every time upper level tried to keep me from running about. 
---
I'm not ever gonna ask a handout, because this is war and it never changes...but I am grateful for these types of players by far. I expected to be treated harshly at times, but really...hasn't been the case. So thank you multiple senpai! 
---
Name is PachinnkoJones. If you ever see me parked on the river by Gorge come say hello! I like C.A.M.P plans and armor plans for my team. But my C.A.M.P and purifier are open for use and I'd be happy to help anyway I can.
---
Or attack the other players on site in survival mode. 
---
She dropped on PC
---
I have to wonder where exactly all those vendors are going to go... maybe in some of those locked rooms around the Whitespring interior?
---
Me and my fiance play together
---
There was one during the beta. I still have mine
---
Same I’ll let you know 
---
Ant lager. Gives +50 carry weight
---
I checked both of them dident find it
---
I've had the same camp since I discovered Junk Nodes, mine is centered between the different vendir factions. After the patch I can finally go find one a little more creative.
---
 The minigun eats ammo like a hungry hungry hippo. Use gatling gun for your day to day its easier on consumption. And just get used to melee back up. Heavy alone is a pipe dream. 3 points into 2 handed is not much of an investment  for 30% damage and a fully modded baseball bat puts out good damage and weighs less than 3 pounds. 
---
Is something you have verified in game on a person with full sentinal/assassin?
---
Save it. The best is yet to come.
---
Isn't that the whole point of the game? Having to constantly farm for resources? Game was a lot more challenging and enjoyable when I was low level, low on ammo, chems, food and I really wish resources would be a lot more scarce than it is right now. I find myself wanting to run my low level alt just to re-live that experience
---
Vintage Nukashine and a boxing glove?
---
Oh yes, great lord. Because it has nothing to do with the broken build. You won't as long as you stay on survival
---
As long as there is mechanics to get people into pvp unwilling there will be people seeking to take advantage of such situations. 
---
I know that would cheer me up.
---
I kind of like the solitude. I really miss NPC’s but I don’t really want to share either. I’m still pleasant to others when we meet but I don’t seek them out. 
---
I had kind of chalked it up to me not having launched at Prime yet, though I've dropped nukes other places. You get a different holotape from her I think for each action.   
---
But I like the idea of continuation of her story a helluva lot more. 
---
People might disagree but Uranium fever is useless with items capping at level 40. 
---
Check all vendors daily if you have time for it. Watoga always has legendaries that spawn. Horde events have guaranteed legendary spawns but some areas spawn low level enemies. West tek. White springs if people aren’t already there. 
---
I’ve also noticed when you roam hunting for them they never seem to spawn or you always end that session with disappointment. Lately I’ve just been playing and doing events. Legendaries spawn and their drops come off as surprising and exciting vs chasing them and being let down over n over again because it didn’t drop what you were hoping after looking all day
---
I justify this by calling it the Star Lord mask, and we all know Star Lord doesn't wear a helmet.  Stress that this is a justification only.  Would like to rock a hat with this thing myself.
---
Being nice to low level players is pretty much my endgame
---
Heathen!
---
“When you loose 200 stimpaks in survival mode” 😂
---
That really don't understand the hate for Mics
---
I'm a vendor that tries to sell Aid items. And it's so frustrating that I have to put a menu up because no one wants to sit here and communicate with a mic
---
Which vault is that inside? I didn't know any were open yet
---
That sounds cool, but I always wanted to seem like an Enclave Commando so an Enclave officer hat or beret would look great
---
😂😂
---
Yeah that could be true
---
This account is on some r/conspiracy level of shilling
---
The problem is that most plans that are on one vendor are region locked not faction locked so they still won't appear
---
I've used VATS the entire time on this build. It can't be dodged, so I don't know what you're implying. The only people I have an issue with are the bloodied folks.
---
Also, I have a really hard time believing you are holding 5 workshops as #2 on a survival server. I highly doubt that.
---
I ended up getting into alpha, but all the bs gltiching inside prevented me from completing it so I just rage quit 
---
Here's hoping player vending works similarly - as neat as it'd be building up camps as trading posts it'd be so much more convenient to also have a row of vending machines at the whitesprings for every player on the server selling stuff.
---
Actually makes gunfu useless if it chooses a friendly :(
---
Instigating is the *only* choice for snipers. It can turn any decent rifle into an incredibly powerful tool.
---
They could fix it by actually separating the two play modes fully, like WoW or any other online RPG really. This game was not sold as a PvP free for all. It was sold as a way to explore the wasteland with your friends.
---
Watoga station like other post said, however, you need to purchase light and sturdy plans first.
---
The events are also fast travel points, and they may be traveling there hoping to kill anyone in the event. 
---
People are REALLY REALLY bad at PvP. REALLY BAD. Like holy fucking shit what are you doing here? 
---
I cannot wait till player vending comes in so I can sell back everything that these players are gifting me.
---
Seriously its a fucking free for all PvP mode where you drop shit loads of stuff on death. Why the fuck are you running 3x Travelling Pharmacy and hauling 200 pounds of aid in fucking Excavator Armor. 
---
Oh those? Those are the figurines you could find in lunch boxes in the mechanist dlc for fallout 4 i think.
---
I think its rewarded for one of the initial BoS quests as well. 
---
Was my go to outfit for my main, and I accidentally sold the thing ffs. Just got it on my alt and plan on moving it over. 
---
Pump-action. Always wanted one since I got into the series with Fallout 3, and after getting one in New Vegas it was pretty disappointing to see it not come in with FO4. So it's cool to get one again.
---
Think there's a glitch out there. Some people just wouldn't die. I seen some redditor bitch about Bethesda not looking into this invulnerability issue and threaten to spread the method if it's not fixed asap. 
---
And about that builds difference, srsly if someone put that much effort into this game that he got full ass/sentinel gear, it is very unlikely that he's running a shitty build. Of course most of them are all optimized for survival.
---
Turns out logging back in through the game fixed it. 😥
---
Gamma guns are for taking out unyielding bloodied builds. We just tell people that are to lazy to learn game mechanics that it works on sentinels as a joke fyi. Most of the people I kill have sent or cav its simple if you plan on everyone having it and make a pvp build. 
---
I'd imagine it'd be difficult to not be able to target your Brahmin or turrets being that this is the case in FO4, where anything either living or turrets(friendly or enemy) will always be targeted, especially if you ever created turrets in the Sanctuary . Completely understand where you're coming from though.
---
Weird. I found these as part of a chess set, labeled as bishops.
---
Yes! I have wanted this since day one. I really hope this becomes a thing. Maybe not as altered as yours, but some kind of physical evidence of the mutations would be nice.
---
I'm assuming you are looking for the Top Hat plan?
---
I had to spend two days relogging and relogging and relogging to find it.
---
One cloth is all it takes to make one and it sells for 32 caps (for me).
---
Most people aren't going to have one, let alone an extra one to give. However, if you're looking for the most time efficient way to try and farm the Civil War Reenactor, go to New Gad.
---
When you fast travel there, you'll be facing the south and turn to your 9 o'clock. As in, take a 90 degree turn to the left and the area right in front of you (across a small stream) is where he can spawn.

This spot shares the same random event list as the Overseer's Camp I believe, except you won't have to run the 100 meters to get there. You can just relog, turn, if it's not there relog and try again.
---
I spent HOURS trying to find it though. RNG is real. 
---
How
---
I understand that some people don't like it (people can be anti social or just have had too many bad experiences) my idea was just for it to be an opt in option so if you want to be more social, you can. If you want to be mostly solo then you can
---
Yeah,it has been fixed although it looks a chrome shotgun than a camo one.

---
Jusy because you suck doesnt mean I do. I was number one before snapping the pic but apparently time from previous servers count also.
---
You're definitely making the leaderboards lol
---
Bulking should for sure reduce junk weight. Its 1/10 the item count. They could afford to give us that.
---
All of my armor I am using I grinded for myself. None of it is Assasins. Most of it is AP regen or rad resist with sentinel. All of the Major prefix are terrible. Zealot's, Hunters etc. This armor is more than enough to give you survivability.
---
I run with a Vampires Explosive Combat Rifle and a TSE Handmade. I bought the handmade. I bought/traded for basically every rifle and shotgun in TSE varients and I assume they're all from duping. There was simply too many of these weapons for everyone. 
---
And as far as defensive perks feeling worthless, I suggest you look deeper into health regen.
---
So far its the best material cost for caps that you can get in game (1cloth to make it and it sell around 35 caps with 3* trading perk).
---
But the plan only spawn in random encounter and not all random encounter spawn this specific plan.
---
How much and sure
---
I agree with this. I had a Trouble shooters sniper rifle lv. 50, .308 and a lv 40 instigating sniper rifle, .308.
---
The 40 instigating did more damage than the 
---
50 troubleshooters during Watoga farming runs.
---
I did the same but if you move your camp too close (in some areas) it will make a glitch meaning you get to move your camp for free I think it's resetting the camp to where you place it or something? But it was very very frustrating as I spend time and loose everything, thanks for letting me vent
---
There are actually bunches of them. I have sentry bot, assault on and protectron figurines
---
I've got a spare owl and soldier mask if you are on ps4 
---
Ammo is fairly cap dense. It should prove to be a popular vending commodity.
---
It would be cool if you looked different when you are mutated 
---
Not gonna happen. The idea behind the whole pvp system of Fo76 is to promote players murdering each other, so the reward has to come from the victim.  
---
If you move the CAMP machine within your CAMP circle it will adjust where you spawn in. It's rough and won't let you spawn into a fourth floor, for example, but you should be able to move onto the cliff.
---
Willing to still trade have plenty of patterns and caps.
---
Hah, and have every F076 troll crawl out of the wordwork and demand that Bethesda get on their knees and beg forgiveness because "Oh no you said you wouldn't Pay To Win Bethesda how could you"
---
What do you think it's worth? I'm not a big trader. I'm fair.
---
Did not know that. Where are light and sturdy at??
---
Okay so what is your pvp build
---
Or players with pacifist mode on. Or NPCs during events you can’t damage anyway.
---
I never said you have to
---
Then you wouldn't have to join it would be an opt in system
---
/s
---
My bad it's a left leg not chest. I'm so sorry.
---
Sturdy is definitely same place, im not 100% sure on light...it may be in the same place or it may be from the free states quest line in the main quest, I cant remember...I had light before buying from watoga and cant remember where I got it 
---
Want to meet up at my new bar? Gt?
---
Honesly either am I lol I add me on PlayStation name is the same as my screen name. 
---
Would 1k work?
---
The scorched don’t ever seem to be a problem. I run Whitesprings fine. The SB’s were the problem 
---
Wanna join up at my bar? 
---
Did they remove Ark, Conan and Rust from the market?   
---
You haven’t provided any actual argument for your opinion, you just keep repeating the same thing. I understand you feel entitled to better items than everyone else because “muh survival” and I’m happy for you. 
---
2). They did. Supposed to be invincible for a short time to prevent spawn camping, ending after a certain time frame or your first shot. It doesn't work. 
---
3).  Easy caps and aid.  If you get killed at a spawn point and choose to spawn there again, consider it a life lesson. 
---
I dont mind you asking, but I prefer to keep the build i have tweaked and made to myself.  There are many similar and very many great pvp builds, i sujest doing a bit of research on game mechanics then pick one that works for you.
---
Wish I knew about the woodland walker paint before I picked up the bundle, would much prefer that over the desert pattern but now I'm broke
---
Could somebody drop a nuke on my head? 😂 Need the trophy but it didn't work yet 
---
Sweet! go farm that weekly without any interference! 
---
I’m not complaining, just adding my feedback. I enjoy the world of Fallout and would love to play a version of it in a hardcore survival setting. 
---
I don’t see the harm in adding a game mode. I don’t feel entitled to it though.
---
PS4, I’m sorry, should’ve stated that.
---
What system?
---
Oh shit your right ps4
---
I have 4500
---
YES. Basic request but so needed
---
Then you die. \*shrug\* Your choice.
---
Hey there, just a heads up, if you want to tag a user, replace the r/ at the beginning with a u/ :)
---
Thanks.  I'll try that.
---
Adding a vendor from every faction to white springs not only feels like narrative progression, it’s a good way to encourage players to gather in one area to trade, and it also saves all the bullshit traveling around to make my 1400 per day. A great change I didn’t expect.
---
This isn’t true. You can just keep server hopping until you find heavy.
---
Tbh, adventure mode has really improved, but that’s soon going to be ruined by pvp players from survival deliberately messing it up. I’m well over 500hrs and had played daily, I’ve not played for 2 days now and I’m considering uninstalling since survival completely ruined it. 
---
Wish I hadn’t spent months defending Bethesda now.
---
What are you asking? 
---
I have one also, can you craft them?
---
Does anybody want to hit whitespring with a nuke with me I can help
---
I tried that my first time around and gave up and just bought the sturdy, then the next time the vendors reset Heavy was there.
---
Well that's not how the percentages actually work. It's a stack. The first sentinel piece gives you 15%, the second gives 15% off the remainder, and so on and so forth. So with 4/5 you actually get 44.376% reduction with your armor, not 60%. Furthermore, I don't know if perks affect the stack before or after armor perks (I would assume before) but if the perks affect it first, you get the 30% from lone wanderer, 20% from dodgy affecting the remainder, and then the stack effects. If it were that way, you're still taking 29.233% of all incoming damage. Still, a crazy reduction though and I can't believe you were getting two shotted
---
Only been on for 2 days or something but, I've had the same password used each time it's been no problem
---
Melee build! Make a melee character, collect tons of ammo, twink between characters! Thats my idea.
---
Hmm, interesting. I don’t have sturdy but found heavy after a few hops.
---
Agreed, it was silly and kind of stupid, but I think generally people had fun. Fallout is kind of silly and stupid, so it fit well.
---
I just thought it was interesting they wouldn't use the new Protectron models.
---
I have vegetarian, marsupial, and bird bones. I hope they give me feathers. :)
---
15 seconds? Barely lasted 5
---
Totally not the right response,  was not implying you were saying that, chief 
---
Wow guys look at this dude! What a hero! I'm gonna name my kid after them!
---
By default on Xbox, pressing the "View" button will switch between first and third person. Holding the same button goes in build mode after camp is deployed. To exit, press it again.
---
Have you ever played Ark and tried to build a house boat? Now that is buggy. 
---
76 building is pretty smooth imo.
---
I did, and the legendary grenade launcher is pretty fun if you don't mind using a stimpack every time you shoot it.
---
At first I thought it may have something to do with the update, but it may have just been a coincidence too.
---
Why should players be rewarded for playin in safe mode
---
Someone's a cunt
---
Why not an eyebot?
---
So what you're saying is the OP strats that everyone else uses should be taken away, but the one you use is fine and should stay.
---
Got it
---
Max level hunting rifle more powerful than handmade 
---
Bro im 900 hours in, my sole purpose has been pvp. Trust me I understand the mechanics in this game pretty damn well. The reason i ask you to post your build isnt because i dont. Its because your response to this is that it is build related. Which is a pefectly reasonable explanation.
---
Okay well im pretty optimized for pvp already so whats so different about your build from mine? What makes your sentinal Assassins gear work when you stand still and mine not? or are you running cavalier Assassins? If so is it working for you when you sprint?  Are you aiming at the head to kill people in that gear? Are you banking crits? If so how do you build up a crit in the 2 seconds it takes me to spawn? These are all viable questions. 
---
 I didn’t know they could effect the adventure mode? How does that work?
---
And that's great, man, I appreciate your input and I am glad you guys have a rhythm you are comfortable with. I've noticed getting team loot most the time, too, so that's great. I would like to see them fix whatever makes it fail sometimes. That's a reasonable request. Like I said, I like playing with a team, but it does suck the way you have to do it to get XP. Lots of people I play with are sub 50 or in the 50-70 range. XP is still a huge deal, and with the prestige system they are planning, XP will be a big deal for every level of player. 
---
Woodland is much darker than the regular Camo paint, which really was always inappropriately bright for camouflage anyway.
---
Good to know. Glad it's fixed
---
I wish players would drop full inventory when killed and if I break into your camp I should be able to steal from your stash!!!! 
---
thank you for you guys comments.
---
@hoonface. Yes I do, but I also removed all of them and the problem persisted.
---
@p1xelprophe7EXE. Thank you for letting me know, I was wondering if that would fix the issue. I think I will do that. 
---
I had my CAMP on top of Seneca Rock for a while, until I forgot to wear power armor too many times. I fell to my death way too often from fast traveling back.
---
That was fun! At least we eventually killed her. 
---
Check for it after work! Thanks! 
---
The paint changes the texture to tan with blood, however you still get the armor rating of BOS.
---
Have you ever used a Beserker Build? Or a plain Bloodied build without the 25K sets of armor? 
---
It isn't overpowered, it has a balance to it, it's when you start adding in secondary effects, Bloodied becomes so insanely powerful that it seems 90% of the people you see PvPing use it. So if you remove those secondary effects, it becomes far more fair.
---
Beserker Builds are possibly the most Glass Cannon builds in Fallout 76 so far, yet still seem underpowered to many people which is why it is so hard to find one that uses it as a primary ability.
---
Bloodied builds have the counter of anything armor piercing, all you have to do is cut through the outer shell and you can kill them rather quickly.
---
But a TSE, Assassins, cavalier build, what is the counter there? Throw yourself at them till they run of ammunition?
---
One of my teammates was using a handmade and was merking everyone.  I came across a guy who i couldnt damage with my aae shotgun, but my handmade teammate was able to kill him.  I think tank killer might be the key.  I could kill everyone else with my shotty for the most part.   I Decided to switch from sentinel to cavalier, while you decided to switch from cavalier to sentinel lol.  
---
Use your microphone? (Only a joke don't attack me)
---
Loot everything. 
---
You run berserker and wonder why you die so fast? Lol no armor 
---
Wow a deathclAw outfit..I'd pay 5kcaps
---
*whispering* he knows too much
---
Lol im gonna look into tank killer tonight
---
A guy stalked me and we faught and I died, he was full sentinel and was at 20-30%health from a non legendary handmade before I died. It was a close fight but the weapon damage has been altered alot I'd say
---
Everything is a skill or at the very least has an element of skill to it, i understand that being good at this game is half your characters strength and half the player behind the keyboard/controller. Not only did you not counter my argument about the rng being pure luck you resort to assuming that im bad at game mechanics (playing the game) simply because you can’t handle that your gear and character build are trash. Keep telling yourself that while in the fetal position in the corner of your room :) I truly hope you find comfort in it.
---
I'm not saying not to talk about how good the game is. I didn't say that at all. I said people who say they've /just/ started playing thinking the game was as functional at launch as it is now are ignorant. And I'm tired of seeing them act like several months of patches didn't exist.
---
CANTREADJester
---
Just because you rate personal ability by time survived in a video game doesn't mean it's valid 🤷‍♂️
---
Same reason it didn't work for diablo.
---
People wont want to play to get stuff. They'll just wait for it to show up on auction. 
---
Good job though. I wouldn't even dream of touching survival mode. Not my thing. Unless it was hardcore thirst/hunger/heat/cold hard enemies etc. I don't mind challenges. I mind broken.
---
I think I saw in a comment on the main thread of the devs saying they're looking into an implementation of breaking down ammo in order to recycle it to be used to create another ammo type.
---
You probably want to mention your platform. 
---
r/TalesfromAppalachia
---
Damnit forgot to mention that
---
White springs sucks. Do Chrelston or Monongah. Much better glowing ones. 
---
Do you have max rank fireproof? It really reduces the amount of damage explosive damage can do to you. Also having a dense mod on regular armor helps if you don't run power armor. If anything I would expect a nerf to low hp melee builds before the tse get another nerf
---
Fair enough. Vats head shots, any high rate of fire weapon. Four leaf clover like every other hit is a crit with a high fire rate weapon. Shot gun stagger builds   do the same thing especially if you mix in crits. As for cav its glitchy lately that's why there are so many peices up for sale lately. Since you know mechanics I won't go into all the other builds and details.
---
I got mine from one of the Train Station vendors, IIRC. I don't have the plans anymore (used them), but I can build them for you if you're on PC.
---
It’s the girls trapped in the fridge and in the closet at the airport that kill me. Just shattered. 
---
#whitespring gang
---
😂
---
Ps4
---
Yes please, need this badly.
---
OMG Beth is actually catering to our needs?
---
Sounds like you need to find a new way to play. Or don’t pvp if you don’t like dying and losing caps 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
TSE is pretty weak now that it’s been nerfed. I’m almost 99% sure the folks killing you are not even using TSE but those 3 letters are embedded in peoples brains as the gun that kills everyone.
---
Ah. Good luck. I’m XB1. 
---
Everything but the ears.
---
I appreciate that man but I'm on playstation. Thanks anyway though.
---
Then you must of grabbed them already or it's glitched ... https://imgur.com/a/h2GoIgd
---
Yeah... where *is* that? It's not the Whitesprings bunker...
---
Maybe a rumor and weapons dropped randomly too  to increase risk? 
---
Funny enough I'm in whitespring nuked right now 
---
Won’t it log you out after so long of no activity?
---
Yeah, every solution I can think of leads down the path of separate characters. As long as we can hop back and forth there will be ways to game the system.
---
FWIW, I would be perfectly fine having a one time switch from adventure to survival, kind of like survival mode in F04. 
---
I think bein passive in survival mode isnt wise at all
---
Take away perks, PA, all weapons except basic hand made style weapons. Force you to scavenge or make stim's, bullets from trash collected. 
---
Elements, creatures, other players can kill.
---
It would be like walking out of vault 76, level one straight into whitesprings.
---
Nope I seen people be afk for probably 2 hours so I can probably stay afk for 5 
---
Im honestly not trying to be rude when I ask how you dont know how to kill sent assasin at that many hours. My previous comment is how it works to the T. I can post a screenshot of a 43 kill streak leaderboard if you dont believe me. I run a vats crit build and with level 2 four leaf clover i bank a crit every 4-6 times i get a hit with auto weapons which is basically everytime i fire. combined with level 2 better criticals I do 30% more crit damage and it only takes 3-4 tiks of the gun fire to kill any cav or sent armor
---
I friended you, I’ll get there as soon as I can
---
Odd ball bloodied weapons are my fav! My bloodied Bowie and bloodied pool stick are my go to weapons when roaming. You don’t need the craziest 3 star DCG or Grog axe or super sledge for whacking mobs around. 
---
So that's a no, eh? 🤔
---
Shame. Good luck on finding them.
---
K
---
I mean sure lol.
---
Oh, I haven't been down there yet, don't have the clearance through the Enclave yet
---
It's what I was hoping it would be for some time
---
I don't play survival mode. I play adventure mode. They should further separate the two modes.
---
My counter is to avoid them. 
---
But we probably don't play the same way. Im not a min/maxer, I'm not super into Pvp, and I don't have the time to grind out legendaries or the caps to afford those expensive sets.
---
I just get by and do my own thing, and when someone comes along with all that high end gear and blows me to bits, I just curse under my breath and 2 minutes later I have forgotten the entire thing happened.
---
What ammo do you need. I've been dropping everything I don't use by the 1000's. Once I reach a 1000 rounds of something i don't use then I drop it all at the train station. I only use .45, shotgun and .50cal. Everything else gets dumped so if you want it let me know. 5mm and .308 fills up fast. I don't even pick up .38 or .44 anymore. 
---
That's what I was thinking of too, consumable/one time server transfers from PVE to PVP servers are nothing new to games so they could try that, although a lot of times they lead to the community being too split so they end up having to merge.
---
Why? 
---
Its just cheesing, that takes no effort or skill.
---
Sorry, dont see the point.
---
Same as battle bots. I have a ton of hornwright bunker cards from doing this event and they don’t even stack in my inventory. Just keeps growing every time I do it and I can’t drop these mofos
---
Thanks. I PM'd you.
---
I feel ya. 
---
It was removed from player camps during the the beta as players were reportedly abusing them to spawn in locations you could not normally reach.
---
Yes, I have that neat base near the golf course that always spawns me in the irradiated pond with the Mirelurks
---
Yes full looting weapons armor notes and all lol, craft sleeping bags for mobile spawn points and we golden.. itll be wars of pipe guns!!
---
So is being afk or cheating it took me skill to find this spot and it will take them skill to find me I am afk waiting for death I am EVEN RIGHT NEXT TO A FUCKING FAST TRAVEL POINT
---
Not on PC. 
---
Agreed-- as of tonight I think I'm done with Biv's dailies.  
---
Today I get "Test my agility under the effects of Rad Ant Lager." Again-- did this one a few days ago..  
---
Went to the teapot event. One ant spawned. One. Traveled to Thunder Mountain Substation get more Ant Meat (and Deathclaw). Got it... grab some corn, craft lager. Put in Fermenter. Wait. Wait Wait.  
---
Grab crafted Rad Ant Lager. Find a place where I can land a sneak attack. Drink. Do a sneak attack. Doesn't register. Do two more... they do not register.  
---
Run to find something else I can sneak attack. Alcohol effects run out.  
---
Log out for a while... try it again. Had to switch servers \*four\* times to find enough live/lootable ants... but 4 Deathclaws.  
---
Go back to camp to craft... forgot about the corn-- my fault. Fast travel and back for corn. Craft. Put it in the fermenter. Wait wait wait (I've been waiting while writing this post.) It's about 75% fermented.  
---
Hopefully my sneak attack actually registers this time... but... even so, this is more irritating than the Charleston DMV quest. I need to get off of the daily booze routine to restore my sanity.  
---
I'll leave it up to those who enjoy it.
---
Then-- what--
---
Where--
---
o_o
---
Usually I get on pretty well in PVP, even to the point of taking out the more common one shot builds recently, (the death claw gauntlet wielding, 3 star armor wearing ones, you know what I mean).
---
It's not the PvP I have a problem with, and I think the system gets more hate than it should, but when they don't even need to aim and can spray what feels like 500 nukes, localized directly into my chest, in about 3 seconds worth of fire rate, and then the game decides that spawn points shouldn't matter and don't even give me the option to spawn elsewhere, simply returning me to their death pit, that is what I have a problem with 
---
u/Aten_Ra more bugs to verify and track.
---
I've seen the short scope do what you have seen, but on the lever action. Re-aiming fixes it for me.
---
What do you mean counter stealth boys with mentats?
---
I just got the excavator paint and I really like it! No more looking like a school bus haha
---
So I’m not crazy! I swore I had seen one before but then could never find it!
---
Are you the guy on Seneca Rocks on Xbox?
---
And also I am showing Bethesda that being afk will ruin this game mode I am really helping them
---
Thank you. I didnt know how to tag him. 
---
And yeah it fixes as soon as you auto aim but ut really sucks to happen at all in heavy combat. Probably why it hasnt been posted before but if they can fix it it would be nice. 
---
I saw one yesterday.  It occasionally pops up at Raider vendors, of which Sutton Station is one, in addition to Vendor Bot Phoenix.
---
I use rifleman perks 6/9 and I kill ppl pretty well even some serumed up sentinel armor guys. That and my reg guass rifle for long range
---
The vendors in whitesprings and the whole 1400 shared caps being allocated to all of the vendors. What a great QoL improvement!
---
I have noticed auto respawns lately which doesn’t seem normal. Each death used to require selecting respawn and choosing a location. But lately hitting respawn just auto spawns you near by, or in your case on the spawnmatt with the guy waiting for you. 
---
People seem to know this and are exploiting it
---
For the scope one that happens for me on my combat shotgun
---
Nope at the top of the giant crane drill thing at the ash zone 
---
Thanks, guess I'll keep looking! 
---
Survival is name of the game mode. Even more so I have the most kills without dying showing that I'm not just building C.A.M.P.S leeching off the boosted EXP.
---
I'm done congrats you got your first win against a PVP player good job
---
That is usually my solution as well, but when they come and take my factory, when they insult me over messages I just get really agitated, don't think straight and just keep running back in, even after I calm down and approach stealthily, all they have to do is crouch and spray their 1 hit kill 1000 round per minute weapon with splash damage in the same cardinal direction that I happen to he in to them and I'm dead.
---
In all honesty I just wanted to help my friend out,and it ticked me off that I couldn't do anything to stop them.
---
I’m level 210 and haven’t completed main story quest yet. 
---
Launched my first nuke like 10 days ago. 
---
Good points op, I am back to eating spoiled food because it is easier and quicker than wasting time selecting food that is about to spoil, never mind sorting spoiled food puts it at the bottom of by huge list of food ..
---
This is spot on. I failed the first time, and was failing the second when I realized it was deliberately difficult so I ran. Was a good storytelling moment.
---
Lol. No. It does exactly as intended. Punishes you for dying. The higher your level the more you should be prepared and geared up. 
---
So play smarter, and don't die. You have to completely rewire the "dying means nothing" mindset of Adventure mode. 
---
I'm confident it wasn't like this in the past, but I agree, the last time I did it, it made me go to the Cow Spots Creamery and get the password again.
---
legendary vendor isn't until May 23rd. Going to be a bit of a wait.
---
It is random, went to sell 22 stimpacks and got killed and dropped 3. 22 nets me 198 caps from vendors and I've gathered ALOT since survival started lol
---
That’s childish and r/fo76 isn’t the place 
---
I've never done battle bots, I don't think I've ever seen it on the map. Where is that event?
---
Has anyone reported the gatling gun sight yet? It's horrendously annoying, that it's off to the side..
---
Yeah, that's cause I'm meant to be a stealth sniper, I can handle myself usually, but when they can pepper the entire area with shots that can kill me just by hitting near me, and I can't even seem to land a shot on them, it seems relatively unfair to me, why even have the other effects in the game if you are going to add something so insanely superior with to no negatives?
---
Played fine today on two Xbox X's .. could be your xbox .. what do you have ? Make sure you clear your cache.
---
So it's not locked to that specific gun and is an issue with the short scope. Ty for the info 
---
That sounds very fun, and I would sound very angry. Maybe if we get private servers, we could do something similar.
---
Oh man the first time I saw a pack of 3 scorchbeasts, they were fighting a level 50 Alpha Mirelurk Queen. There were 2 level 50 Scorchbeasts and a level 80, and the mirelurk queen killed them with about 45% hp left.
---
I'll look into the Fireproof, thanks for the tip
---
Berry Mentats. They counter Stealth Boys. They allow you to see living targets even if they're invisible. 
---
For me, I've been able to kill the Sentry Bot, and then just run up and use the Alpha and Beta keycards.  It never asks me to retrieve them again, although I concede, I think I have multiples of them.
---
Username Speechify is able to kill in two shots. I thought that wasn’t allowed?
---
I think I actually have a long scope on for accuracy and scouting. I mostly hip fire shotguns. So sniper scopes in general.
---
Worth it.
---
I saw someone post about it once. Ty for posting it here. Hopefully this post gains traction and Bethesda sees it. 
---
I think they are included in the Advanced Power Connectors plan.  It's sold for relatively cheap at vendors like Watoga, Phoenix, Harper's Ferry.
---
You are correct they are!
---
Dude survival is the best part right now, real risk and alot of fun. Survival ain't no blunder they jus making it right for some of us
---
Thanks for killing me friendo!
---
+Karma
---
no.trade.option appearing when trying.to.trade with someone...cant look at vendor items to.check the stats anymore..killing legendaries and finding no legendary item on them..the list goes on lol
---
Exactly, but for a heavy weapons build it's difficult to aim lol
---
My Xbox is fine on every other single game in all prior instances including today, with 100 gb internet to boot.
---
This^^^
---
Agreed, private servers would be perfect.
---
I love the Fallout world but I just think the perks, weapons, armour and amount of supplies take away the challenge. 
---
Here's hoping.
---
I believe that's Ohio.
---
Perhaps another location on the map could take its place?
---
If we ever get private servers, and you play on PS, you should hit me up.
---
The only advantage to this is resetting your DOOM counter.
---
What does your comment add to my thread, a suggestion made obviously not for a person like you but you still came in and said your opinion (which yes a opinion is valid) but when I say that it's not something I was "pitching" for lack of a better word wasn't something for you you get mad at me?
---
It would be like seeing and ice cream store open and walking in and shouting "I DON'T LIKE ICE CREAM" 
---
I'm not going to downvote you or whatever cause you're not trolling or anything just seems like a miscommunication or something.
---
Agreed.

why is it so hard to understand specific words? [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/survival](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/survival)
---
are you one of these people who autistic screams for getting killed in an online pvp game, am i right?
---
Someone may have reset it on you. Took me a couple tries too 
---
Me too! Maybe not exactly as I suggested, but there are plenty of great ideas that have spawned because it collectively.
---
Wow. You really showed me I guess
---
Very wise proverb, is that Seneca?
---
If someone else was doing the quest, and got a generated code after you but before you input yours it will reset on that server to their code. 
---
I'm with you that. I'm starting to get bored of them. Plus the corn and such tends to spoil quite fast now. I have resorted to using a know lvl character for the level up while wearing a beer hat and such 
---
You must be roo socialist to understand...
---
Yeah - it's not always there.  I don't know if it's a first-come-first-serve kind of thing, or if its presence is random to begin with.  I typically end up hitting R&amp;G Station everyday, and during Fasnacht week, I'd hit Sutton Station too.  I had only seen it once or twice.  There are numerous Raider vendors (Sunnytop Station, Pleasant Valley Station and the lodge, Sutton Station and R&amp;G Station).
---
Great, you're welcome :D
---
to think... 1400 caps just waiting for me in one location
---
can't wait to sell my stockpiles of glowing meat steak
---
I thought the event was well done. I loved the event and I love the game but I didn't want to be such a fanboy. 
---
I have given up quickly on the rare masks and just was happy to get a full set off plans on my main and effigies on my 3 alts. 
---
I had seen someone marching alongside the robots swinging their tambourine early in. I happily stole that whenever I was on a character with one, otherwise I just jumped around like an idiot. 
---
I also gave up on the megasloth and focused on the stingwings and wolves. 
---
I definitely hope for more activities as such sprinkled throughout the year. Every couple of months would be about right but seeing as there is no official release next week I'm hoping for a surprise April fools event. 
---
Alrighty, champ 
---
Follow up comment regarding your statement that you don't need more than 100 of something. I fundamentally disagree. 
---
As it stands, I consume more than what I personally need to help players out, including making sets of gear for friends. To do that requires that you have  more than 100 of something lying around. I try to at least keep 150-200 of important crafting materials around, but I still run out of that stuff. 
---
However, the biggest point against only needing 100 of anything is the upcoming player vending improvements. Once that hits crafting weapon and armor mods, as well as bulk crafting mats will be viable, and to keep your store going you will need a lot of materials, plus storing the items that are up for sale themselves.
---
I think once it didn't make me go get the password again, but it was a fluke. 
---
yeah I was out of ammo and broke my melee weapon while fighting it had to punch it at the final stretch. 
---
Same, dude. I have about 333 hours on one character. I didn't even think about getting inspirational until level 100 or so... So I'm level 105 or so with 333 hours in. Kind of an F
---
&gt; new functional camera
---
How functional will it be? People hardly ever talk about it.
---
The achievement should unlock rare teddy bears decorations for our CAMP.
---
I spawn inside deep water every time, usually get a disease by the time it’s done loading.. which is weird because I always found them hard to get, must be a dirty river. Love my camp but I hate having to put on a hazmat suit to go there!
---
So basically, get the cards then the code then head straight to the keypad, thanks.
---
wow, did I ever say I didn't know how to play?  I know what to do, my point is, for like the fucking hundredth time, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
---
I messed up my perk specs when we first got to the site so I died like 3x because I wasn’t Spec’d right. Doh!
---
I will try this!!!
---
if its that much of an issue with the servers to keep track of just ammounts of junk, i guess it would be the only way, other than just buying another account to keep it on
---
booooring, what were they thinking? 'hey guys you know how most players log in just to travel to vendors and sell stuff once a day? lets make it so that task takes 5 minutes'
---
Naw man no offense taken, although I'm not sure  how you got the impression that I dont know how to kill them. I have been running a melee cavalier Assassins build so people in sentinal have never been an issue. On top of that i have not run into one person in all my hours that can even come close to killing me. Now it's instadeath. Maybe none of the griefers I have been hunting down have had a proper vats crit build. Totally possible.
---
But i would figure at some point that I would at  least come across at  one person that knows what they are doing. 
---
Can you vats them?
---
How many tech data's do you need to finish it. I feel like I've done it a hundred times. At least 5 times a night when playing. When does it end 
---
I wonder if the faction bots at Whitesprings will sell PA mod plans. It's not like all the vendor bots do. 
---
I kind of hoping there's a sub basement for them, the raider vendor is going to be so oit of place otherwise. 
---
My last location by the river, I would nearly always arrive underwater.  Lol
---
Really?   I probably should have done it at a lower level then.
---
If they had lucky maxed, their crits could have been instantly refilling. 
---
I think I either dropped Lucy’s note or stashed it and had to refetch the pass
---
My Instigating Super Sledge in FO4 was called *The Fuckager,* after "The Wreckager" from Fable II. Figured a brute weapon like a rocket-powered sledgehammer ought to have a more blunt name.
---
i love the owl mask, i didnt get the old man or whatever the pale one with weird hair was called
---
Just like eating an elephant, one bite at a time.
---
(I don't think this is what you are saying)Are you saying that Bethesda could not program a toggle to only target hostiles? Or are you saying (How I read you comment) is that it was a problem in FO4 that you relate with?  . My oppinion is that the real time vats should have taking this into consideration, considering that it was an issue in FO4 with stop time.  QOL
---
Probably the icon pic for fasnestnchet day 
---
Did you get a lot of plans?
---
How much should I expect to pay for an AAE?
---
theyre not going to fix it. its been 6 months.
---
Its not a huge deal but found my first behemoth was very excited got him down to slither of health away from death I was outta stimpacks and every hit he does was about a stimpack of health went to hit him.... no damage thats fine its happened before I went to hit him again.... still no damage he then kills me lost my junk no stimpacks left to fight him again and was at a workshop so no respawn near me
---
Reading title i downvoted. Reading post, i changed it to an upvote. I'm not into survival, but anything that seems to make the game better can have my vote.
---
how about they fix the main game first before creating another mode thats also broken and focusing on that pile of dogshit.
---
And now banned once again it seems
---
Exactly this. You want to balance PvP, just make it where everyone will be afraid to lose their best gear. Make everything lootable. 
---
*Also* I believe they could add a target enemies only mode .(From a programmer stand)
---
I hope they also put that a player vending machine that we can be use to browse the server’s inventory of goods without traveling to individual camps- 
---
Could use a item delivery fee to offset how useful it will be and encourage camp visiting
---
I'm hoping I get to display the jarred scorch head at Morgantown Airport... And the other jarred scorch parts as well as the trumpet, harmonica etc 
---
Absolutely 
---
Players with a bounty are the exception to no killing.  They can be killed w/o penalty.  
---
My favorite ghouls are the ones that drop 3 pair of different chems. At least they went out doing what they loved.
---
Looking for marsupial and twisted muscles
---
Always have tons of chems after killing ghouls
---
I play on Xbox. Nearly all the time I'm in a party chat with my friends. Came across a couple of other ladies through my friends. One is even in her 60's and I find it a joy playing with her :)
---
Yeah. Get your cards... and make sure before you jump to generate your code that the door hasnt been opened and no one is near that map point. It's a hefty caps cost to fast travel around but I checked the door first, jumped to generate the code, then fast traveled back to the door as fast as I could while watching the map as much as I could. 
---
Wait, by any chance do you think that cap inventories are shared between players? Bc that’s not true.
---
Yeah that megasloth was so sketchy. It took me awhile to figure out I just leave the area (go up the hill) and come back and the frozen sloth is raidable
---
Oh gesh I forgot about that. Although nothing for st. Pattys day and I expected green lights
---
I’ll buy it for 750 if you still have it
---
I can make you a marsupial one for 3 fiberglass, 5 oil, 1 stable crimson flux, one ultracite. If you wanna donate your known plans or unwanted legendaries I would take that too!
---
Soon whitespings will not be the hot spot for nukes. It's already tremendously buffed as it is. Why waist a nuke on that place anymore. 
---
Persistence is everything
---
So far i have put in 771 hours into this game
---
It may just be the scopes that basically have their own animation. My other scopes are absolutely fine but the short scope, and your long scope, fill the whole screen right? 
---
Yeah pretty much
---
Lol, I'm assuming they will take over some of the shops in the hallway that are pointless, like the 5 outfit shopsnor the spa and barber shop.
---
And, please let me bulk everything! Why can't I bulk gold, silver, ballistic, asbestos...
---
FFS I just found over 500 asbestos in my stash.
---
It’s white springs from the other side, looking out. 
---
I did it at level 50 and wasn’t spec’d or had good gear. Relived when I can out at drop sit 9. 
---
On the 26th would have been the free PVP emote I believe 
---
Seems like this would solve the issue of moving stuff between alts.
---
r/imsorrimisjudged
---
I had my base up on the cliff with the black titanium deposit to the left of Ella Ame's bunker. Every other time I would fast travel to it, I would end up at the bottom of the cliff next to the small house near the cliff.
---
travel won't be an issue except to get the cards/codes (my camp is right down the road from the place). How do you know if the doors been opened or not (it shuts after a short while)
---
I have everything but the flux. If you’re looking for legendaries in place of it I have a Vampiric .50 MG if that’s worth it.
---
Yes that method may not be full proof, i used that for a Deathclawawhile back, but the last two deaths were both while the CAMP item was clear of obstructions..
---
As its a cat hes teathered close to the CAMP so i've gone against the rule for this Cat as i want him inside and well protected :)
---
u/aten_ra the collect holotape games challenge is also bugged. 
---
If been exploring the map and there is a lot of potential for additions and events. I'm interested in what the end of the year doc will bring! Most ambitious doc yet sounds fun!
---
What if you're a level 200+ player who has no caps, no aid on you? You drop nothing, they get no caps when they kill you? 
---
And make it so items don't respawn! Once you take that dog bowl and use it for plastic, it's gone forever
---
I’m not talking about Biv, I’m talking about the daily challenges 
---
The very upper left corner of the map has a lumber mill just swarming with super muties
---
If we can put it at a workshop, it should function at the CAMP too. BETHESDA PLS
---
They appear often at harpers ferry as not many people go there to trade with the bot.
---
That fully depends on what the player chooses; as a trader, you need more materials. Therefore as the developers made it you can specialize in weight reduction rather than damage. You build things and should specialize in things that help that. Without players specializing, everyone would end up at end game with the same perk deck. Also, no one is supposed to be able to do everything, thats why specials have limits. We both agree upon stash needing increased. 
---
Good lord what did you do to the poor guy.
---
They did the same shit with radios for some goofy reason. Took em away, now they gave em back, they could do the same thing to the mats, I wager.
---
I mean, easy solution is to just move your mat somewhere else, it'd be fine
---
Inb4 "GaMe GlItChEd AnD UsEd AlL mY CaPs On A bOuNtY" post.
---
The radioactive flora and radioactive materials there are pretty bae, plus there's limited shrubbery so unlike some other places you won't lose dead bodies in the grass. Makes a huge difference.
---
\#4 Is what I follow extremely just due to playing other survival games, this is one strategy that will save your life every time and as well as get the drop on someone not following that strategy, which is imo, majority of the time. It's easier to go down a road because it's quicker access to where you want to go, but in the meantime, people on the outskirts can spot you immediately. Hard lesson learned in DayZ, H1Z1, PUBG, Etc.
---
There there, OP. Show us on the doll where Todd and Pete touched you. 
---
Just stared legendaries, but still. Spent three hours looking, only found two. Guess I have to hope someone sells one of those weapons to a vendor.
---
Scrap syringers to learn the plans. The fly one is pretty fun to me with peeps. Plus it counts as tagging. 
---
Are you on PC? If so, you can change the colours for all of that in the .ini file. 
---
When I open my fermenter, at the bottom it says "Mark items for display in your camp" (something very close to that) .. we can't display anything yet but we will be able to soon, however I thought I'd mention it
---
When modding a chainsaw it gives the option to make a SCOPE lol
---
I just paid 5k for an aae hunting rifle. I've seen handmades and lever actions go for like 8-12k. A bit spicy for me but probably worth it 
---
Didn't have much trouble with that on my second character. Food/chems issues only really happen when you don't know the game well.
---
Kinda hoping that Nuclear Winter will be more hardcore survival, where you don't have effectively unlimited food and purified water, and meds aren't 90% sale goods.
---
This, I constantly try to stay on a server as long as I can just so I can manipulate factories with resources without the looming threat of a hostile takeover. That ammo ain't gonna make itself.
---
You're a sniper you shouldn't be inside in a building trying to fight someone anyway
---
That sounds good to me. PS4 AndrewMosier. No mic at the moment. Just join me at my camp. We will throw everything in a nearby box because I hate going through the trade window, especially with no mic.
---
Thx bruh I have a handmade...I actually expected ur prices to be reversed..I thought AAEs went for upwards to 20k..I'm in the market..I'm buying two outfits..and then the next big purchase will be an AAE..I'm a rifle build 
---
Sounds like you hit the honey hole. Gotta say I'm jealous
---
Yeah I did exactly what you said, absolutely no loot on any bot around the resort. That's weird.
---
Thanks. I can’t look at my current farming locations for a while!
---
No, but in a dark setting popping one of these will come in handy. Stealth Boy users are extremely dangerous in the dark and areas where there's lots of grass. Popping one of these may not give you vats capability, but it will give up their position and provide you with a better advantage.
---
I typically build on bridges so that I can use the bridge for one type of structure and under the bridge for something else. Sometimes it's like doubling your usable camp area. I'm currently working on building a new structure on top of a bridge, but I have my workshop area perfectly situated underneath. And it took forever to make it so I am disinclined to move it.
---
Fighting the Scorchbeast Queen is the only time my game freaks out enough that it crashes and it's really frustrating. Burning a lot of ammo just to get a crash really sucks 
---
I couldn't have said it better. 
---
I definitely will appreciate this on my main, but overall I'm not for it.
---
I have a new character, almost level ten, and I had to do a long walk being extremely careful not to agro level 62+ bad guys so I could trade at whitesprings.
---
That effort and hunt is part of what I love about the game, it limits what I can earn daily if I only have three vendor areas found but that is part of the struggle.
---
Now I will just camp at the clubhouse and crank out hats to sell...
---
I could've sworn there was a fast travel mat. I saw it just the other day...
---
You can also use the mister handy saw (I might be wrong on what it’s called sorry) to chop it up into a meat pile and then it’s lootable 
---
I would say you can earn Whitespring tokens for killing people who have a bounty.
---
That place sucks for Flora except yellow cake. It's everywhere. All the others are sparse. Monongha. And Charleston are better for glowing ghouls now. 
---
Stealthboys are absolutely terrible. You should not be able to attack and be invisible while moving. They should be invisibility scrolls
---
If everyone had to start over for survival mode the servers would only be populated by the people who started the first week and played that exclusively. 
---
I like the idea of going back to adventure mode getting some caps, ammo or whatever you need then going back to survival.
---
yea see im lucky my deathclaw stays inside right next to the camp thing and doesnt move i dont really want him to fight stuff he's just for looks
---
Damn I got pretty excited then I saw you are on Xbone. Oh well. I'm on PC or I'd hire ya
---
The vendor in grafton, the second one, not the train station, has all the excavator plans all the time. He also sells the lever gun 100% of the time for me
---
Same thing is happening to me.
---
The ammo cans are a bit broken. They should scale the quantities in a similar way to ammo creation, so you don't get 10 plasma cores and five 50cal rounds.
---
Usual rule with heavy weapons is to stick to a Gatling or flechette-modded Harpoon Gun for ammo saving, and reserve the expensive guns (minigun, 50cal, energy gatlings) for the tougher fights. Lucky Hole Mine is great for lead, and the Scrapper perk gives you a ton of steel now.
---
It's intended so people dont spam stealth boys stimpacks and other aid. You can do it of course if you like to role play as a pinata. 8 or 9 purified water and food respectively.  2 super stims and 4 reg stims. And one or two rounds of chems you need. Let other players provide the rest or visit your camp when you need more.
---
You, my friend, made me snort with laughter. The image of someone running along with that head flopping made my night.
---
Just TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
---
Please invite me and I promise I won't attack you? I've been trying to farm Charkeston Junkyard all day and keep getting attacked every time.
---
Animal friend 3 and wasteland Whisperer 3 - Abbys Bunker , head south along the road theres the Wendingo Tree ( its a tree where wendingos always spawn you can't miss it )  just past that is a burnt out Car , run from the Bunker to the Cr and back,, theres 3 random spawns along there, i got the Cat by the Car.
---
Parameters still exist , Cat was a random spawn at the location :)
---
Ah shoot! Well if you ever have any questions, reach out on discord! I’ve helped a few people design a base on pc 
---
those perk cards!!! please! and a cooler or fridge for food since it spoils so fast in real time even when logged out.
---
I just need to set up the 3 junk resource so I can farm the mods for the lever action gun :(
---
&gt; I don't even understand what you are saying, 
---
You could actually read more than the last reply if you're having trouble following.
---
&gt; the point is once you reach the top three that's it, no more questing for you... 
---
And your proposal is to remove the leaderboard.  So you will never be found if you're careful.
---
Which means you're avoiding 99.9% of the risk of Survival mode, while reaping the large rewards for Survival mode.
---
Which is a problem.  The game needs some mechanism so that you are taking a risk commensurate with the rewards.  Which is why Bethesda put the top 3 on the map.  If you don't like this, you can't just nerf the risk alone.  You also have to nerf the reward.
---
As for "no more questing", just fast travel to your camp, dump your aid and junk in your stash, fast travel to a train station.  Wait.  You will be at the bottom of the leader board very quickly and can return to questing.
---
I tend to swap back and forth between a few weapons that use different ammo types. I don’t think that’s ideal, but I also highly dislike the chores of farming lead, ballistic fiber, and the like.
---
You have to factor in the damage being dealt out.  Bobble heads, chems, perks all of those can equal crazy amounts of damage. 
---
I've hit 3000 damage with my TSE dragon after the nerf just to see how high I could get it
---
Thanks!
---
I can make speed demon too if you're interested.
---
Same here, i like that they make ur base feel more homely :)
---
White Springs last vendor on left had them and I recently saw them at Watoga, (I'm assuming you mean the neon ones and yes they're expensive!)
---
This, filled with lower-level supermutants. Especially since I barely ever see anyone in or near that area.
---
what if you are deaf? or mute? no text chat with very poor emotes (for communicating) makes a large portion of the game inaccessible for some.
---
No damage resistance that’s why you die 
---
Sounds like a great game your developing. I think I like this one better though. Let me know when your done coding your entirety new game I might check it out.
---
Half the challenge is deciding what you're going adventuring as. Am I crafting? Gathering? Farming low level mobs for ammo? Farming high level legendaries for weapons? Have I been attacked by other players repeatedly this session? 
---
You can't viably swap your perk cards in combat. You would die.
---
You pretty much said "please turn this game into FO4 online" lol
---
Will that is only around 50% each time
---
353 --&gt; 170
---
170 --&gt; 85
---
But yeah it's silly really though you should only go in with 10 at the most
---
Probably just by the way you worded your question my bad but yeah man maybe its the system you play on? On xbox everyone around my level is running these type of builds so its just a matter of whos faster to react. I run sent assassin and I still get melted on the regular but at the same time a really good team can make a huge difference 
---
My name is Marc, you pointless scrub of a human.
---
I think they need to up the bar on their regular events so they draw more people to them.
---
Just regular old events that happen on a daily basis should be fun and rewarding and draw people in.
---
Explosive guns are not that really over powered now. With the right build it definitely helps but it's not that powered considering my mele weapon can get upword 2000 damage and my bloody 1* shotgun does way more damage than my "not bloody" TSE pump. Both with maxed shotgunner perks. The bloody wins it but I'm not gonna go into survival knowing it only takes one shot to kill me. I just can't afford the good armor so I'll stick with the boy scout mode and keep all my caps and aid. 
---
My bet is they replace the existing vendors.
---
Putting sentinel and assassin into one armor is just one of their many mess ups. It’s like having a bloodied two-shot. Power Armor doesn’t have any legendary effects and can only have one mod while those magic armors can stack three. What a joke in a ‘survival’ setting, are they trying to tell us the military wearing those PA were cannonfodders. This definitely needs to be balanced. 
---
This is the reason im trying to rearrange my stash and use aid in adventure mode and when im low enough that I can stash a good amount of it and im lower on caps than right now then ill try my main in survival.
---
This is why servers seem so inactive sometimes
---
Yes, I moved my camp from the top of the world just to stop having to walk up the mountain
---
Ok so spoilers here... but there are two doors in the basement. You walk past the first, which the key is behind, to go to the one that is near the key cards that has the keypad behind it.
---
So if you go to the overlook house first, make sure that door in the first room of the basement is NOT open. If it is, someone on that server has already gotten the key. If its closed, and you have your cards, THEN you fast travel, generate the code at Ingram mansion, then fast travel back to the overlook house immediately, go to the key card area, open the keypad, and put your code in to open the other door. 
---
I had to server hop about 30 times to find one where that first door was closed. You can not server hop after you generate the code as the code is tied to that server and will reset. 
---
Mabye there  was someone else at your bases location. Go to where the base is and see if anything’s there.
---
what happens when u aleeady stashed a good amount of technical.data before the quest.
---
I’d love to see the events add a more friendly competitive edge to them.  How many mole miners can you kill in uranium fever. How fast can you reset the robots in fertile soil. 
---
Even making standard nukes an event. 15 minutes and who ever kills the most get X. 
---
How could someone be at my base when I can't place it? 
---
If were adding bugged challenges, the ones for finding locations is bugged too. I've already gotten all map points but they wont complete. As are a whole lot of other challenges but I'd have to make a list. Some like kill robots with melee etc. 
---
FYI cloth and acid makes gunpowder is good quantities at a chem station
---
!isLogical
---
If Shub Niggorath is there then Nyarlathotep isn’t far behind. 
---
idk what your talking about, if they dont have armor and they're at 10% health you can one tap them, its the armor that's annoying, or maybe your build is just really bad for pvp  ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
The specific alchohol ones suck. But the just intoxicated ones are ok. As long as I dont have to chug 50 alchohol for a daily challenge im good. 25 is more than enough I think 5-10-15 is acceptable for daily challenges and 20+ unit consumption challenges for weeklies.
---
This please 
---
I like that idea, that could be fun.
---
Yeah, its unfortunate man. I don't have any friends that play this so I'm left with messaging half the server in a private message to join back to the nuke I went through the trouble of launching.
---
When you log on does it say it can’t be placed or or  the C.A.M.P is red when you put it down. You will get a message when you are banned, you’ll know.
---
Playing with my friends, guarding merchant camps, and doing quests.
---
I just sent a request, I just got the fluxes required in the last ten minutes lol. 
---
I would hold on to them and wait. Since those items are in the atom shop until more items rotate out, they will be around longer. I tend to wait and see if any limited items come out that you really want and won’t have to regret missing out on them.
---
that door (the one that requires the keycards to open) closes after a short while (1:30- 2 mins iirc)
---
Cool. No worries.
---
The camp is green. Multiple other people are having the same issue.
---
 I am definitely not banned. It's a bug. 
---
Is this close enough to water? It's on the far west of map though.
---

Welp, I guess this community doesn’t like when people ask questions! Message received!

the password is 748250
---
Well, technically, you could say I waited for him to spawn at Vault 76, waved to him, and then killed him seemingly to his surprise.
---
you on xbox? i want to see this with my own eyes its that unbelievable
---
I love how we just decide to knock out all the glass on windows after we just build them. Why don't they just add two variants for a wall with broken glass and a wall with pristine glass.
---
I did that and it still brings me back to first person.
---
Ok. That makes sense. If you care that much about having the game run smooth without bugs go ahead and stop playing the game while they get everything fixed.
---
That's the way it's meant to be
---
No it’s been part of the game for a long time. If you don’t like being hit with vats counter it. Use a stealth boy or cryo weapons to drain thier ap. Removing vats from PvP is like removing PA from pvp just because you don’t know how to counter something and just keep running out in the open rather than being behind cover is your own fault. 
---
yea I get that, since I don't have anyone to play with either I usually just switch games or something for a while.
---
I really want to beat the Queen but at this rate who knows when that'll happen
---
Pro tip: get the Fireproof perk to level 3 and the SBs won't hurt much.
---
I am definitely not rebuilding my entire base just to have this happen when I log in again like the other guys. 
---
Bethesda can kiss my ass. 
---
I suggested that they add a contribution bar to the SBQ event. After she dies the event rewards the top 10 with more rewards 
---
Summersville (it's by the big lake, center map) 
---
Get rid of your known plans too. I think they weigh half a pound each I dropped 25 pounds the day I realized this.
---
I don't PVP but VATS seems like a fair game tool of you choose to participate. I'm open to compelling counterarguments though.
---
They actually had it in the game and then removed it for some reason. I still have mine sitting in my stored camp objects. [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/lcbErXP) is a pic for proof.
---
Your not being one shot. The Tesla rifle has a very high rate of fire. So even though it looks like your getting hit with one shot it’s actually 15-20 shots in very rapid succession all of which chain shoot as one constant bolt.  Which gets around the max damage per shot cap. 
---
Hmm....actually, fair enough. Originally I thought it was a stupid thing to remove, but I guess that's a fair reason to take 'em out.
---
I'll stop playing the game altogether. Plenty others will too. 
---
It does. By design. You have to have the key code before u swipe the cards. Swipe, run to the keypad and enter fast but correctly and then run out to the other door where the key is actually at. 
---
The door that holds the key stays open after someone has gotten the key so if you check overlook first, before generating your code, you can see if your server has already has the key taken or not. 
---
Exactly. I melee, so I just stay out of PvP. 😃
---
I can verify this. Really wish it was more consistent on getting loot and the EXP was shared. I believe that the more people in an area when mobs spawn, the higher the chance that you'll get 2 and 3 star enemies, so it's great to have multiple people farming together. Usually if I invite people and tell them to just keep up with me, I'll kill stuff, they get loot, tag what they can, they end up leaving after a few runs because they aren't getting exp. Feels bad.
---
That's not the entrance to any vault I recognize. It's underground, but not the one located in the Ash Heap. It's not the one up by red rocket, it's not the one in the Savage Divide or the new 51... 
---
Check in on the next MAJOR MAJOR update.
---
Great idea! Make it work like a vendor. Anything you put in it is removed from game, but you can always retrieve a copy from a list. Though it might only work for armor, clothes, weapons and other things you'd only need one copy of at a time. Probably need a cool down timer to avoid stressing the server.
---
I forget you can craft gunpowder. I usually have problems with lead.
---
"I didn't say that at all" -- in a thread that is literally about that.   
---
Dumbfuck\_the\_hypocrite. 
---
Sounds like an underground base :P kinda like mine 
---
B.I.N.G.O
---
One pool of 1400 instead of 7 pools of 200 each, it sounds like. In other words, if you're hauling 1400 caps worth of bulk junk, you can now drop it all with just one vendor, which is nice.
---
PERFECT!!!!!
---
Once taken its gorne, love it.
---
Sounds like you have a funky base, chat me later and see if I can’t help you with a work around.
---
The tesla gun does around 100 damage unmoded and it has a similar rate of fire to the combat rifle. Either you're on survival mode or you are wearing weak armour, because it takes around 10 shots of my tse lever action to kill a player wearing anything above combat armour and it does 213 damage.
---
I am sorry! I logged out before I saw your reply!
---
It's an ingredient in Steeped Fern Flower Tea, which gives you +2 strength.
---
Sorry Tehfook, Im one of the master-race on PC :)
---
Could never grasp fps with a gamepad.
---
Will be nice to have that extra time spent selling to actually play the game
---
Should just make it so anyone in your friends list or on your team within last hour or so can not clear or claim a bounty. 
---
Thanks, will have to look into it.
---
I still don't understand how the bounties work in Survival but someone claimed my bounty and said it was only listed as over 3,000 so he gave me back about half of that.
---
I have a TS but not explosive that I don't use. Planned to use it but can't learn the plans and I'm sick of crafting and scrapping. 
---
That depends if you're going to balance 2 weapons or dedicate to one style. When Queen fighting I'm fully carded for Heavy Weapons with the corresponding cards for it, but normally have a lot of 1 star cards for 30% boost giving me options while still getting a bonus.
---
If doing that its better to have 3 1* cards than 1x1* and 1x2* as its 5% less boost. 
---
I haven't died in survival yet so I haven't seen the option.
---
Never skip leg day!
---
A quarter pound each but still. It's  a lot
---
Unless the other day was beta, nah bruh 
---
I appreciate the offer but I have better things to do then chase down fixes for Bethesda's bugs. 
---
It is? Wow I didn't think scorched could spawn down there...
---
It was in the Beta. My Beta character still has one placed.
---
There are birds in the files.  
---
Crow, Owl, Seagull, Vulture.  
---
Why they aren't actually in the game, I don't know, and am very bummed about. An oops perhaps, where they were not added to the spawn list?
---
Well they need a supply and demand system that adjusts prices for things sold at vendors.
---
Even with all the misery the Wastelands have to offer, I actually things are better of after the bombs than before.
---
Those are the challenges where I toss a dime in a jar and pay myself to skip it.
---
How could you spawn somewhere you can't normally reach when you have to reach the spot to put down the mat?
---
Unfortunately it seems that they want it to be a grind so people play as many hours as possible even if there isn't enough content.
---
They don’t. I was outside of the bunker and Scorched-beasts spawned these guys and followed me all the way down there!
---
I thought you were stalking me for a sec then I realized you were OP.
---
I just want you to know, TSE guns absolutely suck, if you are running fireproof in Dense these guns do absolutely no damage. Assassins cav? Radiation and staggers. If you know you can’t win a battle, leave.
---
Whitesprings guarantees me a dashboard whether I launched or not. Like clockwork my team crashes 1 by 1 and we usually manage to cycle back into the game as the next goes down. We laugh and call it a Bethesda Feature, because it just works.
---
Your loss bud. 
---
Hope you have no luck with another game. 
---
Please stay gone this time. 
---
Yeah.  Acid’s my problem. I’ve read to setup an extractor for some, but I haven’t got around to it
---
Please, oh please, fix it so BoS combat plans are back in one of the vendors lists. 
---
i got the game right as it was ending, but i loved the event, it was the right kind of fallout humor
---
Thanks. That’s one of the few spots I haven’t explored. 
---
Eh there is always a work around. Lost my base today due to s bug, was able to get back underground and make it again.
---
I know how it feels 
---
Oh thats a good welcome into the game then!
---
Low health heavy in power armor. My Gatling gun does around 400 damage a bullet, enough to oneshot lots of things. 2shots supermutants (and I’ve got 3/3 Glow Sights- level 91 glowing death claw? Two bullets. )
---
Gatling gun may not have the raw DPS of the 50cal or the LMG, but it’s vastly more ammo (and repair) efficient. And when you’re at the point of 1-2 shorting mos things, you don’t often need raw DPS. 
---
I carry a ton of weapons, but I run 3/3 Bear Arms. I do have a bloodied Ripper as a “backup”, but honestly, it’s just for fun. Between my bloody Gatling gun, 50cal, twoshot missile launcher, Instigating autogrenade, bloody 25% fire rate LMG... I’m pretty happy. I haven’t even busted out the Furious plasma Gatling on a queen yet... soon, my precious.
---
Brilliant, this is exactly what the Factions wars they've talked about should be!
---
Maybe he could hire a part-time assistant? Probably not someone full-time because the benefits packages aren’t so great. 
---
I leave my purifiers unlocked so other players can have free, fresh water. Ditto the crops. 
---
That is really handy to know, thanks! 
---
4 times today although 2 times the game just froze. Guess it's getting better lol
---
I had more social interaction with people in the one week than I did the entire game...
---
Most memorable:  Drunk guy, LvL 30ish? Singing his own renditions of "fasnact day" in several different styles for the entirety of the 15 minute event. 
---
Placing bases is still tricky. All it takes it breaking the base down into smaller saved parts and placing them individually. It's really no big deal at all. 
---
I can see though that for someone with your delicate temperament, it would be a big deal. Best for you to move on. Maybe try Mario Cart or Candyland. 
---
Ok...just trying to figure it out as my cards are maxed but I wanted room for other perks like tank killer and stuff.  Thanks for the response.
---
This was a thing in FO4. There must be some reason why they omitted it in this version. I want it (as i typically fall about 80 ft every time I ft to my camp:/), but i have a feeling they aren't going to let it happen.
---
Rofl I think the best i heard was someone acting like Snoop Dogg
---
 So a week for me to do my rounds of selling confederate hats....
---
How to push away players so it’s a high level jerk circle, check.
---
It's been like this for a month or so. Make sure you store your bulked stuff so you don't need to rebulk it.
---
You can place foundations in in locations out of sight, too
---
Once I went through a Harper’s Ferry run, I had one  2\* and two 3\* legendary max level enemies. Dropped loot were shabby, though:(
---
Survival of the fittest.
---
That’s called vats buddy lol 
---
I mean, I’m only like level 18? But if I chose to play the high risk mode, where killing is expected, an i really in the wrong? 
---
I have a build that I feel is pretty well balanced across melee, rifle and shotgun. Most of my points are in strength, perception and intelligence.
---
Could just be drunk and tired in real life. 
---
Open weekdays till 8, Saturday and Sundays till 5, online at Dirty Doctor Co.com. 
---
Exactly, we aren’t in Ireland. Although wouldn’t it be cool to have a fallout game set in a different country for once? The perspective of say the communist Chinese or anyone else other than Americans?
---
So let us bulk everything, I want large vats of stimpack, rad-away, and psychobuff that I use to fill travel containers.
---
You should have went on to spawn killing him. That would have made you feel so much better
---
My bloody combat shotgun dwarfs my TSE pump with perks included. Plus I don't kill myself anymore lol. 
---
Noob question, but what od you do with them? Just drop them? If you do, you still "keep" the plans? 
---
For anyone else coming in from the googles, There is a small cave in whitesprings near the snake on the map that barring someone else killing it **always** has a sleeping yao guai in it.
---
Source: I lived next to that cave for three months, it's on the golf course near the popular junk extractor spot.
---
P.M.S.

Permanent Material Storage
---
I'm a woman, 25 and lvl 82, I had some kid tell me he was going to find me and rape me and then kill me  because he was screaming into the mic for no damn reason and I told him to please be quite so I could ask the rest of the group a question. 
---
No way it's too much a part of fallout and an rpg element of the game. I love the live version of fallout but it was an rpg once apon a time!
---
Pa sucks in pvp also this isnt a suggestion post, i just want to see what people think thats why i asked why OR why not
---
He actually tried to kill me again afterwards. Threw a Molotov and killed himself.  I had no intentions on repeatedly killing him, just playing the game and taking out targets if they become available 
---
Do you run with your cards at max? I run a similar build but want to move a point or 2 to endurance
---
I miss the days where developer would just release games and fans weren't THIS entitled to change things. You've created an entirely different game. Go play that one, and let them make Fallout. 
---
It would make the junk those vendors are selling actually worth something too. 
---
It sounds more like you want TDM than a survival mode. 
---
 I usually leave them in suitcases at train stations 
---
Wow that sucks. Hopefully they patch this ASAP. Are you on console or PC? 
---
Thanks man
---
I bought both the mat plans from a vendor and the welcome mat in the Atom store thinking this would happen. I spawn behind my camp every time, in the water, collecting rads.
---
I've done zero on them. In the Nuka shine quests Im still in the part where I need to drink it. I guess I will be teleported somewhere when I do. I haven't yet felt ready for it as I want to do my own things.
---
If Atom isn't your religion stop chasing and farming them. 
---
Much better to do just what you want.
---
Ok but its not they got that chance to fire, because i died within .3 secs 
---
Oh, so it was an icon? I thought it was an actual physical mask haha. I looked in the icon section and I do see this weird mask icon face. Must have been that. Thanks!
---
Good luck 👍🏼 
---
nah thats here till april 2
---
*Testers to devs:* Guys, we've discovered 2 big problems with the game.
---
*Devs:* Shoot.
---
*Testers:* So, apparently players can infinitely duplicate any item in the game and also some of those items can one-shot the biggest bosses in the game.
---
*Devs:* OK, no problem, let's just leave that one up to the honor system and we'll patch it in 2 months or so. What's the other issue?
---
*Testers:* Some guy used his welcome mat to get on top of the Red Rocket sign.
---
*Devs:* #WHAAAAAT!?! CALL THE TEAM, IMMEDIATELY! WAKE THEM UP IF YOU HAVE TO!!!
---
I think I claimed that on the 27th as that was the day of the update for Survival and when I first tried out the game a bit. The other poster mentioned and icon, which I saw in my store, so I think it was that.
---
Anyway, thanks for the heads up on that one too!
---
There's a mod for that
---
This is my overburdened dream. No need to trek around the map to hit vendors, I can start off from the Whitesprings daily or finish there. Love it.
---
That would make it too easy. 
---
Yeah that would be great! Don’t see why they couldn’t. Sadly there a too many other problems they have to handle so they probably won’t get around to this. But here’s hoping! 
---
500 caps?  
---
Yes sir! I also think a Continental style base would help people in Survival mode.
---
I quit the game shortly after release because of the 400 limit, then I came back once 600 was available and remember managing that for a long time, now I can't seem to stay below 700 and am usually maxed out.
---
It really shouldn't be a weight limit for the stash, it should be an item count limit, giving more incentive to bulk items for storage, and let us bulk absolutely anything that can stack and doesn't have a condition bar.
---

---
same dude i swear i saw it ingame (i think its for settlements only)
---
but my house is on a cliff too, its legit a tent and fast traveling to it spawned me off or inside of the cliff
---
Xbox one. Today after two attempts I got something. 
---
Maybe I'm thinking of workshops...
---
5 good tip, didn't know that, cheers
---
God that’s crazy. I’m on PS4 but I’m nervous to take her down now, haha. Going to try it out tomorrow. 
---
Be careful with this! With the latest update, moving your CAMP bench so that any of your structures are outside its radius causes the “a Fallout 76 update has prevented the placement of your camp” error to erroneously occur. I rebuilt my house 3 times before I realized what was going on. 
---
I beat the mission solo at level 25. It took multiple tries just to get through the first part of the underground area you go to, and I've never gotten so fucking pissed off at the game before like I did with that mission. The feeling when I finally completed that pain in the ass was amazing.
---
There are a few in Charleston
---
Funny how valuable wood suddenly became.
---
Good luck. 
---
Got that sweet -50% fall damage armors. My real issue is i end up underground half the time
---
I like it.  It's survival and the people who have survived the longest get targeted.  It's supposed to be dangerous.  Some other things like the cap rewards need balanced for sure, but I'm good with the leaderboard.
---
Mostly. In strength I have some of the weight reduction perks, but not maxed. I also only have 4 points in charisma for lone wanderer since I mostly play alone, I'll switch this out during my vendor run. Same in perception if I'm gathering a lot of meat or ingredients. I don't think all of my intelligence cards are maxed, but with those I focus on my power armor and weapon maintenance abilities. In Endurance I have fireproof and something I can't remember, fireproof is great though especially against scorchedbeasts and if you're using an explosive weapon up close. I'm pretty sure I took my luck down to two and have bloody mess. I haven't noticed any negative affects. I don't have it saved, but I could message you a pic of my loadout tomorrow if you want.
---
Another idea I've been having, I've been comfortable with my cards for a long time so I have 40ish lvl ups available. Sometimes when I get duplicate cards I'll combine them.for a lower version of a maxed card, just in case.
---
I'd play Fallout BR
---
&gt;The higher your level the more you should be prepared and geared up.
---
Wow what total bullshit. 
---
It's almost as bad as hearing "CONGRATULATIONS!!!" 😂
---
The weekly atom and daily challenges I believe. 
---
You do pretty much need to do the Biv ones daily to get the new drinks though.  Not much wiggle room on the drink 25 unique alcoholic beverages one.
---
make the debt account wide.
---
What heavy weapons do you use against the queen? I have a bloodied explosive Gatling but the dps isn’t very good against her compared to my super sledge. 
---
Ok...cool...I mean once you reach max level it's pretty much all you can do is move perks or points around and play with different builds. Thanks for responding.
---
Yea I still have it and I will go 750
---
It's completely ridiculous and honestly just comes off lazy there isn't a single non feral ghoul or human or even robots you can interact with like in the past games. If we can survive others should be able to just as well and just the same there should be curious people wandering back into the area. 
---
76 person BR
---
My addictol usage has gone up soooo much.  I've actually equipped Pharma Farmer and hit up the medkit heavy areas just to resupply.
---
Thank god for the White Springs bunker and Watoga Med center!

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2f9gr/dumb_question_where_is_the_welcome_mat_for_your/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
The stash shouldn't be based on weight, it should be total item count, and allow us to bulk everything that is stackable so it incentives players to reduce server item load.
---
Fortunately Biv is very personable!
---
I think Garrahan manor would be a dope trade house it has a shooting range and tons of space! I would like a place to put our vending machines as well like a line with 1 spot for everyone on the server!
---
Thats fine. When you get online just message me
---
I have a screenshot I googled that showed all locations with minerals junk and so forth
---
It's a good name, NW
---
PA is bad because of all the perk cards that ignore amor which just bypasses your PA making you a big dumb target that’s easy to hit lol. Feels bad cause I like PA.
---
Gotta watch out on that timer.  It's particularly bad if you didn't flush the last day's extras because the new ones jump off the old one's timer.
---
Dude, thanks for the info. That's awesome.
---
Perfect! They could just make it photo realistic then and throw some snow.
---
There is a acid deposit next to one near the Monongah power plant. 
---
I like to willy wonka it, dress up in a nuka cola jacket, bottlecap sunglasses, and a top hat. Drop  a whole bunch of various Nuka Colas, including a Nukashine. Check the map every few minutes and wait for them to teleport
---
That would be great with all the vendors there soon. It would be like a little city or something since everyone would be there. 
---
I am not. I am think about getting it on pc when it comes on steam but for now I’m on ps4
---
I always hate when people join events and go afk to get the rewards
---
Nope this one is ones with pre built structures
---
Ah but it hurts to get rid of them. I'm holding on to them till player vending - these things gotta be worth some caps to somebody.
---
With the latest Tuesday update, chow line triggered once on Tuesday, I completed it, and the last two days none of the camden park events have triggered.
---
My general rule is that I don’t need to keep more than 100 of anything—and the things I use a lot rarely reach that high in the first place. 
---
Remember, if you have a ton of something, it’s because you don’t use it. 
---
Bulk what you can and sell it to the vendors, some scrap can’t be bulked and will sell as is. 
---
&gt;Wait, I hope that doesn’t mean that the other robots will beat the hell out of the BOS vendor like in Watoga.
---
Of course they won't. BOS vendor is not generally hostile to everyone but player.
---
It's the Watoga bots that are hostile to everyone, except players who have been "registered". Including the Watoga ST bot if they get a smell of him.
---
There is one next to water in the mire and next to a junk pile too.
---
But the junk pile is just out of range if you try to build on the tower i think.
---
Its south of Big Maw.
---
That ship sailed when vendors started holding all of their plans at all times.  
---
Does messing with the audio sliders affect it? Because I haven't noticed that sound being that loud for me.
---
I second the Atomic Shop music being too loud though. ALSO nothing beats being in the middle of a casual walk through Toxic Valley when Country Roads gets interrupted and my ear drums start bleeding from "IIIIITT'S GRAFTON DAY!" Ugh.
---
If Bethesda was worried about server crashes and pointless junk hogging up space, this is it. Once read/used just drop it. Why hang on to all that data and use up space. Think about all that crap in MISC or notes that we will never use again. Just delete the stuff and free up space. I drop all my notes. And now I don't pick any new ones up. When I purged my stash I has multiple duplicates because at once time I would pick everything up. 
---
The thing is, having a varied weapon selection makes the game have more replayability, that should also be considered.
---
At least give us a weapon rack that doesn't use stash weight for say 10 weapons.
---
Okay, I’ll be on tomorrow. PSN?
---
Eh they can get pretty costly at retail though, there's more than enough room to undercut them and make good caps.
---
Personally the only issue I've got is that they released a Camo bundle, and then immediately the day after released a new camo skin that isn't part of the bundle.
---
Ranger tower you say? I'm going to need to see this! My main is also a ranger!
---
http://imgur.com/xlnsovs
---
That's even worse. That was my CAMP before, always getting stuck in the cement foundation.
---
I want to get the mr fuzzy tokens at camden park, not alcohol,alcohol, alcohol. give us a break and just kill that Biv quest line and get the camden park working right.
---
There wouldn't be any power armor though!
---
I have beeged Bethesda to implement a "zoom" function to allow larger versions of letters and notes. I can read the computer terminals, but even on a large screen, my vislion isn't good enough to read the notes. 
---
So I have missed a lot of lore. 
---
When I was doing the parade there was a guy that kept going around trying to close the doors on all of the buildings and I ran around opening them all again. He didn’t like it. 
---
At first I was like it’s cool at the very beginning for the beer up date but after that might ask well give us free addictol because we’re all going to be alcoholics 
---
We, the players have called that and his linked super mutant friend as vendor faction. Bethesda might not consider it a faction.
---
BOS, Enclaive, Raiders, Responders and Free States are of course all full blown factions. Well blown out, too.
---
But what faction is a robot without any dead owners?
---
So far as someone that isn’t really experienced but has heard a few things and knows a few here are some things I know.
---
Screws are probably the most important junk. You can craft armor and you need almost 100 just for level 50 of the best power armor in the game. Repairing also needs screws (right now for me it’s 6 pieces each.
---
Ballistic stuff (I forget the name) is also used for repairing armor, keep some of it. 
---
You can easily make about 1200 caps everyday, so if you have like 10-20 minutes in which you aren’t doing anything you can get in quick and sell.
---
The vendors have a 200 cap limit that resets everyday and there is 7 different faction vendors which each have their own caps.
---
So 200x7 is 1400 but fast traveling will probably take a hundred or two.
---
If you are playing survival, I’d suggest not because if you don’t know how to build you’ll probably get creamed and lose most if not all your caps/junk.
---
This is worded badly and idk if I’m even correct on this stuff but I’ll update if no one else does.
---
ObesePigeon1
---
Silence is fucking creepy sometimes. You're not missing much.
---
They won't. Camps with vending will be tagged visible. If you'd have network to do shopping from there would be no point of that.
---
Yep, same here. When I fast travel I might get a quick pick if they shoot me or shoot someone else but other than that I get the hell out of there. 
---
I already don’t know how to get caps steadily, I don’t want to lose them.
---
There are recovering alcoholics who play this game. This must be triggering as fuck for them. I get that it's a challenge for Atoms, but ... damn, every day?
---
Wow that's rough, I hope you recorded that and repartee him to Bethesda and got him banned, that would of been a permanent ban for sure. Kids like that don't deserve to play online games
---
Drop both. They are absolutely the worst when 90% of the time your buddies are not on at the same time as you are. EMP is a killer though. I had to clear all my mutations just to drop that one. Ended up keeping here because I got tired of farming. May go back and buy the serums to get rid herd. 
---
I'll have to try that.  I knew that it was going to be a lot of trail and error and repeat
---
"I avoided 76, because, well, it got a lot of hate. I assumed everyone was right and that the game was a steaming pile of poop." &lt;It was. This is a past-tense comment, and in the past the game was shit.
---
"So today I put like 6-8 hours into 76 and I’m hooked." &lt;Game came out November 14, 2018. So it's been out over 4 months now. And received patches in that time, fixing some of the issues people were frustrated by.
---
"So, I’ve kinda learned my lesson, I really need to try games that look interesting to me before I listen to everyone else and judge them. I have a feeling I shall be spending a decent amount of time in 76!" &lt;Sure. Can do that. Also, waiting 4 months after release to buy it so that all the people who did buy it at release can raise their voices, be heard and get the game fixed to a more playable state works well.
---
But hey, I get it. You're wrong, you know you are, and because you can't make a single decent point against what I've said, you resort to trying to attack me. You search through comments I've made, hoping to embarrass or shame me. Won't work. All you've done is shown you're so utterly pathetic that rather than present /any/ evidence contrary to what I've said, you resort to angry screeching and name-calling.
---
Did you know that you could lose Aid in survival before you started playing? If so why didn't you put in the stash?
---
That sounds like fun!  I encourage player interactions like that and blowing up cars.  
---
If I saw a player leaving a Nuka Cola machine door open, I would vocally shame them, then close the door.  Then look for a car to blow up near them.
---
You'd have to contact G2A about it.
---
Yes, but opt in , not opt out plz.
---
Get unyileding armor and get used to surviving with low health. I can carry more without PA. I think my carry weight is over 400 now 
---
Please - I am tired of spawning in a river next to my house
---
You will find inventory management to be a constant battle in this game. You will catch on. Since you mentioned 3 vendors I am guessing Responders, Raiders and Whitesprings. There's Enclave in the Whitesprings bunker but you will have to do a quest to gain entry. Also have Free States, Watoga RR and BOS. Each gets 200 caps a day. You can return 24 hours after you clean one out. And take all his cap. There's also 2 wandering vendors that I know of. Graham the mutant. I shot him first time I saw him. Lol. And the lemonade stand Mr. Handy. But both can be hard to find.

Is it the problem with the key or the Bethesda launcher

I didnt buy the camo for my power armor and yet I have it

Judging by Bethesda's Status page -  https://bethesda.net/status
---
I'm gonna guess the key could have been revoked? I'd suggest contacting G2A https://supporthub.g2a.com/
---
I’m like you and I pick up everything and bulk it. I’ve started filling other characters with the bulked junk. I like hoarding and player vending machines will be here soon so I’m set for that. 
---
Same. How what where please help Banjo!
---
Yea sorry I was getting the end date and start date mixed up.
---
You'll lose them on death and sometimes when you re-log. If you keep your endurance low you can usually get an addiction within 5 uses, but 10 guaranteed. A lot of drugs are grouped though. Like mentats, berry mentats, orange mentats, grape mentats. So you don't need 5 of any one type, just 5 total.
---
No American power armor. Could have some bootleg wacky chinese attempts to counter power armor though. And lots of stealth suits...
---
Makes sense now
---
Well they can look out our window and see violence smoking drugs alcohol...not sex though.  Is there enough content for it.not to get boring?  My older son loves building the settlements in fo4.   I played day it released and I thought the camp was a joke.  Is it improved?  Is there stuff to do endgame that's not pvp?
---
Should have stashed them. It does say when joining survival that you may lose aid items.
---
No American power armor means no power armor at all. The US army we're the only ones to make Power Armor, although I would love to see a return of the Chinese stealth suit, you know the one that turns invisible when you crouch?
---
Ran into him 3 times and didn't do a damn thing. 
---
Thanks you I’ll look into it

Your feedback is irrelevant and misleading considering you've clearly ignored the relevant point of the sentence. If you want the legendary weapon rewards, you have no choice but to participate in a clearly ill-conceived system. You aren't "forced to participate" full stop, you are forced to do so if you want the related rewards. Conditional, not open statement. Selectively quoting me does nothing to counter my point.
---
Wait I’m confused... so they are combin8ng the daily 1400 caps we can get now into one pool and we buy from any of the vendors for the full amount? Sooooo they no longer need 90% of vendors in this game get rid of them maybe? Would be as buggy for sure, the sheer number of bots in this game make it lag
---
5, barely lasted 1
---
Wanna know something ironic? I really wish I had duped all that ammo they said I did. I'm having to farm 5.56 basically non stop and it's annoying as shit. 
---
Hardly matters. You can just FT near and run to the building.
---
&gt; Otherwise it wouldn't be accessible half the time by fast travel.
---
Like Enclaive is never? Like Harpers Ferry? (Distance from it's FT target to vendor is about the same as WS ST to WS resot door)
---
That looks fantastic! 
---
Wouldn't it be nice....
---
Depends on the mood I'm in, usually use default just for the *immersion* but there are times the full-screen mode is preferable.
---
I actually love this mode for this, I killed a guy with 150 stimpaks so I’m set for life. I then lost all but 2. I lost most of my food, most of my water, nuka colas and drugs, etc.
---
I now actually have to survive. I need to actually find animals and kill them, trade for food, find water that I can make into boiled and shit like that. I love it just for that.
---
This exactly.  The explosive bullets are easy to identify and i think its similar to calling a copy machine a "Xerox machine".  Just because it's not necessarily a two-shot 3* legendary explosive rifle doesn't change how unbalanced it is just like the copier being a different brand from Xerox doesn't change the fact that it's currently out of paper.
---
Try a route of summersville down to the junk pile in the middle of the lake to the South. Camp mcCintok, to Wade airport, to tell Capitol building to the train station. It's a great way to farm .308, gunpowder and steel. Hope this helps. Sorry for bad spelling in on mobile ATM.

Underrated post
---
Thank you thank you! Ranger-Atlas reporting for duty.
---
That's an interesting point I say. Man would that change the game. Big boy with top tier shit would think he's invincible.  Come along Mr level 30 bad ass with the game to his advantage. Mr Badass losses his pride piece of armor to a guy who can't even use it yet. 
---
I love it 
---
Well take my 30mins-of-survival-mode take with a grain of salt, but it seems like a scoring system might be in order.  Give folks a point every minute they live, plus points for killing others.  So if you sit around long enough you'll hit the chart, but those actually Pvping will get up there much more often.  
---
I’ll check that out tomorrow. Thanks. 
---
Have you tried aiming instead?
---
Honestly at first this kind of irritated me. I was like why do you need a participation trophy. Then I read it...not a bad idea
---
https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
Im thinking opposite. Now that people won't have much desire to FT to other parts of maps, so they might come to WS. Particularly to check for mods, or mid levels would check for posssible plans.
---
Now if WS golf club is nuked at same time, particularly so that only it is under the nuke, not resot, then that increased player traffic will mean the golf club gets reset more often, by players entering the area. 
---
More high level legendaries to farm, over and over, till the server gets enough. Normally you need a bit coordinated team or just at least two players who know what they are doing, to keep resetting it. If there is enough player traffic anyone alone could do it, and just some random showing up would do the reset.
---
I believe I have one I could sell you! I won’t be on until tomorrow though. 
---
I think on the post they did where they broke it out by date, it said April. Without a number. But then there’s something with a number in the second week of April after that so I assume maybe it’s next week. I hope so. 
---
&gt;You could drown a toddler in my panties right now.
---
... Not that you would...
---
Obviously, yes, and shots land fine.  VATS has always been a fundamental mechanic of Fallout games, though, so I thought the developers might treat it more carefully. 
---
Why would you craft more serums than what you need or could sell to players? I don't really see point to sell serums to vendors. Particularly because the player vending will come same time. You want to sell them to players because there's no cap limit to selling to players.
---
You got it!!!!! I didn’t know if anyone got it! 
---
He didn't know
---
You're absolutely right.  Balance would be non-legendary level 50 gear being viable in PvP.  Not comparable, someone with full 3*legendary gear should still win the majority of the time assuming both combatants are equal skill.  As it is now you could play CoD at a tournament level and still get wrecked if you don't have any 3* legendary gear by someone who does.
---
Also the turret thing worries me seeing as how they are basically saying that the base destruction damage will not be removed by the time player vending comes as they would not need to be affected by pvp damage if otherwise. That is very disheartening seeing as how all the trolls who left for survival temporarily will be back and destroying hard build player shops because let’s face it polish a turd it’s still a turd turrets are extremely easy to destroy
---
The club doesnt reset like it used too. It's on a timer now so not necessarily linked to new people coming in to the area. I've been there several times since the last couple patches and everything is dead. Waited probably 10-15min and they spawn again. Watched numerous people walk in and out and nothing. 
---
Make it a survival only event that happens in a random location in the world and that'd be a pretty cool idea imo
---
I guess people are more excited to throw knives at the dart board. Sigh.
---
Really?15 same server?
---
Id suggest also that it's tied to your overall session kills and anyone at 0 kills is immune to being in the top 3 and having location displayed.
---
Me too i like PA, for the jetpack, emergency protocols, reactive plates and carry weight, too bad all those still make it horrible for pvp
---
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step back and think about what you said, because everyone needs a bit of wiffle ball bat in their life. 
---
Banjo wants a ghoul mask for RP
---
Yeah the level up while drunk 3 times is tough unless it's  the weekend
---
Same with the complete 5 quests while drunk and wearing a beerhat
---
I already spend most of my session selling stuff to vendors, looking forward to the 1400 shared vendor caps.
---
Also, crafting 50 alcoholic beverages, while fairly easy is way more than I need, and I pretty much just drink booze instead of water.
---
Though I have to admit, I had a challenge to kill 25 enemies in the Cranberry Bog while drunk on Cranberry Moonshine, don't have the recipe for it but bought a bottle at Harpers Ferry, and killed enough robots at Watoga to complete the challenge after drinking the one bottle. That was pretty cool.
---
Or the sound of idiot savant from FO4, just at a lower volume.
---
Yeah but he was talking about the dog. Only dog I know is fixed spawn, was is east of Harpers Ferry, high up on a mountain.
---
We're getting player Vending on April 9 anyway though an auction house as an extra wouldn't be a terrible idea.
---
There are days I don’t play much but try to sell for caps. This can just help supplement that. 
---
While its great if you're a lone survivor afaik it doesn't change the spawn for teammates. They might plummet to their doom no matter what! So be careful with teammates.
---
What times are you usually on
---
yus. It's going to be nice. Most of my play sessions have been nothing but vendoring for most of them.. 5mins of actual play and then logging out again... this should shift things a bit X.x
---
Ffffuccckkk. That unmarked moonshine shack near the factory is wear my camp is lol. Here's hoping it doesn't fuck anything up
---
On PC most no one is going to sell great stuff anyway for caps.
---
Yeah I ran into him for the first time yesterday. I wasn't to sure what to think of it.
---
Yeah I would spawn IN the river when I had mine near one.
---
Same server. About 3 had stars though, the rest were just legendary. Idk if someone nuked nearby or random spawns, it was a lot.
---
no legendary items as well what so ever, as they completely throw off balance
---
Ok. Thanks
---
Thx I kno there's def at least 3 there
---
Wow, that's wild! I wonder where else you could kite those enemies to...
---
I have 80 some hours on the game and the first time I have seen of him
---
Well, there could be leftover armors from the invasion. There could even be prototypes they'd been testing out, like Flamer Armors, or Super-Heavy Armors.
---
I might have over looked it but thank you very much, I hope so too :)
---
I'm confused though. Why move the vendors to white spring at all if you're pooling the caps? Traveling to purchase things was never problematic. It was the constant traveling to sell things. Hunting for vendors to /buy/ is somewhat interesting. Hunting for them to sell was not.
---
Huh, throw it in Alaska, with the Chinese foot holds, and I'd be pretty interesting. But up until this point we've been told that the Chinese were the bad guys, even going so far as to tell their own men just to gain inches during the invasion of Alaska. 
---
I was wondering the same thing. I heard somewhere that they where introducing junk decoration and I was really excited but I couldn't find anything on it.
---
Wednesday Thursday and weekends at night
---
How amazing would it be if players can write their own insults, and then other players find it LOL
---
My opinions, go for the important junk (gears, screws, etc.) Keep some extra black titanium around as well as steel and wood. Depending on how you get your ammo, and what ammo you use, maybe lead and gunpowder. You'll figure out what you need and what you don't pretty quick. I really only keep weapons/armor that I am or am going to use (as in it is a higher lvl than me right now). And I almost never keep drugs. I have a small stash of 5 buffout and 5 bufftats for emergency purposes. Every other drug I sell to vendors. They make good caps. Also pay attention to how much aid you carry. Some food can be a small chunk of weight and a number of them added up can weigh you down. Oh, and another thing, always always always scrap junk. It's much easier to carry the scrapped components than the junk itself. I can often cut 20-30 pounds by continuously scrapping
---
The fix that made VATS more responsive never worked consistently for me. I find I still have to wait a second or two before shooting after activating VATS.
---
I notice that if I target something in VATS, kill it, exit VATS, then target something else, it immediately shows an incorrect high hit percent. If I wait 1 or 2 seconds like we had to before, it changes to the expected lower accuracy.
---
Annoyed the crap out of me the other day.
---
Found me, I ignored him, he persisted, I killed him.
---
It doesn't drop the plans. It's directly unlocked in your crafting table, I think.
---
Yes. JuiceHead mentioned them in his first video after Patch 7 😉
---
Yes
---
I want ten cats at my camp. Lol.
---
Yeah he must be pretty rare or new because I have 200 hours in the game and only saw him yesterday.
---
I'm a little worried that [my camp](https://imgur.com/hdi2WG1) will start to be unplaceable after this goes into effect, or take me 20 tries to find a server.  Also, I hope that farming legendaries at whitesprings won't be a hot mess with everyone's bases and turrets screwing up the clubhouse and back 9 ghoul spawns.  
---
It would be a good opportunity to extend the no-build zone around the clubhouse in particular.
---
It should be Super sheep instead.
---
Super mutant out loose, before the war, should have done far more havoc.
---
Yeah it would be good.
---
Maybe if we had private servers someone could come up with a mod.
---
Sadly I have never encountered such a god-like being 
---
Literally who?
---
Is there anything further with them, or is this just more weird stuff like Vault 51?
---
Honestly, I didn't think about it at the time and just blocked him and reported them through the PSN 
---
It's a different pose.
---
Yeah I agree.  While it's nice I don't one shot people with my fist, slower 2h melee stands no chance against range if both are wearing equal sets.  The big difference is you can't attack while receiveming the cavalier bonus, but sentinel can.  So while you're punching, they are shooting at point blank.  They have full reduction, you have none.  If you wear sentinel on melee you can't close the distance.   So it's lose lose lol
---
Could you imagine trying to find a server with all your camp locations available. Sounds like you would be spending a lot of time moving.
---
Massive copyright issue, I guess.
---
Some of the junk items don’t bulk, like fiberglass spools. So keep an eye on those. I try to keep no more than 100 or so of any of the junk, except maybe plastic and screws and springs. You get the hang of it over time. There are more vendors that open up as you progress. The train station in watoga ties to Graham the wandering super mutant and also the random lemonade vendors. Maybe more. Not sure. There’s also a brotherhood of steel robot in watoga that is not linked to anywhere else and one in harpers ferry. That’s 7 that I have opened up including the enclave one in the white springs bunker mentioned above. So every day I go around and get 1400 caps. I don’t use chems much except for rad away and stim packs so I get a lot of caps from selling chems that I pick up. I also have some outfits and hats I can make that get a lot of caps. 
---
Nope. Crit builds based on vats are great for countering op tank builds.
---
Yeah that would be pretty bad lol
---
Worked after fast traveling away and back lol
---
TIL about the Wood Chucker perk.
---
I'm level 170, but it's not showing up as available to pick? Do I just have to be lucky enough to get it in a card pack?
---
You have a very destructive presence.
---
It doesn’t have to THEM.  But it would be cool to hear belt out a classic song or two. 
---
Or it could be that those wallpapers etc is future atom shop content ? Don’t think we going to “rent” a room at whitesprings.
---
Thanks :)
---
Over not being able to place your camp? You'll be the one missing out not them. Cant wait for ES6 butbi guess you eont be playing that...
---
Let me know if you get a photo for the scope bug :)
---
Good to know.. Patch 6 &amp; 7 fixed allot, but introduced a bunch of new issues :(
---
Maybe dont carry that many on you???
---
Well, shit. Guess I might as well sell my low end stuff
---
Don't suppose you have a source?
---
Reminds me of:
---
https://youtu.be/WF56VO0qqLQ
---
I just recently traded unyielding sentinel/cavalier piece into instigating explosive handmade. If I'd find assassin sentinel/cavalier piece I'd except two good guns from it.(not talking about how much it's worth, just general idea)
---
The only thing that could possibly be "cheating" or bad in trading, is all the masses of duped shit. But we can't do anything about them. Just have to accept that.
---
Even all the great rolls you ever might get, many of them would not fit to what you are doing. Guns when you are mainly doing melee, heavy guns when you do pistols, ect ect. Trading is very obvious thing to do.
---
You wanna play as a snallygaster? :0
---
Nothing yet but the Vault itself may be the scene of the next Sheepsquatch DLC in two weeks ;)
---
They are prob on top of a train station somewhere 
---
Took my combat knife from 108 to 198. Thanks!
---
"That One" bar
---
Saw him tonight but he wouldn't insult me.  Just 'wait a minute' or something like that when I interacted.  Random spawn point between Sutton and Helvetia.
---
&gt; Got #1 on my server as a lvl 9 surviving for 2 hours
---
Played this way, you're basically trading caps for XP when some rando fast-travels and ganks you. The map's easily big enough, and population sparse enough, that you won't see another soul until you hit the leaderboard.
---
I think the "optimal" play is to go do your solo questing in survival for the extra XP, then once you hit the leaderboard (about an hour it seems?), hop over to adventure, die, and come back.
---
Tomahawks too!!! I want to have a growing tang at my next camp
---
I have marsupial which I am selling for 300 each
---
We got a badass over here! J/k, nice going.
---
Oh it would be easier. But I don't see it quite coming. It would take quite an infrastucture from Bethesda to implement. They are clearly going different route and implementing just server scale individual vending.
---
Yeah I have a few of those no idea what they do...
---
I've not played in about a week because of these challenges..I used to get on and do as many atom quests as I could whilst wandering to new locations and exploring, getting supplies needed for the dailies.. But ever since the "level up 5 times whilst intoxicated and naked" or some other insanely hard requirement.. I just havent been feeling like playing, 
---
Yeah same i have no idea
---
You could also just suicide at the safety of your camp before you get to top 3. Dont think you'll lose caps that way. 
---
Only annoying thing to me is having to walk to each mob filled location rather than being able to freely fast travel to it. That might cut quite a bit of time on the xp gains walking place to place rather than clearing one area then fast travel to the next and so on 
---
Lol. My fast travel puts me at the bottom of the river my camp is built on. Every.  Damn. Time. 
---
It’s kinda funny tbh. 
---
Simple Rick
---
If the whitesprings ghouls were plopped down in a different location and still available for weapon and armor farming in the same numbers, I'm all for this.  If the ghouls are just eliminated and not supplanted with somewhere else to get mileage out of legendary farming, then this is a horrible idea.  
---
As the map is currently laid out, I can think of two other spots where I can get a fair chance at starred legendary enemies, but the whitespring is far and away the best spot, nuke zone or regular.  Taking that away would remove a premier end game spot for a LOT of players.
---
&gt;  Why are you even in survival mode?
---
That phat 20% xp, duh. Also jokes on you, I'm just carrying a bunch of spoiled meat.
---
&gt; When I purged my stash I has multiple duplicates because at once time I would pick everything up. 
---
Years of Fallout/Elder Scrolls have trained us to do just that. It was hard to get out of that habit.
---
Harpers ferry, sugar cove , west tek, watoga and white springs. 
---
I would also love to buy one.
---
100% agreed.
---
Sure. My psn is ObesePigeon1
---
Oh shit I remember that spot! Thank you!
---
Personally I'm loving the hard lemonade.  30 to max ap and 10 ap regen for 10 minutes is solid.  It's a bit more resource intensive to craft it tho

I'd love to argue, but this isn't the first time it's happened to me. This is from Fallout 4: https://gfycat.com/barrenseriousharborseal
---
I fired zero shots in that clip, and yet two raiders died.
---
Hmm, ok.  Maybe I have become more hasty than necessary lately.  I'll give an extra second or so of patience a try.
---
It's you.  What is the point of saying you have 4500 atoms except to feel superior and brag.  Plenty of people who saw this post have more than 800, or more than 4500, atoms and didn't feel the need to say anything, but for some reason you did.  Why is that exactly?
---
Same, lol
---
Very rare but ironically, after I bought it, I saw it more than before I made the purchase... Don't forget to equip the hard bargain perk(s) before purchase... I've seen it at both Watoga vendors I think, but also one of the Train Station Vendors... I think Sutton maybe?
---
And if you contact support about it they'll blame your CPU!  #ThanksBethesda #ItJustWorks

I got a rock...

 I normally hate excessive cosmetics in games but I honestly won’t mind this at all, great idea

Ps4, so they would blame sony?

The FO4 perk system was superior to the FO76 system by far.

---
There are a couple of tinkerers benches in the world that you can hear from practically the other side of the sun. 
---
the first time it happened to me it scared the ever-loving shit out of me because I had barely used that bench and had no idea what the mysterious sound was coming seemingly from nowhere.
---
I'll kill somebody if they bring back my blackbird
---
There's a random spawn there with an Attack Dog you can tame 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b50had/i_just_tamed_a_dog/
---
Really? It's possible but I'd like to see more confirmation. Specially when whole WS area is nuked, people run all around because no one knows where live enemies are.
---
If those people have been near the golf club before, they won't count as new. 
---
The best way to do it is have someone exit and re-enter the server. IF that is no longer resetting it, then must be it doesn't reset any other cells elsewhere either. But that has to be a really recent chance. About a week ago I've waited on Harpers and new players coming in have reset the enemies.
---
Probably blame your firewall then. They did that when my Deathclaw took 40% of my CAMP allotment.
---
First off, scrap everything. I haven't seen anyone mention that yet. There's no need to have a fan. Or aluminum canister in your inventory. Scrapping it I to parts saves you so much space.
---
Second, you have to know about the bulk option. Once you get going. You'll unlock the tinker workbench. using it you can bulk all of your junk to save even more space.
---
Third, steel and wood are probably the two most common junk materials in game. If you have an excessive amount that it's taking up inventory space, toss some.
---
I hope I gelped 
---
I have one but cant place it, how do I place it
---
Thanks, it feels completely different from what all the videos from the last couple months made it seem lol
---
I'd imagine it's just a item interface for the existing photomode. Nothing fancy to get excited about.

I got them 100 caps a pop thank you though

Hit up bizerk on psn and add a message about wanting serums. He sells them for like 200 caps each usually 
---
I like survival as is, maybe a few tweaks but its atleast 90% complete to me!!
---
40% damn! I didn't know they took that much lol
---
Same. Now I'm just waiting for a glitch to place it.
---
I don’t know how many times I’ve spawned on a tiny ledge

Right ? It makes no sense.

I have the music turned all the way down and the main menu makes my ears bleed by how loud it is. :(

Kinda soon to know survival mode is 3 days old lol
---
Yeah, I honestly haven't experimented much with suicide. My mid-30s life is still broke AF, so I mostly walk everywhere and look for duct tape anyways. (I promise both of those statements are fo76 and not real life)
---
I have noticed that simply switching servers/modes won't help though.
---
Maybe not a realistic desire, but I would love an aerial view while building in your CAMP, or camera flight for the tricky placements. FO4 settlement quality of life mods spoiled me.
---
I do not have the plan for it either. I want it now too. And I am unsure why... best of luck in the search. 
---
Server jump the random encounter spawn until you get the civil war reeanactor with civil war era top hat plan, then you can make the hats (1 cloth each) and sell them for 15 caps each with no perks, over 30 with hard bargain level 3. That's with a low charisma stat as well
---
They look delicious.
---
I know on PC there are a few all women gangs running about.. I play with a lady that is almost 70 in real life and she is great. I have found a lot fo them have very jealous husbands and that is why they never talk in game. I get that.. but really it's a game so not really sure what the problem is there. especially in this game.. the worst you could do is emote a heart at someone till they run away screaming. lol. 
---
I just don't do them. They're really pissing me off.
---
Makes it an even more prime nuke target
---
This is true, but also if you already have the game when you pick up the magazine it won't count.  Drop the Holo tape game and then pick up the magazine, you'll get another copy and it will count for the challenge.
---
resort tables according to that link i just posted for you
---
As if *anybody* likes having to craft 50 alcohol and level up wearing a beer hat every other fucking day for their dailies.
---
probably sold by the whitespring furniture  plan vendor
---
Trading won't trigger it, nor will playing it (except nuka tapper).  You have to actually find the magazine.  Plus, If You're carrying the tape, you have to drop it before picking up the magazine or it won't count.  
---
I gave each of the 5 ones that were in range of me 6 minutes of "ok what do you do?"  
---
When the timer ran out I said the same thing to each one:   
---
Hey! Laser lips!! Yo momma was a snow blower!!  
---
Then promptly shot them with whatever I had equipped. Their loot sucks. Lol 
---
That’s a different take, if you look at it from a lore perspective. Yeah, even with no legendaries, why do people drop so easy in power armor? They should withstand serious punishment. 
---
I want a trophy for teddy bear pictures....   I have one photo with one teddy bear in a stew pot and the other teddybear with a cooking knife and a cutting board....  There are many other teddybear crafted scenes scattered around....

Just now loaded into a place with no hostiles, and went "OOF"; took 10% of my hp damage as a technical data swooped in outta nowhere and tried to fucking RKO me
---
I have probably eight of those if you want one on PS4.
---
I keep spawning in a van down by the river.

He's on my friends list but he got off

I’m hoping the legendary vendors sells legendary PA mods. We had legendary PA in FO4 idk why we don’t have any in 76.
---
Fallout PvP is simply for trolls/campers/griefers who are not good enough to compete in other better games that offer PvP, so they come to Fallout 76 "Camper Mode" and think they are good by constantly spawn killing and camping all the train stations....patting themselves on the back for the weakest of accomplishments. Until all player blips are gone and VATS isn't allowed you'll never see me in that troll/camper/griefer mode. Too many people exploiting VATS with OP melee builds, it needs to go.
---
YES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE can we get a petition going?
---
At least a level five doesn’t have 500 aid items to lose.....
---
I have... so many things to find.... O_O 
---
You are a god among insects. Never let anyone tell you different. 
---
Seriously. Kudos.  
---
I checked Pleasant Valley Train Station for you but unluck times..
---
E. Nuff. I didn't make a farmer character. I drank more in this video game in a week than I have all year.
---
well i can't take credit for the link but i will take credit for showing it to you lol
---
I made a video explaining how to change where you spawn in your camp two months ago.
---
Here is the link if anyone is interested:

Like I said, note the green door and fencing. There's also junk on the floor, not present in CAMP builds. There's also torn ceilings, and the undersides of CAMP floors are not skinned.
---
Hotel Mario MMORPG
---
Yes this will create a hub. Nice one. 
---
Are you in pacifist mode
---
Good way of putting it. When I realized the value of the atom, I gave up on trying to do them and stopped playing this wannabe cash cow haha
---
If you have pacifist mode on, you can shoot all you want, accidentally or not....
---
RIP.
---
I've noticed if Im online around 2 am EDT and have been on that server for a while it will turn into a ghost town.
---
Yeah, they made all sorts of really cool perks for team play, but playing as a team is always a hindrance to efficiency, and 85% (rng!) is because of the XP issue. If they make this minor adjustment, team play will be hugely rewarding. Isn't that good for the game and community?
---
A black cowboy hat. Never seen anyone else wear one. 
---
Awesome teamwork
---
First guy, tf, second guy I understand, they did that a lot on survival. You have an ability that kills people/creatures just by looking at them and I'm glad you won't ever see me.
---
So the buggiest area in the game is going to get even more crowded? That's just...awesome??
---
Power armor doesn't provide screws when scrapped, neither do weapons. Not in FO76, used to in FO4.
---
Got one for you. Sorry for the quality. I cant screen grab while it happens sini had to video and take stills. The top is how it's supposed to be. And th e bottom is what randomly happens. It's not all the time, so not super game breaking, but when it happens in combat it's a pain in the ass. I suspect it may be due to the animation failing to call. But I'm not a programmer. Here ya go.

No prob
---
I didn't know what it meant either....  like plans and mods...   I learn something new every day...   
---
Harpers ferry has it on the reg as well 
---
So you consider an expressed wish for a game to implement private servers to avoid trolls to be... trolling? Methinks a mirror would be appropriate at this point.
---
I seen 3 people with the Skelton mask so it wss possible buy hey I have the ability to open a donut shop now!
---
Thanks. Back when I posted this however the keypad wasn’t operational. It is now since a recent patch though. :)
---
I've been playing PVE on the new servers but because only the top 3 rank can be seen. I've started a new character and I'm in really high level areas. If I die by NPCS, good because I can get my loot back and I'm now at the bottom of the longest life list. Getting 30% exp with well rested bonus  and the only time I can ever be killed by another player is if we happen to run into each other which is unlikely given the size of the map and the fact that we can't see each other but that also adds  tension which is great.
---
Anyone Wanted "should" be free for all to kill without the need to engage. Something is def broken. I suspect the server did not load properly like when your quest or carry weight is bugged.
---
Last Call. You’ll instantly know it’s a bar when you read it. I’ve seen lost of camp but still haven’t stumbled across a bar build yet (my teammate built one however)
---
It's will be ironically but what about The Spirit? 
---
Gotta be, turn it off bro.
---
In power armour I miss 100% of the time on the first second and sometimes third swing. In no power armour no issues. 
---
Major bug has me playing less since the constant nerfs and realigning special the game is becoming more of a hassle than enjoyable. 
---
Push people to either sentinel or melee but melee very rarely works with vats.
---
Super annoying, super frustrating. 
---
IMO bounty in survival mode shouldn't reward caps. It should put your location on the map, the higher the caps the longer you'll be visible in the map. That means you'll be hunted by everyone for a period of time.
---
Logging off / switching mode back to adventure shouldn't clear the debuff in survival mode.
---
They're only supposed to take 10%, but mine kept dying and coming back to life, and every time it came back it took another 10%. 
---
And literally, they asked if my firewall was allowing the game to work. I was like wtf are you kidding? My firewall? 
---
Fuck yes it would! Two camps now! Rebuild Appalachia? How? We have to tear down our workshops and camps constantly. 
---
I asked this in another thread but I want to get your take on it too. In the past I've read that the Whitespring bots don't give you anything, and that's been my experience too. But there are a few comments saying that you CAN get fusion cores from the sentry bots there. 
---
I went on a couple rampages there, and when I kill the sentry bots, no loot whatsoever, no exp.
---
What am I doing wrong, or what are you doing right?
---
It's an incredibly expensive plan. Around 9,600 even with max hard bargain iirc
---
You'd probably be better off keeping an eye out for another player selling it
---
Well that's a new excuse lol how did you fix it?
---
I don’t like passing along shoddy info, but my Vampire Mole Mines gauntlet gives me 5hp per strike.  
---
Waterfall = Water Bar
---
Sounds like waterfall &amp; sells water &amp; alcohol too :)
---
You should reach out to customer service, if you haven't already. 
---
Just north to that is a popular spot with a junk node.
---
Yep, all the trolls/campers/griefers have their own servers now....yay!!! Stay there. Fight amongst yourselves and keep thinking you are good wearing your duped gear you would have never found without buying it from a 3rd party website....Nothing but Pay to win Players in Camper Mode Beta. 
---
Two entirely different builds. If your not bloodied build use the aae or tse. If your bloodied build only use the bloodied.
---
This too as a weekly challenge would be nice. There's a reference to Breaking Bad with teddy bears. 
---
Good idea.
---
Idk started a fresh character everytime I'm in board I get ready for impending doom. I love it. 
---
When i spawn at my camp i have my face against a cliff rock.
---
I played Dungeons and Dragons Online for several years, and they had special events that would last 2-3 weeks seasonally each year.  There was a halloween event in a graveyard, ice skating events in the winter, an easter egg hunt in the spring and something else in the summer which I forget.
---
Fastnacht seems like the start of something very cool, and I'd like to see more limited time events in 76.  They're always fun, players get hyped to do them again after enjoying it the year prior, and limited goodies are never a bad thing.
---
DDO also gave away a little "treasure sack" to each player for each anniversary of the game.  I was around for the 10 year gift, and it was pretty amazing.  (that game just celebrated 13 years!) 
---
I'd like to see 76 do something similar as a small "thank you" to players that stuck around through a pretty tough winter.  Maybe a "survivor" power armor skin that looks charred and blistered from all the hate and internet flame.
---
Not camp locations unfortunately 
---
Dang that sucks. What about workshops?
---
They are aware. Posted this a long time ago. We still need it.

Video game engine physics. He bumped in to an object, it spazzed out, and dealt waaay too much damage to him.
---
Used to happen a lot to me in Oblivion/Skyrim when walking over bones.
---
So I asked OP this then I asked someone in a different thread. Now I'm asking you! :D
---
In the past I've read that the Whitespring bots don't give you anything, no loot, no exp, nothing... and that's been my experience too. But this thread and some comments would indicate otherwise.
---
I went on a couple rampages there tonight, and when I kill the sentry bots, no loot whatsoever, no exp.
---
Obviously he turned the firewall off!!  Har har :D
---
Start a new character, there be moonshine hut down the hill. Level drunk 3 times is not so hard at the lowest level. Then delete new character and do it all again next day, if you can stand it.
---
I am with you though, need some different challenges.
---
While they are at it, can they fix some 40 atom challenges that have been broken since Beta? Still will not give the pick a swamp plant challenge or even some where all I have to is visit a town or dam.
---
It’ll probably come out, The last picture on the road map looks like a tiny robot to me.
---
Again nope.
---
But check out this map to help you plan

Thanks :D

Credit where credit is due. :D

Now to hope I remember where I bookmarked that when the rum wears off. 
---
Don’t complain here, complain to customer support 
---
It would make having a base on one of the peaks of sennaca so much nicer. Mostly i spawn first under my foundation. Another thing that happens is i spawn inside the mountain and fall down the inside.usually surivie and then can walk inside it.
---
How much camp budget does pets take?
---
I assumed it would be quite difficult to have random center circle on top of a moving player. If its center is linked to the player's position, then big or small doesn't matter at all...
---
I am being completely honest. I don't do anything besides go kill them. Everyone I have killed has given me loot and cores. I have not played since the survival update. They may have changed something. I'm sorry. I will check when I can get on tomorrow and report back to u. 
---
In pacifist mode, it wouldn't say that damage is reduced until players return fire; it would just say that you can't damage them while in pacifist mode

I don’t think I’d be a good fit but I would love to see the end result, I have a few friends I’ll ask

Furniture Entry Blocked happened to me with my blueprints. Certain chairs and benches will have you sit or get up and clip through a wall. Yeah your old camp is done now, but you get to build a new one. I suggest testing what you build in small bits with blue prints. At any rate there are way too many restrictions on camp design so I feel you. 
---
But what about question one? 
---
thanks but pc lol 
---
u can tame them from first day of the game.. but just like real ones useless.
---
Damn ES6.... can’t wait to see what they let us do, they haven’t used camps in ES yet. I hope it’s extensive and they give us total freedom to build insane shit. 
---
u can have one tamed animal at once. bether choice to tame a megasloth or deathclaw
---
Do you know link? I found only forum.
---
Because being intoxicated is the only way to enjoy this game (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
---
Google “Bethesda Customer support”. I don’t have the link or I would give you it. 
---
I have one on my makn character! It's awesome
---
The WunderBAR
---
He's a commie bastard!
---
If he was, it wouldn't say that damage is reduced until players return fire (which is no longer true anyway); it would say that you can't damage them while in pacifist mode.
---
This is the 3rd post in 2 days about this. You aren’t the only one, my dude 
---
Try this map some genius made....
---
Complete Mayor for a Day on Watoga and the bots are no longer hostile towards you. 
---
It also gives one of the best Melee Weapons in the game, so is wait until level 50 to do it v
---
But it would say your in pacifist and not doing any damage to other players. Which could be misread or mis interpreted in the heat of battle. Always good to double check with some people who never partake in PvP. They have no idea they are in pacifist and get upset when they don’t do any damage. Or it could be a bug with the no slap damage update hard to know for sure since this has never happened to me before. 
---
was in the beta, idk why it got removed.
---
they even added radio's back in
---
By the dam do you mean the graft on steel yard? Because there’s always dozens and dozens there. 
---
I kinda want Nuclear Winter to be a battle royale mode, not because I like battle royale games, I just want it to be that for the meme, I guess.
---
But if you like building and questing why don’t play on adventure server ? Iam not against you’re idea it should count player kills not longest time alive but I still wonder why you play survival ?
---
Well there’s a iron deposit a west Tek and lots of paint cans on the roof, not exactly the same thing but almost 
---
No, especially not fucking China. What a shithole. 
---
Got m3 fooled....thought the game didn’t let me learn the plans 
---
After a few days it just cleared itself up. 
---
I'd only even noticed because I moved and suddenly couldn't build half my stuff. 
---
See when I heard about that I thought it was stupid. Then I experienced the update and it's just jesus christ Bethesda go to AA or something, your obsession with alcohol is ridiculous 
---
I’m half drunk right nwo....
---
If it makes you feel any better, currently.. The map is jacked up because it will either only show the person in first places map marker, but it displays it as third place or it doesn't show anyone for the top 3. It's actually sort of nice haha.
---
I want hudred of cats, want them everywhere.
---
I found some scorched parts in jars at Morgan town airport that I need in my laboratory.
---
Anyone know when the display junk thing is coming?
---
Have one in my camp currently that last time I checked still works, beta player perks I guess. 
---
Lasting for 76 mins
---
What about an Eyebot?
---
Same here, and he's camp is just a big corn and razorgrain field with the brewing stations. 
---
But I've noticed the trend that the dailies are getting a bit harder to do. I guess they want us to use more money, which is actually fine by me. I want to support this game, but the atom shop has too little items that I actually want so I always manage to save up atoms and get it for free. 
---
Please add a lot more to the atom shop so I can actually start spending money on this game! :/
---
a dog perk from fo4 was in the game files when 7.5 released. ''attack dog'' is the name of the perk.
---
Atoms Pro Tip: If you start a new character, you can level up 3 times with ease, while intoxicated. There's booze in Flatwoods to get you started. 
---
But, I agree wholeheartedly with what you're saying. These challenges are ridiculous and becoming extremely redundant.   Anyway,  hope this help with at least the level up drunk challenge.  Cheers!
---
I don't stream or have many friends  but please let me know when this is open to the public because it sounds amazing.
---
Antiseptic for me. Was Marie Kondo-ing my stash to store food and chems to hop over to survival and found around the same ridiculous amount of antiseptic as you did asbestos
---
Yes, you *could*, but how bout we not have to waste valuable perk point real estate on *yet another* 'annoyance mitigation' '''perk''', instead of actually having viable builds?  Just a suggestion.
---
I just wish we had a hardcore mode. I was hoping that's what survival mode would be, but instead it's just the pvp server. It would be nice to have some enemies that can damage you inside of power armor, something where you need to be smart with your tactics and/or legendary effects instead of just tanking everything. 
---
Level 68 super mutants with assault rifles and laser guns is just sad. Bring out flamers, fat men, gatling lasers, .50 cal MGs, anything! It shouldn't be a rare spawn, EVERY high level mutant should have top-tier gear.  
---
Max level scorched with pump action shotguns, pipe guns, and hunting rifles? That's just pathetic. They should be using handmades, combat shotguns, and plasma rifles. Hell, I think scorched should be able to use legendary weapons. Remember in FO4 when a legendary raider would end up with a weapon and then used it against you? The fight suddenly got exciting when instead of getting pelted with a pipe rifle, there was suddenly an explosive SMG raining hell down upon you. 
---
It's been hinted at that some of the future vaults will have high level dungeons with something like this, but I sincerely hope they go all the way with it. I doubt they will make a third game mode for a more difficult experience, but at least having something with a bigger threat would be nice. As it stands the only challenging endgame is either playing naked or nuking a few enemy-dense areas, and even there the real challenge is the radiation. 
---
no not yet maybe some day
---
I found one of these hats with one of my low level characters when I did the Nukashine quest.  I got teleported to a table and chairs set up for a party in the middle of a wilderness area. The hat was on one of the chairs I think.
---
Most odd object I have found was one I couldn't pick up. A lifesized cutout silhouette of a crow way up on some rocks in the middle of nowhere. I could knock it over and move it by running into it but it was not anything I could pick up.
---
Stealth sniper is one of the top builds, i role with that and its hella fun, but i go all in with a rifle build and 0 melee 
---
Oh it had not noticed it before, thanks :
---

---
But, that could be anything. It look like a 3 legged robot and i even see dots on his face that could be eyes and mouth, but it still could be anything.
---
Are you talking about survival pvp or adventure pvp? Two modes two different styles. 
---
Lol.  I like this.  Bullies equal raiders.  You are basically forming a raider faction specifically meant to target other raiders.  It’s awesome!
---
I know the feel
---
https://i.imgur.com/SRh6gPo.jpg
---
The ones in the background are mine too. They don't all fit on one inventory screen
---
Indeed, but the waving of the vault dweller makes it look friendly. Just my prediction. Most online games have pets!
---
They're no companion but you can tame creatures/bots that can guard your camp
---
I was thinking about doing stealth sniper more then melee. I've always loved killing enemies from afar, plus I always have the quote one of the npcs say in fallout NV "the last thing you'll never see"
---
Today wa the only time I ever had vats fail on me. I was messing with boosting vats and managed to get it to 100%. A Mirelurk queen is no more than 40ft from me. And all my ap vats hits missed and the crit hit too. 
---
I’ve noticed that if you vats and try to fire or swing really quickly it misses. But that’s just input times on the server/client. But 100% and blanks. 
---
I can see a lot of merit in that, but "most kills" feels exclusionary and weeds out the participants that can likely use the rewards the most.  If you already have a bloodied/explosive or instigating/explosive weapon to take out enemies incredibly fast, your net gain from being "extra" is much smaller than a lvl 40 player with nothing special that would probably be much more excited to land a 1 star anti-armor combat shotgun.  I got a [TSE combat shotgun](https://imgur.com/farXOXa) from a horde event today, and just said "neat-o" to myself before getting a screenshot and tossing it in the stash bin in case a friend wanted it.  I realized how jaded I was immediately.  Myself in December would have flipped his wig.
---
Nothing annoys me more than wandering around a Whitesprings nuke with a couple team-mates and having "that guy" slightly ahead of us with an instigating super sledge or TSE gatling zerging around and taking everything for himself.  I'm stomping right behind them in a purple and blue power armor suit with hello emotes, so they're clearly aware that I'm trying to get a slice of the pie, but they just don't care.  It fully ruins the entire nuke for me and my two pals.
---
I like the Fertile Soil idea a lot, because it encourages group play, and no one has any advantage with power creep, aside from Speed Demon mutation or Gun Runner perk.  A lvl 30 with a decent perk loadout is going to one-shot lvl 1-9 enemies the same as a lvl 200.
---
I'd prefer a system where there's a "health bar" that depletes as the event continues and the faster the participants can complete the goals, or completing with no damage or repairs to equipment, the better the overall rewards will be.  One Violent Night, Line In The Sand, Fertile Soil, Uranium Fever, Enclave events and even Scorched Earth would all benefit from a "flawless victory" approach and encourage team play in a PvE setting.
---
If you want to dominate other players and show off your girthy gun, Bethesda just made an entirely new mode for you to do so.  I'd like to see the standard adventure mode gear a bit more towards cooperative play.  There can be plenty of white knuckle moments trying to beat a common enemy, and the high five afterglow of completing something difficult as a team is tough to beat.
---
I found my set at a raider bot. Not sure which.
---
A close look at the left leg and we can see it's is similar to the legs of sentry bots. 
---
I believe he is a new encounter, probably added with wild Appalachia. I started seeing him lots after the Nukashine quest came out and my character is constantly running into him and being harassed.
---
Yeah, one found me and I  waited for it to do something, anything...but it just kept following me around so I  shot it.
---
Stealth builds are pretty good, doesn't matter if meele or range. 
---
I say triple the night time spawn rate and make it difficult enough you pretty much NEED a full team to make it through the night. 
---
I beginning to think I just need some kinda build mode that's separate from everything like survival and adventure.
---
It spawns no enemies, thirst, and hunger are turned off, the player character camera isn't locked and just floats around.....
---
I guess I just want Creative Minecraft but in the fallout universe.
---
Love the idea of having a room/camp at the whitespring.  I’d definitely spend some atoms on the decor.  Not sure how it could be implemented though?  I would have thought it would be difficult for the game to ensure that the room you got is kept.
---
I meant the sloth loot. That wasnt scaled.
---
Had like 15 players in a blast zone at white springs today, explosions and Gatling guns had my game looking like a PowerPoint presentation, on Xbox X too
---
A box of shooting targets 
---
We Scorpios will always be here.  And we're always rad.
---
Survival is mandatory, nothing else.
---
Fair. 
---
I agree. I wouldn’t necessarily want kill count. But at least something that shows “hey I was here and I did something to help”. Take the scorched earth event. Adding a very simple board would be cool
---
Top hits on the SBQ
---
Most creatures killed
---
Most player healed
---
Least damage taken
---
Little stuff to try and best. Yeah some is a no brainer. You have explosive anything and you have most hits. So on so forth. 
---
As for Whitespring nukes. Go after the main force has done their work. I find I get my best stuff then
---
I know how you feel the pie thing. We had a nuke on Xbox the other day and two full team brought PA and used them block off the golf club for a full 60s. Sadly everything was dead. 
---
Ended up just finishing the quest! :) but im on ps4
---
G2A is a grey market site, and although it's generally fine if you purchase from one of their resellers, you can also end up with a dodgy key. In cases like that, developers can (and sometimes will) revoke access to the game. Contact G2A's support, for sure, because Bethesda will almost definitely not help you in this situation.
---
Thanks for the help everyone! I ended up getting one by completing the quest.
---
Yeah, no. We aren't turning survival into adventure mode plus. If you don't like the risk, or can't have someone watch your back when trading, stay in adventure mode. Leave survival to the people enjoying it who want it.
---
Yeah but then it gives false hope that there’s actually nuka colas in there, at least when they’re open I know someone already snatched them.
---
As an ex-smoker, I find all the cigarettes a bit of a trigger - like I honestly feel like a smoke after finding them everywhere. And they're totally passive. 
---
Nope. It’s nice to do as it’s sets up the game around you. But you really aren’t force to do it. Maybe in the future as dlc comes out that requires you to do it maybe then. But as it is now no. 
---
I rock the cowboy daily pandna

Over 24 hours now, still going strong :) love spring break and love the game!

Loud and proud cowboy or hush hush cowboy?

Well, they wanted a taller army - who can blame them?
---
According to another post on here, somebody's camp was in that area for a while previously and it got forcibly moved due to the new policy on disallowing camps in areas that will be used for future content. So, they must be new. Best guess is it's gonna be related to the Sheepsquatch or Pioneer Scout stuff.
---
It spawns in the golfclub at ws . The guy in the wheelchair has it
---
Thank you, did not know you had to be holstered. Thought you just couldnt shoot. That explains a lot.
---
How do we access the WS bunker if we don't do quest for that?
---
Hmm still i don’t understand why I haven’t had this problems with fallout4 ... idk
---
It also seems there is no solution to my problem and I got to reinstall windows :/
---
&gt; Although wouldn’t it be cool to have a fallout game set in a different country for once
---
fallout and america are inextricable 
---
Holy shit man.
---
I’ve seen some level 1 players get babysat for the quest. I assume they just stumble one the quest. Right place wrong time thing. But I could mistaken 
---
There were six when my buddy was trying to do it when he was level 30 or so. I was around level 50 and I didn't have a fancy build(i just leveled as I pleased and didn't know about the build stuff online) but I did hoard stims because I had a hard time not getting hit when charging at things with a ski sword. So I just kited them more or less away from him and he went down into the cavern.
---
While he toiled away on the quest I set about clearing the field.
---
Probably the most fun I had fighting SBs 
---
Dissentry
---
Vats are a part of fallout, there are plenty of other PvP games out there without a function like vats. If you were to take it out then a lot of perks would need to get re-worked and it just wouldn’t be a fallout game imo.
---
Easy way to do the quest one is take a workshop and then defend it. It also works for events, that's how I got mine completed the past two times 
---
Yeah as long as you have the points ready for other builds in the right special you can swap to new styles and swap back. 
---
Creature attractant recipe Creature deterrent recipe Growth enhanced recipe Growth suppressor recipe.
---
What do I do with these?
---
I feel you greatly. That’s why I play a stealth shooter. Hope to get the first and only shot on them before they get in your face and stab you a bunch. 
---
Some plans/recipes vendors don't sell or are silly expensive...I've got a couple  Radaway recipes that I've found through out my travels, mentat recipes, multiple Deep Pocket plans...other limb/torso plans that vendors don't really sell...
---
I'm not entirely sure if junk decoration will be a thing. The only specific reference I can find in the Wild Appalachia notes is "use items from your stash to decorate your CAMP," but there's another post that specifies "the ability to showcase items such as weapons and bobbleheads in display cases and racks." There's a chance we'll get junk decoration, but don't get your hopes up too high. I really, really hope that it'll be introduced at some point, but I'm hesitant to get too excited until we know for sure.
---
Planters would be even better, or a "foundation" made of dirt to plant stuff in.

I ran across the cave in the East that gets you on the path before I got to that point in the "main quest." It is very possible. 
---
Theres no armor on the builds that's why dying is happen.
---
I basically lost all interest in the challenges because of that. It’s just not fun at all in my opinion, especially not for like 3 weeks in a row...
---
Cheers!
---
I kinda laughed a lil bit
---
I mean it tells you on the home screen you’ll lose your junk and some aid items, I don’t say this to be mean but maybe read the instructions before you do something. 
---
I laughed way to much at this comment. Thanks for making my afternoon.
---
Yeah but it tells you when you click survival mode, it tells you all the rules and asks you if you still want to continue. It’s alright to skip it and not read but that diminishes people’s sympathy when the OP comes in here to complain.
---
My understanding is there is no way to tell if an item is duped
---
Lewisburg spawns them for me sometimes, sometimes it’s ghouls tho 
---
What level are you? 
---
I drop them in camps I visit while out and about, as little thank yous for being there.  Nice to be able to "rest" and get "well tuned" while away from my camp.
---
I blew up a radiation trap today, my ears are still ringing. I’m hoping it was a big but it was loud and went on forever lol
---
It sounds cool. But this relies on people actually wanting to sell them. Despite needing the gun people are very clearly still using them and probably have no desire to sell them to the game for a boss. 
---
You're welcome. This was a lesson that I had to learn the hard way. I would just fast travel unholstered unintentionally without thinking about about the differences between Adventure Mode and Survival. It wasn't until watched a level 21 player escape from spawn campers that I realized why. 
---
that would be me :)
---
The fast mat doesn't work most times for workshops. 
---
I picked it, gathered water and fast travelled....
---
When I went back and did it a second time it didn't all spoil.
---
Yeah but just make it so that any two shot explosive would count toward having a spawn happen.  
---
  
---
I've not played the game yet but.. how many legit TSE weapons are out there do you think? Something like 1 to 10 duped? Maybe more like 1 to 3?
---
There is but it’s all on be metadata and id tags in the games creation engine. That’s more of dev thing  
---
just a heads up, it's Arktos Pharma being marked, not Gauley Mine
---
I can't even snap a wall because the game thinks it's floating. 
---
So they Did a full release early access? That's just stupid as fuck and you know it. I had no issue with what content they spoke of. But the game ran like shit. One of the worst. 
---
The game was fun and all. But fuck it ran like shit. 
---
Yeeeesssssss.
---
Well done; you're doing it right!
---
I am, 7years.  It can only harm you if you let it.  it's a video game. drinks aren't real it's just a buff, not real life.
---
And make low level players unable to play pvp by plasing a 10k bounty on them
---
It’s probably higher. They say they got rid of the bulk of them. But I firmly believe there are more out there we haven’t counted for. 
---
They haven't been working for me as of late. When I fast travel it always puts me just outside even though the mat is well within the workshop limits with no conflicts. 
---
I would be remiss if I didn't also tell you that the invulnerability period doesn't last that long. If you hang around, weapon holstered or not, your name tag ahead your head will turn from white to red. 
---
Totally agree... the current version forces PvP on you instead of having it come naturally.
---
I would honestly prefer not having a leaderboard at all but instead have more rewarding loot zones that incentivize players to be in the same area as each other.
---
This is an excellent idea and would even decrease server load and memory storage requirements compared to mules.
---
Thanks for the info. I have a huge amount of chems (I have a level 325, 111, and multiple lvl 40-70s, and I've kept ALL the chem drops I've gotten) stored on a mule, so it might be viable. I really wish you didn't lose addictions on log out though. That seems really short sighted, both in terms of making chems have more risk, making addictol actually worth something, and of course to make junkies weapons a lot more viable.
---
With the amount of cigarettes in this game I don't know how you manage. 
---
Before making accusations like that you should go to the bottom of it.
---
Contact Bethesda first =&gt; https://help.bethesda.net/
---
No with hunting here
---
I already had worked it out but thats a great video man 🙏
---
maybe but it would cost you 20k caps to do it, and you would only get 10k back.
---
I have maxed out slugger and gladiator, and also pistols. I’m using gladiator atm, but if I want to use two handed weapons I can just replace the whole lot with slugger. Pistols are a bit more problematic as they fall under a different special, so I’d have to do some more restructuring to switch back to that.
---
Its a quest item, can't be split, dropped or sold, unless you have not done the BOS quest that unlocked Forbidden Knowledge. (This is on PC, can't comment on console)
---
To some degree I'd be interested to see just how much of an effect I had on the SBQ, but it still feels a little self serving.  As much damage as I may have done with an anti-armor/explosive handmade rifle or AA/SS super sledge (depending on which character I'm playing), if everyone else stopped shooting I'd have no chance of taking out the queen on my own, no matter how great my gear is.  It's a community effort and I don't love the idea of an MVP.  It ruined conventional team sports and created the modern idea of superstars, and I don't think 76 desperately needs that in adventure mode.  As a feature in competitive survival mode sure.  Have at it.  The whole idea of that mode is competition in one form or another.
---
If we had a record of #1 full server team that took down SBQ with 23:33 left with a list of participants, that would be very cool and really impressive.  Or a razor's edge record of .001 seconds left, that would be even more amazing.  Who doesn't like a hail mary victory?
---
Building a very powerful character is relatively easy, but building a 4 player team that can work together very well is really, really hard.  The end results are well worth it.  Coordinating a server of players with area chat is like herding cats.  That's an achievement to be very proud of.
---
Yeah what this guy said, it’s the perks causing the stagger and the explosive just makes more of your shots connect.
---
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaas!!!!!
---
Which skeleton mask? There's the halloween one that's in the base game.
---
Anyway, they probably got it from a dev room.
---
&gt;The same for world spawn plans if you dont touch them aka you know them or dont want that plan dont loot them. when you hop servers it has the chance to spawn again and be different.
---
Are the world plans instanced to the player? i.e if someone else picks them up in their game can you still see them?
---
I actually like the leader boards. My only gripe is that there are some people who join survival mode just to hold themselves up in their impenetrable camps to make the leader boards. 
---
you shouldnt drop lockpicks imo
---
But survival time being what determines the ranking is literally the only think that keeps the survival mode from being a PvP arena. The devs should reinforce the survival part, and keep the game mode away from endless trainstation camping
---
Understandable. 
---
well it would help to have your gt
---
That's what happens when you buy from grey market. Should have spent the full amount like the rest of us. The dev's deserve it.
---
I have so much ammo or regularly drop 2k 10mm and 130 40mm, 100+ missiles (they are worthless). And countless of .44 and .38, 1k+ fusion. And that is the ammo I don't make.
---
Its also a risk free way to go stash the hundreds of pounds of loot people keep dropping me.
---
That's interesting. Why do you say that? Your comment kind of sparked my curiosity. 
---
Fair enough, makes sense. I had a moment where I was concerned, because of how frequently they were making it a priority for Atoms.
---
You've put my fear at semi-ease for those experienced with recovery. I had a chip on my shoulder, I guess, for those who might be in early recovery. That's all.
---
Heh, I sold a few to vendors before I knew better.
---
Having Gatling gun for everyday use is the only way to make a heavy weapons build viable. Mining  for lead in lucky hole mine while wearing excavator armor will give you a shit ton of lead.  Wiping out super mutants at west tech and scrapping their weapons with scrapper equipped will give you a generous helping of steel. 
---
After acquiring insane amounts of lead and steel from that, Super duper and ammo smith will get you generous helpings of ammo. 
---
Ammo factory is pretty much a bust for heavy weapons.  It seems to produce ammo fairly quickly for the handmade, but it's slow as hell for 5 mm and .50 cal. And I think it gets contested by other players more than any other factory. So you take the ammo factory, the likelihood for PVP is pretty high. And it doesn't produce cryo ammo at all as far as I know. 
---
I'll search this evening.
---
Lol. Like a homesless guy. 
---
If you do NOT have the quest, yes, they stack and it tells you how many you have, once you get the quest they seem to combine into 1, complete the quest and they are all gone.  I've been handing them off to a mule, when the time comes I'll go to the turn in location and have the mule join me there, and get them back from the mule one at a time to turn in.
---
"You can tame them from the first day" , not Cats and Dogs, otherwise people would have been posting here &amp; YouTube about it along time ago.
---
Other creatures yes, Cats and Dogs no. 
---
Unless im proven wrong.
---
I think this is some of the things they want to do, and probably will, down the line. Just have patience. 
---
I know we want everything and right now, but let the game live a little. This would be a major feature, worthy of it's own content. Remember the 3 T's, things takes time. 
---
This happens to me a lot, but lately I'll be on the server all by myself for hours until out of nowhere spawns would die right in front of me without me hitting them then all of a sudden there's people around killing everything and the server is full. 
---
You can bet your last caps Whitespring Station is covered
---
Nice
---
I had a full budget when i Tamed her, it used to be 10% before the last patch, not sure of the specifics after patch.
---
I think it's a common thing with developers to not expect players to get sick of things / advance as fast as they do.  I'm sure this will be adjusted.  It will probably have to come in a patch.  Just ignore it for now?  GAMES AS A SERVICE, AND ALL. :-)
---
It’s the kind of apparel you can wear for a hundred lvls, no prob
---
I think you'll miss out on a lot of plans. Or do you get those from the overseers quest line?
---
They also said they increased the spawn/teleport protection timer but you die b4 you can move if someone is camping the spot as you noticed.
---
I soooo much agree with the OP. The leaderboard should SERIOUSLY not be based on survival time, it should instead be based on player kills.   
---
I'm vastly disappointed that this is how the leaderboards are going to work, and I don't think that I'm really going to bother with Survival mode at all :(  
---
I was hoping for a plain intense survival experience where I could play the base game with the freedom to either avoid/escape (run, hide, sneak), or actively partake in open pvp. Not a game mode where I will be painted a target on for surviving 'too long'  
---
Please reconsider this Bethesda
---
I'll elaborate: not too long ago, we used to get games and they were fairly static.  Even MMOs, they stayed the same for a long time.
---
FO76 has changed a lot in a short 4-5 months.  We like that, right?  That means we also have to put up with the fact that ideas come fast and loose, and sometimes they aren't perfect.
---
Most people don't understand, because they haven't worked in the IT field.  It's amazing the amount of engineering that goes into these things.
---
This post could be applied to 80% of gamer attitudes these days, but I saved it **just for you guys**, cuz I love FO76 and I know you do too.
---
Be patient.  (it's a video game)
---
This happens on every server you enter. They stop sending players there, to shut the server down after everybody leaves. Because world loot don't respawn, and the world don't have to be consistent when there is so few players on each server. 
---
So if you stay long enough, you always end up alone. 
---
Hehe...I made it to the top of the leaderboard by trying something new because I wanted to see if it would work. I hid in the water...for almost three hours :-)
---
I had this issue earlier today (although i bought my key legit from beth).
---
The play button was not available from the launcher (blue box with no "play" writing in it).
---
I simply closed the beth launcher completely, ensuring it wasn't in my hidden icons, and then reopen the launcher and it was back and i was able to play again.
---
I only play this game drunk.
---
As someone who played since beta, not to toot my own horn, but was definitely among the heads of the pack on level, caps and quality of equipment.... it is like 1 real to 100’s or more of duped, in fact I believe the majority of the duplications  have rooted from like 4 or 5 of each type of gun, so a total of 2-300 guns. The duped ones are just all the same... and they were. So. Rare. Like getting a two shot explosive roll was a big fucking deal, I paid 15k caps for a 2* TSE combat shotgun lvl 25, and I got a steal, then three weeks later TSE’s were everywhere in a matter of days. 
---
They deleted the duplicates within banned people’s inventories, but by then, so many people had  a few duplicated guns, there are plenty to circulate around, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down. 
---
No to both. 
---
Now all I want is a reprogrammed infiltrator buddy
---
As long as they remove explosive legend effect aswell i wouldn't mind, but there are by far more pressing issues.
---
Thank you for seeing our feedback! I truly hope that this will change, leaderboards should strictly be pvp kills in my opinion. Maybe there is still hope!
---
Sound like a good time. My problem with pvp in this game is that it’s so jarring. You tank pve all day (essentially) and then you want to fight a player and you (or they) are dead in seconds. It’s a lvl 1 scorched with a one hit gun. Ok. That’s the game. 
---
That'll be an upcoming challenge
---
I love the vid and for some odd reason I love Waste Virginia even more😂
---
That would be great. If you unlock them all you could get a plan to display them or something, too. 
---
I recently just scanned over the entire map looking for this exact thing, and I could've sworn I saw a workshop or two with both lead and steel, but can't remember which ones. I think maybe Lakeside Cabins workshop has both lead and iron (aka steel), but I'm not certain. It may be lead and silver. Only one I'm certain of is the lead cause I claim Lakeside Cabins often strictly for the lead. I'll have to double check when I'm not so tired cause I may have very well just been imagining things, LoL.
---
Yes - my camp was just nw of this. At first I thought it was part of the containment unit in the "it's a trap" event but its not - or might be similar for sheepsquatch

Two I can think of offhand: in Camden Park near the Nuka cola plant and another behind avr medical center Charleston.

I have had to rebuild entire stupidly large builds literally more than a dozen times because of stupid shit with staircases.
---
It is my one true hate button in this game, I can ignore broken quests, dumb ai, and disconnects all day long, but to have like 12 straight hours grinding build materials and putting it all together, (no i didn't take 12 hours to grind mats) flushed down the drain because of **ONE FUCKING STAIRCASE!!!?!**
---
Really rustles my jimmies you know?😶
---
Find the corpse of the lady, one is behind AVR Medical I think. I found another in the charleston Trainyard on a railing near the edge of the dried riverbed (NOTE: lvl 10 Grafton Monster spawns nearby sometimes).
---
I’ve launched approximately 16 Nukes in the past 6 days. Of those 16, my game crashed after I fast traveled to the zone 3 times. I’m also on Xbox. That’s 18% of the time. 
---
Though I agree that it’s a problem, considering how unstable the game USED to be a month or so ago, I consider a 18% crash rate after launching a nuke to be tolerable. 
---
But definitely not great. 
---
I would like to purchase the mod for 2k if possible
---
Thank you very much. I was hoping it was almost black. Still too green for me ;)
---
But only in Tandem with an actual Chat or else you are bound to run into a Situation where you dont find a Fitting Phrase and then you are stuck with the emote-charade again :p
---
That sucks. Helped a guy earlier when some of them were attacking his camp 
---
Oh I was just there! I must've missed it. Thank you :)
---
Can also find a lady in the Charleston capital building to start it 
---
West Tek levels to the player. I’ve traveled to west tek and found myself surrounded by level 5-10 supers wondering why then looked at the map and saw a level 20 closeby. 
---
Though normally it is Level 68’s, if you get there before anyone else, it will level to you. 
---
Well there's a camp static items coming in, so I'm collecting all the teddies to display in my camp
---
I had such a lovely camp on the eastern cliffs but this kept happening to me because, I believe, I was close enough to a fissure site that I was on some kind of "flight path".
---
Grafton steel, has a lead extractor too. Your welcome.
---
Everyone says you need wasteland whisper but you don’t. I’ve tamed 3 mega sloths and more without the perk, but you do need rank 3 animal friend.
---
story i want a story
---
Yes, I’ve noticed more than a few of those crashes lately. I’m also on Xbox, but I thought it was because my Xbox One is a 1st Gen (Huge 80’s VCR cabinet) and it just getting old. 
---
Dammit Microsoft. Why can I fit 3 PS4’s inside your damn Xbox cabinet. 
---
To quote Conan O’Brien: “(the Pip Boy) is the Microsoft version of the Apple Watch”

Truer words have not been spoken.

It would also be nice to get can clean version of the warehouse, that's something I'd pay atoms for.

Events are a serious issue since they're forced respawn. If someone enters an event area and quits the event they can PvP anyone in the event. When an event participant dies, they automatically respawn in the event, only to be killed immediately. 
---
Complete 3 Daily Challenges and launch 1 Nuke while intoxicated IN REAL LIFE
---
nani?

💯 this is needed!
---
This map works very well.  💪💪
---
I've gotten Lead Champagne Mimosa 3 times but I've not gotten Lead Champagne yet, which is required to make the Mimosa...
---
It doesn't help that some of the dailies (and weeklies) have been  including things that are down to pure RNG in getting...Like crafting X amount of different alcoholic beverages, meanwhile I don't even have half of the recipes and I can only see Biv once a day.
---
From what I’ve read and seen footage of. People are dying faster but not one hit quicker.  As much I as I dislike the use of the explosive effect. The AAE I feel would serve better. Bloodied would require you to be low to get the most bang for your buck. And the name of the game is surviving.
---
But someone more informed is probably better to give advice. 
---
When I was low level, I claimed a ton of workshops. You get pretty good XP just for claiming and immediately following is a defend mission. DON’T USE TURRETS. You don’t get xp for turret kills. Kill the enemies yourself and get xp from them then you get a decent amount again once the defense is over. 
---
This xp is minuscule once you be one higher level, but early on, it will level you rather quickly. 
---
After that, I just started Legendary farming at WS. Got to level 100 pretty quick. 
---
Now I’m 211 and am starting to do events finally. And one day I may finally complete the main quest. 
---
I use a tiny piece colored clear screen safe tape. Until a time that it’s corrected. 
---
Why?! Who hurt you?
---
Most of these comcerns are not reasonable and the only common one is solving the spawn-protection times.
---
Rules have changed and people still play by the old ones.
---
I'm going to see the third one on may 17th. :D
---
Check the spreadsheet in this post https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2n39c/this_spreadsheet_shows_which_legendary_effects/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I play this as I'm getting drunk. I think it counts...
---
Im looking for the list of armor sets only, no weopons.
---
If you've pre loudly read the plan and find it again it will be marked as (Known).
---
If it is marked as (known) it is safe to drop and there will be no issues for you.
---
If it is not marked as (known) you should click on it to read it and unlock that plan, it will then disappear from your inventory and if you find it again later will have the (known) demarcation.
---
Holy crap that's solid info I had no idea. Thanks! That makes things easier as a sniper
---
Can't you just make a second character, do the challenge, then go back to your high level character? It's really easy to level up 3 times as a newbie, and you can twink like hell in this game.
---
You know I agree, but every time I hear him hacking and growling through the floor, I just can’t resist sneaking down through the toilets and slamming him up against the lockers.
---
What's the best way to get caps?
---
I think that you think you know what my concerns are. They are not what you have listed. I'm not looking to get dragged into a flame war so if you don't have an answer to my question, please don't be that guy.
---
Right now this is how it is:
---
Lost of weapons that were usless are now shredding people.
---
Stealth sniper is mandatory for each PvP team.
---
From what I've heard (I dont use vats much), is that vats crit weps are better on single shot weps, but that's still a pretty cool gun
---
I use butchers bounty when collecting them.
---
But I also use Chemist and super duper when making the blood packs and still packs.
---
I normally have 200 on me at any given time with another 70-80 wasting away in my stash.
---
Add me on PSN at radiationdaddy - I should be on some time in the afternoon, US EST time. 
---
I want a mister gutsy who shouts anti communism propaganda at my enemies 
---
There's also a chance when using butchers bounty that even if they already dropped tick blood they can drop more. I've had it happen once or twice.
---
The Vampire effect on a heavy weapon is really good, but that VATS roll on that particular gun isn't the greatest.
---
Oh that sounded differently what I meant so please rethinj after I'll rephrase.
---
My point is: we knew stuff, some people knew more, other knew less. Now the rules were changed heavily and people who play by the old ones are shocked. The truth is that all previous assumptions are obsolete and hence most of the concerns are unreasonable.
---
By saying that most of the concerns were unreasonable I wasn't attempting to say "you suck", I re-read that again and agree this is valid interpretation and am sorry for that. What I wanted to say is that the rule of thumb is that people now know shit and I say that based on the hundreds of hours I spent researching PvP AND by the obvious conclusion that I now know shit too.
---
Sorry again and happy hunting.
---
Okay. Thanks for answering. How much you think someone would pay? I know this is very situational. Just a general ballpark?
---
I got and lost a quad pump shotgun today, I’m not even quite sure what happened.  
---
Give us lock! 
---
Oh hell no. Dont buy microtransactions period if you’ve already paid for the game. 
---
My recommendation is focused on the spacing issues between plants but yeah a planter would be nice and this suggestion would be beneficial
---
Good Idea man!
---
Today I looted a dog helmet off something, is this drop like a normal thing? I was really perplexed by it
---
They’re juvenile and stupid. 
---
Yeah you can find dog armor and dog helmets. It's been around since the beginning
---
You got it. I'm in work now (UK) but let me know your GT and I'll message you to organise when we can meet 
---
We don't know what the actual issue is with large STASH sizes, so this might not help with anything. Presumably the issue is the size of the STASH data for each player, although you can fit an infinite number of 0 weight items in it so maybe not. To fix it permanently they would need to change how items are stored, but that would take quite some time to rearchitect the inventory system.
---
Oh okay sick, I just haven’t seen it!
---
Pretty sure it's just a status save issue. Junkie's has been bugged for quite a while and it's only starting to get fixed now. I'm not sure how you could run this build in survival mode, but I think it's wholly viable in adventure mode
---
I’ve noticed the discover locations challenges are broken too, really sucks
---
Now you need a mod to bring Piper to FO76 so she can call you Blue all over again
---
My only explosive is a Furious handmade with faster movement speed while ADS. I've only had the game since...Februaryish? So, I never knew the OPness of TSE weapons...I just thought it was fun as hell to use...Friend bought it off of a vendor for some measly 600 Caps, I traded him a stimpak recipe for it.
---
Where's the hint? In the vault boy informational videos? Because this old we games' videos had an arm growing out of his stomach when irradiated but I never expected that in game either 
---
I have played drunk a few times 
---
1.2k, good luck 😂
---
I would keep all 3* even if they're junk for the upcoming legendary vendor (it's sometimes in may).
---
Also in about 2 weeks we're getting player shops, so there's another chance of selling low/mid tier stuff.
---
They want an increased STASH size but they also don't want you to be able to hold an infinite amount of crafting material. The junk weight also helps keep the number of entries down. There is an issue they have overlooked, zero weight items like holotapes. They don't stack, so you can just keep dumping them in your inventory if you want.
---
This is what the mire should be like in the current game, make me scared to go there at night, counterbalanced by the beauty of the day. 
---
Yeah I am wondering the same thing. I am a fan of this map and I will be using it. But the main reason I found it was because I was looking for a map pin pointing the crafting stations. The reason was because I was in watoga, there are a lot of buildings with a lot of floors but not many of them seem to have a crafting station, the closest one I know is at the train station which is not very close at all. There very well could be more crafting stations in watoga that I could not find.
---
who is dickhead and why do we care about his videos?
---
I believe it’s a mob life timer. How long the are mobs can exist in that world space. 
---
Many a time I’ve lost a 3* legendary to the timer and it’s just hunches over and doesn’t give me the kill.

Ohh I miss read. I thought you are talking "localized" as like inside the game site, like "location". Like only one location where everyone can set up vendor :P 
---
Screenshot?
---
It’s in the resort tables plan sold in whitesprings 
---
Yeh the stealth Sniper is dominating Pvp. Hands down. Rifle builds all together really but the snipers are racking up kills, especially the campers. 
---
yea I get what you mean, I actually made a little garden with corn and razorgrain, because of the new update, I hate not being able to cluster the razorgrain. and where I do have it, half of it floats.
---
Well, I dont have a mule. My stash would fill up real fast if I hang on to everything. Specially heavy stuff. Weightless 3\* are golden atm. Anyhow, we dont know how that vendor is gonna work yet. Will be very exciting and it might change this game fundamentally, as the loot grind is pretty much all there is right now. 
---
Are we getting player vending in just two weeks?! Thats pretty huge as well :-)
---
I agree even the wendigo that spawns at the event where you have to keep music playing for a while till the boss comes.
---
Even that wendigo is weak I think.
---
Boss enemies that are Lvl 68 or whatever should be super tough.
---
You can take down a mirelurk queen with the right unyielding and melee buffs to 2 hit a queen dead with a gauntlet or a combat knife 
---
having an ED-E in game would be amazing...
---
It's not an engine issue, it's a database issue. They can fix the client needing to load all data by only loading needed data. They could even load data that's only currently on your screen, so at any one time you'll have something like 20 entries loaded. However, this would cause an even larger number of calls to the database.
---
There's also the issue with workstations being able to see into your inventory. It's not a simple check for the number, it actually loads the data to see what's in there. We know this because workstations are able to junk items, which it would not be able to do if there was just a running tally of the base crafting material you have. I don't know why it auto junks things, if you want to junk items wouldn't the player just manually do it? If I'm saving a coffee cup I don't want the game to auto junk it, I might be saving it for the update that lets me display junk items.
---
It’s because you’re doing it wrong. Make a new character, or stop bringing 70 radaway 80 stimpacks and a pet rock to a fight. The spawn camping can get annoying, but you know what you’re getting into when you travel to vault 76.
---
I’ve gotten a couple good legendary item from it. Nothing to really write home about. But I think the creature as a whole needs a buff. Their supposed to be this terror but act like more crazy humans than anything. 
---
Maybe a heavy bleed attack would be cool. But I don’t fear them as much as I did In the early stages. 
---
Thank you! 
---
Hope it is helpful to people who don't know how to do it yet. 
---
Grahm will usually have them
---
Even better lol
---
Love it lol
---
with the option to paint it to the faction of your choosing....or plastering it with Nuka Cola stickers.
---
I just made a post about those challenges. I'm guessing we need to get noisey if we what them fixes. 
---
Indeed 👍
---
Ah  yeah i can understand that i hope they make it so we can have a type of air based camp in the future with giant balloons
---
Man, that traveling didn't waste your caps at all. Right now you travel whole day between stations and you don't even feel the caps going down.
---
My stash is already full with 3* stuff, i keep selling my junk for more space. Way easier to get more junk than it is to get more 3* items. I don't have a mule either, well, i'm the mule. Running around with a full stash and 600 pounds on myself... I can't even remember the last time when i was able to actually sprint...
---
&gt;Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams. 
---
It's safe to assume that if you sacrifice 3* items you have more chances of getting what you want.
---
This SHED would be duped to death by some players.
---
I've had the opposite issue where, when I'm using my rifle, if I vats and fire nearly immediately at the same time I can hit enemies even through some walls.
---
Werent the Gatorclaws a pre-war attraction? Could explain the lore when we get one of those suits, even though I’m not too sure about the timeline between Appalachia and Nuka-World.
---
It’s not just Xbox, it’s happening to me on ps4 too
---
Bloodied, I genuinely find AA garbage. I can 1 shot lvl 68 super mutant warlords with my handmade, my Lever one shots most things in Pvp. I played with AAE and it always took a barrage of bullets, I play in a team sometimes and the leader uses AA, I used bloodied and he's firing off 10 rounds for my 1. Depending on what gun, and Auto or Semi. But without a doubt my bloodied weapons do way better than my AA. 
---
Cool GT The Phanimal
---
Try running a new character survival only!
---
Upstairs above Biv's bar there is a pack of addictol under the desk by the computer
---
Though the percentage was only at 95 and if i wait for even a second more it'll stop to low numbers or just close out of vats(as the enemy was behind a wall) 
---
there should be nothing that makes you apear you on the map.   
---
not the amount of kills and definitly not the amount of time you survived.  
---
i was hoping for a dayz-like feeling... 
---
The database that holds character data is separate from the server you're on. Your suggestion just creates another database table that will have the exact same access issues as the STASH. If this was a viable option they would just let us create multiple independent stashes.
---
Creating a completely separate database instead of a table is not viable as they still have to talk to each other to make changes as the player moves items between the STASH and SHED. There are also sync issues that have to be dealt with if one database hitches while the other one is going along fine. There's potential for making performance worse as the databases have to wait on each other, which eats up valuable resources.
---
There was some cursory mention of this maybe two/three patches ago?
---
Basically a 'we have acknowledged that this is an issue[ish] and set no specific timeframe for a fix, just the vague notion that probably at some point in the future it is likely to maybe be addressed so there is no need to bring it up anymore' kind of statement.
---
Having been playing since B.E.T.A. I have... a number of categories including but not only flora, recipes, locations, holotapes and the kitchen sink affected by this... feature myself.
---
I don't really look anymore; I am only kind of aware of it when something that I find appealing pops up in the Atom Shop.
---
It totally should be based on survival time, because in this way everything in leader board is balanced. With leader board being based on kills, there is no way to compete in other categories, because chances to get killed without marked on map are none existing, so basically leader board is going to be based on who ever has most time to play.
---
I honestly dont understand everyones need to constantly farm materials? Apart from concrete and copper I never had to farm anything ever. And thats with using two weapons, PA / non PA gear aswell as moving / rebuilding my camp constantly. At ~380 hours into the game.
---
I got more than 600 of each Screws, Gears, Springs, &gt;1k adhesive and &gt;100 of other rare materials. Yes my stash is full.
---
Honestly dont understand what you guys are doing with your gear
---
Whatever helps to blend in. Junk walls, actual housing quality walls (not just floors!) etc. 
---
I’d trade you for some .50 or .308!
---
Thank you for the offer but I nuked Mama Dolces and got 13 stable cobalt flux. But thank you anyway
---
I want a pet glowing wolf, or a fox. Let me have a lil' buddy to wander around with.
---
I once lost my 3* weapon during a SBQ fight, wanted to use a RadAway from the pipboy menu (Default R) but had my inventory tab open (Drop Item -&gt; default R).
---
What followed was a lot of cursing and a panic while searching for my bag...
---
It's growing on me. I quickly realized my camp isn't suitable for pvp. So I'm rebuilding it over and over perfecting it.  I kinda like the fact that once I hit number 1...some murder crazed wastelander is gonna come over the hill and show up on my doorstep. 
---
If we do it’ll probably be atom shop stuff
---
I would think like an Easter bunny version of the mole mascot head
---
I think it would be better if it was just the vanilla game with PvP enabled all the time, rather than marking you on the map just because you haven't died recently. Imagine how shitty that would feel in any popular survival game, but people here are saying it's fun. I don't get it. 
---
Great idea!
---
I’m not sure the location.  But anyone know what the red button in the portapotty does? Found that during the beta and forgot about it till this post.
---
Was hoping he'd just take the caps and leave the server. The canon ending is decent though
---
It's a secret exit from the closest nuke silo.
---
Sounds like the beginnings of Reillys rangers lol just play nice with us talon company mercs from r/falloutraiders 
---
F.
---
I like that they are adding separate modes to the game. It will allow them to do neat stuff like this. There's no limit on what they could do.
---
Yeah. I think they will want to keep the game very gindy though. When everyone have the exact gear they want people will get bored for lack of something to do and go play something else. Therefore, I suspect scrapping a gatling gun at best will give the chance to get a legenadry mod for a gatling gun - not any legendary weapon. Vendor could have a cool down as well, meaning you'll be stuck with the hoard of useless 3\* for a very long time. This all pure speculation, ofc.
---
If they are smart they will include a cap sink as well, which might help the economy and make caps actually be worth something.
---
To be fair so do I, even have a water pump and cooking station outside so people can make boiled water if the purifiers are empty.
---
I don’t know but a high dps with vampire sounds interesting. 
---
Also found a Bloodied Super Sledge on the Vendor once, 55 caps.
---
As I was trading that’s what I figured would happen.
---
What’s kinda funny is that I was flat broke so I sold another player there 4 fusion cores for 150 caps to pay for the nuka shine. 
---
Tried to add the guy as a friend and rejoin his server just to see who won, but he never accepted. 
---
Some people say the race is still going to this day. 
---
Yeah. My best vendor scoop is a 3\* TSE lever :-) 800 caps &lt;3
---
I've noticed and issue where a server will stop accepting new players. Players will log off and eventually you'll be the only person left.
---
I think with how often MilfSlayer420 killed MilfSlayer420 pops up as a notification they're counting any in-game death as a reset. I don't think it's always people killing themselves. Sometimes I've seen people show up as markers in mob dense areas.
---
We will probably get decorations like St. Patricks
---
Queen raids ill use my tse gatling, and when it starts wearing down i switch to various explosive. 50 mg. I'm a suppression gunner, just make sure to use one gun army too, it's a luck perk that staggers/ cripples with heavy guns
---
I don't see that that often
---
When are you usually on?
---
at the cem lab it says "stable flux", is that the same as pure?
---
Dang that’s dirty 
---
I have one of those if you want it, 3* 40% more power attack and +1 strength
---
Yes, I have received the BoS chest plan from the Grafton Day event. 
---
Go play fallout 4. 76 is online. Suck it up buttercup
---
like an "i'm sorry" emote?  
---
that could also be useful. 
---
one for "gift" would be good too.
---
I was thinking it's something like you get to chose what item you want  and you start at 0% chance of getting it.
---
Each * you sacrifice increases that chance by 1%(or less). It would take 33 3* items for a 100* chance.
---
Anyway, regardless of the way this legendary vendor works, i would rather have an excess of legendary items than feel sorry i didn't saved them.
---
Assassins explosive .50 with level 3 one gun army takes a lot of these twits by surprise. 
---
Yeah. Some poor guy fucked up on that. Often you can find good 1\*  weapons and good armor. A lot of people have no interest in trading and dont care. 
---
I understand, I usually see it a couple times per play thru but it can be different for different people. Still doesn’t change my belief that the build zone should be pushed back 
---
Hmm that an interesting drop on a Gatling gun. Vampires isn’t great on low fire rate weapons and no one really uses a Gatling gun without the explosive as it needs the aoe damage to make up for its low rate of fire. The crit damage and crit chance meter fill speed is a pretty decent combo though. Hard to say if it’s good or not. Since the nerf of the swing speed perk card no longer affecting it kinda dropped its popularity. Vats and heavy weapons don’t go well together and it would have to be a pretty specific build around that specific gun for it to work. I use heavy weapons and vats is really bad as it uses a ton of ap per shot. maybe three shots and my ap is gone so unless you could get the crit meter filled in two shots then crit on your third I don’t think it will be amazing. 
---
I think I have about 47 Kg of plans now in my stash so I will be estatic when player vending goes live.
---
TTHIS MAP IS AMAZING i JUST CAME OM MY PANTIES THANK YOU
---
Make a new character? And go with a sneak rifleman build, its rly fun and strong!
---
A very clever mutant.
---
It's possible to programmatically add snow. There's a Skyrim mod that does this in areas that should have built up snow but don't. I doubt it's just a simple snow texture though, they could add that to adventure mode.
---
Not disagreeing. Saw it a bit on day 1, then it became pretty easy to hunt people that were camping spawn points, so I guess it mostly worked itself out.
---
I've been trying to think what nuclear winter is. Harder to survive? No, that's for survival mode. Always nuked? No, then nobody would ever launch a nuke in adventure mode.
---
I have 2 awesome companions....Hunter of Gunmen and Morpheus GI
---
Also a riflebuild and commando build are really easy to swap between because they share so many cards :D I use commando for boss fights and rifleman for exploring :P
---
What's the main difference between the two builds and what armor to run? Again, I've spent most of the game in PA. 
---
Mine is the old oak ox with my cow out front. But my backup was the sloshed sloth.
---
Still bummed they fixed the "foundation on top of a nuke-planter" bug.
---
Anyone find something similar yet? 
---
Melee can mix well with others as it's inherently quite strong. I wouldn't bother mixing 2 gun types though, it's not really viable to distribute special points in that manner.
---
I used to enjoy travelling with Codsworth a lot back in Fallout 4. Another Mr Handy would be nice, but I'd settle for a Liberator, even if I can't understand what it's saying.
---
Right, next time for sure .. we shouldn't let players gets away with that nonsense, not cool and shame on him
---
Honestly there needs to be a game mode somewhere down the line, hardcore survival, where if someone kills you you drop all of your inventory + they can go into your stash and take stuff if your spot is unguarded 
---
Sorry. I totaly forgot about this thread. I found out that moving your camp should solve the issue. At least in my case the turret was back once I relocated the camp to a new area
---
No. When vault boy becomes a molerat-human hybrid
---
I still think the game should require all the cards in your inventory to launch instead of just knowing the codes.
---
I shall now prepare to be down voted
---
I wanna paint Rad Toad eggs and throw them at Deathclaws with bunny ears instead of horns.
---
arent they really rare? i can never find them
---

---
nigga im broke. lol
---
Here’s a trick for walls/roofs that suddenly can’t be deleted. Let’s say you’ve got a staircase coming from a foundation that connects to your second level flooring. You want to redo your floors but the furthest most 2x1 won’t delete which means every other floor between the one that don’t go away and your staircase is also not removable. 
---
If you can find some way to reconnect that same piece to either the same foundation or a new one  (maybe to new stairs or an earlier part of your flooring, whatever is just enough to fix the broken. 
---
Look up Jug on YouTube. He’s got a fix. 
---
As frustrating and wonky Camp building can be, the “bugs” have often lead to some of my most creative ideas. 
---
Or play in third person it show a dot :)
---
Find full metal armor. Mod it up and be around 410 DR. Furious handmade whenever you can find one otherwise just combat rifle with hunter backup. This is roughly what i ran on my first character when i finally figured out what i was doing. There is better rounded armor sers out there but for pure DR, level 50 ultralight alloyed metal is really hard to beat.
---
The enclave quests imo kinda hint at some future possibilities. 
---
I know it's possible, but to do so not lazily would require hand placed textures over the entire map. They could do so but it would require quite a bit of work. 
---
Though they did talk about seasons and the hardest season to implement  would be winter. And if the story advances in Summer it's currently October in game and it would be logical that in November it starts to snow.
---
Though personally I have no idea what a post-apocalyptic environment would look like this long/short after a mostly global nuking. But I assume after 25 years or so things would start to return to a normal season schedule.
---
Oh dear, He is a bit conspicuous for a peeping tom :P
---
With a pistol, I would try a build based on luck and critical VATS, there are a lot of card on agility for pistol
---
That location is practically a CAMP in disguise. It’s also my go-to lots and lots of wood 
---
Omg, that would be too perfect xD
---
what are you talking? BOS vendor is the badass boss in the game, he can even take himself the scorched queen but he too lazy to move from the super duper smart
---
You mean 1 burn. Because congratz! you just inhale 3,000 fuel. XD
---
No YOU wanna play as a Snallygaster! ;P
---
how the fuck?
---
Animal friend rank 3. (Not wasteland whisperer as some claim, I dont have it and i still tamed a bunch of animals)
---
*Downvotes you by a hundred points*
---
The Nuke Launch is a bit too easy just time intensive. Butt it rewards very little aside from being an unlock mechanism. 
---
That would be super handy in the upcoming Nuclear Winter! Think of how cosy your feathers will be! :)
---
I have exactly zero sets of power armour :)
---
I tried having a megasloth. It was big and cute and all, but its constant howling drove me insane. Have a deathclaw now, sure it makes noises but it isnt nearly as loud.
---
Nothing triggers me more while I'm close to leveling up past 100, and I'm not paying attention to how close I am to the next level. Then all of the sudden while I'm doing some random event I forget to drink a beer 1 xp before I level up and get no credit for that level 3 times challenge. Something so damn time consuming should be a weekly. Not to mention I can't even finish some Mix it Up weeklys because I still haven't unlocked enough mixed drinks after doing like 20 biv quests. 
---
I agree its way to easy to drop nukes in this game. A nuke being dropped should be a big thing but instead its just "I need to level up! Oh well thats fine I will simply go and drop the most devastating weapon known to man on some hotel. No big deal."
---
Thank you kindly, it was a labour of love xD
---
whitesprings golf field are pretty big there is room for 24 camp if need it but not everyone will make their camp there. 
---
Those places with water or some resources will be more contested but you can still find some green place behind the golf club near some entrances
---
YAAYYYYY! Marshmallows!
---
Commando is automatic rifles, chews up alot of ammo but does a lot of damage, even more if you use stealth sneak bonus damage, I personally only use commando for what I consider boss fights, such as, the queen, normal scorchbeasts, ECT. 
---
Rifleman is semi-automatic, uses less ammo but less damage per second, same sneak bonus helps very much, I use an istagating lever action, hoping to get an instigating gauss rifle, which allows me to do 900+ damage with a single bullet if the enemy is at full health and I'm sneaking, I can kill almost every non boss enemy with a single bullet, I use this build when wandering around the wastes.
---
For amour I recommend Chameleon, because the invisible stealth effect stacks with each piece so when the game is working properly enemy's have a real hard time finding you. 
---
Good example: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rDgD4jHbbkk 
---
Can we get a text summary of the technique?
---
 Also, who cares if some kid has been alive for 12 hours while holed up inside a concrete fortress or on a floating tower? He's getting literally nothing out of that
---
Have you paid for the DLCs though?  
---
I dont mind that theres micro transaction but the cost of atoms for what you get for them is crazy
---
At first I thought you meant the loud, obnoxious, “crash into the earth” power armor sound that apparently is not made by footsteps....
---
But why is it so wrong wanting to support it?  
---
I get that it's obviously a controversial discussion by the down votes, but I want this game to survive and do good. I think they have been very generous with the atom shop so far, without me needing to spend a dime.. And they are barely focusing on the shop, just a few new items a week which you can get most for free by doing you dailies and weekly and waiting for sales. That's hardly any greedy-cashgrab-shop. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I dont want harder daily or weekly challenges. I just want more items in the shop to actually spend my atom on, but I guess I'm in the small minority group on that one.
---
I don’t know man, just went on a survival server with and some dude has been alive for 11hours. 
---
Lol ok. 
---
I can't wait to be able to use that Sheepsquatch costume from the Wild Appalachia trailer. I could see something similar looking with a goofy Death Claw head like the Sheepsquatch one. 
---
Maybe by October they'll have quite a bit of costumes available for Halloween. 
---
The workshop most south west in ash heap has a tower just waiting to be built around. Would love to see what people could do in the limited time 
---
Ha ha. That was hilarious story.
---
The guy was technically arranging a gamble.
---
Bwahah raider life welcome to the Wasteland kiddos
---
It might not matter much but I've seen people on the Reddit offering there building services, could have one of them build you a nice church, padre.
---
I'd be all for this idea. I don't mind sacrificing some Camp budget in order to be able to store a little more junk. Actually, not even junk - if I could have like a weapon trunk or an armour locker or both, I'd be a much happier camper!
---
We had someone join us on the server and went to the golf club and no respawn.
---
I have seen this new behaviour too.
---
You are three quarters of the way to creating a new Appalachian folk song with this. You just need a lengthy banjo solo somewhere in the narrative :D
---
yeah try taking the stairs, fat cunt
---
I have wondered the same thing but i think theyre some quest item
---
I’m 800 hrs and have not launched a nuke. I’m sure the majority of that is building Camps. 
---
That would be hilarious, can imagine a deathclaw with a bunny tail and a picnic basket 
---
The Easter deathclaw lol
---
Sure, players use glitches to build CAMPs I locations other users can’t get to them, using that they can easily hold leadership forever on a given server. One of the methods shown, is building inside hollow houses with help of rugs and chairs.
---
Really liking the industrial look! I'd love a few more 'set piece' items for building. Just general crap, like railway cars or piles of junk or... I don't know, things you might find in a rail yard, just to add a little detail.
---
Great build! :D
---
Yeah that's what I meant by in the informational. We saw physical changes in vault boy representing in game ones in both instances.
---
Yes, yes, yes again! I try to blend camps in with the environment as much as possible and I would love some 'junk' or flavour items just to place around the camp. Those junk walls and that gate would be a fantastic start :)
---
These fellows offer building services, unsure of on what system

They could build you that church you've always dreamed of.
---
It snows in Toxic Valley already 
---
Maybe they already are on the inside....
---
This happens to me too, it's really annoying. I tend to turn the game off. Next day when I play again, it often works.

I would be happy with being able to get any loot without waiting 7 minutes for her inventory to show.
---
But yes, I do love this idea because there is a serious lack of nukage going on right now. 
---
Right here!🙋🏽‍♀️ I’m level 56 I used to play with my boyfriend but he doesn’t play anymore lol so I’m solo! I’m timezone is PST. (: my tag is Waallfloweerr 
---
&gt;But why is it so wrong wanting to support it?
---
Because you already supported it in full... you paid the price to play and what they are releasing now, should have been in the game from the start. So you want to reward them for fucking us up the ass and then even give them more money for it, even though you already paid for it?
---
Thats why this shit works...
---
The blood splatter may be tied to the weapon instead of the thing you're hitting, still weirdly fun though 👍
---
That would be a cooler explanation of some of the cryptids as opposed to just 25 years of radiation. 
---
Should be a firm rule across the board with drops that if your enemy has 3 stars, your drop should be too. Doesnt  matter what you get, as long as its 3 stars. 
---
Someone mentioned needing floors for AI pathing, so ok we need floors, but do they have to be perfectly square? Can there not be "uneven" dirt floors? Or stone, perhaps? 
---
On the flip side, more regular housing walls would be nice, too. Make the buildings look more like what's already in towns and such.
---
Omg yes!
---
I think the daily been fix since the Fasch event was removed.
---
An Easter deathclaw egg hunt event. Nice!
---
Yeah its sad even when it was Guaranteed 3 legend max lvl loot and recipe/plans the legendaries were always garbage for me but not it just trash 1 stars..... Bethesda sure knows how to make players quit end game.
---
Stew.
---
Yeah XD, been there. Had 3 attack my base along with all their scorched minions and they left my base in shambles. 
---
I feel the wild 3 stars usually drop 3 stars, if its an event one Bethesda nerfed them and they mostly drop 1 stars now.
---
“Pow......Pow......   ........ Pow pow...”

Dammit where the hell is he?!

the new “confetti on the floor” Fasnacht item could function a lot like debris on floor and variants too.

And yes more shapes for everything would be great... but for now there are these excellent moments when objects, walls, floors, snap or blend into the environment creating an entirely new design you never would have started with

Exactly! Remove friendly fire from vats, It’s annoying when someone tries to help you out clearing mobs then suddenly you accidentally shoot them.

I have about 20% budget left to detail it out but I can’t hold my breath for a railcar in the atom shop :p Thanks much!

It's the best when she just vanishes, just like the 3,000 .50 Cal rounds I burned before she dropped dead. Be right by her body when she dies, you can usually grab your loot pretty quickly.

I obviously don't agree with BSG releasing an "early access" game like they did. But i love the game in it's current state, put in a lot of time; nearly 400 hours and gotten a lot of bang-for-my-bucks.   
---
But I really appreciate the atom shop for what it is:  
---
\- I get a lot of free atoms by playing, and with each update more from extra challenges

\- There is no p2w items in the shop

\- There is no loot crates or lottery over what item I'm buying

\- They have recently started with a lot of sales and very good bundles  
---
\- Some of  the newer items is released with reduced prices already (f.ex. deathclaw statue vs power armor statue price)  
---
There are so many publishers going way worse then BGS, with their shops. Maybe if I actually start using money then I can get another perspective on it though. 
---
Snapping walls to roofs and foundations with lots of frustration! 
---
Role playing in this game just seems odd to me. I had been partying with all these 'other players' just the other day and now they are all automatically hostile and will kill me at the first opportunity.
---
My conclusion. Vault 76 was populated not by the best and brightest, but by a group of murderous psychopaths who were chemically subdued while within the vault, but have now been set loose on an unsuspecting wasteland.
---
Any other stars on it?
---
If you're on Xbox I'll give you one for free.
---
How I have yet to do the enclave quests
---
Ahh ok thats a shame ill try again tomorrow, thanks for the help
---
No worries, pal! If you ever need anything, feel free to hit me up. 
---
Survival got it's name wrong, it's deathmatch actually.
---
How much did you sell for?
---
Looking forward to having a store near flatwoods with loads of plans and recipes available at 10 caps each. Have never thrown a plan or recipe away since launch.
---
Art imitating reality.

The mark of a truly moral person is to uphold ones morals in the times that they are of detriment to oneself.

This post needs to be wildly upvoted - Bethesda should see this. You’re 100% right about the incentive, mate. They’ve gotta do something different for the SBQ or people will stop nuking altogether. My last two times I got 1* pieces of armour off of her, one of them was level 35. I wasted 2500 .50 cal rounds for junk I couldn’t use. Killed two or three other legendaries that spawned around her and couldn’t even find their corpses to loot. It’s maddening. 
---
2 Drink Minimum. 
---
I'll always upvote any sensible idea when it comes to more stash space!    
---
Just to be able to keep one of each types of power armor and a nicely stocked weapons armory without having no more room for junk would be great.
---
If I could I would give you gold.
---
This is extremely true and exactly as I see it and would like to see as the direction Fallout 76 will take.
---
How do they intend to add a raider themed vendor I wonder? Will they trash as existing storefront and decorate it as such? Interesting...
---
Not sure I'll play survival until I can get my animated gingerbread backpack and galaxy melee pickaxe.
---
I have one I believe, 3* 40% power attack and +1strength
---
I'll remember this next time I'm fighting the queues in the super market :)
---
Vault Tec just wanted to watch the world burn 😂
---
Particularly Violent People
---
There's one in whitesprings also
---
I hope this means player vending can be setup in Whitesprings.
---
Wait, does that mean they are out there watching us from somewhere? 
---
Yes, and if you heal another player that players damage should be added to both scores. Team work should be most rewarded.
---
Yeah
---
All the quests that give you a weapon in the end is scaling with your lvl, just make a alt, lvl it up to 50 and do the quests for the wepons, and get help from a friend to transfer them onto your main
---
If you read the vault entries, that's true. There was one pyscho who had to be left in his room at all times basically. The Overseer was able to lock people in their rooms in case they turned violent
---
It was fun until some guy with a glitched base killed everyone lol
---
I didn’t know I wanted this. Thank you
---
Fuel is mad expensive, yay my corpse is worth something!

Have a 3* db shotty tse

---
Then you can get one from me.
---
I’ll give you 800 caps for it if you’re just gonna vendor it. U on XB1?
---
survival mode is to see how long you survive so it’s most definitely supposed to be time, i politely disagree.
---
I have looked all over the prison multiple times and can not find them.  Did you have any luck?  If so do you remember where you found them?
---
Yeah I realize that. I just thought I scaled by 5 points not 20. So I would have gotten a level 20 but I got a level 15.
---
Where are the brotherhood/Enclave roleplayers to provide security to other players in survival? Seems like a missed opportunity if you ask me.
---
Are you trying to sell that unyielding sentinel set?
---
No, im trying to get ideas on the different combos of armor sets like unyielding cavalier and assasin cavalier 
---
I’ll see what I’ve got when I get on tomorrow, definitely have some 3 star raider armor, not sure if it’s what you need tho
---
I actually find the third person view much easier to use. I find I'm more situationally aware and there's that handy little 'dot' crosshair. Most of my rifles have long scopes anyway, so I manage to avoid the issue completely :/
---
Someone said the other day they only like to play in first person - would that be the same for you? If so, I can imagine the chameleon effect is a bit of a pain.
---
This is great, if I ran into that in the world I’d think it was just another building. Really cool design!
---
They do suck, especially with more than one attacking. Maybe invest the next few perk points in Fireproof? That's supposed to negate a lot of their sonic attack.
---
Yeah but you recognize there’s no reward for staying alive that long right? It’s impossible to fix as there are locations where you can hike yourself in with foundations, such as the tunnels in the cranberry bog.
---
Professional courtesy in the wasteland
---
Wow! That was a decade ago lol. I remember finding it in the upstairs I think near the crafting stations that are below. it’s hard to see because it’s in a cell with crap and mattresses covering the ground. Again, it was like 130days ago and I am out of the country so I can’t log in to confirm 🤣🤓
---
I've dumped every note and Halo tape except treasure maps and mission tapes. 
---
Can I complain that I was killed after taking a workshop? Or that my 999 stims dropped in survival mode? Or that I lost caps in survival mode? Or that I was one shotted in my uktracite power armor by someone who wasn’t even wearing power armor?
---
My current findings are such: most probably if somebody says given weapon is trash they are wrong. Weapons have been changed recently and the greatest researchers of this game are still puzzled what is the extent of these changes.
---
I can guarantee you there were weapons that were useless on monday and that are very viable right now.
---
I have no idea if your weapon is actually any good, but its good enough that if I got my hands on it I'd be testing this against sentinel, cavalier and unyielding builds until I'd be able to give you my opinion and be sure it aint bullshit.
---
If you are interested on research based opinion and not "people been doing that for months so they must be right" nonsense, I am open both for being a target practice against the weapon, or to borrow it, perform the tests, compile a report and give it back to you with the weapon.
---
My gain from that would be yet another obsolete assumption being retested, and the knowledge is the main currency I deal with and my most prized possesion.
---
That's to stop suiciders spawning inside the cheese house from blowing up the robots before you can hit them and therefore removing masks from the event reward. You were messing up the event.
---
I have not gotten a single three star nor two star from the 17 three stars I've killed in my entire career
---
Yeah I’d probably killed over 5k legendaries before I had a TSE pipe rifle with 90% reduced weight to drop, this was after the duping tho so it was already inferior to the duped lever and handmades I’d bought 
---
Ill shoot tou a friend request today
---
Pics or it didn’t happen 😏
---
Nah, I love turning around at neckbreaking/nausea inducing speeds and end up targetting a neutral NPC while surrounded by pissed off charred ghouls.
---
Is what makes gun-fu special :P
---
Been back playing regularly since the booze patch.  Killed 5 or 6 3 stars and pulled a single 3-star bowie knife from them.  Others have been mostly 1 star, though I think maybe a 2 star armor piece snuck in there.
---
I've tested it while paired with a friend. I completely exited the Xbox. Powered off and rejoined. The glowing ghouls did not respawn. I could see all the dead ones and all I could pick up was glowing meat. After a while of running around, some started to respawn which is why I feel it's tied to a time limit and not actually new people. 
---
I am vats heavy gun build. My build makes previous meta obsolete and irrelevant. There's already new meta that makes me irrelevant. Its really hard to say whats good and bad now becaude we only have three days of gathering data, and all the information gathered before the release of survival could be made obsolete with the recent changes and has to be retested.
---
I farm only plastic if I have to sell something or craft ammo for my shotgun and rarelly ballistic fiber. For the rest, I swim in materials
---
I agree that spawn camping and all the bugs beed to be fixed but you dont really have a right to complain about showing up in survival then getting slaughtered as low levels
---
Make sure to save some rifle ammo or heavy ammo for scorchbeasts down the road, but cool teamwork
---
No. It is just a plain old two shot submachine gun.
---
Companions would be awesome. Can’t even think about Fallout 4 without thinking about Cait, by my side for hundreds of hours and always there to pick a lock, chat or get me out of a tough fight. Companions in 76 would be awesome. 
---
Yeah the last 3 times I’ve fought her everyone that was at the fight got booted (XB1). The servers were actually pretty good before the patch that brought the parade, really hoping they fix it soon.
---
I carry 2, both legendary handmades with different effects. They cover 90% of my needs. I also have a leg 50 cal for nuke zones, but leave that at home.
---
In Survival I also take a leg anti armor recon rifle, useful for tracking players.
---
Yeah it is fun when you are the 40level killing 200levels. But when you are level 200 that gets 80caps on kill and lose 400caps on death, it is really not fun. Also when i look on that gameplay. Hidding like bitch and shooting people that don't even know where you are, don't look like fun. I did it too, because i needed some caps for fast traveling and once you go rambo pvpin which is fun, you end up dead no matter how good you are.
---
Just my two cents i did pvp back when the game first came out and now one had any good legendaries, for context it was lvl 50 vs lvl 40 both using guns we both shot at each other using stimpacks for at least 5 minutes trading bullets until i ran out of stims. Its literally a slug fest and a waste of ammo you shouldnt need to burn throught that many and for reference we werent spamming them we just popped them when we got low its not fun and a waste of recourses i much prefer dying to 1-3 shots on average rather than 10-50 bullets its silly
---
I know, that wasnt the part I was complaining about, it was when we went to our high level characters. and still got one shotted and spawn killed by everyone we came across. Even a player 60 levels below me still one shot me while I was in full power armor.
---
ok
---
Thank God for the whitespring bots near my base, adds a little extra firepower
---
Thanks. I will keep that in mind.
---
"The dragon has three heads"
---
Or assaultron..
---
Yes! This!
---
The staircase that is "RESERVED"!
---
I had stored all walls connected to the staircase and all the second floor tiles and I still couldn't move the effing stairs. I had to place the camp at the same place and start over. Several times.
---
What effects do the handmade rifles have.
---
As pvp lover, I was super excited for this mode, but being marked on the map is a definite no for me.  And losing caps upon death?  This discourages pvp.  We should be able to store caps like we can items. That way, anything you lose in pvp is totally on you.
---
Id consider revising your build then as most peoples builds that ive seen especially the average players build is terrible for pvp, not only that usually pa is quite bad for pvp compared to regular armour for a couple reasons: your weaker to exposive ranged weapons and just make alot of noise draw alot attention to yourself snipers love that. Not to say pa cant be viable but you cant just chuck on pa and expect to be tanky in pvp as players have many ways to reduce armour to bascially 0
---
You can make inner walls with the brick set. Just make every wall a doorframe and then place another wall at the same spot but turned the other way. Then you can use the store-replace function to make the doorframe into a whole wall.
---
2, bloodied faster fire rate handmade and bloodied explosive guass rifle
---
Interesting, so why i end up on same survival server when i was server hopping for 30minutes? 
---
I was lucky enough to find the ski sword plans. I don't remember where, but it was around the top of the world
---
One is an instigating.. so with my perks one shots everything under level 60, and takes 50% or more off the dmg bar for anything over 60 usually.
---
The other is a troubleshooter (30% on robots for clearing out silos) with explosive effect (I have 5 points in demolitions) for mopping up whatever is left over. 
---
The second one is technically more powerful by about 20 dmg, but a sneak attack with instigating really makes a difference with the former. 
---
I thought the security report said he was just some drunk guy? Post reclamation 
---
I carry 6. An AAE handmade, AA Buzzblade, AA supersledge, BE lever, Bloodied fire axe, and a bloodied buzzblade. 
---
You can come vent about whatever you feel the need to!
---
Yes it is WAY too LOUD! 
---
Thanks, was looking for a way to make more money. Water purifiers, here I go.
---
Grafton steel has lead steel and copper
---
I was lucky enough to find the shishkebab plans in a safe on the roofs of Watoga. The safe was in an area that had heaps of chairs with small tent roofs over them and there was also what looked like a hole for a pool. When I found the plans I was like: "Oh god, I am one lucky guy".  
---
Thanks.
---
I'm dropping one Saturday
---
Yeah I about that many. But they are more varied in weapon type.
---
Handmade, sniper and combat knife.
---
Just have your quests mostly take place at your own CAMP, or a friends. Or ten friends. The production value is your call!
---
What you need is a hireling. The price is 200 caps and I’ll follow you silently whenever you send a team invite (on ps4)
---
Thats a pretty good mix
---
There's 3 terminals in the vault, the overseer's talks about having to keep some individuals in their rooms, one in particular has to be locked down on the regular
---
My second queen fight, that I was actually able to help with cause I finished my build, I got disconnected when it actually died and the event completed :(
---
I was lucky enough to find the war drum plans on the wooden part of a bed in Pleasant Valley Cabins a little bit north of top of the world. You can also find the war drums themselves on the top floor of the top of the world building (there's usually two of them there).
---
There's nothing quite as deflating as burning a bunch of aid and ammo to take her down to get a 1★ board or lead pipe.
---
Unlike all these guys with legendary stuff for min maxing
---
I just carry 1 melle, 1 sniper, 1 full auto, 1 shotgun but I've started leaving the shotgun at home since I got plenty of ammo for the full auto and a lot of damage on the melle
---
Yep, one stab and he's dead, usually drops a crap weapon and piece of armor. 
---
No. Early access games are the new normal. Sorry that you are stuck in the past, but this is how it is now. I would rather help incubate a game with potential than see a bunch of "full release" abortions that could have been great games if they had more time while the AAA publishers spend billions to release CoD 8: The Coddening.
---
&gt;nearly 400 hours and gotten a lot of bang-for-my-bucks.
---
You had the same with Fallout 4 (which is basically Fallout 76 just better and without coop and griefers) for the base price and maybe the season pass if at all. So why would it be justifiable to spend more on this game, even though overall it delivers a lot less and is way buggier than Fallout 4?
---
Thats the point, you can do with your money whatever you want, but i just dont get this feeling of wanting to "support" a developer for fucking up and delivering less than they should have for the original price...
---
An instigating lever action for exploring and an auto handmade for killing big bois like scorchbeasts :)
---
Rifleman carries three, the gauss, handmade and Tesla. My heavy gunner with bear arms carries at least one of everything. Maybe 12 to 15 total.
---
It's not a lot, but sometimes if you've sold all the crap you just need something to wring the last 80 caps or so out of a vendor.
---
Yeah I carry a 10mm for ghouls and scorched, a heavy puncturing sledge and 2 black powder pistols for anything strong, somerset special as a vats“sniper” and a handmade for super mutant swarms.
---
Ever since release I’ve been hoping for something “shootable” in CAMP. Maybe something that’s shootable without the bounty. 
---
With the balloons, I had the idea of a shooting range/walkthrough/how many balloons can you pop and thus the wanted amount becomes the score sheet. 
---
We are in some rough times  
---
Weird thing though....a couple of mins prior to crashing my Gatling broke so I switched over to my shotty and perked it up.  Maybe a min or so later the server crashed and I respawed to a different server but my Gatling wasn’t broke.  Almost like the server was so bad it didn’t even catch up to my actual state
---
I can’t wait until I get my hands on an instigating or AA lever action.
---
Clever never thought about using photo mode to look around corners
---
A shotgun, a lever action rifle, a Gatling gun, a sniper, and a melee weapon
---
I use the knife the most, it's bloodied. In sneak I can walk right up to most things and kill really quick before they alarm the other npc.
---
Two melee, two guns, and a heavy weapon. 
---
I agree with you for the most part. The challenges are getting harder but I assumed it was to create new challenges for super high level players (I’m 58). The atoms are overpriced tho so, putting aside the evils of micro transactions, they really aren’t worth it especially with so few items in the shop. 
---
At this time, I have no intention of buying atoms. 
---
But, the DLC is free, and if you’ve played 400 hours and still want to keep playing, another $5 here or there is not a big deal. You don’t have to feel shame for wanting to jazz up your camp.
---
What is the gatling gun good for?
---
If you think the handmade rifle plans spawn at the watoga station vendor only between levels 15-44, you are terribly mistaken. I found the handmade rifle plans at the watoga station vendor at level ≈120 for around 2000 caps and so did my level 100 friend. Also, I think that the handmade rifle plans will still spawn at the watoga vendor for you even if someone's already bought them. 
---
Oh thats actually pretty good.
---
And like clockwork the rogue Dev downvotes to try to minimize exposure. I will not be silenced! Let freedom ring and my servers be stable!! That’s is all
---
Ohh yes, even better! 
---
What are heavy weapons useful for. Boss fights?
---
They are unfortunately hard coded
---
So you want to stop bullying by.... bullying.
---
People keep asking for a social hub. Looks like Whitespring is going to be it. 
---
Yes, on ps4 too
---
Message me with a price and a gamer tag
---
I was once doing the uranium fever event and as a prize I got the combat shotgun plans. Even though having the plans is nice, it is much easier to just kill mole miners or scorched and then scrap the shotguns they drop
---
You don’t need explosive guns to absolutely demolish someone. What you need is to get 3 hits on target.
---
That would be neat
---
Changed my game totally. Can do the golf club while they're all still sleeping. Stabby, stabby 😊
---
I had the same thing happen with a bunch of Brahman today was walking along the road and about 10 of them just dropped dead
---
Stabby, stabby
---
When people play survival the way it was meant to be played, people are having fun.
---
When people are playing this mode as if it was overwatch or any random pvp focused game they'll start whining and complaining.
---
Good job OP, and i love it that you're not even using TSE weapons, chameleon/sentinel armor or fighting near train stations. Just more proof that any weapon can be great in the hands of a good player. You're proving that all those items aren't actually needed. 
---
I want junk walls. Why can't we have those?
---
I was doing the uranium fever event and as a prize I got the double barrelled shotgun plans (I also got the combat shotgun plans from doing uranium fever). Even though having the plans is nice, it is much easier to scrap the shotguns mole miners and scorched drop.
---
The moment I learned about time-alive leaderboars I instantly built a glitched camp with no external access. I didn't want to lock myself up in there for lame advantage, oh no, I already deconstructed that camp when it served its purpose.
---
It gave me information on how to penetrate impenetrable camps and that was the only thing I was after. I already managed to kill one of such inaccessible leaders.
---
Nuka grenade radiation goes through the foundations and floors, thats the "stationary way". The nonstationary requires two people. One of them stand on the target camp and simply stays above the locked leader, his role is to be a beacon, aiming guidance. The other player leave the server, rejoin it, and sprint to location marked by the friendly player. Before the camp finishes loading, you might find an opening and get yourself inside.
---
This is the first time i'm hearing so you might wanna check your end to see if everything is okay. Also, don't forget that there's a reason why consoles are cheaper because there are more problems
---
Also, just so you know, by saying "I also got the combat shotgun plans from doing uranium fever", I don't mean that I got two plans at once because that's impossible in fallout 76.
---
It still funny how I can take down a scotch east queen without using a single stimpack, but one guy crouching in a corner with a shotgun demolishes me. Just saying things need more balancing. I know my build is geared more towards pve than pvp, but at least give me a second to react to getting shot, rather than just instant death.
---
The only reason to do pvp server is for the weekly challenge and pvp. The caps system is off, being in the top 3 does nothing but show you on the map amd among other things. I agree power armor is only food for the extra carry weight in my opinion 
---
Are you guys still hiring?
---
Do Uranium Fever - it gives you like 20-30 gauntlets at a time and about 4-5 plans each time
---
Amazing!
---
I made a new character and got two bugged Discover challenges from 2/5 to 4/5. I might start a third one to see if Grafton Damn would finally register on that.
---
1 melee though I am a melee build. 1 shotgun and a lever action. All 3 star weapons. I would love to be a gun build but ammo takes to much to either collect, or make. 
---
It’s also great as being the only way to see leg armor. 
---
I found the lever action rifle plans at the Lewisburg station vendor and bought them for around 1900 caps. Damn it I was only 50 caps off though and had to do server hopping to get he rest of the caps from mole miners
---
Around a dozen sometimes more depending on my stash weight. 
---
This is an awesome idea....i have to admit...id wana find a dupped tse just so i could try and fight the monster
---
Yeah against ammo sponges I just shoot them once with each of my black powder pistols and then go in for the melee.
---
Do you think the crashes occur more or less since patch 7?  After patch 6 I was really impressed with the cut down on lag and disconnects, but a good deal of the instability seems to have returned with patch 7.
---
Why?
---
Just because you don't find it fun to sneak around it doesn't mean that nobody finds it fun.
---
Maybe for you being a rambo is fun but i think it's pretty stupid. 
---
Everyone can stay in the middle of a street and use a minigun, not everyone can use cover effectively, not everyone is able to encircle an opponent and find another angle of attack, not everyone knows how to pay attention to the sounds other people make.
---
It takes way less effort to be a rambo than to sneak around effectively.
---
I'd recommend you to watch some of the videos frankieonpcin1080p posted on Arma 2 because it's literally the same shit fallout 76 survival mode is. 
---
The turrets and lamps have been greatly reduced lately. If it is still a problem to you, you will need to rethink your Camp.
---
As long as I can become legendary for a short time and grow to the size of Dinky via a syringer growth serum, I support this. It's totally not part of a Jurassic park themed camp for dueling idea I've been mulling about.
---
I’ve had other players in game tell me the same thing, not sure what to do tho I’ve cleared my cache I’m running’s wired connection on 1gb fiber internet on a brand new XB1 X. But if you have some tips I’d be happy to check it out, definitely part of why I made this post besides mailing out on that 3 star legendary because the Vault Tec garden gnome was added, yay!
---
Don't forget hectic nuke zones. But yeah with out any legendary effects or mods similar to those effects PA will always be worthless in PvP you would have a better chance nekked because at least your hitbox is smaller and you can hide in the foilage.
---
So it looks like there's at least 3 variations of rewards, turning in 1, 2, or 3+ right?
---
I've seen people doing the Patrol Duty Quest and receiving the crossbow plans as a reward (even though they were farming for the handmade plans - handmade plans also have a chance of being the quest reward). But I don't understand - why would you do an exotic weapon build especially with something as bad as the crossbow? the weapon itself does little damage and the crossbow bolts take heaps of materials to make and are very scarce to find. 
---
They should move that kind of events to weekly and increase atoms for it. I'll not créate a new alt just only for 10 atoms
---
Melee i use for when I'm alone ie whitspeings,westtek. I did have the 4 barrel dragon but it took to long to reload. Black powder though is nice. I just wish it reloaded faster.
---
Stories from the wasteland. 10/10, I would read it again.
---
I read that one shotting dmg was supposed to be reduced..
---

---

---
 Text chat is a necessity.
---
Yeah you can get a faster reload legendary effect and a perk that gives it a chance to auto reload.
---
Why do you need the super sledge plans when you can take them from any super mutant you kill? Besides, you only learn one new mod when scrapping them (it's heating coil which adds energy damage)
---
I'm on Xbox and if you want to test this with me let me know.
---
A sniper/ long range rifle, a shotgun or an automatic, a pistol/revolver and one melee weapon.
---
Completely wrong. You've had another 200 levels to learn your character, adjust specs and horde gear. If someone is beaten by a level 80 and they're 280, they deserve the penalty. There's simply no changing my mind.  
---
Many people at that level just glitch exploited themselves to gain tons of unearned levels and survival mode is just putting them back in their place as they've been getting crushed in real PVP. 
---
I carry at least 2-3 rifle weapons I switch between plus 2 handguns and several explosive grenade types. 
---
Yeah, I read that too. Didnt reduce it enough I guess.
---
Are you from the past?
---
I probably worded things very badly in my first post, english isn't my native language. I think the server has a up-time window of 5 to 10 hours before it stops sending people to the server and wanting to shut down. 
---
PC unfortunatly, I'll test when a friend comes on and report back.
---
These two plans are very easy to find: The Gauss rifle plans are in the whitespring bunker in the MODUS vendor computers (for about 2000 caps) and the radium rifle plans are always at the watoga station vendor
---
I think it's ~3 days. I had a "run" I would do and after about a 1-2 days of trying I didn't see any more TD till about the 3 day. I turned about 40-50 TD withing the first 1-2 days.
---
I found a nonlegendary bone club once, havent seen it before nor after

Gatorclaws were made post war, their creator Darren McDermot had become a ghoul and used a replicator to make himself food to survive he did this for about two hundred years. He later on an expedition to the surface found a dead super mutant and used its DNA and brain cells (which contained FEV) combined with DNA from Jackson's chameleons and alligators in an attempt to create a guardian to protect the safari adventure park and himself from raiders. the Gatorclaws however were not obedient and quite dangerous he was mortally wounded by one and was later found by Cito. McDermot tried to explain to Cito how to turn off the replicator which was continuously cloning more Gatorclaws and how he had created them then died from his wounds. Cito being quite illiterate because he was literally raised by ghoulrillas was as handy as a non functioning Mr.handy and had no idea what the fuck the replicator even was. This is when the player shows up and presumably shuts that fucker down at least the Gatorclaws aren't all named Gary.

Deathclaws however were made prewar by splicing a ton of "mixed animal stock" (idk that's what the wiki called it) together primarily Jackson's chameleon so they could be used for the war. Not much is known about the prewar deathclaws. Current deathclaws were created when The Master a man who took PC building to the next level used further genetic manipulation and FEV on the deathclaws creating the current day deathclaws.
---
there was a second form of Deathclaw in fallout 2 created when the enclave subjected them to a different strain of FEV and tried to make them obedient. These Intelligent Deathclaws questioned the Enclaves motives but helped them capture the residents of vault 13 (the vault you start in in fallout 1) they later abandoned the enclave and took residence inside vault 13. they were mostly wiped out by the enclave using Frank Horrigan a prewar secret service agent that came in contact with FEV became a super mutant and was bonded to a suit of power armor that kept him alive.
---
TLDR:Gatorclaws are not prewar. Deathclaws were prewar but not as we know them. FEV can make anything possible and the lore is really wacky.
---
Do the event one violet night
---
I’ve had this happen multiple times the past two weeks. The 6 weeks before, maybe 1 or 2 the whole time. 
---
Thanks, I read 20 - 24 hours, but my experience is the same as yours, I went back daily and only on day 3 did the desks start to fill again. 
---
The cabins on the left if the golf course is at your back 
---
We need lead for our automatic weapons. And their ammo is actually dropped only on rare occasions.
---
I appreciate you giving your input and experience but this is a known issue and I’m trying to give it a little more exposure so maybe they’ll address it in the next patch. I’m glad it hasn’t affected you but the answer isn’t always on the host side, it definitely has something to do with the servers imo. You gotta admit the servers have been pretty shit since patch 7 at least compared to how they were for like a month before and this seems to be a symptom of that in a way.
---
Yup..it is possible to speed run it and avoid fights
---
Just built my new camp in walking distance of whitesprings so I could not be happier!
---
Strongly agree. Free for all death match is usually ranked on K/D
---
I haven't looked at the challenges for like a week. Because I can't fucking see straight from all this alcohol consumption! It didn't help that I was a light-weight coming out of the vault. That was one helluva dry spell. Wait...did you see that? I think I spotted a scorchbeast there yonder - hold my beer, my wine, my case of ... nukashine.
---
if it dies for any reason do i have to tame another one or will it respawn when i use the repair all function of the camp? 
---
I did once, passed out at Watoga for a minute or two in the trading window. Woke to a guy laughing and trying to wake me up. It was funny. 
---
I have only gotten a few of the outfits and only once each and accidentally scrapped them due to the history of never being able to use "scrap all items" as that includes bulk and else...
---
I really miss my bomber jacket!
---
In 2004 we were playing operation flashpoint (which is now known as arma) on local lanparties. You better not campt there, or someone would slap you. I am pointing out, that camping is too cheap to be fun, especialy if you are thirdparting some fight from distance. If there were hit marks to show direction and you wont die in 1 or 2 shots, it would be cool. 
---
Ofcourse if you enjoy frustrating 3guys whose trying to atleast find you, have fun &lt;3 
---
I carry one TS fire rate handmade and instigating explosive lever… and one instigating death tambo for… punch.. things… and people :3
---
A fellow Responder!
---
If you're on PS4 I'm more than happy to team up, I've been trying to slowly build up a faction of people with a lawful neutral kind of manner while helping the new survival arrivals as best we can.
---
"This is the quest that never ends.  
---
Yes it goes on and on my friend.  
---
Some people started doing it,  
---
Not knowing what theyd get  
---
But people keep on doing it forever just like jet."
---
I agree. Especially when more late game content is released. Imagine killing a 4 ot 5 star end vault boss, and get only a one star pistol drop....
---
Fuck that. 
---
Lol dam everyone downvoting could at least offer some solutions if you think it’s on me, bleep bleep bloop im a mindless robot who downvotes things that don’t happen to me because I don’t think they exist. 
---
You the one downvoting bro? 
---
Yes on xb1 too a lot 
---
I seen many plans at the watoga station vendor - radium, power fist, handmade, ultracite laser gun, assaultron blade, broadsider, crossbow, cryolator, cultist dagger, cultist blade, death tambo, flamer, harpoon gun, ski sword - the railway rifle is also in the plans list. But why would youdo a railway rifle build? It does crappy damage, weighs a lot, ammo weighs a lot, has hardly any modifications and gets no sneak attack crits
---
PSA: Bloodied is stronger than TSE  in pos-tse nerf and with fireproof+dense
---
Oh! Per session? I will try that out!
---
I second this please 
---
Hiding behind a downvote classic 
---
Ya same I know when shoo is updated lol
---
Dont forget switching to adventure mode to fast travel where you want then loading in to survival. 
---
Same happened to me with a shotgun
---
The weapons are lighter when I carry them and more heavy when in my stash
---
So you just don't complete the challenges and move on with your life. I'm sorry that you are such a failure at everything that you do.
---
Eh no I wasn’t and it wasn’t the cheese house. It was literally every building in town. 
---
3 Weapons
---
1. Main PvE- Max Instigating Explosive pipe bolt, kills anything 1 shot, but slow rate of fire.
---
2. Faster PvE- Max Anti-armor, Explosive, Faster Crit Fill Lever. If my sneak is compromised or going against multiple shot targets like scorchbeasts/queens.
---
3. Low LVL Mobs- Instigating Combat knife, with anything up to LVL 15-20, kills in 1 hit. Save my ammo, easier to repair and fun to change playstyles every now and then.
---
This also happened to me last night
---
Nobody misses you.
---
Best is to have that white (red rocket?) paintjob. Then you are big marked target on open field. 
---
TSE will blow you up and every build have armor reduction perks, so you are basicaly naked. 
---
PA is no-go survival.
---
T51b power armor has the highest protection (ballistic and energy) in the game, being at around 500 ballistic, 500 energy and 500 radiation, while the other ones range ≈480-490 damage, energy and radiation resistance. 
---
Two, a black powder pistol and a sledgehammer. I call them "Crash and Burn".
---
I carry 5 weapons with me. A sledge hammer as my main weapon, a prime gatling plasma for SBs, granade launcher for groups of weak enemies that don't deserve the time to hammer them, daisycutter the mirv for groups of strong enemies that don't deserve the time to hammer them, and gauss riffle for pvp.
---
For a time I carried around the bunkerbuster to try to make it work. But couldn't find a niche for it that the other weapons don't already cover.
---
Lol ur such a hater dude 
---
Good idea. I dont bother trying to kill the sbq anymore because there just doesn't seem to be any interest from the rest of players.  
---
Once last night when we got her she had zero loot drop , and 2 other regular beasts also had no loot , the regular scorched did drop but not the beasts
---
you need to see a doctor
---
g2a is known for selling stolen keys or keys that were bought with stolen credit cards... and obviously publisher ban these keys.
---
For long time i had only Instagasting hunter rifle, and if i would be out of ammo, or that rifle broke, i was carrying 4\*machette.
---
With low level alt i was using whatever weapon and when it broke, i picked another from mobs i killed.
---
T51b has the highest damage, energy and radiation resistance out of any power armor at level 50 - around 500 proection for each type of damage. Don't be fooled that X01 is stronger - T51b is statistically the best power armor in Fallout 76
---
Downvoting stuff just because it hasn’t happened to you? That’s some hater ass shit right there and I find it pretty dispicable
---
Now human ... build Chürch for me!
---
you must be new to the internet
---
Thanks for the specific answers btw, “oh yeah it’s definitely on ur end cause no one has told me about it and I’m like an expert for sure, no bug gets past me no sir” HAT-ERRR
---
A whole new character just for about 30 atoms?
---
Ok thanks for letting me know 
---
Boy you make dumb ass posts I guess it’s all in the perspective cause I woulda downvoted every single one of your stupid threads. “duhhh was the bone club in the game before hand? I mean I know I could google it but I guess I’ll just post it on here for all my hater friends to circle jerk with me” gtfoh
---
All those downvotes. Technically i meant the normal game mode. The fact that everyone could see you all the time was annoying. 
---
Apologies for the difficulties. Please PM us through FB or Twitter and we'll be happy to look into it.
---

---
I think if you were teamed when he killed you, you probably already split the bounty. I seem to remember someone saying your team mates can kill you can you will automatically get half. (seems like a bug to me). So you probably double dipped on your bounty.
---
Think im at about 6 too. Tambo, power fist, that diamond ski sword thing, knuckles, a sniper, and a lever action. Sniper is mostly just for looking around but I guess binoculars weigh less. Luckily most of my melee stuff weighs next to nothing
---
PvP is, to a degree, optional.  
---
Thats the purpose of the "survival" mode.
---
Want to PvP, go there.  Want to be more like the FO we all know and love, use Adventure mode.
---
That said, in Adventure mode, players are open to PvP if they take control of a workshop (whch is not required to complete the game), and under certain other conditions, but PvP in Adventure mode is not mandatory/required to complete the game (joining a team to co-op may be).
---
The middle levels - 10 to about 30 - can be tedious, but, IMHO, there is not a lack of things to do to gain those levels.
---
I'm getting a crew together to run some "talon company" sessions. Group up in survival, find number 1, charge 500 caps for bodyguards for a half hour. each guard obviously. Watch the client loot with impunity while my trio of stealthed door watchers keep the scavenging site secure. 
---
I’m just a normal level 50 sneaky VATS players with normal non legendary gear and I agree with you. 
---
My VATS headshots will take down anyone in a few hits, no matter the level or gear. The only thing that will prevent that is a fully geared sentinel standing still or a cavalier running.
---
I didn’t want to be a murderous psychopath in survival, but with my low level, and the relative ease to kill higher levels, means it’s by far the best way to make caps. 
---
I don’t pay a attention to the challenges often but...I have noticed this i ageee they should make the challenges not alchohol related 
---
Thata actually a cool idea. I wouldn't have done the race, but pretty cool. 
---
30 atoms a day for 3 weeks. Personally I’m too lazy to do it and am grateful to have the disposable income to spend $5 here and there on the atom shop if I really want something. I understand for people who don’t or who are more frugal, though.
---
I’ve got three legendary weapons when I’m wandering the wastelands: a super sledge, a lever action rifle and a gauss rifle.
---
I’m a little curious as to why you thought OP was stalking you.
---
It gives you minus 4 strength. I assume if you didn’t even have 4 to begin with. The debuff would count towards any additional strength you attempt to gain. 
---
Why not enclave? 
---
Not 1 individual but some buddy recently blew up my camp what just happened before and I've seen it happen to other people and before the last batch I've seen so many people get killed by high levels and they were low levels and it happened for no reason whatsoever I want to teach these people a lesson and have fun doing it are you in? That's what this post is about
---
we really do need halloween outfits, mostly enemy inspired, would love to take photos with friends in ghoul costumes or with a deathclaw in the deathclaw costume
---
That's very true, in the start I was very frustrated and had the same opinion about spending money on the game. I even took a break for a month. But the current rate I don't have to spend money at all, because there is so much free atoms and so little items in the shop.   
---
And in Fallout 4's case, the DLC did cost money. But in 76 every DLC seems to be free, so far. 
---
How much damage does it do?
---

---
Everyone that was farming the crap out of white springs tossed a fit about how many people were getting TSE weapons and 3 star legendaries constantly so bethesda nerfed the damage and spawn rates, now people want it all back how it was ? Lol
---
Oh my lord, I never thought about how teeth grindingly frustrating Gun-Fu must be! You must have nerves of steel ;D
---
They’re dumb, yup, but how about just don’t do them? Like, really? Atom points? Need that princess bed that badly?
---
My build is crit commando with a 1* AA Handmade non with full health and its still pretty strong. In pvp it also annihilates.
---
Yet you still lurk on the sub. Kick rocks you little shit
---
I agree. It’s not anything like what a hardcore survival mode should be. 
---
Right now it can kinda be that if you ignore the leaderboards. But all the mechanics Bethesda implemented are geared toward making it sorta like a battle royale where players are always hunting down the top 3. 
---
Last night she slapped me so hard, I not only died but locked up in “Respawn In 1” for the remainder of the fight.  I could see the action, and worse, take damage, but could not move or shoot.  Couldn’t fast travel either because of the enemies about.  Finally, when everyone had finished cleaning up the area, I fast traveled just outside the nuke zone, went back in and watched the queen feather fall to the ground.  Collected my share of the loot and then went around picking flowers until it was time to start stabilizing it.  
---
:/ 
---
That's some real peek-a-boo right there.. Quality moth!
---
Hoo boy. Bear arms makes me feel like the weapon hoarder, everybody saying 2-3. I have 6 guns and 2 melee tagged as favorite. 
---
Tse gatling
---
.50 explosive exterminator 
---
.50 assassins explosive
---
.50 vampire 
---
Mutant slayers lmg (mutant slayer, limb damage and ADS movement)
---
Junkies gamma gun (pvp delete button) 
---
Anti-armor knuckles
---
Troubleshooters dcg with swing speed and reduced weight. 
---
Usually carrying 10k+ in ammo. 
---
I'm sorry you wrote this.
---
Yeah, I knew it before; was testing medic pump to see if it procs in PvP. It doesn't.
---
Has happened to me on multiple occasions as well. I think it's just an odd loading bug where someone's previous spawns from the area bug out and die. I'm guessing it's to keep load on the server down from having to render and perform AI for mobs when no one is in the area.
---
This is a must, I feel like I’m missing important information.
---
What? I'm confused and yea trying to start anti raider/resistance does this mean your group will collaborate?
---
Hire this guy
---
People play sober? 
---
When Survival came round, I resigned myself to losing the 5k+ caps I had. In hindsight, I should have blown it on a blueprint or recipe, but I never could have expected that explosive legendary users would annihilate even 45% fireproof in 2 hits. The ONLY reason I kill people these days is to get up close and personal and play Dark Souls roll-catching with them. (Jumping up and down against melee VATS = Roll dodging in DS).
---
Surpressor should help but I'm uncertain if even 50% effect does much. Usually too busy screaming at the hopper and VATS critting their ass.
---
Todd Howard is very proud of his font choices. There’s a Q&amp;A when this comes out, unfortunately. I wanted to hit him. Just this once. 
---
Maybe he considers which “text” is least to most important then consider legibility after that. 
---
Let’s hope the terminals contain the best stuff. 
---
In all seriousness this seems like a reasonable/sensible request 
---
Ya I see it a lot in watoga 
---
What the fuck does that mean
---
The thing is that this leaderboard map marker is absolutely great feature if you are part of PvP team looking for another PvP teams. Brilliant, when it works.
---
Also, the way it is organised still allows you to be safe. If you see you are approaching the leaderboards, you just have to perform a controlled suicide somewhere where you'll regain your bag safely.
---
Having the top3 displayed on the map gives you one more tactical advantage if you are there for PvE. You know which areas will turn into battlefields, where the players will concentrate, and where to stay away from.
---
Don't hate it. Accept it, think it through, use it for your own advantage.
---
I suggested something similar...that pvp be suspended in a nuke zone.  These guys went nuts man.  Lol.  Dont try to take away their ability to get cheap kills whatever you do.  This makes you a care bear apparently.  I've played a lot of pvp.  This is by far the worst system I've seen. 
---
they're doing it to encourage people to try out the new content they added. it will probably have more variety as wild Appalachia continues. its really not that big of a deal.
---
You can see how long you can run...? 
---
A protection racket is a classic raider role play. You guys can white knight and go after station campers and other shitheads, talon company would be the type to find #1 on a map and offer bodyguard services. We get to farm loot and caps off players gunning for #1, and #1 gets a measure of security. 
---
*talon company not responsible for repercussions of refusing contract* 
---
&gt;It should instead be based on amount of player kills. 
---
Maybe a combination of highest amount of kills with longest surviving. This way it will at least target the person most likely wanting to engage in a pvp manhunt.
---
It’s good for pvp I think 
---
Seems like 76 itself “adventure” is basically survival? You could implement no FT and whatever else. 
---
A lever action, and a semi-auto handmade primarily.
---
I also have two that I swap out as desired, a .50 sniper with tagging scope for survival, and a BP rifle (because it has 1046 base damage) that's my fun gun. 
---
Damn good stuff 
---
For me it work for Marsupial and Grounded and blocks Adrenal.
---
Umm no
---
Every MMO is a shitshow at release.  Maintaining these games costs money and considering how poorly it did immediately after release it’s not the worst idea to buy the occasional atom to keep the game going.  
---
Being marked on the map is my favorite feature of survival as it allows you to make educated decision wheter you want hard PvE or PvP encounters. Without it players would not be concentrating anywhere so less fun for PvPers, but instead were roaming the cool spots so less cool spots for PvE. So far I only met a single non-3*-legendary monsters so if you are after loot its pretty much only survival. Because of the map beacon, PvPers can get their action, and PvE spots are mostly empty, free for PvErs to take advantage from.
---
I had about 10 under lvl 15 legendaries...  Decent pieces I was holding onto to make an alt that never came about.  Find a pair of lvl 7 guys running around morgantown airport.  Fast travel to them.  Wave.  They wave back. Drop legendaries.  Wave some more.  shoot at bag.  they run off scared.  I say over mic 'don't run, i dropped goodies for you'.  No sign of them.
---
Yes but some players like myself didn't want anything like the arcade game they gave us.
---
 Right now I'm stuck between modes. 
---
They made adventure mode have absolutely no dangers.  The game is super simple with nothing I can't kill very easily. I used to be somewhat weary of other players even with the slap damage. Now there is absolutely no fear or worries. Kind of boring.
---
 Survival mode is a joke since you can hop back-and-forth between modes. Then I have to listen to all the arcade dinging noises when other people die.
---
 Don't even get me started on that God-awful stupid leader board.
---
 All I wanted was an Survival adventure mode with unrestricted PVP, no slap damage.  Players would have to start over and be locked to that mode. Therefore you can't level up on easy mode then transfer over to survival.
---
Mind you I do not actively seek out PvP nor do I really like to do it but I absolutely love the danger it brings.
---
 Just wishful thinking though everybody has their own ideas on would a perfect survival server should be.
---
Exact why I barely use vats unless I'm alone and fighting a small group of enemies or a single enemy. Honestly, I like the old vats better. The bullet time and ability to switch targets was a lot more useful. 
---
I'll put it this way have you ever seen a YouTube video of somebody being a bully and then getting the shit beat out of them? Same concept
---
The Two shot mod doubles rate at which your gun degrades 
---
So two wrongs make a right? Pretty cool concept!
---
Handmade 
---
Wouldn’t it double the rate in which luck of the draw hits then ? It’s a lot quicker than double thou. 
---
It's useful sometimes for events where you have to protect something. Target the protectee, crouch to avoid agro, and just fire at the bot anytime something gets near with an explosive weapon. The splash damage kills all the stupid wolves/moles/rats without all the effort.
---
It's my "afk" way to complete those events
---
It is fine the way it is. If you are getting camped it is your fault. Not letting yourself be camped is pretty simple. It is geared towards...survival. The mode as it has been designed is about surviving the longest. The method that you use to survive is on you. The mode is flexible enough to let you accomplish other things on the server while you are there. 
---
The issue is that people that can’t pvp their way out of a paper bag or cant strategize their way out of their driveway find it difficult. That does not mean that it needs to be changed or nerfed. 
---
It is optional
---
Find someone to repair a chainsaw to 200% with weapon artisan and farm whitesprings. it's only good for 2-3  levels  though.  Then it will need repaired again.
---
I thought you were talking to me! I did Mamas with a random level 10 last night too! But I’m at level 60, and I dropped about 20 plans. 
---
This is why the damage should also be doubled... Not nerfed 
---
Forest - normal spawn rate but still slightly tougher at night. Savage divide - double spawn rate. The Mire - Quadruple spawn rate. However, that scenario would require lower quality loot per monster and lower character experience gained per monster during the increased spawn times to maintain the current balance. Anything that adds more monsters everywhere would make me more happy. Those among us that want higher quality loot per kill would not like that one bit though.
---
Sounds very interesting to the point of I might actually want to be in this group that you are in can you inbox me your screen name? I would like to talk to you about joining up
---
They are at PAX East? 
---
And the two-shot doesnt double the damage, just adds 25% doesnt it? So should degrade only 25% faster not double
---
White springs sells all mentats and radaway recipes 
---
Drown me instead
---
Agreed I thin the TSE nerf was handled badly should have been removing explosive legendary mod from gaining benefits from the explosive perk card. Not only did they ruin all two shot mods they ruined all explosive weapons that were already the worst weapon type in the game 
---
I thinks so if your interested inbox me your screen name
---
Turn off the Jukebox upstairs and Biv is a lot clearer 
---
Ahhh! Yes! Thank you! Mine's bad. I have only 3 strengh.  That's why I do not get extra strengh.
---
Wow. So dense
---
Not old enough to craft beer but yes old enough to kill scorch beasts..? I’m real life too? 
---
Challenges should challenge you to do things you wouldn’t normally do. They occasional put in the “level up” challenge which is basically Atom for the taking. 
---
 [https://www.autohotkey.com/](https://www.autohotkey.com/)  is a good way to go: you can remap all your keys virtually with it
---
I am using this since day one, without issue.
---
I will be your wife, middle aged male pattern baldness with bad acne scars and an affinity for chems
---
First time?
---
It feels a lot quicker than double, usually I go they 1000 .308 bullets before it breaks now it’s like 250/300
---
I agree and that weapon and armor are never legendary (at least I’ve never seen one). I kill him before the fanfare music stops playing, which I always find kind of humorous. 
---
Haha fantastic! Not what I had in mind tho
---
The way level scaling works makes no sense. Wendigos cap out at level 42. So they can only drop level 40 or lower legendary items. Why? Why is it capped at a level below level cap. Why does it drop loot that can't roll to max level? Hello? Is this a design choice?
---
Also screws, acid and gear. They drop great scrap. 
---
Who cares. Leaderboards arent tied to rewards correct?
---
Yes I’ve been using that to disable the windows key.  
---
Would you mind posting the script that you have configured?
---
lol. Im on PC though. Guess I'll post it for 1k :-P
---
TSE lever action, recon sniper rifle, gauss rifle, sword of bastet, two shot combat shotgun, short barreled marksman rifle with a red dot, and an executioners dragon or fatman for dealing with players attacking me or my camp. Sometimes it varies to other weapons depending on the mission. Most of my weapon stash are legendaries tho. 
---
As it stands right now there isn't much bullying going on because slap damage has been removed.
---
 I fortunately have not ever had my camp attacked and it's in a pretty centralized place on the map.. 
---
 Also if I do see somebody trying to destroy my camp I can easily teleport there and destroy them within a matter of seconds.
---
 Good luck to you though on your mission.
---
They want to limit the old folks!!  It's killing me, too.  I have a focusing problem and that font is awful.

---
&gt; The issue is that people that can’t pvp their way out of a paper bag or player that cant strategize their way out of their driveway find it difficult. 
---
Your argument is that a level 20 player has equal ground to a level 160 player? That if they "appropriately strategize" they'll have zero conflict?
---
I would like to see even less carry weight. But I think bethesda knows they can’t do it because they created the junk loop that they want to keep us all in. 
---
You have a point about Adventure mode, I could just do that. But I REALLY like the feel of constant threat in survival. I love lurking around and listening to footsteps. And meeting someone and us both trying to figure out who is trustworthy, or if we should engage. 
---
Except that last sentence doesn’t really happen yet. Most people are just going at it deathmatch style, and that’s cool. I’m sure it will die down over time.
---
The players that are complaining about being made a target for having the longest lives are not complaining because they do not want a tense high stakes PvP encounter. They are complaining because they do not want an arbitrary PvP encounter. It is much more fun and immersive and tense when you organically come across other wastelanders. The whole top 3 thing takes away from that a bit too much for me. 
---
Nope because they nerfed luck of the draw after launch because too many people were using it to get around the constant repairing. Which they didn’t like because that was an intended game play mechanic. And when they reduced the damage that’s all they did they didn’t make the spread any better or the rate of gun degradation made two shot bottom of the barrel. Ever wonder why bloodied explosive is now the top requested mod combo it’s cause it does more damage than old TSE but without any of the downsides. Yet people still bitch about TSE one shot me please nerf. 
---
Clearly you don’t realize scale of EPIC that is Survival Mode. 
---
I’m around 9 years sober and 21 clean and none of it bothers me either. I don’t sit there thinking how good that beer would taste, I think how much it will help me kill these monsters, which isn’t something that mimics life and I can easily compartmentalize it. Even after all these years, I admit the thoughts creep in while out with people drinking, but the game never messes with me.  I am tired of these challenges though. 
---
Yeah might aswell, a lot of people have too many caps rn anyways and worst case it’ll be a good scrap weapon for the legendary vendor in May 
---
Thanks
---
I tried to examine them closely and my determination is that they are Satellite Triangulation Assemblies and perhaps we use them to home in on a Sheepsquatch?
---
Damn, might find an instigating one then or anti armour. Ty 
---
Player vending. Sumn like runescape has would be legit. Ws Player hub
---
I don't have a problem with it, you know already know where the dot "should be".
---
Plus, unless your out of range, while targeting something through your sight, when you see it's health bar appear, you're on target. Fire as soon as you see it, and you'll 100% make the shot.
---
With a Kill leaderboard people who want to engage in PvP will fight each others while the rest of the people can play normally but with high stakes. 
---
Plus as it stands now is basically impossible to play the game normally (doing quest, reading terminals, crafting) because you’ll never know when you’re going to get on the leaderboard. 
---
Plus the more kills someone do the more powerful he is, and so to offset that he cannot see where the other players are (besides the others in the leaderboard) while the other players can avoid him if they are not prepared. 
---
Surviving time is not even skill bases it’s just a basic rotation if you stat enough time on a server you’ll end up on the leaderboard eventually. 
---
It’s also open to a lot of exploits: like killing themselves to avoid getting on the leaderboard. 
---
im glad u can't do such a bindings on PS4
---
This is fascinating, I kind of rush the vault as I was too excited to settle down and concentrate on reading the terminals, time to make my first new character and spend more time soaking up the post party atmosphere.
---
Yours looks better.
---
Hello, you are me.
---
I’m sure there will be more game types eventually. Hardcore. Megahardcore. Etc 
---
 Anti armor explosive is bugged and doesn’t give you full damage as it should but is still great bloodied explosive is top tier even without a build centered around the bloodied affect. Instigating is great for hitting hard for PvE only useless in PvP
---
Well tell me your in game name and I’ll be sure to keep a look out for your posse..I mean I had about 14 kills this morning and they all screamed and begged me to stop..bwahaha
---
Though I agree that the amount of flagrant disconnects went down significantly after Patch 6, I really cannot comment on how that affected the nuke launches, specifically, as I only launched my first nuke 6 days ago. 
---
I have noticed, for sure, that server disconnects have indeed increased since patch 7. It seems between 6 and 7, it was really smooth running. 
---
Incidentally, I launched my 17th nuke a little while ago, and by the grace of God, I was not disconnected. And we managed to kill the SBQ in under 15 minutes! (Granted, I think she was glitched as she spent 90% of the time on the ground, versus the previous launch, where she spent 90% of the time aerial, and we failed). 
---
I know it’s a completely different discussion, but as an aside, I wonder if the success rate in killing the SBQ is really just an RNG versus actual player contribution. 
---
I’ll shut up now. I don’t want to open a too big a can of worms. ;)
---
Also certain defensive Perks seem to only work some times. For example Dodgy, Fireproof and Serendipity.
---
On top of Seneca rocks, theres ground pretty far below the top rocks, so you get stuck in what seems to be a cave.
---
been suggested several times, including by myself. Need it, especially if it is a hazmat suit reskin. 
---
And Wendigo teeth and PreWar money. Lest we forget that. ;)
---
The wood for boiling water makes perfect sense. You can’t boil water without fire and wood makes fire... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Nice idea. Wish I used a play station now. 
---
Well, OP isn't camping. He's not going after the easy kills...
---
Way more than I need :)
---
@L49, No less than 7 to cover most any circumstance or critter, and that so far, I havent found a single weapon that works in all situations or against all critters.
---
I'm melee build, but not all melee weapons are usable when in PA.
---
So I have nuke zone/PA and non-nuke/out of PA melee weapons.
---
Plus sniper rifle, combat rifle, and a shotgun.
---
That guy wandered up on me the first time I was ever exploring a nuked zone. I turned around and All Rised him in the face (Chassis?) because he startled me so bad.
---
The answer to this after the last patch is always yes. Especially if I've just done something like claim a workshop.  
---
Lol, It's an online game every wife is
---
&gt;middle aged male pattern baldness with bad acne scars and an affinity for chems
---
Hazmat would be awesome. 
---
I'd also love to be able to put an ugly Christmas sweater on it when Christmas comes along. 
---
And yet TSE is the one with bad reputation... which was my point :D
---
Where does the container come from? And campfires are always "on" so they wouldn't need fuel
---
I think still bloodied explosive with vats lever and handmades...and bloodied swing speed melee
---
Had the same problem too. It doesn't seem to work.
---
I did play as a stealth commando quite some time, then at lvl 150ish switched to PA heavy gunner, as I found/traded very nice weapons and didn't want trade into cav/sent armor. I mean it's a blast in PVE, but at least some DR scaling would help... Well is what it is, not complaning, just observing.
---
The wood is used to fuel the distiller 
---
But that’s only a each day thing. Some daily challenges are annoying like killing enemies while intoxicated. 
---
Just fun to use lmao
---
Todd giveth and Todd taketh
---
The same reason you use wood to cook everything. Because Bethesda said so 
---
"I am here to preach the word of the mothman, GIVE ME ALL YOUR LAMPS!"
---
I don't have the build for heavy guns or the knowledge to make one atm, so I will gladly lend you the gun for testing. Heck, I'd love to hang around while you fire it at some dude in pvp armor! :-) My IGN is DangerMæn. I wont be much online today though. Im on CET timezone.
---
Don’t care much for PvP, MetA will change a lot 
---
Lmao. Yea ok. Anyone who already has a mule, doesn’t need this. Anyone who doesnt have a mule, doesnt need this. 
---
The wood is being burned in the crafting process to produce the heat necessary for the brewing system to work and for the water to be... boiled.
---
It's not being used to make the bottle.
---
Don't drink and nuke!
---
THIS NEEDS TO BE A THING HOMIE
---
Yeah I don’t care about pvp either that’s just what is meta now in PvE anything is viable if you try hard enough lol 
---
interesting indeed but my counter point is that players can simply farm it off each others friends 
---
I wwouldnt sweat it.
---
That 5 level difference probably wont matter - 
---
It wont be long before you start acquiring stuff that'll make that Somerset look like a bb gun.
---
There's not much to it, we had a soccer field with a ball we could kick around. There might only be two, but pretty sure I remember 3. You really should read all the entries, it shows how the vault had people from every walk of life and also explains how the vault dwellers would be predisposed to violence
---
I know Jug (Yt) has a few possible solutions. He’s active and very willing to help on his discord too
---
Guess you could say the server blacked out as well 
---
They’re hazing us
---
"Launch prep at 25... per..."
---
...Server not responding.
---
My asshole puckers every time now and I just hold that quantum bear tight and we sing "Ain't no Sunshine" together. We usually come out of that secret door smiling like a possum eating shit though.
---
Thanks, but I have to give credit where due, the idea and some design features definitely came from camps I have seen posted in Reddit groups. So shout-out to all who post their camps to give inspiration and ideas. 
---
Yeah but cbf repairing it every 200 shots 
---
or don't want your voice heard.   I agree entirely.
---
Glad I'm not the only one to see patch 7 was a step in the wrong direction stability wise.
---
I feel pretty much the same about how random queen fights seem to be.
---
The last one I killed was a level 58, so not sure where the level cap comes in. Got a legendary pipe wrench, chems, and teeth tho why you would want them I'll never know
---
Bloodied is too not so liked in comunity here :D I think it does not matter much, cause most weapons kills in 2 - 3hits so faster fire rate = better weapon. *I have instagasting hunting rifle and i do only little bit less damage than op.* Only fatman killed me on one hit. Bethesda actualy did some balancing. Also 19lvl kiled me with hadmade super easy.
---
I think they count as animals while the queen counts as scorched. 
---
*Belgium wishes to know your location*

Too late buddy, *burp*

But my 289 bobby pins are too heavy...

---
Check out r/falloutraiders I'm the mod over there, been building the raider role player community for about 3 months now. 
---
There's 2 subsets to raider mentality currently. 
---
Set 1: players from rust, or ark, where its a group repeatedly stomping a newb into the ground despite not gaining anything. When they're max caps, full stash, and duping god roll gear because they see no issue in cheating; "its what a raider would do" 
---
While that's very much in line with the cutthroats of Appalachia, it honestly gets boring. We've seen as toxicity levels ebb and flow with new game releases. 76 just got hit with a trifecta of fuckery. Released 6 weeks before Christmas, and was heavily discounted around Christmas, while receiving meme level hate trains. It attracted toxic personalities, that will probably end up leaving by the first anniversary. 
---
Subset 2 are the role players. They thought up/ wrote detailed back stories, they have a code they follow, whether it be only drinking whiskey or wanting to be a chem dealer, they've written up an actual character to play as, rather than just bringing toxic personality traits into online interactions. 
---
Before survival i did role play raids, like finding a guy at his camp and offering fire insurance. Don't buy the insurance, accidents might happen, this is a nice camp man, you wouldn't want anything to Happen to it. *cough* 50 caps *cough* or my other favorite, the Canadian raider that "wants your tims bud" (gimme coffee)  
---
These raiders are fighting the ever upward slog on getting Bethesda trained hoarders to share the game. Someone took a workshop? And I'm a raider? Damn Skippy I'm skull capping the owner. It's an online game, and you were warned at the claim bench. Random dude in the wasteland, adventure mode ill toss a wave and keep going, survival ill stalk and follow. 
---
yeah? Whats your reasoning?
---
What platform are you on? If you're on xbox I can have four power armor laden brotherhood knights help you out and give you some backup
---
Yeah they're presenting several panels today and tomorrow.   Fallout 76 is the first one and there is an Elder Scrolls anniversary panel as well.
---
Your a fucking douche
---
A bold choice... apparently. 
---
If you're on xbox I run a BoS style crew, we can help you out. We used to farm Glassed Caverns for the BoS armor before we acquired a bunch of legendary suits
---
Well I guess so cause I was all up in your mom like one bwahah no seriously though I rp a raider it’s part of the job
---
Players never been bullet sponges in FO76, unless wearing assassin+sentinel/cavalier armor.
---
Survival time based leaderboards are definitely here to stay.
---
I understand the premise behind the request and I dont disagree with validity of those concerns, but the way it is now is the best design decision that shows the Bethesda ability to understand the consequences of such decisions. Hear me out.
---
These are two valid concerns:
---
You can be glitch-camp-hidden, or casual level 20 exping, and you'll be given the leaderboards position you don't necessarily want even if you don't kill anybody. 
---
You can be the worst badass on the map, hoping to be hunted, and not be visible on map.
---
Right now as a player that is mostly interested in both PvP and the #1 position, there are only three people I am incentivised to kill: the podium. When I reach the #1 I am finally free to pursue my preferred playstyle: to be constantly under threat but not to be aggresive. I can get my action fighting people that try to hunt me down, instead of attacking people in hope they are worthy enemies and not people who'd prefer me to leave them alone.
---
My competetive approach and challenge addiction allow me to refrain from such lowly behaviour as to be spawn killing people, and I can still be the leader. If it were about kills, not killing everybody on sight would be a tactical hinderance.
---
Don't try to change survival into that direction because there are zero chances for success, and it could be idea I'd support if it were applied correctly. Instead of trying to make them change the core mechanics of the game they gave us, and make them pivot their project, voice your need for what you actually want.
---
Those people who'd like to have kill-based leaderboards not to hide away from it, but to occupy it, should organise their voice to get yet another game mode: manslaughter. Basically survival mode but with kill-based leaderboards to give these players recognition for being succesful in the playstyle they pursue.
---
Have you considered a perfectly complacent mule wife? 
---
Yea the whole your momma shit is for kids bruh please tell me your a preteen
---
I know right?!? One queen fight takes the full half hour and she doesn’t even get below half health after it regenerates. Then the next one, she’s dead in under 15 minutes?!?  
---
One thing I do like is that even if we fail the mission, she will often stay available so the players can continue the fight after the event fails. Eventually killing her (even if it’s 45 minutes in), so everyone can still get her dropped loot even if we all missed out on the event loot. 
---
Had it always been like that?
---
You’d think! 
---
Regardless of anything else, they're just boring.  The Division 2 has some interesting daily and weekly challenges.  Bethesda should look at introducing new challenges and game systems.
---
Why not implement a Bounty system on some special named mobs, they could be found in areas that are instanced to the player or group so they're not repeatedly farmed in the open world.  Introduce a new currency specifically for earning unique rewards legendary rewards at a vendor, pvp tokens and rewards, daily challenges that are different to the same old stuff.  
---
This isn't empirically confirmed to my knowledge but the early consensus was 3% of your health per strike 
---
Fast shooting with vamp will heal you and  the vats for people that don’t want to get staggered, but this is just my best guess as I dont pvp . But past experience from selling guns is that pvpers like vats 
---
So that was cringey.
---
Bring your friend and kill him over and over and over and over...  Players will exploit anything and everything.  Whatever they choose to do they need to think it through for more than 30 minutes and throwing it in the game.
---
It seems most people are happy about this but honestly do we need *another* reason for everyone to go there all the time? Almost every server I join half the people are at WS. Everyone else is low level at the forest or Charlestown. It’d be nice to have reasons to be somewhere else. 
---
See, I’ve never seen legendary items drop from a Wendigo nor have I even seen a Wendigo outside of Whitesprings (except a scorched one at Fissure Site Prime during Queen events). 
---
Foehammer, I assume this was from an event? Not just the random spawn at Whitesprings after killing a bunch of ghouls?
---
LOL'ed hard. Thank you!
---
The fast travel invincibility is only for when you travel to vault 76 and you must do so with your weapon holstered. 
---
Yeah, Survival needs a lot of work. 
---
Well, that's why it's in Beta.
---
b/c in the beginning, Wendigos are terrifying, so having Wendigo teeth is an ego thing.
---
After a while - teeth scrap to bone, and bone is needed to repair the deathclaw gauntlet.  (Dont know if you've ever used one - I have a 1\* DCG - base damage is 144.)
---
&gt;I think it does not matter much, cause most weapons kills in 2 - 3hits
---
Exactly! I really wish more people would notice that. These last few days the subreddit was flooded with people complaining about tse...While they can't even know for sure if it was a two-shot weapon or not. 
---
All weapons should receive the same amount of hate.
---
I think you should have done a certain minimum amount of dmg to the SQB or otherwise people would just tag it and will always get a guaranteed 3star item while others have done all the work, That would not be right either. 
---
Agreed. But we don't need a third mode. Just remove the pvp element entirely from Adventure mode and make Survival all out pvp. You die, you lose it all and get it back by seeking revenge. 
---
However, I think the rewards for playing Survival should be better. Maybe bigger farming rewards, better gear... whatever you can think of. 
---
The two play modes are already separated. If you don't want to take the risk, don't play Survival. 
---
Really? Was this written anywhere?
---
I disagree. This is perfect for people who want mules but don’t have them. Or move gear between two characters with different builds. Is there a better way? 
---
Woah there. He’s basically role playing a storage unit. Storage units don’t require much effort on your part. 
---
If your storage unit gets left behind in a radiated river, somehow, who know why. No harm done 
---
Well my stash is full of junk so I have to carry the vast amount of weapons I have, so I have 17+ lol
---
As you can guess I'm over-encumbered so have to walk everywhere, my weight fluctuates between 750-818 lol
---
I believe rifle gaming tested it. Or maybe it was igloo? I don’t remember some fallout youtuber tested it. Even so it’s only a few seconds most people don’t even load in fast enough anyways. 
---
and all traders have 1,400 caps shared so no more running around for it
---
Not working atm, and actually the point is about the game beeing delivered without it.   I mean it is not like it's a hard feature to implement/never been done before.
---
It has been like that since I started joining the event in late December, but I've heard others mention she used to fly off when the clock ran down.
---
A couple of weeks ago, we launched consecutive silos down there and all three times she was down between 5-8 minutes. Hopped servers and the next batch either wouldn't land or wouldn't take damage.   
---
Yes, but I don't like/want to use voice chat.  
---
Half the time I go to biv for a new recipe he won't give me one. The amount of time I have to log on, I'm lucky to get one a week.
---
It was during a blast zone. I fast traveled to the train station and started the usual loop to get to the country club building and when I finally got there I had a horde of like 15 glowing ghouls and the one wendigo, he was also glowing of course. I use a anti ghoul fire axe in these fights and it took a while to take down the mob alone but I focused on the wendigo first in case I ran out if chems and looted him as soon as he fell then focused my attention on the rest of the mob. My power armor has a jet pack so I can fly to the roof and get a breather as the mob runs away, then if you drop back down they all attack again. 
---
Agreed, it be nice to have more cards. Also I want deck load-outs. 
---
I heard from a few players one SBQ fight where she flew away about half way through the event and simply never came back. OUCH. 
---
Offline today too. I'm imprezobus and please add me because Im afraid I wont be able to use the æ on my PC.
---
I'm building an army now to do stuff like having two teams guard the perimeter of a nuke zone and deny the enterance there to other people, while the third team roams around inside and lures out all the 3* monsters to the perimeter collegues, powerfarming them in group. Or to have organised PvP fights where your opponents are your friends. Core is Polish but we'll be having international teams too.
---
We'll be training people and sharing the knowledge. I have shitloads to do and the international teams will get some love delayed when compared to our national ones, but they will be taken care of too.
---
I'm wondering if it's still broken? 
---
Thing is, text chat exists in 99.9999999 % of the online games without any issues.  
---
So there's always a way to do it nice, and this is the dev's job to think about.  
---
But you're right, if done, it has to be done right.
---
ofc why not.
---
I think it was meant to be for all fast travel spawns but probably a bug. Or maybe the timer starts right when the server receives the request to fast travel and not when you fully load in
---
Yeah definitely not working as intended that’s for sure 
---
Nope, those are your words.
---
Is more about having a strong gut :P
---
Fuck I didn't know that.
---
3 caps per item?! ANYWAY is better. a mule thats needed means there is usually 800 plus items needed to be moved. 2400 to move stuff? And what if this guy quits or isnt on....then what? Something more self sufficient is required. 2 xboxs is ideal. I know not everyone has 2 xboxs  but 3 caps per item. Gtfo. .5 cap per item at most no matter the limit
---
Triple Falls

---
Leaderboards are an important feature for some players. If it isn't for you, you definitely won't care about them.
---
The Leaderboards are fine... But I've really started to change my mind on the top 3 beacons.  I get the point:  you want to encourage player interaction.  But right now it encourages player hunting, which results in either "respawning manually" or hunkering down somewhere afraid to move.
---
I get the feeling this game mode is going for:  Tension and fear when encountering wastelanders.  Paranoia and apprehension alone in the wasteland.  Quickly hiding when you hear gunshots and frantically scanning the surroundings.  That's why I play survival mode! They've got some tuning on mechanics for sure but they have the feeling down.
---
Put the beacon on the top 2 Killers.  Makes them work a little harder for prey and might cut down on the "it is survival and I must kill!" mentality.  Makes things a little safer without compromising the tension.  And it serves as a rudimentary karma system. 
---
Would love love love to have access to some of the junky settlement assets at checkpoints and the super mutant town near Charleston. I think in general I'd love some floors, walls, and stairs that didn't snap on a square 100% of the time. A triangle foundation and a half-length wall would satisfy me for a full 40 hours of camp tinkering.
---
Attach it to the generator with wires/connectors needs 50⚡️
---
I never want to wear the beer hat again
---
Yes, that is my experience, too. Kinetic is quite useless and Medic Pump has this weird lag, which will basicaly get you killed in PvP. I think it's got to do smth with the whole "netcode" or however you want to call it - when playing FPS ADS, you gotta aim in front of running person in order to get those shots registered, while VATS are basicaly hitscan sure shots...
---
Accidentally hit the wrong button, kinda sleepy as I just got up, anyway my reply ended up as another post on this thread
---
&gt; Distance from it's FT target to vendor is about the same as WS ST to WS resot door
---
I don't think that's correct. If I go through the holed building, I'm standing before Wallace in less than 20 seconds and have to wait until his terrace and he himself slowly pop in.
---
One ghoul slayer handmade, full auto for the pesky hordes if I am too careless. One troubleshooter's handmade, full auto for running in Watoga, because I didn't made the quest there. One anti armour Assaultron blade, which I rarely use and may gift it to some newbie soon. And Hunter's pump-action shotty, just because I have tons of ammo, but If I see a shotgun base newbie, I will gift it to them as well. I need a .45 rifle to burn through the unnecessary ammo, but RNGesus is not with me, these days. Regardless of the ritual sacrifices I make with flying cancer rats.
---
Yus amazing idea
---
Yep that, and also merely don't want to use microphone period. 
---
I clearly have no idea what I'm doing. I picked perk cards that looked useful, like lock pick, or fun like the one that makes everything explode into a mess of parts and blood when you kill them. I use all kinds of different guns, depending on how I'm feeling. But, I have managed to make it to level 72, with many, many deaths occurring before I got here. 
---
Are you on Ps4?
---
What do you play on? Xbox, PlayStation, or PC?
---
All two-handers remain as such while wearing power armor. It's just a visual thing.
---
I wish they’d somehow indicate if you picked the perk specifically or got it in a pack. Then I can get a clearer picture of how misguided (or not!) 
---
RIP 3 levels towards Pipe Weapons perk. You were just a phase it seems, and I gave my Crossbow (ignore 50% armor) to the guy who gifted me the ‘light box’s’ plan.
---
RIP so much more
---
Fair enough, but what container are they using? Were all those prewar bottles we find a waste because postwar tribes all know how to manifest perfect replica bottles from thin air?
---
Explosive lever action
---
Yup, I've been there for one. She flies down near the text at the bottom of the map and gets stuck there.
---
now works
---
Right! Probably should have mentioned that. I have an xbox
---
So on what platform are you?
---
So this is what your people do?
---
&gt; 3,000 .50 Cal rounds
---
That's all you spent? I can double that in a single SBQ fight if it goes on long enough.
---
Can you take any of the Mothmen?
---
that is not a very easy question to answer.  Are you looking for a general questing gun? sneaky crit gun? SBQ gun?  PVP gun? 
---
Anyone who is 50+ has an innumerable advantage against someone who isn’t. You can’t “strategize” against a player that does more damage, has more range on their guns, has more armor pen, can sprint longer, has gear that provides numerous advantages, etc. If the actual movement and combat mechanics had a high skill ceiling maybe it wouldn’t matter but they don’t. You can run, jump and shoot. You’re not ninjaing your way out of a fight because the mechanics are limited. It’s all stats and gear. Better stats and gear &gt; worse stats and gear. Common sense.  
---
And if you’re trying to complete quests in a certain location you can’t just fast travel somewhere else unless you want to spend twenty minutes hiking across the map because some unskilled dickhead is camping a station. And if you’re a newer, lower level player you don’t have multiple fast travel options around the map anyway. The mode is designed so that higher levels can giggle about spawn camping weaker characters. 
---
You’re right in the regard that playing it is optional, however; and since it’s so poorly designed I’d recommend that anyone with sense just avoid it. 
---
Thank you
---
And the containers?
---
Are literally your words
---
It works. 
---
For that I wish they required either a beer bottle or a booze bottle depending on what your brewing.
---
Couldn’t agree more.  Also, talking of disability, I really struggle to hear the holotape dialogue. Fiddled with all settings and I’m still struggling.
---
&gt; Bethesda might not consider it a faction.
---
The Inside the Vault explicitly says 1400 caps, so all seven factions are meant. Besides, Grahm and the random encounter vendor bots already share caps with Watoga Station, so maybe the resident vendor at WS will be Grahm's baby sister?
---
I use stealth and a lever action rifle to one shot most mobs except lv 91 death claws / scorch beasts etc . 
---
Thanks, I've never timed it, how often do the attacks come to a workshop?
---
On weekdays I've only got about 1.5-2 hours to play after I come home from work. I do the Biv quest, sell to all the vendors and seems half my time is gone so I just try to knock out the easiest challenges. But probably taking a workshop at the start of the session, plus Biv, plus a technical data drop might do it.
---
Most likely a bloodied build like myself! Best setup to maximize damage output
---
I really hope this is satire 
---
I have memories of seeing weapons with over 1000 dmg output. I have never personally seen a weapon that does more than 300. I’m lvl 107. 
---
What’s involved in the bloodied build? Is that perk cards?
---
Yeah, I've gotten some prime plans but the biggest constant award has always been fluxes. Which is nice... But c'mon we want 3* items. 
---
Server hopped for 2 hours last night and have started again this morning. So far I got the bright light, but still need the targeting hud and jet pack, also the calibrated shocks or whatever for the legs. Then the build will be done. I'm currently rockin my t51 as it already has a jet pack but it was gifted to me by another player 
---
I'll have to remember to do events. I did a mission yesterday to finish the kill 5 scorched while drunk on moonshine and spent 2 min running around in a panic looking for the last one because I only had 1 jug of moonahine
---
I got instagasting hunting rifle, with perks it have around 150 writen damage, so to full mob 300. With sneak i do 2.5x or 3.5x damage (depends on day/night cycle) Thats 750damage. If things are same as in Fo4 most mobs have max 500hps. 
---
I have had to do that so many times now that I'm much happier to fight a real-life bear then place staircases or even build to a second floor least it happen again.
---
I hate getting into the politics of gaming, especially over Reddit, but I have to say I've seen more females in this game then any other online game I've played and I enjoy it. I have a number of vendors which supply my crew and about 50% of them are women or a husband and wife team which is honestly still shocking to me. They're always great to do business with and always straight up and treat my crew and I well. Here's to more women joining us in Appalachia!
---
If the material you need to build anything in workshop is green it is using the workshop materials if they are white you are going to use your materials 
---
What the fuck. You are what’s wrong with the gaming industry.
---
While we’re at it, they should just give everyone a full set of ass / sent armor and a TSE shotgun when you hit lvl 50 cause I dont want to spent time playing this game after already having paid for it. 
---
Whoever thought that hunting for good loot was something fun, clearly thats madness. I just want to get everyone on a silver platter and then cry on the forums / twitter / discord about the lack of content.
---
Terrible game, literally unplayable
---
Yes, and it sucks. I happened to start sobering up just a few days before it launched. It’s really weird seeing how pervasive drinking is in culture (at least mine). And it feels even more weird that it’s glorifying and making light of the addiction. Passing out after drinking isn’t fun. It’s painful and shameful and destructive. 
---
Let’s say each category.
---
Takes the right armour setup with the right perk cards 
---
Without the use of chems/craft items my bloodied death claw can have over 2000 dmg easily. Usually run about 35 pts put into strength to help this mostly from my unyielding armour
---
My bloodied lever can be over 500dmg and I have next to no rifle perks
---
That name... isn’t good. It’s just words that don’t actually flow together coherently. Something like Simplified Home Evacuation Device would be better. 
---
Be lever action sounds nice!
---
I'll counter that with where do I find the blood pressure cuff to make a Deathclaw Gauntlet?
---
The answer is... I don't actually care.  I know what mats are needed and will scrounge them up and make my magical melee weapon with the help of some random crap and the power imagination.
---
Bloodied is a legendary effect that makes a weapon do more damage the lower your health.
---
I've moved from 3x lvl 3 rifle man to 3x lvl 1 rifle man, moved some of the freed up perk points arround with no regrets.
---
Alrighty, what legendary 2* and 3*?
---
Ah ok. So I need to find a weapon with that effect?
---
I too heard they are animals, not scorched. No proof tho.
---
I need 19 pieces of Junk to craft five grenades and I’m not crying. You want the game to be something boring and uninteresting.
---
Invest in Agility and Perception, do at least 3 different level 1 pistol cards (for +30% damage) and max your rifle because it's the more effective of the two. Also make sure to pick up gunsmith and bloody mess
---
Thanks, does anyone know for sure? I only have 14 ultracite, so I want to be certain.
---
Yeah it’s an MMO.  I can’t keep moving closer to the screen then further away while taking off or putting on my glasses to be able to read a note.  
---
Yes, It was going to pull my aluminum and nuclear waste to build it for sure. The rest of the items were green. 
---
Haha I figured this out inadvertently.. I realized my new level 7 character was now #3 on the leader board. In a panic I started dropping mines outside my camp for protection and then BOOM! One goes off and I'm dead... And that's when I realized... Hold on a sec this is THE WAY! 
---
My group currently consists of a trio, one that built in a hotly contested zone and got camp blasted so many times he's built the ultimate tank build to counter melee and explosive into the dirt. During adventure he was the one to instantly go after even a 5 cap bounty. Then me, a heavy gunner that specializes in chems, and is trying to run a raider bar, and a third who just kinda fell in with the wrong crowd. 
---
During adventure mode if we saw 2 or more workshops taken, and the dude was level 50+, game on mofo! 
---
My role plays were for solo sessions. 
---
Now that survival has dropped, I've fully converted my main character, and they've got pvp alts they prefer to use for lower cap loss on death.  
---
4 for my melee build \~45 lbs.
---
1. bloody ss power fist.  main damage dealer
---
2. bloody ss combat knife.  backup damage with low weight
---
3. bloody explosive shotgun for suiciders, out of reach, and watoga legendary bots, and crippling SBQ
---
4. TSE Tesla for tagging mobs without dealing lethal damage in a nuke zone.
---
Instigating weapons are the easiest way to one-shot enemies.
---
Then there are bloodied ones. You do need to stay at low HP so it's a bit harder.
---
Certain TSE weapons can also do it.
---
These 3 will make it really easy to one-shot things without having to use a specific built.
---
Then you can spec up in a class. For example i'm a vats rifleman. I can one-shot enemies even without instigating weapons or having to sneak around. I use vats to aim for the head/weakspots and i can just shoot it. 
---
Obviously if you're a rifleman and you use some instigating rifles you'll deal a lot more damage. If you also sneak you'll deal a ton of damage. If you use a vats crit and you aim at a weakspot (weakspots give you bonus damage) you'll deal a stupid amount of damage.
---
Rifle build:
---
Max out rifleman perks
---
Covert operative 
---
Nerd rage 
---
Tank killer
---
Bloody mess
---
Gun fu
---
Adrenaline
---
Add adrenal reaction mutation on top
---
Grab a nice bloodied rifle
---
Stash is only 400lbs!
---
Bloody hell! Ye dunnae what i’m talking aboot? I role play in wow as a dwarf, but no i’m Not British:)
---
Bloodied explosive is king right now however the meta is changing every day as people test. But based on PvE alone bloodied explosive is best for a great all rounder 
---
I also use a lever action, just 3 points in rifleman, sneak attack perks in agility, crit perks in luck, one shot pretty much everything except high health/level enemies which are destroyed with a couple of shots and a crit. 
---
When I was younger and married, I wanted a wife. Someone to help out with the kids, clean up the dishes, go get the groceries, etc. My (now ex) hubs wasn't very helpful in the kid department once he helped make them. Now, as an unmarried adult female with adult kids, I'd love a wife at home to cook and clean and put away the laundry while I'm at work.
---
If Bethesda could get me a trophy hubs for the game, that'd be great. I'd get home from "work" and he'd have crafted more ammo from yesterday's haul, cooked up all the scorch beast roasts and deathclaw steaks, and boiled all of the water. He'd maintain my power armor and weapons while I sat on the porch playing my banjo.
---
It \*appeared\* there were already wires and connectors from the power box to the fusion core generator.
---
I had this issue yesterday, I just moved camp. It then stores all current "structures," so you just have to go into the stored tab and store it again. It sounds weird but that's what I had to do
---
Buy a second Xbox everyone!!! It’s way cheaper than 3 caps per item! Where do you find this excellent deal on buying Xboxes? 
---
But for real, I’ve wanted to start a second character but didn’t know how to transfer gear over. Optimize one for rifles and one for melee. Great until I loot a sweet bloodied explosive handmade... on my melee character. How do I move it to my rifle character? Enter SoloOrangutan. 
---
Not necessarily. While I’ll admit, it is a good effect, there are other builds to go for, like there is a sneak sniper build which doesn’t need any legendary effects to make it good, but if you were to get one with the stalker effect,  which is 100% VATS accuracy if hidden, but costs more AP, then that could also work.
---
You can hang walls from roof pieces and then remove the roof to leave the wall floating, with some patients you can make a building with no floors :) If you look up Jug on YouTube he has a video showing how to do it 
---
There is no need for this service at this price and difficulty. This mf gonna be on all the time? Lol okkk

4 hrs, 46 kills.  Bloodied guy got me eventually. 
---
Totally agreed as well. I think the developers need to ACTUALLY PLAY the first couple Fallout games so that they can be reminded what it should be like. This game wasn't made for 12 year olds who think getting drunk is "cool". Biv is just plain stupid. He doesn't even act drunk; he acts stoned, so they aren't even doing that correctly. The quests are lame, and involve "busy work" so boring it insult's the player base's intelligence. This is nothing but a lazy substitute for an actual plot. Seriously developers, have somebody actually play Fallout 1 and 2, and figure out why people fell in love with this series. What you have created doesn't even resemble a Fallout game. It's like you took Fallout and merged it with "My Little Pony" or something, thus creating a game that feels like it's catered to children. Do some research...it's the old dogs like me that are still playing this crap. My kids said this game sucks and moved on months ago. Try appealing to the actual fans for a change, before we all leave as well. You guys got a second chance because of how bad Elder Scrolls and Anthem were. Don't blow it.
---
Oh, thank you for the nice read and handy summary. To be perfectly honest I only started with Fallout 4 so I didnt know.
---
So we got the basic lore down to get us a Deathclaw suit. Could be a PR stunt for lore reasons to explain its existance. I want one. Please.
---
Bloodied explosive handmade, got ya, what will be the 3rd star?
---
It got bugged Again a patch or 2 back. Hook a fusion gen to the box and it'll work.
---
I wouldn’t wast your ultracite in making a primed receiver thats really end game stuff that only gives you slightly better damage over the hardened receiver and only be considered good during SBQ fights 
---
Most likely TSE weapon that used to add +200% damage + perk damage bonus on top of that
---
Think that's me you're on about, OP my post history if you wanted more info
---
Low health build. Commonly called a bloodied build or an unyielding build. It’s a combination of mutations, perks, and legendary effects. 
---
The main two are having a Bloodied weapon and having Adrenal Reaction mutation, both of which increase your damage at low health. Pretty common as well is using Nerd Rage for another... 20%? When you are below 20% health. If you’re a heavy weapons/power armor user, you’re probably using an Emergency Protocols chest for massive damage reduction; if you’re a melee build or a VATS rifles build, you’re probably using Unyielding armor for up to +15 to every SPECIAL but endurance, which increases damage for melee (strength), or increases accuracy/AP/crit rate for VATS rifles.
---
I have a rifle build rn but only with the rifleman perks. Didn’t know those other ones you’ve mentioned helped or that mutation too 
---
Elegant Table?  
---
Great! I def mean that for both wives and husbands. I'm married 26 years and that is def NOT how it rolls at my house! But this is a fantasy world right? A guy can dream.
---
Just play something else. You don't **need** to play fo76 and burning yourself out on it will only make you loath to load it up and come back later once there's more content. I went from playing 15 hours or so a week to 2-3. So happy I'm really enjoying my time in the game again instead of running around grinding for disappointment.
---
Will play more again when there's a reason to. I also think the upcoming quest line is neat... but ultimately its a once and done kind of deal, I want repeatable content. Why are they doing so much work on limited availability and one time only content? A week long event that upset the community as much as it made it happy. A quest that sounds intriguing and fun, but who knows how much work went into it for how much play time we'll get out of it. Sure would like to get that legendary vendor sooner than advertised... Or maybe player vending. Or hell anything that can keep me occupied. Nukes were supposed to be that end game content, but it takes too long to launch one and they're not really worth it vs just server hopping the right locations. It's just so unsatisfying.
---
On my melee about 40+ legendary melees. With the weight reduction perk they don't weight much of anything. Got a new poker for every challenge it's kinda nice being able to switch it up
---
Oh wow. Who said buy more than 1. I simply said having 2 is ideal. Most multi kid families these days have multiple consoles. Most ppl have friends who will do it for free. .1 - .5 caps per item MAX PLUS how can u get it if hes not on? This work around just isn’t feasible. 
---
What is your gamertag?
---
My Rifle Build carries a Handmade and a lever action as its 'standard' loadout. Although I'll break out a Gauss or Dragon from time to time. My 'main' character is a big guns Cryolator wielder and carries 2 Explosive Cryolators, a Vampires explosive Gatling Gun and TSE Combat Shotgun, A Mutants faster swing speed Sledge and on occasion an explosive Harpoon gun. Bear Arms perk makes all those heavies weigh practically nothing.
---
Doesn’t need one but could be anything you want depending on your playstyle some like reduced weight others want more perception for the vats accuracy bonus some want vats crit damage just depends. Isnt important everything will die in two shots anyways. 
---
I have a weird theory that is probably easily debunked and I have nothing backing it up but I still think it would be cool. Basically my theory is that the only place that actually got nuked was North America and the rest of the world is doing fine. The nuking was just an extreme test done by Vault-Tec to see what would happen to a population that was completely destroyed and if they could rebuild
---
Stacking damage modifiers. Back before nerf TSE would do 100% damage bost with two-shot, 100% damage with explosive and 100% damage from perk in intelingence. So i got pump shotgun that had writen 800 damage. Would oneshot everything. This is not such a thing anymore.
---
But you can do similar thing with bloodied legendary efect, adrenal reaction mutation, nerd rage perk and few more things so now you can have 4k damage with some melee weapons.
---
Me and the missus play together quite often , you're more than welcome to join us if you see us on. I'm of the old school mmo mindset also, and she just loves to make friends. My GT is Broromir, and when I can figure out exactly how to spell hers I'll pm you.
---
Sure always happy to help , GT KnowledgeHound heavy gun medic 👍
---
Not too mention no CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP HERE COMES THE POWER ARMOR CLANK CLANK
---
If reddit let me sent s photo threw chat I would sent you my card setup. My build is setup without the use of Power Armour as well. 
---
I finally fill my set of all unyielding with sentinel perks to avoid 75% of damage while standing still and use perk cards like dodgy to avoid dmg altogether. So even with low health it’s hard for pve enemies to kill me. 
---
Woah! It’s quite similar to my experience last night starting a new character in survival! I always have my weapon holstered and running the responders uniform... I guess they don't want factions to start up again 😭
---
Are you seriously overreacting to such a simple fix? Just remove some furniture. 
---
Imagine ruining a game for yourself like this. You know you can just not do these challenges? 
---
Nice!
---
People spending money on atoms is necessary if we want free updates, free dlc, and no subscription fees. Things cost money and we want them for free so we rely on people buying cosmetics to fund the development and server upkeep. That's how online gaming works now and personally after paying subscription fees for WoW for so many years I'm ok with it.
---
Just remember vault dwellers everything new they put in adds more bugs and glitches..lol seems 76 will be plauged with them for next 23 yrs the rate its going .. greafers in adventure mode rhats supose to be pve only are getting 1shot killed when lvl 100+ players are useing gernades and bunker busters to kill people
---
  I picked the perk cards that added benefit to the weapons that were working well for me at the time. Similar to you, I ended up as melee/sniper.
---
Agree with other posters that a 3rd specialty may be difficult depending on the card draws.
---
I’m just really curious about the taste of nukashine
---
Those people who said they’d quit came back, for the most part. 
---
I've never paid attention to them....
---
Yes, exactly
---
It’s 800 now!... are you saying Bobby pin life was rough back in the 400 days?  You have 289 bobby pins because you never actually needed more than 5-10 at a time. The rest is loose change for the vendors. Even when they weighed .01 for that short time 2x, I’d happily  dedicate a pound or so to my trust bobby pins. 
---
They are good, there is just no reason to use them, wait for new vault opening.
---
If they were pernament, they would be imba
---
Yeah I just stopped doing challenges when this occurred. 
---
-mushroom cloud in background-
---
the people that clicked on the PvP mode of the game are the people most willing to PvP, they have a whole mode of the game for people that want to play without PvP
---
My heart goes out to you, seriously. Stay strong! Positive vibes &amp; thoughts going your waaaaaaaaaay!
---
It is the same in my culture. Drinking is a part of the family.
---
Also, yeah, passing out/blacking out never leads to a good morning... in my experience atleast... but, everybody is different!
---
Another nice thing about the 1400 shared cap stash is that if you buy a plan for 1000 caps, for example, you can now recoup more than just  200 by selling stuff back to the vendor after your purchase.
---
What? I don't hear you over 10fps i have at top of the world.
---
I don’t understand how you have over 2000 dmg, can you please explain more?? 
---
It is rather polluted heavily over there, some of my Chinese friends actually like it over here better
---
Evacuation doesn't make sense either. 
---
Making a coherent, home-improvement themed acronym, where everything makes sense? It's a bitch.
---
“2 xboxes is ideal” - you are suggesting a second Xbox to solve this. 
---
Don’t like the service? Don’t use it. Don’t shit on this guys idea. 
---
It’s like saying “escrow accounts are dumb” sure maybe the are for you, but they serve a purpose. 
---
maybe you can have 1 bobble head and one maginze active at all times and switch em out any time
---
Considering the game is coming to Steam I am rather afraid that is going to be Bethesda saying "You have text chat now".
---
This. Almost all of the mobs are juicing
---
. 
---
It shouldn’t be hard to switch up a daily challenge rotation to not revolve around the consumption of alcohol. Just use the old rotation from before 
---
Naw this looked like ghe one worn by the bots not the halloween one
---
And it was on ps4
---
If its the same box of targets I think it is, they are for a quest/challenge in the toxic valley.
---
It obviously is if people are getting vocal about it
---
Top of the world station for me!
---
After running round to all the other places people mentioned, I was very excited to finally be able to just spell out “no” on the side of my camp :-)
---
76 Proof
---
I've got a few of those as well.  Alos wonder what they are used for....
---
I can see how some players wouldnt like their appearance changing by default. Getting a disease or mutation like those could unlock an appearance modifier however. Apply the ones you like after unlocking. Fun for RP
---
This is definitely some thing that is needed.  So much so we should seek legal recourse.  Seems like this is something that a publicly offered 'service' should be required to provide by law.  Anyone remember who those attorneys were that were responsible for dealing with the arbitration’s for refunds?  Seriously, this is a thing.
---
Okay thanks! 
---
Duping is gone
---
lol it really isn't. this sub gets vocal for everything, even non-issues.
---
besides, this sub isn't any kind of majority, let alone the few hundred that upvoted this.
---
Even if you are not going to do a bloodied build bloody mess is +15% damage on top of everything.  So definitely get that one
---
This is exactly what i'm saying. 
---
I agree, but if hey do this, they need to increase the difficulty of 3 star enemies.
---
She didnt vanish. She turned into a small meat pile somewhere nearby. Server caught up to your physics and then auto meat piled her.  Follow the physics of where she was going, or where she was when she died. The physics of after death get wonky with sync issues. I've had a meat pile be almost 100 yds away because my cousin was using an explosive 10mm.
---
I noticed that when I briefly played. Two or three people would “duel” which artificially affected everyone else’s survival time. 
---
Good idea 
---
Depends on your perks/level of the MMG.
---
I have regular MMG (L50) that does 140.
---
I used to have bloody mess in 4, thought it was only to make enemies explode in a mess lol, didn’t realise it helped damage too
---
I can see that. Like many other addicts I traded one vice for another and mine is now soda(particularly Diet Dr. Pepper) and I really want to know what a Nuka Cola tastes like. 
---
Sure  
---
It's tailored for my azerty keyboard, and play with arrow keys, you might want to adjust for your need, but you will get the idea.  Item navigation and build menu is on the keypad.  
---
The basic idea is to keep all default keybind in game and change everything in the script.  
---
Also I actually use 2 scripts 
---
one for wandering, one for build. When one is active the other one is disabled (I use F2 to switch script. F1 to suspend, if needed, you will need to fill the \[path to the script\] to your own setup)

If it was a device designed by Vault-Tec for use in the event of a nuclear apocalypse it makes perfect sense. For example, what did the people do in the intro to Fallout 4 when the bombs dropped? They evacuated their homes for the safety of the vault. Hence, home evacuation. If you had to evacuate, you’d want the process to be simple since it’s an emergency, hence simplified. And like the CAMP it would be one device to handle those specific needs. The name fits the theme and makes sense gramatically. 
---
That feature is coming in the next patch and isn’t limited to just PA. You will be able to rename all weapons and armor. 
---
The best fights I’ve had were from the organized teams (I mean death squads) that came to hunt me when I hit the top 3. Definitely agree with what you’ve said. 
---
Anything scorched killing challenges are best done in the Morgantown airport area, it is consistently all low level scorched that even the kill 76 scorched with a popsicle stick type combat challenges are quick and easy. There is also the Collision event there where you get several waves of scorched.
---
How can you even play like that ? I have a weight of 130-140 of 289. I carry 4 guns and like 70 stims and radaway. Got a few weapon reduction in gear thought 
---
disarm can traps you get alooooot of steel and lead
---
Attach an electrical connector to the surface of the structure next to the fusion core generator and run a line. I always place it about where the 3 muffin fans are located. 
---
What do vaults matter here?
---
Are you sure about that because that would be flipping wonderful 
---
Yeah, they don’t power it though... I agree think once you get the station back online it should just work straight away...
---
They are probably  crouched
---
I see your the second type.  I'd be interested in working with you in want to see if I can get my group formed first
---
For real? Bc I cant see a single one
---
Id prefer they do like red dead and give you an option to read it that gives you typed text. 
---
Unlike the other vendors, the Enclave only sells to enclave members. You have to complete a quest to get access to the bunker, after all, and MODUS sells some enclave-specific items, like uniforms, missile silo state holotapes, and so on.
---
Lore-wise, they also probably wouldn't want to associate with anyone else since all non-enclave personnel who showed up at the Whitesprings bunker were rounded up and shot. 
---
You can turn on captions for that.  That’s what I do. 
---
Understood, but some people don't want to constantly PvP while playing, even while on a PvP server. They may want to level or just get things done aside from direct PvP action. Others would probably want to actively hunt for battle, in which case the leaderboard is a boon for them.
---
For example on WoW, if I had things to do, I wouldn't actively hunt alliance in the area (unless they were camping an objective). In some cases where they were higher level, I would skirt around them or do something else until they left. Just because PvP is open season, it doesn't automatically that is the sole objective. 
---
So if the leaderboard is targeting the longest living player on the server, a person who is just going about there business with an agenda aside from PvP, it kind of makes it a pain in the ass and forces it on you. For those people, their only option at the moment is to server hop to remove the target on their back. 
---
Well, strength based SPECIAL load outs do have a lot of options, as unarmed/1h/2h/shotguns/HW are all primarily strength based. If you get a good spread of points in all the other SPECIALS after that you’d be able to pick up the support skills for them as well. I’m primarily a HW&amp;Explosives power armor user, but with my SPECIAL I can go full shotgun, or full any melee, or partial pistols (I don’t have enough agi/luck to go all in on pistol damage or vats, and pistols are weak anyway).
---
Melee weapon dmg increase the higher your strength. Max at 15 from your points you put into it. With unyielding at low health adds another 3 pts X 5 pieces is another 15 now 30 pts. Other ways of making it higher too threw cards.
---
Then there’s mutations you can require that add percentage factors like the talon mutation.
---
Sniper build can be fun at stealth surprise attacks but with melee I can run into a group of however many super mutants or even deathclaw and take them all down in seconds without relying on vats.  But it does take the right setup and the right gear which takes time to work towards  
---
Why would you buy another account? Just make a new character.
---
They said it somewhere i don’t remember where some  where in inside the vault or maybe Twitter they posted something. Definitely in patch 8 though I remember that. My whole discord clan currently is coming up with crazy names they are going to name their weapons and armor 
---
that's how I read it as well. you aren't actually getting a bigger pool of daily vendoring caps but just all of them at a single vendor if desired. I could be misunderstanding though.
---
so if you want to never go to whitespring you can vendor at a train station (say near your camp) and be done or travel to whitespring and see what others may have sold to different vendors (which is actually how I got most of my gear, buying what others sold since I had terrible luck with drops).
---
That's good to know. I did the Firebreathers final exam quest in the Belching Betty mine. I just made the mistake of drinking the moonshine when I saw the first group instead of waiting until I was further in
---
I try to give food to people whenever I see them, but sometimes it’s a struggle to get them to notice the paper bag
---
I didn't know that, does it also subside alcohol addiction symptoms?
---
Im all for it. Ill smash on some 3 star glowies! And i dont care if its a crappy 3 star, but atleast reward me my risk! Destiny had the exact issue a while back. But we all know that Bungie never fully learned from their mistakes. Right now Bethesda is in a good position for fans as we have them over a barrel. You can tell more that they are listening. Now, weather they execute properly is an entirely different argument lol. Ive been playing since day one of the beta. I preordered the power armor edition. I have been through it all and it seems that now the game is the best that its ever been do to all of this right here. Urging them for change and improvements. 
---
Im not saying we are 100% yet but we are loads better than we use to be.  
---
I carry 6 weapons. 3 melee and 3 guns. 
---
Mole miner gauntlet, pole hook and a buzzblade. All bloodied. 
---
Lever Action, combat shotgun, both bloodied.
---
And a vamps gatling laser. When I go fight the queen I swap this one out with a bloodied explosive prime gatling laser.
---
https://beth.games/2OwXxMc
---
Well thanks for letting me know that will be great 
---
I think that's part of the reason for the upcoming legendary character system, where you can effectively reset your character after level 50 and gain some kind of legendary characteristic. 
---
Can they also stop giving us duplicate perk cards in packs that we’ve already unlocked every level of. It’s so annoying when that happens. I have so many left to get and yet it seems like every pack is duplicates. 
---
Lucky me last time i got 3* uny marine chest
---
Alls I know is, is that my two shots are the only two guns that ever break
---
Just go nuts with a vats Sniper build. 1str/15per/1end/4char/5int/15agi/15luck. Perception is all rifle perks. Charisma is lone wander for damage reduction and AP regen. Int is for gunsmith. Agi is stealth/pistols/gun fu/adrenaline. Luck is... well, lots of options, but primarily VATS support perks. You can add in some Starched Genes or Class Freak or Luck of the Draw as you see fit. 
---
In my experience you have to spam the interact button a few times to get him to respond.
---
The enclave vendors already are at Whitesprings, you will just have to go downstairs into the bunker, just like you have to now. Plus, there are four different vendors with separate inventories down there... 
---
I'd love a faster shortcut to the bunker, though, so that instead of running through the whole building to the resort entrance or FT'ing to the service entrance (and two loading screens), we could just walk down a remodeled staircase from the new vendor room(s) that ends in one of the until now caved in rooms in the bunker. And if the hotel and the bunker could share one cell without loading screens in between, that would be awesome (but that's unlikely, given how performance is within each of the existing cells right now).
---
That's *absolutely* canon breaking that vault dwellers got to store their shit in a nuke-proof storage facility.
---
Why wouldn't you just have a lifetime supply of purified water and canned food? 
---
Listen man, my acronym was shit, but yours isn't much better. The actual name can be left to professionals, I'm just suggesting an idea.
---
Cool that is what I was wanting 
---
#1 reason I think.
---
🙂
---
Yeah there's always people who enjoy crap, to each their own.
---
What I want is an invulnerable walking chest on legs or similar that I can send back to camp when full.
---
I haven't seen the ones where you only have to visit a place, usually you have to take a photo at specific locations, and those have always worked for me. Of those, the trickiest were the survey marker ones where the marker plate had to actually be visible in the photo.
---
Vampires isn’t based on how much damage you do. It’s either a flat value per hit, or a flat % of your max health per hit, I’m not sure which. It’s best on fast-hitting weapons because of this. 
---
My last SBQ run was about 2600 but we also had about 7-8 other players engaged all at about my lvl 150 or above. 
---
I burned up plenty of other ammo as well including 100+ grenade rounds and who knows how much 5.56 ammo. 
---
I really don't see anything epic pvp related in this game...i like the game but as someone who has played fallout from the start it seems the development has taken a turn for the worse...it just doesn't feel like fallout to me...too many aspects missing...the biggest one being an actual story with characters and consequences for ypur decisions...having sidekicks and other npcs is staple in fallout and i think many of us miss it.
---
Right?, how can you play sober with so much instability?  You need to play while intoxicated.  That or risk a brain aneurysm out of out frustration.
---
And it isn’t canon-breaking that there’s a tiny box you can store a house in???
---
At least be consistent if you’re going to try and invalidate something. 
---
When vaults are released, you can look at magazines / bobbleheads like the buffs used before a raid in other raids.
---
You'll have your week to find the buffs you'll use, then just before you start your raid, you pop them and the 1-2 hour buffs should be long enough to get the raid done, or at least make it through most of it.
---
They create Scorched, they themselves are not.
---
“Your argument is that a level 20 player has equal ground to a level 160 player? That if they ... they'll have zero conflict?”
---
Those are your words. I am glad we clarified that...
---
Thanks to my unyeilding Max armor with weight perks I carry about the equivalent of 750lbs of legendary weapons on me at any given time. example, Gatling gun weighs 1.2 lbs and slege comes in at 1.9. I do this so I can store another 600 or so in my stash box. I only use the bloodied weapons normally unless it's an event where I need to let others tag enemy before killing. I'm saving all 2 and 3 star legendary for the legendary vendor coming in may.
---
Launching nukes in general doesn't seem worth the time unless you need nuked flora
---
Sadly, yep. It's like back to the good old days. I never leave a world, I just get disconnected. The .exe doesn't close, it just stops running once I have selected quit.
---
So you're saying that it's NOT strategy then? You've lost your point somewhere in there
---
Just please be careful as this can be abused in PvP, to take people positions.
---
But now you won’t get the chance to see it coming. Like how it would happen in real life.  There is a reason the army is not running around with rocket powered sledge hammers.  
---
The question is how can you know for certain any given player didnt do anything?  
---
Take the Parade - with a dozen on more people, 5 tasks to complete a parade - how do you know they didnt contribute to the pre parade tasks, or during the parade, you are in the front, how do you know what the people in the rear are doing.  
---
  Or you stayed in front of the yellow house taking out frogs, so didnt see another player behind the house taking out the 3 or so back there.
---
You waiting for the sloth, so never saw them take out a wolf or stingwing.
---
ad nauseum.
---
Im using a Bloodied Explosive Vats cost reduction Gauss rifle, and I can do 1400 damage on paper.
---
Price? 
---
I've got perfect vision when wearing my glasses, but I still struggle to read some of the fonts used to lool like a child's hand writing.  
---
For me the gaps between words is too small and the words seem to just blend together.  
---
My sympathies :(
---
GT: Necroprison lvl 58. 
---
That moment when you cry "I'm not crying."
---
Buddy, stop getting worked up. 
---
No need to have a hissy fit... Just change servers. 
---
Yeah I got disconnected last night on X1 was really mad. I was just walking to a point on the map after finishing my junk run and bam lost everything. 
---
I know, I'm willing to pay a hefty price, within reason, so here's to hope. I also have some of the most sought after armour sets I save for special occasions that I think can be helpful at working out deals
---
Some people just have better builds. If you can't hang, go back to adventure. In fallout 76, other players are enemies too and you have to accept that. Not expect everyone to be "handicapped" down to your level.
---
I strongly disagree after having spend 20h in survival.
---
I mainly hunted for the legendary enemys and in all my time only killed 3 other players.
---
I really enjoyed that I had to expect an encounter every hour or so.
---
Without this system I would not have encountered any PvP since I never went on to kill people.
---
You want the people with the most kills marked? You basically get that with the bounty system.
---
If you really really don't want to end up in the top 3 you can just kill yourself in proximity to your CAMP and reset the timer like that.
---
My only suggestion would be to only show the position of the top 3 every 10 or 20 seconds for 3 seconds so you don't know their exact location if they keep moving.
---
NO NEED TO HAVE A F**KING HISSY FIT!!
---
ThaTs pretty funny. 
---
So, to be clear, "the build" is the only thing separating those that "can hang" in survival and those that can't?
---
One of those nice dataminer folk uncovered some text in a recent update that indicated that your camp would appear on the map, in the same way as a Fast Travel point does as soon as you made your 'shop' active in your camp.
---
I'm really hoping that turns out to be the case, otherwise no-one would find mine either! ;D
---
Nothing about what I said implies I’m worked up. I haven’t insulted you or anything. I made simple counter-points to what you said. Don’t be that guy that tries to win a discussion by acting like the other person is getting mad. That’s childish and no way to handle anything. 
---
I'm sort of curious if they have to do anything at all, or if they could simply be collectables for bragging rights at your CAMP.  Even though their functionality as power-ups was true in 4, their abilities in 76 feel like afterthoughts.
---
Same as my username 
---
You have an explosive hunting rifle? Awesome! I've not seen even the crappiest example of a legendary hunting rifle so far :)
---
I LOLed a lot at this, LOLed less when it happened to me too some days ago...
---
I'd be ok with it if we could place ALL of the plants at our CAMP.
---
This poster made the exact same comment I was going to leave. 
---
If you power up Poseidon it's always a good idea to take the Sunshine Meadows food plant for a bunch of free Salisbury steaks.
---
Same method of operation with the power box, you just connect the box to the packaging machine and the terminal, set the terminal to Salisbury and you're good to go. 
---
There's nothing to win, this isn't a debate.
---
 Neither of our shitty acronyms would be the actual name of this suggested system which is never going to be noticed by Bethesda or implemented. None of this matters. 
---
 Have a good day dude.
---
I think this is a terrible idea. It's been brought up quite a few times, but this way would just guarantee that virtually no one would bring legendary gear into Survival. 
---
That would be delightful! I think mine is the same as my handle here. 
---
Wait, stabilised and sleek don't work? Well... there go my future plans. That really is a shame as it's probably the best looking armour in the game :/
---
That's cool
---
Honestly that sounds like a plus to me would put everyone on an even playing field
---
I do change servers. Every. Bloody. Time. Also keep in mind this has happened on multiple occasions. So yes, I am complaining. I have a perfectly good reason to have a hissy fit
---
I can one-shot most enemies with sneak crit on my TSE Gatling, but that's pretty much my only gun that can do this. I don't use bloodied, but it's pretty powerful as I understand it. 
---
That's huge lol
---
Now make it a zero cost travel spot and I can die happy
---
For the holotapes - there is an option for subtitles .  Handy for when it is hard to hear the tapes.
---
In my case. Yes there is a need to have a hissy fit. This has happened three times.
---
Yeah I agree Fallout 76 just wouldn’t be the same without legendaries. No one would play the mode if they could lose their guns and armor. It’s just those complaining about when they come ill prepared for pvp
---
Then they need to be extremely hard otherwise there will be a huge gap in output between the characters that can beat a 3star and those that are close to being able to beat a 3 star. 
---
What if it’s not about faction, and the BOS vendor bot is just an asshole? 🤔
---
How much?
---
I highly doubt you'll ever get anything back. But can I ask why? Why when it tells you there is a chance to lose aid items, wouldnt you stash the majority of them to ensure their safety? I know its crap that you lose ALOT. But my first thought was.. its Bethesda,  better stash it all. 
---
I'm not giving away my secrets lol. Seriously though, resource maps are a life saver if you wanna do anything specific.
---
You’re the M and this game is an S, get pegged fruitcake
---
pareidolia
---
Yeah. I should clarify that it’s not the leaderboards themselves I don’t like. It’s a good bit of competition. But the top 3 beacons is what I really don’t like. 
---
Mothman calling! Where is my church!? I demand all your lamps as penance!
---
The most straightforward way is finding an Instigating weapon.  One of the first 3\* Legendaries I found was an Instigating Combat Knife that did double damage if the enemy is full health and +40% damage on a power swing.  Pretty early on, with just a rank of each Gladiator, it was enough to drop the Watoga robots in one hit.
---
I don't know if I've ever seen it clearly defined how much extra damage a power swing does in the first place (seriously, does anyone know?), but at a minimum, I did 240% damage on the first hit, so that dinky knife was well into 400 damage territory.
---
Obviously, there is the Bloodied/Unyielding people which is an order of magnitude better and has already been thoroughly described here.  I'm just saying that if that's not something you want to build a whole character around, Instigating helps.
---
My plan was just to post a list of what my vendor will have on the market thread that way people can just hop to my world and buy what they want while I’m off playing because it’s pretty far off the path. 
---
I carry 2 handmades one is instigating for above reason second is antiarmor for scorchqueen.. both are explosive
---
lmao, you're not getting your aid and caps back. Get over it.
---
I'll buy some flux, I need me a anti rad arch!
---
Sure, but what if this AND that. That being Bethesda contributing. 
---
That's a neat idea. 
---
Kinda reminds me of the chicken races we used to have in Lord of the Rings online. 
---
Sorry, can’t hear you over my cowboys and Spider-Men. 
---
Have fun with that, though.
---
No.
---
I find it difficult to complain about anything with this game as I LOVE it, but yeah, enough of the alcohol related stuff. 
---
Yeah no worries. I want everyone to have access to the info that I've found. Happy hunting lady! :)
---
I found a TSE (2\*) hunting rifle.  That was an AWESOME day.
---
You really think Beth would rush out there half finished game, but have spent ages creating this stuff haha
---
If it's a bloodied build I'd say bloodied gun for sure; lever action would be my choice.
---
All the others you mentioned are great too, but maybe not as great as bloodied if that's the build you're using. I don't use a bloodied build and all my guns are either anti armor, instigating, or furious
---
Terrible idea, don’t go into PVP if you’re not ready simple as that 
---
Oh man I should've mentioned this specifically, I didn't think at the time. I know exactly what you're talking about and it's an absolute pain. Like how is it connected? It literally has steel girders to keep it free standing but nope that dreaded notification pops up due to the bloody walls!? 
---
I didn’t say it was a debate I said it was a discussion. And if you honestly believed that it didn’t matter at all and were so easily inclined to stop talk of the subject then why did you make a lengthy post detailing your idea and responding to everyone?
---
You conviently say “This debate doesn’t matter” to each person that levied a criticism at you. Funny coincidence that it suddenly doesn’t matter when people aren’t blowing sunshine up your ass, am I right?
---
Don’t make posts like this if you’re going to handle criticism poorly. It’s a waste of everyone’s time. 
---
So you only have to go to one vendor per day - anywhere on the map.
---
Thanks, stupid typo, my bad. Done.
---
I would prefer a way to trade in duplicate cards, for caps or maybe atom.
---
What build do you use?
---
Watoga Train station and Graham and the Lemonade stand are all the same faction
---
You quit over a camp 😂 grow up it was even described as a launching point when released lol customers like you are why companies rush and make trash games 
---
This would be great!
---
They didn't a month or so ago. I haven't had the will to try testing them again.
---
I currently have a full set of polymer ultra-light forest scout armor, that took WAY too long to put together.
---
At the time I was getting the pieces, the only mods that worked were the torso mods, and the generic "limb" mods, like ultra-light / deep pocketed (and their weaker variants), lead lined, and then the chest mods all seemed to work.
---
But I had to buy like 10 of them until I finally got 4 for limbs and 1 for the chest since they're indistinguishable in the trade menu. Then sold all the extra chest ones.
---
I haven't seen any mention of them though so that's why I assume they're still broke. /u/Crims0nwolf has a [good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad7fxu/enclavescout_armor_all_you_need_to_know_about_it/) about it from a couple months ago.
---
This is pretty interesting I'll have to give it a try when I next get online, thanks for the tip! 
---
That works too. Right now the duplicates just disappear if you have each level already :-/
---
Pretty sure it's 150%, ie normal damage plus fifty percent. 
---
What weapon are you using now?
---
I actually am so I may have to send you a message soonish if your available to help. 
---
Welcome to the Continental, Mr Shank.
---
If you have a good headset on you can actually hear a wirrr noise to as you walk.
---
How are they killing you? They do no slap damage. If fact, i had some genius firing a TSE exploding minigun on me. I just stepped close to him to get him in the range of the explosions, and he killed himself.  Hilarious.
---
Not better. Mow o have imagine that mechanic.
---
That is actually because it is game volume and not dialogue volume if i remember correctly 
---
Assume everyone in survival mode is running around with the absolute best gear the game has to offer. Anti armor or bloodied Explosive guns. Assassins sentinel armor. Bloodied, swing speed, +1 strength melee weapons. The works. 
---
How much for the exploding hunting rifle?
---
My "invisible" weight always turns out to be gun powder or ore lol
---
That's correct!
---
The C.A.M.P. items I’ve wanted most of all have been the posters and signage you see posted at all the Reaponders’ bases of operation. Expanding on that want, I think we should get all sorts of faction-specific doodads and decorations.
---
Also, I’ve found that mixing and matching wooden walls and warehouse walls gives a C.A.M.P. a nicely ramshackle look for characters who aren’t the best builders.
---
It would be nice if your shop showed up on the map, and then people could fast travel to your camp, or at least maybe see what you have for sale from the map.  But at least the map showing that you have an open shop at your camp is a good thing.
---
Wow and like a true child you teabag. Bravo!
---

---
On the roadmap.
---
Prevert?
---
Dont do them
---
Level scaling won’t work because lots of people have made second characters, knowing exactly what perks are required and passing down items. 
---
I have an explosive shotgun and a zealots handmade rifle. I’m using shotgunner and rifleman perks but they still don’t kill in less than 4-5 shots for shotgun and 5-10 handmade. It’s so frustrating 
---
I'll be your silent companion 
---
If you scrap it you learn the plan.
---
Ok thanks. I only have 14 ultracite, so I will keep saving it and hope that I get a good gun drop one of these days.
---
Sniper rifle, shotgun, pipe revolver rifle for low levels.
---
i think you did hit back and lost.
---
😞 
---
Good question. It's arguably the most forgettable since it can't even get legendary mods. If I could get a 3 star set, I would have some serious plans for it though. 
---
No idea. I've been hanging on to the addictol I find so I can do the "drink x-number of alcohol" ones and cure the addiction right away.
---
Lost 30 lbs of aid I have travel pharmacy and true hiker let that sink in
---
The game lets you tame creatures; why can't you use a perk to hack robots?
---
You can see what you have when you’re leveling up. When you’re at the level up screen just back out of it to your cards. 
---
This is my current special/perk set:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9cc15c5&amp;d=sf2s01sv3pd2pk2pp2pl2eo2ej4ed3cr0ic4a72a42am2au2l71lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Not a  straight PvP build, but it is very effective. It's more of an all around build for me. I really like having high AP and AP refresh; I also use speed demon and marsupial. Plus I use all the perks that add DR based on SPECIAL so even without power armor my ballistic defense is around 480.
---
I am planning on moving 3 strength over to agility so I can use moving target to get another 45 DR while sprinting.
---
I hated that. Every time it went off I'd jump. Glad when I finally maxed my INT out so it would stop firing.
---
Same here. Max that crit. 
---
Covert op perk, mr sandman, 15 points in perception for all the related perk cards, bloody mess, Eagle eye mutation. 
---
Very few mobs survive a headshot
---
1.5k caps or a max lvl bloodied handmade / lever
---
Why didn't you stash it ? Or mule it..
---
Just don’t trade and walk away I have hundreds of legendaries but all mine mine mine
---
Maybe there’s just one employee in charge of making it as trippy as possible. Probably the same artist who sculpted the clusters of mountains/landscape to resemble a dragon(s). 
---
Dragons! I must be so specifically deluded to only see dragons and not cows. 
---
A hunting rifle for sniping, a .44 for mid-range combat, a double barrel shotgun for damage sponges, a revolutionary sword for low-level animals, and a black powder rifle for high-level monsters. I’m trying to switch over to have a plasma thrower in the place of my shotgun, but first I need to get enough plasma cartridges.
---
Agreed, the info for the set was written wrong, it said you get the survivor outfit, survivor mask and survivor mask. Lol. I assumed the hat and mask would be separate pieces.
---
I’m using it anyway, and I do really like it, it’s different and cool, and I hoped we could paint the mask. I just find the bobble hat makes me look like a kid. 
---
You can’t blame people for asking, it’s a Gucci piece of kit. Acting like a dick when you say no is completely uncalled for.
---
I want whatever your smoking ;)
---
I built a set anyways cause I love the look and use power-armor when I actually am fighting things.
---
I'm really hoping that however they put the legendary vendor together I'll be able to get a proper legendary set of scout armor though.
---
Stuff like this makes me want to play even more, just so I can hopefully run into it in the wild. 
---
From now on, can we start posting our platform, and build area for these awesome creations? 
---
Not sure what system you're playing on but the PS4 has a built in magnifier, you just have to enable it. Xbox probably has something similar. https://manuals.playstation.net/document/gb/ps4/settings/accessibility.html
---
There isn't a consensus on this and I don't think anyone has actually run the numbers to find out... in part because these mods aren't that useful.
---
Vampires super sledge, all rise as a back up.
---
Two shot combat rifle for getting hits on SBs/SBQs before they land.
---
Oh I understand wasn’t trying to be rude good luck
---
Also should match the level of the enemy. I killed a level 25 ish 3 star and got a 3 star level 1 piece of armor
---
you on ps4? i can help you build later.
---
if not where you planning on building. what you want in your camp
---
I said the debate didn't matter to *you*, you criticized the fucking acronym which I don't care about at all. 
---
What armor are you using?
---
Lemonade stand?
---
So, you're flagged for pvp and complaining about people killing you? Seems there's a simple solution here.
---
&gt;	. I feel bad for the PC players that struggle with FPS.
---
They should switch to third-person then. 
---
🥁
---
everywhere is in walking distance to everywhere else. :) 
---
Busted. ;)
---
Im a heavy gun build with bear arms maxed so I carry way too many. They all weigh between 1 and 3 pounds and Im at the point where if I try to stash more than 3 I’ll hit the limit lol granted I’m trying to sell some of them and I just keep them with me for convenience
---
Off the top of my I know I have 3 missile launchers, 2 broadsiders, 3 fat mans, 1 cryolator, 2 harpoon guns, 1 LMG, 1 50 cal MG, 2 miniguns, 2 grenade launchers, 1 Gatling laser, and 1 Gatling plasma.
---
I also usually carry a shishkebab for trash mobs, a handmade, and 1 of 3 railway rifles depending on which one I’m feeling at the time.
---
Of this list, my go-to weapons are the handmade, instigating railway rifle, AA + 40% bashing minigun with a shredder for my melee, a two shot missile launcher with lock-on, and the cryolator for scorchbeasts.
---
I may have a problem 
---
You have to shoot the heart ve e e e e e e ery slowly or it bugs out, especially with explosive weapons.
---
I haven't had one glitch since I started doing this. Shoot, pause, shoot, pause, shoot, etc..
---
Any experience with the radium rifle? I'd imagine it would would be easier to handle than the gamma gun but don't know if the lower radiation damage and split ballistic would work out. 
---
Hey. HEY! GIVE LAMP!
---
I officially CANNOT STAND SENTINEL. I now have an irrational anger for this gang build. I keep coming across them and I unlock everything for them to take nothing and me to die.
---
I have yet to see any sentinel armor.
---
Wait what?! I didn't see that!
---
It’s cool when there’s engagement and battle not when is just a sneak fest not even using the game as intended killing others for no reason 
---
Doing a gunslinger/bounty hunter build. Revolver, Melee, Sniper, Shotgun. Inventory management is annoying but it’s fun to have a big arsenal.
---
New vendor as of the Fasnacht update.  He sells lemonade and recipes for lemonade and hard lemonade.  It's a Mr Handy at a booth (looks like Lucy's psychiatrist booth in the comic strip Peanuts) with some balloons tied to it.
---
His dialog shows that he really doesn't want to sell the lemonade - which is not made with lemons.
---
I don’t know if that counts as confirmation, but it definitely matches my experience. 
---
Hmmmm. . . I just went there a couple of hours ago before work. Got a quest, finished the quest, turned in quest. Weird you can't access it.
---
This sounds pretty fun!
---
Perks, mutations, armor and weapon effects, consumables. Find the right combo and its not hard to one shot stuff. 
---
Bloodied builds. Vats crit builds. Anti armor builds. There's different directions to go in. 
---
I have like 15 heavies on me right now. Bear arms is awesome 
---
I’ve got a max level instigating sniper rifle you can have.  It’s a nice starter gun to see if you like doing the while sneak/sniper thing.
---
You want it?
---
If you are in top 3 you will be seen by everyone even if sneaking  but if you are not in the top 3 no they shouldn’t  see you whle sneaking 
---
yeh i think it was a server problem..cos my friend jumped server and its accessible now
---
Yes with half of the stuff locked under 0.003 % odds 
---
Knock knock.
---
Who's there.
---
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
---
This needs to be a Reddit all of it's own. 
---
Why don’t we just call it a companion.  Bring them back from fo4 and allow them to be assigned tasks, like the settlement NPCs also from fo4.  Can’t be too hard for Bethesda to make this happen, right?
---
This happened to me and then I waited until level 50 to do the main quests so I could get the strongest version of the rewards (level 50 All Rise and the Stand Fast chest were totally worth it).
---
Faster than the &gt;15 second run from door to door? 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons
---
Scroll to the melee weapons. It tells you what all of them are considered.
---
Let me know if this happens to anyone else, but when I logged off the other night, I had over 2 hours on the Leaderboard. Logged in last night and that time was still there, boosting me straight to #4 so it looks like your survival time stays with you, unless you go over to Adventure mode then back to Survival?
---
The birth of KL-e-0
---
Yes. You will die a lot, but won't pay out much when you do, but killing people higher than you gets you double their level in caps. It's very low risk high reward going with a low level. And you'll have all that stash space to store extra aid items so you dont lose them. 
---
Nah, those should require effort. Set your charisma, get the perks, and go tame a buddy. We don't need everything to be convenient. Otherwise what's the point of the post-apocalyptic setting anymore? 
---
I paid 5k good luck 
---
The game is custom made for these stories. :)
---
They want it either because of the resale value, or so they can dupe it for resale.
---
It's pretty rare.
---
Yup.  That was a statement (of joy), not a question.  I'll probably walk in to the Enclave and check for shocks / jetpacks / stealthboy mods and dump everything there.
---
Or maybe I'll fast travel from my camp to the closest vendor - which is 4 caps away.
---
God this is gonna help me sooo much, big thanks 👍🏻
---
Lol yeah and when you join him fast travel on him , rip rewards lol

Sometimes it takes a bit for the door to load

You don't even play the game do you? Are you a YouTube content creator focused on Fallout 76? You sound like you are...
---
I do have an AAE RR. That radium damage is not much and ballistic even poorer; it also has crazy recoil. I couldn't really make it work on my previous Stealth Commando build - maybe smn can, but there are so many more options... Any handmade, CR, SMG or plasma rifle will outperform it.
---
I have a 65" 4K HDR TV and using an XBOX 1X. I have perfectly good vision...and I struggle to read the notes at a 8 foot distance. Why not use the old fallout 1-2 method of where it would "scan the notes" on the Pipboy? Which makes total sense. That's what a Pipboy is for. Kinda like a postapocalyptic personal assistant. They didn't expect the character in FO1-2 to walk around with a file cabinet worth of notes...this would also solve the readability issues.
---
2k

No. Just..... No.
---
Turn that ghoul slayers armor into sentinel armor? Are you fucking crazy?
---
Until we can quickly respec trading is a great thing... just imagine if we didn’t have it and you found a bloodied gun but we’re not a bloodied build..... that’s 30 levels just to respec to the gun you just found!

COMMIE MAGGOT *REEEE*

Its clear that the store/atom quests are designed exactly for that purpose..  They finally started making prices  within reason but took away the atom flow. I went from 30-100% completion down to 10-30%. The weekly quests have some bs requirements that i don't do. I never liked taking pictures but at least that one just eats your caps vs the hours and attentiveness you now require to do these quests. Such as this weeks crafting 15 different types of booze. I have the memory of a fish. Sure i know where to find 3-4 matts  in the wild and have a farm to cover 20 mats of any grow type. But its gonna be me doing research on the internet and taking notes for the rest. That's if i even have 15 recipes otherwise i might as well do some online money making schemes because the payout for those is higher than the 30 cents/atoms i would have received. Take that in comparison to say finding 5 types of flowers.  In the noob zone you can get 4/5 just by walking along the road. The 5th i had to just hop to one location. Overly easy...sure. But were talking 30 cents  fictional currency...for the week. Hell without the atom quests just what are we exactly suppose to be doing every day at this point. Holidays over and im not interested in getting my ass handed to me until im out of caps and stimpacks. Really the only thing that keeps me going is finding the small lettering and deep leather pockets on my alt since they changed how vendors work. I'm also worried that a bunch  of these quests coming are gonna be restricted with random variables like bivs. I am so tired of RNG carrying games its a pathetic mechanic. Its exactly why wows xpac tanked after a month and all 9 people i came back with quit within the first 2 months.
---
TL;DR- Atom quests annoying what do?
---
My favorite comment i got was that i was a racist biggot for not selling someone all of two shots, aae shotgun, all of my 5.56, and all of my stims. 
---
They also followed me around. I was fine until they started slapping me. I jumped on a rock, pulled out my explosive sniper and 1 shotted them 🤣🤣🤣 gotta love that sniper!
---
I dont have that problem with the auto, not at all. Its one  of my main weapons I use. 
---
Find a location worth sticking to.  Then you'll never be able to leave.
---
I moved here for the junk extractor and view, then placed my camp high up in a tree for a better view. Now I can't imagine relocating.

I'd be tempted to start it.. but I have no clue how to create a forum on here LOL

yeh iv seen that before..but thia was different

it said it was inaccessible..will be available at a later date...it was just before the server crashed.so.im assuminh that was it

Hmm I will look into that thanks

It's boss ghouls. The guys with the crowns next to their name. 
---
Bahaha yes! I could use a nice beak to crack open my melons also. Its all i eat.
---
Yep lead is the only thing I will go out of my way to farm for bullets. Everything else - screws, gears, springs, steel etc. comes from picking up all junk and scrapping it wherever I am and what ever I'm up to. If I was melee I probably would need to farm anything at all

I make a small ball of chewing gum and I paste it on the screen. It just works!

I think Sweetwater Special Blend also counts and lasts one hour.
---
Yea sure! Are you on ps4?
---
So basically, every player has stars from owning legendary weapons, they lose their hard earned items from a terrible RNG design or huge amount of caps spent to achieve those items, and will 100% get spawn killed and lose those items immediately. Sorry, your idea is complete crap. Go play DayZ if you want loot thieves. 
---
Maxpowers_69
---
They fled to the capitol wasteland. People in Appalachia were killing them off. Theres a note on a church door somewhere. 
---
They clearly say all vendors share a single cap inventory. So you could hypothetically drain the entire map from one vendor as soon as the cycle turns. 
---
I hope I am wrong, but I bet this leads to a lot more empty vendors than we even have today. Especially on the XBOX with duping still an issue. But I have been wrong before.
---
Thanks. That kinda sucks for the top 3, you know? I guess that's the point, but it gives you an incentive to not play the game normally and just have your buddies kill you every now and again to stay out of the top 3.
---
that would be nice getting to pick the name and icon would be amazing
---
I don't see what the problem is I always complete challenges while drunk. Oh wait...
---
I can get on for a second now if you’re on.
---
Easier headshots?  I'll take it.

Memory's
---
These mods would only be visble for you would they not? Are they reskins of in game clothing?
---
Yup, five seconds beat 15 seconds.
---
Okay, so the second door, got you. 
---
I'm a dick and couldn't resist. At least I'm honest. 
---
It's just a skin. I bought the Woodland Warrior but for now I prefer the Wasteland Walker as it may be better for PVP, at least a little bit. The Warrior is nice but a bit too dark for my taste ;)
---
SWEET! Thanks :) 
---
Completing Mayor for a day doesn’t stop the bots from attacking the vendor. When you approach the vendor the bots begin to spawn. As the vendor is the only hostile they can attack, they look for him. Once they are in range, he also starts actively looking for them. Once that starts, he won’t trade with you till they are all dead or you kill them for him. 
---
&gt; Only you and anyone else using these mods will see these outfits
---
Yes.
---
&gt; I replaced some standard vanilla outfits with them.
---
Alright, I may be on a little later than 5, I'll be waking up around then
---
So that means when I will have 1400 caps worth in that vendors per cycle regardless what anyone else has sold on the server? 
---
Well, if that is the case, then nevermind. 
---
Why not just wish for the game to play itself for you? Then you don't have to do anything!
---
They're both M81 Woodland but in different colors. I bought the first one on sale before Woodland Warrior came out like a dumbass. Beth def got me on that one. M81 is peak woodland camo though
---
it's funny how they haven't commented back to this yet.  I wanna hear a story.
---
Its all very personal. I like to use a 3-2-1 combo that gives 45% for 6 perk slots.
---
I’ve got a 3* level 50 mutant’s alloyed metal left leg. +1 intelligence, and food, drink, and chem weights are reduced by 20%. Not exactly what you’re looking for, but if you’re interested you can hit me up on PSN at radiationdaddy - I’ve got plenty of 2* and 3* armour pieces for sale. 
---
It is pretty dark in general, especially when the sun isn't shining on it. I like it.
---
Yeah i stopped playing after the legendary update, i hop on every now and then but it just feels... I don't know... stupid when you fight the scorchqueen and get nothing or a 1 star. 
---
What are you running the game on? A C64?
---
Not sure about a nuke thread bud the nuclear keycard doesn't reset, it'll just stay in ur inventory till you actually use it to launch a nuke.  Hope this helps
---
Bloodied snipers can get higher than normal dmg output with full perks and 9%-20% health. I have a BE black powder rifle that does 1046 base dmg, a stealthed shot at 2615 dmg, and vats crit at 4079 dmg.
---
Yeah servers bugs out , had it happen several times 
---
I discovered a couple weeks ago that Xbox has a magnifier setting.  Hold down the big center button and then push the button next to it with the 2 boxes.  Repeat to turn off.  I have same setup as you and I no longer have to choose between missing details and walking over to my tv.
---
I’m so glad I didn’t buy it then. Not a fan of that human skin (or wood) mask. 
---
Seems a good plan then. See if I can take folk out with my pipe pistol
---
Assassins rolling pin all day
---
Also got a 2* mutant’s marine armour chest piece, and a mutant’s raider chest piece. Both have +1 intelligence. 
---
Thx!!! I didn't kno there was another one will check that out too
---
Yeah, unlike foundations/floors with the different wood colors or carpet there is no "replace" option.  Which was a PITA since I have my water purifiers 2/3 under water right on the edge of the map.  I literally get a "you cant go that way" warning when I pull water out of the one and the top of it is at eye height.
---
So scraping the old ones and rebuilding these sucked pretty hard.  Got 'em though.
---
Your welcome I’ve read that some just kill them self so you don’t loose anything and can go about your business 
---
Go figures I didn’t expect other items to drop just stimpacks and so , it’s all good if I can’t remember I don’t need it just really bummed out I had 20 nukashines and 20 bubblegum and the list go on.
---
I did pull out my power armor frames from my stash and put in whatever was left over glowing mass etc ...
---
I carry a vampiric exp 10mm smg for a side arm because it's light weight, bloodied machete for a melee weapon of last resort, recently replaced my instigating lever action for a bloodied crit damage lever action I found, and carry around a vampiric gamma gun for spontaneous pvp, especially against bloodied builds. It's also lightweight. 
---
I have a combat shotgun or anti armor explosive handmade in my stash I can pick up when my game plans require it, usually for Queen fights. 
---
Just put an atom shop paint job on it. It'll no longer show up in any trade or vendor screens until you remove the paint job
---
However on the radio drama holotapes it just says **radio drama playing** all the time. So you don't get those unless you have good hearing really
---
This happened to me the other day off that was after stealing and cooking mothmans eggs
---
&gt;  There's simply no changing my mind.
---
I'm not trying to because you're trolling. 
---
You know they still want people to be able to play the game, right?
---
What really hurts it’s lead champagne and my 368 caps for that death 
---
No, you never actually said that it specifically doesn’t matter to me. You just said there’s nothing to win, both acronyms are shitty, and this didn’t matter. I have no idea why you’re trying to lie about what you said when I can just re-read your comments (which I’ve screenshot in case you go for a cheeky edit). 
---
Honestly, there’s nothing more to say to you. You’ve been completely unfair about this entire thing. You may have made this post with an idea but you clearly never intended to have any actual conversation about it. You just wanted people to think it was awesome. And it is a good idea, I just didn’t like the name and proffered my own suggestion which isn’t a big deal. 
---
When is it?
---
HA, thinking that you would get a pistol. You would probably get a 1* level 5 wooden left leg
---
i started a new char on survival, same methods of leveling, i actually leveled up faster, u got a 20% bonus exp on kills, not sure if it applies on quests and crafting too, and epxloration
---
This idea although good on paper and probably could be well implemented... But as you can see these people would never give up their duped noob tubes. I doubt the ppl who are nice n comfy right now would want any flaw changed from Survival right now honestly lol
---
It is possible to make it so no one can see you. It’s in the settings somewhere I think. 
---
Oddly enough ive done 3 prime queen fights this week none launched by me and 2 had huge turn outs.
---
Maybe harder to survive as more of a player vs enviroment thing instead of PVP. Perhaps like survival mode in fallout 4. Everything does more damage, sleep is required, less inventory so you have to pick and choose carefully what you want. maybe more diseased and radiated food? Hypothermia could be another thing during a winter. Who knows.
---
I'm kvl 66
---
Of course I play the game. From Beta, actually. I however, was unaware that the vendor caps reset for each player per server. I have often logged into a server where all of the vendors caps were at zero and I hadn't played in over 24 hours. I assumed that meant their totals were server-based, not player based. Basically a race to the vendors to sell.
---
But I dont understand how my experience of playing is so different than apparently everyone else in that respect.
---
So being wanted gives a chance to slap damage?
---
thanks !! Will try it :)
---
same problem they had for the Rocket Girl outfit. They eventually fixed that.
---
I’m entirely full in my stash... And I figured that it would pad the numbers with all that in there to keep my rare aid items safe enough to risk taste testing the new mode.
---
The skeleton extraction guide. Super creepy in game note that gives step by step instructions on how to remove a skeleton from a corpse. 
---
Plus below the perk card it has a counter of how many of that card you have.
---
Do you know why people could dupe items before? If an off server has to synch with unstable and slow game server that also has to synch with your PC, it will create a severe timestamp issue. Although your idea is good on paper, it does not work for a game in a real world. Bethesda has to spend a tremendous amount of money for a super server, maintenance, and human power to get this idea to work and they will not because it won't be profitable.
---
&gt; This is when they f**king loose it and pull out their two shot exploding 50 cal and kill me without me even hitting back once!
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/okp66FD
---
There is no damage at all anymore to players unless you shoot back.
---
Why you gotta lie?
---
So, I'm kinda stockpiling vintage Nukashines, I have 6 so far, 7th and 8th are fermenting, I'm willing to host this on Xbox one if anyone is interested. Caps back guarantee if server drops (will either write down the players names before hand or some other method) (to do the caps back thing I'll trade the caps for a random piece of junk.)
---
If interested message me.
---
   
---
You are going to shoot a nuclear missile with 3 hours of reuse At least if I shoot it I want to kill some player  maybe for the survival or nuclear winter mode 
---
They still haven’t fixed that?? x_x
---
Would love to see some brotherhood patrols, I can only imagine how interactions like that could go, especially if any other factions are about that are against them.
---
You dont have to sacrifice a lot of homework to mak bloodies the best option. Running at 50% jp will give you a 45% boost in paper damage.
---
and no ammo needed...
---
Shotgun and knife here.  50 cal for scorched....
---
Same here on the perks, I lost about 50 pounds in just two deaths...
---
Is the black camo paint the "woodland warrior" paint because I'm 99% sure that's just a darker green.
---
Don't trade with randoms
---
I am on XB1. 
---
Just wanted to see what people have as camp to get some fresh ideas.
---
They do have a variety of settings for people with disabilities. 
---
When dealing with disabilities, there's a term "reasonable accommodation" that gets batted around a lot.  Clearly they have already got some settings to help individuals with disabilities. This is just one they haven't considered or implemented. 
---
Jumping straight to a lawsuit seems very premature and counterproductive. Asking nicely and trying to make sure that the request gets heard by the right people makes more sense. 
---
*is nobody paying attention at BGS*
---
There's a 76 settlements sub
---
Do you get a notification if there’s a bounty on you?
---
I also do not have Radicool in my End. I have Dromedary, Lead Belly, Vaccinated, Aqua Boy,, Chem Resistant, Good Doggy, Slow Metabolizer, and random others but no Radicool. 
---
On the bright side getting rid of that weight gives me another approach take off those 6 points and invest them somewhere else.
---
Use them only on farm runs 
---
Went into the Wendigo cave expecting an epic fight at level 38. It dies after I hit it 2-3 times with my regular super sledge.
---
Caps reset 20 hours per vendor type from first sell. Exp. at 12 noon you sell 50 caps to responder bot in Flatwoods, 12:30p you sell 150 caps to responder vendor at Camden park. 7am next day you go to responder vendor in Grafton he'll have 0 caps. 8am he'll have 200 available. You may need to sell something to him to get the caps to show up as available as that's bugged.
---
My ghoul slayer one shots all the ghouls at WS
---
Yeah i brought up a similar idea. Lots of pushback from all the knuckle dragging brads and Chads with splody things and definitely-not-duped-ass-sent armor
---
But.. you're stealthed. The effect is applied to weapons as well because then people would be able to see a floating weapon just strolling through the wasteland. So obviously your sights will be invisible as well.
---
Either get better at knowing where your sights are or just quit complaining about a *realistic* detail 
---
But does that magnify everything?
---
I've just been using an old pair of binoculars. 
---
I used to run with a sniper rifle as a primary, pistol sidearm, and a bowie knife. Now, because of perks, I carry a sniper rifle for long range, a lever action for mid to short range, and a hatchet for those close encounters.
---
Cool, are you the person in charge of that? No? Interesting that you felt the need to be an ass...
---
Well, I know you have to get the item from a cargo bot. But you also need to get the codes from ghouls and those still reset right?  Or do you even need them?
---
They don't have suppressors, so it won't be easy.
---
1 hour to do the silo dungeon plus killing the queen, with your low level friends and....? a 2 star piece of armor with trash perks...
---
At that point, it's more profitable to farm whitespring for an hour, at least a 2 shot fatman and bloodied dragon rifle are good, even if 1 star.
---
If you must spend time in a dungeon and subsequent boss, reward the time spent there. Maybe reduce the pool of legendaries only to the decent ones, leaving out trash tier things
---
Whenever I notice I'm suffering from alcohol addiction, I just drink a beer. Clears it right up.
---
I did some testing last night with a friend and the whole thing is either bugged or there are some special times you aren’t shown.
---
We are on Xbox. I was number 1 on the list and my friend didn’t see me even while crouching standing, sleeping, anything. 
---
The other thing we noticed is that the dots and the list don’t always match. A lot of times I was first in the list and showed as 2. And even looking for other players, the written list didn’t always match to the map pins.
---
There were many times where none of the blips were showing as well.
---
Need to test more but the feeling I was left with was that it’s just buggy.
---
really
---
Honestly I’ve played the game for just over the 76 hour mark and I’ve compiled a very nice amount of weapons and some of the best armor in the game, whether it was duped or not I don’t know probably was but I earned all of it with caps I earned through playing. These “end game” armor and items were easily achievable through the market. So I don’t feel sorry for anyone who steps into PVP and can’t hang. Sorry just my opinion. Now I can agree with people being marked as legendaries and those kills go towards the gun bonus at the end of the week. That idea makes sense to me. 
---
Exactly. Know your sights. Plus the stealth field effect extends to weapons as well, why would just the sights be visible?
---
I've wanted this for so long, just so I could see my boundaries.
---
Either this or the ability to walk around while in placement mode to see it. Like "hold LT to move camp" 
---
Grenades and mines help a bunch too.
---
I watched a few videos, and people seemed to change a lot of walls back and forth from wall to doorway to get things done that didn't want to work.  Try changing the walls to doorways and seeing if you can delete them, or place a foundation once that's changed.
---
Thanks for the reply. Apparently, I AM dense. ;-)
---
You do need better armor than running around in PA, and you do need to pay more attention to your HP, especially if you want to maximize the damage output.  
---
It is a good build but you need to be a bit more careful. 
---
Sometimes you just need to add a foundation. Not to anything in particular, one just has to be somewhere. 
---
This has just been proven true, at least on this subject.
---
I'll definitely check that out. It would be so easy just to have a zoom button for the images. Kind of like when you're shopping on Amazon and want to take a closer look at that shirt you're thinking about getting. 
---
It's just an image file. 
---
Pretty mixed set...I have a 3*BOS combat chest piece that gives 20% weapon weight reduction...I think 2 metal pieces and 2 marine armor; one leg and one arm of each. 2 of them have a 50% fall damage reduction so I can survive any fall without PA which is nice.
---
That's correct.
---
No worries,  that's what the community is here for! 👍
---
I said it to you. Not that it didn't matter *to you* I'm saying I *said that to you.* 
---
You said I said it to every person who disagreed with me in the thread, which is bullshit. I then edited because I realized I did say it to *one* other person.
---
I've had a sign up in my camp, *Companion Services 1000c*, for months and not once has anyone taken me up on it. Id drop essentially everything except for heals and 2 weapons and act as a companion until you log off. I thought I was onto something 
---
&gt;melee stuff weighs next to nothing.
---
Xactly!  No reason not to carry a knife.
---
Same same same, i took a screenshot of a note once but when i looked at the screenshot it was bolder, so I dunno whats going on 
---
LOL!
---
I'm good, my camp is on the shores of the former Somerville lake.
---
It doesn’t feel like it’s related to damage but rather a small percentage of your health per successful hit.
---
But I’d be interested in seeing some actual data and not how people like me “feel” by comparing multiple weapons.
---
Thats a feature in so many games, this should be standard 
---
Thats weird man, thanx for the report
---
Yeah but the subtitles could be bigger too! 
---
I empathize with your position, but to provide a slight counter opinion...
---
Many of the challenges are unattainable for those of us who are low levels and only have an hour or two a week to play, too... so, for the player base as a WHOLE, I think it works out.
---
Bethesda has to provide an experience that both entertains the four hours a day, 8 on weekends players, AS WELL AS creating a compelling game for both new players and casual players. Otherwise, it's dead in the water. This means compromise, and compromise means someone will ALWAYS have something to complain about. Leveling rewards, are most likely targeted at lower level characters that CAN level three times in a day, not at lvl 137 players that are now grinding for godhood. Face it, by lvl 137, you should have enough atoms to buy out the damn store twice over.
---
I sold for 1100 cause I had an auction for it, and that was the highest bid
---
Hey that's where my CAMP is too!
---
By the time you have a bloodied weapon you will have BOS heavy combat armor and won't have much of an issue in pve. Heck I don't even run a bloodied build and I run around at 50-60% of max hp with no real issues.
---
Hmm good idea. I just fear getting put into the top 3 and I'm only level 5 haha
---
Not really 
---
It seemed a like a neat idea. Obviously you are trusting people but the game seems to test  your ability to trust people a lot I’d say. 
---
This could be useful for me to move a few good weapons to my second character. Thanks!
---
love this idea!
---
Exactly. The most satisfying thing achievable here is to come out victorious from encounters where you see what your opponents do, you are full of admiration towards that, and barely win with your hearthrate unhealthy and your palms sweaty. Facerolling the roleplayers that want it deadly is low. I am pretty sure there is certain PvP-compatible group of people that don't shoot others on sight. I seen people that were powerful (not freefrags for me) that were randoms I met that were not aggresive initially, but that could take my 2nd tier build down when all the hell gone loose.
---
When I say 2nd tier I am not saying its bad or my character lacks items. I actually think that the majority of the players are behind, know shit about the nowadays meta, and the gear thats still the most expensive is just 3rd tier thrash (I'm looking at you assassin-sentinel obsolete dudes), I think I am a whole generation above that, yet I know there is now a whole generation that is above me and that is two generations above the so-called meta.
---
They can’t make it too cool or else we won’t wanna spend our atoms on something else hahaha 
---
you do not have unlimited storage like you did in FO 4.
---
Scapping unused weapons yields learned mods and materials, adn will reduce weight.
---
packrat perk helps a lot, as does the ammo weight reductin perk.
---
Fans, typewriters, watches, and clocks yield screws and gears.
---
clipboards yield wood and springs.
---
@L49, have yet to find a use for fiberglass.  
---
the most improtant chems so far have been radx, radaway, and stimpaks.
---
I keep less than 5 of any other chem.
---
Fiber optic use is limited, as is glass, bone, crystal, cork, and coal.
---
mutfruit, tato, corn, and purified water make vegatable starch, which scraps to adhesive.  Which you'll need to repair almost anything.
---
military ammo bags scrap to ballistic fiber.
---
Reisist the temptation to collect Power Armor frames - they weight 10# each.  You really only need 1-2 for the component parts; the component parts, if not installed on the frame, are 12-18# each.  
---
Has to be read by the Harpers Ferry bot. He has such a soothing voice. 
---
Yes... the one other person that disagreed with some aspect of your idea. So my comment was accurate in that you said it to everyone that disagreed at the time of my posting. 
---
You could look at it as two people, or you could look at it as 100% of the time. I really couldn’t care less which you decide on and this is my last comment I’m making here. Cheers.
---
You kept your mind opened and hence chances are you'll end up victorious at some point.
---
Please keep being yourself. 
---
Hmmm, ok, was killed recently and the caps lost was my level+100, but I didn’t get a notification of bounty or did it show up on the map, so how else does that happen?
---
There are no plans for X01 mods. You have to buy the mods from the enclave bunker
---
Butthurt little child.
---
I'm the opposite I want clean nice walls. hopefully we get both
---
Lately those events have popped for me when I fast travel to Welch and Grafton train stations.. thought it was odd.
---
well said!! i agree with it all
---
Dope vid..which gun is that? Also ..no chameleon?
---
When you die you still lose caps, no matter what 
---
human...skin... mask?
---
Oh hellz yes. I need to see this thing...
---
Good point,but i would use the same logic,for a every day farming session,or pvp session. Making 1 effect unlimited with a perk,would let you  be prepared for everything anytime.
---
I’m with you, OP. Love the mask, would be perfect alone or with other hats.
---
Thats a pretty good gun. Certainly not trash. 
---
Vamps works best on high fire rate weapons. Crit filling and damage work better on low fire rate weapons. So a gatling gun, with a speedy receiver, might be a good mix. 
---
I think it's worth hanging on to if you got room in your stash. Might make for a nice backup gun for queen fights.  
---
Yes but I thought you lost caps equal to your level..
---
Ah, that explains it. At least you admit what you are. Carry on little boy, sensible people with logic at their disposal are talking here.
---
I hope so too.
---
I’m also holding out hope that we get some way to upgrade the alien blaster eventually to return it to its former glory 
---
Watoga vendor has them. The jet pack plan is around 5900 caps. Just saw it last night and have seen it there plenty of times before. 
---
No, you lose double the caps
---
Well obviously this would only work once all the current spawn camping stuff is solved 100% as it is right now yeah it would totally suck
---
There is actually something here.  However, the player shouldn't actually drop their own legendary, it should spawn one in the loot based on regular loot pools.
---
Which would lead to two people heading off somewhere, one loading up all the legendaries and handing off caps and aid to the other player.  Then they spend a few hours playing target practice and build a huge pool of legendaries.
---
Game balance is **hard**! 
---
The ending sums up my experience entirely.
---
Server not responding.
---
Welcome to main menu
---
Ah ok!
---
I think the PvP tracking would be more fun if it worked like the Brotherhood quest where you're finding transponders. An Aliens-style beeping signal that increases in frequency of blips as you get closer to your target. I wouldn't mind having that active for all players, not just the top three. 
---
We know, we were all here yesterday.
---
Btw I love how you guys are all assuming I don't have this stuff already
---
There’s a small tent setup near west tek called US BIOVAC or something and in one of the tents there’s a map with a few pins on it.
---
The pins are west tek, Huntersville, crashed space station, and I think one or two more.
---
Don’t have a pic right now but when I found it, it caught my eye. 
---
Well he could use the banjo as imagery for the running section
---
I've just walked past at least 5 players under level 30 (even though 30 can be quite dangerous in survival) and let a paranoid level 4 attack me with a knife lol.   I'm sure some people would not do that but not everyone is hostile.  Don't get me wrong, I will kill people on occasion unprovoked.  XD poor guy shot me in the back yesterday, did minimal damage cuz I was sprinting with cavalier.  Punched him while he reloaded xD
---
I'm with you on the glass. It would finally give a use to all that's laying around. Wood makes sense for boiled water not only for the fire for cooking and boiling, but because it looks to be stored in a paper milk carton-style container, which requires wood to make the paper.
---
That's a damn shame. That hat makes it a smidge too goofy for me, lol.
---
What are you offering for the mod?
---
The survivalist outfit in the shop. It’s meant to be a wood mask but all I see is some type of leather face situation going on haha. 
---
There's a wendigo in Monagah too 
---
When it happened my first thought was. How’d he get the server to kick us all at the same time?
---
Part of me wants to think it was bad luck. Part of me thinks everyone in the game is out to get me. 
---
Beer is for shopping, Whiskey is for fighting and carrying more stuff
---
2k caps?
---
The general consensus seems to be that the only thing that adds damage dealt to SB and the SBQ are prime receivers. Which makes sense, why bother with the flux prime ammo if animal, zealot or anti-scorched do the same thing. I've never seen any real numbers on this though.
---
Well... I'm a IRL leatherworker. You carve the wood into two halves of a container, glue 'em together, then wrap them in leather... 
---
...and you get a flask/canteen.
---
You are scaled. A 35 in shortbus 3 shot my 326 char. 
---
Lol. Damn creative dooper
---
I agree, I have zero interest in fighting the SBQ again.  Such a waste of time and resources as you  mentioned.
---
I’ll be on later tonight around 7pm british time. My username is ZzappBrannigan 
---
I think you need to go to bed, friend.... lol.  
---
Okay but for real, real talk, I'll frequently think I'm seeing Mothman hiding in the woods at night around my house but it's just some firecracker berries off in the distance, lol. Definitely an "ahh, well played Bethesda" moment.

I need to check this out when I get home today.

Someone may have sold a mod to the vendor, but I can assure you that there are no plans to craft mods for X-01 armor.
---
I’m sorry you think fo4 survival = fo76 survival.  
---
He duped 150 caps 8 times!
---
Fixed 
---
And yet it's always the bloodied that manage to drop their paper bags.
---
I'm a moron, at the start of the clip i lose 20% hp and do correct me if i'm wrong but X-01 has more defense than a regular set of combat armor. If i was to use a basic set of combat armor i would have lost more HP.. If you start at 50%hp and you lose 20% more, well, things are getting hairy and you do need to pay a bit more attention to your hp.
---
Bloodied is way easier if you have unyielding armor. Getting enough pieces of that isn't the easiest thing. Then there's the ballistic fiber you need to repair it... 
---
This is the point that i'm trying to make. Bloodied requires more maintenance than just repairing your PA once every 2 weeks. And yeah you could try bloodied+PA but i honestly wouldn't want to do that, an encounter with a deathclaw at the whitesprings can be deadly. So far i never died from pve. 
---
There's less room for mistakes using a bloodied build it's a high risk-high reward situation.

Oh hey instead of rewarding you for surviving this long let's fucken mark you on the map because there's a settlement that needs your help
---
Hm that’s strange you don’t have it, I know I never noticed it though until not long ago and I’m level 119. My friend who’s level 66 had it on his list of cards for a while. It’s a pretty easy card to over look though. Maybe your next level up do a double look for it, I’m pretty sure you might do what I did and pass over it

I just killed a 4 star ghoul and no drop  super pissed.

No thank you.thanks tho. Gotta match and need the +1str

Have 2000 hours in the Fallout franchise over 2 consoles and PC. Game looked bad at start, but gave it a chance anyway, knowing what i was getting into. Up and downs at the start but now i have a discord with 50+ friends that i made along the journey and we always play togheter. Currently sitting at 350h in Fallout 76.
---
What? They are scorched....beasts
---
I RP as a narcissistic plumber.  I'd love a clean toilet, bath and a mirror.  :(  No shower needed.  I love myself too much to rush my bathing. 
---
I wish I remembered what I paid for the mod at the vendor now. Make it 3k and I’ll sell you mine if you want. Psn sneazel
---
When did I ever say that survival mode is the same between the two games? And where did I even mention survival mode from Fallout 4?
---
Oh that’s right, neither of those things happened. 
---
You make a good point there, Id be happy with an area marker that shows a general idea of where someone is, in lieu of a precise marker.  That way you still get the pvp, but not the disadvantage that comes with being top of leaderboard.
---
Salty child

yeah that parade patch really borked the servers again, its such a  shame
---
when you get disconnected at the SBQ fight and she is almost dead...it makes you not want to even play the game for a while

the most BASIC thing for an online game is to have it be able to be played online
---
The charred one at the entrance to Camp Venture always has 4x of 4 different drugs on him every time I've been there. And as was previously said, the One Violent Night event at the Sons of Dane compound. Holy crap I've never seen so many chems drop. Did it last night and got several dozen stims, radaway, and rad-x and a bunch of other misc chems. 
---
I play from 6:30pm - 10pm CST  being you are posting now while I am at work probably tells me you won't be on during my play time.

but if anyone else wants to hang out and have some fun and perhaps RP if you are into that. I play on PC  discord.gg/hzvCRFA

---
I just read in the Fallout Reddit "A multiplayer Fallout lmao" argh
---
Then they’re not fallout fans. I preordered this game without question because I’m a Fallout fan. I knew the bugs would be there because I’m a fallout fan. I unlocked every achievement and am still playing because I’m a fallout fan and the devs are still working to make the wasteland a more stable yet more chaotic place for us to play in. 
---
Let the butt hurt flow thru you
---
What stops someone who knows they’re going to lose from actively leaving the server and claiming a disconnect?
---
I guess the fact we’re just talking about 150caps makes it a “who cares” situation.
---
I typically carry 3, rotating them based on what ammo I've got the most of.  Sometimes I'll carry a sword too. no crazy legendaries... just some 1 star stuff.

Unlikely. Challenges are all Account based so far

---
Most major FO76 discord channels have some form of nuke notification/announcement system implemented (by users that launch the nuke of course).
---
Also, silo cods reset weekly. You don’t necessarily need to decipher them yourself (plenty of sites out there releasing deciphered codes every Monday).
---
I assume these were the ones in emmet mountain disposal site?
---
Fair enough. Elaborate, but fair enough. Bottles would still be easier though. 
---
QQ: How would you make Wood Armour when we have adhesive, cloth and wood scraps though? Even the best and brightest chosen to rebuild America couldn't figure that out    /s
---
That's what i've imagined but maybe they implemented it differently this time since it is a special challenge and all. Can anyone confirm this from experience?
---
&gt;There's simply no changing my mind.
---
I won't even try to because I know now that you are just trolling. 
---
“Join a team before fighting a queen” should be everyone’s slogan in FO76.
---
Damn!  I would think if you can store them and switch there that you should be able to do the same from the actual build.
---
/Valseek - can you get this noted also? The "replace" option isn't there for this item but is for most other Atom shop variants of other items.
---
I agree with this. I wanted to play with the increased danger of random encounters with possibly hostile players. I didn't want to be guaranteed a target by everyone on the server because I just spent the last hour at my camp crafting and building. 
---
How are radium rifles in PvP? anyone try em out yet? i havent had the cojones to try survival yet
---
Sounds good
---
&gt; power swing ?
---
Beginner question, but what is/how does one do a power swing? (PS4)
---
To be fair, you got a Nukashine AND a good story out of it. That's not bad for 150 caps imo! 
---
Dude shut the hell up you cheated and got banned that’s what happens. You think Bethesda gives a single care about you? Surprise! They don’t. You are just another cheater who caused issues they had to fix.
---
And don’t try and be like “but I didn’t do anything”. Because that has already been debunked and proven that everyone who got banned did ACTUALLY cheat (besides one single case where the guy spent 300 hours in game). None of us feel sorry or care about you since you decided to use exploits. Glad you got banned tbh and I hope they don’t unban you for at least a year.
---
Wasting a ton of ammo for a 1 star or possible disconnect? No thanks. 
---
Haha I thought of that too and the sad thing is it might actually happen this way.
---
No, but if you're on the top of the leaderboards for survival time your location pops up on the map and encourages everyone on the server to come and kill you.
---
Sorry, can't hear your ragepost over the sound of furious Brony fapping. 
---
Praise the Sun!
---
Yeah several seemed to say the same so I guess it's been changed, odd.
---
I also started playing around december-january and by some miracle i'm not banned.
---
Also checking your post history it seems that you've also got banned in GTA V at least once.
---
I don't really believe you when you say you're innocent. 
---
Ok but I need an overboard too.
---
Trusting Bethesda to do something right the 1st time is scary.
---
  Not really trying to put them down but lately it's getting harder and harder to trust that they know what they're doing.
---
 A text chat for an online game is abosolutely necessary.
---
 As of right now on adventure mode I completely ignore and run by every single person I see because I have no way to communicate with them.  I feel kind of bad and rude but I do not know how to do Morse code with those silly Emotes we have.

what I would like to know is do they stay at your CAMP if you unequip the perk?

3 star weapon:
---
Instigating 10mm submachine gun with +40% bash damage, and +20 energy resistance while reloading
---
It is clear bethesda hasnt given a shit about the consumer since the canvas bags . Did i ask for youre pitty or for you to unban me ? nope . I WANT BETHESDA to see this . I want them to know they are driving thier customer base away and to other developers . im sorry you have to cry about it cause your mad at a random person on the internet . im sorry you suck off bethesda once a day just to show them your a true "FAN" 
---
All are good ideas. The need for neutral zones around spawns and event areas definitely needs work. 
---
A squad had a workshop and the event came up for them to defend it. I was then able to fast travel up there using the event and kill them all. I feel like that shouldn’t really work that way. 
---
&gt;  you are forced to do so if you want the related rewards. 
---
Child... That's like saying I'm forced to rob a bank because I want a million dollars. You can want something and not need to get it. If it's not worth your time, don't do it, games are meant to be fun.
---
&gt; Selectively quoting me does counter my point. 
---
&gt; I preordered this game without question because I’m a Fallout fan. I knew the bugs would be there 
---
I did as well, getting the ID netcode into the Creation engine so I could play Fallout and introduce my son to Fallout and explore the world with him. Was worth the teething pains as BGS got their feet under them. Just getting it to be multiplayer was a hell of a feat.
---
I knew it would be rough day one, but I knew they would eventually get to a point where they pump content into the game like they do ESO. 
---
By the middle of summer I expect the game to be in an absolute great place, with mutliple different modes and an initial set of raids.
---
Eventually will NPCs show up and things will get even more interesting. Hopefully more fun/goofy events like FastNach.
---
The towns will get gradually filled in like they did for the Brewery quests.
---
The haters will sit on the side and eventually be proven wrong, but even better, they have self selected themselves out of the fan base.
---
Ha this is great!
---
I didn't take it that way, and it's valid information for someone that doesn't know that.
---
cya nerd
---
I clicked to play it because I was hoping it would be more like Rust. Anyone can attack you, but you aren't marked for death just because you've been alive for a long time minding your own business.
---
They suck.
---
lol this made me laugh . take my upvote you filthy bastard
---
Wood armour? With those three items? Bottles WOULD be easier... but.. considering it's a Post-apoc setting...  I imagine creativity and ingenuity have to come into play.
---
Bloodied HW builds don’t really use VATS, so you don’t need Unyielding. What they do use is Emergency Protocols torso mod (50% damage reduction) and depending on preference, possibly Serendipity as well (45% avoidance below 30% health). 
---
Very tanky. 
---
Bloodied rifle builds USUALLY are stealth/vats builds because it just works better. 
---
Bloodied melee builds... well, Blocker helps a ton with melee-range survival. 
---
Yeah, I will next time. But in this case, it wouldn't have helped. I crashed to desktop and by the time I got back in, she would've been dead anyway. It was the absolute worst thing that could happen at the worst possible time. Oh well, it was still fun but frustrating at the same time.
---
Lmao, why should bethesda unban a cheater? Please, answer that.
---
Cool flex, but then why doesn’t that apply to any of the magnification scopes? ;)
---
the reflex dot should at least be visible even if it’s just a transparent out line of the reticule.
---
i got banned on a five m server .for posting a video showcasing bugs in their server .  its different
---
I understand *why* they did it.  The daily/weekly intoxicated challenges encouraged players to use the new brewing workbenches.  However, I've been sick of them myself for a while now.  I still get my quests from Biv, but I don't even bother doing the daily ones now
---
I dont see how that helps though. It's like "reset and lose everything or lose 400+ caps everytime you die"
---
Excellent point, yes indeed. 
---
No you didn’t but you are whining on the subreddit when nobody here really cares, complain publicly get public answers. Simple. And I’m not crying I think it’s hilarious that people exploit the game and then complain about being banned for it. Also here’s another surprise you ready? ... BETHESDA DOSENT CARE IF YOU GO TO ANOTHER COMPANY! Lmaoooo. They have millions of players on their games and you think some person they banned for exploiting leaving means anything to them?
---
I mean sure, it's glorifying and making light of addiction and self destructive behavior... But they also make light of dropping nuclear bombs. This is a series that has always combined light heated humor with extremely dark subject matter; violence, drugs, etc.
---
They care about their customers, they just don't care about you, fortunately I share that opinion with them..
---
Yeah, all the camo PA paints are the same “template” (camo pattern), just different colors. And Woodland Warrior is definitely dark. Black/DARK brown/DARK green. Can look just mottled black depending on lighting 
---
Every time I find Graham, he has the fusion generator plan for a very reasonable price...
---
I dont like PVP, so although I have taken Posiedon in the past, I generally farm the PA spawn sites for cores.  
---
Remember, cores are 3# each.  
---
The batteries included perk + the ammo weight reduction perk drops that to 0.3#
---
My camp at Aaronholt Homestead got moved for the same reason, so probably something new coming there too.
---
It's simple. Don't cheat, don't get banned.
---
You should already know this, since you've been banned in other games.
---
I might have an extra violet, I'd have to log on to look. If I have an extra you can have it. 
---
lol millions .....MILLIONS!!!!! sir. dont make me laugh 
---
Awesome thanks., IGN is same as here
---
I know where that's at. Never thought of it being rare. Will have to go back and grab it.
---
Subtitle scaling and in-game "sound subtitles" with a direction indicator (see [Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Subtitles)) would be really perfect as well.
---
This is what happens when you pick up the plans that let you make lanterns.
---
Did you read what this guy said before you responded? Lol he wants slap damage put in survival mode xD bahhaha
---
Three but it varies what ammo I have tons of but generally sniper rifle, combat rifle and sword of baset 
---
do they work in photomode or are those screenshots?
---
.... have you ever been in a nuke zone? It’s big, and if you are there when it goes off it’s instant death. I’m not sure what you’re looking for when you say “more lethal”. What’s more lethal than instant death?
---
And relative to the size of the game world, it is big. 
---
If you’re on PC, I’ll stop by and build you a tent. No foundations needed, but it’ll fit a bed and keep the rain off
---
I will add you when I get online. That æ is a real bitch for most foreigners :-P
---
Sounds like you have a busy fallout life, mate :)
---
Been playing single player fallout since the original dropped.  It's nice to hang out with friends on it for a change.  This game can be a bit of a mess at times, but it's still fun. 
---
You know what I dont really have any problem with reading my notes myself but I totally understand where you are coming from and want more people to experience the fun in this game no matter what. Have some gold for the great suggestion!
---
You know that Bethesda has released many amazing titles in the past that still have tons of players right? It’s not some little game company that’s just starting. 
---
It's ***amazing*** that you keep getting banned from games and not once has it been your fault.
---
Maybe the game companies just have it out for you.
---
Or maybe you're just a lying cheater...
---
Where in the post is that implied? Nowhere did they say "I made a super sledge it only exists in this one game"
---
Bear Arms, rank 3. I carry a virtual arsenal of death. Lol
---
I love how you want a crappy idea to happen.
---
this is the true entrepreneur spirit of a fallout merchant!  i agree we can make some good caps if just undersell the merchants a bit
---
You know that tons of innocent people were banned right? 
---
How about a skin that turns it into the Doom super shotgun?
---
Zoom feature I understand.  My issue is more about the coloring of the note paper against the text.  We need an option to view the text separately from the page, like in green(pip-boy) colored text over a dark background overlay.
---
Beyond this, there also needs to be some colorblind solutions as well.  I've noted it before, but i'll say it again, the magnifying lens in the container menus is effectively invisible when the item is the currently selected one(so it has the yellow background).  I mean, do just 10 minutes of research and you can easily find a list of colors to NOT use with other colors, like Red-Green, Green-Brown, Yellow-White, Green-Yellow.  Essentially don't ever use contrasting colors next to each other without providing a border around the images to separate them.
---
Yeah but bloodied heavy weapons can't one-shot stuff.
---
Bloodied rifles usually use stealth 
---
Bloodied melee are melee.
---
So why use bloodied rifles, considering that you need to be stealthy when you can just use whatever rifle and be loud as fuck? (it's actually a sin to suppress the sound of a 50cal hunting rifle) 
---
Which one sounds easier to you? 
---
Both Vats rifles and bloodied rifles are really good builds, my only point is that vats rifles are easier to pull off. Fewer things to worry about. 
---
I did read everything he said yeah, that slap damage remark was a pretty small part of the whole thing. In general, survival DOES need a lot of reworking.
---
Man iv been server hopping for three hours and still have not seen it. I got the bright head lamp and targeting hud but havent found the jet pack yet. Kinda stupid honestly. If you have the armor you should be able to buy all the mods without all the server hopping. 
---
Wouldn't mind if they would let us prestige our perks... Would help clear some extras out
---
Bethesda never confirmed proof of the people they banned. Many people were innocent and there are youtibr videos showing it.
---
That is part of a quest. Go to the Clarksburg Shooting Club and talk to the range master to start the quest.
---
Mods, can you please ban this moron for encouraging people to circumvent bans.
---
ah well then when player vending comes out, ill have to hock mine then
---
This needs more traction.
---
I wouldn't know about that, I don't use long scopes. Obviously you should be able to look through the scope but the reticle should be invisible like iron sights or reflex imo. 
---
A little bit of consistency would help when it comes to chameleon builds. Maybe there can be new scope mod that allows certain pieces of it to be visible under stealth via a reverse engineered Stealth Boy Mk.III or Chinese Stealth suit
---
Do you still have it?
---
Your bathroom story reminded me of my first encounter in survival. I was level 12 and walking towards a train station when I see a lvl 6 come towards me so I hid ebehind a staircase and wait. He starts looking for me but cant find me, and after a while I sneak out and I see him inside the station. He sees me and sneaks to the bathroom and closes the door to hide which I obviously see. I walk up to the door, open it to see him sitting on the toilet cowering with no weapon drawn. I throw a grenade into the bathroom, closed the door gently and walked to the vendor to sell while he blew up.
---
lol a SERVER on 5m is NOT in ANYWAY a gaming company . its a individual with money to open thier own server .NOT a gaming company . so im just going to assume you are fking retarted 
---
Funny how many people say this when Bethesda never showed any proof or evidence against the people they banned. 
---
r/EntitledPeople/
---
Look, another cheater.
---
I just checked Watonga, there are plans for a lot of the different armors, just not x-01. Even when you buy a mod, it will tell you what it would cost to craft when you go to install it, you just don't need to pay the crafting cost to install the mod. There are still no plans for X-01 mods. You have to buy the mods from the Enclave.
---
Are you okay little guy?
---
Holy shit
---
Hell, if you're alone on the server take 'em all!
---
Defend events might get a bit overwhelming...
---
I'm not banned.... look another Bethesda apologist. 
---
Stacks of flux you say? Are you on ps4?
---
Heavy weapons have had durability wear adjusted. They fire slower though and do a bit more damage.
---
Prime example; my level 6 character being online for 1 hour and suddenly wondering why all these level 100+ characters are in Flatwoods.
---
Exactly this, players were banned for a reason.
---
Honestly, if you can push your damage up high enough, Instigating will put you in 1-shot range on most mobs with headshots (IE vats build.) even on a Bloodied build, if you only take 1 bullet to kill, Instigating is better than bloodied (In PVE. Anytime your target isn’t at max health, Instigating is worthless). 
---
Bloodied builds with bloodied weapons are nice though, because typically you’re in oneshot range even with a bloody weapon, and it works just as well on SB/queen as it does on trash mobs.
---
My preference is a bloody lever action for the 1-hit capability combined with a decent fire rate; I’d try a bloody Handmade if I could find one. If it’s also doing 1-hit kills, it’s faster fire rate and much larger magazine would make it king. 
---
It might not be at all. Me being a 500 hours guy doesn't mean I seen everything. I wrote it here to see if it has any collectibe value.

&gt;Im using a Bloodied Explosive Vats cost reduction Gauss rifle, and I can do 1400 damage on paper.
---
nice build, how many caps was it, or did you just find it on an enemy as one of the "on paper" million possible legendary weapons? Surviving is nothing about survival skills and about which pwning gun you found and abuse. If you can only hang because you can 1 shot in vats, does that make you better?
---
Fallout 4 alone sold 1.2 million copies on Steam in its first 24 hours of release. The game also sold more digital than physical copies on day one of launch.
---
This guy probably know Fallout 76, Fallout 4 , and Skyrim as the only Bethesda games.
---
Hell, Shyrim ***still*** charts millions of players on Steam monthly, and that game is 8 years old.
---
holy crap im sorry that happened to you geez
---
That’s fantastic to hear, thank you
---
Haha your bad 
---
Yeah I stopped doing them. Coming from a family with a few alcoholics in it I don't feel like this should be the center of things anymore. When it first came out, okay. Now, at least have one drunk or alcohol related one and then the rest normal kill so many super mutants while wearing a party hat kind of stuff.
---
im good tyrone 
---
the zone yes, but the shock wave is a joke 
---
I'm sick and tired of these challenges myself. Level up 1 time a day? Not too difficult. Level up **5** times while drunk and wearing a beer hat in one day? Now ***YOU*** must be drunk BGS if you think anyone over level 50 can feasibly even meet that requirement without making a new character all together.
---
I honestly have no clue then because they killed me I even have a video to prove it.
---
Super busy I have no time to farm people because I have to build an organisation that will be able to farm all other organisations.
---
Wait... you want sneaking to be removed? So just do away with that entire mechanic and all builds related? What???
---
Your tears make me smile. No matter what you say we will continue to laugh as you all squirm in the pure butthurt that you have caused yourself. Making a post on here looking for sympathy is pretty dumb on your part. You can make all the "sucking off bethesda" comments you want. Your tears make my lucky charms taste like winning. 
---
Cry for me little one... Cry for me some more😈🤣
---
I missed the rule for "no bethesda apologists"
---
Those are in Artkos Pharma. Not sure what they are for. Guessing it is a quest of some type. In thr room next to them there's processing bins like those in Mama Dolces. Guess I will have to poke around there and see if I can trigger a quest.
---
Or like they have in resident evil where it just shows the words typed when you press a button
---
"Driving their customer base away"... 
---
dude, you know they have the info at their fingertips, right? At any point, at any given second, they can see how many folks are playing, how many new installs, how many uninstalls...

if banning cheaters was hitting them in the wallet, they'd give a shit.

Hi! Yesterday, we briefly took this bundle offline to address the issue that caused the Tactical Pump Action Shotgun paint to go missing after being purchased. Anyone who buys this bundle going forward should correctly receive all the items it contains.
---
Additionally, we added the missing shotgun skin to all players who had purchased this bundle prior to our fix going live. If you bought this bundle and didn't have the shotgun skin, please check again. You should have it now.
---
It doesn't break any of the sub rules soooo.... nope.
---
SALTTTTTT oh the SALLLLLTT
---
I'll definitely have to check this out, been off a couple of nights and last time I was on, I was chasing around an alcohol quest and never went to Watoga. Must have just came with the last update.  If so that will make it much easier for everyone.  I was always lucky for the jetpack mod, but it took me 130+ levels of searching and hopping before I got lucky for the calibrated shocks and got 2 within a couple of hrs. and I wouldn't wish that search on anyone.  I assume you are talking about the Watoga train station vendor of course.  I would help you out with the pack, but I'm XBox.
---
You talking about the Scorched-killer mods? I haven’t tested that personally, but the Zealots legendary effect works on SB (I cant personally verify in game if it works on the queen, she just has too much damn health).
---
I have personally done comparison testing of the Zealots legendary on regular SB, it works. 
---
One .308 sniper rifle, and 2 to 4 Super Sledge hammers.  I use the sniper when the enemies are at range, and switch to the super sledges as they get closer.  I carry 2 to 4 sledges because they tend to break quickly, but that will get better as I work on the Makeshift Warrior perk.
---
yeah adventure mode with no slap damage and removal of base destruciton by other players is almost finally the FO co-op we all wanted

[The nukes in the Fallout universe were way way smaller than the nukes in ours. ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuclear_weapons)

I want to see which wait they are. Atleast with mine 20perception character. It is not even fun to shoot on someone who is running in circles because he can't figure out your (campers) location. 
---
Sneaking is great mechanics, but not fun when people just camp.
---
I also intend to do comparison testing with Hunters weapons against SB to see if that RUMOR has any truth behind it. Just bought the weapon, just need the time. 
---
Can't tell if your serious, your literally asking to remove the whole reason to sneak...
---
A better solution would be to make an anti-stealth boy that jams all cloaks within a certain area. 
---
Don't just complain, offer a solution or else your just whining. 
---
No witchhunting
---
Switch to third person, take the tiniest corner of a post-it note, stick it on the dot, switch back to first person.
---
Jesus chill out and read my fucking post. I agreed with you before you went on this rant. All I said was that bloodied is still a good legendary effect at higher amounts of hp. People who run bloodied and leave "paper bags" run at below 20% hp in order to use nerd rage and get close to maximum damage bonus. 
---
&gt;For example on WoW,
---
On WoW, you aren't given a benefit for playing on the PvP servers.  In FO76, you do get some very large benefits.
---
The leaderboard mechanic is the "cost" of those benefits, so that you will occasionally have to fight someone and risk losing some caps and items.
---
zealot works on SB, I can’t verify on the queen but there’s no reason it would be the same as regular SB
---
I know a number of people that have given up on FO76 altogether (that were huge fans of the series).  Almost to the person, the reason they give for not even trying is...micro-transactions.
---
OK, I'm fine with not liking a AAA game asking for more cash to get perks (and I'm rabidly against pay-to-win), but to completely abandon a franchise over cosmetics?  Yeah, I don't really follow.
---
You can argue the cost of the stuff, but if you're against paying extra and won't spend the money no matter what, who cares if a paint job costs 10c or $10.
---
A few people just don't want to play it if it's multi-player, which I can kinda understand, but they're a pretty small number and I think they'll crack once things get running smoothly.
---
Put a ticket in too see if she can be resurrected
---
Zealot works on SB, I can’t verify on the queen but there’s no reason it would be the same as regular SB
---
Fast travel and come back or change servers. Is a glitch.
---
it must hit em in the wallet or they wouldnt promise an unban. im just done waiting on a AAA company to GET THEIR SHIT TOGETHER. THey are already being sued right now for stealing the name "REDFALL" and if there were so many players they would have released the numbers in our face. instead of somone having to dig to find the numbers.look it up. you think they arnt hurting in the wallet? how about the fact they JUST DECIDED to release 76 on steam . cause thier sales suck 
---
If you're on PC I'll sell you some. Have over 800 filling up my stash that I can bear to just drop.
---
I actually know this guy he posts in my FB group all the time, think they are called Essex Corp. Funny story I read this post yesterday where he was describing doing this event and invited me awesome that you actually went! 
---
That's what sneak is... camping until the right moment. This would make sneaking completely worthless. It wouldn't even be sneaking.
---
Im not lying I swear I didn't hit this guy (the other 2 where pre survival update) I have a video as proof I will edit my original post tomorrow morning (Its currently 2am for me) and put a link to the video
---
I don't know what *you* think withchunting is, but by this conversation I do know that your definition is wrong.
---
"Your tears make my lucky charms taste like winning" whatever youve been smoking . you should stop 
---
Changing anything regarding levels is not going to alter the current "player farming" meta.  The root cause of most issues reported thus far has to do with Bethesda incentivizing deathmatch farming.
---
* Reduce the max caps lost/gained to 50
---
* Increase the spawn/fast travel invincibility timer
---
* Stop displaying the positions of the leader board top 3 (and maybe change the default displayed metric from time alive to kills)
---
If they made those changes we would have the Survival mode that most thought this would be when it was announced.  You'd still have the tension of knowing any chance encounters with players could be deadly; but the incentives to actively hunt and farm other players would be removed.
---
Build a 2nd staircase and connect everything together, remove the offending 1st stairway and pieces, and then (**most importantly**) remove the newly added pieces in exact opposite order of how you placed them. This has worked since the very beginning, and still works.
---
Nope.  Clean shaven, kid.
---
(and still playing Fallout 76)
---
I couldn't stay online last night for longer than 30 seconds at a time before crashing to desktop.  5 times in about 10 minutes with a hard reset for 1 time was enough for me to pack it in for the night. 
---
Not a common item. So I would say rare until they start cropping up everywhere. Funny I just ran across that yesterday in an area I haven't visited for 50 lvl's.
---
the game is already paid for . you technically not allowed to sell your copy . id rather buy a bought copy then give  them another 30 . so my point still stands 
---
yup changed servers all good now
---
You don't need to. People solve the code and post it online.  Nukacrypt is where it's at. 
---
My solution is to show direction on compas, you still dont see icon over head so sneak is worth using, but you also know to which directio hide and then push.
---
Why should they? 
---
Just to add to this, if op wants to farm those ghouls, keep the jukebox repaired but don't switch it on. Ghouls will attack it for the full duration of the event, and it can be switched on to complete the event with a few minutes remaining.
---
Dunno about BEST but I got a Quad Broadsider the other day I am DYING to test out! lol
---
Yeah it depends on the weapon. Some are 15/25/35/45 levels, some are 10/20/30/40/50
---
oh im sorry . did i make you go shave?

Last night the entire server went to attack the queen. She landed and froze for Bout 5 minutes. We went making great damage. She flew away and poof gone. Also I had no audio at some point. The game deff crashed a bit. We looked for the queen for the rest of the fight. She gone. 
---
Nice alt account OP.
---
Post the link.
---
I’ve done the server hopping search at the enclave for a while and was never successful at finding the mod when I had the caps to get it. But no, not the watoga station, the vendor bot at the watoga shopping station has the plans 
---
First 100 levels I used pistols and carried about 6 until I found a 3* furious limb damage pipe pistol and then I pretty much only carried that... then started doing nuke runs and end game stuff so switched to a rifleman and now carrying a 3* TSE handmade, a 2* TSE dragon, and a 1* furious lever.. honestly use the lever the most, use the handmade for mobs and when things get hairy, and the dragon for sneak attacks on behemoths and scortchedbeasts lol I would love an AA vats crit lever 
---
Nah mate I have had the old girl since I was a wee level 30 (it is a level 50 weapon so I couldn't use it at first) I could never part with her. No matter what the price
---
Instigating Dragon and Executioner's Black powder for Wanted Hunting.
---
HELLO BRÖTHER I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT OUR LÖRD AND SÄVÏÖR, LÄMP
---
Near ash heap? You hear screams by Alpine River Cabins but I have never heard of this 
---
Second varying spawn points.  
---
Serendipity doesn’t work in PA.
---
I should stop? Bro you sound like Tiny Tim lmao
---
Please Todd... unban me please, sir. Ill gladly open my mouth big and wide for you sir. Please sir, may i have another? 
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Enjoy your ban. I know we are
---
lol sounds like your whining cause your mad im playing an EA game and your so mad because you like 76 but you know it sucks balls . and your mad you support something that is flawed i get it bro .let it out 
---
Because otherwise they can just ban innocent people whi played for their game??? Seems like a no brainer. Or another example is I could report you for something you didnt do because you killed me in PvP and then you get banned for no reason and there is nothing you can do about it.
---
last night both myself and my teammates kept getting "you have reached maximum weight" when trying to pick up stuff or buy stuff, and we were all under weight... we switched servers and it stopped happening, so as a rule of thumb, if the game is acting weird, try server hopping!
---
usually fixes issues!
---
Go read the rules kiddo.
---
Same. Never even seen a legendary a hunting rifle. 
---
This is a problem in adventure mode also. Not only did Bethesda do absolutely nothing about the Whitespring turret bases......now turret bases are popping up at West Tek and outside of Watoga.
---
The sound of turrets is unbelievably annoying and as a sneak build they destroy my ability to enjoy the game.
---
Every turret base I see brings me closer and closer to using my nephew's level 5 account and handing him an orbital strike to demolish these bases. It would be well worth the 5 caps to demolish their base.
---
I can only imagine how this is being abused in survival mode at spawn locations.
---
If you need me to paint you picture I can. I like how you continually try to paraphrase incorrectly or put words in other people’s mouth. Just state your point...
---
Strategy plays a parts and so does what you are trying to accomplish, such as your goals or your idea of what success is. It all revolves around adrenaline and enjoyment. For many people killing another player may not drive adrenaline and enjoyment as do other aspects of the game. A level 20 vs level 180 can have its own unique adrenaline and enjoyment dynamic without the level 20 killing the 180. This may take the form of surviving longer or out-foxing the higher level player. Whatever form it takes it can be just as enjoyable and skill based or even more skill based than actually killing the higher level player. You can even brag about out-foxing a level 180 because most players will understand the dynamic power difference and the absolute delta between those two players and expect the level 180 to kill the level 20.
---
Trying to nerf a level 180 to make it a fair battle for a level 20 is dumb and would only ruin the game. 
---
Now try using your words to make your point
---
Yes, I've heard that noise by the Cabins. Creepy. Creepy. Creepy.
---
You wanna make a bet about bloody heavies oneshotting stuff? Cause I will happily prove you wrong. My Gatling gun is pushing 500 damage. I don’t use VATS but it’s accurate enough that if I want to, I can usually headshot Supermutants with ADS fire. 
---
And I do best of both, bloody stealth vats rifles. 
---
How dare you show up here with a different opinion!
---
I'm supposed to care that you're playing an EA game?
---
Sooo you want to say that all those TSE weapons you had were all legit? If we played the same amount of time it's pretty much impossible for you or anyone to get so many different TSE weapons.
---
Oh wait, now you're going to say you traded for them. 
---
And from your videos you posted on your youtube channel it seems that you got banned for being a dick to some admin, not showcasing bugs. The ban reason was "racism and harassment".
---
Nope.  Too busy playing Fallout 76.  
---
Lots of neat updates and shit... You should see it.  :D
---
Just place down a fertilizer extractor at your camp, you'll have an instant wife, with a bonus sister-in-law!
---
I'm checking now.
---
Riiight... I'm sure that a company that released a game that was crushed by everyone at launch is very interested in banning their players for kicks and giggles.
---
Panickedsoul - 1, Logic - 0
---
its funny how everyone here WANTS me SO BAD to be asking for an unban . but i never did . therefor all of you look stupid af 
---
Yes, my 4k+ Karma is the guys "alt account". Did your mom eat paint chips while pregnant with you?
---
Sorry, gonna call 'em like I see 'em. The dude, like everyone else who's been banned, is a cheater.
---
I’m not sure what you mean by that. You’re differentiating between the “zone”and the shock wave? 
---
It’s actually speakers on the trees. You can use them to lure creatures to you.
---
My luck I'd get a regular drill. 
---
You know... I noticed that ever since they changed up the vendor Notes selection, I've been unable to find Deep Pocketed. I don't mean just to buy either, I've not even looted one...
---
On my main char (created Dec 4, now lvl 75) I had ended up with the majority of them, but on my second char (lvl 86) I found one or two Deep Pocketed plans early on but seems like about the time of that patch (was lvl30-something) they're both not stocked in vendors **and** not in the drop tables. Granted, there's always the possibility that the vendors that do stock them have always had them purchased by the time I get there... Unless the vendors don't quite work that way and only items other players have sold to the vendor are visible to others, but not the default stocked items *(similar to how the vendor's on-hand Caps amount are specific to our character)*? 
---
well . i hope you feel better man . an nah. im good .game sucks dick 
---
I smash the ones at white springs. If you want I can start smashing the west tek ones too for ya. 🙄
---
[It should be Western Revolver](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Western_revolver_(Fallout_76))
---
if you don't want to constantly PvP your character is cross mode, so just pop out of survival and then pop back in when you wanna shoot people. What point is there doing quests in the PvP mode? a weird risk to just die in the middle to another character and have to redo content? 
---
Don’t worry. Lrn2notcheat.
---
Those cabins also shake n stuff. Would been fun if there would been whole quest for that mystery.
---
I can't right now. I haven't posted the video anywhere yet its still on my playstation and it is currently 2am where I am. In the morning I will edit my original post to contain a link to the video.
---
It does.
---
Still, I'm talking in general, not just for PA users.
---
Did you check the watoga station or the watoga shopping center. Phoenix at the watoga shopping center definitely has them 
---
Bro... You ruined the quest for him :/
---
You think not? Showing that they "banned all the cheaters" brings in more people who impressed with it. 
---
I'm a sneak/sniper build
---
1. Silenced gauss rifle for most things
---
2. Explosive handmade for situations where I lose sneak or get swarmed
---
3. Silenced lever-action for cheap ammo when I don't need as big a hit as the gauss
---
4. Either a pipe rifle or a tesla rifle for trash mobs, depending on which one I have more ammo for.
---
Looking forward to you proving that you could be killed without being flagged for pvp.
---
I checked both. There were plans for almost every other power armor but not X-01
---
Wow, I feel terrible.
---
&gt; I agree with you that you dont need a crazy legendary weapon to one shot things. But you do need a decent build.
---
&gt;However you are making that argument while shooting ghouls that have no DR.
---
You added that bit after i replied to you. 
---
I think I lost two brain cells just reading this
---
then you never watched the video . and who said anything about TSE? wtf lol
---
Know whats really funny. That youre banned lol. Therefore you REALLY look stupid! 
---
Correct, id never been through there before
---
Not really. They used an automated system that bans people for gaining 100,000 items in 30 days which is easy to do legit but will get you banned.
---
Three. A Gatling Plasma largely dedicated to scorchbeast removal, an explosive Gatling Laser for most everything else, and a bloodied Grognak's Axe for melee situations.
---
Dont be :) I think we we're quick enough! 
---
I checked them both the shopping center had mods for all of the T- series armor but not X-01
---
Go to lucky hole mine w/ excavator pa and you can get like 300 ore to smelt to upwards of 500 scrap
---
I do not have an extra. I must have dumped it into a suitcase somewhere to pay it forward.
---
Sorry for the wait, good luck!
---
Except you don't get banned for crafting the items so, yeah, they're cheaters.
---
This post is dumber than the lost one I just read. Don’t cheat
---
Would love to see pistol improvements. I only carry one now to kill low level enemies without wasting shotgun/rifle ammo. 
---
Well...I like to kill thing so...
---
Combat Knife
---
Gauss Sniper rifle
---
Plasma Gatling gun
---
Normal Gatling gun
---
50 BMG
---
40mm auto grenade launcher 
---
I  like big guns and I cannot lie :)
---
Its a little rusty, but ill take it out of storage.
---
Following up on this, in adventure server hopping is working for me but in survival it puts me back in the same two servers over and over.   I tested in unpopulated areas and the stuff I killed was still killed and the guys I blocked (for testing) we're still there and still blocked lol.  It's like there are only two servers or something xD
---
Is their a way that I can invite my nephew's abandoned level 5 character to my game and for him to rack up serious damage without an orbital strike?
---
The only reason I have not done this is because I didn't have any yellow cake flux to make him an orbital strike..... LOL. I have no interest in PvP and I'm a level 215 so it's not worth the caps on my account.
---
He meant alpine cabins. But yeah, no idea what it is huh?
---
It's not a "mystery" really.
---
&gt;!Tehre is a control box nearby that you can use to activate everything!&lt;
---
Im on the east coast. I was just up early today and I figured Id see if someone was done to play 
---
Yeah, but i want only know direction not to see you instantly. There is not icon over your head, till i hit you for first time, so sneak would be still worth it. By your meaning TSE nerf was bad, because now are TSE weapons weak.....
---
I'm guessing your the guy selling these accounts promoting your business 😂
---
I completely understand! Good luck, pal! x
---
As far as camping, you get killed before loading into the only spawn location at train stations lol. 
---
My current character uses a 10mm pistol and Blade of Bastet, with all of my characters I carry an OH SHIT stick (shotgun) for when that random deathclaw/scorchbeast shows up.
---
You probably won't get any kills for a long time. It's also very easy to enter top 3 if you are just doing quests etc and not PvP. So expect Mr lvl 200 to come for you every now and again and try not get too mad about it. 
---
Not true. It doesn't distinguish the difference of where you got the items from. Obtaining 100,000+ items period gets you banned. 
---
Isn't the base damage for a Gatling gun about 70 points?  Really impressive if you can push that damage up to 500
---
Nah.  Game's worth the $60 you wasted.
---
It's ok to be mad.
---
Yeah!  And also, let's get rid of Chameleon!  And also, I want to have a direction and distance marker for all players!!
---
lol how i have not find that. I remember exploring that area for hours 
---
You really think he’s gonna get a good response calling a game shit on that games subreddit?
---
I think not. I sincerely think not. Because common sense and logic tell me otherwise.
---
Sorry that you are not guided by those principles.
---
\[spoiler\]If you do some searching around the area, you can find a hidden treehouse with a terminal inside with options to trigger the spooky stuff. Turns out it's all technical trickery done by someone to scare visitors.\[/spoiler\] 
---
what happened here lol
---
haha are you me? I did the same and found the last scorched just in time (I used Nuka shine, I was just about to ~~teleport~~ black out when I killed the last scorched
---
They have to be starred legendaries,  not just regular legendary ones.
---
That’s ridiculous, people aren’t banned for no reason. They certainly don’t owe you any explanation when you know full well why you were banned, you’d just be wasting their time. 
---
They have to be starred, although I think I had a couple non starred crown ones count....I didn’t think to hit record and go back and look.  But I know for sure that starred count and non starred don’t.
---
I was on a server that has uranium fever three times over a two hour span, so I was able to knock out nine really quickly.
---
I have no idea why that is bolded. I'm on a cell.
---
These are all with maxed perks for a rifle build, and at 19% health.
---
BE Lever action - 600 base damage ps
---
BE handmade (semi auto) - 368 base dmg ps
---
B   Combat - 318 base dmg ps
---
B   Hunting - 348 base dmg ps
---
BE Black powder rifle - 1046 base damage
---
The best part with a bloodied build is, even a base STR of 4, and no melee perks, I can pick up a bloodied melee and do 200+ dmg with it.
---
I have a lvl 35 bloodied fiery pitchfork that does 199+19 dmg I use for trash mobs, and a bloodied ski sword that does 204 dmg.
---
Sadly, it was probably everyone loading in a new area at the same time that crashed the server.
---
TSE is totally different, that's just a damage nerf. The entire point of sneaking is so that the other person does NOT know where you are. This would just eliminate sneak entirely which is why it will never happen. 
---
You have videos of you using TSE weapons.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plD4HZKrMO4
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S3G2ynrJu4
---
I'm sure you remember them, you posted them yourself. How do i know they're TSE? Well the prefix is there "two-shot" and it shows up when you use your weapons wheel. I also know they're explosive because the bullets explode on impact.
---
yep good plan
---
Shhh, nothing happened. Now move along xD
---
Plans? For X-01? 
---
I was just there last night and while he has a ton of PA plans, he only has up to T-51...
---
I thought there were no X-01 plans either. Gonna need picture proof of this one
---
Hahah oh man. What a cool idea :)
---
We'd probably just get hunted by people with AA sniper weapons.
---
I grabbed a 3\* Nocturnal Cryolator off her last night.
---
Gee.... thanks LOL
---
I’ve killed multiple 3 star Legendaries and it still says 0/25
---
Legally Blind players here, I totally agree. The stories in Fallout are probably my favorite part of the game but in 76 I can only use Holotapes and Terminals to get my fix because handwritten notes are just beyond what my eyes are capable of. (I could read most notes in Fallout 4 with some effort).
---
Also I posted about a feature that highlights corpses to make them easier to find on week one of F76 release. A dev said it was a great idea they’d look into but months later I’m still walking back and forth in patterns to try to find corpses and leaving a lot of loot behind when I have to give up from eye strain.
---
Love you Bethesda, could you help a mate out?
---
So you dont actually have any points then? Just saying "common since" over and over? Nice
---
I’ll message you a screencap later tonight with X-01 plans. All I’ve done for hundreds of hours is RP a plans merchant. I know I’ve seen these a bunch cause I check every vendors inventory every single day. But now I feel like I’m going crazy, so let me just check this evening and I’ll replay with a screencap. You may have to server hop, but usually at least some X-01 plans show up 
---
I’ve played with it a little and I will say: very yes.
---
Almost every non-launcher heavy weapon got durability and damage buffed. And buffed enough to matter. There are, of course, outliers that the big B missed. Highlights of that is literally every single launcher weapon(I saw this one coming), the Gatling Laser’s charging barrels mod, flamethrower still is impossible to keep fueled as ammo costs are still stupid, and a lot of heavy weapons still don’t have mods or many of them.
---
Positive highlights: The LMG is great damage now. Gatling Plasmas are extremely durable, I blew through 10 cores and still didn’t break mine. 
---
Energy weapons got improved durability and a slight damage buff. I don’t have perks for them though so I am unsure if this makes them good for those riflemen and commandos out there.
---
Yea. I wonder if he does this over and over on different servers. Watching the world burn. His gamer tag had “666satan” in it. Wouldn’t be surprised. 
---
The balancing of the PvP makes RP difficult and this makes me sad, I’ll see a brotherhood patrol one day if it’s in survival or adventure 
---
I did.
---
She can not.
---
I see it as an opportunity to experience everything again, maybe even try keep it survival!
---
For not sneaking i have direction for very very long distance i know which way i should cover. But sneaky snipers just sit at trainstation like nubs.
---
I am all for microtransactions in the context of how Bethesda has done it - cosmetics! and I have used real money. my issue with it is the cost. it's too expensive. and if those atom shop purchases are the only way I can get variety to build this my only avenue to fresh content I just stopped playing. but I don't want to.
---
I noticed that as well a couple days ago, but on the previous patch (v1.1.0.8, aka exe v1.1.0.7).  
---
Friend and I were trying to trade but the trade window kept vanishing. I thought it was her, she thought it was me. Ultimately just went to a secluded place and used a container.
---
Since I had a whole load of plans I was offering to give her, I figured trade would be easier since she could just take the ones she didn't already know. So I was marking all the ones 0-Caps that I was OK with her taking, and usually I was able to get at least 2 of them set to 0 before the window would \*poof\*. Figured I'd mention this in case it had something to do with setting the pricing, or specifically to setting it at 0. 
---
**SUGGESTION:** I think setting it to 0 should not display 0, but display "FREE". Also making the "Amount" slider pop-ups (in every interface menu; containers, pip-boy, trade, etc) be adjustable by A and D on keyboard \[PC\], and I guess the D-Pad or Analog (Joy) stick on controllers \[PC, Consoles\].   
---
*(Quite certain that it was setup this way in FO4, and I miss a number of QoL things that are missing from 76)*
---
I had a dry spell on one of my toons; for a few days I could not get any dailies other than the ones in Toxic Valley to trigger.
---
Then I did a daily I had never done before in The Forest and the following day I could do dailies again.
---
Still don't have a clue whether those two events are related in any way or not but hey, I can do dailies.
---
Well, except Cop a Squatter which for some reason never completes.
---
Is all part of the charm I guess.
---
The train would wipe out your camp 
---
I'm not banned bunnies they do. You are saying they should just be able to deny anyone they want a service they were paid for without explanation. That's like if all the sudden the electric company said you dont get power any more even though you paid for it and no we dont have to tell you why.
---
i just carry whatever i have the most ammo for now :p
---
He’s so cute
---
Will definitely double check tonight, but I’m positive he has them. They were around 5900 caps, went down to like 5700 after upping my charisma a bit, but still only had 5100 caps so I didn’t get them. But I saw them. Will triple check tonight and post a picture. 
---
Western Revolver. Reloads like a .44, best damage of all revolvers. Looks pretty neat too.
---
Oh nice. It was a pretty sweet idea. 
---
I know how everyone loves the daily alcoholic quests right now. /s
---
Maybe Bethesda should make a quest where you have to run home without fast traveling after blacking our. 
---
I think I was there with you bud. It was my first Queen fight as well. I wasn’t really contributing much as I don’t have much ammo, but I was there. 
---
Is OP a 15 year old still making ***MLG!!!!*** style videos?
---
See that's why I'm hoping someone posts their experience with these mods. If Zealots works with SBs, it would make sense that anti-scorched mods would also have an impact. Although, this is Besthesda, so you never know without testing.
---
About that. That’s kind of the point though- that’s about the same base damage as a hunting rifle. 
---
The thing most people don’t realize did a lot of the % damage buffs are multiplicative, not additive. So with 9/9 heavy gunner, you’re doing 160% damage. Then Bloodied is 1.6 x 160%. Then Adrenal is 1.6 times that result. Then Nerd Rage is 1.2 times that result. Then Bloody Mess is 1.15 times that result. It stacks up fast. If only the new brews worked with heavy weapons (from what I’ve heard Ballistic Bock and High Voltage Hefe don’t work on heavy weapons)
---
I think MrMattyPlays tested it too, but he was salty and only did it like once
---
You're supposed to have alternate characters, pretty easy to level up 2-5
---
Then don’t pay for them? (That sounded like I was being sort, wasn’t meant that way lol) I agree they are expensive but personally I really don’t mind spending on them.  Already spent real money on 4 of the pa skins lol.
---
That would be great. I only have hunter armor at this point (level 71) , didn't know that weapons could drop with that affix as well.
---
Was just going to suggest this.  \*thumbs up\*  :)
---
Every time I kill a 3* enemy I get a 1* item I’ve only ever once gotten a 3* item from a 3* enemy and I’m almost level 70
---
&gt; id rather buy a bought copy then give them another 30
---
Why would you want to give them another 30 after buying another bought copy?
---
Funny thing, I posted this right before logging on and voila! first stop at Watoga shopping plaza. 
---
Thanks for all the input though!
---
Thanks, I was so used to getting my X-01 mods from the Enclave bunker, I had stopped scrolling the whole list for PA parts at Watoga, so I was just missing it. Besides, you wouldn't normally associate the Brotherhood of Steel vendor as having plans for armor you got through the Enclave quest line.  Anyway, thanks again for the info.  Learn something new everyday!
---
I think you have to factor in free atoms in there. It's not just $1 per 100 atoms, because ideally you are purchasing atoms to supplement free atoms earned in game. 
---
Carry berry mentats, or don't stand around with a target on your back
---
Message me if you ready to move on with the process. 👍
---
Lol a second ago you wanted to be unbanned and now “game sucks dick” get out of here man :)
---
I dislike the "level up three/five times" challenges no matter what's attached to them.
---
The alcohol challenges I don't mind, since I'm still working on unlocking all the alcohol recipes anyway. I like trying to locate all the different varieties for some of them.
---
Awesome indeed wow, shame i'm on pc 
---
I had a squad for a bit but the community imploded, so for now I secure technical data as a lone Brother.
---
I killed multiple 3 star Legendaries and my challenge still says 0/25
---
+F
---
Can't bullet time in multiplayer. Aiming still sucks in this engine though, so they left the concept in. 
---
Yes. Or have like "Make it to this location to clear your bounty". The whole bounty system is death sentence. It is nice, but as soon as you get, it is easier just stand in train station and wait someone to kill you. There is no point like trying to fight back.
---
Yeah I did uranium fever twice and awol armaments and none of them which I know for a fact were starred counted.
---
Usually a server kick happens to everyone.
---
OK so I am still not getting any xp but I noticed that when I killed them loot would show for like a split second and then disappear. When I came back to them after a minute or so, the loot was there.
---
A lone knight...Man that makes me kinda sad, factions could have been so much more 
---
"Game sucks dick" that's why you're online bitching about still not being able to play it. Dude, settle down, have a glass of milk and breath. Everything will be alright.
---
The situation with pistols  (and most ranged weapons) makes me wonder if all the devs used melee builds during play testing. 
---
Yeah, I mean It was so out of character for the game it legitimately freaked me out. I chased the sound but found nothing. Wild 
---
I’m sorry but you’re mistaken. There have never been any plans for mods for the X-01. You can only buy the actual mods from the Enclave vendor at the bunker. Any plans you’ve seen at Watoga were for all of the other PAs (except excavator which are found at the vendor in Camden Park).
---
You also don’t need any materials to apply the X-01 mods. Once you buy them, you simply attach them.
---
the game is exactly what was spoken about in the announcement. if you read the interview texts they delivered what they promised. an open world building light survival game with found world quests and no npcs. I freaking fell in love with this game in beta and didn't stop playing until recently. I still want to play this game but when one big is fixed to only introduce another ...ugh.
---
I got extremely frustrated with the building bugs seeming to be zero priority at being fixed. people would showcase a work around on YouTube so they could build then that was patched. so clearly it's very apparent they are paying attention. but the bugs that break systems aren't being fixed. why? it's not even functional in some cases. 
---
I also got frustrated with the only way to spice up camp looks is to buy more atom stuff and yet almost 800 hours played and I'm having to buy atoms with money to pay for that. the atom gain is very slow even if you do daily challenges. I don't mind buying stuff but I do mind feeling ripped off at the prices.
---
and so the game seems to have turned into a grind fest and have limited time items and more expensive than a sub system depending on what you want. so I want to play but it's best I walked away for now.
---
I agree - I think Bethesda missed the boat on their implementation of it.  There are a lot of things I wouldn't mind having, and I have no issue spending a few bucks.  If it was $5 for a great skin, or a buck or two for some nice building sets, I'd probably have pried open my wallet already. 
---
They still can be, providing Bethesda wants to build around them.
---
Just had a white scorchbeast flying past my camp. Turrets and me shot at it and it became red. After it left my camp, semi dead, the turrets started shooting at my own camp. :)
---
I am a melee build, using an instigating switchblade with power move bonuses, maxed str, gladiator each at 1 (+30%), incisor, martial artist, adrenal reaction, glow sight, radicool.
---
My armor gives addition to all of this.
---
I one shot nearly everything on the board. And I am not done building my perk deck yet. :-)
---
I thought they talked about him in the caverns tour, if I'm not mistaken
---
game seems way way too glitchy and half designed for that to lead to anything but people finding ways to glitch out of the map or be otherwise unreachable if they put big rewards on survival. There is just too many ways to get outside the map or inside objects with exploits, and even without exploits going inside a load zone puts you off any map and you can just stand still and chameleon effect (or physically hide with no map to show you are anything but in that load zone, most large load zones have enough places to be hiding for an hour would stop most attempts to find you) 
---
Rad Ant Ale is pretty good for carrying stuff though. I think that might be my favorite beverage now. I just wish ants were as common as mole rats.
---
&gt;My vision isn't good enough to read the hand-written notes in your games. Please add a zoom/magnification feature.
---
This is a problem that many players have raised in the past. The notes are inconsistent in terms of font size, coloring, and handwriting style. Most of them are simply impossible to read regardless of your visual acuity.   I appreciate that Bethesda took the time to craft a multitude of note styles to give more authenticity to this sort of 'found footage' story revelation... but in terms of UX it's pretty shitty when you cannot actually READ the lore.
---
I personally have similar issues with the default Pipboy interface (the alternative interface is much more readable) and certain Terminal styles.
---
Some of this could be fixed with as simple a solution as just offering up the dialogue in a textual interface off to the side.
---
&gt; . I knew the bugs would be there because I’m a fallout fan. 
---
Exactly!
---
Bethesda games are always buggy at first.  Games where companies try a completely new thing (like an MMO of their single-player franchies) are always buggy at first.  
---
The amount of kvetching over bugs at release was unreasonable.  If you had any awareness of the world around you, you had to know that it would take some time to iron this game out. 
---
PC gamers were especially guilty of this, and they more than anyone should've understood what they were in for.  I say that as someone who owns the game both on console and PC.
---
I hope they get some focus in the future, a complete overhaul would be lovely to have
---
Were there other players around? I was alone for most of mine but I’ve read some other posts where people have reported that you have to get the last hit or something similar. The two times there were other players and both of us hit the 3* mile miners, I got credit, so the normal mechanic of tagging for loot seemed to apply
---
Curious on this as well. Still remember seeing those articles with the ridiculous picture on super market trips with my mom when I was kid.
---
It is left bumper on an xbox. I assume there is something like that on the PS controller...
---
Hey this is kinda fun - nope this game sucks.
---
or give it increased fire rate with stacking DoTs up to a max to increase its damage usefulness. 
---
I was playing with a friend and it was just me and him. We even tested that theory of getting last hit and it still wasn’t registering that I killed any.
---
Take a trip through the Uncanny Caverns to find your answer.
---
They should definitely fix that in game; however, if you still want to listen to the radio drama holotapes (I highly reccomend them, they're actually great) they are all available on YouTube. Just look up the specific name and I believe most if not all of them are on there. 
---
It’s like climbing a ladder to go down a slide. But you get a splinter. But you push thru. And then you get stuck in the slide. 
---
I post this on every disability thread, Bethesda color blind settings would be incredibly helpful as well. Especially in combat with enemies and seeing their color
---
That van hallen replied to me that there was like some sort of box there that could activate all or something and i meant that earlier reply to that. but yeah caused goosebumps at the first time when i came across that area damns.
---
Your title literally says "I'm done waiting for this unban wave" literally translates to wanting to be unbanned. 
---
And deleting both posts 🤣
---
Good thing is you aren’t forced to buy cosmetics for what they’re asking. It’s just cosmetic. 
---
Its always the singleplayer games to me that would make perfect coop games. a coop Skyrim and Fallout 4 in its entirety is a dream ill probably die waiting for. The last game ive played that I have had so much fun with in coop or online was ark.
---
Once you learn  recipe you know it forever 
---
that's what she said
---
Oof well i play on pc, sorry mate
---
Bethesda has stated crafting item does not get you banned. You get banned for having an excessive amount of rare or difficult to obtain items.
---
If you get banned for obtaining 100,000 items I would be banned for crafting 5mm ammo by now.
---
The people that were banned (I apologise for wrongly assuming you had been) were banned for good reasons.  Why should Bethesda have to waste time explaining their decision to someone who has abused and exploited the game with no regard for other players? This isn’t anything like your analogy, it’s more like people complaining that their electricity was cut off because they never payed for it, then demanded an apology and more free electricity. If someone has been banned then they need to accept it and wait for a resolution. Simple.
---
And a side view for vertical boundaries! (Mines tall, orrrr actually just high.)
---
Better question! When can we wear helmets alongside the mask? For real that mask is not covering enough for us to not wear a helmet, please for the love of god let me look complete! 
---
I've avoided the top three with the exception of the first day.   Combat/encounters with others are seemingly easy to find at the usual hot spots, watoga, Wes tek and whitesprings.  I ran I to like 5 players at Wes Tek, all of us over level 150.  Everyone put their guns away, emoted, and we went our separate ways lol.  The top three things just does not fit with that I want to do.  My goals havent changed, I just want more suspense while doing it xD
---
Wow. 
---
Common *sense*, yeah. I understand that you don't use it much, but you should at least know how to spell it.
---
Look, it's simple. You claim that Bethesda is banning players because they feel like it, with no other reason. And the facts say that the *vast majority* of players, who haven't cheated or used exploits, aren't banned.
---
Now, where is your proof?
---
I have 3 long range rifles. And an ax.   I do most of my damage from far away as you can tell haha 
---
https://youtu.be/S0Kd6yvFhpw
---
not a military style base but it is a checkpoint base
---
Cool, meme.  
---
What are you looking for?
---
I guess I was unclear, I meant the drink effect  duration once you brew them. The ones I’ve made so far really don’t last very long
---
Tell us what happened. Lol
---
I would like to know this also
---
No worries thanks anyway!
---
Survival meta is low level. Go farm low level legendaries and play survival with a decked out level 5 character. With level balancing, low levels have the upper hand by losing less caps upon death. High ass level characters have the highest risk as a level 300 death cost 600 caps. But a level 5 character in full legendary gear/armor only cost 10 caps upon death. Don’t even level up your low level character. Just use him to hunt and kill pvp players
---
Wondering how they think people can acquire 1500 atoms without using real money in 6 days? With the current daily and weekly challenges  and many normal challenges just straight up being bugged (for example a few of the discover locations just won’t actually take into account the locations you’ve discovered) 
---
It should be something like 2$ for 500 atoms 5$ for 1500. Honestly I think a lot of games have their prices too high to the point where I'm not even going to buy anything.
---
Glad to see I’m not the only one with this issue. I only wear glasses when I drive and play video games. Like someone else said, I also have a 65” 4K HDTV with a XB1X and sit about 8 feet away from my tv and I struggle to read some of those notes and even the bottom text of the perk cards that are along the bottom row. 
---
No suppressors, and the bright, direct line of light from your gun might be a giveaway to your position.
---
3 days IRL or 3 days in-game play time?
---
Some timers are based on your in-game playtime, so if you're lot spending a lot of time in game, certain things will seem to take forever to spawn.
---
I don't know about those containers specifically, but I know some loot (both containers and outside) definitely have a timer tied at least partially to your play time.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s not because you can’t get an addicted debuff from over use.
---
Different platforms for purchasing. There is no reason to split servers for the same OS.
---
I'm a sprinting melee character and this change would help me a lot. However IT IS THE DUMBEST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD!
---
I was on a server last night that launched a nuke at fissure prime and we actually managed to take her down. I got a ultracite helmet plan for my troubles. Why are the plans for the ultracite PA still dropping? The plans can be obtained by completing the bos questline which makes these plans worthless, unless I'm missing something?
---
When you’re high level, you basically have $.10 for completing dailies and occasionally one of the $.40 cumulatives that you’ve been working towards for nearly 6 months now 
---
I know what I saw, but I know no one will believe me unless I show proof. So I’ll follow up about this later. I know what everyone’s saying, but I know what I saw and have occasionally seen for a while now. I wouldn’t save caps for days to work towards something I wasn’t sure is actually even in the game. 
---
#commencinghissyfit!
---
Hence why I made a thread describing why I wouldn’t be paying what they’re asking
---
I gotta make sure to swing by tomorrow.  Should we check our weapons along with our coats?
---
I could see $10 = 1500 being a fair middle ground
---
Yeah Woodland Warrior is just a darker M81 Woodland Camo. I've been lighting up Bethesda's suggestion box for the better part of this year because the other one was just a little too bright for my tastes. Of course they put the first one on sale a day before the second one so I got fooled into buying both. Todd giveth and Todd taketh.
---
As you could’ve concluded from the post, I did not pay for them
---
Well it doesn’t matter too much if you have someone to transfer it between characters.
---
3 ways
---
1st way
---
Steps 
---
1. Max the weapon of choice damage cards
---
2. Max sneak and all the dam x sneak card
---
3. Max bloody mess and explosive perk
---
3. Instigating weapon Preferably with explosive 
---
4. Profit
---
2nd way 
---
2. Max vats dam crit cards
---
4. Instigating weapon preferably explosive or vats crit
---
5. Enter vats profit
---
3rd way
---
1. Max weapon of choice card
---
2 stay at low health with rads
---
3 pick low health dam perk and get adrenaline reaction mutation 
---
4. Bloodied weapon preferably with explosive second mod
---
5. Profit
---
If you mix the bloody build with the first two it gets catty powerful 
---
MY MINIGUN NEEDS TO EAT!
---
I've not played Survival, but this seems like a good mechanic to deploy. At LEAST until players reach, say, level 60. (I think by lvl 50 we're still kinda learning and configuring out Perk build-out, so that 10-level buffer would give time to apply those levels to shift things around.)
---
After lvl 60, it's open-season on PVP and a lvl 250 can take out a lvl 66 and get the full reward.
---
However, it feels like perhaps there needs to be some more balance applied beyond just that... Such as:  
---
\- &gt; lvl 60, business as usual  
---
\- &lt; lvl 60, killing players more than 10-levels lower results in no reward  
---
\- &lt; lvl 25, 5-levels lower = no reward  
---
\- lvl 1-10 only caps and XP rewarded, as these kills do not drop any AID items at all (or maybe just everything except Stims?)
---
Conversely, if a low level picks a fight with a high level that would otherwise be outside that range, then "all bets are off" and if the low level dies then the high level gets full reward. If the lowbie instigated it, there's no reason to punish the high level then! lol
---
Yes I know, this really puts a "nanny state" twist on it all, but I feel like this is sort of lore friendly, too... After all, we've come from the same Vault for starters, so the goal ***is*** still to survive as a human species, but it's indeed also about self preservation; survival of the fittest, but since low levels pose no threat, there's little benefit in eliminating them. Right? :P *~~I think the entire idea here was to sort of make thi...~~* Actually, this is an interesting thought I've gotten and deserves its own post!
---
Alcohol doesn't last long, beer is like 2min and spirits/mixes/moonshine are like 4 maybe? Not sure
---
Yeah. They don't care that you're only going to give them 20 caps. They see your name on a list.
---
"Chesty!, Here Boy"
---
Anything at all man, I'm running about with level 15 armor. Without the materials to repair them.
---
Or a Co op (optional) NV like spin off with a return to RPG mechanics
---
Also, nobody has mentioned it yet, but deaf people totally don't benefit from the audio-directional bobblehead, magazine, and cap stash perks either. We need a directional hud indicator or feature for their disabilities as well.
---
Haven't heard that one, and I'm familiar with the Alpone Cabins...but this game has some amazing environmental sounds that seem to trigger based on proximity etc. The satellite dishes by West Tek will creak super loud, the train cars near NAR north of Whitesprings make settling noises. For all the other faults they've really gone to an extent with setting environmental vibes. 
---
Huh? But Fallout 4 has Creation Club, which is arguably "worse" than the Atom Shop, in the sense that you can't earn store credits at all. That's just people grasping at straws, I think. There were way more legitimate concerns about the game in the beginning, but now they're mostly gone.
---
Maybe they're making them hard on purpose so we have to spend money to get what we want 😱
---
Irl time. Maybe Four hours of in-game time or more. These containers and bodies are supposed to reset every 20-24 real world hours to my understanding. Prior to this patch I could run it once a day and it was fully restocked.
---
I don't think I've ever seen anyone suggest that it was going to be FO5 and then was switched. And I'm pretty active on reddit. Especially around E3 times 
---
For someone who is "DONE...", you sure come across as a jilted tween girl.
---
So... be done, then. Go. There's the door. The fact you're here BANGING ON YOUR KEYBOARD IN ALL CAPS sure makes it seem like you're not done, though.
---
Honestly, man. All you dudes screaming for an "unban" or saying you're "DONE" should just go. That'll teach them. It'll shut them down, they'll go out of business, they'll lose so much money they'll be mortgaging their grandchildren's futures just to put food on the table.  
---
So... be done. stop whining about it. Stop yelling about it. Stop talking about it. If you all leave, their data will tell them you've left, and how long they have before they need to commit seppuku.
---
Grow a set. Walk the walk. Stop talking.
---
I could help u move those items
---
XD lol. We ruined the quest and deleted our comments. Not as interesting as it seemed haha. Sorry for the disappointment guys
---
It saves my life on a hourly gameplay basis. In my experience it’s working.
---
You guys are right I think he was near the cabins 
---
I have a melee/tank build. I carry the "All Rise" Super Sledge, an Executioner's Grognak Axe, and a level 45 Somerset Special with a prime receiver to tag  Scorchbeasts while they are in the air and keep their attention.  
---
I was also running an anti armor deathclaw gauntlet but that disappeared. I likely sold it by accident and didn't notice until it was too late.
---
Hi I am online noww do we trade?
---
I just paid 10K for a contractor to build my BoS themed crew an HQ, I'm not familiar enough with Reddit to post them via imgur or what not but I can show you the camp in person if you'd like. 
---
No i mean I've seen plenty of idiots think it would be like NV were it was a fallout 3.5 and not a spinoff that was ment to be completely different 
---
I love it, even though the chemist in me had to turn a blind eye to aluminum being labeled "AL" instead of "Al."
---
&gt;1\* lvl 50 bloodied grognaks axe
---
I am down. sent you a DM.
---
As many hours as I have in FO4, I know little about the creation club other than the name.  For whatever reason, it can be completely ignored by most people (probably because it's not in your face every time you log on or look at the menus).
---
But I agree, that's a pretty lame argument, but some people just get hung up on certain things and won't let go.
---
Not enough accommodations are made for disabled gamers 
---
Well, there is this one house just north east of vault 76 that a person I party up with and I have deemed the “sickle man house”. It’s hard to get up into and has one way in, making it a pretty good place to bait people in and kill them.
---
The problem is that when a PvE'r wants to go roam the map, and just 'survive'....they have a ticking time bomb as to when when the deathmatch will be forced upon them.  I think the hardcore PVP'ers can still have their cake because places like whitesprings are hotbeds, even without the map markers.
---
When I think of survival in an apocalypse, my very first strategy is probably going to be to avoid people and civilization.
---
That being said,  I'm having a kick out of Survival mode right now.  It adds an edge that was missing before, and makes you feel like you have to be alert and on your toes at all times.
---
Good lord. Given the ass-pain associated with gathering some of the ingredients this stuff just ain’t worth the effort.  Grr
---
If you are still on at 6pm central hit me up. Harry Wagstaff is gt
---
3\* Legendary Sammich.... lol
---
Maybe 10 atoms for dailies if youre not even trying, but really if you are trying to grind it out for some cosmetics, you can grind out at least 30 a day and hit maybe 40 a week for about 250 atoms. You can get even more with some extra effort. If you want a particular cosmetic, play for it for a week or two, then maybe spend a few bucks to push you over the edge. 
---
The loot should be available for the Scorchbeast Queen, not every other legendary at White Springs.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
I noticed the same issue all over the map.
---
I had that issue with some cap stashes too.   I played survival for two days straight, no cap stash looting, went on adventure and they were all empty. Gave up and forgot about it lol
---
It honestly helps you level alts rather well. I didnt even try hard in getting my second character to 50. Nice being able to switch builds without spending 20 levels on SPECIAL
---
That’s the primary issue: taking two weeks to get 500 atoms doesn’t help much when a 1500 atom deal is only the store for 3 days
---
I know this will get me downvoted too, but the point of microtransactions is to support the continued development of new content for the game. This "you already paid for it" argument is nonsense. No, you didn't. You paid for the game. You don't buy a base model car and then demand that you get the upgraded stereo because "you already paid for it". If they stop offering microtransactions, they're just going to stop offering this extra content. It's not going to become free. Creating extra content costs money. It also means they can pay for expensive infrastructure costs to keep those servers up for free (I'm old enough to remember when you had to pay monthly fees to play games in persistent universes). This constant whinging about "microtransactions and DLC should be free" is tiresome and delusional.
---
Minigun, gatling laser, plasma gatling, auto grenade launcher, missile launcher, and .50 mg. Sure is gun being a heavy gunner now. 140/260 lbs too. Ordinance, bear arms ftw.
---
Rare items included ultracite ammo sooo.....
---
Ballistic book lasts 5 minutes I think.   Not sure about all but some last longer than others
---
I would also like to know this
---
Wow it just clicked that nukashine is moonshine. Now I feel dumb for not doing those daily's because the only thing I could find with moonshine in the name was cranberry moonshine
---
Also, to be sure, I don’t expect I will get any of it back, but I don’t see the harm in asking them to do the right thing after they screw up... Either it’s a glitch/exploit and a cheater stole my stuff so they should have tested it better than to have launch-hour exploitation or it’s directly their fault, either way the right thing would be to make up for it somehow...
---
Gah, you made me hurry up and log in while at work thinking the Blackbird paint was available again...
---
If a perk card with 3 points on it only procs once an hour, I wouldn't say it works.
---
Idk, the rad resistance is big especially if you're a bloodied melee build. I've got an executioners gamma gun and reactive plates and unarmed bloodied builds are well, less than effective. (yes i'm salty against those guys running around naked with deathclaw gauntlets). It's the bloodied PA Melees I worry about. I'm personally glad the meta is settling the way it is. Honestly I think the PA's biggest downside is how damn loud it is. I can be in Watoga and hear em three blocks over 
---
What you wrote about being on your toes and alter really makes me respect you and your approach. I think that is the way to go about Fallout survival. Happy hunting.
---
Here is the thing. The electric company then tells you that it's because you didn't pay and have paperwork to prove it so that is actually a worse analogy than my own.
---
I think people forget what an absolute Shitshow other Bethesda games have been at launch without patches. 
---
Bethesda has ambitions, which extend beyond their (anyones) capability. They make the game anyway, patch what they can, and move on. 
---
They should write that on the box. If you bought fallout 76 knowing that, you're probably enjoying it. (If you also knew there were no human or ghoul npcs, which I think was a poor design choice, but STILL bought)
---
Oh, I got it.
---
I run open mike set to area and make a general announcement of intent.  
---
Seems to work most of the time.
---
If I don't get anything before then, then I'll send you a message. Think that's 11pm UK time. Cheers man.
---
Check out my build. I prefer semi auto rifles, and like to move fast. Also I do not use power armor. This build has been pretty good for me. I'm probably gonna move 3 strength to agility tho
---
I have 7 or 8 but most are very light. 
---
I have an AA machete, Vampire death claw gauntlet which I use most often. 
---
I have 3 ghoul slayers melee weapons, all weigh less than a pound. One is a pole hook so I can use that in power armor, the others I can not. 
---
I have an instigating handmade which is my main gun, a zealots 10mm and a 2s sniper rifle. 
---
All together I have about 18 pounds of weapons and they all fit any situation I'm in. And I only have to carry 3 ammo types. 
---
Where are some good static spawns for cranberry moonshine? I know the bootleggers shack south of Macs farm. Usually has 1 or 2. Any others?
---
Lol. How am I trolling just because I think you're wrong?
---
If you've played a game more, you should be better skilled and equipped than someone who has played the game less. I don't even understand how that's debatable.
---
Maybe our friends U/ladydevann or U/Valseek can look into it and I'll submit a ticket
---
I am saying they usimg using automated system that can sometimes ban innocent people because they are lazy not "because they feel like it"
---
Ferment \[Drink Name\] for \[Effects\]
---
Would be more descriptive
---
For me the first attack always comes up within a minute after I've captured the workshop. Not sure if it's a bug or if it's supposed to be like that 
---
Which mr 900 hours clearly duped, sooo.....
---
I play fallout not fortnight. That's why there are separate servers now. Every fallout has had vats slow time until now, that's what I meant. 
---
In my experience, no. In the forest thats my missing one too. 
---
You aren't saving your atoms when there isn't anything you want to buy? 
---
Really? That's gonna save a lot of time and headaches
---
How many folks make enough of this stuff to make it an effective tool?  5 minutes of reward for hunting ticks for 20 minutes doesn’t make sense...
---
And why not ? The queen should dump some serious loot I agree, but any legendary enemy you take down should as well. Especially sense there is only a few at white springs now
---
I finished it the day before they dropped brewing. So happy now that I see all these posts that im done.
---
Mine always seem to drop and stay where they explode. That was crazy tho he went flying lol
---
Level 135, 450 hours in and I've gotten 3 3*drops. One was good the rest weren't useful.
---
3* enemies are rare enough to find as it is, their drops should match their stars. No need to increase difficulty if they're already rare, just have the reward worth it  
---
Im 170 and its the same here. Dont feel bad
---
You know lots of folks here complain about having dozens of Atoms but nothing worthwhile to spend it on, right? 
---
LOL only thing with Nuka shine is you gotta get the thing done before you just LEAVE the AREA against your will 
---
Huh, I usually eat the cats I find in Appalachia. Didn't think to tame them.
---
Did you own a workshop at the time? That is the only way unless you struck back. Or accidentally whacked them first early in the tansaction.
---
The timing of these paints coming in right after the first large wave of desirable items (mothman and wild Appalachia content) had me running short after banking the first few months 
---
What type of armor are you using? At your level the magical place for balistic armor is Camp McClintock north of the Charlseton Airport.
---
This is true. I found a level 1 bloodied machete yesterday, got me thinking of finding a nice bloodied ranged weapon and building a vats crit character at as low a level as possible to have most of the necessary perks lol
---
No. Not it has not.
---
Take up golf as a hobby, see if you like how pricey that is
---
4 but mostly just use 1 all the time. 
---
I have 10k atoms from doing daily/weekly challenges since the game launched because I don't think "all that for 10 atoms? no thanks."
---
It's not reset and lose everything. Upon reset, you gain a legendary ability (they haven't explained precisely how this will work yet - but one would think that ability will give you an advantage over other players). 
---
Where? *Everyone* thought that after the first trailer because they didn't say it was multiplayer. Then Schrier leaked that it was multiplayer but some people said he was lying because Bethesda is a perfect company and would never compromise in that way. After E3 (only a week later) all of those thoughts were killed as Bethesda fully revealed what 76 was.
---
It's pretty clear that they didn't want people to know RIGHT off the bat what it was. That's clear from Pete Hines Twitter, the reveal teaser, and the first trailer shown (at Microsofts E3 conference). Dunno how anyone who thought that it was going to be a spin off using the same assets is an idiot as that was the general consensus everywhere lol. 
---
I'm already scared of the day when the four horsemen of the apocalypse Power Armor skins will be up for sale...Hopefully it won't be 1500Atoms/skin
---
If anyone wants to see the skins check this https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asralt/post_patch_6_new_pa_skins_data_mined/
---
I normally just wave and start killing mobs. Afterwards I wave and fast travel away.
---
Today 11am pacific/ 2pm Eastern. 
---
Yeah past few days I don’t know why haven’t dealt with it in weeks 
---
oh, a broken thing in fo76, what a surprise :(
---
Well my challenge had the same progress last I checked on both characters.   I could be misremembering, I can check when I get off work in an hour.  Also I'm 5 legendaries away from completion (20/25) so I can be certain after I complete it
---
The in-game wood armour I mean, where it's just wood chunks strapped to the character that break really easily and provide low resistance
---
This happened to a friend and I probably twice, *maybe* three times. It's indeed very frustrating, but it seems to happen when a player has already spawned on the map and then starts trying to invite others who haven't fully loaded in (are not on the main menu anymore). Then it seems like the server is not properly conveying to each client that an invite HAD been sent, and instead of timing out on both sides, it gets stuck in a state of limbo. Since the teams persist through to the main menu (and always have to some extent, even if originally joining a friend/team member, it would dissolve the team), it persists even when they've left the world. In turn, since this player has issued an invite that never properly timed out, it's glitched these people to being unable to invite each other.
---
I think that's why quitting**\*** results in a group-wide solution, because that one player disconnecting **completely** (ie: signing out) causes the server to finally finish processing the internal invite event and properly time it out.
---
\-**\***\- *I can't remember exactly, but I seem to recall that in the most recent instance my friend and I required* ***her*** *to sign out in order to fix it, even though \_****I****\_ was the person to send the invite. I believe that we had issues, I could send the invite again, but she couldn't click accept. I went back to the menu, re-joined the world with her, but issue persisted. She did the same, but same issue. She couldn't send an invite to me I don't think, and so I reloaded the whole game, but didn't fix it. Then finally she reloaded the game and all was well.*
---
If you want to 'tag' them you need a forward slash before the 'u/so_and_so'.
---
Nice. I had one last night that cleared all of Watoga and I mean all of it. I caught sight of it down falling down somewhere north of the antique shop. Never found it in the bogs and it was only a 1\* so it wasn't worth the extra effort.
---
Doesn't change the fact that you can easily craft 100,000 ultracite ammo in under 30 days and would then be banned without breaking the rules.
---
Yea, I get it, there are a lot of desirable cosmetics. It's designed to get you to part with your dollars. Part with a few to get that item you really want now. For all else, just save and pick and choose which ones you really want. 
---
Cant wait to see
---
they used to be only obtainable from the SBQ
---
System?
---
I've done open mic before but I have had people think I was either lying or just respond with no emotes. They were probably hoping for a pvp encounter and I wasn't going to give it them.
---
It’d be nice to have a random, temporary schizophrenic after-effect every now and then. Like, enemies should just start appearing out of thin air or be floating above the ground; or maybe my gun should require a second reload even after I just topped it off. Or how about if my character experiences an overbearing paranoid sense of [DANGER] even when I’m all alone.
---
I’d enjoy that very much.
---
I thought I saw this before too but not sure where. I also primed this yesterday to burn some cobalt flux and the railway rifle is honestly garbage. Vats is horrible with it and it seems to not register hits. 
---
So your saying that it was easy for you to get items that someone's probably cheated into the game and if I don't do it as well then it's my problem WOW just WOW
---
Thx. I'm not saying I never drink a bottle in the game. But disappointed in the challenges.
---
That could be nice, and discourage constant use of stealth boys.
---
For me this isn’t really an option. I rely on lone wanderer and too many people run rad sponge. Losing rads and lone wanderer break my build. I just gotta pray I don’t dc 
---
Used to work. As of the last patch, it ain't working anymore.
---
Ban melee weapons
---
I agree, and personally think anything that comes to the atom store should be permanent, even if an introductory price is not. That way, you can work towards something for free in the long haul, even if you don’t get the best price, and feel less pressured to spend real money today
---
A friend gave me a Last bastion legendary that was urban scout armor
---
I been saying this for a while. Even if they are trash 3*s just give me the satisfaction lol 
---
I dont use the model you're speaking of, but my logitech mouse requires me to set up a specific game profile before launching the game. 
---
Its easier to launch the nuke then to kill the queen. Honestly most of the time I go to a prime nuke its either players that can kill it or crap geared lower lvls (40-100). Im doing most of the dmg and tanking her, Its never happend that I dont get loot. But ye star piece and some ultracite plans only gotten 3 recepies and my sbq kills ar above 100. lol
---
When I launch myself I also try to check the players on the server. If most are about 1-40 I server hop.
---
Fair enough, but constantly doing challenges instead of other in game stuff isn't my type of fun. Too guided. Same with achievement/trophy whore types., I just dont like it. "Do what they tell you and get some numbers" - *oh great* /s
---
Tell that to the people on the main fallout sub they think it would be similar like a main series title and keep comparing it as such. They also think it's fair to make that comparison because it has fallout in the title  It's honestly really dumb it's like comparing halo spartan assault to halo 4 or fallout shelter to 4.
---
Hahaha. Great write up.
---
Except, once again, you don't get banned for crafting. They can tell if an item was crafted or not.
---
Lol, the lowest form of depravity
---
I'm afraid that makes too much sense, sorry. 
---
I should have more faith in 'The Kindness of Strangers' :)
---
i made a suggestion post a while ago about how to make legendary weapons  drops more interesting and controllable by associating certain types of legendary weapons with different creatures melee weapons on ghouls for instance laser/plasma weapons on robots scorched have small arms/shotguns
---
while super mutants have big guns and rifle type weapons
---
Yes they stay at your camp :)
---
No have enough weapons in world. Each death no way game would be a joke if they made it that easy shoot u ever play Diablo 76 would be done by Summer if they made if oh a lvl 20 has unyielding for hiding in a shed.
---
Same!!!!! I wear headphones if i need to hear it now. Saves my eardrums from having the volume too loud when the shooting starts.
---
Ok, let's say that's true. What if someone else crafts it and I buy it... will I be banned
---
That’s a hate crime !
---
I don't have that one yet
---
have to be a short song.
---
Nice build. I sacrificed Endurance for Intellegence but otherwise very similar to my build.
---
Get me a “I killed a ⭐️⭐️⭐️legendary and all I got was this drill.” T-shirt!
---
Not a chem it’s a device , you can even see your char turn it on 
---
You have to Tame another unfortunately , i hope Bethesda changes that though.
---
He seems to have the misconception that the blast wave animation is actually tied to a tangible radius that kills as it expands from impact to the blast zone boundary; instead of the animation being simply that, an animation.
---
Right? Not sure why it's like that but hey, I'm not the one who made the map. 
---
I would like a mobile companion where i can customize the character build and read my notes and audios and stuff. Basically PIP BOY on my phone without the in game functionality like changing weapons and taking aid for now.
---
It's a survival thing carried over from our ancestors.  For most of our evolution there actually we're things staring at us in the woods.  Our brains are therefore very good at detecting faces, so much so that it detects them even when they are not there. Better safe than sorry works well for evolution :P
---
Basically all of them while storing valuable and potentially displayable junk in the stash. And also for the legendary vendor. And player vending. 
---
thanks. well, i guess i'll pass on this one, i couldn't survive my virtual cat's death
---
It’s doubled in Survival only. 
---
Would be cool if they offered a dog companion, as well as quest related companions you can unlock; such as an eyebot from the enclave, or a mr handy from gen atomics, etc. So much potential 
---
It’s called tobacco leaf, and it’s literally everywhere.
---
I would assume the fact that it is all up to the main guy who took everyone's caps to declare a winner. And also you can't complain to a manager or something. 
---
I disconnected and just shrugged it off and moved on. Then at 1 am, unable to sleep I made this post to try and salvage something from this lol. 
---
I haven't seen any player acquire, by legit means, 100.000+ of any item.
---
It doesn’t make any sense yeah 
---
What's the strategy?
---
I don't think so,, but you never know if Bethesda adds them to the Tameable list
---
I gain joy in the thought that no-one won. 
---
You don’t have to pay attention to your health. Once you get used to low hp you learn how much different enemies hit for and know when to take a diluted stim while fighting so you don’t die. It’s a learning curve but you get used to it. I fight the queen and 19hp and stim after each hit I take. It’s just a process you get used to. Attack, attack, take a hit, jump and stim, dive back in. Repeat. 
---
Out of everything that needs fixing in this game and you think they are gonna fix some broken windows??? Gtfoh 
---
Def needs to drop as legendaries as well, it looks do cool but isn't worth using.
---
As a sneaky sniper I would have to disagree with this.  I think the problem is the map pins for leaderboard.  When you are called out for everyone else, it doesn't really matter if you can sneak or hide or not.  They will find you.
---
I've been on the receiving end of some one shot kills as I've snuck through whitesprings, and it has actually given me a whole new perspective on how to move about the map.  I now stick to rooftops and hide behind trees and move slowly, and look and listen.  And because of this change in perspective, I've been able to turn the tables a couple times and get the drop on people.
---
And for you melee players, you can still rage charge people....i was on the whitesprings roof sniping ghouls and a girl with a sledgehammer snuck up behind me and smashed me to pieces before I could turn around.  I was expecting that only other sneaky snipers would take to the rooftops, but was proven wrong...
---
Submitted them all
---
Hmm I think actually I just did an uppercase u
---
I agree completely!
---
No I’m not saying that it was easy. I’ve spent all those hours farming caps and buying and selling items to make profits to acquire these items, I’ve spent easily over 75k to acquire all of it. I just seen the bigger picture that PVP was eventually coming and prepared for it. I didn’t spend caps on hats or masked or outfits that don’t mean anything to having an advantage in PVP. And no offence yes it is your problem that you can’t hang in PvP. Sorry for that but it’s true. People go in their with quality of life builds and no aspect of the battle mechanics. Every build had a counter it’s jut a matter of figuring it out. 
---
I feel your pain.  I have to practically put my nose against the screen when an enemy will drop a weapon with a very long name since it scrunches the name into microletters to make it all fit in the loot window. 
---
Well here’s the thing. The reason why you loss so much is because you were the one to carry that many around on you. You don’t need 353 stimpacks to survive. 5 to 10 should work.
---
So do you just grab multiple workshops?
---
I try to pair up like-minded weapons. For example, a survivalist character might carry a shotgun, hunting rifle, a melee weapons (hatchet or Bowie knife), and/or a revolver. Swapping the rifle for a crossbow is often fun as well
---
A scavenger or raider would use pipe guns with the bladed tire iron.
---
Try putting on a Civil War uniform and using the black powder rifle and pistol or swap the black powder pistol out for a revolutionary sword and old army revolver. (I find that the ranger hat pairs well with the Union outfit and the worn fedora with the Confederate outfit as well)
---
Under level 50 I advise to not repair armor and instead just make new armor. Not worth the ballistic fiber imo
---
The mask would look great if it wasn’t attached to a bobble hat. Still I’m rocking the whole outfit 
---
Supressor is 30% and only last for 2 seconds so you have to constantly be reapplying the debuff for it to work.
---
I see it both ways. On one hand I don't want to get up to read the thin line scribbles, but then I think if I were in the wasteland, the notes would probably be more faded and harder to read. 
---
With the ammo Smith perk and the super duper perk you can very easily craft that many if you wanted to transfer that ammo to a second character you would get banned therefore the system is flawed and innocent people can be banned which means we shouldn't crap all over anyone who was banned as a "duper" even people who killed dupers and picked up their duped junk to throw into the fissure sites or drop somewhere else during the super hunts were banned.
---
Looks good
---
Pretty good idea.
---
The crafting system is my biggest issue with the game. Which I know isn’t that high on most people’s list.
---
I am sneak sniper too. Killed few people who had absolutly idea where i am. Thats boring. And i also been killed from unknown direction. I can see non-sneaking players on compass, thats right in my opinion also if you look on then u see icon over head. You dont see icon over sneaking player which is good, because you shouldnt see him. But direction on compas could be good.
---
They do want, so do you. What other people think of 76 shouldn't bother you, nor should you care. So long as it doesnt **directly** impacts you.
---
A friend gave me a Last Bastion Legendary chest that was Urban scout armor
---
Reading all these posts makes me feel self conscious lol...
---
I carry a 44 recon magnum (need to remove the scope but Im lazy), a hardened handmade, combat shotgun, refined sniper rifle, long hard( ; ) )ened pipe revolver namely cuz i chuckle like a child but it hits hard when i need it, a silenced 10mm because ever since fo3 ive always had one, and a Blade of Bastet sword that Im trying to decide if i want or if I wanna use Black Diamond instead
---
Usually leaves me around 100 lbs with armor, deep pocketed armor and a strength of 8 or so keeps me at 235 lbs max, but I carry excavator armor too so overall it sounds like a lot but the weights not an issue. I just really like being dynamic with my guns. The sniper and 10mm are for sneaking or stalking people to scare if things attack me
---
Still should be fun being hunted. I'll just try carry nothing 
---
Problem is....how to also deal with the leechers?
---
Why wouldn't they work in photomode lol
---
I have the Suppressor Legendary effect as well on my Battleaxe.
---
Why don't they just make survival mode survival mode. No player icons no bounties none of that crap. Just simply surviving in the wilderness. If you run into a player whether they're he's a hundred levels above you or 200 levels below you you decide if you want to fight or not. Real-life survival none of this other crap. 
---
Let's just be honest. This isn't a survival mode this is a PVP mode. And I'm fine with that but let's call it what it is.
---
I am sneak sniper. When i shoot people, they dont have way to defend, cause they had absolutly idea from which way i shoot. I had same isue with other sneaky snipers. Its not fun for both sides.
---
+karma xD
---
I had killed this level nine heading towards Helvetia. I had left all his or her junk and aid on the ground for them to retrieve, walk a few yards away, and find that he had used 400 caps to put a 200 cap bounty on me. 
---
The 3 star ought to be a moneyback guarantee for a 3 star piece.  Killed queen twice yesterday, 1 Star legendary x2 and blew through a ton of ammo.  Heck killed a 3 star glowing one, let 3 others tag, and got zip (not sure if other 3 got anything).  This to me is one of the top 5 QOL things they need to work on (right behind perk card templates).
---
Also why are the ultracite “suit” pieces still on the drop table?  Totally useless to be that way unless you’re supporting quest line skipping for no apparent reason.
---
Ah okay that  makes more sense. 
---
While that would be interesting, server stability I think will be the sticking point. All those notes found, holotapes and the amount of spoiled food and what not cluttering that free stuff box may be a bit much.
---
I've found quite a bit left behind in the suitcases and cash registers and the like. Left behind plenty as well. I do hope people find what I "donated", but the items placed are ones that I'm ok with losing. 
---
If the server eats them, I assume it gets distributed to random super mutants or vendors so others can find the loot that way. Lol 
---
Sorry, but that is blatantly false. You don't see people banned saying: "yeah I crafted this much ammo and got banned for it" - because they know it isn't possible by legit means. Instead, they say "hey, they banned me *for nothing*!"
---
I've said many times that I picked up millions of weight in crafting materials from a duper, and I'm not banned. Not only that, but a dozen players came too and picked even more stuff, and they aren't banned either.
---
Thanks. I've been using a Single Action Revolver up till now. I'll save my caps and buy the plans. Then, of course, find one in the very next container I look in.
---
i would support it if your kills was reset upon death
---
Worst don’t possible. I have tons of notes and can’t read most of the damn things. 
---
It can be annoying however eliminating sneak is it the answer.  Maybe have pings show up on compass briefly during gunshots but definitely not remove the sneak mechanic lol
---
I agree.  We have nice windows with the Brick and Steel building sets, why not the Barn set?  At least have one variation that has non-broken windows.
---
While we're at it....
---
Why do we not have 1/2 and 1/4 sized versions of laminate flooring?  
---
We have the crappy wood and steel grate versions...  It shouldn't be that hard...
---
Why do we have half height walls and not half-height stairs?  
---
I'd like add different color outside walls to my multi-story building to add some syle and give a feeling of space on each level.  Today I need to use two half-height walls to make it a full level only because of the stairs.  If we had half-height stairs, then I could use the extra budget for other things.
---
On a side note, I found out that if you create a circular wall using doors (see youtube for many examples) alternate foundations on either side of the doors, blueprint it, then place the blueprint, the foundations all end up overlapped inside of the doors creating a clean outer appearance and a circular style inside foundation.  You can't move them without screwing it up and I need to do some more testing to see if there is a way to use this to create a circular pool....
---
I found my camp while I was exploring the mountains behind the amusement park. I ended up running across some tents that had an amazing view of that whole region. And at night all the water glows. It's also the only camp I've ever had that doesn't spawn mobs every single time I fast travel to it.
---
Being able to switch perks is neat, I like that I can craft any turret or pick any lock by just turning them on real quick while not sacrificing better perks for it
---
I have around 34 perception, and I don't notice any issues. My railway is bloodied so 389 damage. Prime weapons are terrible anyways. 
---
Definitely be teamed up with someone, even if they don't do the silo run with you.  I've heard story after story of people going for their first nuke getting disconnected as soon as it hits.  With a teammate you can at least sign right back in and get to experience your own nuke zone.
---
SBQ is massively above your level, but possible if there are a bunch of higher level folks that jump into the zone.  Check who's on your server right before nuking to make sure there's at least half a dozen people over 100 on.  They'll likely jump to the zone.
---
Play day z, arc, Minecraft, or any other number of games such as that lol
---
No, you’re not too low level. Once you launch, no one cares what level you are. 
---
Just make sure you aim it correctly. I’ve seen players center it on the OTHER Fissure Site down there, and completely missed the Prime Site. Don’t be that guy. 
---
YES this is what I’m talking about. Some of it must be intentional 
---
These guys are legit being sued for shit they fucked up royally on.  
---
We don’t need to add frivolous crap too until they fail to fix things after being asked.
---
I’d like to see the game fixed eventually so I can return to playing, not deep sixed because of legal shit. 
---
Oh god, there is no way to explain it to you guys.

Nothing surprises me with them anymore since they've sold out to China after all the work they did to limit censorship. They've removed 'don't be evil' from their code of conduct too.
---
Also, it’s actually easier to clear the silo solo, as less enemies spawn. But it’s a huge help if you have Hacker Level 3 and to a lesser extent, lockpick Level 3. 
---
Because everything at the workshop is the owner's property
---
Or that :P
---
I am also swinging the axe like a mad axe murderer too xD. I don't know if it gets applied on a 'miss in VATS' that still keeps your crit bar unused.
---
Im in est in us but I'm always down. 
---
Yeah platform?
---
Clear an area, then hang out and wait for respawns. My second pass through Huntersville before work this morning (I do it before and after my daily vendor runs) all the muties were level 68, one crowned and two legendary.
---
I've had a set of level 25 excavator for a long time, my GT is Reapus Creepus. It's yours if you join on me or message me on xbl
---
Cheers I'll try message people on the server before I do it and see if they'll help me out because I'd hate to go through all the effort of collecting the codes and then get nothing for it. Thanks for the advice
---
Haha for real? that's awesome that you could hire someone to do that. 
---
Nice handle
---
It's hard to tell as you say .. I normally jump servers so I don't get farmed for caps and most are there to actually farm you for caps or want the workshop unfortunately ... but I guess I should wait for the contest to happen. How come someone can take the workshop even during an event ? I thought the event had to complete or is that still the case, I noticed, if I went to the workshop during an event it will say, take over workshop for so many caps.
---
Really? Thank you!! I’m level 212 and I had NO IDEA. I still feel like I’m a total n00b. 
---
Would love to see how you guys did the fight pits. I’m no PvPer myself 
---
Yeah they're good dudes. If you like what you see I can refer you to them 
---
Haha I probably would have done that if ya didn't give me the heads ups about it, thanks
---
I dont know, I just bought a lollipop for 50 cents and it contains billions of atoms
---
Cool I'll try get up another level to get hacker level 3 so 
---
Including loot unique to me? I get the concept but it's a weird choice for the game to make
---
Great idea but you wont fool the SB's and the Mole rats.
---
It is impressive, but it's harder than what i'm doing. The learning curve is steeper for bloodied.
---
I think I read that as soon as you attach power to your vending machine, it appears on the map.

---
It's tight, but rely on critical hits and your good splitting your weapon types. 
---
You're gonna be best with tarberry juice or sunshine oil but even razorgrain flour will do and is easy to make a lot of. Def. want speed demon mutation as well. Keep water and food topped off for extra AP, corn is prolly easiest as it provides a good amount of food/water with help from end perks so in total extra HP and AP.
---
If you can get your hotkeys straight and used to em you can easily switch between weapon types and keep everything topped off .. and don't disregard gum either, gum is good … freshens the breath for kissing females, but keeps hunger at bay.
---
Serendipity procs surprisingly a lot and let's you focus more on fighting and will usually proc survivor if you don't stay in harm's way, just round a corner and use sneak which escape artist should kick in.
---
When you say Bloodied PA melee build, is that with Emergency Protocols?
---
As a legendary three star man has once said
---
“It just works”
---
Launch 3 waves of 3 simultaneous nukes. 
---
Yup, totally agree. It's impacted the entire game experience for me.  My vision is fine, but even on a large flatscreen, unless I'm standing 2 feet away, it's really hard to read. 
---
I basically just don't read or listen to holotapes. Wait, I should clarify, I TRY to, but then I can't hear them unless I crank my TV. (not a great option when playing at night and the rest of the house is asleep) Notes I pretty much ignore and just judge their value by if they come up as a quest after opening them.
---
Post your complaint again if this actually ever happens
---
I can't read half of what's on those notes either. I hope they implement the FO3/NV mechanic that displays all note text on your Pip-Boy
---
^this. Launching the nuke solo is fine but you might be a bit low for SBQ. I launched my first around the same level but left the SBQ to those capable seeing as more players = increased dmg resist to SBQ and more enemies. 
---
When you get in take full advantage of any terminals that let you “remove targeting parameters” as this will allow the turrets to target the robots. You can just hide away, then deactivate them and stroll on through the pile of robot corpses
---
Well a lot of that comes from when Pete Hines said "No" when someone asked him if this was a spin-off. Meaning in Bethesdas eyes, despite it using a new branch it's still considered a main entry in the series. Perhaps because it's using a very similar engine build as FO4 with some changes 
---
awesome, thanks
---
41 weapons, just counted
---
In the early days of FO76 I watched a YouTube gameplay video (by someone who really ought to know better) where the YouTuber was puzzled at the use of wood for cooking. He wondered if the wood was used to make kebab sticks. No joke.
---
I don't know, that's why I asked.
---
I wish events would scale to the level of whatever player activates them. I like doing horde events, but when they proc anywhere other then the mire or the bog they're all low level, and even sometimes in the bog they're level 30ish. 
---
Trust, I have noticed. There are always 2-3 low level super mutants that spawn behind my camp. I dropped a turret there that seems to keep them in control. 
---
Sorry my dude, the workshops are the most exploitable thing in adventure mode right now so I trust no-one.
---
Fwiw I Carry 
---
1) hardened sniper rifle suppressed 
---
2) perforating handmade suppressed
---
3) lever action suppressed
---
4) 10mm suppressed
---
About 500 rounds of ammo for all 
---
For melee molerats and ticks
---
Executioners legendary sledge
---
Assaultron blade
---
Same hear. Most of the time they ignore me and get on with the killing, although I assume they're keeping an eye on me.
---
Yes, they work in photomode. Photomode captures what's on your screen.
---
When you drop on the SBQ, have your blast radius just below dropsite V9. If you have a decent group, they know to lure her out of the nuke zone. 
---
But as stated above, check the map for higher lvls before you even run the silo. Nothing worse than hitting the queen and you're the only one down there
---
Maybe I should visit you to see with my own eyes ;)
---
When it's up and running you should come and spectate!
---
I have been unable to do any intoxication challenges. My character will never get drunk no matter how much alcohol he consumes.
---
An Assaultron in a summer dress might be nice. And she'd keep down the molerats.
---
If you want some happy-go-lucky people to hang out and bash super mutants with join us on discord

Please stop posting suggestions on this sub
---
Totally this. "It's not for me" is different from "It's crap". It's amazing how people just don't apply that simple logic. I hated Dark Souls, I know it's probably a great game. I even *shush* hated the original Resident Evil after the initial wow wore off. I understand it's been a fairly popular series though and that doesn't mean it's crap.
---
Noticed you can't logout and keep going back to the same one. You have to kill them around the map. Got 4 recorded yesterday but the ones that didn't record were kills from the same area I'd been before.
---
If you can get the thrill of the grill daily up at hemlock holes it will sometimes give some armor as one of the rewards that would be level appropriate for you.
---
F to pay respects to this game's potential.
---
If there was a hint of realism, you wouldn’t drop it in a paper bag.
---
Yes. My first nuke, I didn’t disarm turrets and it was HELL. Still got through it (I was Level like 168 or something), but it becomes worlds easier when you don’t have to deal with them. 
---
The stash could be restricted for curtain items.
---
No notes, holotapes and food allowed for example.
---
Or there could be a weight limit. If the box is full but you think, you have something good to add, you have to take something different out before. 
---
I recently had to do some cleaning of my weapons inventory. Weapon weight reducing armor ruined me. For awhile i ran around like a one man militia. Carry weight wasnt a problem till i wanted to use power armor. Im currently still running with a few rifles and melees and one fatman a few handguns and one shotty. I like variety and sometimes i try to match the weapon with the apparel im using. Still need to downsize a bit but ill get there eventually
---
I see folks dropping stuff in the artisans corner all the time
---
For train stations it’s the luggage bags that hold ammo recipes and plans 
---
You could probably use the trash bins next to the bathroom doors in each train station as well.
---
&gt;I am all for microtransactions in the context of how Bethesda has done it - cosmetics!
---
Yep, yep, yep. I'm all for cosmetics... to a point. When Bethesda is charging almost $20 for a single color I find that a bit ridiculous. 
---
If Bethesda had launched 76 with things like the camouflage bundle in the game I don't think people would have minded as much. Here's a great pack for 1500 atoms, it has weapons, power armor, regular armor, and is a legit decent deal. But they launched with almost nothing in the atom shop, and of the items that were in there, most were ridiculously costly.
---
And now we're seeing new power armor paint schemes come in at 800 and 1000 atoms, meanwhile that Vault Tec blue is still at 1800. 
---
They gotta get rights to the song. Hence so many oldies. Are you gonna ask for Wagon wheel next? 
---
Don’t group us into ‘all’. We didn’t ‘all’ want an online game where people are afraid of conflict. 
---
Side note. I do enjoy the devil makes three! 
---
Can you lock stash boxes? Maybe that's what happened?
---
I'm assuming so, I'm normally too busy putting rounds down and trying to get tf out of the way of the CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP to ask them what torso mod they're running. I know the Bloodied PA Two Hand in our group runs Emergency Protocols
---
Yep. That's why Whitesprings seems to always be level 42-62 ghouls but still has a quest for 10 feral golfers (level 9) and the Mistress of Mystery quest to get a level 25 sword. All the low-level "natural" spawns get cleared out early in the server life and the three-digit players tromping through constantly keep the respawns pegged at max.
---
Yeah I had killed ones in different areas but it still says 0/25?
---
Just time gate the items and remove them from the world after an hour or so and limit it to weapons and armor.
---
Yeah but then it wouldn’t be a huge detriment to people who bring over characters that they used since the beginning, and would cripple people who have the decency to make new characters for survival.
---
That sounds reasonable.  Thanks!
---
Wait are you guys talking about the daily alcohol recipe thing from Biv or daily challenges that happen to be alcohol related?
---
The daily challenges are supposed to be stupid and silly. I don't do them.
---
A lot of people like tattered buildings for there wasteland abode. Not everyone wants nice neat looking houses in a Wasteland
---
I don't know what to tell you, my dude. I save "really bothers me" for things that actually matter, and I'd recommend you do the same instead of getting invested in other people liking the same video game that you do.
---
It's whatever button you normally use to throw grenades, only you press it once instead of holding it.
---
Did the sever also pay 150 caps and pass out? 
---
Wow
---
I’m on PS4:) The area is a little ways down from Sunnytop station right before you hit the run down shack.
---
Thanks :) 
---
Maybe stop fast traveling to the same train station over and over again.
---
If you say this was different train stations, walk or travel to events instead.
---
For clarification, are you using a hyperbole or have you actually been charged 140 caps for moving a CAMP in a close vicinity? 
---
World generated safe not stash box
---
A .308 hunting rifle, a laser pistol, a .45 pipe revolver, a .10mm, and a dozen assorted explosives.
---
It’s enough to get by, off the occasional scorched or ghoul, and build.
---
Ok, we're talking about invisibility here. We can't talk about that and realism at the same time. The term you want is immersive, but they can't still have it immersive and improve the UX (user experience) when invisible. Maybe have a little dot show up in that case that is like the player character knowing where they're aiming. The player isn't in the character, so they can't feel where they are aiming and it makes it a pain to deal with. Something can be done to improve UX in this case that doesn't break immersion.
---
&gt; I preordered this game without question because I’m a Fallout fan.
---
That doesn't make you a fan; it makes you a consumer who has invested some portion of their personal identity in what they purchase from a franchise. 
---
I a actually like a lot of these changes. Usually I see these post and click on them to see a laugh at the horrible suggestions but I actually agree with a lot of these. 
---
Just an observation 
---
So the leaderboard only lists top 3 longest living users
---
Survival mode encourages individual PvP
---
What I haven’t seen is
---
A groups of people *teams in leaderboards
---
What if like to see is a group of people play as a team survive and get listed on leaderboard
---
Unsure of what team amount that should be. 
---
3, 5 8?
---
If it’s possible to survive as a team, get listed in leaderboard, then factions idea could work
---
I just haven’t lived long enough to see past my own death lolz
---
Well, I mean, that wouldnt incur any risks, would it?
---
You can go to watoga to kill the robots 
---
;) I know they struggle to get rights for songs. But a song in an add probably costs less than getting the ling term license of an in game radio song. And good advertising can often more than make up for expenses depending on the recording label. Just thought I’d throw this song out there because it seems so fitting.
---
Also please no Wagon Wheel lol. Some Colter Wall and Tyler Childer is dark and southern enough to make my wish list though.
---
Well good. Easy cores at least
---
Make then unkillable till they regenerate all three stars. No matter how fast you damage them down, they will regenerate a full health bar 3 times.
---
That should go a long way toward making them worth the effort.
---
If you're on xbox I learned this and can craft or you. But I've seen the actual mod at harpers ferry and i believe watoga 
---
I just wish the Daily Quests would continue if you get disconnected. I do them almost never because of stability issues. Ecological Balance  also has a weird bug that makes me get the password every time and it's a 50/50 shot it crashes when I get the password.
---
True I’m just throwing ideas out there lol just curious of the plausibility of this 
---
Wes-Tek, Harpers Ferry, Watoga. The Fissure sites in the cranberry bog can be good too but there a lot harder to clear. 
---
26 downvotes?? Come on people.
---
I’m with you dude. If you check my post history I bitched long and hard about the atom concept - but that was when we were getting zero new content and the game was glitchy as fuck.
---
They’re actually investing time and effort and giving us new features now, and if it takes a few microtransactions to keep that coming - cool by me.
---
1. The game is out, and new reviews other than customer reviews don't come in. A game is usually reviewed when it's fresh and not with every litttle update.
---
2. Professional magazines / websites are doind SEO for their content, it's their livelihood. Why wouldn't they, it's a business, not a hobby fro them.
---
3. No matter how much we are enjyoing the game (I log in almost daily), the bad reviews were not unjustified. Let's not forget that. The technical issues are still not all gone (or come back once in a while), and the conceptual mistakes are largely still in the game. 
---
4. Search for more specific terms when you google something related to FO76, then you get directly to the fallout wikia or whereever wiithout seein gthose reviews.
---
Now you can downvote me, since I said that the games has issues. That usually triggers the ultra fanboys.
---
I literally crafted 100,000 plus 5mm ultracite ammo as a test after the ban wave. It is absolutely possible legit with the ammosmith and suoerduoer perk. You are wrong. 
---
🙃that's just what the rebuilders of Appalachia have to deal with I guess😖
---
Other games handle this by providing a way to view normal text. Probably the easiest method for them would be to allow changing the font of letters.
---
&gt;*friendly Chinese*
---
That's an odd way to spell "treason"
---
No but I did get a crisp 100 bill when I logged back in. And then the whole server clapped. 
---
I enjoy using my Bloodied Explosive Lever Action, not sure who said that explosive wasn't worth getting?
---
After the nerfs/bugs/"fixes" from the last couple patches, my rifle is down to exactly 700 paper damage at 20% hp (I don't use chems).  Add in the 3.75x modifier for sneaking at night and the 2,625 dmg one-shots anything but scorchbeasts (they take 2-3 shots depending on where I hit).
---
The only VATS perk I use is Concentrated Fire, and even then I'm able to rapidly engage and terminate anything running at me before it gets close.
---
Here's the build I'm currently using, had to tweak it a bit for Survival mode:
---

---
I have it paired with matching mutations and a full set of Unyielding Heavy BoS Combat Armor that has a mix of tertiary stats to reduce weight of ammo/weapons/food; those combined give me a DR of 556.  Add in the other damage mitigation perks and it becomes a very survivable Bloodied build that one-shots nearly everything.  Players in full assassins/sentinel take 2-3 shots to kill unless they are moving.
---
I built myself a spreadsheet that compares damage vs a range of armor values (1-600) to see how Stock, Bloodied, Two Shot, Anti-Armor, and Instigating relate, and Bloodied weapons with a Bloodied build hands down beats the others out, even AA.
---
Wagon wheel was a joke. I can't stand old crow anymore.. And I'm an avid folk, bluegrass, Americana fan
---
Is it much better now than back in November 2018? ABSOLUTELY!!!
---
Killed probably around 8 and only 4 registered. When they did register, I hopped and killed again, nothing.
---
Can't agree more, it's annoying and needs to be removed, it's way too loud. 
---
Oh it is. It's exhilarating. When you see your name in that top 3, you feel alive. Until you are murdered. And you will be murdered. Hard.
---
I know man. I have a friend that adores the Fallout games, but won't give it a chance because of the bad press around it.
---
*Not just walls and buildings, but hearts and minds, and ultimately America itself.*
---
In all seriousness, I have been begging BGS to add the junk structures from Fallout 4 since day one. I find the existing player built structures to look incredibly out of place. I hope one day we'll get them! 
---
In the meantime, I've found building into existing crappy stuctures to be a good alternative. I found a windmill made of cars stacked on top of each other; on a hill in the Toxic Valley overlooking Grafton. 
---
It’s have to be a pretty severe penalty for 50% or less health to balance it. Sort of like how beserker’s scales both ways depending on DR. Which, as a side note, needs to be buffed because it’s fucking terrible
---
Are you banned?
---
STILL A FUCKING PROBLEM.
---
I can't believe this is happening STILL. I just got the game today and this bullshit is preventing me from playing.
---
Yeah I mean I went to multiple different places and not a single legendary enemy counted, where they were counting for my friend so I don’t know, I put in a help ticket to Bethesda support so hopefully they give me some sort of information on it.
---
They made the game exactly like this because of gamers like you spending money on the mtx shop. Thank you. 
---
Lol which part?  The increase in turret range and damage was announced yesterday.  The base building on spawn points and Wes Tek had already happened.  Not sure I understand your comment :P
---
am I asking too much? Have not done many trades yet.
---
Hmmm I'll take a loot into that thanks for reporting!
---
Thats how I do it. Why spend 20 levels to switch every time when I can spend 50 levels once?
---
well that is better than nothing, least ye can scrap taht
---
I just upgraded to powered roll up doors this week. I do not have a problem , but I am using fusion. I don’t recall seeing the power requirements. 
---
"Take a loot" lmfao so YOU TOOK IT
---
It used to be the same with ESO. Nowadays ESO is considered one of the best mmorpgs. 
---
It will be the same with Fallout76. 
---
I'm sure there is.  If nobody is "getting" your point then you're either not using the right words and phrases to express your position or they do all infact get your point and find your points invalid.
---
I am on Xbox, do you know how much it downgrades damage?
---
I knew u were joking :) it’s so hard to sound polite and playful on Reddit lol. Everything gets read like it’s a personal attack here. Thanks for the comment man. I often listen to folk and bluegrass as well. If you have any good song suggestions to listen to while I roam Appalachia feel free to leave suggestions for me. 
---
That moment when a typo gives me an awesome pun. I refuse to edit and fix that comment!!
---
The script for the event would determine if the player has done anything???? If the script could recognize if the intestines were put in the cooler or if the music is being played on stage, why wouldn't it recognize if a player is contributing to the event? 
---
Good lord that's impressive. Have they upped the budget or camp size since launch? That's just mind bottling that you were able to build this in the camp system. You win the internet today
---
I disagree. Cosmetic sales are fine. Let people spend all they want. It has no impact on anyone else's gameplay. No one has to go grind these dailies just to stay competitive.
---
Workshop PVP is not griefing. It's explicitly warned that you can have others attack you when you claim one.
---
Gotta only shoot them now and track where the bodies fly 
---
Its a bug. 
---
Junkies in already in the game and serves this purpose, berserkers as well.  Just gotta pick your sacrifice: health/armor/withdrawal stats.  Nocturnal weapons are also really good at night, letting you skip the sacrifice.  All options for a high health build.
---
Garage door has worked fine for me for the last few months at least.  
---
What problems are you having?
---
Wire power to switch then wire switch to door.  
---
For me its the bugs and crashes, after countless BGS games, its got to a point where I can't overlook the shodyness of the GameByro engine, it needs a overhaul and badly, Starfield and ESVI are not gonna go down well if this engine is powering them again
---
A Fallout MMO is a great idea, I'm not even a Elder Scrolls fan and ESO does this really well, hell FO76 is great idea that feels kinda held back, the anger people had I think was a bit unjustified but I understand
---
 Well, the iron sights aren’t invisible, just transparent so imo it makes sense for the reflex dot to be transparent as well.
---
I agree there should be some consistency. 
---
There are zero negatives for V.A.T.S. , third person, or scoped chameleon users so a little love for the reflex users isn’t too much to ask imho.
---
The tag team attack outside of the workshop, I consider griefing.
---
Ok thank you mate for helping a lvl 24 out 
---
&gt; We have nice windows with the Brick 
---
Uhm, my brick walls are completely windowless. There's no glass pane there, it's just a hole. 
---
Whiskey - +2 STR  
---
All others - +1 STR  
---
Nukashine - Awesomeness  
---
That’s all I need to know. 
---
Hi Reddi, we've mentioned this in the past but I will bring this back up to the Dev's again. Thank you for posting!
---
Nahhhh, it's one of those fancy slim euro-rail trains, lol
---
Hahaha. Sure, buddy. Whatever you say. You're the one who's been screeching like a little bitch because you know you don't have an actual argument or evidence.
---
Definitely been charged 140 caps, in fact, I paid around 700 caps by the time I was done as I had to keep adjusting the borders as the harvester kept refusing to place as it was on the border. The more frequent you move your camp, the more you get charged, making minor adjustments to the same camp in the same spot spot shouldn't cost you.
---
Holster your weapon before fast travel 
---
They don’t disappear but sometimes the bodies fly pretty far and high it’s kinda funny once your only shooting them 
---
No body, it literally just poofed out of existence as I was hitting the respawn button 
---
im looking for donations not a solution pal
---
Cool thank you!
---
This request is on the front page with a ton of upvotes already lol.  That said, what the heck are all of you talking about? I never hear it lol
---
Can you explain a little further? I'm not quiet sure what they are trying to do by your description.
---
Are you at the end game, or do you still have missions in the storyline to complete?
---
Fairly sure all containers already have a time gate. At least, I've gone back to an area a few hours after exploring it and containers I know I looted were replenished. 1 hour may be too short with the character limits per server. But I do agree they should be timed. 
---
Yeah, that’s true.  But they look nicer without broken glass.   We have glass in the game, we should be able to make windows.  
---
I though that too till I did a search pattern and found way the f out there 
---
I carry 4 MAX. ususally 2-3. Depends on their weight though. If you have something that weighs 90% less than you couls carry it too. Rifles are just REALLY Heavy.
---
I watched it hit the ground and vanish 
---
I have evidence of you being a pedophile creeper who masturbates to brony porn, so that's a pretty solid argument as far as I'm concerned that you're literally subhuman trash whose opinion has no merit or value, and the world would be infinitely better off if you put a gun in your mouth and pulled the trigger until it goes click. 
---
Ok ok 
---
I bought a cc package when it was released (£25?) and only just spent the last of it on some of the newest stuff the other day.
---
I'll never be a 🐋 lol
---
You have to listen the holotapes "Last words" and "operation free watoga log 322" you found in
---
I apologise if I am misunderstanding your question but here's an ELI5 anyway:
---
Say your target has a DR of 100.
---
36% antitank perk = 64 DR
---
Piercing mag= 35% of 64 = 22 points off = 42 DR
---
AA = 50% of 42 = 21, leaving 21 pts of DR remaining. 
---
For a grand total of 79% DR from all perks together. 
---
Hopefully that's useful
---
Agreed I wanted a wasteland experience not Disney land one
---
WEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
Weight limit would be good for stability reasons.  
---
Maybe nothing that expires would be better (and no notes / holo). I do leave behind various food/water/stims/chems on occasion. Those would get snatched up quick I would think. 
---
For what its worth its not the sort of item that people that search reddit for trades are likely to buy. level 40 base means its below the max damage roll (if it were on a level 50 for example), and whilst the exploding perk is nice, its not as good as its used to be. Combined with pistols being fairly underused, you may just have better luck crafting the ammo yourself.
---
It's a bug
---
How do these bloodied builds not get constantly killed?
---
This. Any enemy with a crown has the extra loot you are looking for. 
---
I've really been jamming Ginstrings lately! 💚💚💚
---
&gt; But they look nicer without broken glass. 
---
I'll have to agree with you there. 
---
Another thing i'd like to see are interior walls. 
---
Not one side orange, the other side white, i want both sides white.
---
It is not a workshop contest, they dont want the workshop. They wait for you to leave. One team member contests the workshop for 1 second and stops. This puts you in pvp mode, wherever you are, without notifying you. Then the other team member that follows you starts attacking. You take immediate full damage because of the other guy back at the workshop.
---
Mine are always when eating an aid item, and more often when I own a workshop and eat an aid item.  
---
Ah ok.
---
As long as the Razer Synapse software has been used to configure the buttons to keyboard keys, it should work. I'm using an Orbweaver and Razer Tron mouse with custom mapping but have trouble in games without the software.
---
I want it play as a disabled person. Vision, accuracy and mental hindering implemented. 
---
/s 
---
The absolute greatest analogy for my life right here. 
---
Yesterday I had a guy follow show up to my workshop, contested it just to kill me and take what he could off my body, which was nothing. He didn't even claim the spot. Then later on in the day, a guy followed me to 3 different workshops just to kill me. I call that griefing. They weren't even good spots, he just wanted my caps and loot. I was level 28, he was 213.
---
Check out fo4 numbers here [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
FWIW you can manually lock those if its within the workshop's boundary. I do it all the time to safes and ammo boxes knowing someone's gonna slip up haha
---
Yup it’s a real bummer. I won’t even touch workshops anymore. 
---
One day someone will push you out and get stuck them selves. 
---
Even worse when there are other bodies next to it. I've had it where there were 3-4 bots grouped up. Naturally, VATS picked the legendary last. 
---
The scavenger hunt for them can get annoying for sure. I thought they had a 10 second delay before. 
---
Mad Max did that too.
---
This game gives me hardcore flashbacks to Star Wars Galaxies with stuff like this
---
Thats your fault for not watching your back in all honesty. You should always expect workshops to be contested at some point. Its not griefing its fair game via workshop
---
Soooo much spoiled food would be in there, but yes I like the idea. Always irks me when I drop free stuff, not knowing if it'll go to a good home or not
---
I carry a grog axe, knife, and lever action. That’s it. Before a queen fight I’ll grab a few more melee weapons in case any break. I never carry more than 3 weapons for wandering though 
---
People are too picky now. 
---
Personally this is how i felt a fallout game should be. I felt that at time the worlds were just too populated to be living in nuclear fallout. Especially with the amount of super mutants, raiders, and general walking death all over the place. 
---
While no "Main" Story there is tons of lore and information peppered through out that really fleshes out the world and gives IMO a better sense of what went down. I feel that there is more story in FO76 then the others to be honest. Plus the voice acting in the holotapes are pretty dam good. 
---
A primary melee (currently a zealot's mole miner gauntlet), a secondary melee in case that breaks (a vampiric death tambo), a ranged weapon (Bunker Buster with a targeting computer), and a LOLs weapon (an assassin's grenade launcher with +50% limb damage). Plus about 6 to 10 grenades and 6 to 10 molotovs and a couple-few landmines. I like diversity in my implements of murder.
---
Looks sweet but only 2 pics?
---
yep!!!! it is completely overpriced. I own very few cosmetic armor paints (the rainbow metal one I can only use on one piece of my armor for example. I'm sad I can't use it on all!)
---
For me, the funniest part of the story isn't the server kick. I had to spend caps 3 times over a session to keep a workshop claimed after i kept getting kicked. I get it. 
---
The funniest part was the guy in the background bragging how bad ass he was. Did he sound about 12? Did somebody at least tell him to go and get onto a PvP server instead, and prove it. Details! Lol. 
---
I'm confused about the level complaint isnt a level fifty basically the same as as a level 250 since you don't gain any more special and you have access to all the perks by 50
---
Its exploiting the mechanics, that's why they only contest it for 1 sec. So you are not notified like you should be. But like I said, I do watch my back, and they were unable to play their dirty trick on me.
---
But this is only relevant if you had claimed the workshop, you said you hadn’t so I’m not sure what your point is, sound like just normal PVP outside of a workshop.
---
What is your game tag?  I've been working on my Outpost Zeta on the edge of the Savage Divide/Bog.
---
Can you do any tricks? You want my caps, you gotta earn them.
---
Did anyone else notice that "Tumbling Tumbleweeds"  by Sons of the Pioneers was in the beta, but removed in the final game?
---
I only find it weird because there's another song by the same band in the game, so it wasn't a licensing issue, I wonder why they dropped that one?
---
I love that song and it always makes me think of the big lebowski
---
Ah could be a team thing. Was doing it solo.
---
Not really how can that be an explout when it is bethesdas intentions for this to happen
---
There was no pvp. They tried. But I did not fall in the trap
---
That does seem legitimately confusing.  The real solution would be "Maybe we shouldn't have world safes inside Workshops."
---
In the interim- assign a windows hotkey to the Windows magnifier. It will pop a vurtual magnifying glass up on your mouse.  hotkey for lens is CTRL-ALT-L if it pops up docked of fullscreen.
---
If you play on a Mac, the solution is to stop overpaying for hype.
---
I'm looking forward to finally using the dog helmet that's been in-game since launch.
---
With the bugged challenges you would net about 250/300.
---
You should look at the list and do some of them. I'm at 13k and already spent over 2k,all free.
---
The 1 second part. Bathesda intended you to be notified. This breaks that.
---
Vanguard works well with Vampire, use a knife with swing speed to really notice a difference
---
I have a friend that was dead set against it, based on it being different and the game news articles trashing it.
---
I bought him a game key and sent it to him.   
---
We play daily.
---
All good point I’ll be more careful in my search criteria 🙂
---
Upvoted.
---
I would just like everyone to remember, this game is competing with peoples emotions and memories of the last games. It’s not actually competing with the game itself. That is a no win situation for anyone who can’t compartmentalize the older games and enjoy what this game does right. 
---
The Same thing is happening with Disney and Star Wars. They’ll never win if they try to compete with nostalgia, they just need to try and make something interesting and unique. 
---
He sounded in his 20’s to be honest. 
---
He kept talking about how he hadn’t been in an adventure server since survival launched. And how he would just keep spawn killing. And how he made 40k caps in the past two days. 
---
Then he goes on to say how he doesn’t like this challenge because he just wants to kill everyone. 
---
I just kept baiting him saying how he was the most bad ass I’ve ever met. 
---
The last thing I heard before we all teleported away was another guy saying “ 500 cap bonus if you kill that guy on your way back “
---
Well, some of us wanted Borderlands style co-op Fallout 4. 
---
This is a lag/ping/comp (or console issue). The server sees you as being there but your computer has not caught on as fast. Other player doesn't have that issue as much because their world is already loaded. This isn't an exploit, just the nature of multiplayer games. Hopefully Bethesda will extend the immunity timer out some more to minimize this issue. Until then, stop fast traveling to the same station over and over again.
---
I have a windmill, seems to work just fine.
---
They probably removed ‘don’t be evil’ because it was just silly from the start.
---
Yeah, I know from a high-level that there are diminishing returns to anti-armor effects, so the order really does matter here.
---
Wisely or not, I tend to find that if I'm using an Anti-Armor weapon, which does 50%, I just don't use anti-armor perks and favor damage increasing perks instead.
---
It could be the "take a penny, leave a penny" box
---
Interesting suggestion.
---
Fair enough
---
It's 1 or 2+ there's nothing after that one
---
I learned fast to never go to train stations. I'd rather walk for 15 minutes just get shot before my screen loads.
---
My GT is Salem LXII, I should be on around 2-2:30
---
It goes down like 8 or 10 points. But it kicks like a thousand donkeys
---
And now I also want my next toon to be Rincewind lol
---
Cool. I should be on then.
---
Believe it is considered hip fire.
---
They don't disappear, they fly. I had one land inside a 4th floor balcony with no stair access. I spent 10 minutes hopping up to it for a 2* life saving leather chest.
---
I recently got the game and I agree. The bad reviews made me want to hold off and I just recently got the game really cheap. 
---
I'm loving it so far. Been playing with a friend and we're having a great time. I can see some people's gripes about no NPCs but it makes sense with the story. But in the end.. it's still Fallout. 
---
OWO..are...are you that someone?
---
3. TS Lever action (main), Quad Pipe Bolt Action (I use it in low level areas and if I'm farming and don't want to waste .45 rounds) and a AA Dragon (I use this as a starting blast against SB, MQ, DC etc).
---
Also fix the long single windows in the brick set. You can phase through them.
---
As someone who has not engaged in PVP play at all, I’m curious to hear thoughts on this. And maybe I need to get with it and start killing some people.
---
I created a new character for survival, and it's definitely tough.  Everyone is shooting.  I am just trying to survive, and don't just shoot anyone and everyone.  If you're on Pc and find Mister Reee, if you're weapon is holstered, or you are engaged in a fight, I won't attack. 
---
Human i can understand, but i wanted to see all sorts of intelligent, though sterile, mutation variations. Just from the pressence of more mutations, there'd likely be a morlock type community hidden somewhere, maybe one of the vaults. There should always be a ghoul community, from underworld, to necropolis, but they went with leading us to believe every sentient ghoul was exterminated by some wack job? I don't buy it. Theyre should also be less mutated mutants in Huntersville, maybe Harold 2.0 as they've been exposed at low doses. 
---
Storytelling opportunities missed left right and center. 
---
Pvp is actually a cap siphon. Everytime you die, you loose 2xlvl in caps and your killer gets 1xlvl in caps. The other half disappears in a poof of logic. Thus, the more people pvp, the less caps are in circulation and the LOWER prices will get with time. Additionally, as you said, caps can become concentrated in the hands of a few, but that doesn't mean they will automatically pay more for items. If fewer people have the amount of caps to purchase an item, then those that do will pay less because their is less competition for purchase.
---
Hah you might be right. I’ll admit, if they did that it’d look/be pretty cool... but the reality is that reality is nothing like the movies. There’s no outrunning explosions, of ANY sort. One of the dumbest things you see in any action movie. Explosions are FAST. You’re lucky if you have time to close your eyes; you sure ain’t moving anywhere. 
---
- closed
---
Stop fast traveling to trainstations. Add 2 caps of your own to that, and you'll have, well, 2 caps.
---
The sbq just feels like a chore to me now.  It just isn't that fun shooting a couple thousand bullets into a bullet sponge for little to no reward.
---
No way in hell. Homeless people pee down slides. 
---
Low level twinks will be the meta if the absurd cap drop rate for higher levels isn't changed.   Never before have I been interested in a level 15 bloodied handmade but times have changed.   Good news is, think gear wasn't duped.  So yeah, I honestly think this will be the PvP meta if changes arent made.  However, it's to soon to assume what will happen after this beta.
---
The best banjo songs are short to non existant
---
Only one I know of was from the movie deliverance. 
---
This made me legitimately laugh out loud 
---
 Big bend tunnel, with nuke mines at each end. 
---
I know, I was peeing as I feel in 😑
---
Pretty much time to retire. ;) Go out on a high note!
---
I don’t like where this conversation is going....
---
Yup this happened to me as well, level 192, just wanted caps from me, as soon as he contested the workshop I left, I blueprint the basic, move to another server .. people will do this as it is the only pvp they will be able to get on these servers, so it is fine, quick and easy to move to another server, if they follow you just block them.
---
I'll take it, but please clarify what you mean by **1000+5mm ammo**
---
Do you mean a couple thousand 5mm ammo or do you mean 1000 caps +5mm ammo?  I can do either one.
---
I'll be on tonight after 8pm EDT.  My tag is OGREGEV
---
Instead of waiting on Devs to adapt, you should instead (only for the time being). There are many easy ways around this since your atoms are shared by ALL characters. Make a new character and transfer over the alcohol from your old char to your new one (this can be done with friends) or even easier, just find some in the starting zone, get wasted, and then level up 3 times. Yeah, it's inconvenient, but there are many ways around most BS challenges and mechanics of this game.
---
One of the main selling points of the game from early on was that nobody could kill you and take your best equipment. That shouldn't change just because Survival is more intensely PvP-oriented.
---
Are legendaries hard to counter? Yes, of course. Surely *something* can be done. But this isn't a good solution.
---
Damn good yes keep
---
there could have been a broken and an unbroken window option tattered or not when u build smth new it aint broken at least not the moment u built it. they could also add a feature so that your camp degrades over time so u have to either repair it or let it be as it is where ur build is could also effect that process (mire,...) 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Not terrible. Just depends on what your build perks consist of. With those rolls I'd say, obviously a sneak/sniper/critical build would best serve it. But maybe others might have a better idea.
---
A true gentleman knows how to play the banjo, but doesn't. 
---
I made a post a couple days ago that give good locations to farm legendary loot that I can share with you if you want.
---
I also can't read most of the dirty notes. Thank you OP. I'd prefer to just have cleaner ones vs zoom but you may require a zoom.
---
I agree with this completely.  There gets to be a point, as a high-level player, where you don't have much business in Toxic Valley or the Ash Heap, and that's a shame.  Legendaries from those locations typically don't scale to you, neither do events, and the game never throws anything difficult your way.
---
At the same time, whenever you look at the map, you don't tend to see players hanging out in the Mire or non-Watoga portions of Cranberry Bog unless they are there for an Event.  The Mire has so little going on - enemy encounters are very infrequent, so it's not an efficient place for leveling or Legendaries.  And the Cranberry Bog is almost as vacant, except with more Scorchbeasts.  The Savage Divide has a better balance, but man, that reddish hue and the sameyness of that region really starts to annoy you after a while.
---
I love being able to shoot out of them, especially the half walls. I have camps built entirely around that functionality. I hope they never "fix" this!
---
Hands out only please, advice not wanted. 
---
This has been true since the BETA, but I've never known if it was intentional to keep people from moving CAMP repeatedly or a bug.  After moving a max-budget camp for 40 caps, the next move in that play session will cost 160 caps.  The cap cost seems to increase 4x no matter what; if my camp budget isn't maxed and the cost to move camp is, say, 20 caps, then the move after that will cost 80 caps.  
---
Is it a bug or a feature?  :D
---
No, if you're level 300, the level 40 that kills you gets 600 of **your** caps.
---
Yeah, I'm still trying to get the Ultra-Light mods on my legs but there's just no way to tell which one is which so I keep getting the chest one.
---
Haha that'll make things interesting because isnt it only 2 minutes before you teleport. Cranberry shine at least lasted for 5 minutes
---
What helps a lot is the glitch where you put pylons on mats or conduits on signs. This way you can move the power source wherever you want, hook that source up to a switch, and then the switch to a door. If you have a switch inside and one outside, it can look a little sloppy even when wired well, but it should all work 
---
I'm saying your complaints are pretty speculative, anticipating a problem that might not even be a problem. If you're in adventure then the problem you're talking about isn't really a problem. If you're in survival, you get some invulnerability (though not working great now I believe they'll fix it) when you spawn in, and you can duck and cover and smash the turret base, or just run away
---
I might take up your offer later today if available. This isn't my primary weapon by far, kinda lives in the stash box until I want to have fun.
---
That one is rly good, keep it
---
After some looking around, it appears the game applies the DR perks from highest to lowest. So 50% AA first, then 36% antitank perk, etc.
---
I have consistently been +1000 caps a day and haven't even tried … it is just a result of playing.
---
I imagine those that go Chameleon/Tesla (invisible/fast and not VATS targetable) with any amount of skill could easily do 15:1 kills. Not to mention the spawn-pussies.
---
Sweet. I played for 13 hours yesterday and got nothing really good. Just logged on today on Watoga and found 3* protectron. 
---
Funny how that works....
---
Haha very nice. I had one so violent it caused an error and shut down the game
---
Ye i finished 
---
Well items in containers should  count to being wanted. World items just sitting around should count to it. However I think Bethesda might not have a way to differentiate. 
---
Here's another tip, when you search something game related. Go directly to the subreddit here and use the search on the right side. Chances are very high it has already been discussed here. If you start your search directly from the subreddits page, you automatically search only in the sub, not in all of reddit.
---
So if you wanna look up locations where to find thistles to brew Oak Holler Lager, just type "thistle" into the search bar and you have the thread. Sort for new and you're all set.
---
I'm lvl 70 and carry a shotgun, sniper rifle, blade of bastet (for high armor enemies) and an electrified revolution sword for main melee. 
---
I probably could drop one of the swords but I like having the option to do in robots and such without wasting bullets or having it take forever
---
I've naturally become a kinda rifle/melee build.  My standard loadout is:
---
1 x Lever Rifle for long range
---
1 x Handmade for medium range
---
1 x Anti-Armour Grognak's Axe for close quarters.
---
I do love a modded baseball bat, though.  I also quite like having a play with wepaons I pick up along the way, just to see how they feel.
---
Any grenades I pick up often get used quite quickly!
---
Please don't stop now bb, show me your feet ?
---
I have started doing the same thing for low level legendary items.  I like putting them in trash bins.  Does anyone know how long dropped items in bags stay?
---
I said the same thing and one of the Bethesda people in here said they would pass it along or something. Really hope they fix them.
---
Yeah, diminishing returns so having a mix would *probably* be better, but I don't have the ability to confirm since we are speaking in generalities.
---
Gunpowder for me. 
---
Camp options are overall lacking, they should at least bring back all the parts from fallout 4+dlc but there is so much the could add like rounded walls, smaller walls(half the size we have now), concrete building set, glass house building set, glas walls in general to get that nice 50s feeling of modern architecture, different and more pillars, staits etc. 
---
Well, after i picked (clicked on) my fast travel destination it took me about 1-2 seconds until i'm loaded in. So i guess the immunity timer is broken for me, because i cant imagine the timer should only last that long.
---
Bloodied builds are all below 40% of health, so Executioner is most useful as an anti-bloodied weapon, but will also cut down the time to bring down larger enemies (Deathclaws, Mirelurk Queens, Scorchbeasts). It's a sniper rifle, so 15% faster reload is great. And it's explosive, which is OK, but will mean less and less in PvP when more people will figure out the mods and perks to counter it.
---
IMO, an OK PvP weapon, great PvE weapon (with appropriate perks).
---
That's awesome. Ran into a group of guys behind top other day and they had a weird little setup. It was all those pipboy cardboard cutouts where he stands and points. They had those in a circle and they're all standing in the middle of it. I ran in there but noone had a mic. It might have been a ladyboy meetup
---
It's actually really rare to get anything really good. Most people get their top tier stuff by buying and trading for it. What in particular are you looking for?
---
Ahh sorry had to write the post 4 times cause the "reddit rules".......Im on PC 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/zWsPrXG
---
Oh you're right, I forgot that one existed. Sadly I think it's the only one, and is just the quest reward for Officer On Deck.
---
Great tip I’ve never done that, I’m going to have a good old search 👍
---
I’m usually overburdened or with legendary dysentery or both!
---
So usually drinking lots of water.
---
How is this griefing? They just want to pvp. If you had been the workshop owner then you had agreed to pvp and they are right to kill you. Since you were not the workshop owner nothing happened and they wasted a bit of time. You took no damage from this and went on your way. So why are you accusing random strangers of griefing.
---
You didn't get the wanted from taking the stuff.  You got the wanted from picking the lock.  The stuff inside was instanced, but the lock was not.
---
Yeah, I'm skipping those, my ATOM income dropped significantly with the release of the alcohol ones.
---
honestly i don't think anyone would question a deathclaw suit
---
Do you want your switch on the inside / outside / both?
---
The outside (toggle) switch is easy. The switch has to be between the door and power supply. 
---
The inside switch works the same. I had to run wires in and out of my windows. 
---
Basic setup is (power, toggle switch, door). 
---
If you want a switch on both sides. That is a bit of a trick. You’ll have to build a logic gate. Check the FO4 videos. Few good ones out there. 
---
I opted for an inside switch only. 
---
I also think a lot if people expected a super polished title at release not understanding that being polished is impossible for an MMO as you can’t beta with hundreds of thousands of people.  Problems arise when you go live regardless of who made the game.  The fact that Bethesda made this and that most of their releases have had rough starts seems to have been forgotten by that crowd. 
---
I dropoff those kindof items in the overseers camp. Hopefully someone finds it and makes use of it
---
Okay ty
---
Most nukes I've seen dropped on WS lately miss half the cobalt and crimson because they dropped it too far southwest. Most of the good stuff is outside the wall to the north and east and people don't drop it there for some reason. Not sure if their goal is to get the 3 star in the watch tower in the zone or what.
---
You roasted the game so hard that it burned to death.
---
Great explanation. Nice to finally get decent weapon
---
How about a trade?  I have a full set of Ultracite armor that I found.  I need the low level excavator, but not the ultracite.  My game tag is OGREGEV and I'll be on tonight after 8pm EDT
---
Problem is, they are bugged so I can’t get a thing from them, completion is impossible until it’s fixed 
---
Understandable. Sorry but I can’t help you, I’m on Xbox.
---
Nice! Was this on PS4? Bloodied sniper build looks pretty solid, how come you don't use vats headshots?
---
"from FO76"
---
It's a rather appealing shape.  I always struggle with roofs that aren't even-numbered, because there aren't any roof pieces with the proper trim.  Your steeple there - I wish we didn't have to do funky interior walls to achieve slanted roofs that flow into walls, if that makes sense.  The game always considers that "floating," and I don't see why it's a problem.
---
tbh on my screen is shows the top 3 but not anywhere on the map, can someone explain this to me? an I doing something wrong
---
I’m surprised anyone would have that problem, especially if they got these atoms for free, but then it comes down to personal taste doesn’t it? Personally I like a lot of the building items and some of the skins.
---
No prob, thx for asking!
---
Wow that's a pretty nice looking camp for having only played a week, well done! :) I haven't even found the Nuka Cola plan yet and I'm lvl 65. 
---
What level are you now after one week?
---
Mmmmm yes drama.
---
I’m OK with the atom shop but make the damn items worthwhile.  I need a flower pot or statue like I need a hole in the head. 
---
If you won’t drop true legendary stuff then at least put some out for atom purchases and no the vendor shops don’t count.   
---
+karma 
---
That's what I do with low level stuff I'm not going to use. Going to a vendor to get a whole 4 caps isn't worth it, and spending days looking for buyer that wants it for a low level alt is annoying. I usually just advertise it on r/fo76FilthyCausal and offer it up any player that's level appropriate to use it. 
---
But that helps keep your armor values up, I would like to see them add something that increases weapon damage with the higher your health, like how bloodied increases as your health goes down and so does bolstering for your armor
---
L2, 
---
 I'll just have to remember to unequip grenade/mine first...or I'd be trying to turn myself into a bloody mess...

Fixed glass for warehouse and barn  windows, and actual  glass panes for the  frames in  brick  walls  please.  This  is unacceptable.

---
From my understanding, at most trainstops there are specific blue suitcases which don't reset their items and are quasi-shared. If you dump all your spare items into these blue suitcases it's easy to be accessed by other players -- they don't have individual inventories so they won't reset when a player checks them out and wipe the contents (unlike things like lunchboxes or cash registers).
---
Yeah, I had exactly the same issue with the roof trim! Haha. Thankfully, once I found the steeple piece, it all kind of panned out. 
---
The queen. Run high luck (unyielding armor sets, chems, food, alcohol with happy go lucky). Best I've got off her was assassin's explosive with 90% weight reduce dragon and a few serum recipes. Used to be whitesprings had good drops. It still has quantity if your saving them for the legendary vendor.
---
Don't listen to youtubers who are so stuck in their builds too. Basically youtubers fail that's why they're youtubers.
---
I'll be around at 6:30 eastern 
---
Well I’ll give you 5 caps but your gonna have to do some work behind the red rocket if you know what I mean..wink wink
---
Yeah it doesn't. The hard lemonade is probably the best of the lot. 10 minutes and quite easy to craft.  
---
Nukashine might be good for an unarmed build fighting the queen,but you have to consider the time it takes to travel back to the event.
---
I only make the ones needed for the challenges but would never try and farm to make it a permanent bonus.
---
PLUS everything is in black and white while you're on Nukashine. Adds a little bit more difficulty. 
---
Y'know, if you have the space and you're melee, I might hold onto it.  I've been holding onto 3\* stuff in general, unless it's a heavy weapon.  Two of the big questions I have about the upcoming Legendary Vendor is whether or not A: we can scrap Legendaries to learn mods and B: we can pay to upgrade Legendaries to a level appropriate for our character.  Until we get some clarity on that, I'd feel like I might regret getting rid of these things.
---
Server stopped responding and kicked you
---
-the most FO76 thing about all of this lol

And for every 1000 caps transfered to you, a 1000 caps are destroyed. It doesn't matter how the caps get redistributed among the players. Before pvp Bethesda just let the caps expand and expand and expand. People would fill up mules with caps. Now they are taking a 50% rake on all pvp. 
---
You cant because their inventory is tied to the CAMP owners stash
---
How bout making the railway rifle work with literally any perks? Even concentrated fire, a non weapon type specific perk, doesn’t work with it.
---
It can drop in survival if you kill someone I got 10 stealth boys off a person this morning
---
Okay thanks but why not be able to build them at workshops 
---
At least they left you your sense of entitlement. Stay golden, ponyboy.
---
Ill be on around 5 or 6 hours from now.
---
Especially the New Vegas worshippers. Good lord that was a bug riddled mess.
---
Wow just got another 3* instigating submachine gun
---
Double damage is full health
---
15% faster reload
---
33% in vats
---
&gt; How fast can you reset the robots in fertile soil.
---
I've made that into a personal challenge since the event pops up so often. My current record is 1:48 using speed demon, marathoner, gun runner, and the nukashine sprinting AP buff to increase my movement speed at less AP cost.
---
Cheers! Made it to 20. Though I've played a fairly unhealthy amount this week. 😅 Some sort of build is starting to take shape. Lots of alcohol and team support. Not to mention a pretty hefty sawn-off shotgun. 
---
If I could remember where on earth I found the plans, I'd let you know. 
---
well i dont understand then the chances that i get put in that guys server are slim to none how do i play?
---
What's the gimp suit you're wearing?
---
Except that wasn't what was planned or announced at E3. 
---
No. They get 300. You lose 600.
---
They were exploiting the workshop contesting system, they only contest it for 1 second before stopping, which breaks the notification of being attacked. They are waiting for him to leave before shooting him down. So, therefore, it's griefing as the griefers were exploiting mechanics to get caps and junk off of them. They don't even want the workshops.
---
Well if someone takes the workshop from you and you have stuff in the fermenter, they wouldn't be able to use it because its linked to your stash
---
I have enough points in the bank to spec however I want whenever I want. No need for an alt if you want to redo your perk loadout, just grind high level areas and keep leveling up .
---
Reassign those buttons to letters you never press then keybind stuff to those letters. That's what I always do anyway when this problem occurs.
---
What did i just tell you? There are maybe 6 of them bugged and they amass to 300 atoms.  The rest of them is worth well over 15k. If you don't want to do them,it's fine.
---
Once above level 60-70 your level is completely irrelevant so I don't think levelling the servers will make any difference. The reason you will get one shotted by higher levels is their build and gear. If they've got a bloodeied rifle or melee build with sentinel/unyeeilding armor they can murder everyone at any level over 50 unless people know how to deal with them using crits and staggers. Any kind of matchmaking would have to be really smart and be based on player skill metrics or their build/gear setup.
---
I got most of my stuff from farming whitesprings way back when. Got good hauling legendaries that were really good in terms of effects for me(+ap regen, food weapon and water weight reduction, 2 regenerating with healing factor). It took me a good month or so of constantly server hopping, as well as reseting nuke zones(something no longer possible to my knowledge). 
---
Guess my best advice would be to stay persistent. Really are just plaging the odds and theyre really stacked against you.
---
Both of my tse's were traded though. Id get a good weapon build before grinding too hard for legendaries, as it makes it much easier.
---
No you actually get 600.
---
I got a dinner fork once. 
---
Have you played survival?
---
Pro tip: caps can be exchanged for goods and services
---
Uncanny Caverns!  Don't forget to buy the upgraded tour package!
---
That sounds like fun. too bad about the server disconnect though. 
---
I agree and appreciate you explaining why it is you feel like this, in an 'unentitled' and nonaggressive way.
---
For me the limited time windows and imited availability don't make me want to buy atoms. They make me check the price of atoms and decide, ultimately, I didn't really want that stuff anyway.
---
Sure, thanks!
---
Hey man, you should be happy! This is a f2p ga...wait..it is f2p right?
---
The worst part is when you've already committed to your melee swing when their "Legendary" nameplate pops up.
---
In some ways, I almost don't mind this mechanic, because it forces me to back off and start shooting instead of blindly stabbing everything.  But hunting down the corpse is a big nuisance, if it's even still there.
---
I thought sickleman deemed it that?
---
and have doors properly hang in the door frame.
---
and items properly place on the tables without jumping into a floor or roof tile above and when I have to replace the tile it gets deleted not stored and I have to rebuild just to place one of the 50 lights I'm allowed to use ....
---
totally would be game changing to add a wedge piece in foundation, ceiling and roof to allow for actual circular builds. along with 1/2 and 1/4 scaled assets as well for building architectural structures realistically found. 
---
I'm aware all these fixed and or clean versions of stuff are available in other fallout docs and Bethesda said all dlcs are free yet SO far those floors and doors etc etc for camp ...are all atom store stuff.  that isn't free dlc with more assets for builders.
---
classic case of "mad cuz bad"
---
*REEEEEEEEEEEEE*
---
Best suggestion I've seen since this game's launch.
---
I'm level 90 and needing a new objective in the game.
---
Happy to help you out and hopefully do some of the events I didn't do the first time around.
---
Will add you when I'm next online.
---
Right! I’m not taking it seriously by any means. The recent update’s drinking challenges are just a little excessive in my opinion. Alcoholism just hits a little closer to home for me than say, cannibalism or nuclear annihilation. 
---
Well that's what they get! 😂
---
Okay thank you. 
---
Tyvm for the service and  for the attention! It is good to see our questions replied.
---
Holy shit is it slow though. Maybe my problem is I just don’t have the right weapon for the job. I use an executioner’s explosive radium rifle, but many of the high level mobs(ghouls aside) take upwards of a dozen shots to kill, and 1/3 are crits.
---
The fastest XP route I’ve found is in the ash heap because Glow Sights allows me to do substantially more damage, but the loot there is very meh.
---
Everything, my current outfit is not very good, the only good weapon that I have is a legendary baseball bat that ignore 50% of the armor makes 40% more damage with heavy attack and has +1 End.
---
Besides that is all useless. 
---
This is so true I have been shafted by lvl 40 legendaries more than a few times. Doesn't something similar happen with super mutants too? 
---
Apologies, I misread what you typed, I want to do them of course as I have no desire to put money into this game however a lot of them are tedious and require time to do, a lot of playing until you eventually get atoms.
---
Yea, its frustrating as hell.   I used to cap the workshops when ever i log on.  I don't even bother anymore, tired of doing all the work to claim and build it up just to have the server stop responding boot me (and everyone else im with) and we have to start over again.
---
I am a Fallout fan...I bought fo76 on pre order and returned it while it was still in pre order...I just had a bad feeling about how happy I would be with the game given the many games that were coming out basically unfinished...and I also knew Bethesdas modus operandi was this very approach. I also do not like the way the devs have conducted themselves in many situations since release...but I do believe the community has been vocal and holding the devs to a better standard than where they were at.
---
I believe I have done the right thing until now by not rewarding the company with my hard earned cash and using my little bit of influence in all this to let them know I expect them to be good stewards of gaming....but now I feel good about giving this game a try despite my negative experiences with MMOs...because overall, I believe Bethesda can make a good game and overall does listen to its very passionate community in ways other devs lack....thinking of the modding community that has been allowed and encouraged to flourish in paticular.
---
This weekend will be the first time I will play...and right now I have zero expectations...just the feeling that it is now time to step up and support Bethesda...which I am now willing to do.
---
Aside: As a result of how fo76 rolled out I no longer buy games on pre order...I watch Twitch, YouTube, read reviews from lone reviewers to large gaming reviewers and only then am I willing to consider rewarding a company with my cash.
---
Come shoot me a few times with your hardest gun and I guarantee it will work.
---
The only thing that sucks with it is that it's a submachine gun. The first bullet is the only one that gets the +100% damage, and base damage of a single bullet from an automatic sucks. :/ Now, a furious submachine gun on the other hand (or one with crit damage, as rumors say that some of the bullets from an automatic when you're outside of VATS will count as critical strikes). Keep it for the future legendary vendor though!
---
That is utterly irrelevant. We knew fallout would be continued after 4. We all had our own ideas of what we would like to have. E3 announcement came much much later than that.
---
Yes, the game discourages leveling like this because you would have to kill the level 50 5 times to make up for 1 of the 250’s deaths.
---
And now you see why there is so many level 50s running around.
---
you one hit everything, only another player is going to get in enough damage. 
---
Yeah. I feel no incentive to put more money in the game, considering how expensive the Atom Store is.
---
Hoping you get some clear definitive answers as I am curious about these god mode players to.
---
Pve can do 6k a day with 2-3 hours of farming on one character. If you have a alt, possible to do 10 a day like pvp. Not as fun and a lot of repetitive stuff, but that's farm life. I don't care much for the vendor pool being put in one spot in the next update. Lower levels will have a much easier time getting the caps. Inflation.
---
I bet you could get at least 14k and probably more for it
---
Us-"Looks like 5 more years until a new fallout" Bethesda at E3"Wrong! " ****Hype!**** Followed by youtube-"So Fallout 5!? " Everyone -"No, that's not possible" YT streamers-"Then I hate it and so should you"
---
Yes but you can’t do that in this game, pvp or not. Well, you could, but then EVERYONE’S game would slow time/freeze anytime anyone on the server used VATS. 
---
I pre-ordered and pre-purchased this game, power armor edition even.  Right now, it's not the game I want to play. But I'm hopeful that in the future it will be. At the moment, the camp limitations are pretty annoying, the loot drop rate seems to be an issue, and servers are a bit unstable. I was under no assumption that the game would be perfect right off the bat. ESO kinda had that same feeling. I'm sure that eventually it'll have features i'm interested in and when it does i'll make a return. 
---
This wouldn't all be a problem anyway if there weren't time-limited items on the shop, which is obviously what they were going for there. You could hypothetically have saved up a bunch of atoms from doing challenges all the while and have more than enough for anything, but I'm guessing most people probably haven't done that so when multiple time-gated items are released back to back it ups the incentive to just buy some atoms.
---
Grogaxe, war drum, .308 silenced, shotgun, 10mm SMG.
---
I know the first two aren't guns, but I'll be damned if I don't try to reload the sons of bitches every other fight. I just hit Lvl118 yesterday you'd think I'd have that figured out by now😞
---
DOWN WITH THE BOTS!!!!
---
SAVE OUR JOBS!
---
A dozen guys is how an organization starts 
---
People always talk about these amazing experiences...and I get griefers :/
---
I've never had a good experience with another player past a little wave and they move on. That's about the only good experience...the rest is just assholes trying to troll me.
---
We live in a world in which you can get an artificial heart, edible under garments, and cheese in a can yet that would slow the entire server ? 
---
I was commenting on the guy that was uses levels matter arguement
---
I have 20/20 with my glasses on and I can't read them either!
---
Is that the place where the paintings rotate on the walls and stuff?
---
Man, I'd be too busy laughing to be mad about getting killed by a protest sign. 😂
---
This seems to be a new trend for developers that don't want another dime from me: macrotransactions!
---
I’ve found myself missing in PvP with 95%, a LOT. I assumed it’s just tunes down somehow.
---
&gt; And I'm not a commy, but I see where they're coming from 
---
Well good now that we got that out of the way. 
---
I'm impressed you are able to kill other players with those signs though, I'd love to watch. Just make sure you don't pull a Jimmy and go flow blown commie.
---
West Tek is a great place to level up, high level super mutants and loot to replace your ammo along with a high chance of legendaries. 
---
Uh oh. We've already lost one to the sound
---
What platform? I have a 2* Unyielding Marine  chest for sale
---
Lol.  The fallout equivalent of someone following you in a parking lot in order to get your parking spot only to find that you aren't parked in the lot and are simply cutting across it.
---
I'm surprised you can't make them at workshops as essentially they are no different to your stash box and in actual fact fermenting items are still visible in your stash box they are just set to fermenting mode by the fermenter.
---
I’d buy it
---
Lvl95, tried to launch a nuke once at 70, but then it crashed and had to find new cards. Which is a pain so still following the overseeer. I lack quests though. I'm really bored in the game.
---
You broke the first rule! 
---
At least they aren't claiming Bethesda colluded with Russia while developing Fo76....yet.
---
That's funny!
---
PS4, but I’m very short on caps, I spend everything on schematics for the CAMP. 
---
Did it give you options to revive at places other than your CAMP or death location? I never could understand why Bethesda limited those. If they are slamming you at the train station, you could just respawn near by and they won't know which direction you are coming from.
---
Just look through the perk cards and you can theory craft what people are running. Most likely Dodgy, Serendipity, fireproof, blocker, etc.
---
Wow! commenter deleted comments AND account, hope they are ok ☹️
---
Get it electric serrated and use as an awesome leveling melee
---
Double damage @ full health is an instigating sword.  
---
If you have the other melee swing speed perks and incisor, could make it a fast weapon with high damage....
---
I wouldn't discount it - at the moment, my goto in a nuke zone is a lowly L15 vampire machete - base damage around 50, but w/ cited perks, T60 PA + the machete, no worries taking on the groups of 5 glowing ones.  
---
Granted, the legendary takes a bunch of hits, but it does work.
---
Have also taken out more than one L42 Wendogo with it.
---
Perhaps the biggest surprise was taking out a L30 Sentrybot.  In so close, the Sentrybot apparently could not target me, so amazingly, I came out damage free.  It was quite amusing watching the pieces fly off of it every time I hit.
---
I'm a little over level 200.
---
1. All-Rise (Super Sledge)
---
* 90% reduced weight
---
* 30 Health
---
2. Zealot's Super Sledge
---
* +30% damage to scorched
---
3. Explosive Western Revolver (Level 40)
---
* +10 damage to players
---
* Bullet explode for area damage
---
* +1 agility
---
4. Two-Shot Explosive Black Powder Pistol (Level 30)
---
* Shoots an additional projectile
---
Yeah, I've been a bit unlucky when it comes to legendary drops.
---
The reason I have so few weapons and multiple of the same type is because I feel I need all the damage increasing perks for the weapon to be at least decent toward high level enemies. As the current perk system currently is, I have limited points to use and I would have to sacrifice other important perk cards.
---
I kinda prefer having different types of weapons on me as the variety is more fun, which is something you can have at a low level without much problems.
---
Yeah exactly. But idk lol. 
---
Some higher damage pistols for end game would be nice to see now, something along the lines of a .50 caliber Desert Eagle, or a 500 Magnum revolver.
---
Also, allowing legendary rewards from quests (looking at you Somerset Special) to scale with level would be nice as well.
---
I guess I just don't pay attention to them.  I would enjoy doing more challenges with Biv though.  I find that a creative and enjoyable addition to the wasteland... "I blew out my flip flop, Stepped on a pop top, Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home"
---
That is exactly the place where it takes a dozen shots to kill one guy. It takes way too long to efficiently clear it. 
---
That’s not hardened. 
---
You just have to rethink your strategy a little.  Take out 1 Stimpak and store all other aid and junk.  Move your CAMP to a player hotspot.  Build a floor with a wall attached.  Place a chair on the floor with your stash next to it.  Put "Free Aid" on the wall and sit in the chair.  It's like you're a Responder vending machine!  Replenish your Stimpak from your stash after you die and repeat.
---
Really what needs to be added is aid syringer ammo. Or a aid grenades.  Can you imagine running around shooting people with Stimpaks and RadAways?  Throw a StimPak grenade into a heated battle and heal everyone. 
---
Look for an event called uranium fever.  You get at least a tier 2 or 3 legendary weapon.  Got a tier 3 bloodied 50 cal from it
---
Spawn-Pussies, great band name 🤘🏼
---
Hrm. Didn't mean to make the poor guy leave. 🤔
---
That would mean Dense and Padded reudce incoming damage by a flat % of max incoming damage, but is applied after Fireproof.  I might have to do some testing with Dense by itself, and then again with Fireproof 1 &amp; 2 to get the exact amount for Dense.
---
That said a minium % for Dense would need to be 55%.  Using a Crag as an example: the formula should look like:
---
150 \* 0.55(Fireproof) - 150 \* 0.55(Dense) = 0
---
As another example, assuming Dense is 60%, it would be:
---
150 \* 0.55(Fireproof) - 150 \* 0.6(Dense) = -7.5 or 0 because you can't take negative damage.
---
Honestly, it seems like oversight to have it reduce damage by a flat % incoming damage, as it completely nullifies a form of damage in the game.   If it were just a high % reduction, like 90%, a 150 damage Crag would still deal 8 damage; with the change to PVP in Adventure, the fear of TSE's should be completely gone, so there shouldn't be a reason for Dense to work the way it does right now.  And TSE weapons dealing an effective 5.5% of their explosive damage, won't make much of a difference for the hardcore PVP builds in Survival.  Notice that anyone who doesn't have a hardcore PVP build still dies nearly instantly to TSE as of now in Survival.
---
I collected all those signs. I like to wander around events carrying them.
---
be the change you want to see in the world..or some bullshit like that.
---
How do people troll you, I guess I've been lucky enough to avoid it thus far so I don't know what the common trolls are. 
---
I’m doing also that. 
---
Usually my farming route is this:
---
- Watoga Emergency Service
---
-RobCo Research Center
---
-Monster Smash Event
---
- Uranium Fever Event
---
- Hordes Event
---
-Whitespring
---
Start with the "kill scorched with this or that".
---
Do runs between morgantown airport and the town of the mothman museum.
---
Those are easy,quite fast and worth 80 each.
---
Thanks! They made some small improvements with lighting costs which does help!
---
I'm on PS4 as well. I sell it for 2k if you're ever interested.
---
Doesn't make sense.  
---
I can just stay for an hour on my Camp made in a cave with the only entrance closed with indestructible foundation.  
---
So based on your experience, it works only for armor, but doesn't proc in PA?
---
If you just play casually you can get about a level an hour, if you are trying to grind levels you can do it in half that time or even less. Playing 4-5 hour I can go up 5-6 levels and that’s without level grinding. You can’t expect to hit level 50+ in a few days of playing. Just enjoy the game
---
Do you mean 6K without using the player market as an income source? That is all just 'in game' farming (vendor sales/cap stashes)?
---
Not PC, but good luck to you!
---
Three stars AND not WOOD.
---
EVERY DAMN TIME it's Wood Armor.  RNG gods hate me :(
---
We should be able to build them unbroken, but allow them to be broken. They did it with the fasnacht balloons, so the tech is there in the game. You can pop them, then repair them.
---
Just imagine how cool it'd be if you're standing by the stove, cooking some deathclaw meat when you hear a pop and a shatter. You smash the nearby window and fire a few shots at the supermutants who are trying to break in.
---
Yeah that always gets me. I kill one guy and the stealth boy Tesla rifle teammate makes a beeline straight towards me and lights up the tree I am hiding in.
---
I got wanted for 769 caps and decided to camp the Watoga train station. I eventually hid inside the high school ambushing people as they entered. Eventually, two teams showed up and had an epic battle outside. I made my way to the roof and started picking off both sides. Eventually people were spawning with zero caps on them. I fast traveled away to a trap workshop I owned and got killed by a level 70 who was able to walk through walls. I guess the building I made to trap my fast travel map did not load in for him. I made 3k caps with that 769 cap bounty.
---
I never had so much caps in one time since D1. 🤣
---
Do you have enough agility to get some ranks in stealth?
---
There’s an older post detailing it called “a secret in plain sight” maybe OP can link to it.
---
instigating weapons are particularly helpful for low levels, so I’d personally find a level 10-20 player somewhere and drop it for them. More satisfying than dropping it in a cache and hoping maybe someone finds it. :)
---
Ah ok I see now. I was under the impression that workshop PVP can only happen within the boundaries of the workshop itself. I admit that's a pretty lame tactic. And for what? Some caps? 😂
---
I’ll try and update with more when I get home. I still need some more decorative items on the dock :)
---
They took our juuuuuuurbs
---
Yeah we don't need to turn this sub into a political discussion.
---
Does the other player really have any way of knowing that you're in a loading screen, unless they're stream sniping you? People take different amounts of time to load in.
---
every bethesda game needs this fix. 
---
buy it from watoga for 1.2k caps
---
I carry a small arsenal of 10-15 3 star bloodied guns. I have 385 max carry weight in regular armor so I’m fine, no hoarding problems here, nope.
---
I was in a similar situation where I had tried to use melee and rifles in my build. I got away with it because of TSE but once that was nerfed I had to respec to pure rifles and now I do great damage. You could put your build on https://nukesdragons.com to share it here or give a summary of perks and you have. Then say what sort of build you are looking to focus on - rifles, shotguns, 2H melee etc. I'll admit it was easier to respec at level 80 when you could get so much XP from the green blobby nuka-zombies.
---
you noob then
---
I'm using my first character more for crafting/repairing and feeding meds to my alt.   
---
Kind of a pain given the lack of shared storage, but make it work. Luckily with the perks that allow the over 100% repair I don't have to trade items back n forth too much. Not at 50 on the second character so most the time I scrap the broken and dole out the upgrades. 
---
Like you said, completely against the idea of going back and relearning all these plans. Hence my alt having a wee 4x4 one story shack with the basics. If I want a big fancy house let the main deal with it. 
---
One huge benefit is all the knowledge gained from the first character. I've leveled this new one way more logically, already know good places to farm/grind, etc. Allows more time to fully take in the scenery and pick up on the lore. 
---
How was he able to see you on the map?  Were you still in the top 3 after being killed multiple times? 
---
Yeah with the level 48 super mutants
---
I think he read spawn pussies xD Just kidding, he's probably fine, needs to lower his iq a bit before getting on reddit!
---
Id rather get a 3 star wood then a 1 star lead pipe. Atleast i can get something for the wood piece. A 1 star lead pipe is worth what, like 6 caps? Lol. Im not going to get super picky. If i can just get rewards based on that id be happy as hell. Some kind of worth to cover the cost of the risk is what this is all about. 
---
What weapons have you specced into?
---
Found mine in Harper's. Both regularly have them for sale. Be sure to drink a beer and pop a grape mentats before buying and selling though
---
*Disable Legendaries*
---
I've been talking about this with some of the people I play with. Creating a mode where legendaries are disabled would drastically balance things.
---
It would make PA meaningful, get rid of most oneshot builds, and do away with the ridiculous "stand still, jump up and down" combat meta.
---
With legendaries gone, it also wouldn't matter if a weapon was duped or if someone got lucky with RNG. What would matter is who has the smartest perk loadout, who has more supplies to draw from, and who knows how to properly plan.
---
Or at least, that's my perception of it.
---
Agreed
---
600?
---
I mean player market. If you have regular buyers too, the sales of mats is quick.
---
Im thankful we did not get FO5. My best moments with FO4 were aimless exploring and envi. story telling. Quests and npcs were awful.
---
That's just it FONV is still way more buggy than FO76 is...in fact I think FO76, right now,  is more stable than any of the other FO games, at least on PC. 
---
No one expected super polished, we just expected things that were broken 4 years ago to not be broken now. I love FO76 but it had and has some issues that shouldve been fixed forever ago.
---
Based on the game data, serendipity does not work in power armor. Based on my experience in regular armor serendipity has always worked and is an absolute must have for a low health bloodied build, could be effective for full health builds, saving you when shit gets crazy.
---
If it's not sentinel or cavalier it could be your weapon. Someone did an experiment and the damage output in PvP now has lot less to do with what your pip boy says. I think they figured out it always did a certain peragage depending on weapon type.
---
If the rooms are the same layout, it would probably be possible to copy paste your build to a new room if your original is taken.
---
Don’t think Radium rifle rad damage hurts super mutants or ghouls. 
---
Honestly if Bethesda actually follows or reads anything this is it.  It’s all objective and effective feedback on how to improve the Survival mode experience. 
---
I have a scoped 1\* executioner (combat) rifle - it lacks the range of the 308 sniper, but I really like it, expecially from sneak or standard sniping positions - as a semi auto, the follow up shots quickly drop the enemy.
---
Especially useful on a group of mole miners, even in rapid hip fire.
---
I figure the performance of a 308 sniper should be as good - given my non-legendary hardened sniper does 90... 2x/180 on sneak attack... add explosive... I'd got to westek and sit on the hill opposite the parking lot and test it out before selling/dumping it.
---
Still does 70ish per shot and has armor pen from perks, best I got.
---
Seems to be RNG, have not dropped a keeper in quite some time.
---
You are not going crazy bro I notice that too since the last patch!!!
---
If you want to do the whole process of collecting codes you certainly can for the sake of playing as intended, but you can also go to [nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) and get the current working codes for all silos.  They all change once a week, and if you do the same silo more than once in the same week you won't have to re-enter the code (it'll say you already did that part).  You just need a Nuclear Keycard to swipe (and lose) when you finish the final challenge in the silo.  You don't need to have any of the code pieces on you at all.
---
That's how I got my first bounty. It's crappy, but it's the way it is 
---
Well it’s an unmarked location, and it had a thing under the porch saying “sickle man WAS here”, so I assumed it’s just an empty house.
---
Right on. I just don't think you should have to be a merchant to be able to keep up with a faulty game mechanic. If you can earn, say 5K caps a day in PVP there should be a way, even if a little grindy, to earn it in gameplay and \*not\* PVP.
---
I'm not saying they are all winners, I'm saying 2-3 stars drop higher starred weapons than before, which is so key
---
Rifles but not all the way. I have max tank killer, and 30% dmg on top of that one rank in each of the dmg perks. I don’t have the luck one, and rely on critical savvy, grin reaper’s sprint, bloody mess, gun fu, and adrenaline to get the extra dmg.

Got a gold watch from a 3 star, then 10 minutes later an exterminators walking cane.. ohhh happy days ...

Are you on Xbox?

My daily challenges usually consist of 
---
-craft 50 beverages 
---
-level up while intoxicated 5 times
---
-level up 5 times wearing a beer hat
---
-kill ____ 5 times while intoxicated on a recipe I don’t have yet. 
---
The weeklys are just as bad too. RIP my atoms 
---
I hope this is for PS4
---
That’s one positive on alting, you can spend your points in a way that gives you a more or less finished build at 50.
---
Same here.
---
PS4, why?
---
Do you use sneak? My build is rifles but if I didn't utilize sneak I would suck.
---
Nice! Looks real cozy have fun and enjoy adventuring in Appalachia, fellow burgeoning architect!
---
When the youtube sheepherder is telling his flock that the game is terrible, the sheeple tend to listen.
---
 It's a shame people don't know how to think for themselves these days.
---
The other day I started a brand new character and moved all of my stash and inventory over. My original build was level 130 and was garbage.
---
Just wondering. 
---
Game tag is reznorkhan and I’ll be on tonight with my casual group we do nukes and hunt and just play around so feel free to add me and join in.
---
I have max stealth, but pretty quickly they find me because it’s a bunch of shots to kill a dude.
---
This is the argument every single time... People complain about the cost of atoms but do not adjust to the "real" cost by accounting for in game atoms. 
---
I am pretty sure I have accumulated 6 to 7K atoms in game. I currently have 3900 atoms, have purchased several things, and have never bought any. 
---
This is a complaint by people that have to have everything and cannot control their fear of missing out. Quite frankly it is voicing entitlement. They want it all.
---
I was on the fence about multiplayer and wasn't sure about getting FO76, but I couldn't take it a broke down and joined the beta with a week or so to go. I'm sorry I waited that long. I play mostly solo, I'm somewhere north of level 150 with nearly 500 hours in. Almost all of that solo, maybe a dozen hours not. You absolutely can play this alone if you so desire. 
---
This is an issue on all platforms 
---
I have a small PC Discord community if you wanna come join with laid back people.

Will do! Time to get out there and share the outrageous amount of booze I've been brewing. 
---
How much did you play Survival mode? If somebody easily killed you, it's not because he's high level.  
---
I've seen a video of a level 5 without any armor killing a level 76 in 4 shots with a level 1 hunting rifle...  
---
Please tell me this is the guy I traded with on Xbox a few weeks back!  
---
Fun fact, railway rifle benefits from zero combat perks!
---
Pssshhh, a beastly pvp weapon. Many many people run low on hp, and even if not one or two hits would drop most players below 40, making the third hit lethal
---
That’s my take as well.  If Bethesda won’t follow through and eliminate all dupes they could at least disable legendary “stacking” effects that aren’t realistic or enjoyable feature in the first place.  Or just get rid of legendaries altogether. 
---
It would be very discouraging to get one shot by a lvl 20 just because of lazy planning and implementation.  I get that it’s beta but I’m not going to risk 300 caps per death when anyone and their mother can gank me because the mode is flawed and glitched.   It can all be fixed BTW and the author of this thread made a very reasonable and compelling argument how. 
---
Yeah, but if your on pc maybe not
---
Stalk me around the map, dealing slap damage, tossing grenades/mollys, hitting my base, blocking me from looting...so on and so forth.
---
Definitely agree.
---
They’ve managed to get some bits right in the game but they don’t seem to have the basic infrastructure in place.
---
Are you letting the health regen? You can't burn a 3\* quickly.
---
I would wear nothing else if this existed. 
---
Disconnected from server.
---
it's mainly people who don't pvp who think their full set of x01 power armor and dragon are actually going to beat any melee that isn't a Mr Handy saw. 
---
Good, good.
---
Sounds like something such as that should have been fixed *before* launching a PvP mode. 
---
But this is Bethesda, they just throw things out and hope they "just work".
---
I don't think so. Not on PC anyway. On PC you can buy a good weapon for caps like a 1\* bloodied rifle but you can't buy a god tier weapon for caps like a 3\* bloodied explosive rifle. And you don't need that many caps to buy a good weapon, maybe 2-3 days worth of vendor running. So PvP makes no difference really. The God tier weapons will be for trade only and a lot of the traders with such weapons are at max caps now as well.
---
IT JUST WORKS!
---
Instead of sexually identifying as a mistake, I would sexually identify as a death claw. 
---
Thank you for saying entitlement because I was hesitant to. 
---
I had this happen for spawn protection. I set up a trapped fast travel mat at my workshop and the person who spawned in proceeded to walk through walls, all as I was shooting him, followed by my death. He only took damage after I took damage. Seems like duel mechanics we're involved. Maybe due to the workshop defense event? Though I don't think that gives you event protection...
---
That is a super bizarre complaint. Pretty stupid actually 
---
My assumption is that the Atom Store is a pseudo-subscription service to supplement its continued development (on the corporate side). They're aiming to try and get you to pay occasionally, even begrudgingly, every once and a while as a sort of mimic to the 10-15 dollar/month subscription services.
---
It's an MMO model with "buy it once and you get it forever!" at the front door with bait if you play long enough to get more than your 60 dollars worth. Betting on peoples erratic spending instead of betting on them to commit to a monthly payment is likely a bit more lucrative these days.
---
Mad lad.
---
I think the slaps been fixed which was my biggest issue now that you mention it. Dude kept killing me at the Halloween event. 
---
The base shit sucks tho I bet. I would hate to loose my generator. 
---
I want u to prove me wrong.
---
I switched to an Alt at level 76 my alt is now 88  and has a good build my first character is a mess.
---
It was the best thing I did,  the 2nd build was loads more fun and much easier 
---
No trying to fix my original character .. it’s going to take a lot of time! 
---
The Marine wetsuit and marine tactical helmet.
---
As of last patch it’s been really bad again
---
oh shit I'd only seen 1 of these. guhhhhh neeeeed
---
Both my sniper and melee characters use just 1 weapon and any explosives they come across.  My PA character has 2 different heavy weapons.  My non PA Heavy wepon character has 2 weapons and a stockpile of explosives.
---
My last charcter that I started just yesterday, is a stealth melee character and will be using a couple Daggers and a pistol(purely for Gun Runner + quick switch to get around a bit quicker while not sneaking).
---
I don't really run into any situations that warrent using a different weapon, at least none worth the effort.  Now if Scorchbeast were Guaranteed Legendaries I...actually I'd still farm other legendary mobs, because Scorbeast are too annoying to deal with.  Onlyenemy I can think that might be an issue ever, are wall mounted turrets, but that's what explosives are for.
---
"the build", weapons, armor, tactics, play style... all of that mixed together. Know they self.
---
Funny you bring that up I got a two shot Fatman the other day at WS.  Would have preferred the bloodied dragon but compared to SBQ run it’s more worth it 
---
That’s what survival mode is I reck’n. I’m too afraid to go myself. 
---
I'm on PC and I think the performance is better than release but I still get frame drops and stutters so it can definitely still be improved
---
Yeah slaps are fixed now but I bet I'll still get trolled. Its not even like I'm doing anything. I'm minding my own business. I'll wave to people when I see them, sometimes I even drop booze and food for them if I have extra on me.
---
This is a lot better than simply not letting people join PvP and as much as I would love a fair playing ground of ALPS(Average Level Per Server) this would also make things more enjoyable and possibly not let me die in less than three hits, though kitted players could probably spawn kill me still.
---
I really just want servers to retain a 10 level difference tbh, that way level 200 people can't kill a new survival character that's like 27 or something in one blow.
---
I play on the XBone, and I've seen it at Watoga Station.  Not sure on the price though.  
---
PS4, but thanks. 
---
😂 have fun and if you didn't know already, don't forget to look for new wall plans, I believe they can all be centrally found at the whitesprings train station, for a bundle of caps, and be careful of high level ghouls but inside whitespring on the bottom floor is a ton of different stores to shop from, Studio 58 sells C.A.M.P. plans of all kinds.
---
Huh? it's already a problem bro.  What you want me to record myself dying? lol.  If you log in, you can't move right away, turrets load in and start shooting you.  I'm not reporting a speculative issue, I'm reporting an issue and just pointing out that they also announced they are increasing turret damage.   You just said yourself that the invulnerability is not working great.  So what are you getting at?  lol
---
Thanks!!
---
Couple thousand 5mm
---
Just gotta believe in the heart of the cards and the trolling will stop. 
---
You see Astor, my wasteland has no pathetic trolls. 
---
Yes. Part of my issue could be that iu'm also partially colorblind. 
---
Fallout 4 had a lot of great assets to build with.  Most of them were scrappy structures which was awesome.  I personally am not a fan of the perfectly neat building assets in Fallout 76.  I wish they would port over the assets from Fallout 4.  Certain YouTubers like Norespawns and NAHTE1696 make amazing settlements and I wish I could do that in Fallout 76.
---
Junk Walls, especially the taller ones, would be awesome to secure small town-like CAMPS.  A Junk Wall bundle was added to the Creation Club a while back which would be great to build with in Fallout 76.  It was very modular and the walls snapped together.
---
I play on the PS4 and my favorite thing to do in Fallout 4 was build settlements.  My favorite mods were those that allowed you to build almost every asset in the game in your settlements.  Some examples being destroyed Airplane pieces, destroyed boat pieces, ruined trailers, and even those giant scrappy windmills.  It would be great if Fallout 76 allowed us to build assets like that and more so our CAMPS feel more unique.  And it would be nice if building was less strict and certain things would sink into the ground better, like in Fallout 4. 
---
I just really want to make a sort of shanty town in Fallout 76 with more character than just cleanly constructed buildings.  Using ruined plane pieces, trailers, and scrappy makeshift buildings would give it more character.  Adding complimentary details like giant windmills and junk walls would be nice too.
---
I just dont see why anyone has to spend real money...it simple enough to gain atoms from all the various challenges. I still have &gt; 4K left and I've got several paints and such like Blackbird,  woodland camo, excavator and so on. I also check it daily to grab any freebies and for any sales. Smart buying is the ticket!
---
I’m sorry that happened to you. It’s crazy to me to think you got your credentials other than fighting scorchbeasts and made it to the hundreds before attempting one. You seem like a positive person and a delight to encounter in the wasteland. I hope the next one works out for you. Don’t give up! 
---
Does not bother me at all.  I really don't care if people like games I like.  
---
Interesting, thank you! I've got pretty high charisma, so I've been looking for a good spot to blow all these caps. 
---
Damn I got a white and black tux and everything too bad I'm on PS4, any interior pics?
---
perhaps oil, acid, wood (for fuel) and just because its the fallout universe. Nuclear material
---
I've had this happen a few times but I figured it was a melee glitch.
---
Also noticed it happen a couple times when I try to kill the behemoth spawn at the pond. 
---
Even then, there are Weapon Workbenches all over the place, and if you are really desperate you could just start using whatever weapons your enemies drop.  Honestly did that for one of my characters, until i got to about 22 or so and had stockpiled enough .308 to just use that until I got my heavy weapons.
---
r/falloutraiders welcomes ye 
---
How about a take something leave something rule so there is always something in the box.
---
Four. Combat Knife, Handmade, Large Deathclaw and ski sword. I favor the knife and I'm  lvl 105. Fits my needs perfectly.  
---
Can you [fill out a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) for me so we can look into this?
---
You’re absolutely right. I never thought of that. I would be your unintentional demise. 
---
Yeah c'mon why is it so hard to make the SBQ drop 3 star stuff? Or any 3 star for that matter, they ONLY drop one star items IF THAT. Many don't drop any legendary. At all.
---
Very interesting i hope they fix the damage the pip boy shows if thats the case.
---
Can you [submit a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) here over this?
---
If you have patience you can go around and make robots spawn in Watoga and get a chance.
---
I actually just passed by Spruce Knob to get a Nuclear Keycard and they DC'd and I felt bad :c
---
But yeah I refuse to contest workshops for the most part.
---
Thanks! I'll definitely subscribe to that.
---
Heh. I posted about corpses in FO4. Finding corpses is a nightmare when you're colorblind. You never know if thekre right in front of you or if the ragdoll physics have tossed the body over to the next town. 
---
What was that!?! I can't hear you over the drama!
---
I like how I have 4 downovotes and nobody has answered my legitimate question.   If I'm not hearing it, maybe I have the solution to whatever your problem is.  Whatever, not my problem.  Hope they never fix it :)

Two. TSE double barrel and 3* Assassin's cultist dagger.
---
I have friends who carry tons of weapons but I don't get it, my shotgun gets the job done.
---
Level 152 melee build.
---
Combat knife for tagging high level and killing low level enemies
---
Boxing glove because I like to flatten faces
---
Powerfist for PvP
---
Axe and Explosive Gatling for Queen
---
Explosive shotgun for silos 
---
Explosive MG42 for Workshop PvP
---
Daisycutter stays in my stash mostly but my friends like to troll and play nuclear football 
---
i personally think it is kind of dumb how you cannot use them at other's camp. just link them to your own stash box
---
Overall yes, but there is still plenty of room for improvement.
---
The servers are a lot more stable than they were, and a lot of improvements have been made to address weird graphical glitches or enemy behaviors.  But the servers still struggle when there are a lot of items to track, the games frame rate will plummet if there are too many particle effects (like in Whitesprings if there are a lot of vehicles burning)
---
PC performance is bad as usual. Dont know how it performs on consoles.
---
Hmmm, this could be a stability issue. I did this with a streamer the other night. She was hosting a 12 hours event and was doing giveaways and events. She gave out the vintage nukashine out for free. We all took it at the same time, and right when almost everybody was in the same place, the server crashed as well. Could be coincidence, could be a bug. 
---
You gain access to unlock perks at level 50, but you only get one perk point to spend at level 50.  So, for example, if you want master heavy gunner at rank 3, you'll need to be at least level 52.  If you want more than one perk that's unlocked at level 50, you'll need a few more levels after that.
---
Additionally, gear matters.  If you didn't  exploit for xp, level is a rough approximation of time spent leveling a character.  If you didn't trade for gear with another character, a higher level player is more likely to have the best gear.  
---
Ideally matchmaking would account for both a "gear score" and for level, though the top level limiting group would be something like 60+.  The gear scoring would need to include items that aren't equipped or even that are in inventory to avoid someone unequipping all their gear before joining, then equipping once in game.  
---
I do buy on sale and don't own even half of the atom store. (one armor paint only I think...) buy I have bought build assets especially on limited time only available. I don't know how people are gaining atoms so fast. I was doing dailies regularly and only getting max 100 atoms a day....
---
I'm not sure how, but it happens. They won't scratch a good build, but most people seem to fall victim to the shame and donate caps to the cause. 
---
Yes, but if they were, you could hold them an inch away from your face to read them. This is a request to simulate that. 
---

Wait. Are you saying that Scorchbeast Queens are supposed to drop loot? I thought they just did the spinning circle thing. 
---
Holster your weapon then go into third person mode and then go into build mode. If you tap the touch button it switches your point of view, if you hold the button it switches to build mode. 
---
Please mention how many people have replied to this. 
---
Level also dosent affect drop rates it is based off a combinations of specials and number of player in a given scenario not level

But people are telling me there IS an option that may help. 
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Gear matter also only if you have a build to support otherwise everyone with sentinal area in armor would be unstobbale
---
I fought the queen at level 25 you'll do fine.
---
Oof, he charged 150 caps per Nukashine? Boy made BANK
---
I usually do a Whitesprings run and find him in the parking lot next to the robots area and fireman robot. He's a damn profitable spawn if you sell the chems. 
---
Serendipity ftw, smack smack dead. Dragon rifle builds are one of my favorite flavors. They just don't understand why you don't die and they keep seeking revenge. The tse builds are my absolute favorite to kill, though. Fireproof and dense armor means your tse handmade simply cleans the dried blood off my armor, leaving behind a flawless shine and a hint of lemon freshness. 
---
I agree with this
---
doesn't even have to be that, just go to the edges around the map where the border pushes you back and find a small slope and keep getting pushed back till you fall through the slope, or find a door that has a gap and do the power armor thing to get into a wall, or just fall through the game randomly while loading, or put a camp in a location where the load zone is in a rock, there is just so many dozens of ways to work your way into the geometry anything that rewarded living too much would always end with winners under the map and inside cliffs and walls instead of big fun firefights. 
---
It's pretty sweet looking. There are YouTube videos that tell where to find the plans. I'm still trying to find the plans for the level 3&amp;4 mods for it. The helmet took me about two days of server hopping before I found them 
---
They are trying a simplified PVP mode where damage and defense mostly does not matter. It makes the tanky defensive perks pretty worthless. 
---
Good builds, bad builds, fuck em, they are all the same. What seems to matter is invisibility and sentinel/cavalier invincibility. Though I have been able to kill those invincible set users with critical hits. Somehow I can now build critical meter with zero damage dealt, so that is a huge bonus.
---
Where's all of the 'got lamp' jokes??
---
We have had this in since biv was implemented. 
---
the forest and ash heap = easy XP.  
---
Couple days ago on my way back to my Forest camp, I happened by Gregs mining - there were a few low level scorched ... adn I saw them take down a  13.  
---
Got to her in time to save w/ a stimpack, pointed out the key upstars, and on my merry way I went.
---
Somehow, I dont think the 13 would have been amused if I beought some L30 scorched with me. 
---
Why make it (more) difficult for new(er) players?
---
Morgantown airport L6 horde was hard enough solo as a L10 - 
---
Last thing I would want is a bunch of L20 mutants because a higher level player walked by (or tried to help me)
---
Question. If you are fighting the Scorchbeast Queen and disconnect when you get back are you boosting her up again?
---
Quit your whining, the atom store is optional cosmetics. 
---
Well I believe there is prestige characters coming soon. I can’t wait for it because I royally fucked up my perk cards.
---
Nice, good to know. I never noticed 
---
So better hip fire accuracy effects vats? What does range effect? Damage fall off?
---
you dying in one hit to a deathclaw gauntlet?
---
Okay, sounds good.  Add me as a friend and I'll see you tonight.
---
This seems to be the case all over the map.
---
I usually grab stuff from containers around vendors when I do my daily selling circuit. It's been days since Ive seen anything in them. 
---
I guess we should wait for Nuclear Winter.
---
Which absolutely baffles me! There was SEVEN YEARS between Fo3 and Fo4. I woulda been absolutely stunned to see FO5 released like three years after 4 was released. Idk why people would have expected that at all...
---
Well that's just a hurtful comment. But, that's your opinion man.
---
Power armor is a serious detriment when you're fighting a good melee build. Even your turn speed is lower, making it easy to simply walk behind ya. Leave the PA at home, kids. Use defensive perks. 
---
I literally have a pair about a foot away from my TV on a shelf getting all dusty and it just dawned on me that I could use them for this. You made my day.
---
That's true, but a level 40 can't equip a lvl 50 3 star legendary.  The level 200 that ran the same even dozens of times has more "rolls" to get that good loot.  
---
I’ll check them out. Thanks.
---
That update is going to be so fucking cool. I can’t wait for more player to player interactions.
---
Something like that would make me go back to a sniper rifle from my lever action rifle.  I would figure what I can't one-shot with my maxed sneak and rifleman perks, my concentrated fire and the extra damage would make quick work out of it.
---
I had a character at 60 but restarted once I knew what I was doing with selecting perks.
---
Early on I took too many quality of life perks (weight, foot duration, etc) and not enough focus on things that you can't offset with in game items. Damage, defense 9non-power armor), etc
---
Choosing a weapon is key and maxing it. If you are non-melee/non-shotgun  I think sneak is almost required. Full auto/Commando is a resource hog.
---
Do a build on [FalloutBuilds.com](https://FalloutBuilds.com) or [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com) … at 100 I would not start over. Levels are fast and with any luck you will not have to move too many points to get them where you want.
---
Aid section.  Same as chems 
---
The problem I'm having is trying to hook up a switch on the inside.

The disconnect today spawned me in the same place but no nuke, no SBQ and a lot lighter thanks to wasting a load of ammo :(

I never really liked multi-player before I tried this game.

People keeps asking for private servers, I used to want that too, but now I can’t imagine enjoying this world on my own.

Getting together in a big group to take down the sqb is so much fun. 
---
It’s a pure fantasy game, the exact opposite of survival, you stand still in magic armor and hop like a bunny to rule this game. The cops in da hoodz would love it when criminals do this in the real world.

Or...you could get something called glasses

You know that it is still in beta right?

I would like to put on inside. The outside was easy. 
---
And after that they took down the lot from the store... What a shame, 'twas a great outfit, not mentioning it already got some nice mods.
---
Same here, I've got 1400+ hours in FO4, mainly building. Most of my settlements were super detailed, which I understand we wont get with 76, but a bit more variety in building materials would be really nice. 
---
Had a feeling that the story would end this way, based on the title. 
---
I see it like Vegas. You pay for the Experience
---
I want to come back to the game eventually. I really think there is fun to be had. Honestly, I hated the weight capacity and storage having a weight more than most of the bugs. Every 5 seconds that I looted, I had to come back to drop something off, which I didn't like at all.
---
I got this game when it came out, and RDR2 was there as well. Combine the aforementioned issues with the lack of polish, general bad decision making, consistent choices that were made to sell microtransactions and other glaring issues, FO76 lost me. I'm not ignorant that it's getting better, and I would love to give it another shot when I have time. 
---
Wait, did I miss something? Are vaults going to be like raids or some shit or what?

Alot of the trolls and griefers moved to survival mode

---
If they are right I'm not sure they can fix the pip boy as it's percentage of enemies health rather than any of the damage numbers we are currently using.
---
I'm not sure what to believe but I do know from personal experience PvPing that the damage doesn't feel right.
---
I'm kind of ok giving them my money for nicer looking cosmetics, that I could earn by grinding if I wanted, considering we're getting free DLC and they're actually updating the game (Unlike another bullshit micro-transaction fueled online game that shall remain nameless.)
---
lemme guess: 2\* wood left leg?
---
Yeah, that's pretty much what I'm doing. Currently residing in the quonset hut next to the crazy cat house. Using existing structures is great, but I'd still love to make a lean-to out of pallets and a tarp. lol 
---
Actually in my experience build is just a small part of it. I'm level 269 and got absolutely slaughtered in survival last night bc other players were smarter, stealthier, and had the patience to sneak around. My build couldn't be any better for Adventure anyway, I have an OP shotgun and excellent armor. I still got my ass kicked. And if I'm honest, I had an absolute blast! I haven't had a real challenge in this game in a long time. 
---
Survival takes actual strategy if people are playing right. Yeah there are losers who spawn camp but fuck them, the people who are playing it as intended and hunting people down add so much to the experience.
---
How much did the base game changed from Beta to release?
---
I'm providing feedback. That's what a Beta is for. For other companies, at least.
---
THX: The Audience Is Now Deaf
---
Agreed, the recent dark woodland power armor paint priced at 1000 atoms seems fair in Atoms.
---
In real dollars I think $5 would be acceptable, so Atoms at $1 to 200 Atoms would be more like it for a base price. Then sell Atom bundles to encourage players to buy more at like $25 for 6500 Atoms, $50 for 15000 Atoms.
---
Then I might actually buy some, I was a Whale for Planetside 2, make me some offers I can't refuse and I'll buy.
---
Survival mode isn't really a harder survival experience like Hardcore and Survival mode were from previous games. It's a PVP oriented mode. Maybe Nuclear Winter where we'll get a PVE oriented mode, but with much more strict and demanding survival needs than adventure mode.
---
I have a very hard time believing this simply because my experience has been so opposite. 
---
I appreciate it, I've got tents, and they tents have to be flat or they "float" in the air. Thanks for the offer, though. :)

3 different Grognaxes, some are Weightless, all are for dealing with the queen
---
Thing is, damage does matter. Defense is the only thing that doesn't. But then again, this is Bethesda. A mess like this was to be expected from them.
---
Outstanding and agreed on all accounts. Perhaps Bethesda is heading this direction based on the trailer for the upcoming DLC. More underground locations. 
---
Taking a retrospective look at FO4, 3 of their DLC involved basically new worlds (well, Vault 88 wasn’t a new world but the build space was gigantic). I was very partial to Nuka World but I know that most favored Far Harbor. 
---
Just the exploration of an abandoned/occupied theme park was awesome. And the enemies there were almost the hardest in the game (Far Harbor harder, I realize) and it kept me going back there consistently. Not because of the NPC’s (though I loved Mags and Mason), but because of the challenging world. 
---
Now, if only we could get the turrets to consistently shoot at things... srsly.  Half the ti.e they don't even attack mobs hitting them, let alone something attacking me or my base.
---
If they added a high damage semi auto pistol like the Eagle I would be very happy, and I think we would see more high end pistol users.
---
Base the rewards on damage done to the queen
---
Touche my friend:D
---
This is why forced character restart is such a stupid argument. If I was forced to make a new character for survival I’d get creamed. I have one level 65 but I have no clue what legendaries are good what perk cards are good, how to farm junk/aid to not die. 
---
***Yes, keep it.*** Exploding bullets are on the way out (or at least will not be OP) … Weapons that work on hard percentages are *great* for the long haul
---
I've watched all of Jug's videos, but what I'm saying is I want uneven walls and roof pieces. All of the walls and roofs  are very square, too. 
---
ATM faction vendors have separate 200 cap limits that reset once every 24hrs but a patch coming soon will merge all cap limits together to form a pool of 1400caps to buy and sell from
---
Fyi;
---
Iirc the faction vendors are Responders, Raiders, Watoga, Free States, Brotherhood of Steel, Enclave, Whitesprings.
---
Responders are easiest found in Flatwoods.
---
Raiders are next to the Top of The world (the giant red top thing on the map) at the train station and a unique vendor in the ski lodge.
---
Free states is at Harper's ferry east of the top of the world.
---
Brotherhood of Steel is inside of Watoga at the super duper mart.
---
Enclave is locked until you do the enclave quest line but it's inside around whitesprings 
---
Whitesprings and Watoga are at the train stations of the respectively named places, with Whitesprings resort having a bunch of vendors selling different stuff on the ground floor, and on the second floor, a restaurant you sit to be served at, A bar vendor, and a Nuka Cola vendor
---
So I'm curious if any one has factored all the unmarked fissure sites into a plan like this.
---
Agree. Double/triple tap VATS headshots are awesome
---
I'll give it a try tonight after work. 
---
Im still waiting to see a 3 star protest sign.....
---
Could work, but where does one put the cutoff? 
---
Melee users and lower geared people can still contribute by killing the adds off, which would otherwise tear up the heavy ranged.
---
Also to get better buying and selling prices you can equip the Hard Bargain perk card, pop a grape mentats and eat a sweet roll.
---
The level forty gets the same number of chances though even if they can't equip the level 50 3star
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Basically, it's going to be "high difficulty team content."

[From Roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
Good luck dude wrong console for me but safe travels. 
---
There were a lot of posts from people who expected a flawless release. 
---
Oh, I'm with you there. On my main I have a large, fancy structure that would be REALLY nice to have more interior wall options. 
---
Is your user name in game the same as on reddit? did a search and could not find it. My tag is RogueAOV. We are always looking to add a friend and search the wealth :)
---
Who even thought this was a good idea
---
No amount of Caps can get top
---
Tier armor or weapons on pc...... even if I offered 75k caps ...... it wouldn’t even   get me one piece of assassins/ sentinel armor
---
I love this...will definitely have to try it
---
Yeah I feel you, just as close as you can get for now :)
---
EvilDisko
---
Total RNG.
---
I got another freaking legendary drill last night from a 3*.
---
Sold for 20 caps.
---
There is give and take. I find it frustrating to enter west tek and see wall to wall Lvl 10 Mutants, but I know that a server hop later, it’s back to level 68’s. 
---
A new player can see Wavy Willard’s has high level, hop, and it’s back to level 10-20’s. 
---
My favorite thing about SBQ is wasting tons of ammo to get a level 15 nocturnal leather left leg, though! /s 
---
I mean I’m willing to help. Are you doing adventure or survival?
---
Then of course, there's the other conundrum - Adrenal Reaction and Nerd Rage add so much damage to my Bloodied build, so I'd probably want to be low health anyway. 
---
Sadly I think this would be the most viable in survival since I wouldn't have to stay low health, but then I'd have to get addicted after every death. Maybe there should be a perk card for it, to keep addictions through death, but gives you a small bonus or something (most players would see it as a negative thing, but for Junkies weapon users it would be awesome).
---
Everyone already does this with suitcases and cash registers. You just have to actually look. 
---
Exactly, I'm on Pc too with 5 characters (max number) on 1 account, every each of them sitting at max caps.  
---
Nobody want to sell good stuff for caps...  
---
I’m not calling you a liar. This game has so many visual bugs that perhaps it’s possible you could have seen them as a glitch, but they truly don’t exist. 
---
I mean, the workshops for junk can help with getting plastic, but will be unreliable.
---
With a 2.5x sneak attack, 2x head shot, and 1.85x critical hit, my 301 damage black powder pistol was failing to hill people at full health with 1,800 damage. I really do not think damage matters. Other people have reported they can kill from full health from one bullet. I know my damage. It should kill. It doesn't. Everyone, from naked level 6's hiding in a shack to big boy power armor users are all left with the same exact health threshold.
---
also don't forget the fact that many of the people most upset never have played a mmo - I'll use me and a friend for example I'm a huge early access / mmo person so fallout 76 bugs were pretty par for the course and wihle some were annoying I never really found any ground breaking for me - he on the other hand had only played 1 mmo (wow) several years after it started so he lost his mind at every bug every odd texture and refused to play till last week from week 1 and now loves it (I bought him 3 early access games to show him as examples)
---
Are you accusing Mr. Steve Martin of being ungentlemanly.  Well, I never.
---
Yeah, why the heck should I be interested in waiting unspecified amount of time to get the effects I won't really need anyways? Bethesda, pz, give us some more incentives to try out your content other than "IT'S NEW, YOU GOTTA CHECK IT OUT!!!11!!1!" - this doesn't work anymore.
---
Yeah, you can access your stash at other ppl camp stash box 😂
---
I bet they did that until they made sure things couldn't be duped 
---
My serendipity works, but the high levels now me down instantly, making it basically useless.
---
Yes, per attempt.  
---
Adventure. Guess i need some high lvl to clear out enemies at i donno? Golf club still good?
---
The unmarked open ones do not close, at least under normal conditions. The already closed ones do not open when nuked. 
---
Same here only a few times i was able to escape without dying
---
I had disabled pacifist mode which makes this even more confusing.
---
Have a secondary weapon and equip it.. then switch back. I have it hot keyed since it seems to happen somewhat frequently. 
---
It’s ok, but I’m pretty sure it got nerfed. If you want, I can go to my level 77 character and help you.
---
Im on PS4 and I have had this happen to me several times and like you said only at the worst moments but I thought it was just a power fist thing. I have never had it happen on any other weapon.
---
I'd love to go! I just need to find my suit
---
May be psychosomatic... but got a tse pipe bolt rifle the other night and a instigating machete with faster swing. RNGesus has been on my side. 
---
I did get a drill also though. Can’t win em all. 
---
That's weird, now I've completed it the boys never attack me or the vendor, maybe it's bugged? (Either for you or for me) 
---
Worse than thatm when it was announced they came out and said "This won't be Fallout 5, this is something else" and people immediately went "Oh boy! Fallout 5!!!" and then got mad when, surprise, it wasn't Fallout 5
---
I'm not understand what your saying now if they have the same chances then thereis no advantage
---
Sure thing. I recognize it beats the “doesn’t trust others” part of your character, but let me know if there’s anything I can do
---
Batboy is the scorchbeast king we haven't met yet
---
Ive heard it multiple times i think its flatwoods monster i ran into him a couple times following the screams. Very creepy 
---
But these perk choices make an rpg an rpg.
---
No I was number 1 at the time. Killed him twice and because it was so chaotic with a few other players trying to get me too, fast traveled to vault 76. As I was loading into the game, I hear someone shooting at me and saw later that it was that person. Fortunately, I loaded up slightly faster that time and managed to kill him again before he killed me. Got my health real low though. Took some stimpaks and again fast traveled to sutton station. For some reason, it took longer to load into Sutton Station and again same thing, as I was loading into the game, heard the same sounds. But this time when I fully loaded in, I was already dead. This was only one of the times though. There were multiple other times when I saw alot of action going on at a station and fast traveled there only to load into the game already dead.
---
I found a vampires 3 star yesterday so i wanted to play around with it even if its terrible. I also crafted like 3 or them to scrap and got no mods unlocked... hopfully i have better luck today.
---
that fits over power armor.
---
Just so you’re aware the nuke codes are unnecessary. Even after collecting all the codes you still need to decrypt them which is a pain in the ass. Use [this site](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) for the weekly codes 
---
I got that and I'm sincerely happy for you. Three stars have either dropped 1* for me or spawned directly among the Whitespring bots. 
---
I'm pretty sure the luck you're experiencing is not a general rule.
---
My friend and I cornered a guy and slowly beat him to death with it while he was out of ammo. To make it worse for him, I was like level 15 (friend and guy dying were both around 60)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFhjsITKo-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFhjsITKo-0) 
---
issue solved
---
If it’s a 4 pack I’d say 1800 is a safe guess.  
---
I get to play fallout same time as my friend. Is it perfect. No. But it's getting better and lets me play fall out with my buds. 
---
Thanks for the compliment. I'm having a blast. First multiplayer game I've played since the early counterstrike/q3a days. First online rts for sure. I like exploring and doing things organically. Not big on just mindless XP grinding. If I'm at Whitespring, I'll clear out the golf club and then move on to other things. If I happen upon a nuke zone, I'll run around for an hour and get some kills and flux and then move on.
---
Oh I've killed plenty of scorch beasts. Anytime I see one I go after it to spare others who might not be prepared for dealing with one. Enforcer perk for the win. But it was my first queen. I probably should've sat it out as I've been following the main quest religiously. My next step is to drop a nuke, then it's queen time.

---
I highlighted a few people on Xbox who are selling their building services.
---
The bots stay Red to me but never attack. As soon as I approach the vendor, they spawn, as the vendor is a different faction, they actively hunt him. As soon as he knows they are near, he will walk out and fight them and won’t allow trades until they are dead. I end up speeding this process up. If I manage to get the vendor before he walks away, I can trade, but the bots still attack him while he’s trading with me. So once again I exit the menu, kill, and trade again. 
---
Do you like downvotes?
---
They are both extremely versatile, but handmade can get up to 20+ pounds with mods. Not sure about the combat. I'd go combat if you don't like carrying a small child.
---
Without mods, yes. With all the mods you can run... NV and FO4 never crash for me and run very stable. That said, modding them improperly causes the opposite to happen. I think this is a bit of a rude awakening for BGS that hey, modders aren't there to fix your game this time.
---
And there were a lot of posts from people who didn't expect a flawless release.
---
Majority of the gaming community also hasn’t played it. If you don’t try something you won’t know if you like it. They listened to articles online and took them for granted. 
---
The same reason people shitpost in forums dedicated to a game they don't like, they enjoy it for some reason. 
---
Know any good areas? Was kinda hoping for a place with tons of enemies. If ur 72 i guess lvl 62 ones will spawn. We could go around the course? I dont know whats best
---
You on PC? I was over on the ground all by myself to the west of the warehouse. Wearing my schoolbus power armor. Most of the adds were ignoring me and she kept flying right over my head so I got in a lot of good belly shots. Did you get anything good when she went down?
---
I don't know man, everything is completely messed up in this mode.
---
3
---
I did not own a workshop at the time in fact I had just spawned into the game. It is possible that I did hit them accidentally while everything was still loading in but I wouldn't have any footage of that. I only started recording after he requested my hunting rifle because I had been in the same situation before and I wanted to get it on camera this time.
---
containers for sure have longer stay-ability then paper bags.  
---
The majority of the gaming community has herd mentality that’s why they don’t like fallout 76. Don’t be a sheep, make up your own mind on the game. 
---
I got a server disconnect as well. I was assuming it may have been a server wide issues. 
---
I guess I expected to see a buggy beta and then they would fix some of the more egregious issues. Apparently I shouldn't expect that though, as last time I posted this I got yelled at for even considering a beta to be a beta where we test things and then the company fixes them. But that's what it needed. Beta, wipe progress, give them a few months and then release. I wouldn't have liked it, but it would have been far better in the long run.
---
This made my afternoon. Keep up the good work. 
---
I stick with it as it’s slowly improving and I hope that it turns into the game that we :
---
Were promised
---
We want
---
We paid for
---
We deserve
---
And that it just works
---
I love Bethesda and their games, but not FO76.   This game should’ve never been launched.   
---
I really tried to have fun with it with my friends, but I remember saying to them while playing it “This just isn’t a fun game.”    Uninstalled and never looked back.
---
I’m more concerned that they will use the same old engine and formula in ES6.   They need a new engine if they want to remain a AAA publisher going forward in my opinion.
---
If they increase invulnerability this problem disappears, and they are going to do that.
---
The outfit goes well with medical google and gas mask.  
---
That’s it! Thanks man!
---
As an Accidental Melee Character, I approve.
---
**STOP THE BOTS!**
---
People made all kinds of promises to themselves about the game and when bethesda didn't deliver on those peoples personal promises it was apparently bethesdas fault.
---
The fervor from NV folk before 76 release was INSANE. I had to unsubscribe from the main fallout subreddit from all of the circle jerking and hate posts on my reddit front page.
---
I would love to pal, not exactly a professional by any means though 
---
Psn is TwerkyMyDirky 
---
How the heck did you get the price that low? With 11 CHA, grape mentats, and a beer it still cost me close to 1.5k
---
They are random daily quests from Biv. Also there is a random lemonade stand that pops up and sells 2 recipes for lemonade and hard lemonade. The fermenter is used after you craft alcohol. Put fermentable alcohol in there to speed up the process  
---
If you want to go around the white springs, then I don’t mind. It’s pretty good even if it’s not nuked.
---
I am not sure if that was a purposeful or accidental reference
---
Personally I hope outerworlds bombs just to see those people somehow try to spin obsidian not being at fault and still being god's gift to this green earth.
---
I preordered it for 80$ still didnt like it
---
but would you pay 60$ for it?
---
&gt; I feel that there is more story in FO76 then the others to be honest. Plus the voice acting in the holotapes are pretty dam good. 
---
Couldn't agree .more...people need to slow down and read/listen to the story. FO76 advanced the lore more than any title since the original...maybe excepting 3s lore. The problem comes from folks wanting to power level and fast traveling everywhere. There are at least as many unmarked locations as marked. 
---
Uhh, sure that'd be fine on a ghoul or even super mutant. But on the SBQ, a mirelurk queen, or behemoth? Yeah nah, that's a bit much.
---
Do you have hard bargain rank 3?
---
Im trying to find a reason to like this game
---
Is that you, ZombieUnicorn?
---
The drill is clearly a bug, and I'm not talking about specific rolls on items, I'm talking about 2-3* enemies being more likely to drop 2-3* items.
---
I paid 80$ and have tried it, still havent found a reason to enjoy it, im trying to find out how
---
Also the sound they added when your wanted. Literally anything you do triggers the gunfire sound effect. Sitting down, sleeping, checking your pip boy, checking your map. It sound only play once and that’s it.
---
I feel you.
---
Yeah if u dont know a better place? Gt: Slubby
---
I completely agree
---
"Tobacco Road" would be a good one.
---
In my experience the handmades are best full auto, where as the combat rifle is superior semiauto. What's better? Depends on your preferences and scenario.
---
Very similar however the .45 ammo for a combat rifle is much more plentiful in game. Combat rifles are easier to find in game to break down for mods.
---
Again I watched it pop out of reality not fly away... it if anything fell out of the map.
---
And in the end it is all lipstick anyway. People all-to-often pay unreasonable amounts due to vanity.
---
"Atom system is well balanced" 
---
what are you smoking? only 20 points for exploring Appalachia for 7600 hours...
---
Speaking of the Mr Handy saw, I have an Anti-Armor one sitting in my stash. With the "repair" damage boosts for the auto-melee weapons, does it go anywhere with Anti-Armor? Perhaps usable in survival with the higher damage from all weapons?  
---
Not everyone likes the same games, I don’t know what to say. Some people may love a game, while others may hate it. Most people have never played it and just wanna hop on the hate train. 
---
Well ironclad level 5 doesn't hurt
---
I see these kinds of posts' so damned often, I wish there was a stickied mega thread for it.
---
^I ^need ^clean ^walls ^and ^proper ^half ^slabs ^vertical ^and ^horizontal.
---
Also there is no level restriction for legendary prefixes so you can have a explosive shotgun spawn at level 5
---
Really?  New Vegas, a game that can only use 4gb of ram and will immediately CTD if it hits the limit, never crashes for you?
---
I have 20/20 and struggle to read lots of the notes lmao. This is something that has bugged me since Skyrim with the books, they have the entire display to work with, but books were shrunk down significantly leaving like a quarter of display unused, then the text in the books is also shrunk way down leavin huge borders around the pages... If this was a stylistic decision (not sure why it would be) they should really have captions or standard text options like in Red Dead 2. 
---
I’m a stealth rifle build. Never even get hit really. 
---
Lol
---
Yes, that too.
---
If you haven't found a home for it, I'll take it. IGN: jchamlin
---
I enjoy fallout , and this is fallout.
---
why do you like it?
---
I’d like to see a weapon effect that relies on you being healthy. But stay healthy. Like no rads, no diseases, no special reduction.  
---
Just keep your eyes open for it. It's of course not guaranteed, but I think they did increase the chance of getting a 2-3* item from a 2-3* legendary (excluding drills which are clearly a bug)
---
'the majority of the gaming community' how can we really ever know such things about anything? This is just a subjective opinion although you tempered it with the word 'seems'.
---
Username doesn’t check out
---
If they fixed it, the posts would go away...  ;-)
---
I was actually amazed how with my disability (only have use of one hand) how accessible the game has been with use of my Razer Naga, I haven't tried to play anything like an FPS until FO76 since my stroke in 2016 but boy am I happy I am able to play it
---
IDK why everyone is bashing the engine it's a fun fucking engine 
---
Well that's frustrating. Fallout 76 being a simulation confirmed. Simulation is being run by the scorched. Can't have us killing their queen.
---
Buying Gilded Minigun, anyone got one for sale? 
---
I roll in BOS Heavy Combat with life saving and chameleon.
---
I don't think people understand that the complexity of modern games makes it extremely hard to launch in a "perfect" state. Iterative titles? A lot easier. But if you look at MMO and large RPG releases over the years they all have issues on release just from their sheer size.
---
Junkies rolling pin for me!
---
This is a total long shot on an old thread, but do you remember where you found the alarm clock? I found one a month or so ago and scrapped it and can't remember where now. I want to say it was in the mire?
---
Oh how I would love that even more😂
---
Level 3 Walking Pharmacy (Strength, reduces chem and stimpack weight).  Go to the river in Flatwoods and collect all of the Bloodleaf you see. It only grows along water sources.  Green Thumb will be helpful for double yield.  Also collect Soot Flowers.  Also collect and boil some water to make Healing Salve.  Chemist is helpful, resulting in quadruple yield.  I just carry 100-200 healing salve on me all the time.
---
I’m agreeing with you. Just don’t have enough data to say if it’s in my head and just noticed descent loot or not. 
---
Anything that says hip fire works in vats
---
idk man it's 1.2k for me with hard bargain and 9 charisma only.
---
And there's another perk I use to make stims and healing salve more effective, I forgot the name.
---
Also please make tritanopia, deuteuranopia, protanopia settings for color blind ppl.
---
Do you have at least 1/3 concentrated fire? If you’re doing any sort of vats build it’s a must have for shots on weak spots (typically head). That alone doubles your damage output. 
---
No, leave sone mystery in the world 
---
Its probably the big thwack when you select a mode thats almost like a weird typewriter key. Its so violent. 
---
But no need to be so bitter about something especially if you arent having the issue... i was just making a joke anyways
---
The Tomahawk plans are stupidly rare. If anyone does sell them for caps that knows what they have when they get it, you're looking at probably 15-25k caps for it.
---
There’s something about the PvE and scavenging aspect I love. The locations and creatures draw me to the game along with all the weapons and other content. Something about the gameplay is just so appealing to me that even the game’s bugs can’t keep me away.
---
The Handmade without question
---
because of player base drop after 24 hours
---
He also drops berry mentats. Yummy!
---
he is a vet that started over with me - so he laughed at me when it happened lol
---
Probably first aid
---
does it really feel like fallout?
---
They do. What you may or may not realize is that enemy levels are based on a couple factors- area of the zone/subzone (you aren’t finding level 60 enemies in the forest, for example) and level of the first player in since that area cell last reset. 
---
I find the game u fun because I cant dight anythi g because only my AK does damage 
---
I'll be honest with ya, I'd be a little irate over getting pwned with a sign. But I can recognize a better player when I see one.
---
yup.  Had the same thing happen when I was 15-25 or so.  Friend of mine that was a 60+ at the time, showing me around.  Path of the wiind was all L48 mutants, all I could do was hide.
---
A bunch of levels later, I went back solo, all L6 scorched.  
---
Ditto the lobby of the excavator quest building and Lewiston.  
---
Didnt know about server hopping at the time, so I stayed in the forest and avoided those places for a long time.
---
OTOH, becuase I stayed on the west side of the map so long, I've now got a much stronger character with which to explore the divde, bog, and mire.
---
I can respect that
---
Move on
---
I agree, it would be great if there was a way to manufacture plastic. It's annoying that it's in the same category as other strictly junk materials.
---
Collecting plastic did get a bit easier though. With the Scrapper perk being tweaked, you now get INSANE amounts of scrap from weapons. Do a clear through of somewhere like West Tek and pick up every gun. Scrap them all and you'll have plenty.
---
I still hit the highschools when I'm not feeling combative. It is a good and quick method if you're trying your damndest for it though.
---
I don't think you lose caps for a survival bounty. People are contributing money towards your bounty. I think when your bounty is claimed it says on their player card that 0 caps were lost for death.
---
Also, concrete bases have been grandfathered in. Some people could just wait the timer out or log out if you try to nuke them. I know one Egyptian pot smoking God (hint hint, witch-hunting rule averted) on PC who has a concrete bunker in the mountains who also enjoys survival mode.
---
Nope
---
That only works on the trading platform ;) Normally I’d say yes, but I’m pretty busy this weekend. Good luck!
---
That is because the Watoga bots aggro everyone and everything. They won't move any of those in to Whitesprings.
---
Can we please select a default mode too... I'm very unlikely to play survival mode and don't need to be given the chance to select it everytime I log in. Let me choose it in settings if I want.
---
If you are using a radium rifle against super mutants that's your problem. A normal hunting rifle would hit way harder.
---
Check out the YouTube channel of Oxhorn. 
---
Great Fallout loremaster.  He recently did a series on Huntersville and West Tek, and the mysterious origins of super mutants in Appalachia. 
---
I played a psycho melee clown with serrated machete for a bit. Was fun. Server was mostly empty, but some higher levels did what I can only describe as a a double take.  I wasn't only for the Fasctnechtchawafqwefhenhimer Festival so I missed the fancy giant masks (the jester mask would be ideal).
---
Basic play style: Bladed melee weapon, maniacal laughter, and basically a total disregard for your own safety (you want the perk that automatically stimpaks you, it really helps when you're fighting a horde). Wear a Vault-Tec Party Hat if you don't have a mask. 
---
Right now I'm playing a long range sniper type build (inasmuch as you can play that at level 19). Cowboy hat, Civil War Suit, Monocle, Single Action Army  Revolver, and I'm just waiting to get a Lever Action Rifle to replace my .308 Hunting Rifle.
---
Basic play style: Anti social. Bounty Hunter. Check for bounties on the map. Hunt bounties from a distance. Use rifle for long range kills, pistol for close up work, and have a Bowie Knife as a backup for if you run out of ammo/are fighting low end enemies (seriously, don't waste ammo on a level 1 ANYTHING). When talking to people, be courteous, but also brief. Speak with a bit of a drawl, maybe some gruffness thrown in. You're a cowboy too late, play it up. HAM it up. Also, ANY TIME AT ALL you come across (instrument of choice--and you'd better have an instrument of choice) you play it. 
---
Yeah but whitespring scales to every lower level (you can find ghouls from level 9 all the way to 62 there) except when you get high enough they don’t get rid of gangrenous ghouls
---
You still got it? I'll buy it off you
---
Range is Damage fall off, yes. And Vats is hipfire 
---
I've had more than a few corpses despawn, or relocate if what I've read is correct. I don't see it a lot, and yes explosions do tend to be able to throw them a long ways.  But they can on occasion appear to simply poof out of existence.
---
Its annoying you can't build across the tracks. I covered it with a nice walkway
---
You get a group. Launch a nuke. Beat her. Then launch another. Beat her. Then launch the last on that server. Beat her. Then server hop. 
---
oh you can do that? (just started playing) then whats the point on such a small limit lol
---
Sadly, I was one of those people. Though a week after launch I changed my ways and like a vault dweller on reclamation day saw the light.
---
People wanted a Fallout they fell in love with and they didn't get it. I'm sure they all tried it and it seems like most didn't like it. But who can blame them, FO76 is nothing like any other Fallout. It's almost a new series in the Fallout world with odd lore changes.
---
You can’t get in the bunker without doing that quest at least. That’s 200caps a day you’ll miss out on and x01 mods. 
---
&lt;3
---
Restrict it to plans, armor, equipment, and maybe ammo.  
---
Have everything in it expire like food, over a certain amount of time. That will take care of that one-star Furious Dragon no one wants, eventually. The good stuff will go fast.
---
&gt; The fact that Bethesda made this and that most of their releases have had rough starts seems to have been forgotten by that crowd.
---
I also find it hilariously ironic when people complain about the lack of polish as a reason to bash Bethesda considering both this obvious fact AND that they publicly posted a very specific "letter to the fans" that spelled this out in an even more obvious manner. 
---
 "Hey fallout fans, this is new to us, we have no idea how this will turn out so expect it to be rough and we will continue to support and fix as we go" -Bethesda
---
"Wow wtf I expected polished perfection from a AAA game, even though the early access clearly displayed it wasn't going to be that we have been lied to and mislead by big bad dirty Bethesda! This is fraud/anti-consumer/reason to riot" -outraged "fallout fans"
---
I think those people have long moved out of the corner and on to other things.
---
\^the people in this community are too nice :)
---
It’s griefing because the point of the workshop PVP mechanics are to fight over the workshop. If you’re only there to kill people and not try and use the workshop, you aren’t playing how that mechanic is intended. If you want PVP at will go play on survival. 
---
I guess it really depends, personally I played it for a bit, got to around level 12 and left since I really disliked the game, a few month later I came back and joined a few teams and now I can honestly say it's my third favourite fallout game and I'm loving it, personally once you get past level 15 it becomes less of a drag and once you accept what the game is it gets amazing but that's just my opinion, it's slowly improving and I have hope.
---
You’re a great sport for sharing ur effort. Thx. 
---
I've never been able to get vats to work at all to the point where ive given up on it as a very useful feature, to only using it to find things now.
---
maybe Ill have to push to level 15.
---
Handmade hands down 
---
I thought it was pretty funny
---
It took DCUO almost three years to fix audio chat so that it reliably worked.  It took them five to fix PVP.  
---
ESO was garbage one release and now it is very polished.  
---
It takes a lot of time to find these bugs and more to fix them. 
---
Wastelanders? What does he mean by that 
---
I do melee w/sniper as secondary on 1 build. It’s super fun and plenty strong for range and up close situations. 
---
It has to do with how many unique items the server can track at one time. Iirc this is why duping led to so many server issues. The game couldn't handle that amount of items on one server.
---
I have played Fallout since 1997, probably before you were even born. I don't like FO76 because it's not a Fallout game. Please don't call people sheep just because they don't like crappy modern video games.
---
I know that guy, maybe his name has the words Anubis, and Canabis?
---
Not at all. I never initiate PVP, but if someone initiated it with me 9/10 times they’re melee builds. This means I tend to get the first shot that deals full damage. 9/10 times, my dragon finishes what they started.
---
First off, I assume you've got the quest to find the recipe to make Nukashine?  If not, make sure you talk to Biv, then go find the password to gain entry into the store room. If you've already done all that and are just trying to use the fermenter, make sure you read the note pinned on the front of it if you've not used it before. Was having trouble using the fermenter until I read that. 
---
Farmers outfit, pitchfork, thoughts and prayers.  Only cost like three controllers per night. 
---
strange..9 out if 10 times i find a 3 star in westek..also harpers ferry gives me 3 star a fair bit..today i had a 2 star and 3 star in one circuit of harpers ferry
---
Bethesda need to stop nerfing everything and start buffing things that are lacking. Non stop nerfs just dull the game without any positives to balance things out.
---
You are doing the lord's work.
---
Many blessings to you good sir
---
They better save the best for last
---
That's the name of the Fall update in the road map
---
Yeah it's really a drag but once you get there and start doing some quests like joining different factions, exploring remains of old towns it uncovers a whole different aspect of the game that I love, I feel as if they looked at higher levelled characters and built the game from there, I'm not saying that's the right way to go about a game but it definitely gets interesting.
---
Yeah, I shouldn't doubt. So many strange things happen in this game, that anything is well within the realm of possibility.
---
Twice in Watoga I've had a 3* bot come out of the pod and just fall over dead.
---
Well, nocturnal has a sacrifice. They suck during the day. I haven’t tested much but I get the impression that unless you only fight at night, nocturnal averages out as neutral damage. 
---
6 should have stayed like that tbh
---
This is the correct answer. 
---
I'm honestly in the camp of hoping both do really well. Though honestly after seeing some of outerworlds, it looks kinda trash. I get some people are into the dated look, but that's not a date I really want to revisit. I'll have to wait and see, but my personal whimsy says nahh...
---
im going to reinstall, thank you for this.
---
While I don’t get angry when someone kills me, I also don’t ever initiate PVP. If someone initiates it with me, that means marsupial and timing tend to give me the first shot. +40% VATS critical damage, +60% rifle damage, and +10% damage to other players combined with a VATS critical headshot, means I win 9 times out of 10.
---
No problem:)
---
Bruh do you even Fallout 76?
---
 I’ve just been skipping the majority of notes since launch either because the writing goes of the page or is two small.
---
Add me if If you don't mind teaming up with a n00b on occasion "Jesterhead_MN", currently level 11. 
---
Depends on the scenario.  Combat?  Combat rifle.  Craft show?  Handmade rifle.  
---
I typically have one melee, a pump shotgun, and a sniper rifle. Occasionally, I have a pistol.
---
It's just that you mentioned launching the pvp mode, I wouldn't call it launched until the "beta" ends.
---
I agree with all of this. Most of this is things that I’ve said as well. So good on seeing other likeminded people. 
---
Those what I’d include as well:
---
Train station safe times. Entering the area of the station grants you a hard 2-3 minutes of safety. Once that’s up battle on.  
---
Yes but I think they have a faster rate of fire
---
&gt;There is no point like trying to fight back.
---
I mean, it's fun.
---
But yeah there needs to be more of a reward for time alive/time wanted. 
---
The house looks like a kitty!
---
Very mich interested, will join later
---
Dont ever hesitate to call whiners out for their entitlement 
---
If you don't have a solid group of friends check the server before you launch. If a third or more of the server is under level 60 odds are she's not going down. 
---
If you want a group, post here before entering the silo with your gamertag so people can join your server and help take her down.
---
Dang Todd looks depressed. 
---
Did I say it was? Compared to the originals this is nowhere near being a competent fallout game. That being said it doesn’t automatically mean that you should write it off as a bad game because it really isn’t. I was onboard the fallout 76 hate train for quite awhile but after I gave it a go it grew on me and I personally really enjoy it. 
---
Also just because you played the isometric games when they released doesn’t make you the arbiter on what is and isn’t a “fallout” game. 
---
Shit
---
Or possibly stolen considering its a link to your stash at your camp
---
Dude, finally some0ne agrees with me lol
---
There's probably an aspect of entitlement to some of the complaints, but speaking only for myself, after seeing the per-atom pricing model, I simply chose to never spend money on them; if they were cheaper, I'd consider it. Bethesda's focus should be on the bottom line, and lost sales should factor into that. Now, whether they'd stand to make more money by increasing sales at the cost of decreased sticker price is something we'd need their sales figures to debate, but I submit that making them aware of the potential is probably in our best interest as consumers either way. 
---
Well if we are redesigning the encounter we can count damage done to adds as well
---
Why are other people's opinions relevant to your own? Trolls on Reddit can't talk you into enjoying the game. If you don't like it, you don't like it. Plenty of other games on the market these days. Personally, I've put hundreds of hours on two platforms. I found the game to be a blast, even with the poor launch. Haven't played in a few weeks bc I need some meaty content bc I have the "been there done that" feeling with most of the game now. But yea, well worth every penny of the $60 I paid for the game. 
---
Actually, changing the order doesn’t change the final outcome. Order of operations- if it’s all multiplication, it doesn’t matter
---
How?
---
Order doesn’t matter if it’s all multiplication. Basic math- check it yourself. 
---
so i have done the quest with Nukashine and i have made some other things for him, i thought there was more quests than this. so thats it for the Wild appalachia?
---
i thought there was more :(. So i have a fermenter in my camp , you just set stuff in it an wait? thought it was sort of instant like The one in Biv's place.
---
Yeah faster rate but less per shot. I can’t confirm but it also feels like they do more damage to scorched. I doubt it but it feels like a smaller amount compared to the scorched killer and prime receivers. 
---
make sense but still it's not a player locked item :( 
---
live and learn i guess
---
I'm happy to try, but tickets I've submitted in the past has gotten a response of "your system does not meet the minimum system requirements and we cannot assist you further." (even though it does, "barely", according to an escalated support representative)
---
That's a very sad opinion to have. I feel sorry for you. 
---
I do agree that the more long-term cumulative challenges are sad rewards, but for the most part the easier ones pay out often enough to make atoms attainable in game decently
---
It does pretty decent on consoles
---
Word! I haven’t even done any events because most of them are too difficult for me to do on my own. Mainly because I don’t have the resources for it. 
---
So Rainbow Six Siege hasn't launched his Ranked system? Because it has been there since the beginning and it still says "BETA" beside it.
---
Nah, it is launched. The "Beta" label is there so you guys can say "hey, it's a beta".
---
Not if you read some of the trash posts they make in this sub.
---
Thanks dude!!!! That actually sounds like a lot of fun! 
---
I like how you commit to your characters!  and your dedication to your cowboy's love for playing the banjo
---
thanks for sharing your builds!
---
Nah it´s just tokens for an event that pops up every hour or so at watoga high school (it´s called Monster Mask), &gt;!don´t remember how much exactly but if you have like 2k or 4k (which you can make in maybe 10 times playing it) you can redeem them on a halloween vending machine for a random (and probably shitty) one star legendary. Take some time to farm but it´s kinda fun. Take a look on it!!!&lt;
---
So, unfortunately, the math doesn’t actually work the way you think- basically, AA (anti armor legendary) is 28.5% more damage IF YOU DONT have any other armor penetration. Doesn’t matter what your damage or target armor is (to a point. Once you’re doing vastly more damage than they have armor, you effectively ignore it completely).
---
Adding armor piercing effects has diminishing returns, but the order of operations doesn’t matter. 
---
"Hello human, i see you have lamp"
---
&gt;!dead meme i know!&lt;
---
Brm138
---
I used to wear urban. They need to add urban armor legendary effects!
---
There's a workshop that lets you make all the ammo without crafting material, it's at the very top of the savage divide. Every 30 seconds it creates 1 or 5 pieces of ammo depending on what ammo you are making. 5.56 creates 5 every 30 seconds. Out front there's a lead deposit so you can make even more ammo. You'll need to clear out super mutants first. The two times I had to defend there were feral ghouls and scorched.
---
This is a secure channel 
---
Well, clearly extensive use ducked up the Nightkin; I’d love to see it have some addiction effect that made you twitchy, hallucination,  etc. 
---
Sorry Xbox1 
---
What did you trade it might be 
---
Alright, what's wrong with camps
---
Well, I think they also do that to keep some enemy variety. You see the same thing with the One Silent Night event. 
---
&gt; Why do we not have 1/2 and 1/4 sized versions of laminate flooring?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We have the crappy wood and steel grate versions... It shouldn't be that hard...
---
Trying to build a place the other day and got frustrated I couldn't do a 1/2 floor of the dark wood. :(
---
Drill is on loot table so not sure bug is the right word-we'd need them to change the loot table not a bug to fix I guess-making me think it'll always be there 
---
Fair enough. Thank you kind stranger.
---
No not really 
---
Uhhhhh.... what?
---
initially, I had my concerns, especially when I found out I'd have to pay again for PS+ before I could play.  Coupled with the negativity here at the time - I was going to return it, but by the time I got to that point, it was selling for less than I paid for it.  
---
But its still fallout.  and I really like the franchise.  So I bit the bullet and installed.  Ran across a few of the bugs, but nowhere near as bad as what I was reading here.
---
at about 200 hours in...200/60 = thats what, 30c / hr?  
---
And still haven't made it to the east side of the map, so the cost per hour is obviously going to go even lower.
---
What else can you do that costs that little?
---
Most Excellent!🤟
---
I sang your title. 
---
I can't remember, but I remember showing up and seeing the fight zone that had the concrete barriers in the main area.  Friday Night Fight Club I can remember the fella saying.   Either way, killer and fun idea.
---
Dont like having to pay to move my camp, i was fine being a lone wanderer looking for my things before hand 
---
Love it, thank you!
---
Best way ive found is a group of 5 or 6. Preferably 3 melee to handle the ads. At least 2 heavy gunners to focus on the queen and larger targets. Also either have cryo grenades or cryolaters on the melee users  to freeze the queen when she lands to give the heavy gunners a good amount of time burn through some ammo, also allows the melee toons to get up close without taking as much damage 
---
Thats frickin awesome
---
Pretty sure it’s called survival mode, you’re ranked for how long you survive, not for how often you kill. Although all you have to do is look at those stats if that’s what you’re interested in 🤷‍♀️
---
Crafted beer vends for less than the material that goes into it to prevent potential unforseen money exploits. Many an RPG have been hit with infinite money glitches where you can buy crafting material, make something out of it that sells for more than the cost of the crafting material, and then you can do it over and over again.
---
You can find boiled and dirty water laying around, but the fastest way to get dirty water is to gather it yourself. I don't know if any perks reduce rads for gathering dirty water.
---
The flux is easy for me. 5 fiber optics a shot though? No, that’s the rarest material I use
---
True that, where it lacks NPCs and character interaction/questing for them, it totally makes up for it (obviously IMO) in lore and exploration. Many of the lore sources from past titles like terminals, notes, and situational story telling is above and beyond, and the map itself so much bigger, prettier, and full of interesting and unique locations. 
---
Its not the big traditional fallout story arc and side stories of wastes like we are used to, but its not devoid of interesting story elements either, you just have to be willing to look a bit harder. 
---
Three weapons. TSE laser rifle, AAE laser rifle, explosive heal on crit laser rifle.
---
No sorry it wasn’t me I just made it I do know someone who said they did one a while back 
---
fair point.
---
Put them all on a paper bag and forget about them.
---
I was trying to find ways to enjoy the game, i decided to reinstall to try it, thanks for your reply
---
I dont understand reddit XD Thx for your answer!  (+karma ;) ) 
---
I am mostly melee and I still need tons of junk, mostly because I forget the material coat reduction perks exist when I go to craft, repair, construct buildings.
---
Ballistic fiber, cement, aluminum these are the things I need most, off the top of my head.
---
There’s still a massive issue with energy weapons in that Armor Piercing effects do not work for them. 
---
Also for rifleman energy weapons can’t be silenced, so it’s bad for sneaky builds. Frontline soldiers only...
---
Well that sounds like more RNG BS. Looking forward to that 😀
---
Oh ok, thank you I appreciate it
---
Or when they ask you to craft 76 thick blood tequila while under the effects of cranberry moonshine while wearing the beer hat while naked
---
Well when you have a 95% chance to hit and it misses 10 shots I notice it. Was doing SBQ yesterday wasn't even using vats and it missed about 20 shots. Actually prime weapons are amazing people are just lazy and haven't tested them and don't want to get the materials for them. 3 of us took down the SBQ in 4 or 5 minutes yesterday. All prime weapons.
---
Yeah it does. It's called being experienced.
---
I still get the quest. Maybe not literally on the daily but I’m not chasing it; I still have seen it pop up when I’m in the ash heap (just yesterday actually)
---
I recently picked it up, wanted it on release but am glad I waited. It is time consuming like ESO but I'm enjoying it. Don't listen to people who claim "it's not fallout" , IT IS FALLOUT and it's hella fun to explore while jamming to the Appalachian radio (which needs more songs btw). 
---
If ya want a quick tickle play fortnite or Apex (which is actually fun..) but don't join the herd of idiots who never played it or don't have patience for exploration or Beth's bugs ("perfection is for the weak") and remember Fallout is about surviving in a broken world and making the best with of what you have 😉.
---
Tobacco was never grown in WV 
---
No probs, I had it saved it on my phone. Not sure who posted it originally though. 
---
Then....don't move your camp?  It's not like you're forced to push the button.
---
Thanks for sharing! I missed the panel think it’ll be uploaded somewhere shortly?
---
They're all 0 weight. Dump them in you stash and avoid that tab like the plague.
---
Despite stating multiple times that I don’t mind dropping $10-$20 here or there as long as it is enough to get a few things 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
1. is really interesting, and really makes me want to try it(if we can't trade with adventure).
---
3. Would have preferred scalable size 1-4, it's not always that one can get 4 friends for an event that may take a while.
---
4. Yes, thank you.
---
5. Is interesting with player vending.
---
Not many opinions about the rest.
---
It’s much more horrifying than any scorchbeast.
---
Yes, one of the early patches redid lighting to be less performance intensive without changing the look of it. Shadows have also had some work done, as I don't notice them drawing in. I'm sure they draw in, but I don't notice it happening any more. There are still areas that have oddly bad performance. One is the platforming challenge in the hills to the east of Flatwoods and West of Camp McClintock. At certain times of day if you stand in a particular spot and look in a particular direction your frame rate will plummet. The Messenger event spawns here, so the easiest way to find it is to wait for it to spawn and look at the Mr. Handy that's sitting on the ground.
---
I recall someone doing this already and determining it was debunked. These people persist regardless  
---
I saw further down you were under level 15? I usually give games a solid 10-15 hours before I decide whether I like it or not. With any rpg I make sure I'm past that initial introduction to learn mechanics etc before I decide. Sounds like you left the vault, walked 50 yards and said "this sucks" and quit. Lol. 
---
I couldn't agree with you more!  I was thinking this myself when I read this change. With one vendor from each faction (besides Enclave) all centrally located, there's really no NEED to go out to the actual faction locations in the world.... which I thoroughly enjoyed doing. I see at least 5 differently designed locations in the world every day, and with this change, what's the point now?  \*shrug\*  As someone else said earlier in this thread, keep going in this direction (making things easier and easier with less effort required) and one day we'll get a patch that lets us login to the game, sit back with a snack and a drink, and watch the game play itself. 
---
And I have a hard time believing anyone has any good experiences with other players in this game.
---
I have a hard time believing that anyone who wins both the cleanest toilet award and award of recognition for eating mystery meat would be anything but a genius who is at the top of their field and totally not a random crazy person who's being used as a guinea pig.
---
WS nuke zone last weekend...L45, I think, I found an untracite deposit, and was immediately mobbed by about 12 L68 scorched.  Had never seen scorched there before.
---
It's erroneously on the loot table even though it can't receive legendary effects. That is a bug.
---
Anyone got a Gilded minigun and willing to sell?
---
Idk about that. People can't take stuff out of your stash so it's maybe the same as that. But because it's an extra container like the artillery they just made it that way. 
---
I have about 400 to 1000 of every material except, Aluminum, Ballistic fiber, cement, I run melee but I use a .50 Cal sniper so I need lead occasionally too.
---
Yeah if it’s designed for 4 players we’ll definitely need some form of matchmaking or way to communicate with others on your server
---
I got a bug, and its me getting stuck in  any crafting station I make stuff in, after i exit i get stuck, after patch
---
^this
---
Blocker + Fireproof + Adamantium Skeleton + Lone Wanderer + Nerd Rage + Serendipity +Dodgy +Evasive + Grounded + Scaly Skin +Blocker + Chems + Food + Armor.
---
Serendipity won't work in PA, but Emergency Protocols Torso Mod sure will.
---
Also the underground location(s) we saw in the trailer are [dungeons, and an Arktos Lab of some kind.](/spoiler) 
---
Also, on point 5, my interpretation was that persistent CAMPs was kind of a hope/dream to get to, to let players have a bit more impact on the world even when they aren't there. 
---
Why would this get a down vote 😂😂😂
---
Why would you think this would happen?  There’s literally no reason it would.
---
Okay....don't build a camp then? No one is forcing you...
---
Honestly yeah. I have a bunch of friends on discord and we all bonded over Fallout. Now that the game is out, we have been discussing lore and what not and one of my closest friends was saying 76 lore suck and then he went into a full on rant about the game and how nobody asked for multiplayer fallout, which is false I’ve been asking for years. I asked him how many hours he has in the game, and he said he hadn’t ever even played it. How can you go on a whole half hour rant about a game you’ve never played? Just play it, give it a shot. People like that are like little kids saying the don’t like certain foods, despite having never eaten the food before. It’s ridiculous and frustrating.
---
Awesome. More ways to get screwed. 
---
"Turn in 10 3* weapons! 
---
To get 1 chance! 
---
To turn your main weapon into a drill, or a 1* wood piece!"
---
No thanks, Todd.
---
It might have to do with the special effect the fermenter has on speeding up fermentation. There must be a reason they don't allow other players to use it.
---
Of course I'm a hoarder, it's a Fallout game
---
or don't have one in the first place, you don't have to have one.
---
I'm having the same issue. Was it beer for the drink? That doesn't increase luck so I guess that could be it?
---
What I'm suggesting is it's intentional and adds to risk-I've never seen a Beth employee acknowledge it as such (not that means anything definitively) so makes me think it's intentional 
---
The amount of crappy 1 star trapper armor I get is insane. Looking forward to being able to turn it into something useful.
---
Yeah, he definitely said #5 was a "wishlist" item.
---
Was having this issue a few days ago. It was working properly at first and then after awhile it just falls off completely and does 0 damage. 
---
It was oak holler for mine. But yeah any beer would do it. 
---
They're adding a legendary vendor on May 23rd (yes, two months!). Todd described it as a token system. Maybe keep it and see what the vendor can do for you when they add it.
---
You sound like an idiot
---
Oh my god yes.
---
Likewise!
---
I *really* hope there is a way to lock effects.
---
For example if i like my primary effect i want to lock it and only re-roll the other 2 effects...
---
Otherwise it's complete bs
---
Good point about ballistic fiber. If I was running regular armor instead of PA I would need that
---
I never thought to use cryo grenades or cryolater that’s good to know 
---
LOL, Sorry to disappoint, but maybe I was not clear but he made it sound like you would only be rolling for different legendary effects. 
---
are you using vats?
---
Prime heavy weapons. Takes 3 of us to take her down in record time.
---
So game is 10/10? 
---
I have spent probably 5 hours playing it, im level 14
---
Maybe they can implement this w/ an ability to stay on the same server. Ex if your CAMP is placed, you will always be on that server when you login, and then you have to move it to hop to another
---
I really like that effect and wish that other chems or drinks would have a visual effect with them
---
hunger pangs for mods, here in console-ville
---
any chance you are PC using xbox controller?  would LOVE nuka torso and helmet paint job for t51 (i don't even have any t51 parts)
---
Before you go to Whitesprings, make sure there aren't any low level players around.  If they are there, you'll end up piggybacking their spawns.  That's where the 9/15s come from.  
---
Dunno Man, Phoenix is a badass and doesn’t put up with other bots shit. 
---
I just thought of something else.  It would be nice to be able to sell/trade blueprints.   
---
People have put in a lot of work in some of the buildings.  It would be nice to be able to sell/trade blueprint sets if you find a style you like. The method to create some building styles isn’t always easy or obvious.  
---
I know, I wasn't really serious. Was more joking about drills and 1* wood pieces *still* dropping from 3* mobs.
---
That's not how it's going to work at all. It wont turn your weapon into another weapon, it will roll new effects for it.
---
This one too.  The easiest place you can get 100 per lvl 50 bot.  Easiest of course if OP has done Mayor For a Day.
---
Yeah people can't even take a hint on this when my camp is right next door and it's pretty obvious I'm doing it to get the event done before all my fences are busted and they kill Fred (the horn blowing mannequin).
---
The group I run with uses the ice machine outside the clubhouse.  Make a loop and drop your trash...
---
😶...
---
It's like they took gambling and made the odds much, much worse
---
Wouldn’t it be cool if wastelanders introduced human npcs from one of the vaults, could possibly have that missing child all grown up. 
---
I did some quick googling and [you're wrong WV did grow tobacco](https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/736) 
---
I only looked it up because I know they grow/grew tobacco here in Maryland and in Virginia so it got me wondering.
---
Gather water rad free wearing power armor
---
You know, when you think about it, it's odd how much better this game would be if they just fixed the server crashes. So many more interesting aspects of it are basically worthless because of them. 
---
Pretty good yeah that’s quite a grind for a week even! A lot of late nights I would imagine, good you have a team to help out too.
---
I know what you mean though, I play mainly to build and service my camp so I’m constantly tweaking and adding stuff to my it, it’s always constantly taking shape! I only spend caps on plans for that kinda stuff so I’ll keep a lookout at Watoga station. 
---
Saves wasting ammo on ticks and low lvl scorched. 
---
Yeah, I am thinking you managed to tag the guy somehow and he found out when he tried tickling you and it hurt. Was probably as much a surprise to him as you.
---
Doesn’t seem to be a way to drop keys yet. and holotapes just stash them. Keep in mind your stash can’t be 800/800 or they won’t fit. 
---
To many people want this game to be easier, when it’s overly easy as it is. Just increase the odds of getting a 3 star item by a little, until it is a reasonable amount. The queen won’t be worth doing, not will trading be worth it if everyone keeps whining about rare items needing to be less rare or if everyone ends up with the best gear. It will first be “oh I want guaranteed 3 stars”. Then it will be “it should always give good 3 star items” and then the population leaves because some dumbasses don’t enjoy a challenge.
---
Look at the pvp servers. People wanted them. Now they got them. Now it’s a farm fest for snipers and no one else has a chance. Yet ranged is always complaining that melee is overpowered but refuse to strategize against melee. It’s beyond idiotic complaining at this point. Think of what the game will be once you have everything and everything is common. You’re asking to destroy the game. 
---
Maaaaaybe... Wink wink.
---
Its a 10 for sure.
---
10/16.666666666666
---
Nice! I’ve looked into a spot in the very upper left corner of the map where an acid resource is, and it’s and awesome spot, but I could never justify paying 50 caps to get from there to Watoga. Now it won’t be a problem at all!

I have to disagree that this is someone voicing entitlement... the OP clearly states that the real world dollar values of digital asthetics is absurdly high.
---
$14 of real cash for a single digital power armor skin, which could just as easily buy you a used game (or a copy Fo76 when it's on sale), just shows how inflated the Atom economy is.
---
It's not about being incapable to obtain atoms, it's about how little their worth is in comparison to real currency 
---
I can probably do better just gathering mats and crafting with ammosmith and super duper though, don’t need to deal with other lazy people looking for free ammo.
---
Starts around 25 mins in
---
Yeah it's a real slog getting that ballistic fiber:/
---
Yeah they forgot the micro in "micro transactions".  They're probably banking on the few that will drop hundreds of dollars to show off rare skins, rather than marketing cheaper skins to more people.  I'm sure they have their calculations about supply and demand for maximizing profitability.
---
It does bother me a little, but I understand why they would do it that way and honestly I'm just happy it's only cosmetic stuff.
---
they've demonstrated that they can do it. I can see Cranberry Moonshine having a red tinged effect... etc
---
You're right that you don't understand.
---
It's okay that people who like the franchise, don't like this game. It's not for everyone. 
---
Yeah, the only time I haven't been able to get a daily from biv is if I started playing really late the night before, and so it hasn't been 20 hours yet. Other than that one time, it's always just taken several interactions for him to get down to business.
---
Ultracite weapon’s do extra damage to Scorched creatures, and are less effective against anything else. 
---
Times lockout needs to be included and seen that it’s needed. 
---
Yea. IMO that's barely enough time to get outta the vault and get anything substantial going. Plus (idk if you've played other fallouts or survival type games) the beginning is always tough and a pain in the ass. But once you get over that hump and learn how to play, it can be a lot of fun. Good luck out there in the wasteland. May West Virginia treat ya well. 
---
I think it could be up to 4 people and not exactly 4.
---
Yes. Settings/accessibility to enable
---
PS button+ square to zoom, circle to cancel. 
---
It is a set zoom. (Btw Xbox has a upon too. I heard someone say it did and I thought ps4 had to have one too and found it) and you can scroll around the screen to magnify what you need. You do lose control of the game so if there is something you need to zoom in on while holding a button, you can't. 
---
I just don’t want to see a post where these people get mad at Bethesda for not having created the secret ending they hypothesized.
---
Great effort. 
---
I don't know what's been going on lately, but I've gotten auto-stim pieces 8 out of the last 10 times I've gotten 3* armor. Was actually starting to wonder if they were trying to lower drop rates on higher tier armor, or if my luck stinks.
---

---
I’m not going to go into full HYPE-r drive over Wastelanders, but the more info we’re getting on it the more it points to human NPCs.
---
I’ve said it since the beginning, but my theory on how they’re going to treat this game is that they’re going to treat it like ESO. Every year they’re going to add small DLCs they add fluff quests, and QoL mechanics to the game then annually add one massive DLC that sort if overhauls the theme of the game and that will be the theme for the year. I think they’re going to change the menu music and background as well to fit the theme. This year is reclamation hence the triumphant music we get in the menu. Once “Wastelanders” comes I’m betting there will be a menu theme similar to the other Fallout titles 
---
A lot of people feel like they can't give the game a chance. They devoted too much time and emotion to hating it.
---
Eh, my hope is they set it up so you can pay a few caps to roll for all 3 effects or more to just roll for either your 1st, 2nd, or 3rd legendary effect. There are only seven 2\* effects and nine 3\* effects on ranged and if we get to choose to reroll for just those effects then the odds are not bad. 
---
I have a full set of the urban and forest with deep pocket on all pieces and dont even use them ever.. anyone interested hit me up on xbox.. if not it be hoarded lil
---
No I get it, and doing some research online today confirms what you’re saying. So it’s on me to get a picture and trust me I’m racing home so I can do so. Cause now I’m super confused. They were there multiple times, multiple days, plain as day. I didn’t know they weren’t supposed to exist when I saw them. So let me check when I get on and I’ll show proof as soon as I can 
---
Honestly, I was one of those people that liked Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but felt like Fallout 4 was just missing something. I feel like Fallout 76 kind of reinvigorated my love for the series
---
Then help me by explaining it please. ive got several hundred hours in this game and have never had a problem killing people at of 260 or 50 or 25 finding loot 
---
Had that happen with (I think) a 0-star one once, which then detonated and nearly killed me.  AND the corpse blew back into the tube and the door closed it in (not that it would have had any loot).
---
I've been a bit gun shy around those tubes ever since :P
---
I get quests from him all the time that aren't affected by the drink and I can complete them fine. For example, yesterday I had to test my endurance but the beer I had to drink had no effect on endurance. Completed just fine. Inversely, I've had trouble completing the melee challenge and the drink definitely had an effect on strength. For the critical one, I had to do 2 critical shots before it finally took one. \*shrugs\* It just works. 
---
I had same problem. Try stash your Tesla and change server few times, it solved my problem.
---
I'm the opposite, never really got into the previous titles, I love the atmosphere of 4 so much, and 76 is just too barren of a place for me.
---
I just had a thought: what if we could place our CAMP device anywhere, but only build in certain areas? Like now, you can't squat in many buildings because Bethesda doesn't want a bunch of people building inside, example Morgan Airport. But if you could "squat" there, it'd be really cool. Or a random apartment in a "town". Maybe there could be a limited time you could do it, say a 24 hour period, and you'd have to move you CAMP device. These could be "free" moves, whereas if you've got a built structure, then it would cost to move as it does now. It'd be cool to spend the night in an abandoned school bus, and then move on the next day. 
---
I went on a spoiler bender a while back. Dumped every note and holotape I could (including several for completed quests) into the suitcase at Morgantown. Some level 5 probably got a deluge of "Investigate &lt;X&gt;" quests way ahead of schedule.
---
Levels after 50 (60 if you want to be granular about perks) are pointless and not even remotely a measure of a characters survivability/ability.
---
Thanks for tuning into the panel guys :)
---
Well, they removed the syringer for the same reason and they said all legendaries will drop a legendary item now, so im assuming this is an oversight on their part to keep the drill. Maybe youre right though!
---
I got a couple of prime plans from a SBQ a few fights ago and was giddy about it.  Better than a bloodied rolling pin.  
---
Hasn't the environment in Fallout gone through ENOUGH?! Now you wanna take that sweet sweet freedom juice out of the ground, turn it into plastic and put a bunch of Greenhouse Gases into the atmosphere?!
---
Hasn't the Post Nuclear Apocalyptic Wasteland seen enough?!
---
I posted in your other thread about this.  It's not bugged, it's because u traded for the games.  Trading for them doesn't trigger the challenge.  If you already have the game in your inventory it doesn't count for the challenge when you pick it up in the wild.  I traded for wastelad and it didn't count, and when I found it in the wild I dropped my traded copy and picked up the new one.  That did trigger the challenge.  
---
Honestly, it wouldn't be a terribly bad idea if the max health of these enemies was reduced a bit to compensate.
---
Just as an example, say the SBQ max health is 8000 right now. She heals to max at half, so her effective hp would be about 12k. If the legendary health was changed to be a full health heal per star, and her max health was changed to 3000, the health would be pretty close to the same, and you'd be able to track her health more.
---
There's also the possibility of flagging certain mobs as "bosses" that could limit their effective healing, preventing the unkillable boss tank enemies from occurring. 
---
Are any of y’all on PS4?
---
*Vault Boy Thumbs Up and Heart emotes but in text*
---
The health regen bug is occasionally making a reappearance. Regardless of ranged weapon. Did One Violent Night last night and had 3 ghouls in the final wave that were unkillable. They healed every bit of damage done. Only way to finally kill them was with melee.  Couldn't even cripple them with enforcer. Definitely the hardest fight I've had in this game and there were 3 of us trying to take them out.
---
Thanks I saw that after responding to this and forgot to edit my comment. 
---
Yeah, but the item is his and there happens to be a lock on it.  If it wasn't locked, there'd be no issue, like taking water from purifier or stuff from an unlocked extractor, or just opening an unlocked door.
---
But the lock exists on his item, so picking it gets you a wanted.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Was mainly thinking of crafting to sell since it doesn't expire, right?
---
That sounds a lot better now 😁
---
I guess the key part is keeping the primary
---
Play Prequel meme quotes over the mic while stalking someone.  Also some asshole destroyed parts of my base.
---
Yeah I feel ya, I'm just being negative about it now so I'm not bummed if it ends up being poorly implemented. Pretty stoked to have something to do with all the bad legendaries I get though! 
---
I'd keep it, consider pairing with an Instigating Sniper or Lever for PvE.
---
I don't understand why we cant make multiple marks/notes on our own maps. Seems like a rather important thing to do in an apocalyptic world. I'd love to be able to mark where ive found certain mobs, clusters of crops/plants, or resource spawns. Sure that map you linked is amazing but I want one in game, filled with info that only I made.
---
I would play it if it didn't have the minimap markers for the leaders
---
[I sorta called it] about a week ago.  Not really a surprise,  I figured tokens were  the  most  likely mechanic, seeing as how it's a function that already exists  in-game with several things.
---
Not when you have reactive plates.  I’ve reversed one shot fools ever since I got it.  Best mod ever! 
---
I actually just did my first two SBQ fights last week. First one was a wash since no one showed up (Scorched Earth wasn't even active so that was kind of unwelcome surprise). Second time was nice with tons of payers to fight with me and adds to murder for nuke materials. I got two plans (one I had already), 1-2 2* legendaries from her and another plan I already had from another Scorhbeast.
---
While I found the event fun I have to admit it would have been nice to be a bit more rewarding on the plans/legendaries side of things. I used all of my Gatling gun and plasma ammo having to fight her and so many adds. I also died 2-3 times and lost my junk because I got knocked into those green pits which I thought nukes were supposed to be closing in the first place.
---
Is that all they talked about?
---
Perfect thanks!
---
I’m soo late to this game. I gotta get on this asap. Last game got tiresome for me (Anthem) 
---
This one seems like it has so much to do you can just get lost in the world 
---
*thumbs up*
---
I use that build; basically take advantage of all perks that help DR without power armor
---
See and even the map I provided only let's you make so many of them. That's why I'd like something in game tied straight to the map so that 
---
I don't think timed lockout is needed because most people that have horded legendarys have not hoarded crap. In most cases people are hoarding gear that has 2 out of 3 good legendary effects. They are not going to turn that stuff in for tokens so they will have to do a lot of farming just like everyone else to find crap to turn in for tokens. 
---
I think a lockout is inevitable because bethesda does not see this as fixing the broken system as much as they see it as relief for complaining customers. They like to heavily control the rate people gain gear and so a lockout is probably guaranteed. 
---
They discussed other things about the game but none of it qualifies as "news".
---
A theory:
---
Lifesaving armor could be part of the answer, you are killing them, but they pop back up out of it. Maybe along with that perk that auto stims you, as well. Those stim effects seem instantaneous.
---
This would be awesome. I also wish if a weapon or armor that scraps for plastic would tag it like it does the other junk when you have plastic marked. 
---
Roger, thanks everyone! :D
---
Have you heard of Narendra Modi?
---
I'm not trying to be a dick I geunully dont get your agruement ive never experienced the level disparity that is being claimed 
---
I just suicide every time I get close to top 3. There’s a cliff near my camp and I can reset my timer with no issues. It’s stupid that I have to do this but some people are just way stronger than me and I am just free caps against those fully geared players.
---
gotcha.
---
i think your gun is a huge set back, its perks are situational really and ineffective against most mobs your going to farm, gun you have would prolly be better used in a pvp build, explosive to stagger, radiation damage.. pve not so much, i have a rifle build using an Anti armor lever dmg was in the 140-150ish range, upgraded to an AAE and around the 170s, also have several other situational rifles i use most run 150-220 dmg.
---
at 100 id say just save up 2-3k caps get in trade groups buy yourself a good, lever/sniper/handmade and roll with that build some levels bank some points and then when ya hit about 130ish lvl take a good look at your character and respec to make it a lil better (it can be done i had to respec around level 160 due to tse nerf, took about 40 levels, now lvl 232 with another 30 points banked).
---
i also have 2 alts, one is a lvl 96 melee, the other is lvl 18 pistol build, and 2 mule characters to store stuff i find on.  
---
i jump back and forth between alts all the time, even in parties with friends, "hey im gonna jump on melee before we do this be back in a min" quick char swap and back in to running stuff. like clearing westtek i prefer melee, going scorchbeast hunting i prefer range cause i get bored on melee waiting for things to land.   
---
to be honest about the only thing kinda a hassle on leveling an alt is just finding plans again or buying plans again, for the most part you will level a 2nd char faster than the first simply because ya know where to go, what to do, my melee thats 96 is only lil over 3 weeks old and melee being as over powered as it is i was taking her in to whitesprings at lvl 30 killing lvl 60 ghouls, had her in nuke zones at 35 1 shoting the scorched, dogs, bugs, ticks and such on the ground, sneak in a hit on queen, mirelurk queens, fog crawlers or any beasts i could find then pray i got away before they 1 shot me back. coudnt do much to the queen but id stay around the heavy weapons people and kill adds on them so they didnt have to look away from the queen or worry for long what was hitting on them.   
---
either path you decide to choose right now is a relatively easy one. youre 100 so levels are easy to come by still (grab a shotgun hit a nuke zone spray everything and wait for the mobs to get killed just make sure ya tag everything possible.) 
---
youre also low enough level that creating an alt would catch up to your lvl 100 relatively quickly if you wanted to spec an entirely different build. there would be less guesswork involved, youd have a plan maybe even a roadmap from a build program, and you already know the areas and places to level to get back to 100 faster than what it originally took you.  
---
if your on ps4 look me up wouldnt mind helping ya get things goin back in right direction for ya, if not then im sure others on your platform could as well and stay safe in the wasteland.
---
I like the handmade better for the simple fact it doesn't share the same ammo type as my lever action.
---
Maybe it won't be perpetually mid-October
---
Wild Appalachia is a series of quests, features and new content rolling out bit by bit over the coming months, April 9th brings the player vending and the Shear Terror quest I think it’s called (more info on that in this weeks inside the vault web page), not sure of the date but there’s also the Ever Upwards scout quest coming, legendary vendor, vault raids etc etc (see roadmap). Biv and his little repeatable drinking daily quests is just one small part of Wild Appalachia
---
Barn designs rock.  I have a pretty large one overlooking Huntersville 
---
Fallout is great but this game is a continuation of fo4 base building and crafting. Which I absolutely did not care for at all. What else is going to sell me?
---
Ultracite weapons seem weirdly inconsistent. I have an Ultracite Gatling laser for my heavy weapons character. I can say for a fact that it does more damage than a regular Gatling laser. 
---
However, that doesn't seem to be the case with rifles and pistols based on what I have seen so far. But I haven't unlocked all the mods yet either.
---
I’m a stealth marksman. Armour is pretty crap but a chameleon is a must. Since I don’t hop in PA every chance I get. I run ironclad, sun kissed, and have the healing factor mutation. 
---
Matty has started using way too much salt for my likes recently
---
It's been happening to me alot too. I just exit the builder menu and come back, usually works on the 1st try for me. Really annoying tho
---
Nuka Dark &gt; Whiskey. Its affected by both Cola Nut and the perk that increases the effect of alcoholic drinks. You can get like 6+ Strength from it. Super easy to craft them too now.
---
I’ll accept that Pepsi challenge ever time with my mutations (namely electrically charged) and reactive plates.  I can’t tell you how shocked the melees are that sneak up and try to gank and end up eating their own shit sandwich without me lifting my weapon.  If they have their mic on its pretty amusing.  
---
Yea what lvl and are you older than 20?
---
Rude awakening perhaps, but at least they do seem to be awake now...and they'll be the better for it! 😂
---
I got jacked up hard in survival last night by a Handy Blade. Must have been bloodied or something. It was a little embarrassing. I can take a solid hit from a power fist easy but get killed in 2 seconds by a weed wacker?
---
Yeah I’m having better luck at Watoga because none of them really come down there and I got to do my first queen. Figured that’s what it was though!
---
I'm sure it isn't that, because I never got their HP below 50%
---
When did they tweak scrapper?  And which guns give plastic when scrapped?
---
Stealth rifle build. PA is a hindrance for me and in a fight I can kill people in power armor easily because my weapons and perks make there armor useless. 
---
I got assassin knuckles one time. It was a 3* but the other two weren't that great 😂
---
I hope that's the case, had quite a few bad session on dungeons in wow with random groups.
---
I think the system will let you reroll for individual effects but I also think that the cost for doing so will be much more expensive than rerolling say all 3. 
---
On the other hand they could opt for a system that lets you reroll them in order. IE you cant reroll the 2* without also rerolling the 3* and you cant reroll the 1* without also rerolling the 2* and 3*.  
---
You're not alone. Can confirm it on PS4 too. Exiting the build menu and then getting back in seems to fix it for me. If I was to hazard a guess, it may be the wire glitch from FO4 haunting us. Same mechanic, it seems, but unable to do it.
---
If you dont like it no one else can make you. 
---
Once mod support comes out, we will be fine 
---
I sell hats to vendors for caps, I feel your pain, I leave all my crap drops on the ground because hats weight less and only cost 1 cloth to make. It is not even worth it to haul that junk to a vendor to sell it. 
---
&gt; We move in and kill him because I dunno, fuck it. 
---
This is highly relatable to me
---
Honestly more than I was expecting. Also surprised they spoke of wastelanders rather than nuclear winter which is closer. Hoping this means new info is already on its way(maybe an upcoming Inside the Vault)
---
I came from anthem, buddy and I bought it to play together after having fun with Destiny, but its just boring after you beat the story. Grinded for awhile and gave up to go try FO76 when it went on sale.
---
Wow, thanks for the info, i really found it odd theyd cap at what.. well its now a bigger cap, but im pretty sure in fallout 4 you would go higher than that before level 10
---
From your lips to Todd's ear.
---
That actually makes a lot of sense as to why I normally see the suitcases used over other containers. Many thanks for that!
---
Ignoring potential DPS differences, I'd take the handmade every time simply based on it having less (and more predictable) recoil.
---
I’m lvl 91 and I’m 19 
---
r/yesyesyesyesno
---
I think I called it when it was announced but my post was downvoted to oblivion because people hat the idea of a new currency. I kinda hope the tokens are tradeable because caps are not worth a damn and tokens will at least give the trade economy something of value to trade with. 
---
It’s not that bad just turn down the volume 
---
I was gonna say it's probably related to the fact a bunch of hacks were released recently, aimbots and radar hacks... Bethesda has yet to comment on it as far as I'm aware... but then I saw you said "XBox" and I have no idea if any of them actually work on an xbox.
---
Could just be the xbox community, I remember people did that in Armored Core For Answer, too.
---
Laser weapons, golf clubs, billardque, superhammer. These are the ones, I know.
---
Yes no yes yes maybe yes no
---
I saw someone say the same thing about their Gatling Laser too while I was reading around, it's what confused me.
---
I'm just happy to  get  rid  of  excess legendary items, I've   been saving up, and it'll be nice to offload.
---
No idea, however I'm gonna go hang out there and see if I hear anything
---
So I built my base once and never touched it again so... obviously the fun is in killing all different types of creatures, leveling up, making that perfect character, having fun with friends, events. Etc
---
Ugh time to start hoarding even more. 
---
It's much faster making your own ammo. Plus that factory is always getting contested because people don't know any better.
---
Alright I'm getting off work soon. Send me a request BuddyBumpkin and we can do a SBQ. Probably get on around 4 might have to wait for a couple guys but we will run you through the silo and show you what we do to beat her.
---
Hell yes man. That’s the crack addicted lab rat phenomenon in me, I just keep grinding away hoping for unique drops. Finding something for the first time in game is my favorite. 
---
Oh and finding rare legendary items making them better
---
I feel like that selection screen is almost borderline trolling everyone to just click on the wrong option.
---
Nice story
---
I have not tried but have heard that the combat rifle uses less AP in vats than the handmade.
---
Hope vault  raids allow for smaller groups. I'm a  2-man team, I'd rather it just be us  than having to play with random people,  especially since we  take our time.
---
I disagree. I’ve seen a lot of people hoarding most 1* and the others. Mostly due to not knowing how the system would work. At least on Xbox. 
---
At the very least they allow the gaining of token to as much as you can get per trip. Make them non tradable and that at least will help control the inflation and whatnot. Maybe limit the rolling to 5-8 per day/20 hr. 
---
Before I even got to the end I immediately heard Rowan Atkinson's character exclaiming that exact line. Eets a race! Eets a RACE!
---
I often hear what sounds like mineral extractors in the most random, not at all possible, places. 
---
The hear pip sounds used as samples for the original score by Zhur. 
---
Really seems like I’m being followed pretty much constantly in Toxic Valley 
---
So.. maybe? 
---
I tried to do this, and nope. You can scrap only a very small portion of objects that don't give you mats. 
---
It will turn all your good armor and weapons into wood and rolling pins :)
---
He’s a leader to HIS people.
---
You can "bulldoze" some objects buy placing a camp item on them. Like a simple mat
---
Damn... It just happened to me ........
---
Ypu can make small trees, small rocks and branches disappear if you have a foundation over them orther objects that can do such. But you can't scrap anything yourself un a camp
---
&gt;  He can be the face of Bethesda, but it’s not fair to only do so when it’s convenient, and then fail to publicly support his developers/community folks during the bad times.  
---
Not fair? TBH it sounds like you want him to be your own personal punching bag you can talk shit to when things were bad. He did his job and hyped the product, if anything Pete going MIA when the game launched was more worrying considering he was actually handling community feedback. But at the same time I rather them just continue to work on the game and make it better like they have been. 
---
I'm sure he was leading his company from within just fine. Look at the FO76 and Anthem subs after launch, that shit made me embarrassed to be part of the communities. There's a lot of people who don't know how to create constructive feedback and just like to shit everywhere. No wonder why devs and execs stop communicating. 
---
The vaults are for multiplayer raids? Oh. (Cries in solo player)
---
Mr Bean needs to be the first NPC in the wastes. BE THE SODA make this happen!!!
---
Oh and exploring beautiful landscapes on your Xbox One X in 4K HDR glory, missions etc
---
The fact that everything you do actually matters, once you finish Fallout 3, NV, 4 no one's going to give a s***. 
---
But you actually have something to show for as it's a continuation on Fallout 76
---
You can farm logs. But that’s about it. 
---
They are not animals..look at them and they spawn scorched with them
---
I saw something about that on the wiki as well, about how anti armor only adds a set amount of damage, but surely that cant be completely true as armor itself blocks damage differently depending on how much damage is coming in? Also, what would be the benefit in using anti armor at all instead of bloodied with even half the effect active?
---
No answer for A or B, but at the PAX panel Todd basically confirmed that you would trade legendary items to the new vendor in exchange for tokens which would be used to re-roll for different effects on the weapons you want to keep.
---
All I know is that I've been hoarding every single lightweight 2-3 star item I've found since the announcement. I have an epic collection of assorted knives, walking canes, pitchforks, weightless arms, etc...
---
&gt; tiny stashes. 
---
You must not have been around when it was half of what it is today
---
Combat can also switch between .45 and .38. I’d say if your using rifles and have the weight to spare it’s worth it to carry both. One for all the time use and the other for harder enemies or players.
---
Yeah. I have two characters over level 50, been playing since the end of beta. The queen fight has become less and less fun as time goes on, and I've only gone to a couple on my second character.
---
She doesn't drop loot you can't find just by doing AWOL Armaments, except the flux reward from beating the event (not from killing the queen, because sometimes you can fail the event and kill the queen after), takes hundreds of rounds of ammo, whatever aid you might need, and has a decent chance to bug out during or otherwise unable to be looted after. 
---
There's no real trick to the fight, it's just a matter of gunning down adds and plinking away at the queen.
---
Bethesda has shown us that they can put together fun events, or at least events that involve more steps than "fire until dry". The recent faschnacht event, One Violent Night, Signal Strength, or any of several other events have more involved steps than the end game fight, and that's weird. 
---
At the moment if I see a nuke drop on prime I might drop by and see if she's taking reasonable amounts of damage. If she's not, it's a waste of time for me to try to contribute to the event. 
---
Right now I have a better chance at flux and legendaries by dropping a nuke almost literally anywhere else on the map, especially a few popular locations. The fight is tedious and in my opinion the strongest indicator of how unfinished this game is, but she's not mentioned in the roadmap other than possibly a review of loot.
---
Not only fast travel easy to cheat but so is logging to get to camp ,unload junk , restock aid, and hop right back in . 
---
Nah
---
The whole game is just a virtual reality hallucination. So.. yes?
---
I don't think it will be multiplayer only. Everything in this game can be done solo. Don't think they'll fundamentally change that.
---
I was down for multiplayer fallout 5, but with NPC's. Now instead of creating a cool charisma build to play with my friends, they just don't play.
---
So let me get the tokens straight:
---
Say I have a 3* Bloodied SS with more damage the lower my health and two other effects. 
---
I can break that down and basically make the SS whatever I want with Tokens?
---
I could, say, use tokens to change the legendary effects? Maybe make one reduced weight?
---
I got a medic cryolater never seen one before,also got a vampire mg gone try it as 308 is easy to find.
---
Yeah I'm gonna try it..soon..but most likely with a team
---
To be fair, a lot of people -- a **lot** of people -- wanted a multiplayer Fallout. Few, I think, wanted what we got. There were legitimate complaints about the design and function of the game, beyond simply release-day woes. And while some of that has been addressed, with promising signals for Bethesda on the rest, people feel burned in a way with which it's hard to find fault. 
---
Then there are the others. I was talking '76 up with a friend who has been a die-hard Fallout fan for years, and all he could reply with was a "the game is shit" refrain, even though he's never played, and purportedly never will. That's an unreasonable stance. There are a ton of games out there that started off on the wrong foot, learned from their mistakes, and became blockbusters. 
---
No..I'm 500 hours in..I can't stand it
---
This seems apparent, so I figured you were being disingenuous.  
---
Doing an event or a nuke run or killing a legendary enemy gives players a chance to get good loot.  
---
Level 1, level 200, it doesn't matter.  As you point out, it's just # of people, points in luck and which event/ thing they're doing.  Ignoring that lower levels will have fewer points to have put into luck, let's say they're the same. 
---
For a single event, everyone can have pretty much the same number of chances because of this, as you say.
---
But you can do these things more than once.  Doing them gives you experience.  Experience gives you levels.  So, levels == experience == attempts at getting good gear.  higher level == more possible attempts to get good loot.  
---
Hopefully this makes sense to you.
---
STOP. BUILDING. THERE.
---
You're prevented from building there due to future content, not any present update. Pick somewhere else.
---
A day lockout for each spin at the slot machine doesnt sound so bad as long as we can lock in effects we like, even if it is on a tiered system such as, to reroll primary you reroll all three, to reroll secondary you keep primary and reroll secondary, and re rolling tertiary can be done individually
---
I agree with Raiders, took some time to get used to it.  After running a nuke zone for a while your be using diluted rad away and stims without really even paying attention.  Character makes sounds and you hear your heartbeat when you need to maintain.
---
I’ve recently noticed a few people mentioning luck perks has something to do with it and I’ve found myself wondering if it’s possible. I have a melee build with no luck, I’ve spent the last month farming legendaries in hordes, whitesprings, and random others. After a month, I have barely anything to show for it. What’s the deal?
---
Thanks for sharing your information :)
---
I think you can break down legendary weapons to get tokens and then use them to change effects on *other* weapons.
---
Barbarian also and lone wanderer with iron clad and full bos or marine then learn fix it good and keep armor over fixed if armor has vanguard or bolstering that helps too depends on play styles 
---
Yeah accessibility in this game is very lacking. It’s something I’ve seen a lot of games start doing with things like color blind modes, text to talk, enhanced fonts, etc. 
---
I think the reason Bethesda is behind the curve is because they retrofit old games, and in this case, retrofitted a game from 4 years ago when we didn’t have the great push towards accessibility that we have now. 
---
Do you have luck perks stacked by chance?
---
Obviously when the game tries to place your camp down, it can’t because of a conflict. You’ll have to move it.  Whilst you can, the game can’t. I’ve had this, find a new spot, sorry bud.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-tLYGkRlik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-tLYGkRlik)
---
That would make sense, too. 
---
Originally when I read it, I was like, "What? You can break down legendary weapons and get tokens to buy back that same weapon?" I knew I had something wrong lol
---
Op if you still got that far Gatling plasma would you sell it? 
---
I'm still looking for ants to complete that quest. LOL Tried going to the tea house, but that quest won't start up for me. :-\
---
Fallout 4 and Fallout 3 had awesome stories beginning to end. Five hours was def enough
---
I completed mine in a night, with no problem. 
---
You’re welcome. 
---
Btw I’ve only spent $5 in the atom shop. Everything else came from dailies and such that I happened to get without trying and the preorder bonus. I really wanted the moonshine mama mask. 
---
I don’t have time to intentionally grind away at collecting the materials to make 50 drinks. I want to play, not farm. I’m glad they have a way to get things for free. I’m also glad we can just buy them. Works for everyone.
---
Thanks for the link! I'll add this to my FO76 research. Funny enough, the day after I posted this, someone nuked the area where the Pumpkin House is. Tons of cobalt flux. There's a farm with lots of corn which turns to cobalt flux, for whatever reason.
---
As informative as that map is, its a little too clustered with info for me. Having to alt tab out of the game and select filters is also a little frustrating. 7 Days to Die map Menu was fantastic. Being able to make custom waypoints and share them would be nice to have in fo76.
---
You sound really pressed.
---
I would, if I weren’t on XB. I appreciate the offer.  
---
If you farm up the lead that’s a few thousand rounds!
---
WHAT'S THAT? I CAN'T HEAE YOU OVER THE #BOOM
---
Learnt the hard way if you mele kill them they explode but if you shoot the leg they don't,did this today twice today but as for the mele kill I thought they fixed it with the new patch and got a bit of a fright hehe.
---
I'll give 5k for it 
---
fermenters link directly to your stash box, you can take out something assigned to it when away from camp from any stash box.
---
Starting with what you're trying to attach to back to the connector that was making you jump works for me.
---
I have killed perhaps hundreds of people and have never been killed by reactive plates. I wonder why. I assume most people just don't use them. Emergency protocols is where it's at for bloodied builds. 
---
hunting rifles can 1-2 shot no mater the Dr or sent/ ass sent fyi
---
I might just be high but this feels like it should be a copypasta
---
I was matey. I was crazy enough to preorder the moment it was announced 🤣
---
I took notice of it today, it doesn't need a damage buff for me if I am using adrenal reaction, bloodied railway, and its ammo is only steel.
---
OK so I figured out why this is happening, if you move your camp node it changes your Spohn location and if it can’t Spohn you there it will tell you that your camp cannot be placed because of a fallout 76 update preventing it
---
Hi! I'm Cheez Wong and I approve this message. *double thumbs up sparkle smile*
---
How many tall men with the nuka girl suit are in game? I've seen one before.
---
Yeep
---
Would be cool if they “approved” our Camps to stay forever. Maybe there’s 1 of 5 players camps in the area that could randomly spawn. 
---
Whoops, how could I forget? Yes armor piercing is busted and doesn’t work for energy weapons. Before anyone chimes in with “uh actiallwy energy resists are lower!” no, they aren’t. I have the Awareness perk and when it comes to energy resists, I am Patrick Stewart. Because I’ve already seen everything.
---
Prime weapons are only useful for SBQ. Ammo costs too much to maintain if you are a casual non grinding scrub. Prime is a gimmick, just slightly better than scorched killer mods.
---
What would Guile do?
---
I think it has to do with where your camp node is on your "property". If you are placing near named locations move your camp node away from the location not towards it. I was having a similar problem the other day behind the whitespring, every time I got the notification you described it was because I had moved the camp node after placing my structures and then logging. I stopped moving the node and never had the problem again. Hope this helps.
---
I'm not sure if the Xbox firmware has been cracked. 
---
I know for a fact the way PlayStation works is that you have to have the latest firmware cracked to even use online with hacks. Past versions have been cracked but it's essentially useless. Tl;Dr can't hack on console.
---
The game can require a lot of free time to do anything worthwhile.  For me to make money i do one of 2 things. Collect the now zimbabwe dollar valued flora from an irradiated whitesprings also collect ghoul pinata parts  and while doing the loop i collect drugs. The other method is non radiated version...pick up everything and sell it in bulk. Then you sift through the pile of crap to see if you got any scraps worth keeping or storing for a rainy day.  Once that's all done you have to actually hop from place to place  I still check recipes as im playing an alt and need a few things. Every time i go to certain places i check certain areas for patterns/more drugs.  Once that shitty process is over i can finally do some quests if im not bored  from doing it every day.  The goal is to run out of building patterns so i can stop the cycle. 
---
yeah I have some friends that are really big into fallout that because this had such a rough along so they won't even give it a second look. I did get two of my friends to buy it when it went on sale for like $25 like 3 weeks after it came out so it's doable.I recently reinstalled the game and started playing and I'm pleasantly surprised with how well everything's been going
---
Sorry, those aren't even my weapons; I have them on loan...
---
Im well aware how they work
---
What u/BountyShizzle said. Laser weapons seem to be the most reliable with finding a fat stack for the plastic return. 
---
Is ironclad a good option the reason I ask is I'm not doing pvp but I'm running a sort of bloodied build with unyielding armor but them gutsy are going through me like butter.
---
It would be nice if we could tone down on the scorch beast sounds and the colors of there sonar attacks, they give me headaches because of this weird sensitive senses thing I have.
---
Hoarding items just for turn in currency is silly. Like I said they most defiantly will have a daily or weekly lockout. Your time would be better spend making alts to farm caps for now and get around the weekly lockout when he arrives. 
---
" Todd Howard's in-game character is "a giant man in a Nuka Girl suit". "
---
Is...is this for real? Lol
---
so as of now there are really no new quest?
---
Are you fast traveling a lot? That costs caps....
---
Yeah they really have beefed it up
---
I'm about to turn 40 which means I have about 35 years of experience playing video games. A person who is currently in their 20s is never going to understand what that is like. You will understand in the future though.
---
According to Todd, yes.
---
I personally would like to see mutations limited too. Like 1 per person. With a 2nd through serums. Would make them unique. And have uber powerful ones, example: lizard = scaly skin, healing factor, and gives night vision perk. Gives us something that large amounts of flux could be used for, and the unique ones could change player models? I dont know, spitballin
---
Wow all the hiccups and this is all the discuss? Seems like skeleton crew vaporware at this point. 
---
Only made it 17 mins in before I couldn't take the translator anymore
---
Lol that's pretty awesome.
---
You have no idea how old I am or how long I’ve played games. The fact you’re desperately trying to use your age as some sort of qualifier shows how truly childish you actually are.
---
Eh, it will probably have a lockout the same way vendors do with a max tokens you can earn per day on top of a max number of times you can use the vendor a day or a week. 
---
Wait, is this how we bypass the rule against memes? Just make photomode versions?
---
No, I've been going from my camp which is northeast of the map to vault 76 which is North of the lumber mill.
---
The people that wine about wanting human npc's piss me off because 76 focuses on environmental storytelling the only kinda story telling I can pick up on.
---

---
English one
---
If you are on PC ask the owner I'll pay whatever caps they want 
---
Did he give any insight of when the first survival season will start?
---
Did I say anywhere that this is *all* they discussed? They said a lot of things that are common knowledge to the players and are not considered "news".
---
&gt; Seems like skeleton crew vaporware at this point.
---
You said a lot of words, statistically, some of them should be good, but they weren't.
---
Also deep leather pockets. I haven't found them anywhere yet.
---
People are parsing the new cammo bundle but I feel like it needs to be addressed that we can't buy things on their own, I want to buy the hunting rifle cammo skin but I can only get it in the bundle costing me $34 NZD.
---
That's if you actually kill her. I've been there numerous times with numerous people and she always nust heals and runs away
---
Just added you? 
---
Doesnt really work for everyone. A lot of people quit thw game really quick
---
I wind up killing friends that aren't on the team in a nuke zone lol.
---
I hear the sounds while in the Expansion Plant area too. I just this place. It's like a sub level to Poseidon. It's mostly ghost town save for a few ghouls.
---
Ok that makes more sense when you word it that way but it still affirms that lv dosent matter just time played
---
Well, like you said, you can hack it’s just a ridiculous pain in the ass and takes a long time for people to breach. I worked for SCEA when SOCOM was breached. Took like six months before the hacks came out and even then you had to mod your system.
---
Good to know about recent systems though. I’ve run into several people on PC bragging about their aimbots. It’s depressing. They wipe everyone out in survival. It makes me physically ill these paid cheat sites are making thousands off ruining games.
---
I run w about 17 luck without drugs and can usually score like 5-6 one stars and a few 2-3 stars per whiterun circuit. I don’t have a low luck baseline, but it feels like legendaries spawn at a higher rate than when I had lower luck. 
---
I really like this write up , It follows my play experiance pretty spot on ...gonna copy pasta this next time I'm asked about the game .
---
Maybe it's a secret to be revealed in a future DLC!!!
---
Hahaha just kidding. I think it's just the ambient track
---
For the release that would be fine. At see how it’s performing afterwards. 
---
I do like to lock onto ppl and just run around them super fast tho
---
And I'm sure you're not aware that by placing it there, you keep the spawn point just beyond it from activating.  If you could move it to the NW corner of the intersection by the overseers camp, you'd get just as much traffic and you wouldn't block people from finding things like a crashed satellite, a dead civil war reenactor with plans to make civil war era clothes, an unexploded bomb, etc.
---
I agree make Friendship mode safer and Survival mode harsher.
---
Yes there is evidence of that. Occasionally I get slight pixelated vision on random occasion.
---
Very nice!
---
Um a bloody buzz blade with the right rolls is a terrifying weapon. 
---
Finally seasons! I said from the start they need a system like Diablo! Now we just need a hardcore mode aswell!
---
Pretty sure this is s design issue not necessary a bug, you move your camp and you pay, how will a ticket be useful in this case?
---
&gt;The Inside the Vault explicitly says 1400 caps, so all seven factions are meant. 
---
Good point.
---
And you’re not buying stuff, you’re not being killed a lot, don’t have a wanted status, right? Are you doing workshops? Those cost money to claim...
---
Burrrnnnnnnn
---
To be honest scout armor is probably the worst, I would say use it for pve but idk
---
Jumpin' Jive and Wishing on a Star were also in the BETA but mysteriously disappeared after
---
Why wasn't the quote from rat race just all star?
---
Not only that, anything on the group like purifiers and crops get deleted, this bug is still in the game.
---
Holy shit, I can run whitesprings all day and would consider myself lucky if I get a three star, I’m lucky if I get anything worth keeping after a couple hours. 
---
My old character had more luck but had a shitty build so I started over. I feel like I had better legendaries with that character for sure.
---
If you have friends to play with, this can be a fun Fallout game. As someone who doesn't know anyone who plays and has seen pretty much seen everything, there is absolutely nothing to do. For a MMO I really, really don't understand why there are no tools like global/local/trade chat built into the world. As a solo player, it's a dead world, and since they pretty much ignored all the easter eggs they put in the single player games there is nothing cool to search for and doing the same 'events' over and over is boring af.
---
So, for people having fun, great, but don't expect that just 'giving it a chance' would somehow spin people right around to your viewpoint. I've given it a chance, and I think I got my money out of it, but there is no way I'll play it for years after like I did with other releases unless they flesh a few things out a lot more.
---
This all sounds really cool. Along with April's patches this will make game play very interesting.
---
I'm  a slow player so it'll take me a while to experience all the new content. But that's a good thing. Means more game rime.
---
Working again on pc here since the last patch.
---
Me too. I'm fat &amp; my stash is full.
---
This makes me sad 😓
---
*takes off patrolman sunglasses*
---
MOTHER OF GOD...
---
No, if time played mattered and not level, that would mean you could AFK or do things that don't give you legendary loot and end up with legendary gear.
---
Since you can't, it doesn't.
---
Level is a reflection of what your maximum number of legendary rewarding activities is.
---
Time played isn't.
---
I have a 2* Unyielding Marine Chest. I believe the secondary is Rad resistance. Care to make an offer?
---
Damn alright. Thanks for putting this together though was very helpful!
---
I'm pretty upset about the noise that plays when you have a bounty everytime you use vats or go to the menu
---
or just make it not matter if you grief somebody camp and dont let "offline" progress carry over once the player comes back on
---
That could lead to unintentional duping if someone buys something from someone and offline progress leads to said item still being in the seller's inventory. 
---
I can't personally care about Survival until they get rid of the Top 3 player locations.
---
Are you doing vendor runs? Every day vendors get a max of 200 caps, shared within each faction. There are 7 different factions (for vendors) allowing up to 1400 caps per day. 
---
tukkunnizura 
---
Why cant it be simple like hand in x number of instigating weapons gets you 1 instigating token/mod that you can put on whatever weapon you want in the crafting workbench 
---
I think because it doesn't have legendary effects, it's not gonna be good for PvP. From everything I see, legendaries are what make something PvP viable. 
---
If you were my age you would understand and agree instead of saying nah. I am in no way desperate. I have more experience with video games than most people do. If you can't handle that fact then that's your problem.
---
Not to mention how loud and clunky it is. Almost everyone I kill in survival is in power armour hoping that their random tse rounds are gonna get me when I have dense fireproof 3 on. Like dude you aren't even sneaking I can just vats crit headshot you twice and your done
---
Thanks. I am definitely going to need to apply that rule as I've gone overboard and now will be spending a LONG time trying to offload it all.
---
And yes, it definitely is because I don't use it. I'm a terrible hoarder who likes having everything possible for the chance I may actually use it (I do not). I will say, I'm the polar opposite in real life though and don't hoard a thing haha. Maybe this game will help iron out some of my hoarding problems. :P
---
Thanks for the heads up on the other tips too.
---
&gt;CAMPS were originally not a part of the game
---
Fucking dodged a bullet there then
---
yea buying items should carry over, i meant when amother player decides to just break a bunch of walls
---
Not everyone has to like every game from the same series. These games play differently even when ignoring bugs. Some folks have different expectations, some games meet them, some don’t. Shouldn’t bother you at all that not everyone wants the same thing you do, enjoy the community you do have.
---
That player was a Legendary. 
---
Why not start your own?
---
I have scrapped close to 1000 pieces of leather armor and have yet to unlock the shadowed mod.....  
---
I don't know if more luck equals a better loot rate. I will try it tomorrow, starting at 6 luck and using chems and perks. Probably i'm going to OD before i get my foot out my CAMP.
---
I do enjoy his #SOOTHING.VOICE
---
As someone who’s spent hours upon hours of server hopping to find rare spawns, thank you.
---
The point is it is a flawed comparison to say 100 atoms=$1, therefore 1400 atom skin is $14 and that is outrageous. It excludes a relevant and crucial part of the analysis. 
---
It doesn't include rebate. free atoms in game = rebate, or discount. It adjusts the real world value of the Atom. It costs you $1 per 100 Atoms to supplement what you get. 
---
Lets look at it this way: I have 3910 Atoms right now. I have purchased a 700 atom pip boy skin, a 700 atom bed, and several 200-500 decorations. not sure exactly, but I have spent a minimum of 2500 Atoms probably more like 3K. That means the game has given me at least 6000 Atoms to be where I am at. This game has given me $60 to spend in the store. 
---
That is not insignificant...
---
I'm watching it right now, and what Todd said was that it COULD be split into seasons, that that was an idea they were tossing around.  Unless they say it definitively later on, he's just talking about *possibilities* for the future.
---
Ill give it another chance, but not at full price.
---
I think it should start at 50 and add 50 every hour your alive! 50-100-150-200 ect
---
Is it still possible? It seems like the loot is not respawning when I serverhop
---
I would like a "take a penny, leave a penny " scenario lol
---
Yes! I'm waiting for the day I log back in during my vendor run, accidentally pick survival and don't realise before I go to the Whitespring, get deleted and lose 5000 caps worth of junk
---
I noticed that too it could be a good chance to earn some caps risk free!
---
I'm online now, and probably will be all night tomorrow after 5
---
So someone just launched a nuke on the server I was on, and the dude managed to position the  ⭕️ so NEITHER Fissure Site was hit. WTF. 
---
Same! 
---
1:02:48 mark in the Twitch stream: Chris from BGS Austin: "There's lots of engineering challenges, um, you know it's, performance...." 
---
Todd Howard immediately cuts him off, "Going back to your question... uh" (pointing at the PR person)
---
Yeah...
---
After being kicked from 3 nuke zones in a single day i proceeded to nuke all the fo76 files from my pc.
---
Would be easier to join one that's already up and running, not many people I know on xbox play F76 :C
---
Yeah, it's not even a disability issue, it's just on obviously tiny text. I don't bother with a lot of it, it's just too damn small. 
---
I understand where you're coming from. My idea is similar to how things work now with PvP damage in adventure mode. There is none until you fight back.
---
Just last night I found a group of 150+ players screwing around. One had a bounty of 175 and his friends were there to defend him and get caps back when someone went for the bounty. I decided to play along. Until I attacked the wanted player no amount of bullets or whatever hurt me. They mini-nuked me even and not a bit of damage. 
---
If that sort of system could be used for offline player vending, great. But I did just find a flaw in my initial comment.
---
This could lead to abuse of the bounty system where a player can slap a base up, rack up a huge bounty, then exploit that with his friends to get more caps.
---
I definitely have noticed screws being used for everything I've done personally. I also have less of them than most other materials. I'll keep in mind the ballistic too.
---
I've yet to find any vendors aside from random bots (I think). Maybe they're Responders? But aside from that I'm in a bit of a predicament when trying to offload my excess junk and should probably rush to get as many vendors I can before I do anything else, this will help me keep a good balance.
---
Playing on Adventure. Thanks for the advice. :)
---
Probably because the system you are talking about would actually result in people having less of a chance at what they want then what we have been talking about. 
---
Can you imagine trying to get 10 trash 90% reduced weight item rolls to turn in for a guaranteed 90% weight reduction token. Your system is good for the base legendary effect but it sucks for the major 2* and minor 3* legendary effects because they drop much more infrequently no to mention if that was needed they would all go for insane prices in trade markets or people would just hoard them so it would take forever to even earn the weapon you wanted. 
---
I’ve have had this and OP’s problem happening to me. It’s frustrating that VATS is all over the place in this game. There will be times when VATS doesn’t work at all and dont land any 95% shots until I back out and retarget.
---
No lv is a reflection of experience earned thru events and quest and some do reward legendaries but not all havr or did. month one of this game is an example of this barely any legendaries aside from like 3 events which didnt happen that often. There is a bunch of players who reached level 80 to a hundred before they even found out about explosive weapons in the game I personally was if 120 before I stumbled into a nuked whitsprings at 4 in the morning in dec
---
I enjoy taking pictures of Pictures, the quest to find pictures of people alive before the bomb has been challenging. so far the best one ive found was of Rosalynn Jeffries
---
Oh wow I had no idea about this, thanks alot that'll definitely save me some time in the future 😀
---
It’s because of the way the formulas for damage vs armor works. Effectively, reducing target armor by 50% results in a 28% damage increase for all but extreme Value differences.
---
At half health? No advantage to using AA. But you have to be at half health. It’s a trade off. 
---
The number of folks wanting/trying to sell AA melee weapons (especially big 2h weapons that actually might reach the extremes with Incisor where they effectively ignore armor entirely) is insane, since with Incisor, AA is like a 12.5% armor reduction... which is like an 7% damage increase. Suuuch a waste. 
---
A hazmat suit works well for gathering water too. Less cumbersome.
---
As a WestTek dish dweller for months now I couldn't disagree more. 
---
I don't have turrets I just have a sweet shooting gallery platform to pop mutants in my spare time. 
---
Beth - keep the Dish dream alive ;)
---
(•_•) So you took.  ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■  The nuclear option? (⌐■_■)
---
Hardcore survival where the ranking is by level would be cool
---
At workshops you can scrap some environment. Nothing at the camp though.
---
Also gotta love the irony of calling someone childish when all you can say is "nah" repeatedly.
---
Indeed, it's not the actual number of attempts.  It's the maximum possible number of attempts.  
---
Just asking. See too many joining and not enough making ones.  But I see your point. 
---
Very good, and I hope Bethesda listens.  I do love PVP servers but I don't enjoy one shots.  I don't like being killed that way and I don't like killing that way.  I like a good fight.  I have no interest in this survival mode unless some major changes are made.
---
If I was doing it and I didn't mind dying, I'd server hop for the Uranium Fever event and farm West Tek. 
---
Damn that's frustrating as all hell, my biggest problem with vats has been with melee, sometimes even if the enemy is in my face punching me and I have 95% *amd* I'm marching the attack button as hard as I can. My guy  just sits there getting attacked.
---
can I get a link? Not even sure what VOD means but I do have twitch; just not sure how I'd find the broadcast on there, cheers
---
No, that isn't why that happens. It happens because his camp spot is in conflicted with new unreleased content.
---
I wanna be able to take on a scorch beast queen with a squad and trade items and such. 
---
Most likely, they would probably be same servers since pc is grouped together
---
Set up water purifiers at your camp. Farm purified water. Sell purified water to vendors. Spread caps out on floor and roll around on them (optional).
---
Knocking on locked doors yes!  
---
Best and fastest way imo is team with someone level 70 or above and tag enemies. Can easily get 10 levels in a weekend with xp boosters and inspirational shared. Event hopping is good and nuke zones if you have a hazmat suit.
---
Damn, so hyped about BL3 I forgot about anything Bethesda might have had to say! Missed out on it
---
I feel ya. I’m looking for that my self. 
---
I just got on today to see the code. I don't dupe any items or have any duped Items. Idk what else would cause me to get banned, I haven't played the game in ~5 days. What do I do?
---
Will I be able to add them to my friends list?
---
You on xbox? 
---
Sorry, by "3 robots" I just meant Flatwoods, Sutton, and just recently the Morgantown Airport. I'm guessing they all are Responders?
---
I also forgot to mention, I've actually done a quest that made me pass out and I happened to meet that Lemonade Stand robot, I even trigger the fast travel location right next to him! So that's at least another store to help me offload junk.
---
I'll have to quickly go around and find all these other vendors to help me offload my junk. Thanks!
---
I am. 
---
I just want some different skins for the garage door other than warehouse.
---
Man you make me feel really bad for the junk that I call a camp, congrats!
---
I was not aware but not surprised at this terrible implementation.  Do you know how far from that spawn your CAMP needs to be to keep it active? I don't mind moving but I did actually try placing where I think you are suggesting and it was not very friendly to putting down the CAMP or my actual build.   So broken...
---
We should make our own discord, with Black Jack! And hookers! 
---
Meh
---
The boring part is when you are out of ammo/adhesive and you just have to use random weapons you find that your character doesn't use effectively and you might not personally like
---
DUDE!  I was day 1 DCUO 1/11/11
---
I loved that game but it was, as you say, 3+ years to get it solid. The disconnects causing Raid wipes early on were truly dark days
---
Doorbell plans. Lol
---
1, 2, 3, and 4 will make this game so much more awesome.
---
Your one after my own heart. Bender is the truth. 
---
You mentioned "filling other characters with bulked junk". How did you do that? Like can you make character mules in this game?
---
Player vending machines sounds pretty nifty too!
---
Ok.
---
Guess I'll need to find one.
---
Interesting. I've been [tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit?usp=sharing) all my loot drops on a fresh character for weeks now and there is a pattern emerging for me.
---
* Half of my 2\* enemies drop 2\* loot and a third of the 3\* enemies drop 3\* loot. 83% of my loot is 1\*.
---
* Killing a legendary at night increases the chance of a Nocturnal drop.
---
* Keeping legendary items in your inventory increases the chance of getting more of that legendary effect or item type. The number of items does seem to matter in case you stash multiple items with the same effects.
---
* Stashing a legendary ranged weapon with an effect also available for armor and melee (Hunter's, Exterminator's) increases the chances for those item types as well, and vice versa.
---
* Whitesprings, Watoga and Harper's Ferry has the highest chance for a 3\* drop. West Tek often has no legendaries and AWOL is pretty rare with 1-3 legendary enemies (the more participants the more likely there will be more)
---
* There is a possibility for complementary streaks. For example, getting the same effect in a quick succession on different weapons or armor types.
---
VOD = Video On Demand
---
Honestly it’s a good gimmick for this game, because experience is actually useful beyond just getting better guns
---
I dropped mine. Woulda gave you it all if i knew someone wanted it. I had 86. But its gone now. Game pissed me off.
---
We should be charging about the waste land having mutants bite our shiny metal asses.
---
In survival with the 20% extra, 5% from sleeping and 5% from cranberry cobbler you get 30% extra xp. I went from rank 4 to 22 in one day on my new character.
---
And in 4 psycho and I think jet had some to and 76 is on the same game  engine or whatever its called
---
yeah I think without camps, this game would've been dead before they had a chance to fix the bugs.
---
I know, I'm trying to build the excavator and it really pisses me off I dont have any now
---
Anyone have any advice being successful in survival PvP with a super sledge after the latest patch? I could use some advice please.
---
I used to one shot sentinal/assain builds with a crit. It seems i no longer can. This puts me at a disadvantage. Standing still trying to finish off a sentinal with basic sledge attacks is kind of impossible. I need a crit to take them down to lower life, then another hit to stagger and a third to finish the job. Most players can pop me a few times with ANY weapon while i swing away.
---
Running cavaliers i have little resists while im standing still and attacking.
---
Kind of bummed im not relevant 1v1. My role is now being a distraction for snipers..
---
Super sledges are in a bad place now. The latest patch put ranged sentinals even further ahead of the pack. I may be being a bit defeatest but do super sledge builds even work in survival mode?
---
A vats crit should be killing these guys. My base dmg is 1300. I use better crits. But it isnt getting the job done.
---
Running 5cavs/(unyielding/assasin mix) 3 star SS with swing speed.
---
Definitely no cheats or hacks here. Just good old-fashioned down-home molestation. Cheating to gain superiority is effectively advertising inferiority. It's also lame. 
---
Or the bounty sound everytime you exit a menu 
---
Let's hope so. I'll keep an eye out to see if anything pops up there over the next few months.
---
prob going to take like 15 legendaries just to change one.
---
I mean every other game has it why not us. Doesn’t have to be insane boosts but enough warrant. 
---
Like 20% would be nice
---
Well leave your gt and ill see if i have any on my other character. Xbox?
---
What does someone else quitting the game have to do with some people not having the time to grind for free atoms? 
---
Sorry my $5 made you salty. 
---
Hacking is the sole reason I do not want crossplay tbh.
---
Sadly no, I'm on PS4
---
To the edge of the universe!
---
I really do wonder why the max level for all types of enemies is not 50 or higher. Molerats and radstags I can understand, but why do Mole miners and wendigo's fal shrot of the max level drop threshold? 
---
dang
---
My vision is decent and I still cant read many of the notes. I mostly gave up reading them, I just collect them. Its really quite sad. Since release I wish I could read the text in normal and bigger letters.
---
I have been attacked more after the PVP server started than before.  It's the only place a pvp spec player can grief a PVE spec player with little to no risk.  I'm sorry, "roleplay" a raider. 
---
Thanks for the offer tho
---
YES! 
---
Awww. Ok well. At least i tried haha
---
Kinda wondering if the script to choose random nukashine blackout spawn points running simultaneously on a dozen people like that wasn't actually what caused the server hiccup. 
---
Haha yeah my camp was set up as fast as possible to quickly utilize what I needed at the moment.  I’ve had other players just stare at it for awhile in awe of how absolutely shitty it is.
---
Survival scares me. I’m not a fan of being randomly picked off “just cuz”.
---
Pretty sure this is the actual reason now that I think back on what I've changed when it gets binned.
---
&gt;Survival Mode will add a Season mode that will require news character every season. (Nothing concrete yet but they are working on something like this) 
---
This s#cks. I mean I would go then play in Adventure Mode and attack players and get attacked by players there, but there attacking other players has no longer impact as you can't damage players at all. So when it comes to F76 my options are now either play PVE only or play PVP where my character gets wiped every new season, what s#cks.
---
I’d say 15% base with at least 20-25% while teaming. Regardless of the number of players on team. 
---
I shoot full auto into the ground 
---
xD Ty! And don't worry, at start it was the same for me! I still have a pic of me in front of my first "house", and when it appear on loading i laugh xD
---
Agree. The thing is nothing about the cosmetics is it has, essentially, nothing to do with the game. Only ones ego and vanity.
---
I won't say things are "over priced" … someone buys them so it is more 'too rich for my blood'. I just personally don't see the value in $10 armor paint. 
---
I did save my Atoms and got the new brown pack for Atoms earned. There is a certain satisfaction in having 'earned it'
---
I really hope the Legendary Vendor allows us to in some manner work towards the optimal three  Legendary Effects we desire on anything so we have something to use all these useless Legendaries on.
---
Also the issue that there still are so many useless Legendaries.
---
Expect ding dong ditch, but without the flaming bag of poo. Just a regular bag. 
---
Does reading frustrate and disappoint you? Do you require comprehension assistance? Hooked on phonics is here to help! [https://www.hookedonphonics.com/](https://www.hookedonphonics.com/)
---
Going to be a long time at the rate right now. Have had numerous emails back and forth with them and it’s all the same. This is most definitely a punishment of sorts so I would expect this to last a lot longer. 
---
He doesn't sell for caps .)) I have it for indefinite period basically and seeing as it is literally the most powerful heavy weapon in game, I would never trade nor sell it...
---
Plastic is everywhere though.
---
Probably. I worry we will have to download the game again as a Steam version. 
---
Well you can spend 2-3 hours at whitesprings and you'll reach level 50. 
---
Not a big deal.
---
Clearly not from WV or very young.
---
Sounds my speed.  What time zone?  I play sometimes morning/afternoons and after dinner. Hardly ever on late.  I'm eastern time.  What is name of discord community? 
---
Of course everyone prefers bullet time. A shame it's literally impossible in 76.
---
He is mentioned at Uncanny Caverns but they changed his name.
---
Gears and Screws I'll definitely keep in mind. They're some of my least common finds too. And I notice I've needed screws for a lot of things. Not seen black titanium so I'll keep it in mind.
---
Right now I've got 2500 Steel which is probably overboard haha. I was thinking of making throwing knives with the excess steel for XP and using them as weapons too. Can I sell them? Because that'd be even greater. Wood is sitting about 1000, which is pretty big as well.
---
For ammo, right now I'm melee, but I've been thinking about using Big Guns as an alternate/secondary main. I've yet to encounter Big Guns though at all or ammo for them, so I'm not sure on how to encounter ammo yet.
---
I definitely need to ditch the drugs too. I've been keeping them all and have never used them in any Fallouts, apart from very rare emergencies, but even then I usually don't use them. As for food and water, they definitely add up and I have found it to be very common. I've yet to struggle on that element and actually tend to have excess.
---
I've definitely been scrapping junk! Whilst exploring every area, I get over-encumbered so much, when I found a work bench I instantly head for it to scrap, really takes a load off!
---
You could build one with a powered speaker and a switch! Sadly, I don't think there's a way to make it do the iconic "ding-dong" noise, and I also don't think there's any way to set the maximum amount of time that the speaker plays... so unless the person turns the switch off again, you'll just get a terrible, continuous droning noise. 
---
Yes, need plastic ta shoot muh shotguns
---
+Everything I kill lowers carbon footprint
---
Having to grind in a game for currency in a game you paid for isnt any kind of gameplay only a select few want, and im sorry im jot really salty at your 5 bucks everyone spends money on mtx. But having to grind in a game you paid for is no kind of gameplay experiance anyone wants except you i guess?
---
I’m down for a discord group. 
---
I'm very happy to hear vault raids are instanced. Hopefully there's some kinda queue system in place for it.
---
Lol ok.
---
&gt; The limited window for these paints is also disappointing. This applies pressure to the customer to spend today
---
Welcome to the world of marketing.
---
Businesses don't exist to make great games. They exist to make money.
---
Oh shit, I can’t wait for nuclear winter. Plenty of people are in need of prestige.
---
You know anyone else that would join it? 
---
You don't use shotguns do you?
---
Nope I’m a loser. 
---
The season mode for survivial sounds awesome and much needed.
---
That's given me an idea... 
---
careful making them mad, i got a suspension because i called a dude out for running away from a fight in a different game and got suspended.
---
I'm not really sure.  Across the road might work, further down might work.  If you have an alternate account, you can try to test it by placing your camp and then server hopping.  
---
To get the spawn, when you materialize at the overseer's camp, you are west of the camp facing the covered bridge.  Turn left and head toward the red truck.  Pass the truck on the right, go over the gravel pit (resource) and you'll see a small clearing just beyond.  20% of the time the clearing is empty, but the rest of the time there is something interesting there.  If you place your camp, hop worlds (by joining a friend that is on a different world) and there is something in the clearing (look for a tent, bomb, suitcase, body, grave, bloatflies, vertibot, protections, scorched, lemonade stand, etc, then you are far enough away.  
---
I do not. Shells? Yeah I guess I see your problem.
---
I was so excited for you and then just a gal aww. If does sum up the game 
---
Would really hope you're correct in assuming you can reroll individual effects at higher cost. The last thing I need on my RNG loot drops is more RNG on my loot drops.
---
I'd buy em all if it was a 2000 pack
---
Thank you for the heads up on those. 100 definitely seems to be a wise and common number for most. And I've seen a few suggestions on screws and springs, which I've noticed I have less of. And Plastic will be great as I'll need to bulk a tonne of junk to sell it.
---
So far I've met a robot in Flatwoods, Sutton, and Morgantown Airport. I also met a Handy at a Lemonade stand due to a quest where I blacked out, which I've got fast travel right next to him which will be handy.
---
Thanks for the other robot details. I'm still new and don't know the names of these places, but I think rushing toward these vendors will save me a world of future pain. I've already got a lot to offload and I also don't use drugs aside from the ones you mentioned, which means more to sell haha.
---
Oh?
---
I laugh at morons who actually put f76 next to Anthem, like bruh, F76 is a functional game with rewarding elements at least.
---
They stated in the March 13 patch notes that that is eactly why this will be happening.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0mjux/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_notes_march_13/
---
Look at the camp placement section
---
I hope it will support cross-play
---
Yeah you're truely arguing like an adult, aren't you.
---
Just slid into yo DMs
---
Lame :/
---
It says this at mine outside of whitespring station, tested many times. It says there’s a future update but allows me to replace it, log in, log out. Still there, move my node and nope
---
Boiling water 
---
Todd said it's for 4 players. The roadmap calls them raids as well.
---
But his job isn’t just to hype a product - it’s to represent the Bethesda brand. He also doesn’t need to reply to every criticism or negative response, but he very easily could’ve made a quick video or statement thanking players for their patience and promising to improve. Had he done that I would have no problem, and would’ve taken nothing away from their efforts fixing the issues
---
Literally my favourite part of the game. When you think about it, having literally no "home" would make gameplay a fair deal harder, having to travel around to different stations for the right crafting benches for example 🙄
---
I made one for an earlier camp using a pressure plate and a powered speaker.  It went beep when someone stepped on the plate.  Then I used the small letter set to put the word DOORBELL on the wall just above the plate.
---
I saw him once, he gave me a copy of Skyrim for pip-boy. I tried to load it on my pip-boy and all it did was try to auto-buy Skyrim in Steam but I already have it.
---
Anyone got a video link?
---
I'll add you when I get home I always end up with legendary pistols but I don't use them 
---
Doing it solo like pro for about 10hours. Server hoping not work because there aro not egouth people, events dont start as much as needed. Mostly meeting legendaries without star that dont count. Need one fucking more wish me luck.
---
In group you have like no chance, there are not egouth legendaries in game, bethesda dont have fucking idea about their game. Gonna make another shitpost as i finish this garbage because i am pissed of like fucking capibara with stick in ass.
---
Have fun man, just dont do this nightmare
---
So I have been hording 3* items that don't weigh that much. My idea is that when the legendary vendor shows up, the 3* will matter, so hopefully I can get better trades. I used to just sell it all. Hopefully this pays off. Until we know the exact system the purveyor uses it's just a guess. 
---
Do what you want to do. Some pvp data says that pvp is so unlike pve that armor doesn't matter much. You will die from 2-3 shots no matter what, unless you have a sentinel assassin set.
---
Wouldn’t surprise me
---
Never claimed I was. That’s just another assumption you’ve made. You seem real fond of those.
---
Oh God, I just thought of something stupid... Earn a small bounty in Adventure mode, swap to Survival, and see how well you can do before you die. That can't work, can it? Wanted status has to be separate in both modes, right?
---
&gt;  Aiming still sucks in this engine though
---
Why is that? I've been playing pretty much just FPS games my entire life but suddenly in FO4 and 76 I feel like I'm brand new to iron sight mechanics.
---
do the trashbins reset? As I've found tons of ammo in them before.
---
What's up me?
---
Grafton.
---
The plan is called lever gun.  Kinda misleading but either vendor should have it since it's now a static item for their inventory. 
---
Fair enough. Tbf I’m not planning on jumping into the PvP mode yet. I’m not a big fan on what’s been done with it and want to see what gets changed. 
---
"Take a Legendary, leave a Legendary"
---
I would love to back that claim up, but the whole ban thing, bit the punishment, but the way it was handled given the release state of the game changed my mind about this portion of bethesda studios
---
use the siren.
---
There won't be a season mode for quite some time.
---
Same for me, specifically at whitespring. I haven't encountered it anywhere else.
---
My experience does not line up with yours. Every time I see someone nuke Fissure Prime, most of the server still goes to fight her. Her drops are *alright*, not great but I usually get some prime plans that are valuable.
---
I wear tuxedo for armor and use pistols. too many people trying to hard to win, I'm over here trying to survive.. with style.
---
I imagine it will be like SBQ. You can go alone, but good luck.
---
Can I say something on the other side, though?
---
I already know that multiplayer Fallout isn't my game.  When I purchase a game like COD, GTA or RDR, I go right to the campaign mode, and never give the multiplayer component a first, let alone second, look.
---
Given what I know about F76, the thing that I know first and foremost is that it caters to a style of play that I do not and will not enjoy.  I am not a social gamer.
---
So while I can certainly appreciate how fed up you must be with people who denounce this game without playing it... trust me when I say that I'm equally tired of people browbeating **me** to "give this game a chance!" when I already know that its core components aren't elements that I personally enjoy.
---
This is why there's 31 flavors at the Baskin.
---
I tend to do it when people are around, hoping they find it.
---
I also dump stuff in the Overseer's cache in Flatwoods
---
Did they say something about a container to transfer items between alts? Like in Borderlands 2 for example
---
Like a microphone?
---
CAMPs are one of the more popular things in the game. Expect more features and additions to the CAMP system.
---
But...you have the option to not grind
---
I've been scrapping 90% of weapons I find so far and have noticed a lot of mods have been unlocking. I was used to Fallout 4, where you can make a standard cheap part and take that new mod to keep, but I noticed this game overwrites them if you do that (I lost a decent upgrade by testing this haha) and that you now get random mods from weapons instead of what they have is interesting.
---
Thank you for mentioning specific items! With time I'm sure I'll get more used to it, but right now I don't know what items give, so knowing those items are very useful as I find I have less of them too. The chems you mentioned are all I use too, so I'll need to offload the rest before I end up stocking too many.
---
Good to know the less used junk too. I'll for sure keep them in mind so I know what to offload first. And thank you for sharing the adhesive! It's one of my lower quantity materials I have, I'll just have to find the vegetable starch recipe.
---
I don't understand the Power Armor frames things yet as I've not really encountered them. But I'm sure in time I'll understand this more, thanks for all the great tips. They're super handy for me. :)
---
I can't count how many times I've stumbled upon paper bags, only to have it infinitely loading
---
This is the reason. I had the same issue and it was from moving the camp after it's placed into a red zone. It will move fine but you'll get the notice it's not valid on the next log.
---
I'd love to know this too
---
The basic wood windows you start with have shutters that close. The metal and brick sets you have to buy just have always open... I want to be able to close them. 
---
But it is in every fallout game because that's when the bombs dropped. That's why you find halloween decorations in every single fallout game, that's the time of year that society was halted.
---
Not sure if serious...
---
But we can't have different opinions 😉
---
I like it. I want to rebuild my CAMP because I'm getting bored of my hotel. I want to turn it into a bar with a room in the back. It feels so bad tearing it all down though.
---
Grafton station. 
---
What's your psn handle?
---
The invulnerabulity doesn't on most of the fast travel locations
---
Steam integration is possible, but most likely it will use the Bethesda account and Bethesda friends list. It is possible to do both, which is what War Thunder does, but I found it confusing as I somehow have two War Thunder accounts.
---
Damn, rip
---
Its xxfAtMaN654xx, really dumb but its that
---
I play fallout to be alone. If this game was playable offline maybe I'd play it. It just looks like an amateur fo4 mod without anything I enjoy about the fallout series.
---
Haha okay. So you're just here to troll then. Don't waste my time please.
---
Well they’ve already updated the menu screen for the Wild Appalachia update, so I think expecting them to update it for future major content updates is pretty reasonable.
---
Arktos is the red and black  building in the most recent load screens.  I was wondering why it was there...  I knew why Helvetia was being shown, and Frat Row, and the picture of the upgraded Camp ... but Arktos was out of place.
---
I appreciate that thanks dude I've been playing fallout my whole life I didn't expect to get banned for carrying so many items but I hope they fix it soon dude because I'm missing out and I've done so much on my account 
---
Okay, I'll look for you
---
Hopefully you at least don't pop the 3* that spawns until whoever spawned that 3* gets a chance to kill it.
---
This is my biggest gripe with turret bases at the Whitespring........those ghouls that you're shredding with your turrets would not have spawned if it were not for me spawning them. You're stealing my spawns so at least have the decency to let me get my legendaries.
---
As a none headphone user can I request the same? I don’t need multiple heart attacks this young...
---
So your saying a if 200 can attempt an event more often than a if 50
---
Why should a low level get the same as a higher level? We put in the time so should you. Keep grinding 
---
Yeah, the super sledge from 76, *the version from that game*. You gonna freak out when someone's vault suit cosplay doesn't have a 13 on it?
---
No, I just got off to take a break, I got pissed, I'll be back on in a bit 
---
I donated both an instigation lever action and an instigating fire axe that were lvl 25 to a lvl 24 player I randomly met.
---
Maybe you just need someone to play with. What system?
---
Too late for that. Have a good one! 
---
That is great to hear. I like being able to mix it up.
---
Two Shit Explosive Rolling Pin? We have a deal! *deposits level 10 exterminator pistol
---
The. Adrenal syringe gun helps a lot too 
---
to the top
---
I wanted a game with optional co op that still had a plot with permanence, like how destroying megaton is permanent. Doing the same events and missions over and over without end is not fun to me.
---
I'm encouraging you to do it, because before building this C.A.M.P. it felt really difficult to tear it all down. But then, I was even prouder of my work, I love this C.A.M.P. even more than the previous one, and I'm sure you'll do as well. Because I'm sure you'll find ways to be satisfied, even it takes a long time to get there ! Thanks for you feedback, I've enjoyed reading you.
---
I just go farm Mole Men when I need shells. Uranium Fever is a GREAT event for that. Also Welch is another reliable place to farm shells.
---
I literally gave my buddy 600+ shells the other night after doing that event (I don't use shotguns)
---
it's fair that you want to spend your money how you want to spend your money but that all sounds pretty judgemental. I cannot comprehend why people look down on people for spending their money in a way that makes them happy and literally has no bearing on anything else...
---
how is someone earning them any less bc they used money to buy some? im just curious because...you can earn them all by playing the game and still want more atoms and buy some.
---
that doesn't mean you didn't earn atoms. and even if someone chooses to not do the challenges and instead buy atoms they still ...earn them. they work a job that buys those atoms, right? how are they not earning it?
---
as far as buying different options to design a house...isn't necessarily about ego and vanity. you get bored looking at cabin shack walls all the time and want a change. it means a broader choice of floors to make things look different. that's not really a negative, is it?
---
I find things over priced because in other games I can buy more content for less money. take a sandbox build game like Conan exiles. for a $10 DLC pack there is a new set of foundations, walls, roofs, ceilings, fences, triangle parts and all matching accessories, craftable armors for light, medium and heavy, craftable weapons, craftable decor and pet armor even in some cases. I'm leaving a lot off the list for brevity sake but my point is if I compare a game I buy with no sub and then buy content to augment the visuals ... fo76 is over priced. 
---
can I earn a tiny amount of atoms in fallout? yes. does it cover what I want to buy? not even close. would I buy much more even with real money if it was priced like things in Conan are? absolutely without question.
---
cool beans.
---
Bad news and good news. This sounds like a bug, but the good news is it's easy to get black titanium. The mole people drop very common scrap that gives black titanium.
---
Could be you join a queue, maybe single or as a team of 2 or three, and get a random added who was also looking to do that instance.  Some other games do that.
---
The server hopping crushed you.  You need to join a server, do one lap to all the spots and tally how many legendary enemies you came across, preferably noting exactly where.  Do that a few times, each on different servers, to get an idea of what an average amount per lap is.  Once you know the average amount of legendary enemies, you keep jumping servers doing 1 lap on each server until you do a lap and get a number that exceeds the average by a decent bit (if 10 is average, 20 would be a good bit).  Then, if you stay on that server, every lap you do where the enemies have respawns should spawn the same exact legendary enemies in the same spots.
---
Was having same problem =|. If you're up high trying to connect something down low it won't do it. Had to go ground level sometimes to get it to work. The campfire trick is gone too.
---
Actually surprised that doesn’t exist
---
Yea, I know that, I'm also level 17 and have shitty guns, and they move in packs, so thatd be alot slower than buying one of those maps
---
That's exactly what I wanted to know! Glad I can have both melee styles and a firearm option. It's nice to know you can at least go the extra mile for something that doesn't match completely too.
---
Its posted on YouTube.  Via Bethesda's channel
---
Shit son, this sounds awesome
---
Saw a lvl 58 3* brainbot in the cranberry big last night.  Got excited and forgot about the robot part.
---
Boom. 
---
Honestly, that's a big ask, when you're taking about a wold that has new players along with old ones...anything you change in the world would be sen by a new player, which breaks...everything.
---
Some games do this with phasing (WoW is a prime example), but that introduces a lot of complications, and takes a pretty high level of game development that I don't believe the current developer has the experience or the bandwidth to accomplish.
---
I wonder if the vault raids can be done with just one person or you have to have four to enter.
---
 I prefer to go solo on everything.
---
That's awesome. With so many options I'm just ogling at what to try first haha.
---
Cardi B did it again. Damn.
---
Man white springs golf course ghouls drop 2 or three caps each. Plus the xp if ya have the weapons to take them down fast. Something that does over 100 damage takes a couple hits usually. That and they drop decent junk. 
---
Dang it I just read the post and assumed this stuff *was* coming. I guess I gotta watch the video.
---
And dances. 
---
Honestly, stay in your level zone and do this-  
---
Well rested, cranberry beverages and cobbler, leader bobbleheads and If your bold survival mode.  
---
Trying to kill higher level enemies provides diminished returns in my opinion. It takes you longer, you frequently have to fall back and requires greater resources.  
---
It’s boring, but repeatedly hopping static supermutant spawns in the forest first, then the toxic valley, then the ash heap, then the divide and the mire and wrapping it up in the bog will get you to 50 quickly and provides currency and ammo/grenades that will help you clear them faster.
---
Sweet
---
I’m on PS4 and I’d appreciate it. I’m out of town until Monday. BrotherxSpartan 
---
Just get a high level friend and launch a nuke at white springs,  then farm ghouls
---
that's just a building feature. +
---
Great idea
---
You're losing caps, they're just vanishing? That's a new one, I've not heard of anybody just losing caps at random. You can only lose caps through fast travel, buying stuff from a vendor, claiming a workshop, moving your CAMP, or dying while you have a bounty.
---
What's yours for when I get back on?
---
Awesome! Great job. I would add some plants :) 
---
I get it's a beta test so of course there will be issues. Just don't want to miss out on the weekly.
---
Thanks for the warning. I'll probably work on Heavy Weapons if I were to choose a gun type this time around.
---
But I drool at the thought of all the weapons really haha.
---
Inspect it in inventory 
---
Ps4 sorry I'll be launching again tmr
---
When I died I felt triumphant 
---
Don’t think ure inspecting said piece properly. Look at the piece in your menu if it showing 2 or more stars you can inspect it further to see all full perks that is on it. 
---
You have to "inspect" items to see the other effects. The option is in the pipboy when you select the item
---
They also haven't shut down the idea of it, despite all the rumours. And that seems like a bad idea, letting people keep getting hyped over the possibility only to ultimately not do it when they could just tell us straight out "no that isn't happening. Sorry."
---
Sure that would be upsetting, but it's better to let us know now than to find out on our own when the time comes.
---
I’m on Xbox but ty. I look on the bazaar for a suitable weapon daily but never see anything. I have plenty of caps just waiting to see someone actually selling a weapon I want.
---
As for the alt, yeah I’m still on the fence. Part of me is coming around on the idea of efficient and quick leveling.
---
OK, I see where you are coming from.
---
I think you mean several thousand lol
---
I love how red dead did notes and Arthur’s journal. You could see the handwritten note and how it looked, but to make it easier to read, you could hit a button and it gave it to you in plain text. I have perfect vision, but the notes in fallout are on dirty, grimey paper with black ink (which is aesthetically pleasing for an apocalypse game) and difficult to read. 
---
After this panel there will be 175426.
---
I didn't say I wanted the same Item I just wanted to get at least something instead of just items I cant even junk
---
I have 3/3 CF.
---
Whats that?
---
I'm glad this is possible! It's nice knowing you don't have to min-max to have a good time or if it's a necessity to progress. Like games where the "end-game" is basically a meta-only/min-max build that you follow has always been stale and un-fun for me. 
---
Like to me it's almost like everyone is just doing a job at that point, working for efficiency and not fun. But that's me, I'm sure others have fun with it. I love variety and mixing it up, changing what I do and can do to keep it interesting for me.
---
Also try r/fo76FilthyCasuals 
---
I'm on PC or I would!
---
Would have added value to claiming workshops though, and I hope they rework those so people have some real incentive.
---
Grafton, and a few other spots like Harper's ferry I think, Welch. Not exactly sure I always go to grafton
---
I can't confirm if it applies to anything else. The only one I know of for sure is the blue suitcases. Apparently these go back to Fallout 4 where they had the same behavior.
---
What I *can confirm* is other containers can reset *while you're looting them* (like the lunchbox in Watoga Station next to the blue suitcase). I've seen tons of plans dumped in them, and between the time it took me for to see what was inside and open up the loot screen the items reset, causing everything inside to be lost.
---
I don't know if anybody's really done extensive testing on this. Dump items at your own risk.
---
He got my upvote, the game *is* pretty crappy.
---
I agree. I don’t have time to restart characters. 
---
That is nice to know. For now melee has been carrying me and we'll see what weapons I end up stumbling upon.
---
Thanks for the warning as well, I'll keep that in mind. 
---
LGR is probably in your subscriptions list, he is on mine, love his channel.
---
I agree ! Because plants are great and they add to the atmosphere. But it’s often difficult to find where to put them, since their branches can go through walls. Nevertheless I’ll see if I can add some plants ! Thanks for the suggestion !
---
100% This. I get huge stockpiles of oil just casually going from location to location and have absolutely nothing to use it on. Just bulking and selling it to vendors. I use tons of plastic crafting plasma ammo, and 2000 cartridges goes away fast. 
---
Thanks turns out I do have 3 stars ! Lmfao
---
Thanks for the help, gonna delete the post now lmfao
---
Thanks I appreciate it !
---
In your CAMP small rocks, trees, bushes, and grass will be auto-removed if you build on top of them. In workshops certain items can be scrapped, but it seems random. Sometimes I'll be able to scrap one shelf but not another one near it. Sometimes I'll get the green outline showing that I can scrap something, but I can't.
---
You know where I can buy them?
---
This Lone Wanderer is gonna peak his head inside and see how far he can get.  It would be \*GREAT* if the instance could sense the # of players in the group and auto-tune difficulty accordingly.
---
But this is Bugthesda we're talking about here and I don't think their junior programming team is up to the challenge.
---
That is exactly what I wanted to do as a setup so that is awesome! Sounds like Strength is going to be ideal for me too, as I'll have an easier time with having more options.
---
HW&amp;Explosives sound real fun to pair together too. 
---
That's what I'm saying, go to grafton train station and they should be selling them their
---
That’s what it’s all about having fun lol
---
Yes everyone is obsessed with damage builds but that’s why everyone is a bloody build and not unique 
---
LOL me too about 750h, I hate every second, it is self harming by proxy but doesn't require blades, closures and iodine.
---
I also eat my least favourite foods and drink chlorox regularly FTW
---
Okay thanks 
---
Sometimes you can hear explosions and gunfire carrying pretty far across the wasteland. It's neat when you hear that and open the map and see there's people over there. Have not heard clanking sounds though.
---
I dont see why that makes sense. When someone fires a weapon the rest of us dont ? Why would time slowing and being able to switch targets crash the server ?
---
&gt; From 76? Uh, okay... I guess older Fallouts don't exist.
---
That's a freakout to you?
---
OP clearly worded their post to make it seem as if they though that this super sledge specifically originates from 76. All I did was point out that existed in 4.
---
No not till a week on Tuesday, but not long to wait
---
My gt is a7xogg
---
Whitesprings nuke zone in survival mode with all available xp boosts
---
Or the “stand on a plate” mechanics like in destiny that force a certain number of call outs and well coordinated players vs raw DPS like SBQ. 
---
Damn. That's not a CAMP. That's a actual building. If not for the turrets, I would walk right by this and not even realize.
---
Go hang out around the prime fissure and battle the scorched and Spam Beasts, no PA allowed!
---
Its fun cause as all those unbalanced builds get nerfed i sitting over here waiting for pistols to get some love.
---
Holy crap, what's wrong with your rolling pin?
---
I can't say it i liked it much either.
---
woo, I was hoping that survival would end up like path of exiles seasons!
---
What system are you on? If ps4 can give you one. If not, one spawns on the top of Poseidon in a little trailer shack thing.
---
I just got the game 2 days ago. I have many years/hours in Fallout games on console and PC, and was cautiously optimistic when FO76 came out but deferred because of the release feedback.
---
I finally bought because:
---
* it was on sale; I think the game's price deters many from trying it
---
* the latest patch addressed some of my non-voluntary-PVP concerns
---
I am about 6 hours in and I have absolutely no regrets. It has 90% of the feel of FO4, which to me is a good thing.
---
I love rolling pins as weapons. Maybe I phrased it wrong
---
A blodies lever action, I decided to try longshot instead of concentrated fire, why i cant headshot. Berry mentats i think they are called, reveal nearby living creatutes.
---
Took me five hours to get away from the Vault area, give it some more time and bash some more quests or just go full survival and try to escape the Spawn Camps.
---
Re-read your last post
---
They’re probably planning on releasing them in a future update.
---
Thank you ..
---
Yeah, it's 10 plastic for 1 unit of shells, and then bulking other junk to sell too
---
I happy to see other people are able to have fun at low levels. Just can't fucking deal with people who can one-shot. Hope you don't encounter those. Enjoy!
---
I’ve had a good laugh thanks to you. I feel like it’s a compliment, hopefully it is, anyway thanks for your comment.
---
Probably - though I don’t know what they’re waiting for since the assets are already sitting there.  
---
If they were made as key endgame content then that’d force PvE players into PvP
---
And this isn't the first thread about this matter.
---
My guess is that it's just ambient noises associated with that location.
---
I strongly disagree with an increase in legendary drops. Survival mode was already a big enough gift to the dupers who cheated the economy. Giving them more legendary drops, while they torment players who didn't participate in the duping economy, would be a slap in the face to casual players.
---
it only counts starred enemies, and you may need to get the killing blow as well
---
Not more often, but more times.  
---
You're right that any individual character may not have.  They simply could have.
---
It's a better approximation than time played, but still not a perfect one.
---
It should also be equal level to the level of enemy it drops from...or nearest higher rank.  Any  level 40-42 enemy should drop 45 gear and anything 50+ should be  45 or 50.
---
https://www.facebook.com/groups/902623373119013/permalink/2071318926249446/ This was probably the guy who started the event!
---
Awe, you fixed it, now it makes my replies look dumb. :-(
---
don't forget the perk that gives you luck for drinking alcohol.  I think it's in charisma or endourance, and one to double alchohol effects.  good luck and good hunting
---
I killed 6 out of 6 kill 1 legendary of each species 
---
That's a great idea! A sorta prologue to before. I love it 
---
3* Vampires pump action shotgun, bullets explode, and 50% less damage while aiming. I have almost no use for stimpacks anymore I love it 
---
Happy to do so! Next up I'm working on a Commando with a heart of gold, his mission is to find lower levels and help get them started.
---
Sounds pretty good! I wish there was a PvP  survival mode / ramped up difficulty mode without wipes seasons or scoreboards. 
---
Screenshot? No Facebook for me. 
---
You need a clean toilet to be up close and pernonal after eating the mystery meat (´ཀ\`)
---
nail on the head for me 2 thank you for typing this out for me
---
No no - if you watch the panel, it seemed to me that the seasons would be separate than survival as it is now. They made a point to say folks that just want to have a deathmatch like experience(my words not said by the devs) should have a place to do so
---
Sorry, don't know who that is.
---
What did they mean by new characters? Are we really gonna have to restart over and over again to play survival?
---
The menu music drives me batty. It's way too dramatic and grandiose for something that you sometimes have just sitting on for a while 
---
I'm on PC
---
1-3* legendary enemies and you must deal 100% of the damage to them. Shared kills seem to not be counted.
---
I've just been hanging out in survival, doing quests in remote locations and constantly checking the map for events.
---
Maybe I've had a lot of luck, but I've managed to get 24/25 almost exclusively from doing leader of the pack and uranium fever.
---
Only a twice out of 5 runs has uranium fever been too crowded for me to get the final blow. I don't see a lot of people doing events, perhaps because they're too busy killing each other at the train stations.
---
Since they said "added" I guess we'll still have normal survival **BUT** they also add seasons for those who like to start a fresh char now and then
---
Oh geez......
---
Now Bethesda is encouraging the one shot killing of legendaries before anyone else gets to tag it?...... isn't that what got us into the whole TSE nerf?
---
After the 2/19 patch, they simply aren't worth bothering with.  They are much easier to contest now.  That by itself wouldn't be a problem if workshops were productive.  The problem is that they are not. 
---
Take for example the ammo factory. 
---
If you know how to farm and have the right perks, 95 percent of your ammo will come from crafting.  The ammo workshop can only provide you with a very small bonus. 
---
Simply put, it's not worth fighting for or even risking it.

He's younger than us but he's into retro gaming including DOS.
---
[LGR](https://www.youtube.com/user/phreakindee/videos)
---
The mode is murderous enough without increasing the legendary spawn rate. I agree that something else is required to make it interesting. I just don't know what.
---
Damn I just got rid of like 5 legendary handguns I had been toting around. Always late to the party. 
---
Dude, I'd be down as well. My Katherine is a bit of a lush, what with needing the extra carry weight and all. So I'd be up for this. 
---
Yeah that's a good point. I suppose they'd need to fix the duping issues first. I can't seem to think of another suggestion though, this game revolves around getting legendary gear. 
---
As for the tormenting I've largely avoided pvp while playing the mode, but that could just be due to my experience with the game. 
---
Who knows? Maybe they don’t want any backlash for releasing items that were free in Fallout 4. Or it might just be remnants from the Fallout 4 game files. Similar to how the Vault 101 vault suit is present in the game files of Fallout 4.
---
Last hour. Arrived at uranium fewer there was last legendary, i killed it with two shots, apparently someone did last damage. So i was running some spawns killed 5non star legendaries. Then i did horde event just to have legendary spawn inside of house where another mobs killed it. This game is fucking shit. Oh my god. I beg you, don't try to do it lol
---
Wisdom....pure wisdom
---
I got it from a workshop claim or defend. I don’t remember which, I’ve gotten 4-5 of them so far. I claim gorge and the dirt track a lot, chances are it was one of those. 
---
Bethesda :)
---
I was taking out some lvl 68 Scorched the other day, VATsing them with my Instigating .50 sniper rifle and I end up vatsing a Prizebot as he rushed towards me from out of nowhere...only for the Scorched to find me, from my hidden state.
---
That's traditionally how seasons have worked in games like Diablo 3. You get as far as you can with a new character working on specific challenges that give you unique rewards for the season. So you might keep a main character and then make one specifically for the season. In Diablo 3, you get all the loot and money from your seasonal character transferred to your main character after the season ends, so it all comes back around.
---
My 3* stalkers rolling pin cause I laughed my ass off when I checked the pull.
---
Well if that’s the case there’s no harm in me modding in the assets they abandoned. 
---
I think it comes down to them wanting you to put points in SPECIAL stats to be good at shooting. There is no auto-aim, like there is in similar games, many enemies are fast and small (liberators!), and your shots have a LOT of spread and recoil. 
---
Coupled with poor server connection (fallout 76) I sometimes am 100% sure I hit a target, but do no damage. 
---
The engine is just old in general, and designed around you being able to literally say "I want to hit...that guy, in the...head" without actually aiming. Someone with more game design experience could probably explain WHY it is so bad, but other than the Deus Ex series, I've never played shooters with aim as bad as fallout. Not even close. 
---
It definitely is a compliment! &lt;3 I wish I could make that kind of base. Mine's well off the road but with player vending spots being marked, I'm hoping to be ok. If only I could get past my desire to have a good view T_T
---
Same. Maybe they could increase the rates outside of the typical legendary farming spots so players are a bit more spread out? I just don't like seeing this mode go waste. Maybe Nuclear Winter mode will be a PvE mode similar to this. 
---
Thankfully I can manage anything on the ground, close quarters, or a smaller area. 
---
Anything significantly long range and flying is out of the picture for me. I'm definitely going to try to solo it my first go-around as I did for the nuke silos, excited to see how far I can get before saying "nope, need friends". 
---
Maybe a small matchmaking? That'd be kinda cool
---
I've seen literally dozens.  Seems a popular choice.
---
Take over Gorge workshop. Very low risk, high reward WRT Black Titanium.
---
I agree completely! I had been avoiding this game for obvious reasons until about a week and a half ago, when I decided to finally get it because I was really getting into the lore of Fallout and this is the only one I hadn't tried yet.
---
My god, I'm so ashamed of myself for the wasted time I spent making fun of this "mess". I am in love with this game! Its the perfect game to just come home to after work and spend a few hours working on levelling up, getting better gear, and exploring the lore. 
---
And the community has been absolutely fantastic. I was a massive GTAV player, so to move from that toxic community to this game, where the first hour I was playing by myself and a random level 33 came up to me, said hello, and gave me some decent equipment that I am still using to this day! I love the people playing this game and on this subreddit!
---
I am only level 19, and I can't wait to just keep levelling up and fully explore this beautiful map!
---
Me too.
---
Stealth is your friend.
---
I've set up my pistoleir to do the most damage at night with sneak attacks  &amp; take the most damage with a good collection of nocturnal armour if I get seen.
---
I'm so damn squishy during the day if I get seen by enemies I run away fast to then hide again.
---
Makes the game a bit interesting.
---
If they "just want to PvP", why don't they fight each other?
---
Do u know how much you get on average?
---
Posted a screenshot on my profile 
---
Glad I'm not the only one, fed up having to make this choice each time and suffer that sound.
---
I have time, but I don't want to. It is against the logic of RPG and having to develop/progress character.
---
Hardcore, you die. You dead. Start over.
---
I'm glad you joined are you on Xbox by the way?
---
I get at least three weapons every time I do a round at The WhiteSprings
---
Lmao pistols needs some love maybe some armor piercing perks and maybe a perk that does double damage like 10% of the time.
---
Barbarian + iron clad + the agility perk(I can’t remember the name offhand). I hate the PA UI, so I use this and take less damage even in nuke zones just wearing a hazmat suit. It adds up
---
It is a big gamble. I usually check for where all the death bags are and make a decision based on where the fighting is. I usually end up camping Watoga when I inevitably get shown my location on the leaderboard.
---
I've found a few combat armor helmets in the wild. No idea if they do anything for headshot resist though. 
---
Persistent CAMPs would require a persistent server assignment too, so you'd also need a lot more players to be able to play on one server at once.
---
20 per hour. Log on, claim the workshop, set up the extractor (if it's not already set up from the last player), go off and do stuff, come back as needed to empty it. Plus it's a free extra fast travel point while you're running the workshop.
---
I’m on Xbox and I’ve been trying to find the helmet for ages, went to every place especially harpers ferry and could never find it, I went on different forums and many claimed that it’s a dev room item and only PV users have it or some say it’s obtainable in game. (Referring to the marine armor helmet not the tactical)
---
Sadly they do not you can give them the bos paint by scrapping them and getting lucky for the plan but it still won’t add armor protection just change the color to match your set 
---
Where are the 40% swing speed, bloodied, weightless signs at Bethesda???
---
Oh, I think I've seen some of his videos actually. Thanks, I'll check it out some more.
---
The leader board thing that shows those players on the map
---
I’m sorry. I don’t like swearing in permanent format
---
I play this game by myself and I enjoy it. The other players, especially now that PvE and PvP are separate, are not an issue. Although I would DEFINITELY enjoy it more if I could play offline so that I wouldn't have to worry about lag or server disconnects.
---
They could do it like GTA Online, if you survive an entire in-game day with the bounty, you get the bounty amount.
---
On the imgur there are a couple and a couple mote on the gram. Msg me if you want to see more. 
---
Just depends on what you want to do. Melee is good for general fast game play. Rifles are good for survival and easy game play. Heavy weapons/PA is good for SQ farming. 
---
Well. Get yourself to Poseidon if you want a hazmat suit. As far as sellable crafted items... Many people do different things and there are bunches of low cost to craft yet still profitable items you can make. Any civil war hat plan would work for you. 
---
&gt; I suppose they'd need to fix the duping issues first. 
---
I don't think that duping goes on anymore, but the damage is done. They world was flooded with OP duped items early on and they are here to stay unless Bethesda removes them all, which I don't think they will. 
---
I've said that all duped items should be removed, I get down voted by people who claim they got their OP gear honestly, because they bought them with caps or real world money (from people who had obviously duped them). 
---
I guess it doesnt sound like a bad idea, where is it on the map?
---
Well if it’s a dev room item then that means they have plans of releasing it soon and hopefully they’ll add damage resist stats on it even if it’s only minor
---
Whenever I visit the Insane Asylum (Fort Defiance) I always hear clanging of metal and stuff being dropped/thrown as if someones rummaging around  somewhere.
---
I do. About to get on, GT is same as name here. Send me a message and I'll invite you, need a few minutes to get settled
---
Sinse I don't find any location challenging for a solo player, maybe soloing a 4 player area will be really exciting.
---
And here i am frustrated 15hours looking for 25legendary mobs, to get useless weapon.
---
Priorities
---
Exactly.
---
If a game company feels they need the additional "service" income for a game that has an upfront cost, this is about the best (for the players) way to do it.  As far as I've seen it's been completely optional cosmetics, so far.
---
That said, the end game here is almost 100% pure grind, that's not unusual for a "service" game but...  Someone who hates grind should expect maybe 10 hours or more, depending on how much they enjoy just wandering around, of fairly typical modern Fallout gameplay and then effectively be done with the game.  On the plus side, someone who doesn't mind grind, at least somewhat, potentially has a long term place to put their gaming hat AND get free game currency at the same time.
---
I agree, especially they should fix the other helmets that don’t have any dr
---
No problem, I'm deleting my above comments now then, as it seems to be annoying people.
---
Like a typical drunk. 😉
---
Yeah I was just listing one that i got a decent one from.  Good luck!
---
I have managed to avoid being brutally murdered and robbed as a level 40 by hiding and asking in open chat, "Hello! Are you here to brutally murder and rob me?"
---
That seems to work. I even managed to survive the end of an event.

Are you on PC?

I'd love to buy some Flux I always have trouble getting it.

---
Yes please. I run a peaceful establishment. Bring them along, by all means, (the neighbours like to take pot shots at my walls sometimes), but there'll be no need for them inside.
---
That's exactly what I'm thinking.  Clear the dungeon except for the very last boss?  You, my solo friend, just won.
---
Thanks for the help man
---
That is so funny my husband was there too. He actually said "It's a race!" As he was running and He was kicked off too!!!! LOL
---
Wait? You can craft fusion cores?
---
Black titanium can be found mostly down in the coal region of the map in the southeast. Kill the mole miners and a piece of their suit will scrap for black titanium and some other stuff. Just tag it for search and it will always pop up for you. I'm not sure about selling the throwing knifes, but 2500 is definitely overboard. Lol. And I could build my camp twice with 600 wood, let alone 1000😂. Also, if you plan on sticking with melee, look into super sledges. I've been using one for months now. It kind of also depends on whether you tend to run around in power armor or out of it, because they can only be equipped outside of it, but if you do run around without power armor, deathclaw gauntlets are pretty good if you can get your hands on one. And maybe look into perks too. I forgot about those. Some make junk weigh less and some make aid items weigh less. Some can make armor weigh less. Just keep an eye out. And finally, try to find the quest for the Excavator power armor. It adds 100 carry weight if you wear the full set. You might google the quest though because it's been so long that I've forgotten where to go to start it
---
Start squatting those resource locations now folks. Seems like after this, you won't ever find one that's not occupied 
---
I’m glad it is! I’m sure you can accomplish anything you desire in this game if you give yourself some time. Feel free to reproduce anything you see here. And yes, having a great view is great. I have a friend who has a nice little C.A.M.P. near the Wendigo cave. She has an amazing view, and I really envy her. But, being surrounded by nature, in a really quiet and not often visited location feels also fantastic to me.
---
Thanks, Im not used to using incur so I somehow saw the top pic and completely missed the rest.
---
I fucking love it my dude, great job and Good luck with the concert!
---
Yeah there are helmets I understand that wouldn’t have a crazy amount of dr like the fire breathers helmet but the combat armor helmet if anything should have at least 5 or 10 dr and should be able to modify them with attachments like bright light or bio mesh 
---
?
---
private server and mod support?  omg, finally ! 😆
---
I wonder when they might implement that. When they do, I will happily buy it.
---
All these points were exceptionally well written, totally agree on all points, I would like to suggest maybe workshops not allowing free fast travel to when an event is going on?  100% guarantee someone is defending their workshop and everyone knows you can fast travel there for a fight with someone involved (most likely) in defending their shop from a wave of somethings.
---
The train stations are a big issue though, however, I think people would still camp there with stealth boys until someone leaves the train station as have happened to me a few times too.  So while that is a great idea, hard to really fix it all I suppose.
---
Your salty downvotes and limpdick attempt at a clapback just prove that I hit the nail on the head.
---
I like how they say "Normally we put out DLC and then 3 days later you are done. With F76 we can release this content over 3 months"- Do these guys even play or have played online games? Feels like they still look at F76 as an singleplayer game, what explains why F76 every aspect of game is somewhat broken and don't work at all.
---
I'm pretty sure they just don't really want people doing this. 
---
I'm getting like rolling pins And stuff. I'm like 64 and it's starting to get kinda redic
---
And do you have the mod or trying to craft one? If you have the mod you can just install it even tho it shows you the materials needed. 
---
I played in BETA. Made it to about 27 on my first character. Figured out what I wanted to do, and built [This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f634e86&amp;d=s22sq2sw2s32sr2pq1pj0pm2eh2cr0cu2ib4ic2ir2ip2a04a72lt2ls2&amp;w=&amp;n=Heavy) once the game launched.  It's been a blast! Best part? Heavy weapons have the biggest variety of weapons to play with, by far. Especially if you factor in Heavy Launchers.
---
I play a low health PVE setup, so Adrenal Reaction, Bloodied weapons (or instigating or twoshot or furious, depending on the weapon and the target ;), Nerd Rage, Emergency Protocols torso for PA. It's brutally effective and still relatively tanky. You can swap quite a few perks around as desired- Exterminator for Glow Sights (I run Exterminator for those pesky Mirelurk armors; but glow sights is amazing in Whitespring nukes), Tenderizer for Suppressor, or all 4 for Lone Wanderer (I started off playing solo so that was the original 4 charisma, but now I am grouped), Luck perks can be swapped all over as none are essential, just situational. Class Freak and Starched Genes? Check! (I don't run Starched all the time, I'm good at avoiding excessive rads, and power armor reduces rad intake dramatically all the time; I just swap in Starched when I need to take a rad-away, but I also have Sun Kissed for passive rad reduction). Feeling too vulnerable? Swap some stuff around, add Suppressor, Serendipity, Blocker; bam, enemies deal 30% less damage, you take 45% less melee damage, and straight up avoid 45% of damage.
---
I was just saying this aloud to myself the other day.
---
They must've already had survival mode in their timeline before the duping happened. The duping error will probably go down in the history books of video game programming as the most epic blunder ever 
---
Jw how do you create a bar? I have a distiller, too much power, etc but how would you supply to others for your monetary gain? 
---
would be a good thought/practice to put in place.. when i rolled my melee character at lvl 30 i had her in whitesprings 1 shoting lvl 68 ghouls, waited until 35 to run her on her first queen run, hit queen maybe once or twice to get on loot pool but after that spent rest of my time killing adds of the heavy gunners and avoiding the mirelurk queens/fog crawlers/bears and such that could 1 shot me.. and even then in the flurry of running from dog to tick to scorched to deathclaw i still noticed lvl 20s to 40s hiding in the shed and not even bother to shoot at anything, or afking.   
---
if youre not in the fight youre a hinderance, and need to leave since ya making those actually working on killing the queen use alot more ammo to make up for your (not literal more of a general to those afkers reading this) lack of help..  
---
i speak to any low level person heading to a queen run, you have a duty to try and kill something, yeah pot shot the queen get you a hit in, and then your job becomes "protect the gunners, the mini guns, the 50 cals, the machine gunners" dont worry bout the melee theyll be fine.. but your the first line of defense to those heavy guns.. take the death protect those guys, let them keep their eyes on the queen.. 
---
M_string
---
I think that this will be a private server feature, sort of like minecraft servers. Have a password protected server that keeps changes made to the world in place.  People will police themselves. 
---
Pure cringe
---
...what
---
It's been there since beta. Dead serious. It's like a staging area. 
---
Nice dude, I'll be on soon
---
I just love chameleon gear
---
downvote me harder bb. i am almost cumming.
---
I don't have a mod, I'm on Xbox one x but I do have the plans to construct it
---
Yes, at the chemistry station. The recipe:  
---
1 Pure Cobalt Flux
---
1 Pure Fluorescent Flux
---
1 Pure Violet Flux
---
1 Pure Crimson Flux
---
1 Pure Yellowcake Flux
---
[ ](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Chemistry_station)
---
 Also, running the Line in the Sand event will always give you 2 cores, with an 86 percent charge.
---
I think it’s under energy ammo but I could be wrong but yes you can craft them at a tinkers workbench. I don’t bother with workshops either
---
I one shot them, maybe thats the issue ?

1. This needed to happen.  It solves most if not all of the major problems with Survival mode.  People won't be able to bring in their already decked out characters, won't be able to run away to the safety of Adventure to restock and recoup and it will allow people to get in on the mode late with each new season and not be at a major disadvantage.  Requiring new characters for the mode like people have been complaining for would have been a horrible move, but wiping those characters regularly makes it work.
---
3. I REALLY hope they come up with an in game means of more easily grouping up with people then, because as a solo player it's always a pain in the ass in games like this when content requires you to group up with strangers but you have to use third party sites just to find people.
---
4.  I was hoping this was where the legendary vendor would be going and I'm glad they went in this direction.  As a plus anyone stockpiling legendary gear on a mule character to trade can relax since you won't be needing to stockpile three stars to exchange for other three stars and can just farm up crap legendaries to trade in builk when the time comes.
---
5. God no.  I know people want to build settlements with their friends but the game just isn't built that way.  I mean for this to work out they'd need to do something like tying characters to specific servers so that your camp is always there, and then there's the question of what happens when you've got a camp in popular area... it could end up a huge mess.
---
I was sad when I heard that also but honestly playing ESO dungeons with randies wasn't too bad. I just hope I have organized people lmao.
---
They come into the bar and we trade basically I just make food and drinks
---
Yeah, like destiny raids.
---
Xbox one x. I had the plans and that's what I'm working off of.
---
I've got an AA 10mm pistol I've had since I hit level 50 (level 130 now) it's actually not terrible but it still lacks some punch, even when I have my sandman and other sneaky perks that increase damage with silenced weapons with a suprressor on it..And my AA 10mm is kitted out with all the good stuff, suppressor, hardened receiver and a perforating magazine (it's named the Anti-Armour Armour piercing, hardened 10mm, god this custom weapon naming can't come soon enough lol) Though, I'm also not running any pistol perks...
---
I love my 10mm but It's mainly only good for mobs &lt;30 ...although, if I can land constant sneak attacks, I can take down a level 50 protectron pretty quick....
---
Yeah that looks like garbage 👎🏻 yeah that needs a fix
---
Seriously! If I didnt have a camp I think I wouldn't enjoy the game as much as I do. 
---
wat

[link to what I’m talking about ](https://imgur.com/gallery/fwjI41U)

Eveyone is hidden on map until bein in the top 3 longest life, it seems.

so "legendary" in the name isnt enough then?

I find the Handmade rifle is the best. It's also more satisfying to fire for some unknown reason.

Yea. I spawned to the Whitespring station, got spawn killed. Then I spawned station north of the Whitespring, got spawn killed. Spawned shouth of the Whitespring train station, got spawn killed. Seemed like a team of people laying that trap. Lost 400 caps on every death. Eventually got the caps back but it was not very fun
---
Damn that’s a long time! Thanks for the info

Those "dungeons" probably aint dungeons, they are just underground locations. Dungeon in MMO is one thing, this just...this is not dungeons, what they are talking about are just location, not "dungeon".
---
I find it funny how the bolt is on the right side of the gun in the poster, but it's on the left in game
---
Google it or try again 
---
It may just be a case of specifying the maximum number allowed.  Lots of more MMO like games with raid content allow you to bring in multiple teams while in this case they're being specific that only a maximum of one team of four will be able to participate at a time.  Being for four players doesn't necessarily mean they're going to lock out anyone that tries to go in in groups of 1-3.
---
Did you ever find it 
---
__I killed 6 out of 6 kill 1 legendary of each species__
---
Ha ha that's pretty good. I don't have the courage for open mic, but I guess I'll give it a shot. My character is currently running around naked at level 22 so that could be part of the reason I receive mercy. Either that or because I don't carry aid/junk on me. 
---
I think it's kind of fucked up that 4 fusion cores only gets you 150 caps but that's just me. Does this game even have a stable economy
---
Graham has them occasionally but he’s hard to find and doesn’t have the same flux every time
---
Yeah I know right? Honestly, the mere existence of legendary gear in this game is mind boggling to me.    The concept of lebendary weapons was first introduced in Fallout 4. Fallout 4 is a single player game. So god- tier, over powered weapons and armor is no big deal. 
---
The idea of introducing the same RNG dependent legendary effects into a multiplayer game is mind boggling to me.    It makes no sense at all. But when you add duping into the mix, it's more or less permanently damaged. 
---
probably like the workbench in AWKCR in the fallout 4 mods, each weapon you craft or obtain that isn't already legendary would have a set number of legendary slots.  You could scrap a two-shot  western revolver, an explosive laser pistol, get an explosive token and a 2 shot token, and then apply those tokens to craft or upgrade a TSE shotgun.  I'm betting the legendary tier precedence still applies, like 2 shot and anti-armor and etc are specifically SLOT1,  explosive, reduced weight are SLOT2 etc. to keep you from making a 4 shot by combining two 2 shot tokens.  They probably won't let you swap out tokens on the fly, (like they don't let you swap receivers) although that would be nice, not so good for grinding.
---
See I would gladly play it. But I have $5 to my name and no sales to go for, so I cant. Feels bad man, heard its really pulling itself together now
---
I wasnt thinking 10 maybe like 2 or 3, but yea I was thinking primarily base effects i see your point also, I just hate the rng lotto
---
No and none 
---
Yes, I've come across him from time to time. Thanks 😊
---
Nothing can kill Graham. 
---
I hope it's somewhat like The Division's recalibration system.
---
I'm so glad the literally hundreds of legendary items I've been saving won't all be useless haha. 
---
You just physically can’t kill him. Does he fight back if attacked
---
I think I just lost a few IQ points trying to read that jibberish. Lol
---
Thats awesome, man!
---
or allow closer overlapping ranges so we can get together and make shantytowns like New Gad, but full of actual people.
---
Hmm. Honestly I’ve been happy enuff with my build I hadn’t looked at party boy at all. That makes sense. 
---
Might be time to shuffle a little....
---
‘Left
---
I found him standing in a fissure site. In the bottom. He can't die.
---
God that shit drives me crazy. really annoying. They fixed the sparking thing but created this problem
---
He doesn't do anything when attacked by players 
---
I’ve got about 250 hours in the game, with a lot coming from the month after release. I still play a couple of times a week. I’m level 78. I haven’t even started endgame stuff. Having a blast. Exploring the map, finding Easter eggs, trying different daily events and side quests have all been a blast to me. But, to each their own. 
---
 kill 6 legendary’s 1 of each kind like 1 super mutant, 1 robot , etc ok👍🏼
---
This sounds very pointless. 
---
Its my fav outfitas far as looks and you are dead on , it just sucks.  At least the Marine Stuff, which is sorta cool looking can be found as Legendary and you can build a pretty cool kit with time and patience
---
I swear there was one at my very first Fasnacht. My headcanon is just gonna be that I was playing with Todd checking on his baby.
---
And sentinel armor ;-)
---
Yeah, pretty dumb to spend money on atoms unless you are wealthy.  Just do dailies and be more selective.
---
Try picking up multiple legendaries, The sounds seems to stack. Helped a mate transferring to a mule I picked up 100+ legendaries.
---
 I know have to learn sign. 
---
Sometimes I'm not sure myself 
---
There's a cave in the mire...  Hawk's Refuge. It has an insect spawn with a pile of different insects and always a few ants. A few as in, usually two or three. It's enough to complete the quest at least.
---
Well, that was kind of the idea of the game to begin with. And if you aren't doing pvp, who cares if you have the top tier stuff.  Game would still be fun without it.
---
Also, they could revamp it to not be pvp based, and just monster horde vs defending players.
---
There will always be more, and I will be here.

It's not like you are going to run into other players all the time specially as a low level. I hardly see anyone. 
---
I recently got a 50 Super Sledge with Furious and 40% faster swing.  With Martial Artist that things swings faster than my unarmed character's weapon.
---
Someone needs to ban your internet 😂
---
*3\* Instigating Combat Knife.  +40% power attack damage, double damage if target is full health, +90% reduced weight.*  
---
May have been the first 3\* I found.  This thing pretty much destroys on the first hit, and if it doesn't, there's a lot more stabbing where that came from.
---
*3\* Furious Mole Miner Gauntlet.  Take 40% less damage while power attacking, +40% power attack damage, damaged increased after each consecutive hit on the same target.*  
---
This thing becomes quite beastly on low health.  Also, it just looks cool.
---
*2\* Vampire's Combat Knife.  Reflects 50% of melee damage back when blocking, gain brief health regenration when you hit an enemy.*  
---
It doesn't hit as hard as the other weapons, but the speed of stabbing means my health stays pretty much topped off as long as I'm hitting things.  I can get through most Super Mutant battles and come out ahead in terms of HP.
---
*3\* Suppressor's Lever Action Rifle.  Faster movement speed while aiming, bullets explode for area damage, reduce your target's damage output by 20% for 3s.*  
---
This was another of my original 3\*'s.  It's explosive, pretty much always staggers Scorchbeasts, and ammo is plentiful.  Weirdly though, I'm convinced this once had a +10% movement speed increase, which was awesome.  Now it's "faster movement speed while aiming" and seemingly less so.
---
*1\* Quad Hardened Combat Shotgun*  
---
With Enforcer and 34 shots per reload, this thing *will* cripple.
---
*1\* Quad Cryolator*  
---
With the Crystallizing Barrel and 100 shots per reload, the Scorchbeast Queen will be frozen.
---
Well, just did one last session. Seems plenty enough are nuking. On weekend always more.
---
Are you sure they had a star next to the name? There's a lot of legendary enemies with zero stars. One-shotting the starred legendaries didn't give me any issues.
---
I love that in the important news panel they included that Todd's avatar is a big dude in a kinky girls outfit 😂😂😂
---
Like that Quad Western.... quick hands don't proc and your left reloading 24 bullets one by one into a revolver.
---
What system and what are you looking for? I may have something to part with.
---
There's a PC mod to get rid of a few of the most annoying sounds. Maybe the author will add this to it.
---
I’ll look you up and add you. My IGN is same as here. 
---
The game was unplayable at first and that ruined it permanently for people. Just like no man sky
---
If it will possibly spawn you under the map it will force a camp move 
---
Lucky.
---
Besides a Good Post(You could have broken down everything i 2 paragraphs)  i need too tell you Bethesda don't know what the term Karma means and never knew.  The reason why their fallout games don't have it is because they don't like it. The Karma System from the Original Fallout Creators is a wanted feature since Fallout turned into 3D. :D
---
It's kind of like when people talk about one-shot builds.
---
You might kill in one-shot about 80% of the time.  The rest of the time, you're at the mercy of the server. 😂
---
If you haven't tried it yet, it's pretty much that image but it stays in one place while you move around and shoot. It's like a floating bullet casing that's the size of the gun.
---
Yup, laser weapons give 10 if you use scrapper. I am at over 500 plastic and I don't even try to farm it. 
---
I've found that I can start the wire with SPACE but then to connect the other end instead of space I have to hit "E" otherwise, like you, I just jump.
---
Then there are times it wont' connect at all so I have to exit build mode, and go back in and then it will work.
---
It's alot of walking, can't fast travel unless it's nukashine roulette, Have to take a break whilst walking to regain my AP 
---
On the plus side you do see plenty of the map and see some sweet scenic views and you save caps because you don't use them to fast travel.
---
I have about 143 stims, 200+ radaway and diluted, atom knows how much ammo, water, food etc.. 
---
I've been like this for 3 months now
---
I can deal with individuals but as you said, when it’s 3 or 4 against one it’s no longer fun.
---
IMO it’s not that slow. But it was way too fast when the game first came out. 
---
But for your answer I like to clear out places like Huntersville and West Tek in survival.
---
Thank you guys, we might check it out again then.
---
Yeah, i have more than 800 on my main, but now i started a new char i intended to use shotgun. I'll visit Morgantown highschool often it ssems.
---
&gt;attacked by players
---
Key phrase. He'll whomp the hell out of scorched, other muties, etc if they attack him. But not players.
---
TLDR; Just grind Legendarys and get a Explosive Weapon. Get the Perk cards for this weapon. Find Sentinel Armor Set.  Go into Survival.  Find a good Spawn point. Stand still and wait. use Vats to aim and shoot. Its easy as breathing :D 
---
Look at the sellers on the marketplace and the bazaar on Reddit.
---
Same!
---
Helmets lack DR and ER intentionally so you don't have to sacrifice appearance for stats. Helmets and hats cannot be worn together, so any players who want their character to look good would miss out on stats that could potentially be the difference between life and death in combat and challenges.
---
I like this. 
---
&gt;After they got done making them worse, then they made them infinitely harder to defend. 
---
Yeah, they basically just turned them into PVP zones where raiders can ignore your defenses and  the workshop owner is at a built in disadvantage. 
---
All I ever meet. Finding also that most places on the map are empty apart from Whitesprings. 
---
So, this is some nonspecific advice, but I think it will be helpful: plan your perks. There are plenty of sites out there and several companion apps that tell you what perks are out there. Find the ones that will apply to your character. You will obviously want all the commando perks (although a personally suggest going with semi-auto and rifleman perks), and then figure out the rest of what you want. Do you want to stealth on PvE and surprise some creatures? Or are you planning a PvP build with the highest DPS? Either way, plan your perks, count your special, and level up right. 
---
I have a small razoegrain farm going currently. What I really need are a few workshops that allow for lead, acid, and gunpowder so I can fuel an automatic weapons habit.

I can stand a gang but a gang with tard gaurd outfits is the worst i hate seeing the mr fuzzy head linger in the distance with its deathclaw gauntlet 
---
I would try a stealth approach but I recently got 2 tse shotguns, one pump, and another combat, i kinda just wanted to run and gun with those outside of PA being a little bit more maneuverable. I guess ill try adding ironclad and a few others on my person while still keeping the possibility of using PA possible.

I know this is a old post but if you are on PlayStation I will give you my two shot explosive minigun for it along with 3000 caps

This map will help you find lot's of places. https://fo76map.com.
---
I'm glad a lot won't. That way Bethesda will see that they shouldn't release shit show games with overpriced models inside of it and a plethora of problems. Fallout 4 was so great, yeah it wasn't perfect but they were trying new ideas. Fallout 76 was just Bethesda trying to cash out and get some bucks by betting on the online game craze right now and the fallout fan base. 
---
Nice cheers man!
---
Bethesda is notorious for feeding you some hype shit than disappointing you. 
---
Hello,  
---
Very nice reading your advices , I haven't tried the survial mode for my self yet, but I'm keeping your post onto fav it will be usefull.  
---
I was wondering thought, how do the unbalanced combats let say dude with his 450 lvled up toon, vs homie with his 45 lvl up ?
---
lol :)    
---
More of a primer for PvE ers who want to get into Survival mode to try and get the new weapons
---
I thought survival mode was all new characters? How is bringing fully geared characters over any fun?
---
Well if you wanna look stylish while being combat ready maybe helmets that should add DR and ER like the military helmet, combat helmet, and marine helmet can be used as like the rest of the armor pieces and be hid underneath a hat or stylish piece so if say I had my combat helmet on that gave me some DR but I wanna wear my tin foil hat to contact the aliens I could wear said combat helmet that provides protection like the rest of my armor then put on my tin foil hat and that would hide the fact I’m wearing the combat helmet not replace it 
---
ESO has public dungeons. It can be something similar.
---
Honestly, I found just questing to be the most reliable and rich source of XP. Your mileage may vary, as you want to do it quickly so not clearing an area of enemies, unlocking all doors/terminals etc might net you a lot less XP than I did as I explored everywhere. 
---
Question: before I buy the camo bundle, can you confirm that the camo power armor paint included in the bundle is the same as the Woodland Warrior paint?  It looks very similar, but it's hard to tell, and the WW paint is limited time offering (2 more days) while the bundle has 6 more days (beyond the WW paint exclusivity).  Thanks.
---
Probably could have got 50 a piece but I just needed 150 and honestly wanted to unload the cores. Would be nice if you had a minimum caps requirement, but I’m sure people would just drop items to bypass it. 
---
I'll have a look, thanks!
---
Wow, nice story!
---
Downvoted because it's 2019. We are awake and fully aware there is no "lord". But the OP is doing or has done good work. 
---
I feel they need to fix the top 3 not showing up on the map, the dying whilst loading in, and the rebound health bug ASAP
---
There's great fun to be had in rounding up a few mercenaries and actively stalking/hunting the leaderboard down

I have a bag in one of those. Grab it for me if you can.

Well, you'll be hard-pressed to miss the yellow school-bus Excavator PA with a battleaxe…….unless I'm sneaking up on you.
---
I approve of this as I am strangely mysterious myself.  
---
Too easy to manipulate and farm caps.
---
The scaling's crazy atm, so a low-level with a pipe pistol can kill you in 2-3 shots apparently.
---
In a way since the server kicked me I guessed I did. 
---
I don't know if the top 3 is broken. They disappear when crouched. Not sure if it was intended though. Otherwise, yeah toatally agree. It's a great mode with great times

No. I did it across 3 characters just in case.

I can stand a man in power armor but that stupid fuzzy head

(b) no longer human   
---
(c) wishes they were dead  
---
(d) really wants their nanny....
---
Soooo....did it happen?
---
The clanking just seems part of the ambient audio inside the power plants.
---
You did a really great job on it!
---
I'm pretty sure stealthboys are actively affecting it as well, which in my experience consists of the top 1-3 usually with a team, invisible camping train station spawns
---
At least if they showed through crouch/SB you could make a pinch or flank styled plan of attack!
---
Right, right. You've proved my point.
---
No more questions; your honor.
---
My "Basic" early load out (til level 35 or higher) hotkeys like this:  
---
1) Pistol (usually upgraded 10mm or a semi-auto rifle if I have rifle perks)
---
2) Melee Weapon (leveled Fire Axe until I get an ok Legendary)
---
3) Shotgun (leveled hardened Pump until I can get perforating mag for Combat Shotgun)
---
4) Whatever grenade I have most of
---
5) Something with a scope
---
6 &amp; 7 empty unless I find something fun or specialized. 
---
8- Purified Water
---
9- Rad away
---
0- Stimpak
---
After the levels get higher, I specialize much more (My HW guy main with Bear arms carries four 1\* Gatlings, a TS Minigun, Daisycutter, Bunkerbuster, and a \*\*\* M79 along with a Furious Fire Axe for melee..)  
---
It happened, made my own discord xD
---
sheepsquatch isn't released till a later update for wild Appalachia Bethesda probably added the name but not the creature
---
Indeed xD
---
Thanks. This is my first Reddit post. And granted, while it's indeed long winded as hell, I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of making a suggestion to Bethesda, there's no point in being brief. I'd rather outline my entire idea in as much detail in order to not just paint them the best picture, but also everyone else. Alas, I do know it then risks TL;DR as well... As such, if you're willing to condense it to what you feel are the key points, I'm happy to tack it on to the bottom as the TL;DR version (with direction to it at the top). :)
---
Admittedly, I've never played the originals, though I do own them in the Anthology Mini Nuke bundle. Even then, I came into FO3 quite a number of years after release, so I apologize for not having experience of it prior to that :\\ I just liked the sense of 'good and bad' that is otherwise absent from 76, seeing this as a potential integration of it. 
---
The benefit to having a visual indicator of who is good and bad --considering in real life we can at least get an initial judgement on someone as they approach based on their demeanor which is impossible in game-- would be that lower level players would know whether you're charging up to them to offer gives or lay you to rest! lol This was sort of the basis for the idea since a couple comments have asked for a "Gift" emote to tell the newbies "We come in peace!" :P
---
This is true my friend.
---
It’s basically become a trading game for me.
---
I don’t know why it should bother you that certain people who liked other FO games don’t like this one.  I’m one of those who don’t care for it.  I bought it on preorder and gave it a try. It’s just not my cup of tea. 
---
Glad others are enjoying it.  I might give it a try after a while when some of the bugs get ironed out. 
---
Nice build
---
&gt;But his job isn’t just to hype a product - it’s to represent the Bethesda brand.
---
Pretty much the same thing. The difference is, you want him to apologize for his company releasing an unfinished product. I get it, you weren't happy at launch. A lot of us were disappointed. But what does his apology do? Make you feel better about spending 60 dollars? Is an apology from Todd going to make you like the game all of a sudden if you didn't? 
---
Hopefully you learned a lesson in always buy games from stores that have a good refund policy and  watch reviews before buying. Because right now it sounds like you are saying "I've been a big fan of the series and have supported it, but I really want Todd to apologize and tell me everything is going to be okay". You don't like the game don't buy/play it!
---
There's also another aspect of this that I didn't even touch and thats the legal ramifications when being an executive at a billion dollar company. You can't make public statements and start apologizing for things like it's no big deal.
---
I got it on xbox too, but i don't need to exit build. I will just back out of the current wire and start the wire from the other end.
---
This is cute and all but why couldn't they just talk to you over area chat? Or fire their gun or anything?
---
A nuke can kill him as it turns him to ash but that's the only thing and nothing happens apart from his death of course.
---
It really depends if it mechanically locks it to four players, say for example to open a door all four need to stand on pressure plates.  
---
It could also be a soft lock where the mobs are balanced around fur lvl 50 players (Which wouldnt be easy to do)
---
True. Im sure all the kinks will be ironed out 
---
I feel like I want to be part of this blossoming team of xbox fo76 players. Invite?
---
Medic pumps might explain the healing. I am near impossible to kill as long as I have stimpaks.
---
I thought The guy I was building with was insane for saying we should build there  I never thought it would work. But here we are
---
Stepping into survival is like going to a school where everyone is a school shooter. rage killing bullies that done them wrong in the past. :D 
---
 b,c and d can still be situations where they grew up tbf, being human and having grown up may not be entirely likely with vault teks track record but it’s still possible.
---
Mighty solid words from a hollow gentleman! ;) Thank you.
---
This happened to me too, same spot with my camp getting deleted MULTIPLE times
---
I moved it a bit south on the train tracks and it was fine. Did about 30 relogs to make sure I wouldn’t get the error message again before rebuilding 🙄 All has been fine for like a week with many server hops. 
---
It would be nice if it wouldn’t let you rebuild in the same spot if it was just gonna kick you 5 logs later 
---
The Path to Enlightenment Event + Cranberry Relish + Well Rested, then find enemy dense areas like Harper's Ferry and West-Tek.  After clearing either location leave server and rejoin.  Enemies should respawn.  
---
Everything annoys these people. That's the problem with their generation. They can't handle different opinions.
---
Hey dude sounds like my kinda group you still around?
---
Technically it would be 50 vs 45. All levels above 50 are just cosmetic(new perk cards etc)
---
The fights are actually pretty balanced, some weapons are just completely ridiculous strong with the right builds.
---
If u manage to get the right gear and visual advantage (hiding, camo etc) you will always win, execpt you find someone to group up with. Survival is still a team game.
---
If you're on PS4, we can team up sometime, and I'll share my power user perk so it will cost you less mats to build. I can also kick some in if you need. GT: Jay_31_
---
My current problem is that i have 24/25legendaries and i cant find any in 3 fucking hours.
---
Yep trading with a little, "kill stuff" in between. Lol
---
Trade for hunters long coat? 
---
Yep thats bad, had one myself... took down power plant( first had to get rid of some low level whom thought he could beat me) , then defended it for 2 times.... after that installed all the resource generators... then the server kicked me....
---
I can't think of a more important addition to this game. 
---
As the gentleman above me pointed out. Scrapper perk and WT runs nets you about 100 plastic per run.  I use less than 75 shells per run so it’s a shell farm.  I also save the ARs they drop for selling.  They drop gun powder as well.  Honestly it’s a one stop shop.  All you need is lead from an outside source. You almost never have to leave WT.  I keep my camp on the junk pile right outside as well.
---
Since they updated workshop to make it clear thoses are for PVP, i even stopped looting them. Also, i created a new character while waiting for player vending and i stay out of workshop area. It makes it harder to unlock plans.
---
The newest "thing" is armor wise would be the  Bloodied weapons ( Does more damage the lower your health. ) \\  Bolstering Armor  ( Grants up to 35 Damage and Energy Resistance, the lower your health )  and then you just rad yourself to 20% health or something like that, just google it, there are builds everywhere -  but basically you may see a person with 20% health but try doing damage to them, its like they are made out of Teflon. 
---
Thatd be awesome, I still need alot, a guy did just give me a ton of black titanium, I still need more of it and more of everything else, I could play rn, I'm on
---
*Lights are dimmin’!*
---
Seems to be, yet they are always chillin' while in a state of constant offence. Anyway, his latest video looks fun, restoring an old Gateway PC :)
---
If they removed syringer I'm thinking you're correct-don't see how this is so persistent if it's not intentional but I'm also no game designer so my opinion means jack 
---
If you have any caps don’t even risk it
---
Or caps.?
---
+karma. Great transaction, fast and accurate. Hope to do business again.
---
My GT: xxfatman654xx 
---
This is why I refuse to play it.   I could only play it if Bethesda got serious about getting rid of all duped gear. 
---
Yeah yeah go ahead and down vote me and tell me how you acquired your TSE honestly (by buying it from someone who was obviously a duper).
---
Why am I so confident that it's from duping?  Consider.
---
In hundreds of hours of play, and as many dead legendary enemies, I have had only  one TSE weapon drop from an enemy : a two- shot explosive Cryolator.   So yeah I know that TSE does drop. 
---
But I have never seen anyone with a two shot explosive cryolator.  Or a two shot explosive Gatling laser. Oh I'm sure they exist. 
---
But 95 percent of the TSE weapons I see are shot guns and hand made.  
---
Why does damn near everyone running with the TSE effect seem to have it on the same damn weapons?  Why don't I see more TSE gatling plasma? Or TSE broad sider?  Or TSE ultracite laser rifle? 
---
Is it because TSE shot guns and hand made  are just really common compared to all others?  I seriously doubt it. 
---
It's the mothman it is speed to stalk you most the game
---
Have you tried server hopping? If that's not working you may need to start a quest to get the key. Also if you server hop don't pick up anything. It will triger a wait clock and keys wont spawn for like a week.
---
I made a post on the OG forums that might be helpful :  
---
Its a text blog, sorry, but its what I found after like 18 hours in survival:  
---
 [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/331876/survival-mode-a-guide-for-carebears?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/331876/survival-mode-a-guide-for-carebears?language%5B%5D=en) 
---
Has to be the bloodied explosive gatling laser that dropped the night before they removed explosive energy weapons from the game. My first explosive, at level 145, and the next day they make it a legacy.
---
I had one today.  I think I found the cause while trying to get it working again.  I'm on Windows 10 Pro Version 1809 and the process was suspended by the UWP process group.  My theory is that they changed something in the last patch or two and it's letting Windows suspend the process hence the crashes and disconnects.
---
i havent noticed any difference whatsoever so it might be bugged, leveling up is just as slow if not slower in survival with the restricted fast traveling and everything
---
Oh I didn't know about that . I've read it stopped at 50 for the special attributes I didn't realize it was also about the players power.  
---
Yes, definitly, I can't wait to try it with a decent team.
---
I haven't had a problem with people trying to kill me? I'm playing the main storyline right now and I haven't seen a single soul.
---
In order to benefit from the XP boost you need to game it. If you just make a new character and level I feel the restricted spawn points could end up negating the xp bonus. If you are trying to benefit from the bonus XP, I'd set your camp up near a good farming location and just do farming runs.
---
Yeah, I got one the other day that I had to defend my claimed shop from and attack.  I get there and it says defeat sheepsquatch horde 1. It was 5 invader bots.
---
This doesn't add up. If you have stuff you are selling via player vending, it would be back at your base and not on your character... meaning the weight perk cards wouldnt apply.
---
Next, player builds would not be homogeneous if you made weight perks a separate system from other perks. You would actually open builds by allowing people to slot more game effecting things like stealth cards, charisma cards (which would be a huge boon to team play), etc. You would still see different builds for playstyles like melee, pistols, rifles, shotguns, etc.
---
I'm not advocating for people being able to 'do everything'. I'm advocating for not making making how much you can carry such a massive part of your character build. It's not compelling.
---
Further, when it comes to the weight card themselves, you would see variance depending on what kind of builds people use for combat (ballistic ammo, melee weapons, armor, pharmacy, food, energy ammo, heavy guns, explosives). People would put on things that they actually use and complemented their build... just like they do now. The difference is you are sacrificing gameplay for annoyance removal instead. 
---
I'm guessing it's tied to when the character who dropped those items logs off.  Probably a few minutes after, anything they dropped vanishes.
---
Is that what it is?  Yeah, annoying popping up the map and and the same guys with 2+ hours of Survival don't show anywhere on the map
---
Well be safe
---
Learn to use fire proof and dense mod
---
I’ve been on an hour at overseers trading. 
---
He was asking for some one to play with 
---
&gt; CAMPS were originally not a part of the game; workshops where the only build areas, like settlements in FO4. 
---
Thank god they scrapped this idea, tbh.
---
Any idea on how to level up a little easier? I know some people will say "PlAy ThE gAmE" but I have already I've gotten characters to 100+ but it took forever. I know the story etc. 
---
Any good spots to farm?
---
People would need to use Power Armor for that to happen. And I haven't fought a single PA user yet.
---
Yeah I'm an atheist I just thought it was a nice thing to say
---
Ultracite 
---
 find are basically anti scorched /scorchbeast weapons so they do less against regular enemys
---
Thanks for the tip 👍
---
Two nights ago I was on doing this same thing and I went to Watoga midway through my circuit and I got the weirdest streak of Legendary bots in Watoga I've ever had. Not a single 3 star to be found, but EVERY protectron was a 1 star level 38 or 50.  I just kept going in a circle around the city streets triggering the bot spawn things and I got about 50 legendary items (mostly useless but two whole sets of top level bolstering and unyielding which I want to try out). People kept fast traveling in to the station and going down to the nuke zone but nobody else was going around the town, but every time someone came in more bots would spawn.
---
The ***really*** interesting thing though was that after about an hour of this all of the normal non hostile (I was the mayor) Watoga bots stopped spawning completely and all the pods started spawning only **hostile** high level Major/Colonel Gusty's all around the town. At first I thought maybe someone was doing Mayor For A Day but there was no scorchbeast flying around and no gunfire coming from that rooftop and I've never seen them spawn all over town like that before.
---
I almost felt like maybe someone was controlling the server and did the whole thing as a kind of joke.
---
I took a screen shot with a pile of dead Gutsy's around in the middle of town but it's on my other PC, I'll post a link up later.
---
Its Beta so u gotta expect people to jump on whichever "push button to win mode" they can find before they can balance it.
---
On newer characters it's tough because you can't really get to the great spots. I was trying to find good areas with lots of scorched. So areas with a bunch of abandoned farms/houses with large amounts of spawns are nice. Maybe that old theme park to the north west?
---
Explosive Flamethrower, I very rarely use it - but when I do, it explodes my mind.
---
Ok thanks, do you know where I should start the quest to get this key?
---
&gt; we saw in the trailer are dungeons, and are an Arktos Lab of some kind.
---
I'm really hoping that there is a bit of a "lobby" before the dungeon, when someone arrives it sends a message like the hunter/hunted radio station, and other people will then know to join.
---
Yeah, just let me stay in the loading screen for an hour.
---
Offer..?
---
This works both ways though, I've got a level 10 survival only character at the moment and I adore it when level 200+'s pick fights with me
---
I lose 20-50 caps on death, but gain 400 per kill
---
If the effects on legendaries were turned off I feel it'd be a much more even playing ground, regardless of level (anything after 50 literally doesn't matter anyway)
---
I posted about this separately, I think they broke loot respawn on the last patch.
---
Same with music in the main menu. Allow us to lower music volume in settings?
---
Idea: add factions. 
---
This could be an easy way to improve survival. Make karma requirements for each faction. For instance, no positive karma allowed in raider factions. It encourages team based PvP, and even faction wars. And please have each raised faction different. They didn't always work well together. 
---
Also, instead of just positive and negative karma, maybe make an alignment type chart, and you can only be one off for each faction (ie, a lawful good can't be in the free States since they are clearly chaotic. The only problem is defining the difference between lawful and chaotic in a wasteland with no government. 
---
1000
---
I already jumped in 5 times, but it's just outa my reach.
---
Sounds like you've done the whole lone warrior badass thing. Build the ultimate support character. Be the backbone of a queen killing team. Vats crit medic build.
---
That video sounds spectacular, would you mind posting the link?
---
Depends on if ur buffing Xp bonues like Inspiration, cranberry food etc. then of course its faster as long as ur not getting spanked while not focusing on the pvp players stalking and killing u.
---
Yes. You can. They kill you, you *log off*. Unless you happen to load onto the same server when you come back (it's happened to me, once), you no longer own the thing. And because you had to spawn at a FT point, you lose nothing but the time it took to log off and back on.
---
Bag of spoiled meat. That’s the closest we get
---
I agree I just gather caps from vendor runs and buy stuff from other people
---
Build persistence is a BIG deal for me (just personal feeling).  Honestly I just want to build everywhere and then let the creep mobs and other players sort it out.  Spend resources, make stuff x everybody else doing the same.  Have creep spawns everywhere that are sensitive to building resource value/type in X diameter around the spawn points.  Have it be a continuous struggle against the wasteland to build, maintain, and shape the player created landscape.   You can work on personal settlements or with groups building up and defending big towns.  If you ignore and improperly defend, the wasteland reclaims the wasteland from you.  It's simple...but alive...which is the important part to me.  The online world does not feel alive and doesn't have any persistence of personal actions beyond a very limited scope.  We are the settlers, but we're not really achieving anything.  Persistent camps will go a long way towards a living, shapeable world.  It's a great step in the right direction.  I guess I've just always seen a much grander concept since the initial marketing of FO76 as an online game.
---
That sux 
---
This is an unacceptable bug generally but it seems really unnecessary on PC because despite having an entire keyboard of buttons the game sticks to only 3 or 4 for pretty much everything other than moving. The jump button should not have to share with the "attach wire" button.
---
Wastelanders are NPCs, wii :D
---
I went from rank 4 to 22 in one day on my new character. With the 20% extra, 5% from sleeping and 5% from cranberry cobbler is super fast to level up.
---
Not sure on the weapon part, but can confirm it works at V76 for a good 10-20 seconds as long as YOU DONT TAKE A SINGLE STEP
---
If you move, game says it's gotime
---
I think it's the security squad, if a tot of bots are killed it will spawn those high level Gutsies. To avoid a too easy exp farming, i think.
---
Bonus point, sometimes those Gutsies can be legendary.
---
Well I got it all moved this opening up that spawn.  Thanks for the tip.  I am myself interested in those civil war plans.
---
I guess when people say they don't know how to get into the game, what exactly were you doing in the other fallouts? Even if there were NPCs everywhere, you still end up going on missions solo and learning about the world through notes and holotapes. A lot of the robots have personality, and there are clear objectives and a storyline. I like how the stories of the dead have more impact because there isn't a world already in place when you get out of the vault. You also run into situations where you see an actual character being played by a human being hauling ass past you being chased by a swarm of enemies and you get to jump in and feel like you actually impacted something in the game. The point of this is to continually build and get better. It's a living game that will grow and change. They will fuck up and they will do some really amazing things. Maybe I am not picky enough or too much of a fan. If you honestly find after revisiting the game that you still don't like it, I don't see what is wrong with that. There are options and there are communities as great as this one has been. It's gaming. If it's not fun, then fuck it and move on. Nothing but options. We're a lot luckier now in that regard. 
---
Why is the Pump Action Shotgun locked in a 1500 atom bundle? And limited time only? 
---
Strange ever since I stashed bloodied And anti armor in my stash I’ve been seeing more of it, while before I wasn’t stashing anything at all, and my normal rates where other things that aren’t useful for anybody
---
I wonder why this post is being downvoted. A fight club seems a swell idea!
---
Oh the memories 
---
It’s be nice if guns scaled with the players level instead of level limiting weapons. Of course capping the weapon stats at 50. Sucks having to find new weapons every 5 levels while leveling.
---
Hey it’s their opinion I don’t care you interested 
---
I love you and your thoughts
---
The mysterious Riddler? Love the idea 
---
Ok, I’ll part with it for that 
---
I am working on a heavy auto weapon build on an alt, and despite not having any of the damage boost or other cards that match them, it's been working out well. I just use something that runs off 5mm or .50, which is not too bad to make.  That and I farm the Big Bend Tunnel for items to junk for steel.
---
Ok, I’ll part with it for that
---
Before the changes to workshops I would grab 4 or 5  and keep on running defense missions.  Now that survival mode is here you may br able to get away with doing it in adventure mode.
---
4. Could end up in a huge mess or in a huge point.
---
I'm already hoarding a lot of 2-star legendaries so I can trade them in when the Legendary Vendor finally comes. Can't wait to see how it works.
---
This needs more attention. Serving hopping ruined it. If you find a server thats non-stop dropping legenadries, do the same tracking.
---
Probably close to an hour. It is not very good. You end up often using more ammo to defend the place than it produces. Complete the excavator power armor quest, move down to the Ash Heap, and enjoy the bounty Hornwright Site 3 has to offer!
---
Camps don't really *need* to be permanent. What should be permanent- until takeover, is Workshop ownership. Even when u logout. 
---
If no one successfully captures it then your name should still be set as owner until you log back in thru an owned workshops menu of some sort. Because the way it is now is tedious and immersion breaking. And a way to make sure that you don't get a full world maybe your slot in the world Is held as long as you own capital too
---
Really doubling down on Survival, huh? If this is the direction the game is going, I'll be moving on. The game still has fundamental issues, and they are spending so much time on this. Doesn't sit right.
---
Will be on later tonight gt. Celticcrossbone
---
I feeling the love too, I falling in love with all these new players in survival mode but when i chase after them with my flaming chainsaw.. i am sad that after they riddle my body with bullets and take my 10-15 caps or whatever pocket lint I am carrying they leave me. Leave me out in the rain alone. :(
---
I don't have any jobs for him, I SWEAR \**as I'm getting beat to death with a job sign*\*
---
Thats what survival should be. 
---
You're trucking across the wastelnd when... *BOOM! Headshot!*
---
...
---
PA Speaker: "Good morning vault dwellers, this is the overseer..."
---
I think it's random. I've been grinding Westek in Survival and I have 14 luck (up to low 20s with some Unyielding armor). A few runs I would get no legendaries, others I would see 0-star legendaries that don't count for the weekly.
---
I think it's just random and not based on SPECIAL luck.
---
This is great 2 thumbs up... I may or may not be stealing this idea...  😁
---
Ok, just working on a faction video for an XB1 friend but will msg you shortly - thanks 
---
Or toxic goo. Fertilizer. 
---
Dude, look at the date on this thread.  I haven't even played the game in months.  I don't know why I'm still getting notifications for this but it is how it was AT THE TIME.
---
You just changed my Appalachian wasteland life!  I had no idea scrapper could lead to plastic.  My boom stick will be happy. 
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/dead-bruce-campbell-6P4MxhAHKJO2A
---
I missed the jarringly loud noise from the Skyrim menu. Glad they brought it back.
---
They are just south of the power plant at monongah 
---
Agree. People been using exploit to build their CAMP inside a house, the only way in is to sit on a chair and when you do that the owner is waiting inside to kill you on sight.
---
People been building their house with concrete walls, the only way to kill them is by nuke.
---
Spending caps and put bounty on someone? You're just wasting your caps because in a team group, friends will clear bounty from each other and share the bounty caps. So it's like you're giving caps to them for free lol
---
Glad you enjoy it! 
---
Awh little buddy! If you chased after me with a flaming chainsaw I'd at least stick around for a chat
---
Spawn Camps will get balanced by a spawn-in immune period I'd guess or survival will only maintain a limited player base.
---
The funny part is that their in game currency is almost worthless.  Every once in a while I can get a sweet item with caps but it's pretty rare. 
---
I might be interested.
---
Plenty of room underneath for planting and water I'm guessing?
---
Tonnes and one of them even has an acid resource 
---
True lol, so is there anyplace else that you recommend for an aluminum/steel farm? I can just craft 5.56 ammo then :3
---
Bro its man vs machine. these robot sympathizers need to get the message.... even if we have to beat it into them. 
---
I like how it places me on same fucking server 10times trying to change server. Now it is 4 hours i havent met legendary with star. Last one i need for challenge. This game is fucking trash. Before they started implementing stupidities, it had potential, but what the hell is this?
---
If camps persist after I log out does that mean that people can destroy it while I’m gone? Does that also mean I’ll be stuck in the same server with other people and if there’s a jerk I cannot just change servers like I do now?
---
Well rested perk at all times is an easy to boost
---
Nice.. again thank you for sharing that
---
If you take Todd Howard at his word anymore that problem is on you. 
---
I doubt even a quarter of the sensationalist BS he’s peddling about this game is true. Just like when it was announced and every lie thereafter. 
---
Watch those quests and wastelanders be more typical bethesda lies and disappointments. Downvote me IDGAF. 
---
Same here but then the second attempt got me 1 random location 
---
Not only that; it also would have made the game a lot more boring.
---
No problem I wish I could think of a good idea for my house because my house is just straight up from a YouTube tutorial 😂
---
Yeah just avoid the pvp wars at the stations, and be aware when you are in the top 3. Follow those two rules and it’s really not that bad. 
---
Yup, Wulf is dead on.  
---
Question, how quickly does your dick shrivel up when your bloodied build sees a barrage of gamma gun fire?
---
Follow up, how quickly does your dick shrivel up when you fail to one shot people at full health due to one shot protection and die yourself in one shot due to a critical hit and your low maximum health pool?
---
If you happen to come across one with a water source close by let me know so I can have my industrial water purifiers😎
---
Probably 5k upwards easily 
---
Yeah will do think I may find a cool place to put a new base for me 
---
While on a team. 
---
Or, you could try not to be a brayinjg jackass. 
---
I have glasses. 
---
Alright thats good to know.
---
Perhaps one day we will meet share chasing people with chainsaw stories.
---
One thing I liked about that game when I played.
---
I have a pretty good spot across from for defiance in the woods but I need more planting room now for making my liquer
---
Oh my. If they pull that off, it will be insane
---
I did, and I love it! It has forced me to completely change my play style. No longer do I carry massive amounts of caps, aid or junk on me. Now I only carry one or two stimpaks, a couple of water and a few caps. I kill or gather food as needed, and spend my caps on other aid items that immediately get stored in my stash. 
---
It’s really knocked me out of my comfort zone, and I’m having a blast!!
---
I know a good place beside the big bridge 
---
I'd bet people would even pay 10k plus tbh
---
Alrighty
---
My theory is because V76 is its own instance, you need to at least be out of the original vault before choosing survival
---
The sarcasm in this post is just...perfect.
---
Idk how they are going to do camp persistence if we are logging in to new servers every time we log in. I suppose  a copy of your camp could just become part of a server until someone else logs in at that spot, but man then world would be littered with camps then.
---
... and they better not make us log in to the same server every time.
---
Ah okay, yeah the berry mentats are crucial in survival, the effect looks different on my screen tho for some reason (more of an outline). 
---
How do you like Long Shot vs Concentrated Fire? Is the additional range noticeable?
---
It’s so much fun haha 
---
Well they are allowing player named weapons so hopefully that helps 
---
Pretty bad eyes myself. I can do a lot of the game just fine, but reading and trying to find crap on the ground is a real struggle. 
---
At the very least, they could let us turn off grass right? I know that's been a thing since Oblivion and I've always done it just so I could see. 
---
You didn’t. I started a new one the other day just for survival, and had to log out after leaving the vault to log back into survival. 
---
And I don’t think you should be forced to start a new character, but I personally like the idea of doing it!
---
Hi, I have a few questions about some lingering concerns.
---
General:
---
* Can we remove the visual effect of falling slowly from Bird Bones? When combined with Marsupial, it tends to lag and makes it very hard to hit players
---
* Are stealth boys fair as is? Would it make sense to slow player movement speed while invisible? Perhaps stagger effects should knock players out of stealth, at least temporarily?
---
   * Why does grape Mentats also cause invisible players to glow, albeit not as brightly as berry Mentats?
---
* Can we have the option to bulk ammo for resale? It would make pricing easier between players too.
---
Survival:
---
* Does it make sense to have a grace period after events finish, so a deathmatch does not instantly ensue? Why not let players leave the area if they'd prefer not to risk their junk and aid?
---
* Does it make sense that players can camp out and instantly kill those that spawn at train stations? Should the camper become Wanted for doing so, or the player who spawned be given a brief period of invincibility, as if they fast traveled there?
---
* Does it make sense that team-mates can collect each other's bounty, then trade it back to them?
---
* Why is there no delay after dying before you can re-spawn on a team-mate? Team-based PvP encounters become wars of attrition.
---
* If we are so limited in where we can fast travel, would it be reasonable to increase the frequency of events, to which people can travel?
---
Miscellaneous:
---
* Assassin's sentinel/cavalier armor reduces damage taken from other players by 85% while standing still or sprinting, respectively. How do you balance weapons for PvP with that kind of damage reduction in the game?
---
* Why are players who aim without VATS penalized by not being able to execute critical hits? If it takes more skill to play that way, is the current VATS-only critical hit system fair to them?
---
Outside of PA, probably unyielding.
---
Is your friend selling it?
---
The farmhands at Vault-Tec’s Ag center are a solid, quick run for steel, aluminum and lead.
---
Watoga, also.

---
I’m waiting for the medical malpractice to come out. Thing is sweet.
---
I got a Bloodied The Dragon last weekend. I haven't had a chance to try it out yet though. 
---
You can adjust sound effects. 
---
Also, it looks odd, but you could try inverting the colors. 
---
Ah, alrighty! So not bolstering?
---
Also, what’s within power armor?
---
I firmly believe that it should have been a requirement that a new character is created for Pvp mode. Would have evened the playing field. 
---
good 44 legendarys hard to find so this is blessing.. would be nicer if it were damage based and not a support weapon.. even tho my toon is a support type lol.
---
I enjoy it for what it is but no NPCs and factions or branching quest lines/answers betrays everything the original fallout stands for. I saw a really great fallout isn’t fallout video on YouTube and the man correctly predicted that after fallout 4 that the game was going to fully become a shooting exploration game very soon and low and behold 76 came out 4 years later. 
---
If you like a game where you can walk around, explore, build a nice little house but have to kill the same enemies with the same shitty AI over and over with no towns and people to break the monotony then this game can be fun and relaxing. I enjoy it for what it is. But this isn’t what I feel traditional fallout fans want or need. 
---
To me it’s objectively impossible that there isnt one single sentient anthropomorphic NPC in the whole state of West Virginia besides human players from vault 76 and grahm. There should be a ghoul city or synths or something.  
---
Every time I drink one of those i half expect/wish to wake up in the middle of a Trevor Phillips shenanigan 😂
---
I don't think armor effects work while in PA. Bloodied means you want minimal health and Unyielding adds +3 to a bunch of special skills when at low health, and it stacks.
---
Also that it isn't just people with disability level vision, it's just horrible kerning and even worse choice of "paper" they're written on. I'm looking at a 46in TV and even I have to squint, as well as read them slow, to make sense of them.
---
RNG! If she stays on ground, 12-15 minutes easy. If she stays aerial, 30-45 min if you’re lucky. 
---
I’m starting to think the fight is just RNG. 
---
Yeah but If you spec into luck and get the crit perks you will never run out of boosted damage crits and will be healing you and your team at the same time
---
You mustn't be on xbox ha
---
I don't know about aluminum, but the place I listed has tons of lead and iron deposits. All you need is acid to break it down in to lead and steel scrap. Hemlock holes is the best acid workshop for that.
---
I estimate 400 lead and 1000 steel scrap per day from mining that one spot.
---
I totally misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were calling how long the fight would last. Lol. My bad. 
---
You mean that's not supposed to happen?  Lol, it happens to me every time.
---
Just launch nobody in server :-/
---
Get some better glasses then, don’t try and blame your poor eyesight on the game
---
Agree, it's beta with issues. But him talking about reporting players in pvp will have the world laughing at him. Spawn killing can sucks so I just don't spawn at stations. You can holster your weapon and travel to vault 76, there you will be invulnerable for about 20 secounds or until you start fighting. Don't mean people won't chase you down while counting. This mode isn't for everyone sadly and it dose have serious issues at this time.
---
I knocked him down briefly with a sneak-critical when my Gun Fu auto-targeted him in the middle of a gun fight. He got up after maybe 5 seconds and he didn’t pay me any mind. He just went ham on a couple of scorched nerds and went about his business.
---
, ; . -   
---
I’d join. 
---
I'd suggest it if you're level is over 100. You don't wanna lose all those caps everytime you die
---
Considering the amount of feral ghouls that are dressed in what looks like a Scout uniform... they didn’t seem very prepared for this brave new world...
---
Well I wanted fallout 5, was warned by a journalist it was some sort of mp so that softened the blow but it did not soften the blow that it had pvp. Eventually I got over it probably cause I’m a sucker for all things fallout and honestly their West Virginia setting looked really awesome and I wanted to explore it. Loving the game and deciding one huge benefit of mp is that they keep adding more stuff to do the game and it may take a long time to get an sp fallout game but this one will give me new fallout stuff to play for a while.
---
Had us in the first half &gt;.&gt; Not gonna lie.
---
 Sounds very fun though.
---
Odds of NPCs actually getting added? Slim. I hope they do, cause seriously, I've been playing a good bit the last few days, and it is just plain BORING.
---
It's like all the interesting stuff happened to the dead people you find. Take the Mistress of Mysteries quest, for example. THAT would have been GREAT to be hot and heavy in the middle of. As is, it was "Oh, I bet this is what happens." And I was right.
---
But yeah, you're right--they'll need to do something about griefers during NPC dialogue. Hell, even with survival mode, I still get the super-high-level jackasses that show up just to kill me--didn't even bother to take over my workshop, just showed up to kill me and my teammate, interrupt our defense of the workshop, and stayed there--not taking over the workshop, not contesting it, just showed up, killed us, and sat there waiting on us to respawn to kill us again.
---
Kinda bullshit, that.
---
At least you can take joy in knowing that someone probably inherited your hard work. 
---
You think people don’t now ... wait for a couple weeks after guaranteed drops when there’s zero gain to be had.
---
No, PC :(
---
Overall better then 5/10 so it was worth. 
---
And they just patched that area as well :(
---
I'd like them to make bash/grenade two separate buttons while they're at it.  Makes no sense to me to have bash and grenade be on the same key.
---
I’d argue fallout 4 was honestly better. Of course same engine but not having to do mp. But yeah, 76 runs better than new Vegas. And NV is my favorite game of all time. But it eventually got so bad over time I couldn’t even finish it (I think old world blues caused it to get that bad. I heard that dlc can really make the performance worse even after you finish it and I did notice that with my game. Pity cause old world blues is my favorite  dlc for fallout). 
---
PS4  I keep getting wasted by 2shot explosive. Anything to keep up with really. I'd rather go up against higher level than the lower levels
---
What does quad mean? Like 4 barrels?
---
I'm lvl 20 so I'm still learning but I'm trying a shotgun build
---
I've tried this and found the drawbacks are:  
---
 \- ALL deaths drop aid items, not just PvP deaths. So die to a deathclaw and drop half your aid.
---
 \- The fast travel limitations are a bitch to work with if you just want to adventure in survival mode
---
 \- The ticker and sound for PvP kills can get really irritating as the state of PvP seems to be frantic
---
All up, though Survival should offer a game play option of high risk adventure, playing it that way isn't much fun.  
---
Have you seen the wastelanders update on the roadmap? Most people are placing their money on that adding npcs
---
I’m sorta a noob, but right now I kinda like that camps don’t persist. I can’t say I’ll understand how the new system will work though
---
I'm glad I'm not alone in this. It crashes so hard that my task manager (set to always be on top) don't even display. 
---
Only thing to do is either hard reset or wait and hope your swiss army knife has a phi--sorry, wrong thread.
---
Too many!
---
1. All Rise Super Sledge for when I run out of ammo/don't want to waste it or just have mobs too close to me.
---
2. Perfect Storm (10mm SMG) for tagging legendary mobs. (Mobs are on fire so you know you've done it.)
---
3. AAE Handmade for killing everything at long range.
---
4. Mutant Explosive Tesla Shotgun for medium range.
---
5. Double Barrel Shotgun with Faster Run speed while aiming to let me run around faster...although I'm not sure this is working with Speed Demon...need to test. Should try and find a lower weight version too...
---
6. Hunter's Explosive Combat Shotgun for killing animals? I really should get rid of this...but it was my first good weapon...
---
If I had to slim down, I would just choose the first 4...although I still am searching for the perfect SBQ weapon...
---
As some one whose favorite game and fallout is NV, I gotta wonder why anyone who likes NV would expect 76 to be anything like it. It’s made by Bethesda who tends to have different goals in their games than obsidian and it was an mo game which meant rpg was going to be even more limited if there at all (and that is what made NV special compared to the Bethesda fallouts, the good rpg with the Bethesda game engine). 
---
Can find used copys cheap, for consoles at least, it is what you make it. Quest are fun if you read notes listen to holotapes and get into the story
---
The game is similar but still different, it has a completely different feel but still draws some parallels from fallout 4 like the gunplay and the building mechanics in some ways.
---
If you actively seek out the other players you can find them but when you're just roaming around you won't run into them constantly but when you do most won't shoot on site but offer a trade to help you along if you're a low level (atleast that's what's happened to me and my mates so we pay it forward)
---
The quests can get repetitive but the main quest is fun. However I do strongly recommend playing with your friends to make things more interesting and keep things lighthearted and overall fun while walking through the wasteland instead of doing it by yourself. The events that happen do get repetitive but they can drop ypu some loot that will help you out if you need stimpaks or a weapon that does slightly better than the one you have already.
---
I'd say personally that you should jump into it with a whole bunch of friends because you won't have many people who bully you at a low level and if it does happen some higher level may come in to protected you until the attacker gets bored. Overall its a good game and is paving a way for future expansion and a bunch more missions so it's best to jump in early 
---
Well come check it out if you don’t like it you can leave at any time 
---
Looking at the "new quests" tab of it, I can kind of see that--but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I don't mind the leader board so much. I started a new character and luckily found plans for nuke mines very very early. My tactic has been to wait to hit top 3, buy out my caps, drop my junk and aid and then drop a shit load of them nuke mines and just wait! The amount of swearing I've heard over mics has made it all worthwhile!
---
Beyond that I would be happy with a change so that it's either top kills or an area of search rather than an exact location! 
---
Hi Kaz I’m on now
---
Legit 80% of my time playing (solo) I feel like I'm just playing F4. Which to me isn't a bad thing, I just finished the F4 dlc before playing 76. Running into random people is rare but that depends where you are. 
---
Oh and every person I've ran into has been nice or atleast not aggressive. There's really no reason to pvp especially if you're low level.
---
You’re finally awake!
---
It's not.
---
Literally the moment they posted the road map I started saving legendary items, and farming them almost daily. After seeing this announcement I finally took an inventory.
---
Weapons: 179 \*, 40 \*\*, 21 \*\*\*
---
Armor: 108 \*, 33 \*\*, 28 \*\*\*
---
I haven't checked since the Fasnacht event ended but it was definitely blocked then. Not surprised if they kept it that way lol
---
I have perfect eyesight, and I can't read those things either.
---
Love the game, please make it better everyday !
---
Spawn campers are honestly some of the worst people, and they feed off your rage and frustration too.  
---
The only way to deal with them is report them for harrasment and move on.  Don't yell at them, don't even talk to them, and don't keep trying to spawn in.  If they are at your camp, don't engage and move your camp elsewhere. 
---
Its hard, and I made some mistakes dealing with them because they get you worked up, which is what they want.  Just ignore them and they get bored if they can't feed off your emotions. 
---
The ability to form group settlements to make little towns around the map, and player vending from the start. Still no NPCs though, wouldn’t add much 
---
What's dense mod? If u don't mind me asking :) 
---
My doorbell takes shotgun shells.
---
Thanks, I use fireproof with sentinal and caviler armor, doesn't seem to work too well when have three dudes bearing down on you with TSE. Last about half a second. 
---
If you are PC, find me in game as greppson!

Backpacks sooner 😂
---
Earn legendary effects my be able to build my own legendary. This of course will also bring about a legendary rebalancing to fix some of the more over the top combinations.
---
I can build a fusion-powered generator.  I can even build a reactor so small that it fits on a powered suit of armor.  Nuclear weapons?  Got it.  I can craft auto-injectors that can essentially regrow mangled limbs.  What I can't seem to figure out, though, is how to make plastic from oil or corn.  Crazy isn't it?
---
You have been banned from club penguin
---
You miss 90% of the shots you don’t take. I assume some go in on accident or you can take credit for others work. 
---
Ability to safe switch belongings from one character to another. Without the difficulties that are currently overcome, by a difficult system. 
---
I’ll take them off your hands. Legendary vendor is coming soon you know.
---
I've seen more than a few people dumping unwanted legendaries in the ice machine outside the country club at the golf course.
---
Would have made white springs the defacto hub with safe space, vendors, and all crafting in one location.
---
Same. PC. Been aggravating me all day.
---
Would love if this meant fishing would be implemented but I'm quite doubtful :(
---
I personally was just super happy to see anything fallout as I expected the next one after fo4 to be after TE6 which was a long way off, and me not being an elder scrolls fan meant I had probably 8 years until i got another installment of fallout, so to get fo76 was a godsent really, I had also always wanted a multiplayer fallout game
---
Thanks I'll have a look.
---
I agree with everything but the TSE. I know for a fact that no TSE in existence still one shots people with any kind of armor. You must be confusing it with the bloooldied explosive weapons. I cant believe the TSE hate train is still going.
---
I mean, you could probably make one. Remember that they have single tone speakers and delayed switches in the game. I imagine it would be easy enough to rig up.
---
It’s like the games that tell you to go outside for a bit. It’s not a bug. It’s a feature. 
---
&gt;Hmm?
---
Powervert!
---
Without the pressure of the "longest to survive" timer, the snipers and ninjas would never be found, and the map would feel more sparse than it already is.
---
I like the mode, except for the sentinels. It's super deflating when I ambush a player and stick him in the back with a knife three or four times only for him to slowly turn and merc me. Sentinel = skill less in my book, an unAmerican Redcoat coward's way to play. But.. I've been equally disappointed in the TSE players and they've persisted. Here's hoping BL3 comes out soon
---
Which is what a Fan is
---
Thanks!! 
---
Link please ? I am braindead and can't even tie my shoes. Please have mercy !
---
I actually have one shot explosive handmade that I found legit. But it doesn't hold up to being fired at by three people with TSE's
---
Yup I guess they did the best they could to get rid of them, if they couldn't trace each item back to a source.  But if so, then they should have required new characters for Survival and isolated those servers so items can't be passed back and forward.  Guess we'd find out if people are still duping then..
---
There was a time when the first concept equated to the second
---
Ha Ha Ha!
---
If you store something and place it again, it will be at full health. 
---
Dont let the reviews scare you. Most are written by people who look for the worst in everything. It had some major flaws but it has cleaned up quite abit, and is great fun. Adventure mode as it's called now is pretty laid back. Very, very rarely do I find anyone would wants to attack me. Now is the perfect time to join, you missed one time limited event, but the dlc is just about to take off for the summer. Come join the fun!
---
That challenge is just flavor to play on "76", no one is expecting you to leave your game open for 7600 hours. Most, if not the entire rest, of the others are totally reasonable.
---
Yep.  Another #Bethesda giant mistake.
---
I see them at Appalachian antiques pretty often
---
I usually go to the giant teapot and do that event. It doesn't doesn't spawn ants, but I'd say it does about 90% of the time.
---
So if a raider murdered you in your full X-01, you would expect him to give it to your next of kin?
---
The magazine size is 4x as large as normal, so it would normally be 8, mine was 32 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
I 100% agree
---
I wear unyielding BOS combat and do not PVP. But apparently I'm a griefer now because what I wear.
---
Not sure if I have anything I want to get rid of, but might wanna let everyone know the system you're on.
---
Gonna be honest, have no idea where that is.
---
Good idea! Thanks!
---
Somewhat unrelated, but "moth to a flame" sounds like an epic mothman themed event. I can imagine some glowing pile of loot (conveniently lit up by a spotlight or something), and players on the server need to get there before the mothman gets there and steals it all. Maybe we could slow the mothman down by fighting it/setting up distractions. 
---
Power substation just north of watoga, fighting a deathclaw
---
Re-read his point of view
---
Yeah I only raised this question because I read more than one story about people starting a new survival character and them talking about what happened the minute they stepped out of the vault, as if they were in that mode when they left. 
---
Bought lever plan today at lewisville station.
---
And that is a stupid game mechanic. You’re forced to give up all your other workshops, all your junk, leave your friends, etc just because some asshole is abusing a broken feature. Why don’t we just fix the broken mechanic instead and simply allow the player to give up the workshop after they’re killed (if they wish to)?
---
Season mode and reroll legendaries? Sounds like FO76 is turning into Diablo 3. A good change in my opinion. I like it.
---
Challenging yourself will lead to overall improvements. Make a new character start fresh 
---
More Fun Facts: "Pompy" was the nickname given to Sacagawea's son (Jean Baptiste Charbonneau) by William Clark, famous pioneer scout and younger brother of George Rogers Clark, after whom Clarksburg was named.
---
I raid items from the world and mobs. I'm a raider just like every other hoarder.
---
&gt; I don’t care what you think and no one thinks you’re cool or edgy for trolling a legitimate game improvement suggestion thread 
---
Dont buy them then. I dont feel particular cool nor edgy, nor do I feel like I'm trolling you. I read through the entire wall of text you wrote, I think it's only fair that you read what *I* think. 
---
I've never once bought a single atom with real money and I have all the paints I want (nuka-cola, Blackbird,  camouflage,  excavator, tricentenial, etc). I've received every atom in game. I still have &gt; 4K. I play fairly casually. I've been playing since the beta and I'm around lvl 150 with almost 500 hrs in game, but I've not yet completed the mainline quests, though I probably will this weekend. I've still not visited all locations, marked or unmarked. 
---
With all that said, I really don't see the problem? If you squandered all your atoms on a bunch of stuff you dont use and now you dont have them to buy what you find cool, how is that the games issue and not yours? Either play more for free atoms or do without...or pay for them. It's not like it'll make your play any better or worse? The way you come off, fair or not, is as an entitled whiner."I spent all my atoms on silly stuff, now I cant get the cool stuff other people are getting". 
---
Beth has a lot of folks to support and as they are cranking out content, for free, and supporting said people by atom sales, I, personally, am good with it and with whatever they'd like to charge for extras. I much rather that then paid subscriptions or DLCs. Thanks for listening! 
---
1) do you have a fusion reactor? 2) are you near water? The crickets/flies can be really loud
---
But what if I'm wearing a raider outfit over my Bol/Sen/Assassin armor lol... 
---
They put those up, they might actually get me to spend money on the game (literally got the game free with a hardware bundle I was going to buy anyway)!
---
Bethesda wants to know your location 
---
well i guess for xp just whitespring but i dont go there myself at all because of the lag and overall i dont like it, if i want xp i only go to west tek but that’s not really an option for solo characters under level 50 cuz the mobs spawn level 46-68 there
---
i only have one character at level 180+ and my second character that i made for survival is still under 15 so i’m probably not the best to ask for advice, but whitespring and west tek are probably the best options and maybe events and workshops for getting started on brand new characters
---
Any chance you still have [this](https://i.imgur.com/0F38O9i.png?1)? I'd love to have it.
---
Bethesda?
---
Yes I have found explosive weapons myself- but without the two shot effect combined with it. That is uncommon but nearly as rare as TSE.
---
Have you tried turning your camp off and back on again?
---
I only have 1, what if plan doesn't drop?
---
PC player, this fixes it for us too, exit and renter build mode.
---
Sure. Also, I read today that they’re going to put a robot from each faction in the whitesprings hotel so that will mean less travel just to sell stuff. 
---
The funnest I’ve had is when my team of 4 and another team of 4 fought each other in watoga, neither team using ridiculously op weapons and it was actually really cool
---
I'm just hoping that next week's challenge isn't something like "Complete 10 Events in Survival".
---
Still have that available? I’m on PS4 and would like to buy that recipe 
---
Anytime you're ready I am.
---
The only way they can balance this is have people spawn in randomly around the train station and not a set location which people just sit invisible and aim at.
---
TSE has been dead for ages now. Bloodied rules. 
---
Moonshiner shack in nw bog. Not the greatest but I find them about every 3rd time. Also a short run to mac's farm which also sometimes has them.
---
Bunch o nerds
---
the vendors in the bog sometimes have some on sale
---
Thats called a Wanderer not a Raider. Raiders kill and grief for fun or sport, Raiders take from the innocent. They don't scavenge for food or materials, they kill and menace the people who do. You're not a Raider. There's no such thing as a good raider.
---
Thats a really cool fact! Nice one!
---
If they were to do that, they would have to do it in a way that if you're hiding in a safe zone, your time doesn't count toward your survival stats, because you're not surviving, just hiding and might as well be in adventure mode
---
I'm on Xbox or I'd help. I'd keep doing whitesprings runs, you'll eventually get something useful.
---
You still want to join my man
---
you dont even have to defend it, taking one already counts so you can quickly fast travel around and take one and the server hop so you dont have to defend them
---
Only get dinged if you take it off I say.
---
Oh I see. Yup that’s the guy. Killer base. 
---
Yes it does, and now me, an internet man has seen and you will forever feel that shame upon your body
---
That is a lot of crap you collected. For your sake I hope your time was not wasted. 
---
I do but its eh. I don't really have anything worth losing so its more about leveling in a dangerous environment, which is what I'm really enjoying about it.
---
Could there be matchmaking? That’s what I’m hoping for.
---
I only have 1 friend who plays
---
But why spend 3 perk points when you can ask for a nerf? (a joke)
---
I wonder what "raiding the fridge" or "raiding the medicine cabinet" means. Taking stuff is raiding, making the person doing so a "Raider".
---
I've been hopping back and forth between Westek and AWOL (and the odd Violent Night). I haven't seen a single other person try those events.
---
I don’t see how knowledge of the game is an unfair advantage 
---
It better now than it was before. That thing spammed attacks non stop at launch.
---
What bugs me is that they can be flying away from you and yet still firing it back at you. 
---
Bounties are extremely broken
---
Let's say a buddy and I are being dickwads and spawnkilling you for caps. You finally get sick of me and say "fuck it, 300 down on this dudes head"
---
Wellllll, at that point I would just leave the group I'm in, have a teammate kill me, et voila
---
You have lost your original caps on death, then the you've lost the bounty caps you just placed, then lost more caps cause you died again
---
I highly recommend staying tf away from bounty placing unless you're deliberately trying to throw caps away
---
How? I did it legit so you were proved wrong... are you ok?
---
I too would love a fishing mini game. Maybe a camp item like a dock or something. You can just sit down and while away time catching fish.
---
Use the concrete foundation and it up on the low areas tp where it evens out on the high areas
---
And move*
---
Why don’t you just ignore the camp system entirely like I do?
---
My camp is literally a stash box next to a place I like to farm fusion cores
---
To make sure I understand, if the combat armor has BOS paint, I can scrap to try and learn that paint "plan"? Head/limbs/chest?   Work today has broken my mind pretty good. 
---
I like the cut of your jib 😁
---
This game would have almost no appeal to me without it. Settlements were a big hit for me, so if they had restricted it to just workshops, I don't think I would have bought the game.
---
Do you have advanced power connections ?  There is a conduit piece you can apply through walls/floor and ceilings. You run a cable to the connector outside the wall, then make the connection inside. 
---
It’s weird, because after 4 everyone expected that the order was going to go Bethesda’s rumored new IP (Starfeild) and then ES6. 
---
We got a spin off fallout before either of those by complete surprise and yet people still expect it to be some full fledged mainline game and function as such, when if you look back the only spin off Fallout had that behaved exactly like a main title was New Vegas, the rest are just as deviant as 76 is from the usual formula. 
---
True, but the first defend mission happens like a minute after taking it. Saves some caps and time that way
---
Make a new one. The worst case scenario is it dies a bunch and you lose nothing.
---
This is where I found them
---
😧 you're not "raiding the fridge" thats called scavenging. Raiding is when you take from someone who already owns it aka killing someone for it or if it was possible, going into someone's camp and raiding their supplies. Me exploring Flatwoods scavenging for supplies is not a "raid"
---
I went to Watoga a few times, couldn't find anyone. I had a shootout with a guy at Whitesprings, was going quite well, until his mate sneaked up behind me and landed a hammer on my head. I need to find a team.
---
Apparently in the future there will be seasons in survival so you’ll need to make a new character every season or something like that
---
It does. 
---
Sorry got lost in cooking yeah I'm hopping on
---
From my experience it does seem to depend on overkill, or being struck again for the death blow.  
---
A player was wanted and they went to sleep in their camp. I came up, shot them a bit. They went down. ... I used a stim pack on them, and prepared to fast travel out. I found out that day they must fully die to get the bounty. Lol.  
---
Anyway. Shot them again with the same gun and they had the timer. Had to shoot em a few more times to finish the job. 
---
Another wanted player I took a much stronger gun and either they were really quick to give up, or the overkill dropped em flat. 
---
Doesnt give a concrete answer, but gives data to play with. Hope it helps some though! 
---
Such a great build but damn your house puts mine to shame. I wish I could build good. 
---
You are not banned, right?
---
You've proved my point: people aren't getting banned wrongfully.
---
Good talk. Have a nice day.
---
Im not sure, I think you get 95% VATS accuracy at a longer range and more consistently on moving targets.
---
I have 1* marine left leg
---
Probably not, but if we do it is likely to be with the wastelander dlc in the fall
---
I think a 1%xp boost per amount of time surviving is more likely than a cap bonus. Bethesda is currently trying to reduce the caps that are floating around because the built in cap sinks were circumvented by dupers.
---
Off for today, sorry. I will buy them from you if you can hold them til tomorrow? 
---
I would love animal companions or mabye even an Eyebot
---
I said I did it over 3 differebt accounts to circumvent the system... Acb you actually read? 
---
Exactly. but for real. I don't see how "fun pvp" waiting half an hour to one shot somebody without any chance for them to resist for 2 desk fans is. 
---
Gotcha. I haven’t been keeping up with the duper problem, so thanks for the info! But an xp boost is also an amazing way to get people to PvP. 
---
I like your idea maybe mention it on new post where the community manager and Bethesda are tagged on it?
---
Gt is manic Mistah J 
---
I got it on release day. I played it for a few days and then got so ~~disappointed~~ irritated that I put it down for a few months. I’ve recently started playing again and I’m really enjoying it. There are much fewer bugs than there were. 
---
You can see others on the map in adventure mode and you’ll run across them every now and again but they’re almost always willing to help out or, at the least, offer a friendly wave before going your separate ways. 
---
If you get lonely, invite a few friends along. If you don’t have any that also play, post a thread here and I’m sure that folks will be happy to pal around with you. 
---
All in all, I’m glad that I came back to it even if there are a few things that I would change if given the option. 
---
Double exp and cap reward weekends occasionally would be nice. I dunno about loot drops tho. 
---
So you bought the game 3 times for this?
---
Because you just said that you did it with 3 different *characters*, not 3 different accounts.
---
Look, constantly changing your version isn't helping your care at all. You might try to fool others, but you sure won't convince me.
---
No one uses them because the reflected slap damage put you in pvp and often you wouldn’t know it until you were dead.  I might actually try them now since slap damage is no more.
---
The main issue in my mind about everyone having to start fresh in survival is where are all the hardcore PvP characters already made going to go? Back to adventure. Adventure has been nice with them having their own place to play.
---
What’s a good spot I’m trying to go and adventure alone I have already 3 of them and luckily lost already all my aid the hard way so no risk of loosing anything other then caps I saw dolly sods spawns a Yao gai with stars 
---
Vision Of Disorder. Old 90s hardcore band. Not sure how they fit into the fallout universe though...
---
I never changed it at all. And you dont have ti buy it 3 times. It's called having a "home Xbox". You havrnt made a single valid point so far. You look really stupid.
---
Dense torso and a rank or two of Fireproof makes the sonic blast trivial.
---
You are a magical creature and I love you!
---
Not sure why you are getting down voted, your comment is spot on. Nobody seems to understand saving...up until a couple of weeks ago the only thing I bought was the Blackbird paint. In the past couple weeks I got a few more paints, including the one to cover up that hideous yellow on the excavator armor. I had &gt; 7K and I still have around 4K and I'm not even trying to grind out the atoms! 
---
I don't PvP well, when I am found by others in survival, I die 90% of the time. That said, I would turn on location for the chance at sweet extra xp.
---
It’s almost harmless now.  Fireproof perk and it’s just annoying because it momentarily blocks views on the screen.  
---
At least it’s not a non stop stream of them anymore.  
---
No problem. Can I charge 500 caps for you to take it, then you charge 700 for me to buy back? 
---
Bye!
---
I'm gonna start a new Survival character because of this post. Wish me luck!
---
GT. Manny sandov on Xbox 
---
Sorry that you are salty enough that you feel the need to insult me.
---
You sure know how to engage in a civilized and mature discussion!
---
I will answer in kind: keep crying like a little kid that "muh badthesda is banning people bcz they are evil!" - only those as childish as you will pay you any attention.
---
Now go cry yourself to sleep or something.
---
Its an express train, stops are few and far between. Most people slept through the last one.
---
Dude its free of charge dont worry about it
---
Temper tantrum much? lol
---
No you just get the bos paint for the helmet when you scrap it 
---
I enjoy all of these changes except for the legendary effects. I want a challenge, js.
---
i am usually sneaked even while in a fight so i never really noticed side movement being slow. usually i can side step 2-3 of the rings since for me they seem to come at me left/right/left/right/left stay centered on the sb and couple steps to side, then back to center, then to other side and i usually avoid most of em.   
---
also full time 3 star fireproof so even if they do hit me they do little to nothing to me just more of an annoyance and lightshow to me, but i have noticed last couple ones to hit me have given me a disease which i had never noticed happening before.
---
First time posting on FO76. This is my first true release. But a tantrum non the less
---
I launched two at the prime site last night, solely because I wanted violet flux. The SBQ was just there as a side prize. Took WAY longer to kill than when I did it before (like two weeks ago) and it seemed my melee hits did less damage then they did before as well. I do agree, once I have enough flux, there's not too much of a point unless I find a bunch of people on the server who've never done the encounter before. The drops kind of suck.
---
Fortnite for example. People want a competitive matchmaking because new players are getting fucked ten times over. 
---
They actually just can’t play the game because of it. 
---
I know this is different because you don’t have to play that mode but still same idea.
---
I wonder if we will be able to roll a new legendary effect onto an item, or if you can only roll already existing effects.
---
In other words, if I want a 3-star shotgun, can I use tokens to roll effects onto a non-legendary shotgun, or do I have to find a 3-star shotgun and then reroll those stars?
---
Oh alright, thank you very much!
---
If you still have it I am on level 21 on PS4
---
You are the one was trying to be condescending first of all. Second you still havent made a single valid point and trying to play off the other person as a "child" is the weakest move you vould possibly pull. It proves you never had anything if value to say in the 1st place.
---
So you're the reason I see hundreds of civil war top hats in vendor inventories...
---
You’re totally right, however you are adding thoughts to the conversation, and that edit was not aimed at you. That edit  came from a place of annoyance when three comments rolled in less than 5 minutes that literally just said “then don’t buy them” and nothing else. I am going to take it out and the comments that have come sense have been hugely positive and add discussion.
---
Spawn camping never been my thing, its almost too easy.  kinda like running the best gear and targeting below lvl 50's.
---
Yeah I know, and I believe the perk party boy doubles or triples the effects of the alcohol, but not length. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, because I'd like to know
---
I am ignorant, what does ‘instanced vault raids’ mean? Like procedurally generated? 
---
just hit me with that invite when you're ready
---
But you're not taking into  account the thousands of free atoms to be had in game. I've been playing since the last week of beta and I've accumulated something like 8K caps in that time. I'm particular about what I buy with them and so I still have around 4k to get whatever I want if it comes up for a limited time, meanwhile I continue to accumulate atoms faster then I spend them. 
---
I see where you’re coming from, but are there not guides online for all of the things mentioned? (Farming spots, perk builds, gear builds..)
---
Not to mention seasonal characters being exclusive to survival mode as well as the other way around wouldn’t make passing down items possible, and would give everyone a fresh start every few months
---
This entire game is an experiment, your either a scientist poking people or a test subject getting mutation injections.
---
I will be selling the new beverages that came with the new dlc very soon. I just need to get a couple more recipes and they'll be available. 
---
Ok well seasonal is different. I thought we were talking about you only need to make a new character once and your good to go forever, not monthly/semi-monthly or like every 3 months or however.
---
I do believe you've triggered some of them. LMAO
---
By any chance do you have a Gamma Gun equipped?  Since the last update I have been experiencing this whenever my Gamma Gun is equipped.  
---
They would have needed to double the number of workshops.
---
Caps yes. Loot was just an idea. I couldn’t see it be balanced enough to be fair and not overpowering 
---
I sent "Mistah J" a message, they said wrong person.
---
My advice to you is don't be in a rush to level. Fallout 76 is not like the other MMOs out there. If your rushing for endgame content, there isn't really any. Enjoy the story. Do events when they pop up. Meet strangers and team up to kill the big scary stuff. I'm not saying the game isn't fun at high levels, but too few things are actually tough enough, and there is no real direction. Enjoy your lowbie time.
---
Umm, hate to burst your rant bubble but BL3 doesn't have a release date yet. The UHD editions of Borderlands 1,2 &amp; the pre sequel are released April 3rd.
---
It works now as intended
---
I think so. Give me a bit to check. Anything to trade?
---
I do not
---
That is exactly where my camp is.  Haha!  Where you able to get the acid resource to work?  
---
I do have a fusion generator, which is the first item I tried to reset.
---
I am near water and unless the crickets/flies audio file is bugged it's not that. It's a loud "electrical buzz" sound that never changes tone, not like crickets or flies
---
What do you want to get out of your build? Having a lot of lvl 1 perks is really not gonna help much as you don't get the best effects until they are leveled up. 
---
I know that’s the premise of the game, but what other game company makes you pay to test their game for them? I know Bethesda retrofits all of their old shit to save money, but to make profit off the development process? Damn... 
---
Second the teapot idea. Get butchers bounty to potentially double your haul
---
What does Brian Collangelo have to do with it?
---
Try the lucky hole mine, pretty sure there are almost if not always some around the outside
---
Oh snap. I’m going to have to check that out. Thanks!
---
Where’s your base at?
---
I still have it
---
Mine is just to the right of vault 76
---
I cant get this to work either. 3 months later /: I found an Anti Armor Fire Ax with this as a secondary effect. I thought it would be beastly but I guess not
---
Indeed, that was sort of my idea by having even just basic Raider and Firebreather groups (see: factions) since it would provide some sort of purpose to fight each other, but more importantly to do it with teamwork instead of 1v1. 
---
My friend had suggested added Factions as a suggestion outright as well, as she'd like there to be a real BoS presence. My only concern is that with BoS, they were very much not a faction which was "for the people" on the whole, but preservation of technology and only those versed enough to work on it or utilize it. On top of that, where would one implement BoS workshops? There's only really 3: Thunderfalls, Fort Defiance, Camp Venture. Of those, only Thunderfalls lacks (IIRC) any quest-related items which if taken over would prevent people from progressing through it. Considering it's already a Workshop, it wouldn't be too hard to declare it exclusive to members of that faction. 
---
I suppose it would be much easier to only have 1 workshop per group as well, but I was originally thinking at least 2 each when thinking of the Firebreathers and Raiders, relating to Positive and Negative Karma. On that note, it'd be plausible for the BoS to only be taken by Neutral players...
---
Either way, there'd have to be some main Workshop that ends up being really pivotal if capture, that all the factions want to fight over, which becomes a bit of a stomping ground for everyone. King of the Hill basically.
---
The main problem with having too many factions is that we're currently limited to 24 players. That's really only a enough to provide a **really** good fight with 2 teams. Some which stay behind to guard, others which venture off to fight/capture. Three CAN still work out well if it were split fairly as that'd leave 8 each, but as a result that would never be the case and it'd be heavily lopsided. Even with 2 I could see it being lopsided. Which with reference to the multiple Raider factions and not working well together, as true as that might be, for ease of implementation, it may have to be acceptable that the Raiders work together since they ultimately ARE on the same side in this context. 
---
I was also trying to keep it simple with the Karma. The only way to enforce it would be a Robotic Police , and... well... Protectrons are kinda easy to outrun, Sentry Bots can't fit through doors lol
---
I think it would be cool to be able to have any animal you pacify with wasteland whisperer be your companion
---
The amount of people with Deathclaw companions would be interesting 
---
Tick blood tequila sunrise? I have that
---
So now its Beth's fault that people cant or won't save? That's an interesting position. I've managed to get all I want out of the atom store without spending a penny out of pocket because I dont jump at every shiny bauble that gets flashed before my eyes!
---
I'd make it look like a nuclear exchange had occurred instead of it looking like the nicest summer day for a walk ever. 
---
Basically every time your group of 4 enters, it creates it specifically for that group, and then after you leave it's gone. It isn't like locations currently where they're static, or the same for everyone basically. 
---
Shotgun ammo really takes too much plastic. If the plastic cost were reduced by like 35% of the current amount, that would feel much more balanced.
---
I just play fallout. The rest is not my thing
---
I definitely recommend a new toon for survival!
---
It's quite a humbling experience knowing you're the smallest on the play yard but still have to find a way to survive
---
Best of luck out there! Watch your train stations, V76 and events, they can be very deadly!
---
It's hilarious that a game has irked you so much you need to throw a tantrum on reddit. Also borderlands 3 doesnt come out April 3rd dumbass, those are the remastered versions of the first 3.
---
Idiot
---
I don't even go after legendaries any more.  They run away and if I follow they only drop garbage (or nothing at all)
---
I support this. Maybe make a real survival mode that requires you to wear raider gear like fonv to be a raider
---
Instigating Broadsider. I don't use it much, but when I do I have a grin that won't stop watching anything I shoot fly off into the distance with one shot.
---
BE weapons deal so much damage that 45% damage reduction from fireproof is not enought. You need dense chest mod and some cavalier/sentinel pieces to survive even one point blank hit from those
---
Tanagra town, big Arse tree. 
---
Are you seriously complaining that they're listening to feedback and changing the game as they go along? 
---
This isn't a single player game that gets two DLCs and then they never touch it again. It's going to keep evolving and I don't see how even the biggest haters of this game could say that's a bad thing.
---
It’s in the cranberry bog location 
---
It means that only thouse 4 players play in that dungeon. If other people will play the same dungeon, they will generate a new one.
---
If you are on pc I can craft you one
---
See, it’s like 1% of your budget when it would cost nothing to knock. More room for succulents!
---
That's actually what *Star Trek Online* does for its "re-engineering" system. You can Lock specific modifiers, then spend a few in-game currencies to do a slot-machine style randomizer on the unlocked ones. If you get ones you like, lock those, and then run it again on the others.
---
Agreed. At least for the beta. 
---
More unsellable items incoming
---
This guy.... 
---
Sorry I wasn't available earlier, but I sent you a friend request on Discord. I should be available tomorrow, though I'm on EST (it's almost 8 PM for me right now), so it'd be best to do it in the morning for me, which would be around 9 EST.
---
Only can lay two at a time. 
---
Not a stable energy source
